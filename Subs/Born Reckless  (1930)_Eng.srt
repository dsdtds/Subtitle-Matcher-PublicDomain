1
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:50,352
<i>Louis? Louis?</i>

2
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:53,158
<i>- Beretti?
- Shh!</i>

3
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:01,128
Put that out, you sap!
Don't you know no better than that?

4
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:05,132
- Hey, is this your hack?

5
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,473
This? Sure.

6
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,213
Well, what's your name?

7
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,079
Mine?
Joe Fleischer.

8
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:15,381
- Fleischer.
- Yeah.

9
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:36,169
Say, Cassidy.

10
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,904
Look up, uh, taxicab 67081-19.

11
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:42,912
And hustle it.

12
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:54,750
Let's go.

13
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,692
Let's go, Big.

14
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,544
- Everybody okay?

15
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,554
- Okay, Big.
- Nobody hit?

16
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,386
Nobody hit.
All right, Joe, step on it.

17
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:30,291
- Get under that elevated quick. Come on!
- We're all right, Louis.

18
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:55,350
- Louis.
- Here.

19
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,353
- How's tricks, Sal?
- Oh, tough.

20
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,355
- Yeah?
- I figure on usin' dishwater for soup tonight.

21
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:02,290
Yeah? Well, here's a buck.
Get yourself some ham and eggs.

22
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,659
- If you eat ham. Do you? Yeah, you do, all right.
- Oh, thanks.

23
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,221
It's all right.
Bighearted, huh?

24
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,533
- Well?
- Gee, you sure look swell in that makeup.

25
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:19,098
- Yeah?
- A regular working guy.

26
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,543
Aw, go on.
I'll sock you in the jaw.

27
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:26,447
Nobody'd wanna work
but a dumb guy, see?

28
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,542
- How is it, babe? All right?
- Swell.

29
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,611
So long.

30
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,032
- Hello, Mom.
- Luigi!

31
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,796
- Hello, Pop.

32
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,704
How are ya?
You're all right, Mom, huh?

33
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,810
Working so hard, my boy.
Sit down.

34
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,747
Yeah. Yeah, those bosses
think a truck driver ain't got no home.

35
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,807
Late delivery
over there in Greenpoint.

36
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,819
How about the old spaghetti?

37
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,017
- They make you work too much, those bosses.
- Yeah.

38
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:11,994
- They are drive-slavers.
- "Drive-slavers."

39
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,997
The old man.

40
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:44,928
Say, who's in there?

41
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:48,727
Rosita has a nice young man there.

42
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,700
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,382
Okay. Okay.

44
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,965
Louis, you know I don't paint.

45
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,978
You better not.

46
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:40,206
Who is this guy, Rosa?

47
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:43,117
I, uh-Well, you see,
Mr. Beretti, I'm-

48
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:45,246
I know, I know.

49
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:53,256
What are your intentions, fella?

50
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:03,229
Mr. Beretti,
my intentions are quite-

51
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:08,267
Okay. I can tell by lookin' at ya that
you don't mean nothing wrong.

52
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,347
How are you?

53
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,406
Oh, Louis.

54
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:18,654
My sister's a good girl, fella.

55
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:20,714
She'd better be.

56
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,995
I'm gonna take you down to the club
tonight after supper, fella.

57
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,564
I want you to meet my friends.
They're a great gang.

58
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,132
I'll send him back to you, Sis.

59
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,298
I'll close the door.

60
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,694
- Her first suitor.
- Her first.

61
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,665
He seems... okay.

62
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:08,896
- I come to see Rosa, Mrs. Beretti.
- Rosa?

63
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,957
Why, Rosa, she don't-
she don't- I don't-

64
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,969
Rosa ain't home.

65
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:15,631
- Oh, she ain't home, huh?
- No, she ain't.

66
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:19,938
And what's more,
she's never gonna be home... to you.

67
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,003
Well, you needn't get sore
about it, Louis.

68
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,783
- You're just in time, Louis.

69
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:36,827
- Okay?
- Okay. They're in Jersey by now.

70
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:39,954
Say, I got a guy out here
I want you fellas to meet.

71
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,488
I want you to give him the once-over.
He wants to marry my sister.

72
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,229
I'll bring him in.

73
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:48,294
All right, fella.

74
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:52,901
This guy's name is Banks.
Banks, meet the mob.

75
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,673
- Where'd you pick that up?
- None of your business.

76
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:59,546
That's a fine-lookin' mug you picked out
for a brother-in-law.

77
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:03,610
- You ever take a good look at yourself?
- She's a good girl- Rosa.

78
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,015
How much dough you got?

79
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:12,422
$826.71.

80
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:15,431
He's got it, even the 71 cents.

81
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,433
<i>You'll be needin' some furniture.</i>

82
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:20,800
<i>- I know where I can pick up
a swell set of mission, cheap.
- Never mind.</i>

83
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,431
Where you got the dough?

84
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,941
Court Square Trust Company.

85
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,740
That's a tough bank, all right.

86
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:31,337
- Isn't my money safe there?
- Too safe.

87
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,883
What do you say, boys?
Is he okay?

88
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:37,011
<i>- Okay by me.
- Hey, Ritzy, what do you think?</i>

89
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,959
Well, if he’s sap enough to get married,
it's okay, I guess.

90
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,894
Say, when it comes to your sister...

91
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,991
you're not strong for your own mob,
are you, Louis?

92
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:53,628
Meanin' yourself?

93
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,331
Any objections?

94
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,074
I've seen what's happened to dames
who hook up with guys like you.

95
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:04,080
Well, it ain't gonna happen to my sister.
Get that?

96
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,978
- Now, look here-
- Louis's right.

97
00:11:08,052 --> 00:11:10,145
Come on, fella.
We'll go see Father McCann.

98
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,090
So long, four eyes.

99
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:20,094
Say, who are you callin' four eyes?

100
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:22,098
- Come here.
- Be a good boy.

101
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,964
- Okay.
- He's all right at that, huh?

102
00:11:25,035 --> 00:11:26,969
He's got a little
rooster in him at that.

103
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:31,667
Come on, beau. So long.

104
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:34,233
I don't like to be called four eyes.

105
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,769
Okay, Charlie, my boy.
Okay.

106
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:51,519
- Hello, Louis.
- Hello, Good News. How are you?

107
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:55,390
What's your hurry?

108
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,869
Shoot. What is it this time, a rap?

109
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:03,100
Go on into the house, Charlie,
and tell Mom not to worry.

110
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,698
Tell her I'll be out late...
on business.

111
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,438
We're gonna take a little walk.

112
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:12,414
Hey, tell her I won't
be home at all tonight.

113
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,755
- Hello, Cardigan.
- Hello, Bill.

114
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,054
- Lookin' for a story?
- That's what I get paid for.

115
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,618
That's wrong.
That's what I get underpaid for.

116
00:12:25,696 --> 00:12:28,961
You know about that mob that's been
raising Cain on the Lower East Side?

117
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,900
- Sure.
- Well, I got three of them tonight
in a jewelry robbery.

118
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:35,666
That's a frame-up.
I work for my livin'.

119
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,969
<i>Yeah? What do you do?</i>

120
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,306
I truck.

121
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:43,369
Let me look at your hand.

122
00:12:43,447 --> 00:12:45,608
Never done a day's work in his life.

123
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:50,585
Let me look at yours.
No calluses on that hand either.

124
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,679
Now, you better frisk 'em.

125
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,871
Huh. Take a look at those, Bill.

126
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,679
Draft cards, huh?

127
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:28,814
- What are you gonna do with 'em, Cardigan?
- Up the river.

128
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:36,024
Listen, I'm gonna do you a great big favor
and grab a front-page spread for myself.

129
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,695
Yeah? What do you got on your mind?
Spit it out.

130
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,035
Let 'em go to war.
Great story.

131
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:48,204
Gangs-gunmen, see-
turned loose, given a chance to do their bit.

132
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:51,805
Patriotism, see?
Safe for democracy.

133
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:54,350
You're a Democrat,
aren't you? You are.

134
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,477
The primaries are
next month, aren't they?

135
00:13:56,553 --> 00:14:00,011
They are.
"Cardigan for city court judge.

136
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,082
A real patriot."
Get me?

137
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,594
Mm-hmm. Hmm!

138
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,757
I was kinda thinkin'
about that myself.

139
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,234
I knew you were.
I'll quote you.

140
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:20,274
I'm gonna give you three guys the greatest
opportunity you ever had in your life.

141
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:22,835
You're tough guys. Gunmen.
You wanna shoot.

142
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:25,541
Well, I'm gonna give you a gun
and make soldiers out of you...

143
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,710
instead of lettin' you eat your head off
up there at Elmira.

144
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,845
Sort of probation.
I'm gonna keep this evidence in my safe...

145
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:33,913
for the duration of the war.

146
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:36,653
After it's all over,
you can come back and report to me.

147
00:14:36,727 --> 00:14:40,493
If you've made good,
we'll tear up the complaints.

148
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,759
If you haven't,
you're gonna take the rap!

149
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,427
<i>You get me?</i>

150
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:48,665
- Are you kiddin' us, Cardigan?
- That's a great idea, Chief.

151
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:52,106
Why, fighting's their racket.
You let these three guys go to France...

152
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:55,804
and the whole East Side
will be proud of them.

153
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:58,796
Here's your cards.

154
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:08,647
I envy you men...

155
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:12,312
this opportunity
of fighting for the right.

156
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,187
- You're better men than I am.
- Gunga Din.

157
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:18,852
<i>- Okay, Chief.
- Okay, let 'em go.</i>

158
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,897
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

159
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,265
I knew there was
a catch in it somewhere.

160
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:32,830
<i>- You'll need that to get you up in the army.</i>

161
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,917
Fall in! Hold your heads up!

162
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,550
Throw that butt away!
Put your heels together!

163
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:53,094
Now, Sergeant,
don't you think it would be more advisable-

164
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,426
Now, just a moment, sir.
Please let us handle this...

165
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,557
or you’ll have it all balled up.

166
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:01,432
- Hey, what's your line, fella?
- Ballplayer.

167
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,733
Send him to noncom school.

168
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,466
<i>- How about you?
- Lightweight.</i>

169
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,474
<i>- Thug, huh?
- No- iceman.</i>

170
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,806
Garbage detail.

171
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,937
Sergeant, I'm a certified
public accountant.

172
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,574
I hold two degrees in accountancy.

173
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,312
I've done expert work
for some of the biggest firms in the country.

174
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:19,650
Just now I'm employed by Whiting-Small,
a mail-order house.

175
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:23,782
Don't know if I can be of any use to you
around here, but if you need a good C.P.A. -

176
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,054
Horseshoer.
What are you?

177
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:27,652
Irish.

178
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:32,132
Give him a gun. What do you do, buddy?

179
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,636
I don't do anything.
I go to college.

180
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,003
How about sending him
to noncom school?

181
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:41,133
Ah, them guys don't know nothin'.

182
00:16:42,644 --> 00:16:45,875
Say, you gotta watch those things, Sarge.
You know?

183
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:48,142
Hey, what's your line, feller?

184
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,707
Me?

185
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm in the jewelry business.

186
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:56,781
<i>Well, how would you like to dig toils
with the latrine squad?</i>

187
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,753
Well, yes and no.

188
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,821
<i>What do you do?</i>

189
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,502
I'm a burglar.

190
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,471
Hey, Sarge,
that's just the guy you're lookin' for.

191
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,474
Hey, Sarge, just the guy
you're lookin' for!

192
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,476
Hey, Sarge,
he's just the guy you're lookin' for!

193
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:17,842
<i>Hey, Corporal,
just the guy you're lookin' for.!</i>

194
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,847
<i>Attention.! Attention.!</i>

195
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:38,698
- All you men, get in line up there!

196
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:45,065
- Well, Frank, my boy.
- Hey, doc, you got a match?

197
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:58,746
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

198
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,780
And, uh, don't ever ask any of those officers
with gold bars for a match.

199
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:07,727
- They'll have you shot.
- Okay, doc.

200
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,061
Frank, my boy...

201
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,067
I came down here looking for you.

202
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,035
Brought your sister with me too.

203
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:18,732
What is the meaning of this?
Why aren't you at Plattsburg?

204
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,605
Well, I thought I'd do
better in this business as a private.

205
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,577
Oh, think of your family, my boy.
You belong to-

206
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:28,082
I don't wanna be a hero.
If it's ever curtains for anyone around me...

207
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,175
I don't wanna have
any responsibility.

208
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:33,278
I'm sorry I can't
have you along with me.

209
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:35,653
Frank, aren't you going
to speak to me?

210
00:18:35,724 --> 00:18:39,216
Jo! What are you doin' down here, monkey?
Hello, Uncle Jim.

211
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:42,388
Oh, I want you to meet
my friend Louis Beretti.

212
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:44,489
Louis and I have decided
that we're gonna be buddies.

213
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,330
How do you do, young man?
How do you do?

214
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,996
Oh- How are you?

215
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,505
Jo, I want you to meet Louis too.

216
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,599
Louis, this is my sister Joan.

217
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,043
She's a great girl, but she's kind of fond
of herself.

218
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:00,809
Pleased- Pardon me, doc.

219
00:19:00,882 --> 00:19:03,282
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Beretti?

220
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,718
I hope Frank can bring you down to see us
whenever they let you off.

221
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:08,722
So do I.

222
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,726
I'm sure you'll both be captains before
it's over over there.

223
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:15,456
Well, he's made
a good start already.

224
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,158
- You're right, General.
- Thanks, thanks.

225
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:25,501
All these men offering
themselves to their country.

226
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:28,600
They've come from
the highways and the byways...

227
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:31,043
the machine shop and the store.

228
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:34,604
They've dropped
the plowshare for the sword.

229
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:37,811
It's upon the lives
of such men as these...

230
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,480
that our country must rely...

231
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,649
to bare their open, manly breasts...

232
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:46,785
to the beast that is ravishing
the motherland.

233
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:48,796
Somebody swiped my watch!

234
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,799
All right, pick up your bags.

235
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,966
Hold up your heads!
Pull in your chins and your bellies!

236
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,033
Squads, right!
Ho!

237
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:07,878
<i>One, two, three, four.!
One, two, three, four.!</i>

238
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,520
I told 'em I was a burglar.

239
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,047
<i>- Look what they give me.
- Hut, two, three, four.</i>

240
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:20,924
<i>Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.</i>

241
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:48,886
- Oh!

242
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,873
<i>- How many times have I told you-
- Hey.!</i>

243
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:25,356
Hey, you lop-eared,
screw-eyed sons of-

244
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:31,590
Oh, excuse me, Father.
I didn't know you was the umpire.

245
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:36,035
Hey, why don't youse guys make home plate
that manure pile and bat the other way?

246
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:39,767
<i>- Do you wanna kill somebody?
- Aw, go wash your face.!</i>

247
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:12,302
- Come on!
- Let's beat it!

248
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:16,603
- What is it, a German?
- Here.

249
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,548
You mule-eared, dog-faced...

250
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,386
<i>son of a pop-eyed-</i>

251
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,621
That general can swear
as good as I can.

252
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:09,720
Big Shot just sent us over
another bunch of cigarettes from home.

253
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:11,732
I guess he must've been
robbing a warehouse.

254
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,702
Well, I hope they don't catch him
before the war's over.

255
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,937
Oh, uh...

256
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,944
you heard from your sister lately?

257
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,003
Yeah.

258
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,278
She sent me this.
Nice fit, isn't it?

259
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:35,220
Yeah. Well, I got a postal card
from her myself.

260
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,782
Hey, you've told me about that postal card
about 50 times.

261
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,694
Why don't you have it
framed or something?

262
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:44,698
I think maybe I will.

263
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:48,862
Yeah, and hang it on the fireplace
under your crossed "spoys."

264
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:55,106
Your spoys.
You know, your spoys.

265
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:58,043
- Spoys.
- Oh!

266
00:23:58,113 --> 00:24:00,172
- You mean my spoys?
- Yeah, that's it.

267
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:04,915
I think I'll-Well, well!

268
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:07,216
Hello, Cheri, old girl.
How are ya?

269
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:09,381
<i>- Bonjour, monsieur.

00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:16,024
Hey, Cheri, get a load of that.

271
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:19,566
Papa!

272
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:26,539
"Papa, sugar." Say, listen.
I'll tell you what I want you to do.

273
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:29,441
I want you to get me three or four bottles
of your best grape.

274
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:35,041
You know, grape.
Grape. Look.

275

Flatterer.

277
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,656
Nice girl, full of good, clean fun.

278
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,128
<i>Come on.
Let's have the wine, huh, baby? Come on.</i>

279
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,790
<i>- Come on?
- Yeah, come on. Get it.</i>

280
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,392
Huh? No, look, look.
Wine, wine. Grape.

281
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,461
You know, look.

282
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:03,265
Mmm!

283
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:09,575
- She don't need Papa now.
- Marie?

284
00:25:15,256 --> 00:25:17,281
M-Oh!

285
00:25:40,548 --> 00:25:43,847
Hey, I thought you was a sergeant.
Where's your stripes?

286
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,453
Who handed me that bat?

287
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:06,805
Get a load of that.
See that?

288
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:08,808
- Ooh!

00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:11,367
Yeah, see?
Now, listen.

00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:14,506
You, me-

That's the price in Bar-le-Duc.

296
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:28,919
Say, wait a minute.

297

There.
Now, how about that?

298
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:35,362
No.

<i>- No?

Oh, baby, you're tough.

00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:50,450
- There.
- Ooh!

302
00:26:50,518 --> 00:26:53,146
Those are Paris prices, baby.

<i>C'est très cher.</i>

Come here, baby.

306

Oh, Sherman was wrong.

00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:44,398
<i>- Come on.! Let's go.!</i>

308
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:20,627
<i>Louis Beretti reporting, sir.</i>

309
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,274
- Hello, Beretti. How are ya?
- Hello there, O'Brien.

310
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:29,278
- Glad to see you.
- Judge.

311
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:32,213
You oughta remember Louis Beretti.
You know, that jewelry job.

312
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:35,342
You oughta remember what that red,
white and blue whiskey did for you.

313
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,217
Sure. Cut out your kiddin', Bill.
Glad to see you, Beretti.

314
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:40,518
- Glad to see you, Judge.
- But wasn't there three of you?

315
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:42,684
- Yeah.
- The red, white and blue.

316
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,523
I'm reporting
for Gibbons and Donley too.

317
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:47,655
What became of Gibbons?

318
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:51,030
On the Rhine.
Army of Occupation.

319
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,365
And Donley?

320
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:55,667
Bumped off in the Argonne.

321
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:59,835
The spirit of patriotism, Beretti.
The spirit of patriotism.

322
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,107
- When you were standing in the mud of Flanders-
- In the Argonne.

323
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,114
Of the Argonne,
we were beside you...

324
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:07,275
trudging forward step by step...

325
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,342
while you vanquished a stubborn foe.

326
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,444
Oh!
Were you there too, Judge?

327
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,887
In spirit only.
In spirit.

328
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:16,425
Anyway, I'm glad you're back
and squared your account...

329
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:18,518
and I hope you'll
always keep it that way.

330
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:22,497
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,
I'm goin' into business now myself.

331
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:26,093
- Jewelry?
- No, no, no. Something respectable.

332
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,969
- Splendid!
- Oh, uh-

333
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,567
Oh, Judge, I, uh-
You-

334
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,204
- Hey, get these guys back, will ya?

335
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,441
- You're all right, Louis.
- Sure.

336
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:40,915
- Back in your old neighborhood.
- Hello there, Mike.

337
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,782
- How are ya? How's the veterinary?
- Great.

338
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:46,015
Hello, Joe. How are ya?
How's Big Kate?

339
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:49,923
Same as ever, and some cook.

340
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,520
- Hey, Judge, you, uh-you know Donley?
- Yes.

341
00:31:53,597 --> 00:31:56,691
Well, uh, you know,
he didn't have no folks, see?

342
00:31:56,767 --> 00:32:00,999
And he was kind of dragged up in
an orphanage and that kind of stuff.

343
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:03,665
And, well, I was with him
in the hospital...

344
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,109
before, uh- before he bumped off.

345
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:13,138
He said,
"Louis, give these to Cardigan."

346
00:32:57,427 --> 00:33:00,919
Luigi. Luigi.

347
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:03,465
- Papa.
- Luigi.

348
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:14,934
Hey, Ma.

349
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,271
Look, I brought you some flowers.

350
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:21,681
Oh, by Garibaldi...

351
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:24,243
what a fine soldier he is, eh?

352
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:26,881
Look, Mama. Look. See?

353
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:30,688
What I tell you?
Don't I tell you Luigi win the war?

354
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:34,595
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Pop.
I didn't win the whole war.

355
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,757
There was a couple
of other guys fightin'.

356
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,824
Listen to him, Mama.

357
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:41,530
Just like his papa.

358
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:45,769
Luigi, a fight, she never stop...

359
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:48,868
until a Beretti steps in.

360
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,845
Hey, Pop, wait a minute.

361
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:53,747
Look what I brought you.

362
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:57,082
- For me, huh?
- Nothin' else.

363
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:01,551
Oh.

364
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,926
<i>Hey, Ma, where's Rosa?</i>

365
00:34:12,736 --> 00:34:15,705
- Louis.
- Rosina!

366
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,874
Rosina.

367
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:30,113
Hey, wait'll you see
what I brought you.

368
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:32,451
Hey, what's the big idea?

369
00:34:32,522 --> 00:34:35,423
You're wearing mourning
'cause I come home again?

370
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,017
That's a fine way
to mee-

371
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,231
Say, Rosa, what's wrong?

372
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:48,135
What's happened?
Where's Charlie?

373
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:59,939
Rosa's baby...
got no papa now.

374
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:06,548
Gee.

375
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:08,614
Gee, that's tough.

376
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,318
Poor kid.

377
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:16,760
It's tough to lose your man.

378
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,393
One of the toughest things
in the world, I guess.

379
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:23,968
Ah, there, there, now.
Don't-

380
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,974
Don't worry, kid.

381
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:30,877
I'll take care of you,
and I'll take care of the little one too.

382
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,006
Now, now, don't worry.

383
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:36,849
Don't worry. Poor kid.

384
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:46,351
What was it?
What happened?

385
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,974
It was a robbery.

386
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:04,981
Charlie had the payroll
of the-

387
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:09,176
Killed?

388
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,949
Who did it? Who killed him?
Who did it?

389
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:15,992
No, no, Louis.
That won't bring Charlie back.

390
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,425
- You know who it was. Now, tell me.
- No, Louis, I don't.

391
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:20,759
- Come on. You must know who it was.
- No, Louis, no.

392
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,890
- I don't. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell!
- You know who it was. Tell me!

393
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,707
- What was his name?

394
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,471
Oh, no, Louis. No, no.
I know what you'll do.

395
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:38,036
More killing, more trouble.
Prison.

396
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:41,447
Oh, I don't wanna lose
anyone else that I love, Louis.

397
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:43,782
Rosa is right, my dear.

398
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:47,118
Oh, let us thank God
that you came back safe.

399
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,420
That's all right
about me coming back.

400
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:53,121
But while I'm away, a rat sneaks into my home
and kills one of my family.

401
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,130
Am I gonna let him
get away with that?

402
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:57,530
Am I gonna stand for a rat
making a mug out of me?

403
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:00,297
- Come on, now. You know who it was.
- No, Louis, I can't!

404
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,769
Tell me, you hear me?

405
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:12,480
I swear it, Louis!

406
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,540
I swear it!

407
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:45,781
I'll find him.

408
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:48,181
I swear it.

409
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:50,913
If it takes me all my life,
I'll find him.

410
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:52,978
And when I do-

411
00:37:57,894 --> 00:38:00,158
Funny thing.

412
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,133
Sometimes, I got to feelin'
like he was my own brother.

413
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:09,729
And then for him to get it like that.
A game guy like him.

414
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:16,101
I think Frank would like to have heard you
call him that-a game kid.

415
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,445
Oh, I never did fall
for that hero bunk.

416
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:24,920
But there's some guys you'd go the whole way for,
others you wouldn't.

417
00:38:24,988 --> 00:38:30,585
Well, Frank was the kind of a guy
you'd go the limit for.

418
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:40,532
Just as he-
Just as he was-

419
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:48,476
Just as he was... leaving...

420
00:38:48,545 --> 00:38:51,309
he told me to tell you...

421
00:38:51,381 --> 00:38:55,374
that he did his best to-
to win his spoys.

422
00:38:55,452 --> 00:38:58,250
Well, if he didn't,
I don't know who did.

423
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:01,017
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you were there, Louis.

424
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:04,952
Then he said, uh...

425
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,362
if you ever needed anybody...

426
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,201
you could call on me.

427
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,636
I will.

428
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:21,643
I'll always remember what Frank called you-
a great guy.

429
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:24,976
Well, I'm not.

430
00:39:25,048 --> 00:39:27,141
But I've always-

431
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:31,711
I've always wanted to be
a-a great guy.

432
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:41,692
You know, Joan...

433
00:39:41,765 --> 00:39:46,566
I could try to be a great guy...

434
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:48,604
if you could see-

435
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:57,107
Oh, Dick.
You're just in time to meet Louis Beretti.

436
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,014
Louis, this is Dick Milburn.
I've told you all about Louis.

437
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:04,542
- He and Frank were chums.
They were together when-
- I know, dear.

438
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:06,680
- Glad to know you, Beretti.
- Glad to meet you, sir.

439
00:40:06,756 --> 00:40:10,886
You'll stay to dinner with Dick and me?
That is, if you don't mind Dick.

440
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,451
He's going to be my- my husband.

441
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,998
Aren't you?

442
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:19,364
Thanks, Joan,
but l-I, uh- I can't stay to dinner.

443
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:22,666
- Yes, you can.
- No, l-I can't. You see, l-

444
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:25,173
Well, l-I can't.

445
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,402
- Do you mind if I have another cigarette?
- No.

446
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:30,935
Well, old man, if you really have to beat it,
I'll run you down to the station.

447
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,141
No, thanks.
I'd-I'd rather walk.

448
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:36,674
You see, I got so used to walking in the army
that I kind of like it.

449
00:40:36,753 --> 00:40:39,551
- Now, Louis Beretti, you're not going-
- Now, now, Joan.

450
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:42,785
So long. Lots of luck to you.
So long, Joan.

451
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:45,885
If you ever need anybody,
why, look me up.

452
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,260
Good-bye. So long.
Good luck.

453
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,901
Bye.

454
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:54,960
Good luck.

455
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:31,405
Hello, Needle, old boy.
How have you been? Full house.

456
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,806
Lot of important people out there.
They workin' you hard?

457
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:37,438
I've walked about 10 miles behind this bar today.
Take a peek at them dogs.

458
00:41:37,513 --> 00:41:39,481
- They're swelterin'.
- Dancin' pumps. You know what they oughta-

459
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:42,177
They oughta get dust boards back there
for you guys to walk on.

460
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:45,744
Let me have a little shot.
Louis's bottle right behind you there.

461
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:50,926
- First today.
- Old Taylor, Needle.

462
00:41:50,994 --> 00:41:53,326
Okay.

463
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:55,694
Everything's on the Old "Taylorino."

464
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:58,233
That's right, Bill, plenty of water.

465
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,166
- That stuff'll burn your guts out.
- Yep.

466
00:42:00,236 --> 00:42:04,434
Doctor told me that one time. Never drink
it straight. Always put something in it.

467
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:07,840
Listen, I knew a guy once that went to one
of those temperance lectures uptown.

468
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:11,278
You know, that tells you about all that booze
does to your insides.

469
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:14,282
Hobnails on your liver
and "very close" veins.

470
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,409
Well, he went on a buttermilk diet.

471
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,784
And what do you think
happened to him?

472
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:21,346
In three weeks, the guy is dead.

473
00:42:21,424 --> 00:42:23,392
- No!
- Yes, sir.

474
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:26,189
Run over by a streetcar.

475
00:42:26,262 --> 00:42:28,594
Hi, Needle, old boy.
How 'bout a shot?

476
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,963
Listen, nix on the booze.
The main gee just called up.

477
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:33,434
He wants you fellas downtown right away.
So you'd better screw.

478
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:34,993
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

479
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,309
Okay!

480
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:43,311
What's up, Needle?

481
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:45,313
The boys are havin'
a little party down there.

482
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:47,645
The main gee
is goin' to the "cansky" in the morning.

483
00:42:47,717 --> 00:42:49,651
- I heard about it.
- Hello, Needle.

484
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,653
- How are ya?
- How about a brandy and soda?

485
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:53,655
Nix on the "bransky."
You better get goin' downtown.

486
00:42:53,723 --> 00:42:55,748
The main gee just called up,
and you better hustle.

487
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,816
Hello, Moe.

488
00:43:01,898 --> 00:43:04,833
- Oh, Sir Maurice.
- How do you do, Miss, uh-

489
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:06,892
Sir Maurice,
may I present some of my friends?

490
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,835
I'd be delighted, I'm sure.

491
00:43:08,905 --> 00:43:10,896
This is Sir Maurice Mos-

492
00:43:10,974 --> 00:43:13,204
...cowitz.

493
00:43:13,276 --> 00:43:15,506
Sir Maurice Moscovich.

494
00:43:15,578 --> 00:43:19,070
Sir Maurice was with me in the taxi
that night when I lost my diamonds.

495
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:21,912
Oh, yes, very valuable
and beautiful diamonds.

496
00:43:21,985 --> 00:43:24,886
- Oh, but you were so kind and helpful.
- Oh, not at all.

497
00:43:24,954 --> 00:43:27,650
Well, if you'll excuse me,
really, I must push along now.

498
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:30,591
- May I call sometime?
- Oh, please do. I should be delighted.

499
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,595
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

500
00:43:33,663 --> 00:43:36,257
<i>- Good-bye.
- Au revoir.</i>

501
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:38,698
Charming chap. Very fine family.

502
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:40,895
Real nobility, you know.
All that sort of thing.

503
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,530
Oh, uh, a slug of gin.

504
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,775
- How are ya?
- Louis Beretti!

505
00:43:50,847 --> 00:43:52,781
Sit down, fellas.
Sit down. It's all right.

506
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:54,783
I'm so glad I know you, Louis.

507
00:43:54,851 --> 00:43:58,252
It's much easier to get into the social register
than into your place.

508
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:01,119
Well, there's always a table
for you, Mrs. Milburn.

509
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:05,991
"Mrs. Milburn."
May I call you Mr. Beretti, Louis?

510
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:08,758
Sure, Joan.

511
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,026
Oh, this is Louis Beretti, our host.

512
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,398
- Mr. And Mrs. Fairfield.
- How do you do?

513
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:15,403
- How do you do?
- How are you, old man?

514
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,063
- You remember Dick.
- Sure.

515
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,074
- How are you, Beretti?
- Hiya, skipper.

516
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:21,940
Louis and I are old friends,
although I always have a hard time...

517
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:24,138
making him ask me to dance.

518
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:27,979
Well, you see, I've been too busy to dance.
I've almost forgotten how.

519
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:31,953
- I don't believe that.

520
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:34,285
Well, uh, would you-

521
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:38,350
- would you care to have a little drag with me?
- Certainly.

522
00:45:46,302 --> 00:45:48,770
- Hello, Big.
- Hello, Sally.

523
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:51,602
- Gettin' fat, aren't ya?
- Eatin' regular.

524
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:54,108
How about your hat?
Is your head cold?

525
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:58,674
- Never mind.
- Okay.

526
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,421
What's on your mind, Big?

527
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,515
Got to take the rap.

528
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:21,552
You what-
You didn't beat that case?

529
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,564
Gee.

530
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,328
I never thought they'd put you
behind the bars.

531
00:47:28,104 --> 00:47:31,267
- I'm sorry, Big.
- The appeal was denied.

532
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,366
Yeah. Brophy's case was too tight.

533
00:47:34,443 --> 00:47:38,038
Beats me how he had everything lined up
in court the way he did-

534
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:40,344
the cars, the witnesses, the fence.

535
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,850
Yeah, witnesses to everything.

536
00:47:42,918 --> 00:47:44,852
- Say, he ain't smart enough-
- Good-night, Louis.

537
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,979
- Night.
- To figure things out for himself...

538
00:47:47,056 --> 00:47:49,217
without somebody rattin'.

539
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,691
You think somebody
turned you in, Big?

540
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:55,197
Sure, and I think I know who it is.

541
00:47:55,264 --> 00:47:57,698
Yeah?

542
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:01,498
My bail bond's up tomorrow.

543
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,198
You know, Louis,
I'd like to see your old lady...

544
00:48:04,273 --> 00:48:06,741
before I go away.

545
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:10,939
Sure, Big. Sure.

546
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,573
Hey, Sally,
bring me my benny and lid.

547
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:15,583
Come on.
I'll go along with you.

548
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:18,279
Hey, uh, Pete. Wait here.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

549
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,616
Okay.

550
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,918
- How's business?
- Oh, fine. Everything's going okay.

551
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:36,128
You be in the inspector's office at 9:00
in the morning and tell him what you know.

552
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,639
- Do you understand?
- All right, Good News.

553
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,676
- I'll be there.
- You'd better be.

554
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:04,098
What's the meeting for?
What's happening tonight?

555
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:08,068
Big Shot wants to tell us something
before he goes up the river tomorrow.

556
00:49:08,137 --> 00:49:10,469
Well, what's he bothering about?
After tomorrow...

557
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:12,632
somebody else will be giving orders.

558
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,642
Not meaning yourself, old fellow?

559
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,577
And why not?
Big Shot will be up the river.

560
00:49:17,646 --> 00:49:19,773
I'll be sending him cigarettes.

561
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:22,818
Thanks, Ritzy.
I might need 'em.

562
00:49:22,885 --> 00:49:26,946
Oh, hello, Big Shot.
I was just talking about you.

563
00:49:27,022 --> 00:49:28,956
How's the uptown joint going, Louis?

564
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:30,958
Great.
Full up every night.

565
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:33,085
- Fine. Get me a table, will you?
- Sure.

566
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:36,495
Call up to my place and have Bugs reserve
a table for Ritzy Reilly.

567
00:49:36,565 --> 00:49:39,363
- Okay.
- I got a date with a little blonde.

568
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:43,235
One of those young things from upstate.
She thinks I'm going to marry her.

569
00:49:43,305 --> 00:49:44,932
Well, that's good.

570
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,407
Yeah, that's good.

571
00:49:47,476 --> 00:49:51,936
Yeah, table in the corner for Ritzy Reilly.
Yeah, Louis says it's okay.

572
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:55,347
It's a pip, ain't it?
She's up in her flat now packing.

573
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:58,853
I just left her at the door a moment ago
while I came up here.

574
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:01,719
Well, it's too bad we didn't get around
a little sooner.

575
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:06,056
<i>I always like to take a look at the blondes
you travel around with.</i>

576
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,187
What are you doin',
spillin' your guts to her?

577
00:50:08,264 --> 00:50:10,824
- Shut up, Joe!
- No, Ritzy's too smart for that.

578
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,266
He knows enough not to take her down
to Atlantic City...

579
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:16,566
after that jam he got in with a little redhead
down there.

580
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,075
How did you beat that rap?

581
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,474
What are you guys doing,
giving me the third degree?

582
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,513
- How did you beat that rap?
- Oh, shut up.

583
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,549
How did you beat that rap?

584
00:50:27,616 --> 00:50:30,449
She swore she was my niece.
That's how I beat it.

585
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:32,953
Brophy took her down to
the D.A.'s office, and she-

586
00:50:33,022 --> 00:50:34,956
Oh, Brophy took her.

587
00:50:35,024 --> 00:50:38,926
- Yeah.
- So that's how Brophy got ya.

588
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,928
Made you turn stool pigeon...

589
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,430
so you wouldn't have to serve a few months
in the can.

590
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,730
Double-crossed your own mob, huh?

591
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:50,135
Turned in Big to save
your own rotten hide.

592
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:55,576
Say, this room ain't big enough for both of us.
This town ain't big enough.

593
00:50:55,644 --> 00:50:58,977
So if you ever bump into me,
you better see me first...

594
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:02,142
ya dirty, sneakin' rat!

595
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:11,084
That guy's getting high-hat ever since he got
that new joint uptown.

596
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,720
Scram, you guys!

597
00:51:13,796 --> 00:51:16,128
Well, cheerio, Ritzy old boy.

598
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,496
So long, old fellow.

599
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:27,069
Well, you never can tell
when a pal's gonna turn you down.

600
00:51:27,142 --> 00:51:29,406
No, you never can.

601
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,710
Give me a cigarette, will you?

602
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:37,775
No.

603
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:45,458
Well, that's that.

604
00:51:48,464 --> 00:51:51,558
Wait a minute!

605
00:51:51,634 --> 00:51:54,262
I got something to settle with you
before I go up the river.

606
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:56,361
Well, make it snappy, will ya?
I've got a date.

607
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:58,668
- The date'll have to wait.
- Not if I can help it.

608
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,675
Maybe you can't.

609
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:03,507
You ratted, didn't you?

610
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:08,206
What if I did?

611
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,218
You're so smart,
aren't you, Mr. Big Shot?

612
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:17,487
Well, when you'll be doing a stretch,
I'll be running around uptown...

613
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:19,618
doing plenty good for myself.

614
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:25,031
I don't need you anymore.
I was all washed up with you anyway.

615
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,092
I ain't goin' away leavin' a rat
runnin' around loose.

616
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,604
Just try and stop me.

617
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:33,665
And give my regards to the warden.

618
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:49,283
Go on.
Get in there.

619
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:02,160
Go on. Get in there,
you guys. Go on!

620
00:53:03,872 --> 00:53:05,863
All right, Big, quick.

621
00:53:13,949 --> 00:53:17,282
You didn't have to do that.
You go in too quick for that stuff.

622
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:20,982
I told you 20 times
you don't have to croak nobody.

623
00:53:21,056 --> 00:53:24,321
It was comin' to him.
He didn't keep his nose clean.

624
00:53:24,393 --> 00:53:27,191
Aw, I always liked that guy...

625
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:30,823
ever since we was kids.

626
00:53:30,899 --> 00:53:34,130
- You didn't have to do that.
- I liked him too, Louis.

627
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:39,106
But you know what's got to happen to a guy
when he doesn't keep his nose clean.

628
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,699
Come on.
Let's go up and see Mama.

629
00:53:49,418 --> 00:53:51,852
<i>- Hello, "mamina." How are you?
- Ooh.!</i>

630
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,014
<i>Look who I brought here to see ya.</i>

631
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,718
Hello, my baby. How are ya?
Look who's here.

632
00:53:57,793 --> 00:54:02,127
- Hiya, Pop.
- Come on. Sit down here by the fire.

633
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,392
How are you?
Sit down, okay?

634
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:09,165
- Big's leaving town tomorrow for his health.
- Huh?

635
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:12,139
Your health not good?

636
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,405
The "rheumatiz," huh?
You know what's good for him?

637
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:19,208
You take the raw potato...

638
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,476
<i>and put him in the back pocket.</i>

639
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,179
<i>In one month,
the rheumatiz, she's gone...</i>

640
00:54:25,254 --> 00:54:27,518
<i>and the potato, she's a rock.</i>

641
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:32,125
Tell me, Big.
Not the- cough?

642
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:36,324
Wait a minute.
I got just what you need.

643
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,798
Oh, I'll be all right, Pop.

644
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:45,396
- Too long I don't see you, "mamina."
- Oh.

645
00:54:45,474 --> 00:54:48,966
Too busy to kissing the hand
of the young girls.

646
00:54:49,044 --> 00:54:51,604
- So you now kissing my hand.
- No, "mamina."

647
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,342
- No.
- What time is it, Ma?

648
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,782
Why, it's...

649
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:58,786
9:15.

650
00:54:58,854 --> 00:55:02,346
- I thought it was more than that.
- Ah, here it is.

651
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,790
I got just the good thing
for the cough.

652
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,126
<i>Grease of the goose.</i>

653
00:55:09,198 --> 00:55:11,428
<i>I'll be all right, Pop.</i>

654
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,900
<i>"Be all right. All right."
Everybody say "All right."</i>

655
00:55:13,969 --> 00:55:16,267
<i>Then they cough-</i>

656
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:17,965
<i>Then by and by, the croup come in.</i>

657
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,908
You guys'll be here when I get back?

658
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:24,775
Sure.

659
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:28,647
Yeah. That's what I thought.

660
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:35,054
Didn't I see you two fellas
at the Yale-Princeton game?

661
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,148
No!

662
00:55:37,226 --> 00:55:39,490
I thought I recognized the coats.

663
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:42,029
Hello, Louis.

664
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:44,190
<i>- Hello, Good News. How are you?
- Hello.</i>

665
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:47,497
- Have an apple.
- No, thanks. How are ya, Mrs. Beretti?

666
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:51,198
- Just dropped in to see the old folks.
- A cigar.

667
00:55:51,273 --> 00:55:53,207
- A cigar, Mr. Brophy.
- Oh, thanks.

668
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:55,607
- One of Pop's best.
- You don't smoke 'em, do you?

669
00:55:55,677 --> 00:55:59,374
You think I'm crazy?
Well, Good News, what's the big idea?

670
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:02,417
Oh, just passing by.
Just passing by.

671
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,044
- Good.
- You fellas been here long?

672
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,020
Oh, a half,
three quarters of an hour.

673
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:09,387
What time did they come in,
Mrs. Beretti?

674
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:12,484
<i>- A quarter past 9:00.
- A quarter past 9:00?</i>

675
00:56:12,561 --> 00:56:14,654
<i>- Sure.
- Are you sure?</i>

676
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,994
Oh, sure I'm sure.

677
00:56:17,065 --> 00:56:21,092
Didn't Luigi ask me the time,
and didn't I look at the clock?

678
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,228
<i>Sure, I'm sure.</i>

679
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,273
He asked you, did he?

680
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,468
You guys are gettin' to be
a couple of champion clock watchers.

681
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:31,479
- Well, what's the difference?
- Hello, Rose.

682
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:33,481
Hello, Mr. Brophy.

683
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:39,447
Hey, uh, we were just leavin'.

684
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,853
- Goin' our way?
- Yeah, sure.

685
00:56:43,892 --> 00:56:45,883
Good-bye, Rose.

686
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:02,643
What's the good news
this time, Brophy?

687
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,236
Well, I got a shock for you guys.

688
00:57:05,314 --> 00:57:09,910
Ritzy Reilly was plugged a few minutes ago...
in the back.

689
00:57:09,985 --> 00:57:12,419
No!

690
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:14,717
Gee.

691
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,385
- He was my pal.
- Bumped off? That's tough.

692
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,621
One of the old mob too.

693
00:57:20,696 --> 00:57:23,324
According to the clock
and Ma Beretti...

694
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,629
you guys were upstairs
when Ritzy was killed.

695
00:57:26,702 --> 00:57:29,865
You know, someday,
you're gonna run out of alibis.

696
00:57:29,938 --> 00:57:33,237
- Well, you don't ever think that I'd-
- You'd do anything.

697
00:57:33,308 --> 00:57:36,835
But you're different, Louis.
Why, you got a great war record.

698
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,574
Your joint uptown,
it's making plenty of dough.

699
00:57:39,648 --> 00:57:44,278
Why don't you shake this mob before they get you
in a jam that'll mean the chair?

700
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:47,516
I'm all through with that,
Good News.

701
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:52,526
Except Big. I'll never ditch a guy
I've been pals with all my life...

702
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,528
that I went to school with.

703
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:58,362
Ritzy went to school with him too, didn't he?
So did I.

704
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:03,496
You can't beat old John Law,
Louis, all your life.

705
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:05,733
Think that over.

706
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:08,833
He'll have plenty of time
to do his thinking...

707
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:11,071
up the river.

708
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:25,550
- How's the old lady, Louis? Okay?

709
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,596
Aw, she's great.
Say, we're havin' supper with her tonight.

710
00:58:28,664 --> 00:58:33,431
You know that, don't you? Spaghetti,
plenty of vino.

711
00:58:33,502 --> 00:58:37,097
Hey, now, don't forget.
You just come back from the old country.

712
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:40,767
Yeah, my granite castle
on the river.

713
00:58:40,842 --> 00:58:42,969
- Tough joint?
- I've been in easier.

714
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:46,071
But they won't put me in there again.
They'll bump me off first.

715
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,013
- Aw, it's a sucker's game, Big.

716
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:50,711
You can't beat it.

717
00:58:50,786 --> 00:58:55,621
Now, I'm makin' a lot of dough. Why don't you
come over to my joint and take a cut?

718
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:59,058
Nah. You stick to your racket, Louis.
I'll stick to mine.

719
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:02,722
You ain't got a chance, Big.
Good News is on the gang's tail every minute.

720
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,325
- They can't move.
- Brophy'll never lay a finger on 'em again.

721
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:10,030
What they need is a leader,
and I'm plannin' somethin' big for 'em.

722
00:59:10,105 --> 00:59:13,768
- Very big.
- Okay.

723
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:16,538
But you're welcome to come in with me
at any time.

724
00:59:16,611 --> 00:59:18,806
- You know that, don't you?
- I know it, Louis.

725
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,871
Thanks.

726
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:43,329
<i>Tough on the mother, all right.</i>

727
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:46,704
Yeggs that do a thing like that
oughta be lynched.

728
00:59:46,775 --> 00:59:48,709
Stealin' a kid.

729
00:59:48,777 --> 00:59:51,337
I'm a peaceful man...

730
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:54,610
but I wouldn't mind
helping string them up myself.

731
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:08,559
Beacon-4000.
Give me a quick shot, will you, Needle?

732
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,928
- Louis's bottle.
- Okay.

733
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:14,093
City desk.

734
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:17,468
O'Brien talking.
Listen, I got a lead on that lost society baby.

735
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:20,633
Yeah, I trailed a car
down to Jamaica Bay.

736
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:23,143
You know, those low marshlands.

737
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:26,738
Oh, sure, you do,
where all those fishing boathouses are.

738
01:00:26,815 --> 01:00:30,615
I tipped off the local cops.
They're spreadin' a net around.

739
01:00:30,685 --> 01:00:33,279
- So long, Louis.
- So long, Big.

740
01:00:33,355 --> 01:00:35,289
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Okay.

741
01:00:35,357 --> 01:00:37,325
Nothing will break on it
before morning.

742
01:00:37,392 --> 01:00:40,190
No, this isn't a hunch.
It's a real lead.

743
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,526
I'm gonna stay on it all night.

744
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:47,864
Well, I'm in a drugstore
in Jamaica right now.

745
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,269
Call me back
if you don't believe me.

746
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:53,307
Good night.

747
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,708
- Sounds like you got a big story there, Bill.
- I have.

748
01:00:58,013 --> 01:01:00,811
- Seen the duke lately, Louis?
- Say, listen.

749
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:03,578
If I see that duke again,
I'll punch him in the nose.

750
01:01:03,652 --> 01:01:06,553
There was a dame
around here a little while ago.

751
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,089
Heard she was a duchess.
She was raisin' the dickens.

752
01:01:09,157 --> 01:01:11,489
<i>Hey, boss, your sister is out here...</i>

753
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,051
<i>and she wants to see you right away.</i>

754
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,063
<i>- Rosa?
- Yeah.</i>

755
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,294
<i>- What's wrong?
- I don't know.</i>

756
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:22,165
<i>- Wait here for me, Bill.
- Sure.</i>

757
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:25,260
<i>Louis.!</i>

758
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:27,799
Hey, what's the matter, Rosa?
What's-

759
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:31,667
Joan. Hey, what's this all about?

760
01:01:31,737 --> 01:01:34,365
Oh, Louis, it's so terrible.
Poor Mrs. Milburn.

761
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,374
Her baby!

762
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:41,004
- Nobody but a beast could-
- Now, take it easy, kid. Take it easy.

763
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,947
- What's wrong, Joan?
- Oh, Louis, my baby's gone.

764
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:45,950
Stolen!

765
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:48,714
- Your-Your baby?
- Louis, l-

766
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,779
You mean that little-

767
01:01:53,993 --> 01:01:56,587
- So that's what they was talking about.
- Oh, Louis, I'm frantic.

768
01:01:56,662 --> 01:01:59,859
Dick's still in Europe.
The police tell me to wait, wait.

769
01:01:59,932 --> 01:02:02,457
My baby's gone.
How can I wait, Louis?

770
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:06,471
Once you told me if I ever needed anyone
to help me, to come to you.

771
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:08,871
Well, Louis, I need you now.

772
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:11,409
Sure. Sure, Joan.
I'll help you. I'll help you.

773
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:16,744
I thought you might-
you might know people who could tell you.

774
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,582
I don't care what it costs.
Anything. Anything!

775
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,985
Ah, now, don't worry.
It'll be all right, I tell ya.

776
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:24,989
- It's gonna be all right.
- Thank you.

777
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:28,151
- Take her up to my office. Now, don't worry.
- I knew you'd do it.

778
01:02:28,227 --> 01:02:31,993
It's a cinch. It'll be all right.
Sure, sure.

779
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:57,514
Give me that gat, Joe.
Give me that gat!

780
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,054
Bill, I want you
to take me down to Jamaica.

781
01:03:02,128 --> 01:03:04,494
You know, that place
you tailed that car to.

782
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:07,089
Wait a minute, Louis.
I didn't tell my city editor everything...

783
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:09,100
but I'm gonna tell you.

784
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:12,228
It may make a difference.
You might wanna keep out of this.

785
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:15,240
Huh?
What do you mean?

786
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:19,642
That car that I trailed to Jamaica,
I followed it back here...

787
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,839
right out to the front door.

788
01:03:21,914 --> 01:03:27,250
It was Joe’s hack.
Joe was the guy that was driving it.

789
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,756
Stay out of this, Louis.
Don't be a chump and get yourself jammed up.

790
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:32,814
You're doin' all right now.

791
01:03:34,827 --> 01:03:38,422
Give me an extra clip.
Give me an extra clip!

792
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,194
Come on, Bill.

793
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:46,568
Hey, Needle, give me a pint of scotch, will ya?
I may need it.

794
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:49,665
Hurry.

795
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:51,733
Right off the ship.

796
01:04:26,812 --> 01:04:29,440
Hey, Bill. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

797
01:04:29,515 --> 01:04:31,449
- Watch yourself, Louis.
- Okay.

798
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,901
Stick 'em up!

799
01:06:05,978 --> 01:06:07,969
Louis.

800
01:06:09,815 --> 01:06:12,943
Good mornin', Sir Maurice.

801
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:16,351
So this is the place you were gonna bring
that dame to, huh?

802
01:06:16,422 --> 01:06:18,356
Your country estate.

803
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:20,585
Oh, I say, Louis, don't rag a chap.

804
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:23,287
Look, you know what women are.

805
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:25,296
What the heck-

806
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:29,460
Oh, it's just-just-just a doll I've been making
for the nipper.

807
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:33,665
What are you doin' down here, Louis?

808
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,936
Me? Plenty.

809
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:43,344
A couple of fine rats
you guys turned out to be.

810
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,646
Stealin' a kid!

811
01:06:45,718 --> 01:06:48,551
Why didn't you come to me
if you was broke...

812
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:52,682
instead of pullin'
a lousy trick like this?

813
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,919
We couldn't help it, Louis.
I told Big-

814
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:57,622
Aw, shut up!

815
01:06:57,696 --> 01:07:00,256
Where's the kid now?

816
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:02,800
- Is she okay?
- Oh, sure. She's asleep.

817
01:07:02,868 --> 01:07:04,859
Go get her.

818
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:09,902
- Does Big know that you're comin' down here?
- Shut up!

819
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:13,672
Careful now.

820
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:16,078
All right.
Take her outside and give her to O'Brien.

821
01:07:16,148 --> 01:07:19,777
- He's waitin' out there.
- Please let me go home. I wanna see Mommy.

822
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:25,290
Sure, sure, kid.
You're goin' right home to your mama now.

823
01:07:25,357 --> 01:07:28,554
All right,
now I'm gonna let you guys go clear.

824
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,687
But I oughta put a couple of slugs
into both of ya.

825
01:07:31,764 --> 01:07:35,325
So don't try to pull anything.
Get me?

826
01:07:35,401 --> 01:07:37,392
All right, get out.

827
01:07:39,038 --> 01:07:42,303
Look out, Louis, for Joe.

828
01:07:42,374 --> 01:07:46,071
Hey, Bill,
take the kid from these rats.

829
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,136
Okay, Louis.

830
01:08:05,464 --> 01:08:08,058
- Come on out of there, Joe.

831
01:08:12,404 --> 01:08:17,273
I can see it was you
who promoted this lousy trick.

832
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:21,006
It would take a yellowbelly
like you to think of it.

833
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:26,882
Well, the kid's gone.
You can't get her back without finishing me...

834
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:29,011
and you ain't got
the guts to do that.

835
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:31,454
- I ain't, huh?
- No, you ain't.

836
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:35,392
Well, I had enough guts to bump off
that four-eyed husband of Rosa's, didn't I?

837
01:08:35,461 --> 01:08:39,727
- You did that?
- Yeah, I did it, and I got
enough guts to bump you off too!

838
01:08:39,798 --> 01:08:43,495
Think you're pretty swell, huh? Givin' up
your own mob because you got a new-

839
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,715
Hello?

840
01:09:07,793 --> 01:09:10,261
Hello?

841
01:09:10,329 --> 01:09:13,162
Oh, hello, Big.

842
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,666
Sure.

843
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:19,295
Everything's okay here.

844
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:21,931
The kid's gone back...

845
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:24,874
to her mother.

846
01:09:24,944 --> 01:09:27,538
I sent her.

847
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:30,480
Yeah.

848
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:33,074
Louis.

849
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:35,518
Louis Beretti.

850
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:40,855
So you couldn't keep
your nose clean.

851
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:45,659
I'll be waiting for you...
at your joint.

852
01:10:17,262 --> 01:10:20,595
- Hello, Joe.
- How are ya?

853
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:23,294
You're stayin' up
pretty late, ain't ya?

854
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:26,270
Waitin' for Louis
to take the damper.

855
01:10:33,445 --> 01:10:36,107
No, you'd better
give me some seltzer.

856
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:38,115
Okay.

857
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:45,315
Well, I think I'll beat it, Needle.

858
01:10:45,391 --> 01:10:47,552
- Okay?
- Go ahead.

859
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:50,390
<i>Good night.</i>

860
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:52,896
<i>- Good night, Big.
- Good night.</i>

861
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:54,956
Good night.

862
01:11:22,394 --> 01:11:26,797
<i>- Any news in the paper, Joe?
- Lots of news.</i>

863
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:17,037
- Hello, Louis.
- Hello, Big.

864
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,822
Out kind of early, ain't ya?

865
01:12:25,891 --> 01:12:29,725
Yeah. You too.

866
01:12:29,795 --> 01:12:31,990
Yeah.

867
01:12:32,064 --> 01:12:35,124
What's on your mind, Big?

868
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,191
I guess you know.

869
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:43,406
Yeah.

870
01:12:43,475 --> 01:12:46,239
How's your old lady, Louis?

871
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:49,144
It's been a long time
since I seen her.

872
01:12:49,214 --> 01:12:51,774
Too long, I guess.

873
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,080
She's okay.

874
01:12:54,153 --> 01:12:57,316
She always did a guy good.

875
01:12:57,389 --> 01:12:59,619
Yeah.

876
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:02,319
She's been just like a mother to me.

877
01:13:02,394 --> 01:13:05,090
The only one I ever knew.

878
01:13:05,164 --> 01:13:07,189
Sure.

879
01:13:07,266 --> 01:13:11,066
I remember when
we was kids together.

880
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:14,196
The time I got
that slug in the shoulder.

881
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:18,534
All the other kids run away.

882
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,771
Yeah.

883
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:24,213
It was you who took me
to the hospital.

884
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:28,714
You used to be a good guy, Louis.

885
01:13:30,589 --> 01:13:34,355
Yeah.
It's tough.

886
01:13:34,426 --> 01:13:38,556
Too bad you couldn't
keep your nose clean.

887
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,564
Yeah.

888
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:42,793
Too bad.

889
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:45,132
I'm tired, Louis.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

890
01:13:45,204 --> 01:13:48,833
- So long, Louis.
- Okay.

891
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:50,932
So long, Big.

892
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,876
- So long, Joe.
- So long, Joe.

893
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:33,650
Did he get you, Louis, bad?

894
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:37,553
I'm okay.
You'd better phone Brophy.

895
01:14:37,623 --> 01:14:41,184
<i>- He'll wanna talk to me about this.
- Hello, Louis.</i>

896
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,252
Hello, Bill.
Where's the kid?

897
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,991
Safe and sound,
back with its mother.

898
01:14:49,935 --> 01:14:51,960
What's wrong with you, Louis?

899
01:14:52,037 --> 01:14:53,971
Nothin', nothin'.

900
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:57,941
You've been plugged.
Who did it?

901
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:00,478
A guy who-

902
01:15:00,545 --> 01:15:04,572
who didn't think
I kept my nose clean.

903
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:08,313
But he-
he never knew what it-

904
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:11,220
what it really meant.

905
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,315
L-

906
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:16,054
I just found out...

907
01:15:16,128 --> 01:15:18,119
myself.

908
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:24,158
I think I'll go home.

909
01:15:27,973 --> 01:15:30,237
He'll be all right.
Get him a drink, quick. Hustle!

910
01:15:30,309 --> 01:15:32,800
Get me one too.

911
01:15:32,878 --> 01:15:36,439
Hey, Joe?
Louis's bottle.
