1
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:00,171
Close it.

2
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:47,213
It's not much, I know,
but there was nothing better.

3
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:51,171
People never die when you
need them, right doctor?

4
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:56,796
- It's an honour, Baron.
- There's no need to count it, it's 50.

5
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,505
Yes, of course.
When's the next one?

6
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:04,005
Lynch, I'll need you next week
for something special.

7
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:08,921
Sounds good to me,
that means lots of money.

8
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,921
I need a corpse no more
than six hours old.

9
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,671
- 200.
- 500.

10
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,380
- 300.
- Fine.

11
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,046
I don't mind doing my bit for science.

12
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,838
- But I can't promise.
- Results Lynch, not promises.

13
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,380
I don't understand why
you trust him so much.

14
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,338
Money, Charles. It's a wonderful
drug for people like Lynch.

15
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,630
Perhaps it's nothing more
than a splendid dream.

16
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:57,255
Or perhaps,
just an insane nightmare.

17
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,963
- Does it matter?
- N0, not if I give him life.

18
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,880
It's worth every risk.
Any risk...

19
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,921
- Even your life?
- Yes, of course.

20
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:11,255
The creation of life is the
greatest achievement.

21
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:13,130
To hesitate or have doubts...

22
00:05:14,046 --> 00:05:16,005
to be scared now...

23
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:20,421
would mean all my work
up to now has been pointless.

24
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,296
This... is my life.

25
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,713
But creating life,
isn't that God's task alone?

26
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,880
Here on earth, man is God.

27
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,630
G0 to bed, Charles.

28
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,213
Tanya arrives tomorrow,
get some rest.

29
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:44,046
Goodnight.

30
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,546
Goodnight.

31
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:54,255
What will you tell her?

32
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,088
Nothing.

33
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,713
But we must finish our work
immediately, don't you agree?

34
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:03,796
Yes, it's true.

35
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,630
Charles!

36
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,255
You're not saying hello?
I think I at least deserve that.

37
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,213
Forgive me, Tanya.

38
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:26,921
Forgive me, I'm confused.

39
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,088
Your father and I are happy
to have you with us.

40
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:30,338
- Come.
- Thank you.

41
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,463
Thomas.

42
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,338
Come here, Thomas.

43
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,588
Come, Thomas.

44
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:46,171
Take the lady's luggage
and bring it to her room.

45
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:49,005
From the carriage you'll
take it to her room.

46
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,005
Is that understood?
G0.

47
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Poor Thomas, he's a good lad.
Except for his brain, he's quite normal.

48
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:11,588
It must have been a childhood illness.

49
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:24,671
- What a pity, such a handsome boy.
- Your father's getting dressed.

50
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:28,005
- He worked until late last night.
- As usual.

51
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:31,838
Is he still working on his animal
transplant experiments?

52
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,630
You know what he's like, he's been
working on them for twenty years...

53
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:37,630
and he'll work on them for
another twenty, and he'll continue.

54
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:39,588
Tell me about university.

55
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:43,130
Except for my studies,
it was rather boring...

56
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,088
but I didn't go there
for the social life.

57
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:46,796
Aren't you happy?

58
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:51,713
I'm like my father, stubborn.
When I want something, I get it.

59
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:56,796
And that's what happened, top of the
class, and now I'm a surgery graduate.

60
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,880
My compliments, doctor.

61
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,838
Daddy!

62
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:06,213
- My girl.
- It's great to see you again.

63
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,296
That's enough, is this the way
a surgery graduate behaves?

64
00:08:12,296 --> 00:08:13,421
Yes, it is.

65
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:19,755
Yes, Jack Morgan.
Poor son of a bitch, they'll hang him.

66
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:22,213
They'll break his neck today.

67
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,630
Are you and Harry with me?

68
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,005
Poor son of a bitch that Jack
Morgan, I never liked him.

69
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,463
- Or you, right?
- Yes, sure, but I'm waiting.

70
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,046
- We can't do it any earlier.
- And Harry?

71
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:38,255
- He goes where I go.
- Perfect, to Jack Morgan.

72
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:40,130
To his death.

73
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:45,255
And when professor Muller wanted
to object to my theory...

74
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:48,755
I stood there like Sir Galahad
in front of the dragon.

75
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:51,713
Professor Muller was very much
the dragon, I assure you.

76
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,046
My colleagues retired to their places
thinking who knows what?

77
00:08:57,046 --> 00:09:01,505
And I told that dumb intellectual
how narrow-minded his views were.

78
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:07,963
Professor, it's men like you,
with the imagination of an ostrich...

79
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:11,171
that bury their heads under
the sand of superstition.

80
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:16,171
Whenever someone comes along with a new idea,
they keep it under lock and key.

81
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:19,838
It's medicine ancl science in the
laboratory of the archivist.

82
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,130
Then I said, I won't set foot in your
class until you apologise...

83
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,671
for your entirely subjective
ancl insulting criticisms.

84
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,588
Good clay, Professor.
And I left.

85
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,713
I know, you've heard it a million times.

86
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,088
It doesn't matter.

87
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:42,255
It's a fascinating story.

88
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:47,421
You know, the Frankenstein name
still echoes around the university.

89
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:52,588
I'm not surprised, I haven't cared about
what those idiots think about me...

90
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:55,171
or my theories since I left them.

91
00:09:57,171 --> 00:10:01,671
- Sit down Charles, your leg must be tired.
- N0, thank you, I'm fine.

92
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:02,630
Thank you.

93
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:08,713
Did you have any problems at university
because you were my daughter?

94
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,463
Sometimes.

95
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,338
But mainly because I was a woman.

96
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,546
Sadly, the professors still have their
prejudices about a woman's role.

97
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,463
- You'll be an excellent surgeon.
- Thank you, Charles.

98
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:24,671
But I don't just want to be
an excellent surgeon.

99
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,213
What do you want to do?

100
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,338
Assist you father, in your work.

101
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,255
Since I was a child, I've always been
interested in your experiments.

102
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,921
Every summer when I came here...

103
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,671
I went into your laboratory.

104
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:44,838
It was always locked.

105
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:48,713
Of course, but I found a way in.

106
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:51,963
A tunnel, in the wall in your room.

107
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:56,921
I wonder how you managed to find it.

108
00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:59,255
I was very curious.

109
00:11:00,963 --> 00:11:06,421
Now as well, I'm curious to know
what progress you've made.

110
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:09,963
I hope you won't keep any
secrets from me now.

111
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,505
I'll be very glad to discuss it,
doctor to doctor.

112
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:18,005
Good.

113
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:22,880
But I must confess that my
ideas are radical.

114
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,463
Much more than yours, father.

115
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:27,505
ReaHy?

116
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:31,880
Of course, I'm my father's daughter.

117
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:36,588
You're talking about the
transplant experiments on animals?

118
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:39,213
On men.

119
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:07,255
Thomas.

120
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,421
Easy, 685V!

121
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,255
You frightened me, Thomas.

122
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,505
It doesn't matter.

123
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:24,421
Does it have a name?

124
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,755
- What do you call it?
- N0 name, no.

125
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,421
D0 you like my father?

126
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,546
My father, the Baron,
do you like him?

127
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:45,005
Even when he takes your animals away?
Even then?

128
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,838
Your animals, do you feel very
sad when the Baron uses them?

129
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:57,713
- N0, not you.
- N0, not me! The Baron.

130
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:00,713
Does it upset you when he
takes your lambs?

131
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,713
No, he doesn't take them!

132
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,421
What is it?

133
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:09,713
Why are you scared of him?

134
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:12,463
Is he bad?

135
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:14,296
Bad.

136
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:21,505
- Did he do something to you?
- Bad.

137
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:26,088
- Why another £300?
- This is a delicate matter.

138
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,921
There are people who must
be paid in advance.

139
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:34,755
- Which people?
- Listen, Baron.

140
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,255
I can't say.

141
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,588
Professional ethics.

142
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,088
Don't talk about ethics.

143
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:44,046
I can get one but it will cost
you another £300.

144
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:49,421
The way things stand,
you don't have any other choice.

145
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,921
- I'll try to find it.
- Take your time, and don't worry...

146
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:59,671
I won't sit down, I wouldn't want
to ruin your lovely furniture.

147
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:08,380
Excuse me.

148
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,213
I was looking for my father.

149
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:16,171
- Would that be Doctor Marshall?
- No, the Baron.

150
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:20,130
I never thought the Baron
had it in him.

151
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,421
And Doctor Marshall does?

152
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:26,088
No, he'd have no hope!

153
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:29,046
- Something to drink?
- No, it's too early.

154
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,963
It's never too early,
for anything.

155
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:35,963
What are you doing here?

156
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:40,380
You're a detestable man,
extremely vulgar...

157
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,546
and I'm sure whatever
you're thinking is pure fantasy.

158
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:49,213
I'd say you spend too much time alone.

159
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:54,755
Be careful, that will rot
your brain faster than whiskey.

160
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:59,921
How could a person like you
think like a witch?

161
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,296
It depends on the company
I find myself in.

162
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:06,171
Excuse me, father.

163
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:10,380
I'm sorry, I didn't realise
you were there.

164
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,505
Mr Lynch.

165
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,588
Come, I'll show you out.

166
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,630
It was a real pleasure speaking to you.
Good clay.

167
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,130
Father.

168
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,921
- I said I'm sorry.
- I heard you.

169
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:42,880
£200 now,
another 200 on delivery.

170
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,713
- When will it be?
- Very soon.

171
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:48,296
- When?
- When they hang Jack Morgan.

172
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,880
- The clay after tomorrow.
- And then?

173
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:51,880
Then he's all yours.

174
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:00,505
Murderer!

175
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:04,630
Murderer!
You'll pay for your sins!

176
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:09,546
"I come to bury Caesar,
not to praise him."

177
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,046
Murderer!

178
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,880
You'll rot in Hell!

179
00:16:16,963 --> 00:16:18,630
Murderer!

180
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,838
Murderer!

181
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:27,338
I'm guessing you're not going
to miss Jack Morgan.

182
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,713
Just like I won't miss you, Captain.

183
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:33,380
I find that most depressing, Lynch.

184
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,005
Because one clay you'll find yourself
shaking Morgan's hand in Hell.

185
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,630
You mean I'll keep
the other hand for you?

186
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,505
Your clays are numbered.

187
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:47,130
You'll slip up soon,
and that will be the clay I pay my debt.

188
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:51,921
N0, not prison my friend,
you're too smart for that.

189
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,880
It's the noose for you.

190
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:59,213
And I'll make sure you get it,
it's the least I can do.

191
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:02,171
You might, you might not.

192
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,171
I'll make sure.

193
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:06,713
I'll make sure, Lynch.

194
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,880
What are you doing here?

195
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:42,588
I was heading for the city
when I saw the crowd.

196
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:47,338
- What's going on?
- Something I'd rather you didn't see.

197
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:48,463
A hanging-

198
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,713
- I've never seen a hanging.
- Nor will you see this one.

199
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:56,630
Come on, I may be a woman
but above all I'm a doctor.

200
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,838
- Death is normal to me.
- This isn't death.

201
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,463
This is legalised murder.

202
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,338
Perhaps she should stay
to see the difference.

203
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,338
Yes, you're right Charles.

204
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:12,963
- Thank you, Charles.
- Don't thank him yet.

205
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:35,338
- Who is that?
- I don't know, I could find out.

206
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:37,421
It isn't necessary.

207
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:46,338
Are you ready?
It's easy now, just a few steps.

208
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:54,005
"And Jesus of Nazareth spoke..."

209
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,630
"Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do."

210
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,005
"And they cast lots to divide
his garments."

211
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,505
It's time, Morgan.

212
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Proceed.

213
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:17,213
One... tw0.. three...

214
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,421
They're coming.

215
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:39,880
- Tanya knows about the animals.
- But how?

216
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,755
I don't know, she asked me
why you still keep them.

217
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,213
Tanya must not find
out about the experiments.

218
00:19:47,213 --> 00:19:48,838
Not now, Charles.

219
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,963
Very good, Lynch.
Excellent.

220
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:02,546
Thank you.
Charles...

221
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:06,130
Come on Turner,
earn your money.

222
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,588
Was it difficult?

223
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,838
As difficult as opening
a bottle of whiskey.

224
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:22,963
D0 you trust him?

225
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,088
I don't trust anyone.

226
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:29,838
Especially a man who drinks.
Don't worry Baron...

227
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:33,880
No one's going to shed a tear over
Jack Morgan's empty grave.

228
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,755
He killed the only person who would
have said a prayer for him.

229
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,088
And next week,
another special commission?

230
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:44,546
I don't know.
I may not need you anymore.

231
00:20:45,088 --> 00:20:48,421
I'm sad to hear that.
I like your money.

232
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,880
- What will I do without it?
- You'll think of something.

233
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,046
I'm not so sure.

234
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:23,005
- How much blood?
- Two pints this time.

235
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:18,713
Good, we're ready.

236
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:27,171
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't...

237
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,796
I really hoped you wouldn't come.

238
00:22:30,921 --> 00:22:34,088
That's why you don't use
animals anymore.

239
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:37,046
Human transplants.

240
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:41,213
Tanya, please go.

241
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:47,630
- I can help you.
- You wouldn't understand.

242
00:22:48,838 --> 00:22:50,088
Yes, father.

243
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,671
YGS.

244
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:55,380
What are you going to do
with the brain?

245
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:57,713
Tanya, please.

246
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:05,671
Will you stop treating me like a child?

247
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:09,796
I'm a doctor, a surgeon.

248
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:12,213
Don't you understand,
I'm just like you?

249
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:17,505
N0.

250
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,588
That's impossible.

251
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:43,505
- Charles?
- It isn't impossible, Tanya.

252
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:50,546
But his heart and brain?
You have to keep them alive.

253
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:53,171
Of course, we've clone it before.

254
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,796
Inside another human body?

255
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:58,213
We don't need a body.

256
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:08,296
You're about to put Morgan's brain
and heart in that creature.

257
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,713
Tanya, no more questions.

258
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,421
N0, I don't want you involved
in this experiment.

259
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:17,421
If anything were to happen,
you'd be as guilty as me in the eyes of the law...

260
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,755
and I couldn't have that.

261
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:24,171
Soon I'll tell you everything.
Just have a little patience.

262
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,505
I'll try.

263
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,005
Good luck.

264
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:38,963
- Everything ready?
- Ready.

265
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:11,671
Pliers.

266
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,005
Pliers.

267
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,296
Start the timer, hurry.

268
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,130
We can begin.

269
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:55,463
It's moving.

270
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:09,046
I hope Morgan's brain
works just as well.

271
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,921
Let's hope so, Charles.

272
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:27,588
Ancl so, for almost twenty years
my animal transplant experiments...

273
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:29,838
have been leading up to this moment.

274
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:33,838
All the humiliations I received
from my colleagues.

275
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:37,213
The accusations against my
mental faculties, all the insults...

276
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:39,963
will be thrown right back
at their idiotic faces.

277
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:43,005
- Looking for something?
- Yes, clouds.

278
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:46,671
I need a storm for the final phase,
a magnetic storm.

279
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:50,130
Only lightning can give life
to the creature.

280
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:54,796
That's why I still haven't
transplanted the heart or the brain.

281
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:58,838
I can keep them alive indefinitely,
but once they're transplanted...

282
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:02,921
they won't last more than a few hours
if they're not activated by lightning.

283
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:05,963
- I want to see how you keep them alive.
- You will.

284
00:28:07,338 --> 00:28:11,421
- You'll do it.
- I won't fail Tanya, I promise.

285
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:15,630
You should be proud of me,
we'll have the medical world at our feet.

286
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,380
I want this so much for you,
to see you realise your dream.

287
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,338
Something nobody can ever
take away from you.

288
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:25,546
There won't be any need,
I'll be glad to share it.

289
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:32,171
It's time.

290
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:48,630
Charles! Charles!

291
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,338
The brain, Charles.

292
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:06,505
Doctor, quick.

293
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,046
Below the cortex.

294
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:20,213
- In the white matter?
- No, lower, in the grey matter.

295
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:23,880
Look.
A lesion on the hypothalamus.

296
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,588
It's no good, we can't use it.

297
00:30:31,755 --> 00:30:34,838
It won't work.
We need to find another one.

298
00:30:36,713 --> 00:30:39,421
- There's no time.
- We must find the time.

299
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,046
We can't use a lesioned brain.

300
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:44,963
But the lesion might be insignificant.

301
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,380
And if it isn't?

302
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:50,588
The hypothalamus controls
the central nervous system.

303
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:54,921
It could paralyse an organ,
and then what benefit would there be?

304
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:58,713
To give him life and then leave
him paralysed like a corpse.

305
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:02,380
- It's a risk we must face.
- What about anger and pleasure?

306
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,255
The two emotions connected
to the lesioned part of the brain.

307
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:06,671
Two vital emotions.

308
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:09,796
One of the two in excess
would be disastrous.

309
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:13,296
- We must find another brain!
- I don't have time.

310
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,046
Every minute shortens
the life of that heart.

311
00:31:16,046 --> 00:31:19,088
I can't throw away twenty years
of work in a few minutes.

312
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:22,713
- I'm begging you, think!
- Think?

313
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:26,005
No, it's instinct that changes
the world, not thoughts...

314
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:29,380
and my instinct is telling me to
transplant this brain immediately!

315
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:31,796
And I'll do it alone.

316
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:36,921
- I'm with you.
- Thank you, Charles.

317
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:41,880
The skylight.

318
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,713
Raise the platform.

319
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:17,755
We'll wait for the storm
to get stronger, Charles.

320
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,755
Man's will is clone.

321
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:57,296
He's electrified.

322
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:22,588
Curses!

323
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:44,963
Charles, close the skylight.

324
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,421
Close it!

325
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:34,171
Nothing.

326
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,546
- We must wait.
- His face?

327
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:42,546
To hell with it, I don't care what
he looks like as long as he lives.

328
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:04,421
I messed up, Charles.
You were right.

329
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,713
I should have repaired
the lesion on the brain.

330
00:37:07,713 --> 00:37:09,838
It probably wouldn't
have changed anything.

331
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:12,546
The effects of the lesion would
only have been noticeable...

332
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:14,338
if the brain had been reactivated.

333
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:19,421
We'll never know, and not knowing
is more disappointing than failure.

334
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:23,421
Have a long rest,
then we can start again.

335
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,130
No Charles, it's too late.

336
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:28,338
It's too late for me.

337
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:33,755
Perhaps Tanya will take my place.

338
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,463
- Will you help her?
- Of course.

339
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,838
But let's see how you
feel in a couple of months.

340
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,505
- You might change your mind.
- I doubt that very much.

341
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:46,546
I'm not even sure I want Tanya
to attempt the experiment.

342
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:50,671
- A moment ago you asked me to help her.
- Yes, a moment ago I wanted you to.

343
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:55,046
- It was a selfish impulse.
- You mustn't say that.

344
00:37:55,296 --> 00:38:00,671
You see Charles, perhaps there are some
things man should leave to God.

345
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:03,171
I'd never have thought...

346
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:06,671
He's alive!

347
00:38:17,421 --> 00:38:19,296
Yes, he's alive.

348
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:26,546
It's beating.

349
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:28,713
It's beating.

350
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,380
It's beating.

351
00:38:32,463 --> 00:38:33,838
Stand back, Charles.

352
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,380
Now we'll find out if this is
all just a figment of our imagination.

353
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,588
Get up.

354
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:03,963
Come on, get UP!

355
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,630
Come down.

356
00:39:25,505 --> 00:39:26,505
Come down!

357
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:52,380
We've clone it, Charles.
We've clone it!

358
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,380
Go on, Charles.

359
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:58,755
Call Tanya, I want her
to share this moment with us.

360
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,171
Come forward.

361
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:14,796
Take three steps.

362
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,921
Stop there.

363
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,838
Lower your arms.
I order you to lower...

364
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:13,505
Tanya.

365
00:41:14,963 --> 00:41:15,921
Tanya.

366
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,255
He did it.

367
00:41:19,088 --> 00:41:20,171
He's alive!

368
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,671
- He's alive.
- Oh, Charles!

369
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:38,171
How marvellous!

370
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:52,255
- Who is that in the hallway?
- Please, just keep calm.

371
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:53,963
My father!

372
00:42:01,296 --> 00:42:02,963
What happened to my father?

373
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:08,046
Dad!

374
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,921
Tanya.

375
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,630
What do we do now, Charles?

376
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:38,755
We must call the police.

377
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:39,963
N0!

378
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:43,463
- Not yet.
- We must.

379
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:46,296
D0 you want to destroy
my father's reputation?

380
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,505
Of course not, but we can't
hide this from the police.

381
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:53,296
I said no.

382
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:57,671
- You don't understand.
- Tanya...

383
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,755
Listen to me, what will happen
if he kills again, and again?

384
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,838
No, Tanya.
We must tell Harris.

385
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,421
Yes, tell him.

386
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:16,838
- But tell him it was a thief.
- What about Morgan's body?

387
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:22,796
What did you do with the other cadavers?

388
00:43:23,546 --> 00:43:26,171
The acid tank.
It's in the other room.

389
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:29,338
Let's put Morgan in it.

390
00:43:31,963 --> 00:43:34,505
Please Charles, we must hurry.

391
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,796
I don't know.

392
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:40,005
What do you hope to gain?

393
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,088
Time.

394
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:49,421
Time to find a way
to save my father's name.

395
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,796
Charles, didn't you love him?

396
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:56,838
Of course.

397
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,755
D0 it for him.

398
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:03,046
And for me, Charles.

399
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,046
Just for me.

400
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:07,505
Please.

401
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:04,546
- Is this where you found him?
- Yes, exactly where you are now.

402
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:07,088
I SEE.

403
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:10,171
Very interesting.

404
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:30,671
Animal organs, I presume?

405
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:35,296
Of course, my father dedicated
himself to animal organ transplants.

406
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:40,213
Yes, very interesting.
And you saw the thief.

407
00:45:40,463 --> 00:45:41,713
A giant, you said.

408
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,880
He must have been a real giant.
Strong enough to...

409
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,588
- What did he steal?
- Nothing, as far as I know.

410
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:57,421
- I haven't checked everything.
- My father must have surprised him.

411
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,171
I'd say it was your father
who was surprised.

412
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,838
But why would a thief enter
a laboratory?

413
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:06,171
Perhaps he didn't know
it was a laboratory.

414
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:09,546
He must have seen the light on
and came in to look around.

415
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:10,963
Perhaps.

416
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:14,713
A very tall man, you said.

417
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,755
- How tall?
- I don't know, I was asleep.

418
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:22,421
At least a foot taller than you, Captain.

419
00:46:22,838 --> 00:46:26,880
Really? That would
make him around seven foot.

420
00:46:27,963 --> 00:46:29,755
Are you sure, Doctor Marshall?

421
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:33,880
A bit more, a bit less, I was trying
to get away when I saw him.

422
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:37,130
You said you saw him with the Baron.

423
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:42,588
Yes, but all I remember is
that giant crushing the Baron.

424
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,963
I'd left him about an hour earlier.

425
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,046
I was exhausted and I couldn't sleep,
then I heard footsteps outside the door.

426
00:46:51,296 --> 00:46:54,380
It could have been the Baron or Tanya.

427
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,421
No, they came from the stairs
that lead to the laboratory.

428
00:46:57,713 --> 00:47:01,588
The Baron was in the laboratory and
Tanya would never have disturbed him.

429
00:47:02,505 --> 00:47:05,671
S0 it must have been somebody
who was a stranger to the house.

430
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Then you came down just moments
after this thief had killed the Baron?

431
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,796
I tried to stop him but he
threw me to the ground and...

432
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:16,088
- Nonetheless, you saw him escape.
- Yes.

433
00:47:16,505 --> 00:47:18,505
- Were you injured?
- Stunned.

434
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:22,296
How lucky!
I won't keep you any longer.

435
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:26,588
I'm sure it's been quite
an ordeal for you.

436
00:47:30,838 --> 00:47:34,755
- By the way, that young man...
- Thomas?

437
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:37,921
- Thomas... where was he?
- He doesn't live here.

438
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:41,296
- He comes early in the morning.
- Very good.

439
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:48,213
- He didn't believe us.
- Yes, he did.

440
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,005
He was just trying to frighten us.

441
00:47:52,088 --> 00:47:55,671
You're marvellous, Charles.
Thank you.

442
00:47:57,088 --> 00:48:00,588
- And now?
- Now we wait.

443
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,338
It isn't going well today.

444
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:06,546
Look!

445
00:48:13,338 --> 00:48:15,421
Poor girl, she's dead.
Find a doctor.

446
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,796
Curses!

447
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,880
Who is it?

448
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:57,088
What do you want?

449
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,463
Nice place you've found, Lynch.
It's the height of fashion.

450
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:10,130
Reminds me of an asylum.
Yes, you know your stuff.

451
00:49:10,296 --> 00:49:13,921
The taste of a man who truly knows
what is obscene and vulgar...

452
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:16,005
erotic or simply grotesque.

453
00:49:16,005 --> 00:49:19,171
It's very smart
the way it all blends together.

454
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:21,880
The way in which
everything seems to match.

455
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,505
There isn't an object out of place,
not a centimetre wasted.

456
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,046
It's quite remarkable.
I'm impressed.

457
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Lynch.

458
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:33,921
You're a foul individual.

459
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:39,796
Something wrong?
Are the prisons empty this morning?

460
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:41,463
Not at all, quite the opposite.

461
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:45,380
Some of your friends were kind enough
to spend the night with me.

462
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,255
- I don't have any friends.
- Yes, you do.

463
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,088
Simon Burke and Harry Morse.

464
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:54,213
Not to mention Jim Turner,
and that other one, the hunchback.

465
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,171
- Were they drunk?
- Very.

466
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,963
They made quite a racket in the tavern
near the sawmill, do you know the place?

467
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:06,630
Yes, but what do four drunks
have to do with me?

468
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:10,338
The fight was over which
one of them had to pay the bill...

469
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:13,588
which was quite substantial.
Your friends drink, as you know.

470
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,255
You haven't answered my question.

471
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:18,880
ReaHy?
I have one for you.

472
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,838
Where did four men like that
find enough money...

473
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,171
to spend the entire night partying?

474
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:26,796
- Work?
- Perhaps.

475
00:50:27,796 --> 00:50:31,755
But what kind of work?
Simon and Harry can't earn much.

476
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,588
After all, how many hangings do we have?

477
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:38,671
- Not enough for you.
- You disappoint me.

478
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:42,630
I don't dish out sentences,
I limit myself to arresting people.

479
00:50:43,505 --> 00:50:47,046
- Were you drinking alone, Lynch?
- No, not alone!

480
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,421
Are you in the mood, Captain?

481
00:50:50,755 --> 00:50:52,838
Two of those men work for you.

482
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:57,546
I can't see you paying anyone enough
to afford a night on the tiles.

483
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,380
You're right, I wouldn't.

484
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,046
Perhaps they found something else
that undoubtedly pays a lot.

485
00:51:08,296 --> 00:51:10,046
I'm notjoking, Lynch.

486
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:11,880
Tell me what kind of work
they do for you...

487
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,338
given that you don't concern
yourself with legitimate business.

488
00:51:14,963 --> 00:51:16,963
I know you're very resourceful.

489
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:22,380
I hear you're a loan-shark now
but your helpers, what...

490
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,546
They're debt collectors.
They collect for me.

491
00:51:25,088 --> 00:51:27,921
Yes, it couldn't be anything else.

492
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:33,380
I'll leave you to what a man
like you would call...

493
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,171
Exactly what a man like you
would call it.

494
00:51:36,588 --> 00:51:40,713
Lynch, one clay you'll say the
wrong thing at the right moment.

495
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:50,046
Captain!

496
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:55,005
- What is it, Peter?
- Sarah Welles and Fred Benson are dead.

497
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:58,171
John Masters was with Sarah,
he saw the killer.

498
00:51:58,171 --> 00:52:01,005
- He says it was a monster.
- What?

499
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:05,171
A monster, a huge being,
ugly, with one eye.

500
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,338
Question him, he'll confirm it.

501
00:52:09,255 --> 00:52:12,463
I can't figure out where
this being came from.

502
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:18,713
You must intervene, I can't control
the crowd, they're very excited.

503
00:52:19,046 --> 00:52:21,505
We need to calm them down,
but also put them on guard...

504
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:24,630
inviting them to work with us on
this unusual case.

505
00:52:25,546 --> 00:52:26,671
I'll do my best.

506
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:35,880
Calm down, we're working
on a plan to catch this maniac.

507
00:52:36,213 --> 00:52:39,338
Locked up in your office?
You've got your eyes closed!

508
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:41,421
We admit we were taken by surprise.

509
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:44,963
We're going to need your help
before reinforcements arrive.

510
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:48,755
- He thinks we're lying!
- We'll deal with him once and for all!

511
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:52,130
If we've got to move, let's do it.
Me first!

512
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:53,921
- Are you with me?
- Yes!

513
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,046
Go home and don't do anything foolish.

514
00:52:57,921 --> 00:53:02,380
Let us do our work.
We'll call you if we need you.

515
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,630
Don't take matters into your own hands,
it might cost you clearly.

516
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:09,880
If you see him, tell us, but don't
confront him, you could get killed.

517
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,880
I must warn you, don't wander from
your homes, especially at night.

518
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:19,255
Now clear out.

519
00:53:29,963 --> 00:53:30,963
Come in.

520
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:42,838
It's pointless.

521
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,046
You won't find the answer in there.

522
00:53:48,213 --> 00:53:49,755
There is no answer anymore.

523
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,380
I know the answer.

524
00:53:53,588 --> 00:53:56,005
I'm just looking for a way
to put it into practice.

525
00:53:57,338 --> 00:53:58,505
Will you help me?

526
00:53:59,796 --> 00:54:01,213
I don't know.

527
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,005
You'll help me.

528
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:09,296
I don't know,
I can't commit myself...

529
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:12,088
until I know what you think
the answer is?

530
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:14,463
Another creature.

531
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:19,671
Tanya, it took me and your father
three years to build the first one.

532
00:54:20,046 --> 00:54:24,088
- Less than three weeks for mine.
- Even three hours, it's still too late.

533
00:54:24,963 --> 00:54:27,213
- Then there's been another murder.
- Two!

534
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,463
I didn't want to tell you.
I went into town today.

535
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:35,255
Everyone's talking about that creature,
they call it the monster.

536
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,505
That's what they call your father's
lifetime's work, a monster!

537
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:42,130
- And they're right!
- They're not!

538
00:54:43,338 --> 00:54:44,796
My father was a genius.

539
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:48,880
- His creature exists.
- All it does is kill.

540
00:54:49,755 --> 00:54:53,546
You don't understand,
even without the lesion on the brain...

541
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:57,505
that creature has the mind of a killer,
it kills for the pleasure of killing.

542
00:54:57,505 --> 00:55:00,921
It must be destroyed.
Harris will destroy it.

543
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:03,213
How can a man destroy it?

544
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:06,671
Charles, there's only one solution.

545
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,921
Create another creature.

546
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:15,671
- You'll create another monster.
- No, an executioner!

547
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:20,171
Our creature will kill my
father's murderer.

548
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:24,421
It's impossible, even if you
found the right brain...

549
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,838
Your creature, despite the superhuman
powers the lightning will give it...

550
00:55:29,046 --> 00:55:32,755
will need a body physically
strong enough to handle it.

551
00:55:33,255 --> 00:55:35,505
Where will you find a man like that?

552
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:40,255
If I find him, will you help me?

553
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:48,421
That's my offer.

554
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,880
£500 if you get me the right man.

555
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:54,255
What makes you think that?

556
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,213
My father told me.
It's all in his diary.

557
00:56:00,005 --> 00:56:02,130
All of his business dealings with you.

558
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,880
- I don't want money from you.
- I understand.

559
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,171
I knew it.

560
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:11,171
Just for one night,
then you'll have your man.

561
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,588
He won't cost you a penny.

562
00:56:12,796 --> 00:56:13,796
It will.

563
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:16,213
Your price is too high.

564
00:56:16,546 --> 00:56:20,546
I don't care what you think of me,
I don't want your sympathy.

565
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:25,463
- You disgust me.
- Then spend your money elsewhere.

566
00:56:26,546 --> 00:56:31,046
Captain Harris might find my
father's diary very interesting.

567
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,505
That I sell corpses wouldn't
surprise anyone...

568
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:39,046
but your father buying them would
certainly raise an eyebrow...

569
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:40,213
and you wouldn't want that, right?

570
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,630
Think about it.
No one else can help you.

571
00:56:45,296 --> 00:56:48,546
No one.
Besides, I'm not asking much.

572
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:51,671
One night won't kill you.

573
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:54,380
Have a nice bath and everything
will be just like before.

574
00:57:06,296 --> 00:57:07,380
I'll kill him.

575
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:09,213
I'll kill him!

576
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:11,588
You need a drink, Charles.

577
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,338
I don't understand why you're so upset.

578
00:57:15,046 --> 00:57:17,671
You can't take a man
like Lynch seriously.

579
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:20,046
I still want to kill him!
How could he have thought...

580
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:21,421
Thank you, Charles.

581
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:25,380
I had no idea you were
so interested in my reputation.

582
00:57:27,546 --> 00:57:30,255
I'm sorry, of course.

583
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:32,005
You're a gentleman.

584
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:34,671
And you think of me
as someone who's untouchable.

585
00:57:34,671 --> 00:57:35,671
You're wrong.

586
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,255
Really? Have you ever thought
about touching me?

587
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:40,880
Tanya, please.

588
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:45,130
Does it upset you that much knowing
a man like Lynch wants me?

589
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:49,713
No, it's just that it was most
vulgar of him to say it.

590
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,171
You want me, Charles.
It's the only reason you stayed.

591
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,838
- And if it were true?
- Then why not tell me?

592
00:57:58,338 --> 00:57:59,838
Because you were scared.

593
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:02,546
You've always been scared,
of everything.

594
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,005
Even now you're scared.

595
00:58:06,088 --> 00:58:08,213
We don't need Lynch anymore.

596
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:13,130
I've found him... Thomas!

597
00:58:13,713 --> 00:58:16,296
- Thomas?
- Yes, Thomas.

598
00:58:16,463 --> 00:58:19,546
Physically he's perfect,
and you know what his body's like.

599
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,755
He's strong, handsome,
he can handle it.

600
00:58:22,463 --> 00:58:25,546
- What does that have to do with...
- Everything, because you love me.

601
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:28,505
You love me, but you've never
clone anything about it.

602
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,171
Instead of letting your love for me
give you strength...

603
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:35,130
- Stop it.
- You've become a spineless old man.

604
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:40,421
You're so weak, all you can do is
undress me with those perverted eyes.

605
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:44,505
The eyes of an old man incapable of
even thinking that I could love him.

606
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:48,880
You could...

607
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:53,296
Could you love me?

608
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:57,088
Yes.
If you were like Thomas.

609
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:00,963
Then you love Thomas!

610
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:06,088
I can't love Thomas,
he doesn't have your mind.

611
00:59:07,338 --> 00:59:10,255
Think about it.
Think of me.

612
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:13,046
Think about loving me.

613
00:59:14,005 --> 00:59:16,213
I know you want me.

614
00:59:17,463 --> 00:59:19,546
You want to make love to me.

615
00:59:20,463 --> 00:59:21,463
YGS.

616
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:23,921
Yes! Yes!

617
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:28,338
You can, Charles.
I'll make it possible.

618
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:37,088
My brain and my heart,
in Thomas' body.

619
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:39,755
His heart is as kind as yours.

620
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:44,838
Thomas with your brain.
There's a man I could love.

621
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,421
N0.

622
00:59:48,921 --> 00:59:53,213
I won't kill Thomas for you.
I'm not a murderer.

623
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,171
- You were ready to kill Lynch.
- That was different.

624
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,671
One's the same as the other.

625
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,088
I'll help you, Charles,
and I'll give you everything.

626
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:07,755
I'll be your wife, when you want.

627
01:00:12,963 --> 01:00:16,046
- Tell Tanya Lynch is here.
- N0, no, no!

628
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:19,171
- Go and tell her...
- Go away!

629
01:00:19,338 --> 01:00:21,130
Very well, I'll come back tomorrow.

630
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,755
They're not at home,
or you don't know where they've gone?

631
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:30,088
You're completely crazy!

632
01:00:31,046 --> 01:00:32,005
G0!

633
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:57,171
D0 you like it?

634
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,421
- Yes, a lot.
- I've had that ring for a long time.

635
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:06,588
I never thought I'd
see it shine on your finger.

636
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:20,755
Good morning, Charles.

637
01:02:21,546 --> 01:02:23,255
Stop thinking about Thomas.

638
01:02:24,588 --> 01:02:26,046
Think about him later.

639
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:31,171
Come.
Over there.

640
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,838
Lynch, you fooled me.

641
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,713
Daddy, the monster!

642
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,463
Damn you!

643
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Jack!

644
01:03:27,588 --> 01:03:28,546
Jack!

645
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:04,796
John Lynch is dead?

646
01:04:04,796 --> 01:04:08,671
Last night, killed by the same man
who murdered his father.

647
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:11,213
Nothing was stolen there
either, Lady Frankenstein.

648
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,338
Lady Marshall now, Captain.

649
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:15,213
Congratulations.

650
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:19,421
This man, did anyone
see him who's still alive?

651
01:04:19,671 --> 01:04:23,213
Yes, the young man who was
with Sarah Welles, John Masters.

652
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:25,838
My husband told me
everybody thinks it's a monster.

653
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,296
They can think what they like.

654
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:33,505
John Masters insists it wasn't a man,
but he was too scared to be believed.

655
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,213
- Do you believe him?
- No, I didn't say that.

656
01:04:36,213 --> 01:04:40,963
The Atkins boy watched the murderer
kill his mother but he's in shock...

657
01:04:40,963 --> 01:04:43,213
and I don't know
when I'll be able to talk to him.

658
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,338
Poor boy.

659
01:04:44,963 --> 01:04:48,838
- Thank you for the tea.
- I'll accompany you.

660
01:04:49,546 --> 01:04:54,630
I was wondering why you visited
Lynch at his home at night?

661
01:04:55,046 --> 01:04:58,588
The Baron owed him money.
My wife went to pay him.

662
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,130
- Why didn't you ask him to come here?
- But how, Captain?

663
01:05:02,421 --> 01:05:04,921
- A man like Lynch, here?
- No, of course.

664
01:05:04,921 --> 01:05:10,296
- Then why didn't Doctor Marshall go?
- It my was father's debt, that's why.

665
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:12,255
- Is there a problem?
- Right.

666
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:16,046
But I don't understand why your
father had a debt with Lynch.

667
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,963
Captain, I find you impertinent!

668
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:21,005
I always am.
Thanks again, and excuse me.

669
01:05:21,796 --> 01:05:23,130
One last thing, Mrs.

670
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,421
You don't believe
in monsters, do you?

671
01:05:26,296 --> 01:05:28,630
- Of course not.
- I do.

672
01:05:57,671 --> 01:05:59,838
Have you finished yet?

673
01:06:00,755 --> 01:06:02,671
You're worse than Lynch.

674
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:08,255
Are you sure
Doctor Marshall will want it?

675
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,213
Of course I'm sure.

676
01:06:13,505 --> 01:06:17,838
Whatever the Baron did with the corpses,
Doctor Marshall was helping him.

677
01:06:18,046 --> 01:06:23,130
I'm sure he's doing what the Baron did
with them, and he'll be most grateful.

678
01:06:24,505 --> 01:06:26,338
To hell with his gratitude.

679
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,255
As long as he pays us well.

680
01:06:29,588 --> 01:06:33,463
This is no life,
I want women and good whiskey!

681
01:06:33,463 --> 01:06:37,338
- I don't work for you.
- Quiet! I hear someone.

682
01:06:43,963 --> 01:06:45,713
Who could it be?

683
01:07:16,296 --> 01:07:19,213
This is how I found them, Captain.

684
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:21,671
I got here early, like I always do.

685
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,338
I like things tidy.
Every morning...

686
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:29,463
Yes, thank you, Mr Stone.
That's all for now.

687
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:34,338
I keep a clean ship Captain,
and quiet as well.

688
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:37,588
Grave robbers?
It doesn't make sense.

689
01:07:38,171 --> 01:07:41,463
Actually, it's starting to make a lot
of sense, grab those shovels.

690
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:51,755
Dig here, then dig up all the graves
from the last two months.

691
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,630
What do you hope to find?

692
01:07:54,755 --> 01:07:56,255
Not a damned thing.

693
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,630
Thank you, you can put them down.

694
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:19,171
No Thomas, I wasn't laughing at you.

695
01:08:22,463 --> 01:08:26,338
- Don't be afraid of me.
- No, lady.

696
01:08:26,713 --> 01:08:28,880
No, I'm not afraid.

697
01:08:30,671 --> 01:08:33,713
Come on, let's put these away.

698
01:08:44,546 --> 01:08:46,880
- There.
- One...

699
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,130
Go.

700
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:25,296
That's better, isn't it?

701
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:34,380
Sit down, Thomas.

702
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,296
Sit down.

703
01:09:59,588 --> 01:10:02,421
Haven't you made love before?
Don't you want me?

704
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,088
D0 you want me?

705
01:10:24,546 --> 01:10:26,713
You're handsome.

706
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,713
Tommy! Tommy!

707
01:12:29,838 --> 01:12:31,255
Are you looking for someone?

708
01:12:33,505 --> 01:12:35,255
Yes, I'm looking for...

709
01:12:36,296 --> 01:12:39,463
- I'm looking for my brother.
- Your brother? You must be mistaken.

710
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,380
Tommy.
Thomas Stark.

711
01:12:41,713 --> 01:12:44,588
He isn't here.
Have you tried his house?

712
01:12:44,588 --> 01:12:45,630
I've just come from there.

713
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:48,796
He hasn't been here for a few clays.

714
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:52,421
Where could he have gone?
He's never left the county.

715
01:12:52,963 --> 01:12:56,588
Who knows? Perhaps it has something
to do with the death of my father.

716
01:12:57,213 --> 01:13:00,838
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- Thomas was very close to my father.

717
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:02,630
His death must have upset him greatly.

718
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,296
I imagine so.

719
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:09,338
I'm sorry you came all this way,
but I'm sure Thomas isn't far.

720
01:13:09,588 --> 01:13:12,005
- Are you staying in the village?
- Yes, of course.

721
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,796
Then I'll tell him.
He'll be glad to see you.

722
01:13:15,046 --> 01:13:16,838
Thank you.
Thank you, lady...

723
01:13:16,838 --> 01:13:20,505
- Lady Marshall.
- Sorry if I disturbed you, Lady Marshall.

724
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:23,671
We're all very close to your brother.

725
01:13:24,046 --> 01:13:25,963
I'm sure you are.
Good clay.

726
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:50,546
Julia, I've got enough to worry about
with this killer on the loose...

727
01:13:50,546 --> 01:13:52,255
and now with Thomas' disappearance.

728
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:54,546
- Find Tom.
- I promise.

729
01:13:55,588 --> 01:14:00,380
That Lady Marshall, I don't like her.
I know what those women are like.

730
01:14:00,588 --> 01:14:02,921
She could destroy a man
and then...

731
01:14:02,921 --> 01:14:09,255
- Julia, everything's fine, trust me.
- I'm trying as hard as I can.

732
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:11,213
Please, Julia.

733
01:14:15,713 --> 01:14:17,505
She seems like a nice person.

734
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:21,963
She's nothing like Lady Marshall.
She makes me nervous.

735
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:25,338
Her ancl her father's experiments,
animal transplants...

736
01:14:25,338 --> 01:14:28,796
That's what she said,
and Doctor Marshall didn't deny it.

737
01:14:28,796 --> 01:14:31,338
- Why would he?
- Why did they need cadavers?

738
01:14:31,338 --> 01:14:33,046
What do you do with a cadaver, Peter?

739
01:14:33,463 --> 01:14:34,463
Let's go.

740
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:42,838
You'll need two pints of my blood
in order to fill this sack.

741
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:48,588
The blood is pumped from the sack
using these two batteries.

742
01:14:52,046 --> 01:14:53,130
Very good.

743
01:14:54,796 --> 01:14:57,463
With compliments from
Count Alessandro Volta.

744
01:14:58,338 --> 01:15:02,463
Don't be surprised Charles,
I read my father's medical diary.

745
01:15:02,463 --> 01:15:04,463
But I've known about
Volta for a number of years.

746
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:08,213
Ancl Luigi Galvani ancl his
experiments to produce electricity...

747
01:15:08,213 --> 01:15:09,963
with methods employing electrochemistry.

748
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,588
Very simple but efficient.

749
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:21,921
The copper pipes carry a
magnetic pulse to the sack...

750
01:15:21,921 --> 01:15:24,880
causing it to expand
and contract like bellows.

751
01:15:25,171 --> 01:15:29,296
Then the blood is pumped from
the sack and comes down this tube...

752
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:30,963
and enters the brain.

753
01:15:31,463 --> 01:15:35,755
Providing a continuous flow of blood
from the sack to the brain...

754
01:15:36,421 --> 01:15:37,671
and vice versa.

755
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:42,755
- What about the oxygen for the brain?
- It's liquid.

756
01:15:43,588 --> 01:15:45,880
First, fill the container with this.

757
01:15:46,338 --> 01:15:48,380
Then connect the two tubes to the brain.

758
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:51,921
Then put the brain in the glass
container and preserve it.

759
01:15:52,338 --> 01:15:56,380
- Can it stay like that indefinitely?
- Indefinitely.

760
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:02,880
In his diary, my father wrote
that he tried to help Thomas.

761
01:16:03,755 --> 01:16:05,171
What went wrong?

762
01:16:06,296 --> 01:16:08,630
Nothing, it's just that
Galvani's theory...

763
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,421
would have turned Thomas
into a vegetable.

764
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:13,380
How much current did you give him?

765
01:16:13,755 --> 01:16:17,171
Enough to help him,
but not enough to hurt him.

766
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:30,505
Tonight, you and I will help Thomas
become a real human being.

767
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:33,963
And my father...

768
01:16:35,588 --> 01:16:37,338
will live again.

769
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,255
But with the fame he deserved.

770
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,171
Charles.

771
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,255
I love you, Tanya.

772
01:16:52,338 --> 01:16:53,463
Really.

773
01:16:57,421 --> 01:16:59,505
Think of tonight, Charles.

774
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:02,463
Just tonight.

775
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:11,255
Zack, you damned fool, I should lock
you up and throw away the key!

776
01:17:11,463 --> 01:17:14,505
- Someone had to do something.
- Yes, but you haven't clone a thing.

777
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,463
Someone could have died,
including you.

778
01:17:17,463 --> 01:17:20,463
But I was right,
that's no human being.

779
01:17:20,463 --> 01:17:24,088
We must have shot it twenty times
but it just kept coming!

780
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:25,421
Twenty times, Zack?

781
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:29,463
At least ten, well maybe not ten,
but four or five, yes.

782
01:17:29,796 --> 01:17:32,796
- Four or five, then?
- It's true, Captain.

783
01:17:32,796 --> 01:17:37,796
Men lose blood but that monster,
nothing, it didn't lose a drop!

784
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:42,380
Very well, Zack.
Go home, but ifl hear that you...

785
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,213
You've got to kill it,
I don't how, but you've got to!

786
01:17:45,213 --> 01:17:46,505
But you must hurry!

787
01:17:47,505 --> 01:17:49,380
You wouldn't happen
to be threatening me?

788
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:53,088
It isn't a threat, it's a fact.
People talk.

789
01:17:53,255 --> 01:17:55,921
They're saying it's
Baron Frankenstein's fault.

790
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,296
- That thing killed him, don't forget.
- But it didn't kill his daughter.

791
01:17:59,463 --> 01:18:00,880
What does she have to do with it?

792
01:18:01,755 --> 01:18:04,838
You know what people are like,
especially when they're scared.

793
01:18:04,838 --> 01:18:08,963
And right now they're so scared
they're capable of anything.

794
01:18:08,963 --> 01:18:10,588
Something crazy, even.

795
01:18:10,588 --> 01:18:13,630
For them, the name Frankenstein
is synonymous with the Devil.

796
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,171
Under any guise.

797
01:18:16,921 --> 01:18:18,005
Let's go.

798
01:18:35,588 --> 01:18:38,796
What is it?
S0mething's wrong.

799
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:44,963
It's late, Tanya.
I killed Thomas.

800
01:18:45,463 --> 01:18:49,213
You must make sure the ends
justify the means, for me.

801
01:18:49,713 --> 01:18:52,671
What if it doesn't work?
Charles, I...

802
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,338
Tanya, I'd rather give my life
to you than the hangman.

803
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,463
Is everything ready?

804
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:04,921
No questions?

805
01:19:06,213 --> 01:19:07,838
No, no questions.

806
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:13,463
Tanya, remember that I love you.

807
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:15,713
I'll remember.

808
01:19:16,421 --> 01:19:17,713
Now smile.

809
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,713
It's the last thing I want to see.

810
01:19:24,713 --> 01:19:25,921
Thank you.

811
01:19:29,755 --> 01:19:31,255
Now begin.

812
01:20:02,171 --> 01:20:04,796
I don't like your sudden visits.

813
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:10,380
I'm trying to find your father's killer,
I don't see why it should upset you.

814
01:20:15,255 --> 01:20:17,880
You're right.
Forgive me.

815
01:20:21,505 --> 01:20:23,713
But I've been by my
husband's side all night.

816
01:20:23,921 --> 01:20:27,296
- Then he's seriously ill.
- It's possible.

817
01:20:27,796 --> 01:20:30,463
He's resting now,
and after breakfast so shall I.

818
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:34,421
- Is your investigation progressing?
- Not really, but the killer is.

819
01:20:34,671 --> 01:20:37,755
Another two men have been killed,
Jim Turner and Bill Jessop.

820
01:20:37,755 --> 01:20:39,046
They worked for Lynch.

821
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:41,880
You wouldn't know them, they weren't
the type you'd invite home for tea.

822
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:45,046
Why did you ask about Thomas earlier?

823
01:20:45,463 --> 01:20:48,338
Only because a clear friend
asked me to say hello to him.

824
01:20:48,921 --> 01:20:51,296
You mean his sister
asked you to look for him.

825
01:20:51,505 --> 01:20:53,921
I thought I was quite clear yesterday.

826
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:57,796
- She obviously didn't believe me.
- Only she could tell you.

827
01:20:59,713 --> 01:21:03,213
- Do you believe me?
- Why would you lie?

828
01:21:03,546 --> 01:21:07,546
- Women never lie to you?
- Always, Lady Marshall.

829
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:19,838
Charles!

830
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:24,130
<i>I can't wait for the storm.
It may not come in time.</i>

831
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:29,921
<i>I need to generate enough electricity
to reactivate your brain and Thomas' heart.</i>

832
01:21:30,255 --> 01:21:32,213
<i>I can't wait for lightning.</i>

833
01:21:33,005 --> 01:21:35,880
<i>I can create the same
type of energy artificially.</i>

834
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:39,671
<i>You and my father had
experimented on Thomas.</i>

835
01:21:39,838 --> 01:21:43,630
<i>Only you were afraid you'd kill him
if the current was too strong.</i>

836
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:46,921
Everything's ready, my clear.

837
01:21:47,921 --> 01:21:49,296
Don't be afraid.

838
01:22:10,213 --> 01:22:12,588
They laughed at my father, Charles.

839
01:22:13,546 --> 01:22:15,213
But they won't laugh at me.

840
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:17,796
Thank you, dear.

841
01:22:23,255 --> 01:22:24,546
Have faith.

842
01:22:40,713 --> 01:22:42,213
It's working.

843
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:45,796
Now let's see how much current we need.

844
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,546
Get ready, Charles.

845
01:23:06,755 --> 01:23:09,046
We've almost clone it this time, Charles.

846
01:23:09,255 --> 01:23:10,838
Just a little longer, clear.

847
01:23:11,005 --> 01:23:12,338
A little longer.

848
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,505
You're alive, clear.

849
01:23:48,546 --> 01:23:49,796
You're alive.

850
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:57,546
You're alive.

851
01:24:02,296 --> 01:24:05,213
- Tanya.
- I'm here.

852
01:24:08,796 --> 01:24:10,088
I'm here.

853
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,921
I'm cold.

854
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:17,505
I'm cold.

855
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,213
Dear!

856
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:29,171
You don't expect me to believe that?

857
01:24:29,338 --> 01:24:31,338
It's true Julia, I saw it.

858
01:24:31,338 --> 01:24:33,796
You think Tommy has something
to do with this monster?

859
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:36,755
Not of his own volition,
he may have been coerced into it.

860
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:38,671
Tommy doesn't shine with intelligence.

861
01:24:38,838 --> 01:24:41,463
Then Lady Marshall's
mixed up in this as well?

862
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:43,921
You don't like her, do you?

863
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:47,713
I'm sure she lied to me
when I asked her about Tommy.

864
01:24:47,713 --> 01:24:51,046
Paul, I'm scared, help me.
I'm scared they'll kill him.

865
01:24:51,046 --> 01:24:54,755
- Now don't exaggerate.
- I'm scared I won't see him again.

866
01:25:20,505 --> 01:25:21,671
The monster!

867
01:25:24,088 --> 01:25:25,046
Shoot!

868
01:25:25,755 --> 01:25:26,713
Again!

869
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:18,546
Let's get out of here!

870
01:26:51,796 --> 01:26:55,130
Follow me, but be careful.
Don't take any unnecessary risks.

871
01:27:00,088 --> 01:27:04,171
When I remove the stitches no one will
notice the difference, I'm sure of it.

872
01:27:04,796 --> 01:27:07,130
Okay, let's see what you can do.

873
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:12,671
Come on, Thomas.
Get ready with your hands.

874
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:19,505
When I drop the paper,
try to catch it as soon as it falls.

875
01:27:19,963 --> 01:27:21,880
Look at me.
Are you ready?

876
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:24,088
YES.

877
01:27:25,338 --> 01:27:26,880
Good, Thomas!

878
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:29,505
Your reflexes are perfect,
your pulse is normal...

879
01:27:35,963 --> 01:27:39,088
How could I have known the
storm would come in time?

880
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,338
You couldn't have.

881
01:27:40,796 --> 01:27:42,463
There's one more thing.

882
01:27:43,088 --> 01:27:45,046
Try lifting that desk.

883
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,546
- That one?
- G0 on.

884
01:28:00,755 --> 01:28:03,463
Go on Thomas, lift it.

885
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:33,088
- I'd never have thought I could do it.
- Now you can, Thomas. You're young again.

886
01:28:33,338 --> 01:28:36,588
A handsome, strong,
intelligent young man.

887
01:28:42,546 --> 01:28:43,838
Lady Marshall!

888
01:28:44,338 --> 01:28:45,546
Lady Marshall!

889
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:47,921
What is it?

890
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:51,463
It's Captain Harris, he insists on
seeing you, he won't leave.

891
01:28:52,505 --> 01:28:55,880
Tanya, you must see him immediately.
Don't be afraid.

892
01:28:56,255 --> 01:28:59,171
Everything's going to be fine.
G0, hurry!

893
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:06,255
- I must see Doctor Marshall.
- Impossible, he's very sick.

894
01:29:06,255 --> 01:29:09,005
- I'm not asking your permission!
- This is unlawful entry!

895
01:29:09,005 --> 01:29:11,421
- Yes, you're quite right.
- I'll report you to your superiors.

896
01:29:11,421 --> 01:29:12,796
- Go ahead.
- I will.

897
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:15,796
- Where's his room?
- Please leave this house!

898
01:29:15,796 --> 01:29:17,171
Not until I've seen your husband.

899
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:23,630
Sorry, but my illness is very
contagious, don't come too close.

900
01:29:25,088 --> 01:29:26,713
I need to speak to you alone.

901
01:29:26,713 --> 01:29:29,171
Whatever you have to tell me,
I want my wife to hear it.

902
01:29:30,171 --> 01:29:33,921
I came to warn you about the monster
you created with Baron Frankenstein.

903
01:29:33,921 --> 01:29:37,046
I hold you responsible for the deaths
of eight people, including the Baron.

904
01:29:38,505 --> 01:29:42,338
- Can you prove it?
- I'd be here to arrest you if I could.

905
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:45,130
I know you're responsible.
I want you to stay alive.

906
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:47,588
Why would someone want
to kill my husband?

907
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:50,880
Not someone, the monster
he helped create...

908
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,088
which has already killed the four
people responsible for giving it life...

909
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:55,796
and you, doctor,
are the fifth and last.

910
01:29:56,255 --> 01:29:58,755
You're out of your mind.
How could they...

911
01:29:58,755 --> 01:30:01,463
Supplying your father
and your husband with cadavers.

912
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:04,255
I don't need to tell you
how they were used.

913
01:30:05,171 --> 01:30:07,505
We have no idea
what you're talking about.

914
01:30:07,671 --> 01:30:09,255
Those vases in the laboratory.

915
01:30:09,255 --> 01:30:12,671
It wouldn't be hard to prove that
they contain human organs.

916
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:17,921
N0, you never thought that your monster
may not appreciate your miracle.

917
01:30:17,921 --> 01:30:20,421
That's why it killed the Baron
and the other three men.

918
01:30:20,421 --> 01:30:22,130
That's why it will kill you as well.

919
01:30:22,421 --> 01:30:24,880
Why didn't it kill my husband
after it killed my father?

920
01:30:25,046 --> 01:30:27,505
Perhaps your husband wasn't
in the laboratory.

921
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,296
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard.

922
01:30:30,296 --> 01:30:33,880
You have quite an imagination.
It was a thief that killed the Baron.

923
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,421
As for Lynch and those
other two champions of honesty...

924
01:30:36,588 --> 01:30:39,171
anyone would have had sufficient
reason to kill them.

925
01:30:39,546 --> 01:30:43,255
Perhaps it's your incompetence that's
allowing your imagination to run riot.

926
01:30:43,796 --> 01:30:46,380
- I recommend a long rest.
- Excellent.

927
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:51,796
But please don't forget that
I warned you in time.

928
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:55,963
Your concern comforts me greatly.
Goodnight, Captain.

929
01:30:56,380 --> 01:31:00,380
Whatever you've clone to Thomas,
there isn't a hiding place that I won't find.

930
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:11,130
- My best wishes to the doctor.
- Thank you.

931
01:31:24,463 --> 01:31:27,755
- We must leave tonight, Thomas.
- No, Tanya.

932
01:31:28,005 --> 01:31:31,963
Harris and his men will find the monster
and they'll destroy it.

933
01:31:32,255 --> 01:31:33,838
They don't know how.

934
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:35,838
I do.

935
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,880
All available men, the place has
to be completely surrounded.

936
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,505
Make sure they don't tell anyone.
Hurry!

937
01:31:45,921 --> 01:31:46,921
Let's go!

938
01:32:04,296 --> 01:32:09,380
- D0 you know where to find him?
- He'll find me, tonight.

939
01:32:10,713 --> 01:32:12,213
He'll come here tonight.

940
01:32:13,171 --> 01:32:14,421
Oh, Thomas.

941
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:14,213
Monster!

942
01:33:20,171 --> 01:33:21,546
Look out, Thomas!

943
01:33:22,213 --> 01:33:23,255
Thomas, wait.

944
01:33:23,505 --> 01:33:26,421
You don't have to kill it because
it doesn't need to kill anymore.

945
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:30,505
Now we can keep it at bay and show
the world my father hadn't failed.

946
01:33:30,796 --> 01:33:32,171
That he wasn't a lunatic.

947
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,713
Think of us, Thomas.
The fame, the money!

948
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:37,338
N0, I must kill it!

949
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:40,671
You're right, kill it.

950
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,880
Why did you change your mind, Tanya?
Why?

951
01:33:45,213 --> 01:33:49,671
Because you only need one of us to live,
then you'll have what you want.

952
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:51,171
- That's it!
- N0!

953
01:34:00,255 --> 01:34:01,880
- It's the Captain!
- Is he dead?

954
01:34:02,963 --> 01:34:06,505
- No, he's just passed out.
- Let him sleep, we can handle this.

955
01:35:45,796 --> 01:35:48,213
This is unwise.
Be careful, Julia.

956
01:35:50,046 --> 01:35:51,255
You, follow me!

957
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:55,046
Paul!

958
01:35:58,296 --> 01:36:01,296
- Peter, why did you bring her here?
- Captain, I...

959
01:36:01,505 --> 01:36:06,630
- The monster's inside the house!
- Zack's men are burning everything!

960
01:36:06,796 --> 01:36:08,713
That lunatic!
Julia, wait here.

961
01:36:53,546 --> 01:36:54,546
N0!

962
01:36:56,505 --> 01:36:57,713
Spare me!

963
01:37:18,963 --> 01:37:20,005
You love me!

964
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:21,671
You love me!

965
01:37:22,088 --> 01:37:23,171
You love me!

966
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,338
I belong to you.

967
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:30,588
Yes, Thomas, kiss me!

968
01:37:32,963 --> 01:37:34,005
Spread out!

969
01:37:35,838 --> 01:37:36,838
Over here!

970
01:37:39,046 --> 01:37:41,463
Everything!
Burn everything!

971
01:37:53,796 --> 01:37:55,921
Who authorised you to do this?

972
01:37:56,213 --> 01:37:58,005
Arrest him!
Take him away!

973
01:38:02,838 --> 01:38:04,755
- Julia!
- Tommy!

974
01:38:04,755 --> 01:38:07,296
- He's here!
- N0, you can't!

975
01:38:24,671 --> 01:38:25,630
My 90d!

976
01:38:54,713 --> 01:38:57,630
THE END

977
01:38:58,046 --> 01:39:00,755
