1
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,751
Cadet troop forward! Ho!

2
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:32,883
Fours, right about! Ho!

3
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:42,018
That is right.
Fours, right about! Ho!

4
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,771
Form fours. Ho!

5
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,066
Second section, the man on the
right, number two, close in.

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,390
Come on, pick it up,
pick it up.

7
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:55,323
At a gallop. Ho!

8
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,910
To the right. Ho!

9
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,924
Troop, dismount!
Fall out!

10
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,803
- William Pender.
- Here.

11
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,805
- Charles Sawtell.
- Here.

12
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,516
- Jeb Stuart.
- Yep.

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,810
- George Custer.
- Yep.

14
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,979
- George Pickett.
- Here.

15
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,482
- Robert Holliday.
- Here.

16
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,192
- James Longstreet.
- Yep.

17
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:32,985
- Carl Raider.
- Yep.

18
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,695
- Phillip Sheridan.
- Here.

19
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,530
John Hood.

20
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,158
Hey, Jeb, take a look
at this saddle sore.

21
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:41,452
You think
that's serious enough to report?

22
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,889
I don't know, George, but I've
certainly got to report mine.

23
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,540
You boys can have the cavalry.

24
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,793
Me, I'm gonna apply
for the infantry.

25
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,796
Tired of playing housemaid
to a temperamental mare.

26
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,857
That's the first good news
your horse has ever heard.

27
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:56,425
Go on, Gertrude, kiss him.

28
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,396
- Stand still you devil!
- Steady, boy.

29
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,023
If you weren't so hot-headed
you wouldn't hurt your mouth.

30
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,274
I told you before we started

31
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,652
you had that
curb chain on too tight.

32
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:16,779
It's not the first time
you've cut his tongue.

33
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,823
Ever tried putting a curb
on your tongue?

34
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,325
No, nobody else every tried it.

35
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,832
I suppose it takes one of you
southerners to handle a horse.

36
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:29,601
Well, at least, we know
how to harness them.

37
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,295
You know how to harness Negroes
down south too I hear.

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,215
With a strap across their back.
Come on.

39
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,196
When are you going to take
a punch at him?

40
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,889
Too close to graduation.

41
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,224
Besides if I waited four years

42
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:46,809
I guess I can wait
another week.

43
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:59,029
"The breaking up of the
American Union as of now exists

44
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,116
is the basis of my plan.”

45
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,785
"And that destruction must be
made upon the issue

46
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,831
of Negro slavery
and on no other."

47
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,875
"The union must then be
reorganized

48
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,879
on the great principle
of emancipation.”

49
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:18,299
"This object is vast
in its compass."

50
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,593
"Terrifying in its prospects
but sublime

51
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:23,387
and beautiful in its issue.”

52
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,348
"A life devoted to it
would be nobly spent

53
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,018
or sacrificed."

54
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,562
"If the federal government
in its constitution

55
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,440
"are opposed to my way
of thinking,

56
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:37,234
the fault is not mine,
but theirs."

57
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,237
"And I shall continue to oppose
them with every means

58
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,823
and every weapon
at my disposal.”

59
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,451
Who wrote that inflammatory rot?

60
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:48,662
A wise man by the name
of John Brown.

61
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,080
Mm, where did you get it?

62
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,041
That's my business,
if you don't like it

63
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,001
you don't have to listen to it.

64
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,212
You meant it for me,
didn't you?

65
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,673
- Take it anyway you like.
- Sure, he meant it for you.

66
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,109
He tried that abolitionists
stuff on me

67
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,968
until he found out
I came from Kansas.

68
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:06,680
Never mind, Bob.
Come on, Jeb, let's turn in.

69
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,725
There is no regulation against
a cadet having his own ideas.

70
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,353
But there is one spreading
treasonable policies.

71
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:15,648
You find the truth hard to take,

72
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,819
Listen, Rader, I know the truth
of this problem

73
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,153
far better than you do.

74
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,446
The south will settle it

75
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,406
in its own time
and in its own way.

76
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,283
But not through the propaganda
of renegades

77
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,495
like this John Brown
or any of his followers.

78
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,706
You mean that renegade line
to include me?

79
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,251
Look up your oath of allegiance
and answer that for yourself.

80
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,045
I'll answer that
right here and now.

81
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,173
I've taken a lot of you
southern snobs.

82
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,217
For 50 years now
you have been watering

83
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,637
your precious family trees
with the sweat of Negro slaves.

84
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,806
Piling up wealth
and snobbery until now

85
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,933
you think you own
the government and the army.

86
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:54,270
And anybody who disagrees
with you is a lying renegade.

87
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,314
A rebel rousing traitor.

88
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,234
Well, you get this from me,
Stuart.

89
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:04,488
And all you other
Mason Dixon plutocrats.

90
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,199
The time is coming when the rest
of us are going to wipe you

91
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,995
and your kind
off the face of the earth.

92
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,168
- Jeb, don't be a fool.
- Stop! Let them fight it out.

93
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,795
Hold it, Rader.

94
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,424
- Jeb.
- Jeb!

95
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,068
Attention!

96
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,788
For sometime I've been aware
that the disturbing force

97
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,249
has been active among
the regiment of cadets.

98
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,376
The exact nature of this
subversive campaign

99
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,337
and the persons
responsible for it

100
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,881
have not been fully known to us
until this moment.

101
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,300
Stuart, by every rule
of the academy

102
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:08,344
you should be discharged
from the service.

103
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,280
And your associates are
no less guilty for their part

104
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,181
in this outrageous affair.

105
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,975
Colonel Lee, any blame in this
matter is entirely upon me.

106
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,769
It's my sole responsibility,
sir.

107
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:19,146
That's not quite true, sir.
It was my fault.

108
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,814
We are all equally
responsible, sir.

109
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,834
- That's right, sir.
- That's right, sir.

110
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,669
If I believe that
you were guilty alone, Stuart

111
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:26,320
I should have
sent for you alone.

112
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:29,031
As for you, Custer,
and the rest of you

113
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:31,659
you must be taught
that lying to protect a friend

114
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,954
is sometimes an extremely
dangerous practice.

115
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,748
I'm not so greatly concerned
about the fight itself

116
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,583
as I am about its cause.

117
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,961
All seven of you men
violated the first sin

118
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,545
of military conduct.

119
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,423
The traffic and violent exchange
of political ideas.

120
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,759
Which are not the affairs
of an American solider.

121
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:52,888
You must be punished
and punished severely.

122
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,641
I shall request of the war
department upon your graduation

123
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,351
next week that all of you
be assigned

124
00:07:57,434 --> 00:08:01,271
to the most dangerous branch
of the United States Army.

125
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,399
The second United States
Cavalry.

126
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,192
Now stationed at
Fort Leavenworth

127
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,944
in the Kansas territory.

128
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,578
That's all, gentlemen,
you are dismissed.

129
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:27,214
Now send for Cadet Rader.

130
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:28,507
How can you read that?

131
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,259
Fort Leavenworth,
suicide station.

132
00:08:30,342 --> 00:08:32,553
Kansas in the Santa Fe Trail,
what a piece of luck!

133
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,763
That's it, and the cavalry,
active duty, promotion.

134
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,032
Why, we'll all be generals,
while the rest

135
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,266
are still chafing..

136
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,702
Oh, that's death of the country,
Jeb.

137
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,436
Nothing grows in Kansas
but trouble.

138
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,205
What are you talking about?
I grew up out there, didn't I?

139
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,856
Well, I suppose he's not.

140
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,333
Yeah, wait till
I get you boys out there

141
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,693
man alive, that's
my stamping grounds.

142
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:55,367
These pamphlets were found
in your quarters.

143
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,619
Dozens of them,
together with a letter

144
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,621
written by a member
of the abolitionists party

145
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,790
instructing you to distribute
them among those cadets

146
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,918
who appear to be
sympathetic to their cause.

147
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,355
How long has this undercover
activity of yours been going on?

148
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,714
Long enough.

149
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:10,507
Very clear idea
of your fellow conspirators

150
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,634
to plant an agent in our midst.

151
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,637
Your dishonorable discharge
will be drawn up at once.

152
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,057
And you will be given until
sundown to remove yourself

153
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,435
and your personal belongings
from the limits of Westpoint.

154
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:22,728
Good.

155
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,778
And you can tell
Mr. Stuart for me

156
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,322
that he'd be smart
to stay in the army.

157
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,949
Right in the middle
of it from now on.

158
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,997
Cadet William Cue, Ohio.

159
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,960
Cadet Martin Evans, Ohio.

160
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,507
Cadet Arma Mallow, New Jersey.

161
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,636
Cadet George Custer, Ohio.

162
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:00,599
Cadet James Longstreet,
South Carolina.

163
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:05,020
Cadet Philip Sheridan,
New York.

164
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,317
Cadet J-E-B Stuart,
Virginia.

165
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:16,031
Cadet John Hood,
Kentucky.

166
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,994
Cadet Robert Holliday,
Kansas Territory.

167
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,247
Yippee!

168
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,462
Cadet Jason Wood,
Virginia.

169
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:35,801
Cadet George Pickett,
Virginia.

170
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:37,803
That's my sister Kit.

171
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,347
Thought two years in Boston
would make a lady out of you.

172
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,766
So did I,
it just popped out.

173
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,227
Cadet William Keel, Ohio.

174
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,731
Cadet Robert Davis,
New Jersey.

175
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:56,196
It is now my great honor
and privilege to introduce

176
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,576
the secretary of war
of the United States of America.

177
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,786
The Honorable Jefferson Davis.

178
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:11,461
Officers and gentlemen
of the class of 1854

179
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,841
their welcomed guests
and their very proud families,

180
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,968
I'll not keep you separated
very long

181
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:20,596
as I myself once
sat in your place

182
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,598
and endure an interminable
address

183
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,017
by a very tiresome general.

184
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:30,480
But as a secretary of war
of this nation

185
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,317
I have a serious obligation
towards each new officer

186
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,696
of the army before he enters
into active service.

187
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,282
And that obligation
is to make clear and definite

188
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,493
his responsibility
to his government.

189
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,788
We are a new nation among
the powers of the world.

190
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,290
Just 80 years ago

191
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,126
we were fighting desperately
for our freedom.

192
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,503
And we are still fighting
to keep it.

193
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,716
We are not yet a wealthy nation,
except in spirit.

194
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,469
And that unity of spirit
is our greatest strength.

195
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,638
You men now have but one duty.

196
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,766
One alone. America.

197
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:09,353
With your unswerving loyalty
and the grace of God

198
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,648
our nation shall have no fears
for the future.

199
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,734
And your lives will have been
spent in the noblest

200
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:19,780
of all causes, the defense
of the rights of man.

201
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:40,527
Tickets!

202
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:51,163
Tickets. Tickets.

203
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:53,415
Mr. Holliday, we're getting
close to Leavenworth.

204
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,334
Yeah, it's a shame
this tea kettle of yours

205
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,710
doesn't go any further.

206
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:59,254
What for?
There's nothing to go to.

207
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,173
There's half a nation out there,
cap.

208
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,383
Someday I'll build
a real railroad to open it up.

209
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,801
Clear the Santa Fe.

210
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,803
For a man who made
a fortune out of horses

211
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,140
you sure got a heap to learn.

212
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:12,076
Hey, cap, tell the boys to
speed it up, will you?

213
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,495
The last time I had get out and
help chop wood for the engine.

214
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,872
Well, the first time
you rode with me

215
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,064
I had to change your diapers.

216
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,527
Hey, cap, where am I going?

217
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,446
Looks like you are going
to Hades.

218
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,990
Just wanted to know.

219
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,385
Bob's been telling us about
that railroad Santa Fe so long.

220
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,969
Now, Mr. Holiday,
I'm surprised to learn

221
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:32,079
it hasn't even been built.

222
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,955
Well, let's not all foster it.

223
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,476
You can't build a railroad over
blood-soaked ground like Kansas.

224
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,043
Decent sellers won't use it.

225
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:40,545
We are losing thousands of
pioneer to Oregon Trail.

226
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,047
They circle right around us.

227
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,341
We heard about the raided
arsenal last week.

228
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,426
What is the true situation
out here, sir?

229
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,554
Well, Kansas is a territory
and not a state.

230
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,890
We are ready to join the Union,
but the big question is

231
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,518
whether we'll go in as a
slave state or as a free state.

232
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,853
On one side is most of
Kansas' pro-slavers

233
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,313
people who came from south.

234
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,832
On the other side are
the abolitionists

235
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,733
lead by John Brown
and the sons.

236
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,544
Between those two elements
they've made Kansas

237
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,654
a boiling pot of
rebellion and massacres.

238
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:07,090
That's why the army sent
you boys out here

239
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,490
to Fort Leavenworth.

240
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:12,369
Suicide station,
it's quite an honor.

241
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:15,539
- Excuse me, will you, sir?
- Surely.

242
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,833
You know, the first time
I saw you at the graduation

243
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,293
I thought of what Napoleon said
when he first met Josephine.

244
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,087
What was that?

245
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,464
He said, "I never knew this
savage land they call America

246
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,300
could breath such
perfect beauty in mortal form."

247
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,344
Oh. Thank you.

248
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,596
- That's a lovely line.
- Yeah, isn't it?

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,224
George has been using it
for years, haven't you, George?

250
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:37,561
I... I wish I could think of
nice things like that to say.

251
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:39,438
You wouldn't like
what I'm thinking now.

252
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,898
You were going to tell me
something more about Kansas.

253
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,485
Yes, what do you do on
Saturday nights for fun here?

254
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,322
Well, as I remember,
half of Leavenworth takes a bath

255
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,074
another the half gets drunk.

256
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,844
And since there are
only two bathtubs in town

257
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,661
they seem a kind of exciting
around midnight.

258
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,873
Kit! Kit! Kit.

259
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,209
By the way, how they ever came
to name you Kit Carson Holliday?

260
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,753
Well, Mr. Carson and my dad
were very good friends.

261
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,597
And they were so sure
I was going to be a boy

262
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,424
they named me
before I was born.

263
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:11,219
Oh, I see. Well, I'm certainly
glad they were wrong.

264
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,763
- Me too.
- Me too.

265
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,349
Me too!

266
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,976
- Hey, conductor.
- Yeah?

267
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:19,419
What're you going to do
about that?

268
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,148
- About what?
- I'll tend to that.

269
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,983
Hey, I thought I told you

270
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,110
them Negroes had to
ride in the last coach.

271
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,904
Their tickets gives them
the right to ride

272
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,530
wherever they please.

273
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,532
Now, I don't want any trouble
with you, mister.

274
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,451
Then you better leave us alone.

275
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:37,871
Well, I don't know what
this country is coming to.

276
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,207
- Tickets!
- Stop shaking, Anna.

277
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,666
There's nothing to worry about.

278
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,169
We're only half an hour
from the border.

279
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:46,755
If we don't hurry,
they will be across the border.

280
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,381
Alright, go ahead.

281
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,853
Where you taking the Negroes?

282
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,813
What business is that of yours?

283
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,108
We are asking the questions.
Are they free or bond?

284
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,196
Here are the papers.
You can see it for yourself.

285
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,824
Yeah, that might mean something
if we didn't know who you are.

286
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,202
Now don't you make a move.

287
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,888
We're taking
you and them off of this train

288
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,705
while they're
still in Missouri.

289
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,707
Now, come on,
get up all of you.

290
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:41,101
Where're they gonna take us,
Master Brown?

291
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,395
What they gonna do with us?

292
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,107
Stop him.

293
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,576
What do you know about this?

294
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,412
There is the trouble,
Negro slaves.

295
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,998
He was trying to sneak 'em
across the state line.

296
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,749
I'll get that murdering
jayhawker for this

297
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,127
if I'll have to hang for it.

298
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,045
- Who was it?
- Oliver Brown.

299
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,755
One of John Brown's
scurvy litter.

300
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,300
Better than a doornail.
Come on, you'll get by greenhorn

301
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,136
give me a hand. There ain't
no use spoiling the carpet.

302
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,554
Come on,
get him out of the way.

303
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,306
Now, don't get excited,
everybody.

304
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,433
Sit down, please.

305
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:24,519
This is what they mean
when call it bloody Kansas.

306
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,622
There'll never be any peace
along the Santa Fe Trail

307
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,232
while John Brown or any of his
followers are alive.

308
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,261
Now this is
the present terminal.

309
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,555
I proposed to come down here
to Wichita.

310
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,974
And along here across
the Arkansas River

311
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,685
along the Cimarron River,
over here to Las Vegas.

312
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,354
Here on into Santa Fe.

313
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,040
Now that'll be
our first section of track.

314
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,441
From Leavenworth to Wichita.
Right over the trail.

315
00:19:11,524 --> 00:19:13,068
How soon do you figure to start?

316
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,545
Well, the men back east say
they are ready

317
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,172
to put up the money as soon
as we can prove

318
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,531
that a rail route through Kansas
are safe and will pay.

319
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,742
- Dad!
- Yes, Kit.

320
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,185
Where did you put
the loading list?

321
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,121
List? Gosh, I clearly forgot
to make one out.

322
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,498
That's great!

323
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,892
Ninety eight tons
of freight ready to roll

324
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,417
and no orders for loading,

325
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,294
how'd you run this business
while I was away?

326
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,880
That's why I sent you away to
show you what a skirt was.

327
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:36,383
Look at your clothes,
look at the grease your nose.

328
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,635
What would your friends
in Boston think of you now?

329
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,387
Frankly, dad,
I don't much care.

330
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,239
If you are going to keep your
nose in the paper railway

331
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:44,391
I better keep mine
in the family affairs.

332
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,518
Tex!

333
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:48,478
Windy!

334
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,271
Tex!

335
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,773
Where are those ornery cousins?

336
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,983
What do they think they're
getting paid for?

337
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,276
Tex!

338
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,531
Why didn't you tell me?

339
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:01,241
Getting jealous, huh?

340
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:03,827
I didn't even see Lilly
when I said goodbye to her.

341
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,830
Oh, now don't start lying to me,
you double crossing buzzard.

342
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:08,516
I know that you didn't buy
that there looking glass to see

343
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,791
your own ugly mug.

344
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,185
I suppose
you're figuring on wearing

345
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,836
that female cinching belt.

346
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,796
Wait till Lilly sees
what you brung her.

347
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,131
She'll brain you.

348
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,299
If it ain't physically
impossible.

349
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,635
- Why you ignorant...
- Tex.

350
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,637
Hey, you two.
Where in the name...

351
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,097
Will you come here?

352
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,143
- Hello, Ms. Kit.
- Hello nothing.

353
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,866
Are you gentlemen of leisure
by any chance

354
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,604
interested in employment?

355
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,565
Oh, we lost our watch.

356
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:35,483
Yeah, we didn't have
no idea of time.

357
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,336
I ought to give you both your
time and throw you out.

358
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,820
Where in thunder have you been?

359
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:42,031
Well, you see,
we had to buy these nick-nacks.

360
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,368
Well, we sort of got a gal
in Santa Fe, Lilly, uh...

361
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,370
Hofstadter.
And what do you mean we?

362
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,539
- I'm engaged to her.
- Well, who ain't?

363
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,001
You set up housekeeping
at Santa Fe

364
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,086
or is this just
gilding the lily?

365
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,756
Oh, she want us to fetch her
one of them

366
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,049
fancy French
looking glasses.

367
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,551
Ain't it pretty?

368
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,511
What's your answer to that, Tex?

369
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,144
What are you all laughing at,
you long eared jackasses?

370
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,190
Go on, get to work,
both of you.

371
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,484
Go on, jump to it.

372
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,695
You better hide that thing
or start wearing it.

373
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,298
I'm going to put you
new officers

374
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:41,674
straight from the start.

375
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,469
This is Fort Leavenworth
and not Westpoint.

376
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:47,430
You were sent here
to man the frontier garrison.

377
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,391
Three of the officers
you're supposed to be replacing

378
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,895
are buried back of the hill
in the little military cemetery.

379
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,231
The other four
haven't been found yet.

380
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,150
The regiment of mounted rifles
has only one job

381
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,194
to keep the peace in Kansas.

382
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:02,695
And we're here alone.

383
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,406
There's no other fort
between us and Santa Fe.

384
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,659
And we're proud
of that responsibility.

385
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,828
We've got a tough reputation
in the army

386
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,746
but they respect us in the west.

387
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,457
See that it stays that way.

388
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,044
Order of the day, Lieutenants
Longstreet and Holliday

389
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,296
take B troop and put
them through close order drill.

390
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,757
Lieutenants Stuart and Custer
will take eight men

391
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,509
as an escort
for the freight caravan

392
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,553
leaving at noon
for New Mexico.

393
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,597
Draw the usual supplies and
report to me for final orders.

394
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,104
Say, will you keep all those

395
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:37,814
cases of Bibles
near the tail board.

396
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,190
They're only going a short haul.

397
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,818
We sure will.

398
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,194
Let's go.

399
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:51,494
Convoy ready, sir,
we're ready if you are.

400
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,288
Good, I hope you have
a nice, quiet trip.

401
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,081
On any other kind,
I lose money.

402
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,875
Oh, we will try
and save you that.

403
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,127
We'll see you in six weeks, sir,
with luck.

404
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,504
Just keep your eyes open, boys,
and move fast.

405
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,923
You'll like the scenery
but don't trust it.

406
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,174
Alright. Goodbye, sir.

407
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,801
Goodbye, Stuart.
Goodbye, Custer.

408
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,311
Corporal, detail two men
to cover each wagon.

409
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,313
Yes, sir.

410
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,982
Phil, move all these barrels
over there for the next ride.

411
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:33,536
- Well.
- Hey.

412
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,055
Looks like we both
got the same idea.

413
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,165
Looks that way.
How're we gonna work it?

414
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,376
Here.

415
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,753
I've got an idea.

416
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:44,589
- Let's draw for it.
- Fair enough.

417
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:45,965
Right.

418
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:52,263
- I got the long one.
- Hey, wait a minute.

419
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,140
Where I come from
long man loses.

420
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:57,393
Tough luck, old man.
Here, hold my horse.

421
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:01,564
One hand plough, one seater,
seven eggs, 15, 12 and 14 and...

422
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,691
Why, Joe,
there is something missing.

423
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,068
Must be me. Hello.

424
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:06,694
Hello.
What are you doing here?

425
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,297
Oh, playing nursemaid
for those wagons.

426
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,548
Should be the other way around.

427
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:11,532
Oh, the convoy.
That's a silly idea.

428
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,202
Dad, he thinks that man
John Brown is behind every bush.

429
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:15,620
Well, it's not that
I mind so much

430
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:17,014
it's being away from
you for six weeks

431
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,706
just when
we're getting started.

432
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,416
Started? When?

433
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,518
Now, look, I've only got
a few minutes left.

434
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,127
So I've got to be fast.

435
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,897
You haven't been exactly slow
for a couple of days.

436
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,231
I've never seen
such a pair of whirlwinds

437
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:27,840
as you and George Custer.

438
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,968
George, poor old George.
Well, never mind about him.

439
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,929
Look, Kit, I might as well
tell you before I go.

440
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,847
I'm completely
crazy about you.

441
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,950
- What?
- No, wait a minute.

442
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,183
Let me finish.

443
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,535
I needn't warn you
about army life.

444
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,103
The pay is bad,
I'd never be home.

445
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:42,105
You'd probably be a widow
in two weeks.

446
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,440
I see, have you thought
of any particular names

447
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,525
for the children?

448
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:47,193
No, be serious, will you?

449
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:49,213
This might be the most
precious moment in our lives.

450
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,905
I hope not,
not in these clothes.

451
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,408
Haven't you got
any heart at all?

452
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:57,078
Yes, I have, and it's going to
stay right where it is.

453
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,871
I don't know
a thing about you, Jeb Stuart.

454
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,124
My brother thinks
you're wonderful.

455
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:03,367
But then he was dropped
on his head when he was a baby.

456
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:08,006
Well, at least you'll let me
kiss you goodbye, won't you?

457
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,051
Oh, well, it's quite an honor,
but no, thanks.

458
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,053
I... I don't really deserve it.

459
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,098
Well, hello.
Say, this is quite a surprise.

460
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,951
The corporal's looking for you,
says it's very urgent.

461
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,476
Mm-hmm, I'll bet.

462
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,621
Kit, we will take this up later
right where we left off.

463
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,355
Now, George,
don't be long winded.

464
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,291
Listen, Kit, we're due to
leave in a minute now.

465
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:28,109
There's something
I've got to tell you.

466
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:29,944
I'm head over heels in love
with you.

467
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,488
George, you sound just
like an echo.

468
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,699
Oh, Kit. Ah, pardon the
interruption, George old man.

469
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:36,093
Kit, there is something
I forgot to ask you.

470
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,827
Have I got any real competition?

471
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,722
How do you think any girl would
answer a question like this?

472
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,081
- Well, just tell me the truth.
- Then you'd both be crazy.

473
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,167
Get going, you bull whackers!

474
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,085
Through desert heat and dust

475
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,212
your throats will soon
be choking.

476
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,214
S Your head's about to bust.

477
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,175
No water when you're thirsty.

478
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,135
And all you get to eat.

479
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,680
Is aromatic antelope
and some big buffalo meat

480
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,475
Yippy-aye.

481
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,185
Good luck, boys.

482
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:05,271
We may not even
live to get our pay.

483
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:07,815
But even if
we don't get paid.

484
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,817
There ain't no job we trade.

485
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,819
For hauling freight
from state to state.

486
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,780
Along the Santa Fe.

487
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,215
For hauling freight
from state to state.

488
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,241
Along the Santa Fe

489
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,243
Yippy-aye.

490
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,370
Aye-yay.

491
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,957
There's trouble riding with us
all the way.

492
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,793
You'll think over
what I said, Kit?

493
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,712
Every word.
Take care of yourself, George.

494
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,798
Don't worry about that.
Goodbye, darling.

495
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,299
Along the Santa Fe

496
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,009
Yippy-aye.

497
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,053
Aye-yay.

498
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:40,556
There's trouble riding with us
all the way.

499
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,059
Although we sweat and whine
and cuss.

500
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:44,811
The only job for us.

501
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,230
Is hauling freight
from state to state...

502
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:50,191
- Wanna make a little bet, Kit?
- Sure, on what?

503
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:51,859
Those two boys.

504
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,612
I'll give you a three to one
I can name the winner.

505
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:56,155
That's ridiculous.

506
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:00,368
Which one do you want?

507
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,501
- I'll take that bet.
- Good!

508
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:10,586
Is hauling freight
from state to state.

509
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,089
Along the Santa Fe.

510
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,057
And to instruct
to all volunteers

511
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,809
not to enter Kansas unequipped.

512
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:27,812
Nor to display their weapons
to public view.

513
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:30,314
Let that be understood
beforehand.

514
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,150
- Warn them also...
- Not so fast, father.

515
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,068
Warn them also
that our plans must be known

516
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,237
to ourselves alone.

517
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,948
That they join me in the clear
knowledge that all traitors

518
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:41,159
of the cause must die

519
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,662
wherever caught
and proven to be guilty.

520
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:46,181
Tell them that we stand by
one another

521
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:47,707
while a drop of blood remains.

522
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,793
That under no threats or
pressure do we make confessions.

523
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,051
Alright, that's our camp.

524
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,863
I might as well tell you
when you get this far

525
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,221
you don't turn back.

526
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,806
You don't have to
worry about us.

527
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,641
We ain't the kind that quit.

528
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,810
That's fine.
Just see you keep it that way.

529
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,396
Save all of us
a lot of unpleasantness.

530
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,698
You've been delayed.
Was there trouble, Rader?

531
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:23,034
No, sir, we had to detour
when we got to the border.

532
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,244
I picked these new men
up in Palmyra.

533
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,164
Volunteers, sir.
Here are their credentials.

534
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:30,666
From Illinois.
You've come a long way.

535
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,711
And we'll go the rest of it.
We came here to fight slavers.

536
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:36,422
- The sooner the better.
- That's good.

537
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:38,674
We'll put you to work at once.

538
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,593
Kitzmiller,
look after these gentlemen.

539
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:42,261
Fine.
This way, boys.

540
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,266
We've received the news
we've been waiting for.

541
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,894
- We break camp, Rader.
- Yes, sir!

542
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,646
Let's start tearing down
these tents now.

543
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,488
Oliver! He's hurt.

544
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,865
- I'm alright. Where's father?
- Father!

545
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,787
What has happened to you?

546
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,473
Where are the Negroes
you were told to bring?

547
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,791
A couple of pro-slavers tried
to grab us on the train.

548
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,501
I shot one of 'em
and jumped off.

549
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:16,170
You left four helpless people
alone to save yourself?

550
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,214
I had to do it, father.
It was me or them.

551
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:19,882
You cowardly fool!

552
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,221
In future
obey my instructions.

553
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:26,806
We leave at once.

554
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:36,148
All of you,
down upon your knees.

555
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,570
As once you sent the ravens
to save Elijah

556
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,864
so how you have delivered
into my hands

557
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,618
the precious means
of continuing Thy holy work.

558
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,413
The Lord
our God is a great God

559
00:29:50,496 --> 00:29:52,957
a mighty and a terrible
who regardth not persons

560
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,501
nor taketh reward.

561
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,795
The Lord is a man of war.

562
00:29:57,878 --> 00:30:01,632
Thy right hand shall become
glorious through power.

563
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,219
Thy right hand, oh, God shall
dash in pieces the enemy.

564
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,146
Hey, Oscar.

565
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,207
When we cross the river
you watch out for that wagon.

566
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:19,025
It's got my looking glass.

567
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,585
Hey, Tex.
These horses are pretty tired.

568
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:21,849
When are we going to make camp?

569
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:23,404
Oh, as soon as
we cross the river

570
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,299
and then we'll be out of danger
from both sides.

571
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,550
You know, lieutenant,
I'm sure glad

572
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,159
we're leaving civilization.

573
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:30,786
It's getting too dangerous
for a peace-loving man.

574
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,997
I run into some of
them abolitionists this once.

575
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,791
But who's this fella John Brown
they talk so much about?

576
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,169
Oh, as far as I know
he's just a dirty old windbag.

577
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:42,006
- In fact, he's just your type.
- Either of you ever meet him?

578
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,192
No, but two of them fellas
he killed at Osawatomie

579
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:45,509
were friends of mine.

580
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,219
You mean Jim Doyle
and Allan Wilkerson?

581
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,947
Yeah, and that's the reason
I'd sure like to meet up

582
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,723
with this here Mr. John Brown.

583
00:30:50,806 --> 00:30:53,059
He's got no quarrel
with people like you, Tex.

584
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,311
You would do much better
to leave him alone.

585
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,271
Well, you can
count me in anyhow.

586
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,398
Even if he ain't harm
no friends of mine

587
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,609
I sure would hate to miss
a good fight.

588
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:17,541
This is wrong, father.

589
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,877
We've never attacked
a wagon train before.

590
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,879
We aren't common highwaymen.

591
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:23,547
You say we have
a righteous cause

592
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,841
but this will bring the law
down on us like a storm.

593
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,761
We recognize no law
but the law of God.

594
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,429
You will do as I command.

595
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,483
Take your men back, Rader.
Wait for my signal.

596
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,430
Howdy, strangers.

597
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,265
Good morning.
Are these Holliday's wagons?

598
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:16,267
- That's right, sir.
- My name is Smith.

599
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,977
Jonathan Smith of Newton.

600
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,979
Ah, well,
what can we do for you?

601
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:22,648
I believe you're carrying
some freight consigned to me.

602
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:24,751
Oh, we might be, if you got
something to show for it.

603
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:27,820
I have this receipt
from the shipper.

604
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:30,132
Come a long way with an empty
wagon, haven't you, Mr. Smith?

605
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,991
Newton's about
a 100 miles from here.

606
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:34,326
My home is in Newton, sir,
but my place of business

607
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,245
is much closer to the trail.

608
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:37,830
Oh, I see.

609
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,665
I thought your horses
look pretty fresh.

610
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:42,084
Eight cases of Bibles.
That's right.

611
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,837
Come on, Windy, we will unpack
these Bibles for the parson.

612
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,047
Jason, bring up your wagon.

613
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,846
Get that cart down.

614
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:55,031
I got to get them Bibles
unpacked

615
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:58,017
for the parson.

616
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,853
That's a funny thing.
I've seen that fella somewhere.

617
00:33:00,936 --> 00:33:02,980
It's the way it seems to me.

618
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:04,666
It isn't the kind of a face
you'd forget in a hurry.

619
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,109
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

620
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,820
I know. In some magazine,
"The Atlantic” I think.

621
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,364
Well, and he's either from
Boston or he's a missionary.

622
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,868
No, it was something else.

623
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:22,708
Been a lot of bad trouble

624
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,252
over across the river lately,
Mr. Smith.

625
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,755
That murdering skunk John Brown
is on the loose again.

626
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:29,298
Better keep your eye
peeled for him.

627
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:31,008
Thank you. We shall.

628
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:35,721
This stuff sure is heavy
for Bibles.

629
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:38,349
How would you know?
You ain't never even saw one.

630
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,244
Just a minute.

631
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,415
I'd like to see
those Bibles.

632
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,792
Stay where you are.

633
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,835
Put your hands up
and keep 'em up.

634
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,082
I advise you to make
no move towards your gun.

635
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:46,709
Bring up the other wagon.

636
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,669
Now then, quickly
with those other crates.

637
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,217
Alright, get a move on there.
Only the ones marked Bibles.

638
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,803
Hey, Jeb. Look.

639
00:34:57,886 --> 00:34:59,346
Our friend Rader.

640
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,811
Well, this is a surprise.

641
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:07,980
The commission
and the cavalry too, huh?

642
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,613
I see you've got the commission
you were after.

643
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,152
You know these men, Rader?

644
00:35:13,235 --> 00:35:14,903
Yes, sir. Very well.

645
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,405
This one, Stuart,
comes from a rich

646
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:18,741
slave owning family
in Virginia.

647
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:23,037
He called you a lying renegade
once and I jumped him for it.

648
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,580
John Brown. Him?

649
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,081
- John Brown!
- John Brown?

650
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,833
I've nothing personal
against you men

651
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,127
but I will deal harshly
with any interference.

652
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,524
I might have known that you'd
wind up with this outfit.

653
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:36,109
Well, that's one of the troubles
with the army, Stuart,

654
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,926
they don't teach you
to think ahead.

655
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,386
They do one smart thing.

656
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,947
They teach never to turn
your back on an enemy

657
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:42,598
without first making sure
he's harm...

658
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,685
Stop this.

659
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,079
We've not saddled ourselves
with the killing

660
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:50,356
just to satisfy
your personal quarrels.

661
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,039
One more murder
won't mark you any deeper

662
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,192
than you are now, Mr. Brown.

663
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,736
I intend to be a marked man.

664
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,030
Back to your horse, Rader.

665
00:35:58,113 --> 00:35:59,657
Back to your horses,
all of you.

666
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,408
I've given you fair warning.

667
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,870
You can keep your heads
or lose them as you wish.

668
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:06,205
Move on.

669
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,778
I saw what was
in those cases, George.

670
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,011
- What?
- Contraband.

671
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,180
- Riffles and ammunition.
- Gosh!

672
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:25,766
Then we've been delivering
Bibles with triggers on 'em.

673
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,267
Let's take a chance.

674
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,561
Everybody take cover
and open fire.

675
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,522
Dismount! Take cover!

676
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,536
Stop! Cover the wagons
and move back.

677
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,995
We mustn't lose anymore men.

678
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:51,542
Get back.

679
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,961
He's running.
They're getting away.

680
00:36:54,044 --> 00:36:55,671
No, they are not.
We're going after them.

681
00:36:55,754 --> 00:36:57,754
Hey, wait a minute.
They outnumber us three to one.

682
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,134
Well, if it makes you nervous,
don't count them. Come on.

683
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:04,304
Everybody, mount and follow me.

684
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,973
Everybody, mount!

685
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,354
Come on. I tell you,
here's where I get your medal.

686
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,605
Forward!

687
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,029
Get those wagons out of here!

688
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,490
Come on! Quickly!

689
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,628
Use your whip, Jason!
Use your whip!

690
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,469
I couldn't help it.
I didn't do anything.

691
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,513
Alright, son,
nobody's going to hurt you.

692
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:12,140
- Who are you?
- Jason Brown.

693
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,809
Brown? You're one of
John Brown's sons.

694
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:16,228
Yeah.
Yes, but I never did anything.

695
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,896
He made me go along.

696
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,357
I never killed anyone.
I swear it.

697
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,193
I'm getting out.
I'm quitting.

698
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,778
You've got to take me with you.

699
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,072
Alright.
Bring a horse up, George.

700
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:29,366
- Bring up the horses.
- We'll have to carry him back.

701
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,787
The boy is badly hurt.

702
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,957
It's his father's madness
really striking home now.

703
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,418
Jeb, there's a purpose
behind that madness.

704
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,753
One that can't easily
be dismissed.

705
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:47,259
George, you've seen the needle
on a compass, haven't you?

706
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:48,969
It's got a whole car
to swing around in

707
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,346
but it always wobbles
back to the North.

708
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,265
What are you driving at?

709
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:55,809
Just this. I've always known
where your sympathies lay,

710
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,729
but it never affected our
friendship and it never will.

711
00:39:58,812 --> 00:40:00,814
But it isn't our job
to decide who's right

712
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,066
and who's wrong about slavery

713
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,860
anymore than it is John Brown's.

714
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,364
I guess you're right, Jeb.

715
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,574
I'm sorry.

716
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,827
That's the most doggone fun
I've had

717
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,787
since we got hemmed up
with them Injuns.

718
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,557
Yeah, well, the next time
we shooting at a commoner

719
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,957
you let me do the shooting.

720
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,335
Boy, my gullet is dry as
a powder horn.

721
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:27,633
Get up.

722
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:33,055
You busted Lilly's
looking glass.

723
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:34,431
When she looks
at herself in that

724
00:40:34,514 --> 00:40:36,600
she'll think
she's a hundred years old.

725
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:37,935
Or more.

726
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:40,979
Of course, we're aware that

727
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,606
firearms are contraband
in Kansas.

728
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,626
Do you think we'd have
accepted those boxes as freight

729
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,294
if we'd known
what they actually contained?

730
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,320
Well, I'm just asking,
that's all.

731
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:51,198
Doesn't it seem strange to you
that Dr. J. Boyce Russell,

732
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,081
the most prominent
religious leader in America

733
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:56,578
should be sending rifles
marked as Bibles to John Brown?

734
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,789
How can I control
the marking of crates?

735
00:40:58,872 --> 00:41:01,541
We once received three tons
of gunpowder marked bird seed.

736
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,794
Well, then you'll have to
examine every crate you haul.

737
00:41:03,877 --> 00:41:04,878
What?

738
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,338
For all we know this contraband

739
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:08,215
may have been slipping
through for months.

740
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:11,051
Jason. Listen, son.

741
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:14,346
You've got nothing to be afraid
of if you'll be honest with us.

742
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,932
Now, I want you to answer
my question truthfully.

743
00:41:17,015 --> 00:41:19,035
Did your father ever mentioned
this shipment of rifles

744
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,477
when he discussed his plans?

745
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,688
Not to me.

746
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,273
He never confided in me.

747
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,567
Just Fred and Oliver.

748
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,862
- Fred and Oliver?
- My brothers.

749
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:34,324
- Where are their headquarters?
- I don't know where they went.

750
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:37,953
They have a dozen places, I...

751
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,789
I don't know.
I don't know.

752
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:44,668
Alright, kid.

753
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,211
Don't worry about it.

754
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:58,056
These guns are no
mistake.

755
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,617
Anyone with their best
interest of Kansas

756
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:01,184
at heart can tell you that.

757
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,662
No bendy-legged
bushwhacking soldier

758
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,479
can talk like that
about the Holidays.

759
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,915
We've got as much
interest in Kansas

760
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:07,125
as the United States government.

761
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,608
And a darn sight
more investment.

762
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,110
We were here before
the army came in

763
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,279
and by God we will be here
when you're gone.

764
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:14,281
If you think you can...

765
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:15,615
Sir.

766
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,409
Well, Stuart,
what did you find?

767
00:42:17,492 --> 00:42:18,492
Very little, sir.

768
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,554
The boy is either too badly hurt

769
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,204
or too frightened to talk.

770
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,224
We leave immediately.
Have them sound to assembly.

771
00:42:23,248 --> 00:42:24,249
Yes, sir.

772
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,171
What was that you called me?

773
00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:31,298
A gold darn
bendy-legged bushwhacker.

774
00:42:31,381 --> 00:42:32,758
Now, go on.

775
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,719
He says he talks
with God at night.

776
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:40,015
But God doesn't tell people to
kill one another, does He, miss?

777
00:42:43,268 --> 00:42:48,148
He's a, he's a good man
in a lot of ways.

778
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:51,234
But he's changed
since Osawatomie.

779
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,571
Those people he killed...

780
00:42:54,654 --> 00:42:56,615
They got down on their knees

781
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:59,409
and begged him for their lives.

782
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,162
But he struck them with a sword.

783
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:05,248
Him and Rader and Kitzmiller.

784
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,209
I was there.

785
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,919
I saw it done.

786
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:12,631
I tried to stop them
but they pushed me aside.

787
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:15,258
Yes, that's how it was.

788
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,802
We're starting at once.

789
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,804
I'll take the first troop
west to Tecumseh.

790
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,973
Stuart, you and Custer will take
the first platoon of B troop

791
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,517
and search thoroughly
from Clinton

792
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,310
to Dutch Henry's crossing.
Is that clear?

793
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:27,479
- Yes, sir.
- These are your orders.

794
00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:30,065
Find John Brown
and bring him back here.

795
00:43:30,148 --> 00:43:31,691
Alive if possible.

796
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,361
His force is well-armed now
and strong in numbers.

797
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,113
We also suspect
that new volunteers

798
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,240
are drifting in from the East
to join him.

799
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:39,683
Be on the lookout
for them as well.

800
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:42,536
Retire to your
respective troops.

801
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,291
What's that?

802
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,793
They've caught
some more of us.

803
00:43:49,876 --> 00:43:52,879
No one's been caught, Jason.
Not even you.

804
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,090
You've committed no crime
to be afraid of.

805
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:57,217
I'm sick of being afraid.

806
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,761
I'm sick of hiding
like a hunted thing.

807
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,429
I want to walk free
like other people.

808
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,764
You will, Jason.

809
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,225
- You are safe now.
- No, I'm not.

810
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:09,187
Not as long as he keeps killing
and thinking that he's right.

811
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,439
He can't be right,
can he, miss?

812
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,859
I don't know.

813
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,611
His reasons may be right, Jason.

814
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,781
They may even be great
and good reasons.

815
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,994
But what your father is doing
is wrong, terribly wrong.

816
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:28,456
And he will keep on repeating
that wrong as long as he lives.

817
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,752
Then, then I'll never
be free of him

818
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,923
until one of us is dead.
I know that now.

819
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,801
My life don't mean anything.

820
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,137
But if he dies

821
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,598
maybe this whole scheme of his
will die with him.

822
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:47,184
I'd rather have it that way.

823
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,603
His life...

824
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,688
Even if he is my father

825
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:53,273
against many thousands.

826
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:57,152
I'm going to tell you
where to find him.

827
00:44:57,235 --> 00:44:58,337
Well, Jason,
I'm not trying to...

828
00:44:58,361 --> 00:44:59,654
I'm going to tell you anyway.

829
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:02,115
In the house
of Shubel Morgan, Palmyra.

830
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,617
That's where they went.

831
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,536
That's their headquarters.
Tell the soldiers!

832
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,290
It's better that way.

833
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:13,835
His life against many thousands.

834
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:29,809
Jeb.

835
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,061
Hello, darling. How is he?

836
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:32,145
It's very serious.

837
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,813
I left the doctor with him.

838
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,149
- Poor little devil.
- Jeb, he told me everything.

839
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,026
The whole nightmare
of his 15 years

840
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,736
even the place
where his father is now.

841
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:41,780
He said he wanted me
to tell the soldiers.

842
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:43,281
- Where?
- Palmyra.

843
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,367
At the house of
a man named Shubel Morgan.

844
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,744
Shubel Morgan, Palmyra.

845
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:52,999
- I wonder if that's the truth.
- Jeb. I'm frightened.

846
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,502
That boy is crippled for life.

847
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:59,422
And that man on the train,
he died for principle.

848
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,008
And a man killed him
for a principle.

849
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,928
One of them is wrong.
But which one?

850
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:06,638
Who knows the answer
to that, Kit.

851
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,682
Everybody in America
is trying to decide it.

852
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,643
Yes, by words in the East
and by guns in the West.

853
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:14,479
But one day the words
will turn into guns.

854
00:46:14,562 --> 00:46:16,815
Oh, Jeb, can't it be
stopped now?

855
00:46:16,898 --> 00:46:19,150
Can't the slaves be free
before it's too late?

856
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,279
It will be stopped
when we hang John Brown.

857
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,114
Then the South can settle
our own problem

858
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:25,758
without loss of pride
at being forced into it

859
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,367
by a bunch of fanatics.

860
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,287
Oh, Jeb, what has pride
got to do with human lives?

861
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,833
Kit, the two things kind of
come together down South.

862
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,127
We can't pry them apart.
Not even with guns.

863
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:41,715
I hope that's going to be
the same way with us.

864
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,514
Uh-oh, that's me all over.
Clumsy Cluster.

865
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:50,677
Or can I get into this too?

866
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,142
- Yes.
- Sure, sure.

867
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,394
It's like you're not.
Don't miss much, do you?

868
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:57,022
Ah, I've seen your work before,
son. That's where I learned.

869
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,024
That's credit one more
to my account, Kit.

870
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,443
I would like to let
the interest accumulate.

871
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:03,778
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye, George.

872
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:07,449
Hear that?

873
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,117
- Don't be long, Jeb.
- Oh, no, no, no.

874
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,494
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

875
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,456
Kit, remember this, will you?
I love you.

876
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:15,933
Put that in your little bonnet
and keep it there

877
00:47:15,957 --> 00:47:17,167
until I come back.

878
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,960
- I'll remember.
- Goodbye.

879
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:25,884
Hey, lieutenant.

880
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:27,802
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Lieutenant Jeb.

881
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,030
Say, I want you to keep
an eye on Kit for me

882
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,597
while we're gone, will you?

883
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,640
No. We're going to hunting
John Brown with you.

884
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,909
- What?
- Yeah, we've come to join up.

885
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:35,518
Who do we see?

886
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,771
A couple of flat-footed rumpots
like you in the army?

887
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,397
Why, you would get lost.

888
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,481
Boys, you better go home
and sleep it off. So long.

889
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:08,009
Jeb. Jeb!

890
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,351
Jeb!

891
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,107
He's dead.

892
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,986
If you find John Brown,
tell him.

893
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:31,074
We'll try to find him.
Goodbye.

894
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,428
Kit, once when you were
about this high

895
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:55,014
Tex and Windy brought home
a wolf cub with a broken back.

896
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,558
You nursed it for weeks

897
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,394
but it finally died
with his head in your lap.

898
00:48:59,477 --> 00:49:01,312
You cried for days.

899
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,231
But it was just a wolf cub.

900
00:49:03,314 --> 00:49:06,818
It would probably have grown up
to be a killer like its father.

901
00:49:19,497 --> 00:49:22,375
What does being flat-footed
got to do with riding a horse?

902
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,836
Calling me a rumpot
is what hurt me.

903
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:26,463
I ain't had a drink
since noon.

904
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:51,696
Alright, get the sledge.

905
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,587
It sure is expensive salt pork,
Mr. Morgan sir.

906
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,088
Not the way we get 'em.

907
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,274
Round 'em over
and stack 'em in the barn.

908
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,508
Yes, sir.

909
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,610
This looks like
the best shipment

910
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,344
we've had yet.

911
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:16,054
Wonder what Rader's
worked up about?

912
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:17,781
Him and the old man
been arguing for an hour.

913
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:20,767
Looks like another job for us
if Rader thought of it.

914
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:23,311
West born education
is a wonderful thing.

915
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:24,646
Yeah, if you can collect on it.

916
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:26,147
Yeah.

917
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,942
I signed up because
you promised to pay me.

918
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,777
Train this rabble gang of yours

919
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,030
into a solid fast moving
unit of fighters.

920
00:50:34,113 --> 00:50:36,574
Taught 'em how to use these new
rifles, how to follow orders

921
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,077
and take a town
in army fashion.

922
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,746
But I haven't received
a red cent in three months.

923
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:44,123
Now, what about it?

924
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,668
Mr. Rader, I enlisted you
on the recommendation

925
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:49,879
of friends in the East, who said
you would work for the cause.

926
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,341
You've done the job well.
I've no complaint up to now.

927
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:56,261
But our plans are ahead
of any personal greed.

928
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,721
If you feel otherwise,
you are free to get out.

929
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,224
But you must decide
here and now.

930
00:51:01,307 --> 00:51:03,226
I want only loyal men
around me.

931
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,568
You've no argument
with my loyalty.

932
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,944
I proved that in Osawatomie

933
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:15,113
and every other town
we've raided.

934
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:17,699
But you hired me as a
military expert at a set price

935
00:51:17,782 --> 00:51:19,867
and I'm only asking
what's rightly due me.

936
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,495
And I say that
you'll receive it in time.

937
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,747
Only let me think in peace.

938
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,166
My son is a prisoner
in the hands of our enemies.

939
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,919
Even now he may have
a rope around his neck.

940
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:33,673
An innocent boy who never fired
a gun in anger in his life.

941
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:37,760
While I stand here
powerless to save him.

942
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,887
Alright, I'll wait.

943
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,639
Well, what's our next move?

944
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,482
The Bible has said, "An eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth."

945
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,819
Tomorrow at daybreak we will
destroy Delaware crossing.

946
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:13,046
Jeb!

947
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,715
Lieutenant Jeb!

948
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,133
Troop, halt.

949
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,014
Well, what the...

950
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:24,807
Well, the major sort of
turned us down too.

951
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,851
But here we are,
Lieutenant Jeb.

952
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:29,062
What do you mean trailing us
halfway across Kansas?

953
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,688
We don't want you to get lost.

954
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,541
You see, I know every wrinkle
of this here country

955
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:33,941
just like my own face.

956
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,502
Well, you're sure
that's just as dirty?

957
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:37,129
I've got a good mind
to get a couple of mules

958
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,405
and strap you on the back
and send you home.

959
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,158
A fine looking
pair of soldiers you make.

960
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:44,535
Well, we needed some of them
pants and a cap.

961
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,971
And then of course
there's some soldiers

962
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:48,706
just our size gets killed,
why...

963
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,125
Alright, get back
to the end of the column.

964
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,835
Go on before I get that mule.

965
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,146
We don't have to obey no orders.

966
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,422
Since we ain't in the army.

967
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,882
- But we will.
- Yeah.

968
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,806
Wait till Kit hear about this.
She'll skin 'em alive.

969
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,808
That's if they've got
any skin left.

970
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,612
Who did this?

971
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,364
John Brown.

972
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:06,659
How many men did he have
with him?

973
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,579
Around a hundred.
Maybe more.

974
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:14,041
- How long since he left?
- Three, four hours.

975
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,836
We lost count of time.

976
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,272
Oh, you're the man
that had the run in

977
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,882
with one of the Browns
on the train.

978
00:54:20,965 --> 00:54:23,384
- Is this in revenge for that?
- Yes.

979
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,428
We're Free Staters here.

980
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:27,722
Brown always knew
we'd get him some day

981
00:54:27,805 --> 00:54:30,725
if he didn't get us first.

982
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:33,728
Well, I'll leave you some men
to help you bury your dead.

983
00:54:33,811 --> 00:54:34,955
Let's see you back
to Leavenworth.

984
00:54:34,979 --> 00:54:36,439
We don't want any help.

985
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:37,982
This is our fight.

986
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:41,486
We don't want you
or nobody else to finish it.

987
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:44,197
I'm going to take care
of John Brown myself.

988
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,325
Get on your way, soldier.
We've got work to do.

989
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:50,161
I know how you men
must feel about this.

990
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:52,455
But my orders are to break up
all armed forces.

991
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:55,208
Yours, John Brown's,
or anyone else's.

992
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,210
I'm sorry, but if you organize
under arms

993
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,378
I won't be able to draw a line
between you.

994
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,214
That suits us.

995
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,090
If it's got to be.

996
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,737
What did you find out,
Kitzmiller?

997
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,573
A tube of cavalry from Fort
Leavenworth are headed this way.

998
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,909
Ignorant fools!

999
00:55:29,992 --> 00:55:32,286
Shubel, we're moving camp.
Round up all your men.

1000
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,664
Get the wagons ready to roll.
Just food and ammunition.

1001
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:36,227
We're traveling light
and moving fast.

1002
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,043
What about the Negroes?
We can't take all of them.

1003
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:40,545
We're not taking any of 'em.

1004
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,653
My children,
the hour of deliverance

1005
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:07,989
I promised you has come.

1006
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:11,534
I'm leaving Kansas now
to continue God's holy work.

1007
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:17,373
"So Gideon took ten men
of his servants

1008
00:56:17,456 --> 00:56:20,251
"and did as God
had said unto him.

1009
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:22,044
"And it was so
he did it by night

1010
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,381
"and when the men of the wicked
city arose early in the morning

1011
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:28,926
behold, the altar of Baal
was cast down."

1012
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,929
Please, Captain Brown.
What do that mean?

1013
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,682
- What you gonna do with us?
- It means that you are free.

1014
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:36,851
The first of many millions
to whom I shall

1015
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:38,853
give freedom from slavery.

1016
00:56:38,936 --> 00:56:42,398
Does, does just saying so
make us free?

1017
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:45,610
How we gonna live?
Get food and shelter?

1018
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,987
There are many good people
in Kansas who will give you

1019
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,072
work and protection.

1020
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,700
From now on,
you must fend for yourselves

1021
00:56:52,783 --> 00:56:54,702
as other free men do.

1022
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,622
My work here is done.

1023
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,459
- Praise the lord!
- Glory bliss! God, we's free.

1024
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:03,753
The captain done tip his word,
we's free!

1025
00:57:03,836 --> 00:57:05,838
We's free! We's free!

1026
00:57:19,977 --> 00:57:21,687
You know,
if John Brown is a 100 men

1027
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,357
we better send a runner back,
bring up the rest of the troop.

1028
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,734
Better do it tonight.

1029
00:57:26,817 --> 00:57:28,319
I'm going into Palmyra,
George.

1030
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:30,863
You, alone?
Don't be crazy, Jeb.

1031
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,783
That town's full of jayhawkers,
they'd shoot you on sight.

1032
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:35,660
Well, I'll have to take
a chance on that.

1033
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,554
I'm gonna get some other
clothes, take a couple of men

1034
00:57:37,578 --> 00:57:39,580
and go in
and do some scouting.

1035
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,904
I'll try to send you back word.

1036
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,585
Good luck.

1037
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,521
Say, do you two fellows
still want to join the army?

1038
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:48,005
I've got a job for you.

1039
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,632
It's no picnic,
it's pretty dangerous.

1040
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,134
But I think you're the fellows
for it. What do you say?

1041
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,470
Do you mean we're gonna have
a real cap and a uniform?

1042
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,240
Well, we might have to be buried
in 'em.

1043
00:57:57,264 --> 00:57:59,183
But it sure sounds like a deal.

1044
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,702
The law has got nothing
to do with it.

1045
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,079
We came here to join John Brown

1046
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:22,623
because he's a leader,
and a fighter!

1047
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:26,043
The whole thing's going to be
settled right here in Kansas.

1048
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,754
We came here to fight slavers,
didn't we?

1049
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,967
The only way to fight 'em
is with guns!

1050
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,386
Sure give a good lookin' over
in this here's man town.

1051
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:38,264
Yeah, I feel just like I was
takin' a bath in a bath tub

1052
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:39,640
without no sides on it.

1053
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,059
The only kind of a tub
you ever was in.

1054
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,870
Say, who could I talk to
in this kind of a town

1055
00:58:43,894 --> 00:58:45,813
without arising suspicion?

1056
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,024
- The town barber.
- That's right.

1057
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,067
Anytime a barber can't talk
to a stranger

1058
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,028
he's liable to go crazy.

1059
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,488
The town barber. Hm.

1060
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,115
That's it.

1061
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:06,667
- Howdy, boys.
- Howdy.

1062
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,259
Pretty good looking horse
for this part of the world.

1063
00:59:15,342 --> 00:59:16,635
Yeah.

1064
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,471
Kansas is alright
for men and dogs

1065
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,681
but it's pretty hard
on women and horses.

1066
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,852
Say, look at that brand.

1067
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,442
That's an army horse.

1068
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,697
Maybe just bought him
from someone.

1069
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,991
No, they don't sell 'em.

1070
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,035
Nobody rides that brand
but a soldier.

1071
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:44,914
You keep your eye on him
till I get back.

1072
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,837
You still got that creepy
feeling about this place?

1073
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,964
I don't know whether it's that
or here chiggers.

1074
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,133
But something's creeping
over me.

1075
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,135
Why don't you scratch
and see if it goes away.

1076
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:07,311
Yeah, I reckon
that is all it was.

1077
01:00:07,394 --> 01:00:08,979
Say, I got it now.

1078
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,903
We was on the same train
a couple of months ago

1079
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,608
when that fellow got killed.

1080
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:14,836
Uh-huh. You probably got me
mixed up with somebody else.

1081
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,279
No siree.
I never forget a face.

1082
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,882
Although,
I was little drunk at the time.

1083
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,282
Well, there you are.

1084
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:22,618
The fellow you saw
probably had two faces.

1085
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:25,037
- Been in Palmyra long?
- Oh, just a couple of weeks.

1086
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,580
This ain't no town for barbers.

1087
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,266
The fellows that ain't trying to
hide their faces

1088
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:31,335
for some reason or other
are too mean to spend the money.

1089
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:33,647
Yes, I've heard you got some
pretty tough customers here.

1090
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,173
Tough? Say! I'm afraid
to shave half of them.

1091
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,008
Afraid they'll get up
and cut my throat.

1092
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,928
Say, do you ever run
across this famous...

1093
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:44,306
- What's his name, John Brown?
- Sure, he came in here once.

1094
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,392
Strange looking man,
with a hit mark on his throat.

1095
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:47,726
Hit mark? What's that?

1096
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,937
Oh, it's an old barber
superstition.

1097
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,690
A little red line that runs
all the way around here.

1098
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:55,359
Anybody born with that mark
is bound to be hung.

1099
01:00:55,442 --> 01:00:56,819
That so?

1100
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:59,155
Say, I haven't got one, have I?

1101
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,448
Not yet. Maybe.

1102
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,039
Well, well.

1103
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,875
Keep your hand away.

1104
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,210
Get it.

1105
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,385
This was quite an idea, Stuart.

1106
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:23,637
You coming in alone first
to look around.

1107
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:27,224
Is this one of your agents?

1108
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,809
I ain't never laid eyes
on him before.

1109
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,437
I swear it.
I-I don't know him from Adam.

1110
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,981
What were you up to?

1111
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:36,066
Well, it's your move.
You figure it out.

1112
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,028
My next move is plain enough.

1113
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,696
Didn't they teach us
how to handle spies

1114
01:01:40,779 --> 01:01:42,323
when we caught 'em red-handed?

1115
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:44,116
Same treatment for renegades,
wasn't it?

1116
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,535
When you catch 'em.

1117
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,370
This will make you quite a hero,
Stuart.

1118
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:52,249
The class of '54 will turn out
in a body for your funeral.

1119
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,710
They may even hang your picture
in the West Point Library.

1120
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:56,587
There's worst places to hang.

1121
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:59,173
Get him out of here, Rader.
We're wasting time.

1122
01:01:59,256 --> 01:02:03,052
Just having a last few words
with an old classmate of mine.

1123
01:02:03,135 --> 01:02:05,179
And I had them coming to me.

1124
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,893
Come on, get up.

1125
01:02:10,976 --> 01:02:13,771
We're gonna give you a good look
at what you came to see.

1126
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,245
We can't afford
to take chances, sir.

1127
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,956
He was sent here as a spy. It's
my advice to get rid of him.

1128
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,583
- Let's string him up.
- Goddamn right.

1129
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:38,212
What did you hope to achieve
by coming alone to Palmyra?

1130
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:39,755
The army has orders
from Washington

1131
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:41,382
to bring you to trial.

1132
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:43,509
I hoped that if I came
face to face with you first

1133
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:45,594
a lot of unnecessary bloodshed
might be avoided

1134
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,096
for your men and mine.

1135
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:48,782
Were you innocent enough
to think that I would

1136
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:51,350
surrender myself to you
without a fight?

1137
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:53,018
I hope that you might
consider yourself

1138
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,895
innocent enough to do that.

1139
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,356
Half of the people in America
believe in your theory.

1140
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:59,233
A lot of them even condone
your methods.

1141
01:02:59,316 --> 01:03:01,110
That'll guarantee you
a public trial.

1142
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:03,112
Fool.

1143
01:03:03,195 --> 01:03:06,490
I'm not on trial,
but the nation itself.

1144
01:03:06,573 --> 01:03:10,786
Are you too stupid and blinded
by a uniform to see what I see?

1145
01:03:10,869 --> 01:03:14,623
A dark and evil curse
laying all over this land.

1146
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,710
A carnal sin against God.

1147
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:19,295
It can only be wiped out
in blood.

1148
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,088
But why in blood?

1149
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:23,108
The people of the Virginia
have considered a resolution

1150
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,301
to abolish slavery
for a long time.

1151
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,720
They sense that it's
a moral wrong.

1152
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:30,639
And the rest of the South
will follow Virginia's example.

1153
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,851
- All I ask is time.
- Time?

1154
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:35,311
Time?

1155
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,313
For 30 years,
I waited for the South

1156
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,356
to cleanse it's soul
of this crime.

1157
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,025
Since childhood
I've been possessed

1158
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:44,278
with the fire of correcting
this wrong.

1159
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:46,780
I tried peaceful agitation.

1160
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,907
As God as my witness, I tried.

1161
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,578
Peaceful means failed
long ago.

1162
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,330
Now I shall force a decision

1163
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:57,333
by bringing both side
into armed conflict.

1164
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,336
Letters, words, talk,
the time has ended for that.

1165
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,212
Strength and action
are wanted now.

1166
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,881
Not a voice crying
in the wilderness

1167
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:07,509
but a David armed
with the power and the glory.

1168
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,679
- David had a son, hadn't he?
- A son?

1169
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,639
Yes, Absalom,
who deserted his father

1170
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,558
and went over to the enemy.

1171
01:04:18,812 --> 01:04:21,065
What're you trying to tell me,
Stuart?

1172
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:23,400
And Absalom died
because he feared his father.

1173
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,405
Jason is dead!

1174
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:31,658
So be it.

1175
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:35,079
My son has paid for the sins
of this world with his life

1176
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,331
as once did the son of God.

1177
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,376
It shall not be in vain.

1178
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,813
Whether you kill me or not
my army will

1179
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:45,923
crush you all in the end.

1180
01:04:46,006 --> 01:04:48,717
My advice to you is to find
peace with your maker.

1181
01:04:54,431 --> 01:04:57,184
Now the big one.
Sit down.

1182
01:04:57,267 --> 01:04:59,269
I never liked barber's know-how.

1183
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,271
Now spill out,
you little, pitirim weasel.

1184
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,773
I'll cut your throat!
Where'd he go?

1185
01:05:02,856 --> 01:05:04,733
I swear, I don't know, boys,
uh, well,

1186
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,127
th... th... they've took him out
that way.

1187
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:07,653
- Who took him?
- T... three fellas.

1188
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:09,655
One of them was Oliver Brown.

1189
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,994
Do you see this razor?
Well, I'm keepin' it.

1190
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,014
If you moved a hair when we get
back, I'm gonna strop it

1191
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:20,249
on your liver
and barbecue your carcass.

1192
01:05:20,332 --> 01:05:22,251
Now you stay where you are.

1193
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:29,675
Back East for me!

1194
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,773
I called you all together
as witnesses

1195
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,859
to hear my words.

1196
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,069
An enemy to the cause
has entered our midst

1197
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,696
stealthily, and by night.

1198
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:53,740
With the purpose of planning our
destruction.

1199
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,242
The hand that has never
failed us

1200
01:05:55,325 --> 01:05:57,202
has come once again
to our protection.

1201
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,998
It's not with malice or revenge
that we take this man's life

1202
01:06:01,081 --> 01:06:02,416
but in just retribution.

1203
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:05,627
As befits all enemies
of mankind.

1204
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,754
All enemies of God.

1205
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:10,632
Ready, sir.

1206
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,703
Get back! Get back!
Move away from that door.

1207
01:06:39,786 --> 01:06:43,040
Cover those windows!
Surround the barn!

1208
01:07:28,418 --> 01:07:30,963
Get to the back door!

1209
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,101
Hold on there, captain!

1210
01:07:44,184 --> 01:07:46,079
Get down from there
if you don't wanna get killed.

1211
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:47,521
We's coming, boss.

1212
01:07:47,604 --> 01:07:49,523
That white man
talk like he's a friend.

1213
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,956
Lord all mercy, boss!
Looky here!

1214
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:07,791
Get the bags, quick.

1215
01:08:42,909 --> 01:08:44,536
Alright, get away
from the barn, men.

1216
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,997
- Move on! Hurry it up!
- Let him burn!

1217
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:49,499
Move on the wagons!

1218
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:51,668
Go! Get away from the barn.

1219
01:08:53,253 --> 01:08:54,253
Get those wagons rolling.

1220
01:09:04,097 --> 01:09:06,016
Take cover! Behind the wagons!

1221
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,536
It's Oliver!
First Jason, now him.

1222
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,748
- You wanna fight on, John?
- As long as breath is in me!

1223
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,168
Surround the church!

1224
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:39,860
- You alright, sir?
- Jeb!

1225
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:45,824
After them, George.
Don't let them get away.

1226
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:47,033
Load up!

1227
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:07,721
Ouch! That's too tight, Mammy.

1228
01:11:07,804 --> 01:11:09,806
Don't tell me how to do this,
boy.

1229
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,434
I've been wrapping
white folks all my life.

1230
01:11:12,517 --> 01:11:14,770
When they was babies
I wrapped one end

1231
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,230
and when they'd growed up
and took on too much corn liquor

1232
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,232
then I wrapped the other end.

1233
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,984
Huh. Is that what made you
leave home?

1234
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:25,489
Well, old John Brown said
he is gonna give us freedom

1235
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:28,158
but shook-in's, if this here
Kansas is freedom

1236
01:11:28,241 --> 01:11:29,701
then I ain't got no use for it.

1237
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,620
- No, sir.
- Me neither.

1238
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:33,663
I just wants to get back home
to Texas

1239
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,957
and sit till kingdom come.

1240
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:44,508
Dismount and fall out.

1241
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,309
Well, we had a nice ride.

1242
01:11:54,392 --> 01:11:56,478
- Both ways.
- Lost him, huh?

1243
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:58,480
He and a few others got away
in the hills.

1244
01:11:58,563 --> 01:12:01,399
I think I hit one, Jeb.
You oughta heard him holler.

1245
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,777
Heard him holler?
You jug head, that was me.

1246
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:07,113
- You shot my hat off.
- Well, it won't matter much.

1247
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:08,990
He's broken for good.

1248
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:11,868
From now on, he'll find
every man's hand against him.

1249
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:14,788
Nothing will ever break
the force of John Brown, Jeb.

1250
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:17,541
- Not even death.
- Oh, you are wrong, George.

1251
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:20,544
He's finished.
His force is broken forever.

1252
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,600
Why has thou afflicted
thy servant, oh, lord?

1253
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,686
Were for do I not find favor
with thee?

1254
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:42,524
Why has thou laid the weight
of all his people upon me?

1255
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:48,613
Yes.

1256
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,949
This is a sign for which
I have waited, oh, lord.

1257
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:53,785
This is your command.
The burning bush!

1258
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,958
Let there be no peace
in all this land

1259
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:03,670
until we have revenged ourselves
upon thine enemies.

1260
01:13:03,753 --> 01:13:06,089
As once you smote
the Philistines

1261
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:08,592
smite now the fury of thy wrath

1262
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:12,345
upon these blind misbegotten
fools.

1263
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:14,639
I shall be thy right hand.

1264
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:18,393
I, John Brown,
shall be the sword of Jehovah.

1265
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,079
Take a good look, gentlemen.

1266
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,373
The beginning of the railroad
to Santa Fe.

1267
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:43,126
These rails are gonna stretch
their way right across old trail

1268
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:46,379
right over Kansas down into
the territory of New Mexico.

1269
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,548
Someday we can tell our
grandchildren that we opened

1270
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,634
the doors of America
to the great Southwest.

1271
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:53,053
- Won't we, Kit?
- You just build your railroad.

1272
01:13:53,136 --> 01:13:55,472
I'm not guaranteeing
anything.

1273
01:13:55,555 --> 01:13:58,642
Yep! The end of John Brown
was our beginning.

1274
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:00,369
Maybe it'll cost a lot more
blood and grief

1275
01:14:00,393 --> 01:14:01,728
but it's gonna be worth it.

1276
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:04,606
Dad, can I ring the bell
on the first train?

1277
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:06,566
Yep, and blow the whistle.

1278
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,170
That'll be a day
you can live for, Kit.

1279
01:14:08,234 --> 01:14:09,736
Oh, won't it?

1280
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:23,792
Come fill your glasses
fellows.

1281
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:26,836
And stand up in a row.

1282
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:32,050
To singing sentimentally.

1283
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:34,886
We're going for to go.

1284
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,264
In the army there's sobriety.

1285
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,267
Promotion's very slow.

1286
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:47,816
So we'll sing our
reminiscences.

1287
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:50,735
Of Benny Havens' oh.

1288
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:54,197
Old Benny Havens' oh.

1289
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,075
Old Benny Havens' oh.

1290
01:14:57,158 --> 01:15:03,248
We'll sing our reminiscences.

1291
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:06,960
Of Benny Havens' oh.

1292
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:15,135
Congratulations, boys.

1293
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:17,387
- Thanks, sir.
- That was excellent.

1294
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:19,556
I didn't recognize the song.
Where does it come from?

1295
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:21,725
It's an old army song,
a farewell.

1296
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,285
These young men
have all been promoted

1297
01:15:23,309 --> 01:15:24,769
and are ordered back
to Washington.

1298
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,479
- That's splendid.
- You, lucky devils!

1299
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,898
I had to wait ten years
for my captaincy.

1300
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,692
And I also followed tradition
by proposing

1301
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:32,819
to my wife the same night.

1302
01:15:32,902 --> 01:15:33,963
Would you like some
refreshments?

1303
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:35,780
- Yes, I would.
- Splendid idea.

1304
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:40,493
Well, I think I'll run down
to the stable.

1305
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:42,579
Horse threw a shoe this morning.
Ah. See you later.

1306
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:44,664
I'll go with you,
maybe I can find it.

1307
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,255
Why did you have to go
and lie for

1308
01:15:52,338 --> 01:15:53,938
tellin' the major
we is the best barbeque

1309
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,341
along the Santa Fe trail?

1310
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:57,635
Oh, I just mentioned it
sort of casual.

1311
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,429
How'd I know he was gonna
take us up on it?

1312
01:15:59,512 --> 01:16:01,097
Wait till he starts eating this.

1313
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:03,892
He won't take us up,
he'd take us up and out.

1314
01:16:03,975 --> 01:16:06,394
Do you think it's gonna be hard
chewing, Tex?

1315
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:09,731
Well, I don't know,
I still got a hunch

1316
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:12,275
we should've skinned it first.

1317
01:16:12,358 --> 01:16:14,277
We took the horns off of it,
didn't we?

1318
01:16:16,946 --> 01:16:18,865
What is a captain's pay, Jeb,
$38?

1319
01:16:18,948 --> 01:16:20,992
- Uh-uh, $40.
- Forty a month.

1320
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,370
Say, that's enough to get..

1321
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:26,265
- Go on, get what?
- Well, you know, this and that.

1322
01:16:26,289 --> 01:16:28,208
What're you planning to do
with your extra pay?

1323
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,131
Exactly the same thing
as you are, son.

1324
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:36,841
- Want to draw straws?
- Not this time.

1325
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,468
This means too much.

1326
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,512
Well, how're we gonna
handle it then? Take turns?

1327
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:44,224
I don't trust you Southern boys
in the moon light.

1328
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:46,559
Alright,
let's ask her together.

1329
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:51,564
- Hey!
- Wait a minute.

1330
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,983
- What is this? You lunatics!
- Come on. Don't argue..

1331
01:16:54,067 --> 01:16:55,985
Just come along and listen.

1332
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:00,156
There you are.

1333
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,950
George has got something
to ask you, Kit.

1334
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:03,409
You have the floor, George.

1335
01:17:03,493 --> 01:17:06,079
Well, I don't know
just how to start, Kit.

1336
01:17:06,162 --> 01:17:07,723
But there's an old Indian woman
who hangs around

1337
01:17:07,747 --> 01:17:09,183
the fort
and tells people's fortunes.

1338
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,292
She is supposed to be
a wonder at it and..

1339
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:14,254
- Well..
- Yes, George?

1340
01:17:14,337 --> 01:17:16,923
Well, she said I'm going
to get married soon

1341
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:18,883
to a very beautiful girl.

1342
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:20,844
Did she, George?
That's very nice.

1343
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,930
Pretty slick opening remark.

1344
01:17:24,013 --> 01:17:27,976
Kit, were you ever by any chance
a blonde?

1345
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:30,854
- Why? No. Not even as a baby.
- Are you sure?

1346
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,939
This old woman
has never been wrong before.

1347
01:17:33,022 --> 01:17:35,567
- Absolutely sure.
- Well, maybe she's still right.

1348
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:38,045
There's a whole lot of beautiful
blondes in the world, George.

1349
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:39,487
Let's ask her.

1350
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:41,823
- Let's.
- Wait a minute.

1351
01:17:41,906 --> 01:17:46,286
Kit, are you in love with him
and not with me?

1352
01:17:46,369 --> 01:17:47,912
I guess I am, George.

1353
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,723
- You're gonna marry him?
- Oh, wait a minute.

1354
01:17:49,747 --> 01:17:52,250
I can handle this proposal
from now, son.

1355
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,043
Kit, you really mean that?

1356
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:56,004
You haven't asked me
anything yet.

1357
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,882
I wonder if I said
the wrong thing.

1358
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:01,801
Mm-mm-mm, couldn't have been
more perfect.

1359
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:03,678
Now where's that Indian?

1360
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:31,289
What she saying, Kit?
You know the lingo.

1361
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:33,208
She says that this is
one of the last times

1362
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,835
we'll all of us be together
as friends.

1363
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,297
Now ask her something sensible.

1364
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,133
Who is gonna be
the first general?

1365
01:18:52,018 --> 01:18:54,896
She says that one day
you'll all be famous men.

1366
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:56,731
Great in battle.

1367
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:58,608
But bitter enemies.

1368
01:19:02,153 --> 01:19:04,239
Pickett, Hood, Custer, Sheridan,
Longstreet

1369
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:06,241
and me enemies?
Now I know she's crazy.

1370
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,219
Where did you ever pickup
this old figure, George?

1371
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,703
I can tell better fortunes
than that with tea leaves.

1372
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,097
Well, we might as well get
our money's worth.

1373
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:13,224
Ask what we're gonna
fight about.

1374
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,583
Yeah, who is gonna start it?

1375
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,897
Well, what's this?
Too ridiculous to tell?

1376
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:41,317
She says,
the fight has already started.

1377
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:44,612
Somewhere in the east,
a man is lighting a torch.

1378
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:46,990
Now, at this very moment.

1379
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:49,867
The two of us will help
to kill him.

1380
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,869
But none of us can stop him.

1381
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:13,975
Here is where
I would attack first.

1382
01:20:14,058 --> 01:20:16,227
The arsenal at Harpers Ferry.

1383
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:19,230
Give me only a 100 good men,
Dr. Russell.

1384
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,984
Well armed and God-fearing men
who believe in the cause.

1385
01:20:23,067 --> 01:20:24,736
I will lead them through
Virginia.

1386
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,071
Arouse the thousands
of discontented slaves

1387
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,489
who will flock to join us.

1388
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,158
Then sweep down through
the south.

1389
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:33,494
Through the Carolinas,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi

1390
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:36,080
then with the entire nation
in the state of chaos

1391
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,999
we can dictate our own terms.

1392
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:40,835
Have you considered the army,
Captain Brown?

1393
01:20:40,918 --> 01:20:42,628
Surely, they'll be after you
in full force

1394
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:44,380
within a few hours
after you first attack.

1395
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:47,633
Let them come, Dr. Russell.
Let them try to stop me.

1396
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:49,469
I've studied that country
for years.

1397
01:20:49,552 --> 01:20:50,887
It's full of good hiding places

1398
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:53,348
natural forts where large forces
of brave men

1399
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,141
can defy pursuit indefinitely.

1400
01:20:55,224 --> 01:20:58,478
Mr. Rader will go ahead of us
and scout the town.

1401
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:00,104
With his knowledge
of military methods

1402
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,315
and our great advantage
of surprise

1403
01:21:02,398 --> 01:21:04,275
we can outwit the army
at every turn.

1404
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,277
Captain Brown,
this plan of yours is mad.

1405
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,237
Worse than mad,
it's high treason.

1406
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,990
Such a brazen attack
would lead to civil war.

1407
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,826
Exactly!
That is exactly what I want.

1408
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,537
Is it your wish then to destroy
the union?

1409
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:20,249
My answer to that is yes.
To the devil with the union.

1410
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:24,128
We've got to fight sometime,
it might as well be now.

1411
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:29,467
Gentlemen, I came here to Boston
at great personal risk.

1412
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,636
There's a price on my head
of $10,000.

1413
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:34,097
So, my time is precious.

1414
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,683
You've given me much help
and encouragement up to now.

1415
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:40,061
But all that we've done
in Kansas and elsewhere

1416
01:21:40,144 --> 01:21:41,604
will be all wasted

1417
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:44,273
unless you see it through
to the glorious end.

1418
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,947
How much money will you need?

1419
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,123
We now possess the guns,
ammunition

1420
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:02,375
pikes, a complete store
of supplies.

1421
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,585
To place in the RSF,
Harpers Ferry

1422
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:06,421
day break, Monday,
October the 16th.

1423
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:08,982
We must strike with two forces,
suddenly with complete surprise

1424
01:22:09,006 --> 01:22:11,384
and then move rapidly
through Virginia.

1425
01:22:11,467 --> 01:22:13,070
You men all know what will be
demanded of you.

1426
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,138
- Yes, we are waiting, captain.
- Captain.

1427
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:21,394
It's Rader. He made good time.

1428
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:33,114
Well, what did you find?

1429
01:22:33,197 --> 01:22:35,366
Speak up. Is anything wrong
at Harpers Ferry.

1430
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,010
Well, the town itself
won't any trouble.

1431
01:22:37,034 --> 01:22:38,929
There's a bridge at the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad

1432
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:39,972
to be blocked
and we got to cut that

1433
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:41,372
telegraph line to Washington.

1434
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,999
What about the government
arsenal?

1435
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:45,585
It's guarded by only two men.

1436
01:22:45,668 --> 01:22:47,420
Here, I made this rough map
of the place.

1437
01:22:50,256 --> 01:22:51,549
Good. Excellent.

1438
01:22:51,632 --> 01:22:53,509
This is precisely what I wanted.

1439
01:22:53,593 --> 01:22:55,320
We must first take
some hostages from the town

1440
01:22:55,344 --> 01:22:56,738
that'll prevent an attack
by the civilians.

1441
01:22:56,762 --> 01:22:58,073
Then we'll move directly
on the arsenal.

1442
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:00,475
- There's something else.
- What?

1443
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:02,310
I want to settle our account.

1444
01:23:02,393 --> 01:23:03,787
Back in Kansas
you promised to pay me

1445
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:05,354
what's due
when you got the money.

1446
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:08,357
How dare you demand a settlement
of a private matter?

1447
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,586
With the nation hour of
deliverance not three days off.

1448
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,862
That's putting the cart
before the horse, isn't it?

1449
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:14,822
I've done a job for you
nobody else can do.

1450
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,324
So, I was right at Palmyra

1451
01:23:16,407 --> 01:23:17,718
the cause itself
means nothing to you.

1452
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:19,011
I'm only holding you
to your word.

1453
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:20,471
Are you, indeed,
have you forgotten so

1454
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,680
quickly my measures with
disloyalty?

1455
01:23:21,704 --> 01:23:23,372
I haven't forgotten anything.

1456
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:25,350
But you got the money to pay me
and you can't afford not to.

1457
01:23:25,374 --> 01:23:27,418
Then add this to your memory.

1458
01:23:30,755 --> 01:23:32,048
I haven't waited 30 years

1459
01:23:32,131 --> 01:23:34,133
to bargain with a rouge
at the final hour.

1460
01:23:58,866 --> 01:24:01,035
Hiya.

1461
01:24:01,118 --> 01:24:02,954
This is the kind of army life
I like.

1462
01:24:03,037 --> 01:24:05,331
- Do you ever see me waltz?
- I've heard of it.

1463
01:24:05,414 --> 01:24:07,917
But this ain't no Santa Fe
shake down.

1464
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,212
Hold it. You're in high society
now, come on.

1465
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:16,050
May I have your invitations
please, gentlemen?

1466
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:19,136
- What's them?
- Thems 'em little white cards.

1467
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,598
We ain't go no invitations, Joe.
Can't we get in on our uniforms?

1468
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:26,102
No, sir. Not unless you wants to
go right out on 'em again.

1469
01:24:26,185 --> 01:24:28,229
Oh, we're the fellows
who cleaned up Kansas.

1470
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:30,231
- Ain't you ever heard of us.
- Sorry, sir.

1471
01:24:30,314 --> 01:24:32,316
But we don't need no cleaning.

1472
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,484
Good evening.

1473
01:24:54,839 --> 01:24:56,674
Hello, handsome.

1474
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:59,343
- Oh, hi, Jeb.
- My! You're a dream tonight.

1475
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,970
- How's the party?
- I don't know.

1476
01:25:01,053 --> 01:25:02,680
She hasn't come out yet.

1477
01:25:02,763 --> 01:25:04,932
- Who you waiting for?
- Old friend of mine.

1478
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,851
Promised me a surprise tonight.

1479
01:25:06,934 --> 01:25:08,936
A night I'd remember
the rest of my life.

1480
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,188
Yeah? You don't know any girl
here but Kit, you know?

1481
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,815
I-I'm not talking.

1482
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:14,710
Maybe you don't rate quite as
high as you think you do.

1483
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:16,152
Captain Stuart.

1484
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:19,113
Hello, Kit.

1485
01:25:19,196 --> 01:25:21,115
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

1486
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:23,093
Say, George was just telling me
you've promised him

1487
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:24,410
the biggest night of his life.

1488
01:25:24,493 --> 01:25:26,495
- Where do I come in?
- You don't.

1489
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:28,664
- I'm very fond of George.
- Thank you, Kit.

1490
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:32,043
I haven't told you this, but we
have a deep understanding.

1491
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:34,629
Wait a minute, Kit.
Are you serious? What is this?

1492
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:37,506
I'm gonna take care of George
for the rest of his life.

1493
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,258
That is if he's the man
I think he is.

1494
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:40,885
Oh, Kit, I have my faults.

1495
01:25:40,968 --> 01:25:42,070
But I can be as faithful
and loyal

1496
01:25:42,094 --> 01:25:43,113
as any man that ever lived.

1497
01:25:43,137 --> 01:25:44,388
We'll soon see.

1498
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:47,266
Now wait here, both of you.

1499
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:49,143
Tough luck, son,
I guess we can't all

1500
01:25:49,226 --> 01:25:51,103
have charm and good looks too.

1501
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:53,290
Custer, I hope you are joking
or you're not gonna have either.

1502
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:55,584
Oh, don't take it so hard, I
mean, this is something that...

1503
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:56,609
Hup.

1504
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:00,780
Charlotte, I want you to meet.

1505
01:26:00,863 --> 01:26:02,782
Captain Custer
and Captain Stuart.

1506
01:26:02,865 --> 01:26:05,385
This is Charlotte Davis. We were
schoolmates together in Boston.

1507
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:07,870
- It's a pleasure, Ms. Davis.
- Thank you, captain.

1508
01:26:07,953 --> 01:26:10,039
Yes, indeed.
A great pleasure.

1509
01:26:10,122 --> 01:26:12,249
I've heard so much about you,
Captain Custer.

1510
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,418
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

1511
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:18,005
Well, I, uh...
Well, that is, uh, I mean...

1512
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,800
Well, uh...
well, that is... I...

1513
01:26:20,883 --> 01:26:23,135
- Shall we dance, Jeb?
- Yes, of course.

1514
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,264
- Who is she?
- That's the blonde.

1515
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:30,142
The one that George was promised
by old "sit in the mud."

1516
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:32,520
Oh! I see.

1517
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,148
Well, she's pretty nice.

1518
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,652
Don't you think?

1519
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:43,739
Left wheel.

1520
01:26:45,491 --> 01:26:47,660
Company, halt!

1521
01:26:47,743 --> 01:26:50,830
Present arms,
prepare to scoop.

1522
01:26:57,503 --> 01:26:59,755
- Uh, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1523
01:27:02,883 --> 01:27:05,177
About face!

1524
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:07,555
Company, forward march!

1525
01:27:07,638 --> 01:27:09,390
Eyes right!

1526
01:27:09,473 --> 01:27:11,600
Right wheel.

1527
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,936
Well, there I was right out
in the middle of Kansas

1528
01:27:14,019 --> 01:27:16,814
facing 500 crazy fanatics
heavily armed.

1529
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:18,816
And me with only 15 soldiers.

1530
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:21,318
Good heavens, captain.
How terrifying.

1531
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:22,570
What did you do?

1532
01:27:22,653 --> 01:27:24,280
I sized up the situation
at a glance

1533
01:27:24,363 --> 01:27:25,924
dismounted and walked
straight toward them.

1534
01:27:25,948 --> 01:27:28,284
Not... not alone.

1535
01:27:28,367 --> 01:27:30,762
My dear, young lady, there comes
a time in every soldier's life

1536
01:27:30,786 --> 01:27:32,705
when he must stand
or fall alone.

1537
01:27:32,788 --> 01:27:34,224
And if you knew the army
you'd understand

1538
01:27:34,248 --> 01:27:36,584
that he who hesitates is lost.

1539
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:38,919
Well, that was something
wonderful, captain.

1540
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,796
Oh, it was nothing. Really.

1541
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:51,807
Will you come and meet
my father, captain?

1542
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:55,436
Why, I'd be delighted.
Is he in the government service?

1543
01:27:55,519 --> 01:27:57,706
Yes, but I think he'll lose
his job in the next election.

1544
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:00,149
Oh, that's too bad.
Say, he should be in the army.

1545
01:28:00,232 --> 01:28:01,650
You know,
politics don't bother us.

1546
01:28:01,734 --> 01:28:03,235
He'd rather go fishing anyway.

1547
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:04,487
- Father.
- Hello, Charlotte.

1548
01:28:04,570 --> 01:28:06,197
- Hello, Colonel Lee.
- My dear.

1549
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:09,200
Father, I'd like you to meet
Captain George Custer.

1550
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:11,410
Oh, but of course I met
the captain at West Point

1551
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,204
when he graduated, didn't I?

1552
01:28:13,287 --> 01:28:15,164
- Yes, sir.
- How're you, Custer?

1553
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:16,749
I'm fine, Colonel Lee.

1554
01:28:16,832 --> 01:28:18,810
We've heard good things
about you, congratulations.

1555
01:28:18,834 --> 01:28:20,377
Yes, the captain's just been
telling me

1556
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,755
how he put down the trouble
in Kansas by himself.

1557
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:27,802
Splendid job at Palmyra.
Splendid.

1558
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:30,221
Wasn't there also a chap
named Stuart, uh...

1559
01:28:30,304 --> 01:28:32,640
Jeb Stuart connected
with that campaign?

1560
01:28:32,723 --> 01:28:34,683
Stuart?

1561
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:37,853
Yes, sir. He was around.

1562
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:39,605
Shall we dance?

1563
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:57,081
Left turn.

1564
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:01,418
About face.

1565
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:02,878
March!

1566
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,261
- Jeb.
- Go away.

1567
01:29:10,344 --> 01:29:11,863
You danced with your sister
once already.

1568
01:29:11,887 --> 01:29:13,931
I don't want her,
I want you, come on.

1569
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:15,283
Hey, you can't leave me
stranded alone

1570
01:29:15,307 --> 01:29:16,387
in the middle of ball room.

1571
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:18,060
Quiet, spread. Phil, Phil.

1572
01:29:18,143 --> 01:29:20,271
Take over this detail,
will you?

1573
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,751
- Are you drunk?
- If I'm not, I ought to be.

1574
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:26,044
I've just seen enough to knock
anybody down.

1575
01:29:26,068 --> 01:29:27,278
What're you talking about?

1576
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:28,588
An old friend of yours
is outside.

1577
01:29:28,612 --> 01:29:30,406
And he asked me
to bring you to him.

1578
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:45,254
It's real.
I almost touched it.

1579
01:29:59,393 --> 01:30:00,978
What're you doing here?

1580
01:30:01,061 --> 01:30:03,522
I came to find you.

1581
01:30:03,606 --> 01:30:06,191
I know what you think of me,
Stuart. That I'm no good.

1582
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:09,653
Well, maybe you're right.

1583
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:11,006
Well, maybe I've got something
to tell you

1584
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:12,364
that'll change your opinion.

1585
01:30:12,448 --> 01:30:14,116
You'll have a hard time
doing that.

1586
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:17,661
Suppose I told you that I left
John Brown three hours ago

1587
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,580
with a well armed force of men

1588
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:22,625
not very many miles
from where we're standing.

1589
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:24,293
I'd say
you are out of your mind.

1590
01:30:24,376 --> 01:30:26,170
All set to strike
at Harpers Ferry

1591
01:30:26,253 --> 01:30:29,506
on the Maryland-Virginia line
sometime tonight.

1592
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,884
With the reinforcements
of over 1200 men

1593
01:30:31,967 --> 01:30:34,803
expected before daybreak
from Pennsylvania.

1594
01:30:34,887 --> 01:30:37,765
Brown plans to arouse the slaves

1595
01:30:37,848 --> 01:30:39,576
first in Virginia
and then throughout the south

1596
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,268
in open rebellion.

1597
01:30:41,352 --> 01:30:44,188
The telegraph wires will be cut
and he'll block the railroad

1598
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:46,607
and then at daybreak
they rush the arsenal

1599
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:48,359
take thousands of weapons
with the idea

1600
01:30:48,442 --> 01:30:50,444
of arming the Negroes.

1601
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:53,238
Well, that's the situation,
gentlemen. Move for move.

1602
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:55,216
I don't know, you may be able
to get there ahead of 'em

1603
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,410
but if you do,
you've got to move fast tonight.

1604
01:30:58,494 --> 01:31:01,246
It's fantastic,
our Secret Service has reported

1605
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,730
John Brown to be
out of the country.

1606
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,334
Well, I oughta know where he is?

1607
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:07,169
I've been with him
every day and every mile

1608
01:31:07,252 --> 01:31:08,462
since we left Kansas.

1609
01:31:08,545 --> 01:31:11,966
Then why have you informed
on him.

1610
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:15,344
Don't forget, colonel,
I was in the service once.

1611
01:31:15,427 --> 01:31:16,971
I was young,
and I made a mistake.

1612
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:20,391
I didn't know that then
but I do now.

1613
01:31:20,474 --> 01:31:22,202
I guess some of the things
we learned at West Point

1614
01:31:22,226 --> 01:31:26,480
stay on inside of us
a lot deeper than we realize.

1615
01:31:26,563 --> 01:31:29,274
Anyway, I couldn't stand by
and see my country torn apart

1616
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,235
by a mad man like Brown.

1617
01:31:31,318 --> 01:31:32,945
I had to come here.

1618
01:31:33,028 --> 01:31:36,031
This was something a lot bigger
than myself.

1619
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:37,592
Couldn't have been
the size of the reward

1620
01:31:37,616 --> 01:31:39,052
you'll get for turning him in,
could it?

1621
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:41,787
I said why I came here,
and that's the truth.

1622
01:31:43,205 --> 01:31:45,165
But I am entitled any reward.

1623
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:49,545
I'm even willing to go back
there and rejoin him tonight

1624
01:31:49,628 --> 01:31:53,632
just in case he gets suspicious
or changes his plans.

1625
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:56,593
Now what more proof
do you want than that?

1626
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:59,722
I believe him because
it's too dangerous not to.

1627
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:01,432
How soon can you start, colonel?

1628
01:32:01,515 --> 01:32:03,600
We'll be ready to leave
in an hour.

1629
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:05,269
The officers are all here.

1630
01:32:05,352 --> 01:32:06,520
Call them at once and proceed

1631
01:32:06,603 --> 01:32:09,064
with all speed
to Harpers Ferry.

1632
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:18,758
You have your orders,
Captain Stuart?

1633
01:32:18,782 --> 01:32:20,117
Yes, sir.

1634
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:22,745
Jeb, what is it?

1635
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:24,371
- What's happening?
- John Brown.

1636
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:25,807
Get the little Davis girl to
take you home.

1637
01:32:25,831 --> 01:32:27,225
- Will you, darling?
- But why, but...

1638
01:32:27,249 --> 01:32:29,043
I'm sorry.
I can't explain now, no time.

1639
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:30,437
Try to keep the others calm,
tell 'em,

1640
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:32,629
there's nothing
to be excited about.

1641
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:34,298
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1642
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:58,113
Good. There's no more worry
on that score.

1643
01:32:58,197 --> 01:33:00,574
You say no train is due until
well after daybreak.

1644
01:33:00,657 --> 01:33:02,409
No, sir, not until 8 o'clock.

1645
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:05,412
I rode within ten miles of
Washington to make sure.

1646
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:06,830
What kept you so long?

1647
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,540
I had to take a side road
both ways.

1648
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,335
Shubel, Townsley.

1649
01:33:11,418 --> 01:33:13,629
Get your men
block the railroad bridge.

1650
01:33:13,712 --> 01:33:15,464
We meet below the arsenal
at daybreak.

1651
01:33:15,547 --> 01:33:17,776
Kitzmiller, go to the town with
20 men and get the hostages.

1652
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,194
- You know the ones?
- Yes sir.

1653
01:33:19,218 --> 01:33:20,418
Rest you men, follow me.

1654
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,291
Drop your guns.

1655
01:34:01,343 --> 01:34:03,971
Captain, we got enough guns here
to arm a 1000 men.

1656
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:05,722
And plenty of powder
and bullets.

1657
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,951
Stack those guns and ammunition
near the door ready to haul.

1658
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,518
Hurry up, boys,
get 'em out there.

1659
01:34:09,601 --> 01:34:11,603
Men from Pennsylvania will
be here within the hour.

1660
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:13,230
This isn't an arsenal,
it's a fortress.

1661
01:34:13,313 --> 01:34:14,982
We could stand off
the whole army here.

1662
01:34:15,065 --> 01:34:16,567
What about the prisoners,
captain?

1663
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,652
What is the meaning
of this outrage?

1664
01:34:18,735 --> 01:34:21,864
Why have you broken into our
homes and dragged us here?

1665
01:34:21,947 --> 01:34:25,951
- Who are you? John Brown!
- I am John Brown of Kansas.

1666
01:34:26,034 --> 01:34:27,846
You are prisoners
of the provisional government

1667
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:29,288
of the United States.

1668
01:34:29,371 --> 01:34:31,039
If the citizens of
Harpers Ferry

1669
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:34,835
attempt any interference,
I shall use you as I see fit.

1670
01:34:34,918 --> 01:34:36,437
Otherwise, you will be
peacefully released

1671
01:34:36,461 --> 01:34:39,006
when we depart.

1672
01:34:39,089 --> 01:34:41,169
We must adhere to our schedule
to the precise minute.

1673
01:34:41,216 --> 01:34:43,136
We will leave here
at 10 o'clock and by nightfall

1674
01:34:43,177 --> 01:34:44,720
we should be 35 miles
into Virginia.

1675
01:34:44,803 --> 01:34:46,443
What about the men
from Pennsylvania, sir?

1676
01:34:46,471 --> 01:34:47,907
If they're late in arriving,
we cannot wait.

1677
01:34:47,931 --> 01:34:49,892
Wouldn't that be taking
a long chance?

1678
01:34:49,975 --> 01:34:51,685
No word of us can leak out
until tomorrow

1679
01:34:51,768 --> 01:34:54,730
maybe even two or three days,
and then we'd be 1,500 men.

1680
01:34:54,813 --> 01:34:57,065
I don't see that there's
any reason to hurry.

1681
01:34:57,149 --> 01:34:59,318
- That sound sensible.
- I disagree.

1682
01:34:59,401 --> 01:35:00,753
I'm anxious to get out of here
and time

1683
01:35:00,777 --> 01:35:02,154
is our most valuable weapon.

1684
01:35:02,237 --> 01:35:04,489
Well, you're in command, sir.

1685
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:06,718
But that's been the fatal
mistake to many an expedition.

1686
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:08,702
My advice is to wait.

1687
01:35:27,137 --> 01:35:28,889
Some of the townspeople
are firing at us?

1688
01:35:28,972 --> 01:35:31,183
Just a handful of "em
with old shotguns.

1689
01:35:31,266 --> 01:35:34,228
We can clean them out
in five minutes.

1690
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:40,359
Idiots! Why do they fight us?
Can't they understand?

1691
01:35:52,829 --> 01:35:54,957
- What is your name?
- Brewer.

1692
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,334
If you value your life and those
of your fellow townsman

1693
01:35:57,417 --> 01:35:59,169
you will do as I say.

1694
01:36:00,545 --> 01:36:01,922
Yes.

1695
01:36:11,139 --> 01:36:15,936
Stop firing. You're endangering
the your lives of your friends.

1696
01:36:16,019 --> 01:36:20,524
John Brown promises that if we
leave the arsenal in his hands

1697
01:36:20,607 --> 01:36:22,609
he will harm none of us.

1698
01:36:22,693 --> 01:36:25,612
No! Run down to us!

1699
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:27,823
We'll cover you. Quick.

1700
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:36,290
Stupid cattle!

1701
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:39,001
Can't they understand
we're here on a righteous cause.

1702
01:36:39,084 --> 01:36:42,296
Their interests are also ours.
The good of the whole nation.

1703
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:43,964
We'll leave out lesson
at Harpers Ferry

1704
01:36:44,047 --> 01:36:45,716
for the rest of the South
to profit by.

1705
01:36:45,799 --> 01:36:48,051
Wipe out those fools
at the foot of the hill.

1706
01:37:11,074 --> 01:37:12,576
Cease firing!

1707
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,787
We're moving into the hills.

1708
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,142
Take all the weapons
and ammunition

1709
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,668
you can carry with speed.

1710
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:23,128
It's well past noon.

1711
01:37:23,211 --> 01:37:25,630
We can wait no longer
for the Pennsylvanians.

1712
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:34,681
"Eighteen citizens
of Harpers Ferry killed,

1713
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,142
thirty-three wounded
by John Brown's invaders

1714
01:37:37,225 --> 01:37:38,727
in open rebellion.”

1715
01:37:40,687 --> 01:37:43,857
It's from the second force
at Frederick, Maryland.

1716
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,984
"The road to Harpers Ferry
is blocked.

1717
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:47,819
Unable to get through.”

1718
01:37:50,697 --> 01:37:52,449
"Jefferson guards
and the Winchesters

1719
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:55,869
under Lee's command passed
through Upperville an hour ago.

1720
01:37:55,952 --> 01:37:57,954
They will be the first
to arrive at the ferry."

1721
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:11,802
- What're you watching, Rader?
- The North Road, sir...

1722
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:14,197
The North Road is over there.
This is the Washington Turnpike.

1723
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,782
Well, I thought our men might
circle the town...

1724
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:18,475
That was not their orders.
Help with the wagons.

1725
01:38:18,558 --> 01:38:20,727
Yes, sir.

1726
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:22,580
Well, don't you think we ought
to wait another half hour?

1727
01:38:22,604 --> 01:38:24,272
It might be...

1728
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,907
Every man inside!
Bolt the doors!

1729
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,659
- Bolt those door!
- Man the loophole!

1730
01:39:13,155 --> 01:39:15,365
Wait, you said.

1731
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:18,160
"There is no cause to hurry.
Wait."

1732
01:39:19,953 --> 01:39:22,247
Yes, sure I did.
I thought we had time.

1733
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:24,374
- Stuart.
- Yes, sir.

1734
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:27,252
I want you to take this under
a white flag to John Brown.

1735
01:39:27,335 --> 01:39:28,879
Right, sir.

1736
01:39:37,429 --> 01:39:39,806
There's to be no parlaying.
Yes or no?

1737
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:41,766
If it's a refusal,
wave your hat to us.

1738
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,393
Right, sir.

1739
01:39:45,896 --> 01:39:47,731
Hang on to this, will you?

1740
01:39:52,444 --> 01:39:54,112
Captain Brown,
they're coming up the road

1741
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:55,447
with a flag of truce.

1742
01:40:26,478 --> 01:40:28,230
Open the door.

1743
01:40:40,784 --> 01:40:44,496
- You're John Brown of Kansas?
- I am.

1744
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:46,039
We've met before I think?

1745
01:40:46,122 --> 01:40:48,667
And thanks to Mr. Rader,
we how meet again.

1746
01:40:56,383 --> 01:40:58,361
This is Colonel Lee's formal
demand for your surrender.

1747
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:01,137
Once more, sir, you over rate
your strength and supposing

1748
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:04,140
that I can be taken
against my will.

1749
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:07,143
- That's your final answer?
- It is.

1750
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:09,145
We prefer to die here.

1751
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,071
Try to surround them!

1752
01:41:18,154 --> 01:41:19,507
Take troop B to the right
of the gallop,

1753
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:20,907
troop A at the left
of the gallop.

1754
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:24,619
Troop C, draw your guns,
dismount!

1755
01:41:24,703 --> 01:41:27,122
- Take cover!
- Forward and a gallop! Ho!

1756
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:03,533
Bring the right flank
into position.

1757
01:42:49,829 --> 01:42:51,998
Attack with C troop
on the left flank.

1758
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:54,000
C troop, at first!

1759
01:43:32,205 --> 01:43:34,165
Prepare a battering ram.

1760
01:43:38,795 --> 01:43:40,547
Keep firing!

1761
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:47,011
Forward.

1762
01:43:47,095 --> 01:43:49,097
Forward!

1763
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,307
Forward!

1764
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,679
All of you keep on firing!

1765
01:44:51,117 --> 01:44:52,494
No.

1766
01:44:52,577 --> 01:44:56,247
So Judas betrayed him
for a handful of silver.

1767
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:59,042
Don't!

1768
01:45:30,365 --> 01:45:31,574
Cease firing.

1769
01:46:05,358 --> 01:46:07,235
Over, hut!

1770
01:46:39,309 --> 01:46:43,438
Now, Kit.
He was born for this.

1771
01:46:43,521 --> 01:46:46,316
I'm not crying for him, Jeb.

1772
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,068
I see something else up there.

1773
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:52,405
Something much more terrible
than just one man.

1774
01:46:52,488 --> 01:46:56,284
Have you any last words,
John Brown?

1775
01:46:56,367 --> 01:46:59,913
I am only walking as God
foreordained I should walk.

1776
01:47:02,206 --> 01:47:03,541
All of my actions,

1777
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:05,752
even the follies
leading to this disaster

1778
01:47:05,835 --> 01:47:10,048
were decreed to happen long ages
before this world began.

1779
01:47:10,131 --> 01:47:12,175
But I cannot remember
a night so dark

1780
01:47:12,258 --> 01:47:15,303
has to have hindered
the coming day,

1781
01:47:15,386 --> 01:47:18,389
or a storm so furious
has to prevent the return

1782
01:47:18,473 --> 01:47:20,975
of warm sunshine
in the country of peace.

1783
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:26,314
I, John Brown,
am now quite certain

1784
01:47:26,397 --> 01:47:29,692
that the crimes of this guilty
land can never be purged away

1785
01:47:29,776 --> 01:47:31,527
but with blood.

1786
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:36,741
I let them hang me.

1787
01:47:36,824 --> 01:47:38,868
I forgive them
and may God forgive them

1788
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:41,120
for they know not what they do.

1789
01:47:53,883 --> 01:47:57,261
So perish all such enemies
of the union.

1790
01:47:57,345 --> 01:47:59,806
All such foes of the human race.

1791
01:48:11,609 --> 01:48:13,945
"For this company,
and thereto have given

1792
01:48:14,028 --> 01:48:16,572
and pledged their truth
each to the other.

1793
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:19,367
And have declared the same by
giving and receiving a ring

1794
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:21,119
and by joining hands.

1795
01:48:21,202 --> 01:48:23,997
I pronounce that
they are man and wife

1796
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:27,709
united forever with ties that no
man shall breaketh under,

1797
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:29,419
nor the years disturbed

1798
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:32,130
whose shining path shall run
together from this day

1799
01:48:32,213 --> 01:48:33,756
hence unto eternity."”
