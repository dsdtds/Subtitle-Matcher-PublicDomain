1
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,621
- Here's Singapore, in
the south of Malaya.

2
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,741
Population approximately 550,000.

3
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,578
University, ship building,
important seaport.

4
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,956
- Doesn't it say anything
about the 32 nightclubs there?

5
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,885
- Have you already
worked down in Singapore?

6
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,294
Not to work.

7
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,505
However, I once had a
friend, an oil sheik.

8
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,215
He took me with him down there.

9
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,892
He was quite a guy.

10
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,677
Those are the guys that run around

11
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,595
in turbans, aren't they?

12
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,931
- Listen, honey, when they
take those turbans off

13
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,225
they're just like any other man.

14
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,776
Got a light?

15
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,111
Oh.

16
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:14,901
Looking forward to going to Singapore?

17
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:17,070
Mm, I don't really care when I dance,

18
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,914
as long as the pay's good.

19
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,464
That's him now.

20
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,467
Hm.

21
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,767
Hi.
- Hi.

22
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:43,430
I've already been to Singapore.

23
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,472
And you look like it.

24
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:46,023
Oh, Gary.

25
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,699
Ah, hello, Gary.

26
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:55,567
Hi, Georgia.

27
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,277
You're looking prettier every day.

28
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,653
How in the world do you do it?

29
00:03:58,654 --> 00:04:00,113
- Mike.
- Yeah?

30
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,407
- Have you told the girls
what this is all about?

31
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,826
Sure, Gary, a tour for a dancing troop.

32
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,745
First engagement, Singapore.

33
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,247
I have 12 of them here to pick from.

34
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:10,957
Okay, Georgia, let the girls in.

35
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,667
We don't have much time.

36
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,335
- All right if we start
now, Mr. Blackwood?

37
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,886
Of course.

38
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:18,214
Oh, but one at a time, please.

39
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,392
Okay, May?

40
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,554
Smile, will you?

41
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,513
How do you do?

42
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,182
That's Mr. Webster, the manager.

43
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,600
And this is May.

44
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,694
She's the finest dancer in town.

45
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,688
What was your last engagement?

46
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,648
With the Corkettes, one year.

47
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,608
One of the finest.

48
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,735
Mm, legs?

49
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,069
Pardon me?

50
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,696
- Mr. Webster would like
to look at your legs.

51
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,247
Oh, sure.

52
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,534
Thank you, you're hired.

53
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:47,744
Please wait outside.

54
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,295
Oh, thank you.

55
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,215
Hm, May, Corkettes.

56
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,168
And this is Rhonda Hunter.

57
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,085
Dancer?

58
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,636
Not really.

59
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,548
But I pick things up real fast.

60
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,099
Hm.

61
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,221
Thank you, we're looking for dancers.

62
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,014
- But what's that got
to do with Singapore?

63
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:08,848
Come on, honey.

64
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,399
Don't hold us up.

65
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,402
Babs?

66
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,232
This is Babs.

67
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,526
Her legs are worth their weight in gold.

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,736
Can those golden legs also dance?

69
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:24,739
- I was solo dancer in
the Apollo Varieties.

70
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,033
And why did you leave there?

71
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:28,701
Well, the boss really went for her.

72
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,712
But his wife thought otherwise.

73
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,375
All right, you can work with us,

74
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,418
as long as you don't have any affairs.

75
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:40,180
Mr. Webster doesn't
tolerate any fooling around.

76
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,424
I had all the boys I can take.

77
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,975
Come on.

78
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,936
Carolyn.

79
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,890
This little one's from
the national ballet.

80
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,433
Could you dance a little bit for us?

81
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,268
Glad to.

82
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,102
Would you put this one on for me?

83
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,613
Sure, let's have a look.

84
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,076
Thank you, Carolyn.

85
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,953
You dance wonderfully.

86
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:38,247
But I'm afraid ballet is
not What we're looking for.

87
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:39,798
Oh.

88
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:42,418
Don't be sad, honey.

89
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,046
I tell you what, come in again tomorrow.

90
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:45,880
Yeah?

91
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,382
Yeah, I've got something else for you.

92
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,925
Oh, thanks.

93
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,685
Hello, Cat! Come in.

94
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,846
Hello, Gary! Hi, Georgia!

95
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,641
- Well, Cat? Lost some weight?
- I hardly eat anything anymore.

96
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,061
Well done, Cat. Just don't put on
any weight again. Please wait outside.

97
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,657
I'm looking forward to working
with both of you again!

98
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,159
All right.

99
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,490
Here are Gladys and Doreen.

100
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:15,076
I told you to let them in separately.

101
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,119
These babes have been working

102
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,912
from the start as a duo number.

103
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:20,540
- And we would very much like
to stay together, if possible.

104
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,625
- On this tour you'll be
dancing with other girls.

105
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:23,668
That doesn't matter.

106
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,337
As long as we get to go overseas.

107
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,880
All right, you can both work with us.

108
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,090
Please send the next one in.

109
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:29,924
Yeah.

110
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,475
- Thank you.
- See you.

111
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,521
Linda.

112
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,525
Hello there.

113
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,156
Mm, you're a stripper?

114
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,276
At times.

115
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,945
- Didn't I see you work
the Sapphire Club last month?

116
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,488
How observant of you.

117
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:55,041
How come you quit that place?

118
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,869
The boss wanted to.

119
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,412
I didn't.

120
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,132
Oh, are you always so pickiunish?

121
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:07,128
That depends on the boss, boss.

122
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,056
Shall I dance for you?

123
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,884
It's not necessary.

124
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,435
You're hired.

125
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,896
Wait outside.
- Okay.

126
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,861
Next girl please.

127
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,688
My name is Nelly Hastings.

128
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,523
A new one, I haven't seen her work yet,

129
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,150
but she's always been with good troops.

130
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,701
Let's see her dance.

131
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,280
Thank you, you're hired.

132
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,831
Please wait outside.

133
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:22,161
So Mr. Blackwood has supplied
all the girls we need.

134
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:23,454
Fine, Georgia.

135
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:25,665
Go and tell the girls when
customer dance rehearsals

136
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,291
will start, will you please?

137
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,842
Okay
- All right.

138
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:32,380
- Listen, Gary, I thought
you were the boss.

139
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,632
But you let Georgia select all the girls.

140
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,592
I select all the girls.

141
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:37,426
You?

142
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:38,970
But you didn't say a word.

143
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,012
Why should I?

144
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,764
I have a little trick.

145
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,641
When I keep my legs apart like so,

146
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:45,601
it means I'm not interested.

147
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:49,531
When I cross them like
this, ah, then it's okay.

148
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,158
You always were a crazy guy.

149
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,411
When do things get underway?

150
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,113
Oh, 10 days.

151
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:57,947
10 days?

152
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,283
Well then, have a good trip.

153
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,834
Thank you.

154
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,215
We're now flying

155
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,634
over the Pacific Ocean near Honolulu.

156
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,811
Altitude is 15,000 feet.

157
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,353
Mayday, mayday, mayday,
Clipper 247, Clipper 247.

158
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,855
We are 9,000 feet and losing altitude.

159
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:13,981
Number two engine burning.

160
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:16,317
Drop further to effect
the emergency landing.

161
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,286
Present position is...

162
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,280
Repeat your position.

163
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,157
Repeat your position.

164
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,168
Damn, I can't pick him up anymore.

165
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,921
Clipper 247.

166
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,684
No, Mr. Hastings, I can only repeat

167
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,937
there's absolutely no reason
yet to fear the worst.

168
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,023
Until now we only know
that the plane caught fire

169
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:58,076
and that we've lost radio contact.

170
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,363
Yeah, I'll let you know immediately,

171
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,165
soon as I hear something new.

172
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,682
Blackwood Agency.

173
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,520
No, Mr. Alberts, I don't
have any further information.

174
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,973
But of course there's a
search party out there.

175
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,018
I tell you, rescuers are
looking all over for them.

176
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,654
There's still hope, even after four days.

177
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:39,242
Yes, I'll call you as soon
as I hear something new.

178
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:29,167
- Stop that bawling,
you're driving us all nuts.

179
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,588
Water, just one swallow.

180
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,298
No more today.

181
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,392
Tomorrow you'll get another ration.

182
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:52,231
Gary, give me some water.

183
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,569
Who do you think you are?

184
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,609
The fifth night.

185
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,662
We can't hold out much longer.

186
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,331
You're starting that too, Georgia?

187
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,659
A ship has to go by here sometime.

188
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,920
Or we've got to at least see some land.

189
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,390
Water, please give me water.

190
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,478
Look, a bird!

191
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,357
- Where there are birds
there must be land.

192
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,268
Are you crazy?

193
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,819
Give that to me.

194
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,958
Look at that, Gary, over there.

195
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,077
Land, there's land.

196
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:55,995
Help me paddle.

197
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,829
We've got to make it.

198
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,164
Paddle with your hands.

199
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,715
Come on, come on.

200
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,344
Don't stop now, we'll make it.

201
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:15,106
It's not far now, then we'll be safe.

202
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,050
Oh, I can't go on anymore.

203
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,894
Come, I'll help you.

204
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,367
There you are, Georgia.

205
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,918
Lie down.

206
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,008
I can't go anymore.

207
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,761
Here.

208
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,284
Babs.

209
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,435
Kate.

210
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,187
Georgia, darling.

211
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:16,913
Oh, Gary.

212
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,997
Gary, Gary.

213
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,485
Water.

214
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,167
Ah.

215
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,995
Water, water.

216
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:07,830
Water, water.

217
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,540
- What, Gary?
- Come on.

218
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,417
Come on, come on.

219
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,793
- Oh.
- Water?

220
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,753
- Where is it?
- That's wonderful.

221
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:16,880
- Let's go.
- Come on, girl.

222
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,641
- Oh, water.
- Oh.

223
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,019
Oh, how wonderful.

224
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:31,070
Come here!

225
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,449
Look, fresh drinking water.

226
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,993
There it is, there it is.

227
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,087
Oh, way over there.

228
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,126
- Watch out.
- Oh, let me in.

229
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,878
- Wonderful.
- Cold.

230
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,055
Oh, feel it.

231
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,886
- Oh, is anything
more wonderful than water?

232
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,262
Mm, wonderful.

233
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,264
Okay, girls, that's enough.

234
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,932
Let's go and have a look around.

235
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,392
Come on, come on, come on.

236
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:11,560
Come on, Georgia.

237
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,686
Ready?

238
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:14,237
Let's go.

239
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,943
- That was good.
- Feeling better now?

240
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,236
- Stupid shoe.
- Don't lag behind.

241
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:23,247
Oh, I'll help you.

242
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,993
- Thanks.
- Yours are too high for here.

243
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:31,121
- Kate, your scarf.
- Oh, keep it.

244
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:32,672
Coming?

245
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,227
- Oh, this is like paradise.
- Yeah!

246
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,821
In any case, we're safe here.

247
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:00,692
Wait a minute! Did you hear that?

248
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:02,243
No.

249
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:04,205
Well, let's move on.

250
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:06,874
I didn't hear anything either.

251
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,544
I like it here.

252
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,256
Who would have thought
of this yesterday?

253
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:21,722
- Ouch! That stings.
- Help!

254
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,645
Hold on!

255
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,111
Thanks.

256
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,078
Come. Let's get over there.

257
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:11,062
OW, ouch.

258
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,816
Careful, girls.

259
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,370
Listen, what a strange silence.

260
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:30,365
Well, let's keep going.

261
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,867
I wonder where it leads.

262
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,701
I wonder how much further

263
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,292
we're going to have to go.

264
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,095
Ouch, my shoe.

265
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,464
This way.

266
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,548
It's not very good for shoes.

267
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:49,176
No, it sure isn't.

268
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,054
Gary, look what I just found.

269
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,639
What?

270
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,890
A hammer.

271
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,433
There must be someone on this island.

272
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,684
Really?

273
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,812
A hammer with a long handle.

274
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:02,397
It must be for the purpose

275
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,650
of excavating some sort of metal,

276
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,693
most probably uranium.

277
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,111
Can you eat that?

278
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:10,072
Yeah, you could try it.

279
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,863
Come on, let's go and find out.

280
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,635
Need long boots for this walk.

281
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,220
Come on, hurry up, look.

282
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,771
Come here.

283
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,275
Look, a cabin.
- Oh.

284
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:56,447
Let's get out of here.

285
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:08,180
A dead man in a huge web.

286
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,558
Oh, Gary.

287
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,418
- I have to get him down.
- Gary!

288
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,799
It's not working!

289
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,969
I need something.

290
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,555
Gary, there!

291
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,803
- My Bag! I have to get it.
- Are you crazy?

292
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,889
I wouldn't be seen dead
in a place like that.

293
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,724
Maybe we're safer in the cabin.

294
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,275
I'm so scared!

295
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,328
Hey there.

296
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,329
Do you think we should?

297
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,789
I don't know.

298
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:29,094
Come on.

299
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,154
Blackwood Agency. Yes, that's me.

300
00:26:48,022 --> 00:26:49,572
What?

301
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,493
Did you find them?

302
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:56,997
No trace of them?

303
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:00,793
So they could still be alive?

304
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,539
What? The search is canceled?

305
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,592
You can't just give up if you
haven't found them yet!

306
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,752
After all, nine lives are at stake.

307
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:15,182
I'll take every step to force you
to continue the search!

308
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,852
The poor professor.

309
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,813
When he made the last entry in the diary

310
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,482
he didn't know how horribly he would die.

311
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:35,944
- Well, his discovery
of the uranium deposits

312
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,488
didn't help him any, even if it does

313
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,457
represent a tremendous fortune.

314
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,909
We must keep it from the girls

315
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,996
that Professor Green had
a premonition of his fate.

316
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,540
You see here in the last paragraph?

317
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,002
He says he thought something
terrible was going to happen.

318
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,096
He just felt the danger.

319
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,924
- I wonder where that
peculiar hissing came from

320
00:27:57,925 --> 00:27:59,518
that he always heard.

321
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:01,970
Oh, Gary, I'm terribly scared.

322
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,847
I'm so afraid.

323
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,398
Don't worry, Georgia.

324
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,978
As long as I'm around,
nothing will happen to you.

325
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,529
I promise.

326
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,525
- Hi, Georgia.
- I'm hungry.

327
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,985
I've made something for you to eat.

328
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,972
Lucky there were some canned goods here.

329
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,033
Mm, food.

330
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,285
- It must have been a
really gigantic spider

331
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,787
to be able to spin such a huge web.

332
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,206
Maybe there are more of them.

333
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,000
- But a bite like that couldn't
have come from a spider.

334
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,636
Stop it, you're all ruining my appetite.

335
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:36,630
Aren't you at all afraid?

336
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,631
Afraid?

337
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,308
I can't change anything.

338
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:43,771
- I'm terribly afraid something
awful is going to happen.

339
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,898
Look.

340
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:51,811
- We found the professor's
trunk full of stuff.

341
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:53,572
They'll certainly be useful.

342
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,077
- One, four, five, six,
seven, eight, okay.

343
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,782
If we divide the provisions up carefully

344
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,542
they should last for a month.

345
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:08,411
What did you say, Georgia, a month?

346
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,623
Do you really think we'll
be here a whole month?

347
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,174
I don't know.

348
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,835
- We have to go tomorrow
to the highest cliff

349
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:19,139
and light a smoke signal
to try and attract a ship.

350
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,309
10, 11, 12.

351
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,762
Give me that shirt.

352
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:26,596
No, it belongs to me.

353
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:27,597
After all, I found it.

354
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:29,224
- But my dress is in
worse shape than yours.

355
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,684
No, I want to have it.

356
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,559
Give it to me.

357
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,894
Give it to me.

358
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,771
Hey, stop that fighting.

359
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,322
Give me that shirt.

360
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,158
Georgia.

361
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,494
Thanks, Gary.

362
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,238
I suppose we could have guessed

363
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,249
that Georgia would be getting it.

364
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,327
- Haven't you ever noticed
that Gary pampers her?

365
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:50,161
What's this?

366
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:51,538
Where did you get the pullover?

367
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,873
- I found it here, if you
don't have anything against it.

368
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:55,424
Ha.

369
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:58,262
- Now stop it or I'll
take care of both of you.

370
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,422
Give me something to drink, Gladys.

371
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,881
Mm.

372
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:02,966
Take it easy, Gary.

373
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,010
We're all a little nervous.

374
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,062
It's really no wonder.

375
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:10,890
- Don't you think I'd rather
be in a bar in Singapore

376
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:15,404
with a nice cold drink than to
be on this godforsaken place,

377
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,700
drinking this horrible stuff?

378
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:23,361
Bah.

379
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:24,913
Darned heat.

380
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:29,701
Look out, will ya?

381
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,745
And stop making so much noise.

382
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,705
- If you don't like it,
you can do the dishes.

383
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,416
Or do you think I'm doing
this for my own pleasure?

384
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,886
Stop blowing your top and off, will you?

385
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:45,050
I simply can't stand

386
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,102
this frightful heat any longer.

387
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,603
- How about throwing your
dirty blouse some place else?

388
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,155
I want to sleep.

389
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:11,701
I sure hope you don't lose your lipstick.

390
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:15,047
You'd hardly be able to get
along on this island Without it?

391
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,096
I'm through.

392
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,173
It's about time.

393
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,466
Now I'll shower.

394
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,017
Give it here.

395
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:30,553
Come on, come on, girls.

396
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:31,388
Let's go to sleep.

397
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,514
I'm going to sleep outside.

398
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,348
Goodnight.

399
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,899
- Me too.
- Goodnight.

400
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:36,976
Here.
- Goodnight.

401
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,527
Goodnight, Kate.

402
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:25,325
Good, I found the professor's revolver.

403
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,569
Get some sleep, Gary.

404
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,862
I can't.

405
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,655
I think I'll go out for a little walk.

406
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:33,875
But don't worry, I'll
be back very shortly.

407
00:33:26,545 --> 00:33:28,095
Gary.

408
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,269
Oh, Gary.

409
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,746
Gary!

410
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,420
This damned heat.

411
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:03,423
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

412
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:53,116
- Those were shots,
I heard them clearly.

413
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:57,120
Oh, I hope nothing's happened to Gary.

414
00:36:17,966 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm going.

415
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,926
If you're not coming
with me, I'm going alone.

416
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,094
Stay here, don't leave us alone.

417
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,645
You won't find Gary.

418
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:30,269
Oh, just leave everything as it is.

419
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,729
We must find Gary.

420
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,732
Babs and Ann, you go in that direction.

421
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:35,775
Where in the world is Kate?

422
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,776
Here, Georgia.

423
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,946
You two go in that direction.

424
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,124
Kate and May will go along with me.

425
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,252
Hurry up.

426
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,046
What about me?

427
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:50,415
You?

428
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,457
You remain here

429
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:54,177
and put things in order while we're gone.

430
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,436
Hey, Gary.

431
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:07,724
Would you quit that whistling?

432
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:08,933
You're making me nervous.

433
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,764
I'm not afraid when I whistle.

434
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,910
Gary!

435
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:23,163
Gary.

436
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,949
Gary.

437
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,500
Gary.

438
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,252
Gary.

439
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,587
Gary.

440
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,123
Come on, we gotta keep looking.

441
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,342
Without me, I'm staying right here.

442
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,005
Did you hear anything?

443
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,548
No.

444
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,799
But there's something moving there.

445
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,435
I don't hear anything.

446
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,929
Gary.

447
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,390
Hey, Gladys, don't leave me alone.

448
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:50,941
Then hurry up.

449
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:54,194
Gary.
- Gary.

450
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,909
- Gary.
- Gary.

451
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,705
- Gary.
- Gary.

452
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,583
Gary.

453
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,172
Gary.

454
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,612
I heard a scream.

455
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,163
I heard it plainly.

456
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,875
The scream came from there.

457
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:46,181
Linda.

458
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,563
Come on, girls, help me.

459
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,284
How awful.

460
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,833
She's been strangled.

461
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,084
The spider.

462
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,916
Ann, Ann.

463
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,834
Oh, it's horrible.

464
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:23,628
Oh, Georgia, the professor's been killed,

465
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,088
Gary's disappeared, and now
we've just buried Linda.

466
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,507
Which one of us is going to be next?

467
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:30,676
I don't want to die, I don't want to die,

468
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:31,719
I don't want to die.

469
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,887
Ann, Ann.

470
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,013
Now stop it, will you?

471
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,015
Stop it, before you drive us all crazy.

472
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,142
Stop it.
- Not me, not me.

473
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:40,478
- And I tell you, they'll
never find us, never.

474
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,812
But I'm sure the police are moving

475
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:44,032
heaven and hell to find us, honey?

476
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,317
The police?

477
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,361
The cops I know, if they catch you

478
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,154
speeding a little bit or find you drunk

479
00:40:50,155 --> 00:40:52,031
they send you right off to the cooler.

480
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,783
But you just let somebody get lost

481
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,202
and they won't lift a finger.

482
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,371
Do you believe that
they'll go running around

483
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,539
for a few broads who are lost?

484
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,499
But how are they to know

485
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,918
that we've been rescued
and on this little island?

486
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,752
Rescued?

487
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,586
Who's been rescued?

488
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:06,420
We perhaps?

489
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,254
Show me the island.

490
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:08,673
Show me where does it lie in the ocean.

491
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,840
Show it to me.

492
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:12,218
- By the time they find
us we'll all be dead.

493
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,637
You, you, and you, one after the other.

494
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,188
Babs!

495
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:17,598
Get a hold of yourself.

496
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,601
You're only getting all
the girls worked up.

497
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:22,812
Well, if it isn't Miss Georgia.

498
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,981
Of all people it has to be you.

499
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,700
Who has Gary and Linda
on her conscience, who?

500
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,737
Babs, do you know what you're saying?

501
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:34,073
Exactly, through your jealousy.

502
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,992
You should never have left
Linda alone in the cabin.

503
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,826
Shut up, will you?

504
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,327
What can Georgia do about Linda's death?

505
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:41,372
- Take your hands off me
or I'll break your arm.

506
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,457
Just you try that baby, take that.

507
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,008
Oh!

508
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,636
Oh you.

509
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:56,604
Nelly, leave her alone.

510
00:41:59,474 --> 00:42:00,599
Stop it!

511
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,694
Babs, Nelly, stop it!

512
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:05,813
I got you.

513
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,364
Get off!

514
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:18,242
Babs!

515
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:21,504
Stay here, let her fight.

516
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:27,634
Oh no, no.

517
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,140
So help me.

518
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,728
Come here.

519
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,607
No!

520
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,913
Leave me alone.

521
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:21,022
Come, come.

522
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:24,141
Is the ship getting any closer?

523
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:24,975
I don't know.

524
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:26,644
Come on, throw it on.

525
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,770
Should I get some more?

526
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,355
No, no, that's enough.

527
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,074
That's giving enough smoke.

528
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:34,860
They must see us.

529
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:37,238
They can't just leave us here.

530
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,789
Hello, hello.

531
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:40,282
Stop all that screaming, Ann.

532
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:41,534
You're driving me crazy.

533
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,910
Let me go.

534
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:44,921
Hello, take us with you.

535
00:43:46,873 --> 00:43:49,467
Hello, we're over here.

536
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:52,503
Please don't forget us.

537
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,588
Yell with me.

538
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:56,423
They must hear us.

539
00:43:56,424 --> 00:43:58,351
Hello, hello there.

540
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:00,478
Take us with you.

541
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,482
May, it sailed right by.

542
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,483
It sailed by.

543
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:14,826
We'll never get home now, never again.

544
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,453
28 days,

545
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:21,499
28 long days and nights.

546
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:25,703
And nobody even knows we're here.

547
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:29,882
And today a ship sails right
by us, our rescue so close.

548
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,759
Ann, May.

549
00:44:33,795 --> 00:44:35,504
Oh, Georgia, a ship.

550
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:37,506
There, a ship.

551
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:38,632
Oh, it's gone.

552
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:39,758
How terrible.

553
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:42,562
And we only have enough
food left for three days.

554
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,690
Ann, Ann.

555
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,642
Come on back.

556
00:44:48,643 --> 00:44:50,193
Come on.

557
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:13,042
- Here, you go
ahead and start unloading.

558
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,251
I'll take the oars up.

559
00:45:14,252 --> 00:45:15,802
Okay, Bob.

560
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,561
What are you carrying
the oars so far away for?

561
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,846
Think the mermaids will steal our boat?

562
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,973
Oh, don't talk to me about women

563
00:45:27,974 --> 00:45:29,901
on this godforsaken island.

564
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,520
- You should have taken one
along as part of your rations.

565
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:36,449
I wanted to, but it wasn't approved.

566
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,530
- Hey, come on over here
and give me a hand, will ya?

567
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,124
Okay, I'm coming.

568
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:47,125
Take it easy.

569
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:50,204
Easy now, easy does it.

570
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,298
Boy, that junk is heavy.

571
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,669
- Bob, you know, I'm sort
of glad the professor

572
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,796
picked us out to help him with his work,

573
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,057
even though it's lonely over here.

574
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,267
Give me some whiskey.

575
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,847
If there aren't any chicks,
then at least some whiskey.

576
00:46:08,848 --> 00:46:11,317
You only think about whiskey and women.

577
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,821
You better change or
you'll never get anyplace.

578
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:17,022
Get off my back.

579
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:18,857
I'm sick of your preaching.

580
00:46:18,858 --> 00:46:21,360
Take the professor, for example.

581
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,871
Ah, that guy's always been lucky.

582
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,491
While we explore all sorts
of islands for six months,

583
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:30,536
he comes with us once
and finds this stuff,

584
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,705
and of all places, on
this miserable island.

585
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,539
Oh, careful now.

586
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,374
Stop grumbling, will ya?

587
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:39,628
Oh, go on.

588
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:41,588
I'll go and look for the professor now.

589
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:44,466
Okay, get on out of here, will ya?

590
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,051
In the meantime, I'll unload.

591
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,728
And have fun.

592
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,814
Yeah, sure.

593
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:38,080
Gladys, Gladys.

594
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,540
Quick, girls, we're in danger.

595
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,091
Make for the beach.

596
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,502
We can't leave her here.

597
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,129
So that all of us will be killed?

598
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,847
Let's go, come on.

599
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,030
Look over there.

600
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:26,387
How terrible, the web in the cabin.

601
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,181
The gun.

602
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,561
Gary took it with him that night.

603
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,822
And this is his bracelet.

604
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,614
But where is Gary?

605
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,365
Please, Georgia, let's go.

606
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:57,284
I'm so afraid.

607
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,503
Perhaps there are more spiders around.

608
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,337
Come and sit with me.

609
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,547
What do you want from me?

610
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:12,892
Well, give you three guesses.

611
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,855
I was going to ask ya for the time.

612
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,078
Georgia.

613
00:50:33,404 --> 00:50:34,363
Georgia.

614
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,572
- Georgia.
- Georgia.

615
00:50:35,573 --> 00:50:36,406
Here we are.

616
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:38,283
- Gladys is
gone down by the lagoon.

617
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:39,201
We were swimming when suddenly

618
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,202
she was pulled into the reeds.

619
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,495
And she screamed terribly.

620
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,329
Who was it?

621
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,247
Didn't you see anyone?

622
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,081
No, it all happened so quickly.

623
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:44,915
A scream...

624
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,832
And she'd already disappeared.

625
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,919
- Maybe the spider killed
the professor and Linda.

626
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,672
We found a gigantic spider, dead.

627
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,049
- It was shot with the
professor's own revolver.

628
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,342
- And Gary's bracelet was
laying there beside it.

629
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,895
Ssh, what's that noise?

630
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,610
That's him, get back, quiet.

631
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:07,813
Hands up!
â Hm?

632
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,364
Stop or I'll shoot.

633
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,195
Hey, hello, baby.

634
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:16,746
Hands up!

635
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:18,991
Anything you wish.

636
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,492
Get going into the cabin.

637
00:51:20,493 --> 00:51:21,326
What a coincidence.

638
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:22,160
That's where I wanted to go.

639
00:51:22,161 --> 00:51:23,879
I said get going.

640
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:26,339
All righty.

641
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,752
I think he's handsome.

642
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,671
He doesn't look so terrible.

643
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,840
They're the really dangerous ones.

644
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,391
Too bad.

645
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:42,982
Okay, turn around.

646
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,017
Mm.

647
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,568
Where's Gladys?

648
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:48,562
What did you do with her?

649
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,113
Let me speak to him.

650
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,149
Where is Gladys?

651
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,734
Gladys?

652
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,193
No idea.

653
00:51:55,194 --> 00:51:57,154
I don't know the young lady unfortunately.

654
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,823
We just got here down on the lagoon.

655
00:51:59,824 --> 00:52:01,783
- You see, Georgia?
- Where we were swimming.

656
00:52:01,784 --> 00:52:04,119
And that's where Gladys disappeared.

657
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,670
On the lagoon?

658
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,716
Ah.

659
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,340
Don't laugh.

660
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,216
You'll be sorry about that.

661
00:52:18,217 --> 00:52:20,093
Oh, I don't know.

662
00:52:20,094 --> 00:52:22,479
Just look at what's coming down the path.

663
00:52:29,103 --> 00:52:31,113
- Gladys.
- Oh, Gladys.

664
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:37,110
Where have you been?

665
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:38,278
Who's that?

666
00:52:38,279 --> 00:52:40,238
My friend, Bob.

667
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,491
We work together for Professor Green.

668
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,660
Why, he's a big uranium research man.

669
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,079
I met him before in the reeds.

670
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,215
A researching researcher.

671
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,376
Then you had better luck than I.

672
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,086
I was nearly shot.
- Hi there.

673
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,722
- That is, if the
revolver had been loaded.

674
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,132
And you?

675
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:00,550
You here on a summer vacation?

676
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:02,886
Hm, fine summer vacation.

677
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:04,054
If we hadn't found this island

678
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,806
we wouldn't be here to tell the story.

679
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,725
We crashed on our way to Singapore.

680
00:53:08,726 --> 00:53:11,311
- Ah, then you're the American
dance troop that got lost?

681
00:53:11,312 --> 00:53:12,562
Yes.

682
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:13,438
Well how do you know that?

683
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:14,606
Oh, all the newspapers in the world

684
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:15,440
have carried your story.

685
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,566
What?

686
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:18,026
I bet Professor Green was surprised

687
00:53:18,027 --> 00:53:20,654
when all these girls showed up.

688
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,781
Professor Green is dead.

689
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,408
What with the professor, dead?

690
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,283
What?

691
00:53:25,284 --> 00:53:27,035
He was hanging in a huge spider web.

692
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:28,704
That's how we found him.

693
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,747
Linda is dead, and Gary, our manager,

694
00:53:30,748 --> 00:53:32,124
has also disappeared.

695
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,667
Spider web?

696
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,168
Do you really believe that?

697
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:38,213
- By the way, our ship is
coming back in two days.

698
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,673
We must radio information right away

699
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,217
so that they can sent an
agent to clear the matter up.

700
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,802
You mean it, a ship's coming by.

701
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,303
Our expedition ship.

702
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:46,221
And will take us with it?

703
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,264
Yeah, of course.

704
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,399
- We're rescued.
- Yeah.

705
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:01,027
Look, isn't this pretty?

706
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:02,362
The boys will be surprised

707
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,864
when they see how we've
dressed ourselves up

708
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,582
in our island costumes.

709
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,911
And they promised us real whiskey, kids.

710
00:54:09,912 --> 00:54:11,621
I can hardly wait.

711
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:12,456
Hold this.

712
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,623
Shall I put this in my hair?

713
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:16,042
- You look great, just
like a real islander.

714
00:54:16,043 --> 00:54:16,877
Well I am.

715
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,462
Haven't I been here for four weeks?

716
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,505
- I can't believe that
we'll be back in New York

717
00:54:20,506 --> 00:54:21,465
in a couple of days.

718
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,800
- When we tell them at home
what has happened to us,

719
00:54:23,801 --> 00:54:25,594
nobody's going to believe us.

720
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,012
Where are Georgia and Ann?

721
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,555
Outside on the veranda.

722
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:29,556
They're out there with Joe

723
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,601
trying to make radio contact
with the expedition ship.

724
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,935
I wonder if a lot of reporters

725
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,896
will be on board when we get there.

726
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:38,064
- Hope so.
- Uh-huh.

727
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:40,400
- What's important for
me is that Jimmy's there.

728
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:41,526
Who is Jimmy?

729
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:42,360
My friend.

730
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:44,112
We're going to be married.

731
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:45,697
What if he's got eyes for another?

732
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:47,449
You don't believe that yourself.

733
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,878
I'd scratch his eyes out, and he knows it.

734
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,121
- Kids, we made radio
contact with the ship

735
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:54,831
and we'll be picked up tomorrow.

736
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:57,634
- And tonight we'll dance
and really raise the roof.

737
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,428
Tell me, what kind of a girl is Ann?

738
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:53,098
Usually quiet and one of the nicest.

739
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,934
She's away from home for the first time.

740
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,861
Her folks live in Minnesota.

741
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:04,243
I've never seen her so relaxed.

742
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,488
I'd like to dance with her.

743
00:56:08,489 --> 00:56:10,039
Mm-hm.

744
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,627
- Come on, Bobby, I want
to be all alone with you.

745
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,628
How about the house?

746
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:05,462
Not in the house.

747
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,464
Some place where we'll be all alone.

748
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,590
You know what?

749
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,716
We'll meet at the lagoon.

750
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,717
Okay.

751
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,010
But so that no one will notice.

752
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,178
Good.

753
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,805
We'll meet in 15 minutes on
the trail down to the water.

754
00:57:15,806 --> 00:57:17,816
All set?
- Of course.

755
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:20,518
Oh, but be on time.

756
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:22,069
I hate waiting.

757
00:57:32,156 --> 00:57:33,706
Thanks.

758
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:42,341
Having a good time with the chicks?

759
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,885
Shut your mouth.

760
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,848
Fallen for her?

761
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:07,448
Thank you.

762
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,751
Tell me, are you always so quiet?

763
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:22,330
- You know, when you've lived
on islands for a long time

764
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:24,582
you forget how to say
nice things to girls.

765
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,176
Well, try it once.

766
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,423
- Well, I'm really glad
that your airplane crashed.

767
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,049
Well, that's a nice thing to say.

768
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,980
- I mean, otherwise I wouldn't
have gotten to know you.

769
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:40,765
And I'm glad about that.

770
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:42,684
Oh, you say that to everybody.

771
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,237
No, I don't know any girls.

772
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,398
When I think of the ones
I do, I'd rather work.

773
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,983
Well, I must say, you certainly are

774
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,868
a master at paying compliments.

775
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,447
Perhaps you're right.

776
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,125
I should pay more
attention to young women.

777
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,786
Sometimes I envy Bob.

778
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:04,497
He's so uninhibited and carefree.

779
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:05,331
Bobby.

780
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:07,384
Any girl is good enough for him.

781
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:13,798
A real man is interested in only one girl.

782
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:16,852
Then I'm a real man.

783
00:59:17,386 --> 00:59:18,936
How?

784
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,642
- Because I'm really
interested only in one girl.

785
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:25,602
Who's that?

786
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,145
What does she look like?

787
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,646
Cute, elegant?

788
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,649
Elegant, mm, on the contrary.

789
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,235
A little bit disheveled and neglected,

790
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:37,789
but very pretty.

791
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,291
Her name's Ann.

792
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:43,995
Oh, Joe, that's one of the nicest things

793
00:59:43,996 --> 00:59:46,081
that's ever been said to me.

794
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,716
Well I meant it.

795
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:50,510
I'm really fond of you.

796
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,975
You know, when you leave
for New York, here,

797
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:00,187
so you won't forget me too quickly.

798
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:06,902
- But, Joe, please don't
let me wait too long.

799
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,898
Come on, I got 12 minutes left.

800
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,566
What's in 12 minutes?

801
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:14,943
My next rendezvous.

802
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,119
Oh.

803
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:23,752
Hello, big boy.

804
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,288
Well, I'll be darned.

805
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:29,216
That's not bad either.

806
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:44,022
Hey, all right, you really
don't know where to start here.

807
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,787
Gladys.

808
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,539
Oh, you're here.

809
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,216
What's on your mind, huh?

810
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,875
Nothing.

811
01:05:22,876 --> 01:05:24,426
In love?

812
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,337
Mm-hm.

813
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:29,641
- And you really think that
Bobby's the right man for you?

814
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:33,143
I don't know.

815
01:05:34,179 --> 01:05:37,190
I only know one thing, I love him.

816
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:41,060
I hope he doesn't let you down.

817
01:05:41,061 --> 01:05:42,862
I'd be very sorry for you.

818
01:05:48,485 --> 01:05:50,236
Hello daddy-o.

819
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,654
How about throwing those lamps

820
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:53,656
on somebody else for a change?

821
01:05:53,657 --> 01:05:56,084
Yeah, baby, like you swing too.

822
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:08,337
Come on, Gladys.

823
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:09,797
It's not worth it.

824
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:11,641
Don't bother me.

825
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:21,601
Hey, Georgia, give me a drink too.

826
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:22,935
All right.

827
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:24,020
Thanks.

828
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,271
- Bobby.
- Yeah?

829
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,440
- Do you have to turn
all the girls' heads?

830
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,316
Who me?

831
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,867
They turn mine.

832
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,113
- Hi, Georgia.
- Hi.

833
01:06:34,114 --> 01:06:36,199
That dance sure made me thirsty.

834
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,243
- Georgia, aren't you at all
excited about going home soon?

835
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:40,077
Mm-hm.

836
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:40,912
Okay, let's drink to that.

837
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:41,746
Yeah.

838
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:42,580
Well, here's to the trip.

839
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,539
Cheers.

840
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,090
Cheers.

841
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,920
- Do you think people are
still talking about us?

842
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:49,754
Of course.

843
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,256
Now all the more, since we found you.

844
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:53,633
Will the papers print our story?

845
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:56,469
- Oh, baby, will the
papers print your story?

846
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,262
The magazines will carry your pictures.

847
01:06:58,263 --> 01:07:01,191
And what do you think radio
and TV will do with you?

848
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,392
You'll be amazed at the reception

849
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:05,153
you'll get back in New York.

850
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,523
Maybe they'll drive us down Broadway,

851
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,815
with confetti and all.

852
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:10,900
Mm.

853
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,777
In any case, you become
a world famous troop

854
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,904
and hm, who knows?

855
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:17,114
Maybe you'll wind up in Hollywood.

856
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:19,501
Oh, Bobby, I might make it yet.

857
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,787
- Thank goodness I still
have a few minutes left.

858
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:26,007
'Cause my next rendezvous
is very important.

859
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,751
And this time who's the lucky one?

860
01:07:28,752 --> 01:07:32,680
If you won't tell anyone, Gladys.

861
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:35,383
- Bobby
- Hm?

862
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,385
Gladys is a fine girl.

863
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,804
Up until now she's been shy of men.

864
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,640
Please, leave her alone.

865
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,191
Exactly.

866
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,979
I've always yearned for a girl like this

867
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,656
and never found one.

868
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,077
And why am I telling you all this anyway?

869
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,254
Oh, Joe, I'm so happy.

870
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,922
Well, that's what I expected.

871
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,215
Same old story.

872
01:08:16,216 --> 01:08:17,133
You're nice to a man

873
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,364
and before you know it he's getting fresh.

874
01:08:21,513 --> 01:08:23,556
- Ann, I must tell you
something right away.

875
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:25,275
Come on.
- All right.

876
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,818
Hey, Ann.

877
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,689
Let her run.

878
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,441
They're all good for nothing.

879
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,992
They're all the same.

880
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,538
Come on, let's have a drink.

881
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,872
- Well, Gladys, it's just
as I told you earlier.

882
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,999
Don't you see that Bob
is just the kind of man

883
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,136
who wants nothing else than
to play around with women

884
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,931
without a single serious
thought in his head?

885
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,800
- You're right, I don't
want to see him again.

886
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,351
Gladys.

887
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:08,225
Look, Bob, you can keep those remarks

888
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:10,111
about Arm to yourself, get it?

889
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,244
Don't tell me you're serious, fella.

890
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,156
You haven't fallen for that
little broad, by any chance?

891
01:09:22,157 --> 01:09:23,707
Well, good luck then.

892
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:26,419
And what if I were?

893
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:29,130
Then I'd feel sorry for you.

894
01:09:30,248 --> 01:09:32,500
What are dancers?

895
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,719
Hot goods for cold nights.

896
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,847
Or do you think your Ann is different, hm?

897
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,049
For a guy like you, the worst girl

898
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,268
in the world is too good.

899
01:09:51,186 --> 01:09:53,521
No, not here.

900
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,072
Come on.

901
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,270
Take that.

902
01:10:52,205 --> 01:10:53,164
I gotta run.

903
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,882
I got a date.
- Okay.

904
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,735
Hello, Gladys.

905
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,662
Oh, leave me alone you.

906
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,990
What's the matter with you, kid?

907
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,450
Have you gone crazy?

908
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,118
You ask me that.

909
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:33,662
No man in this world, even if he belonged

910
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:36,549
to your best friend, would
be safe with you around.

911
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,093
Are you talking about Bobby?

912
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:41,045
Who else?

913
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,797
But you can keep him.

914
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,348
I'm through with him.

915
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:46,851
I've got news for you.

916
01:11:47,677 --> 01:11:49,845
Bobby just made it clear to me

917
01:11:49,846 --> 01:11:53,057
that you're the kind of girl
that he's been looking for.

918
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,892
Do you mean that, Babs?

919
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:58,020
- If it weren't true, do
you think I'd leave him?

920
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,480
Babs!

921
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,116
Go to him, he's waiting for you.

922
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:53,311
Bobby.

923
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:16,834
That was a scream, ssh.

924
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:22,456
It sounded like Gladys.

925
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:24,007
And Bobby's also gone.

926
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,167
I'll look for them.

927
01:14:25,168 --> 01:14:26,918
You get dressed and follow me.

928
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:40,576
Oh.

929
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:42,161
You go up ahead and try and help Gladys.

930
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:43,662
I'll go back and get the ammunition.

931
01:15:43,663 --> 01:15:45,213
Quick.

932
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,250
Bob.

933
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,133
Bobby.

934
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:15,638
- Joe.
- Georgia.

935
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:17,840
Where's the ammunition?

936
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,558
I don't know, maybe there.

937
01:17:21,636 --> 01:17:23,387
Quick, or we'll all get it.

938
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,231
I found Bob, dead.

939
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,182
Was he strangled?

940
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:28,943
Where are the bullets?

941
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:31,520
It's too late.

942
01:17:31,521 --> 01:17:32,780
He's here.

943
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:03,893
Gary.

944
01:18:41,257 --> 01:18:42,807
No.

945
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,744
Wait, each of you take a torch,

946
01:19:10,745 --> 01:19:11,995
then we'll chase him.

947
01:19:11,996 --> 01:19:14,173
We can only destroy him with fire.

948
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:16,625
Here.

949
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,176
Oh, light mine.

950
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,890
All right, come on.

951
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:27,886
Come on.

952
01:19:27,887 --> 01:19:29,437
We must surround him.

953
01:19:29,806 --> 01:19:31,265
Two of you take that path over there.

954
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,183
Two go through the bushes.

955
01:19:33,184 --> 01:19:34,768
The rest of you, come with me.

956
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:35,811
Nobody should go alone.

957
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:37,437
Always go in pairs.

958
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:38,614
Come on.

959
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:09,186
Come on, he's over there.

960
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:39,800
Come, there he is.

961
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,434
Maybe we've lost him.

962
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,920
Stop, the quicksand starts here.

963
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,729
Oh, Joe, he's sinking.

964
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:49,054
Better dead than continue living.

965
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:32,181
Come on, girls, Babs, Kate.
