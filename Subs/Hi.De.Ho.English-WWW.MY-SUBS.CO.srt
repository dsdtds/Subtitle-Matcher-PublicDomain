00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,600

3
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Coming right out, dear.

4
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
Freshen up this drink.

5
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
What's the matter, Cab?

6
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
Are ya blind?

7
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Don't you see anything?

8
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes, I see something.

9
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,600
I see that my drink
needs freshening up.

10
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Okay, Cab.

11
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I'll fix your drink for you.

12
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
But how about singing that song
you wrote about me?

13
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
My song.

14
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,800
And sing it
like you really meant it,

15
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
huh, Cab?

16
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Sure, Minnie, sure.

17
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Minnie's a hep cat now

18
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,600
She's as sharp
as the cats allow

19
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,200
Say, she's really up to date

20
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,400
when she's topped out
in her drape

21
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,600
Minnie's a hep cat now

22
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Whoa, there ain't
no more Smoky Joe

23
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,200
She's fluffed off
his hi-de-ho

24
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,400
She's a solid jitterbug
when she starts to cut a rug

25
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, Minnie's a hep cat now

26
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Minnie's a hep cat now

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
Thanks.

28
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
You ain't sung it with feeling
since that gal Nettie

29
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
took an interest in you.

30
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll see you dead
before I let anyone

31
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
take you from me.

32
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,400
I'll get it.

33
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
Hi, Nettie.

34
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
Come in, Nettie.

35
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
Uh, no thanks, Cab.

36
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I've got something important
to tell you,

37
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,800
then I must run.

38
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, give, honey, give,
I'm all ears.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
Well, you'd better be
all voice

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
because I've arranged
an audition for you tonight

41
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
at 6:00.

42
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,200
I'll bring along
a good booking agent,

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
also the proprietor
of the little jive club

44
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
up here to hear you then.

45
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,400
Little jive club?

46
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, I know it's not big,
but it's a start.

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
Remember, a journey
of a thousand miles

48
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
begin with but a single step.

49
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
Well, I appreciate it, Nettie.

50
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Uh, so tell me what to do,
Manager.

51
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Well, you have your boys ready.

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,600
Have them up here
for the audition

53
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
at 6:00 tonight.

54
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I'll be ready at 6:00.

55
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Cab, can't you see that gal
is a first-class moocher?

56
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
She's not the moocher.

57
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
It's you, Minnie.

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes, my dear, you,
Minnie the Moocher.

59
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,600
She's trying to take you
away from me.

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Don't be silly, Minnie.

61
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Nettie's interest in me
is strictly business.

62
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,000
She's trying to help me
make a success of things.

63
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Success means money,
and money means trouble.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Aren't you happy with me
like this, Cab?

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,200
Cab, if you walk out on me now,
you'll be sorry.

66
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, Minnie, behave.

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
I gotta go get
the boys together

68
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,800
for an audition here at 6:00.

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,600
You grab me
before I get my dinner down

70
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Jack, we started in
poppin' all around the town

71
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,000
To me it's solid labor,

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the jive you think is fun

73
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,600
You forget about romance
when labor's done

74
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,200
Dancin'

75
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,200
You're always dancin'

76
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
without romancin"

77
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
till dawn time

78
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Laggin'

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
My feet are laggin'

80
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,600
My heart is draggin'

81
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,600
at dawn time

82
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Before you realize,

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
the moon will leave the skies

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,200
And when the sun
shines up above

85
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
that ain't no time to love

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Dawn time.

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,600
I think it's our time

88
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,200
to say you'll be mine

89
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,600
at dawn time

90
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,200
Before you realize,

91
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,200
the moon will leave the skies

92
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,800
And when the sun's shining
up above,

93
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,200
that ain't no time to love

94
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,000
Dawn time

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think it's our time

96
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,800
to say you'll be mine

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,600
at dawn time

98
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,000
Dawn time

99
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,600
At dawn time

100
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
You wanna hear another?

101
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Sure, why not?

102
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Livin' and the jive is right

103
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,400
Livin'

104
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Oh, tonight's the night

105
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Give it

106
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, tonight's the night

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
Come on, old man, come on

108
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,800

You gotta come on like G.I.

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
You dig the repeat
from me, sigh

114
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
You put it
right on the Lehigh

115
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Then you can really get by,
oh my

116
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
We the cats shall hep ya

Oh, you reap

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
You didn't tell me
he was this good.

121
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Well, I didn't know it myself.

122
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
We the cats shall hep ya

123
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Oh, you reap

124

You gotta come on like G.I.

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,600
You dig the repeat

128
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You put it

129
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Then you can really get by,

Oh, you reap
this righteous riff

134
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
This guy Calloway is great,

135
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,000
just what the doctor ordered
for the Brass Hat Club.

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,400
You said it,
and that's where he belong,

137
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
not in a little jive spot.

138
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,600
And the Brass Hat Club
will be in a tough spot

139
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
when Boss Mason opens
his New York-type club

140
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
across the street from him

141
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
if they don't have
a good band

142
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,400
to hold the business.

143
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
But, well, Boss Mason
is a tough racketeer.

144
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
It would be dynamite
to mess up with him.

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't worry, I'll let
his manager do the messing up.

146
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, you gotta come on like G.I.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,800
You dig the repeat
from me, sigh

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
You put it right
on the Lehigh

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Then you can really get by,
oh my

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,400
We the cats shall hep ya

151
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,600
Oh, you reap
this righteous riff

152
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Bop-bop

153
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
Now you're hep, I'll bet ya

154
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:13,600
This righteous riff

155
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
Mr. Calloway,

156
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
we have a business proposition
to make you.

157
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Business proposition?

158
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,600
Well, you see, fellas,
I have a manager now

159
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
and she takes care of
all the business propositions.

160
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Gentlemen, my manager.

161
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,400
I'll fix him.

162
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
Come in.

163
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,200
If you're through lookin',
now listen.

164
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,600
May I see the proprietor?

165
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
The which?

166
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,000
The gentleman who owns
this establishment.

167
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,800
Oh, you mean the guy
that runs the joint.

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
Right this way, lady.

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,200
All right, so Calloway's
out of this world

170
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,400
and it's liable to put me
out of business.

171
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,800
So what do you want me
to do about it?

172
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,000
What he's got there
ain't no tumor.

173
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
You know, I like you.

174
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Huh, Mo?

175
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, maybe she's got
a friend for me.

176
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Listen, stupid,

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,400
this is no laughing matter.

178
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Wait a minute, sister.

179
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,400
Nobody talks to the boss
that way.

180
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
No one but her.

181
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
Sit down, Mo.

182
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Tell me, sister,
just what do you do?

183
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,800
When I work, I sing.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,400
Yeah?

185
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
And I bet
you're pretty good at it.

186
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,000
And, um, we can get
more musicians

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,200
and call it
Cab Calloway and His Band.

188
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
But Mason is opening up
in two days.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Can Calloway be ready by then?

190
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,200
They'll be right up there
on the bandstand

191
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,000
packing 'em in.

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
You're right, Nettie.

193
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,600
People start for Mason's club.

194
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
When they hear Calloway's music,

195
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
they head right in here.

196
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,600
Boy, I bet Mason is burning up.

197
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,800
Minnie was right.

198
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,000
We should've bumped Calloway off
before tonight.

199
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm lonesome out there.

200
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Not a customer in the joint.

201
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Hey, Mo,

202
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,800
why don't you go over there
and rub out Calloway?

203
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,400
That'll stop the music.

204
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Then everybody will flock
in here.

205
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
That's a good idea, Minnie.

206
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,600
I give orders around here,
no one else.

207
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,200
Don't listen to that
big bag of wind, Mo.

208
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
Do as I tell ya.

209
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
Listen, you!

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
You better watch your step.

211
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,600
-Oh, I know what I'm doing.
-Shut up!

212
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
-Come with me, Mo.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
You want to see me?

214
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
Yes, on business.

215
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,800
Oh, business.

216
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Well, I'll call my manager.

217
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Nettie, my manager.

218
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm Mason.

219
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,400
This is Mo, the Mouse.

220
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
How do you do, uh, gentlemen?

221
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,800
If you and your boys will come
across the street to my place,

222
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
I'll pay you double
what you're getting here.

223
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,800
Not interested.

224
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
Don't be too hasty
with your decision.

225
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
Think it over.

226
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I'll be in my office
waiting for your answer.

227
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll give you half an hour
to make up your mind.

228
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
It better be yes.

229
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,000
Cab, I'm scared.

230
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,800
Ah, he's bluffing, Nettie.

231
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Let's get a load
of this next act.

232
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
You could stand a good laugh.

233
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Oh, Dusty Fletcher.

234
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,800
I ain't drunk!
I ain't drunk, man!

235
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,400
-I ain't drunk!
-Get out of here!

236
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,600
Get out of that bar!

237
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
I told you about coming in
and stealing whiskey on the bar

238
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,400
every time somebody
turn their back!

239
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
- I didn't steal...
-You did steal the whiskey!

240
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
If I catch you in there again,
I'll kick your teeth out

241
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
one by one!

242
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,400
-No, you won't.
-No, I what?

243
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,000
I said, "Yes, you will."

244
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,800
Listen, I'm a bad bean
from Boston,

245
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,400
and I was born
with boxing gloves on.

246
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah, and you keep
messing with me

247
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,800
and you gonna die
the same way too.

248
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Got him telling me he's
a bad bean from Boston.

249
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,000
When I get through with him,
he'll be a has-been.

250
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll go back and break up
his joint.

251
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Getting mad 'cause I won't
buy no drinks.

252
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,000
Ain't no use in me buying
when everybody else is buying.

253
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,800
I ain't been buying no liquor
and I ain't gonna start now.

254
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm gonna keep on drinking
to everybody's health

255
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,800
until I ruin my own.

256
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,400
Yeah, he comes grabbing me
in the collar.

257
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
Well, he won't grab nobody else

258
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,800
"cause I'm going back
and relieve him

259
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
of his grabbles,
that's what I'm gonna do.

260
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah, I'll break up his joint.

261
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,600
Yeah, I'll break it up!

262
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll stick a match
to your joint,

263
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,000
burn it down to the ground.

264
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't tell me
how to live my life.

265
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,400
I'll--me, I'd run him
out of town.

266
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
Run him out of town!

267
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll run him as long as he can
find something to step on.

268
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,400
He gonna tell me something.

269
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,200
I'll go back and run him
back to--

270
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
I'll go--I'll go back
in there...

271
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Well, I ain't going back today,

272
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
but I'm gonna try
to make it tomorrow.

273
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And tomorrow at 2:00.

274
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm going on home
and get me some sleep.

275
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
I got to get off the street
'cause I don't want my pastor

276
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,800
to see me like this.

277
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Yeah, you have to be
so careful these days

278
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
"cause people are so quick

279
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
to scandalize your name.

280
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,200
And I don't think my name
would stand

281
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,600
in the most scandalized.

282
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
So I'm gonna
get on in the house

283
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,600
and get me some sleep,
that's what I need.

284
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,800
I'll get on it.

285
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,000
You know, that's a shame.

286
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,600
I know I ain't drunk.

287
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,000
Just that whiskey is heavy,
that's all.

288
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
They ought to stop people
from drinking whiskey

289
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
and they're haggard.

290
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,400
Get drunk
and it makes you act so common.

291
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,400
And I know I ain't common
"cause I got some class

292
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,000
I ain't never used yet.

293
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,600
He's gonna tell me something
about Green River Street.

294
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,000
I know about that street.

295
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
Like I told a boy
last Saturday night, I...

296
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
Yeah.

297
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It ain't no use.

298
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Yes, I'll get in the house here
and wake up everybody

299
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
so I can go to sleep.

300
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
That's the way I do that,
you know.

301
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,600
...but I see him--

302
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
I better... I see him.

303
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
All right,
open the door, Richard.

304
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
That's the boy I rooms with.

305
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
Now what's the matter with him?

306
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Hey, open that door up there,
Richard!

307
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Now I know he ain't
gone out nowhere,

308
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
'cause I got on the clothes.

309
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Now what's the matter with him?

310
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,600
Hey, open the door, Richard!

311
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,000
That's the reason I don't like
to room with nobody.

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
He don't want
to open the door for me,

313
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
and I owe just as much rent
up there as he do.

314
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
I think I'm gonna move
next Saturday,

315
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,600
"cause this old woman,

316
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
she chargin'
too much rent anyhow.

317
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Three dollars a month.

318
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah, and got the nerve
to be mad

319
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,400
because we're 11 months
in arrears.

320
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,000
Why, she come askin' me
this mornin', she said,

321
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,600
"When you boys gwine give me
some of my back rent?"

322
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,000
I just told her she lucky
she gettin' the front rent

323
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
outta me.

324
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Aw, why don't you open the door,
Richard?

325
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,600
Then, she come askin' me
when I'se gwine to work,

326
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
and I ain't thinkin'
'bout no work.

327
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't want no job.

328
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,800
I'm goin' back on relief Monday.

329
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,400
I was on relief last summer,
but I don't know,

330
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
they got short of help

331
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
and they couldn't send
your checks out,

332
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
and you hadda go get 'em
and all that,

333
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,600
so I put it down.

334
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,200
What'cha gonna do
"bout the door, Richard?

335
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,600
I don't think
he gonna do nothin'.

336
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
But I'll get in.

337
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,800
I'll go around
through the back

338
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
and I'll come 'round
through the alley.

339
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,400
I don't need no Richard
to open no door.

340
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,200
I just didn't want a be walkin'
in no dark alleys

341
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
this time of night.

342
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm walkin' in the alley

343
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and somebody stick me up.

344
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,400
I got to get hurt
'cause I has nothin' to offer.

345
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,000
So I gotta get on in the house.

346
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I've got to get a little sleep,
I know I do.

347
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Now you know I ain't never
drank no whiskey before

348
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
that won't let you go
nowhere.

349
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
Here, here's another thing!

350
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
You keep this ladder
out of this bar.

351
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
And you stay out too.

352
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,800
- I didn't bring no ladder.
-You did bring the ladder

353
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
-in there.
-Cab Calloway brought it.

354
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
I don't care who brought
the ladder in there.

355
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,800
You keep it out.

356
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

357
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,200
Okay with me, pal.

358
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,600
It's all right with me.

359
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
You tell me
if I can keep it out.

360
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,400
All right, did you tell...

361
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,000
give me half a pint of whiskey,
did you tell her that?

362
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Did you tell her that?

363
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
-Come on, give me--
-Listen.

364
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,600
Dusty, you didn't paint
no kitchen.

365
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
What did you do with the paint
I had in that bottle?

366
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,200
Yeah, I did!

367
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,000
What was that?

368
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
What did you do with the paint
I had in that bottle?

369
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Paint?

370
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,400
Was there paint
in that bottle?

371
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh, man, you should
have told me 'fore now.

372
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
You put paint
in a whiskey bottle

373
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
and set it in front of me?

374
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,000
Well, get me
some paint remover then.

375
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
I'll drink that.

376
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,200
-Come on, get--
-Listen, Dusty.

377
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Why don't you get yourself
a job and go to work?

378
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,600
No, you--what is that?

379
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Why don't you get yourself
a job and go to work?

380
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,400
Me? Go to work?

381
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Son, you known me
for a million days, didn't ya?

382
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
You ever known me to work?

383
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
You ever known anybody
who's known me to work?

384
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Well, coincidentally,

385
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,800
did you ever know anybody
who knows somebody

386
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
who thought I'd have ideas
where to work?

387
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,400
Well, don't worry, you won't.

388
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,400
Now, you are impossible!

389
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
I don't care what I am,
I ain't tired.

390
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
He don't tell me how to live.

391
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
Just like I told him
that just...

392
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
Now ain't this somethin'.

393
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,400
Now, this old woman
across the street,

394
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,400
she sees everything that happens
in the neighborhood.

395
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,400
Look at her.

396
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Now she done spied
on me already.

397
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
She done called her sister
to the window for witness.

398
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,800
She wants to make sure
this is me.

399
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,200
She keep on asking her sister,

400
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,400
"Ain't that him?
Ain't that him?"

401
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes, this is me
and I'm drunk again!

402
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,600
I just hope
she says something about me

403
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,400
in the meeting Sunday,

404
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,600
and I'll have her whole family
throwin' eyes at me.

405
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Her husband come out there
last Sunday,

406
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
he was so "ineeberated"...

407
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
"Ineeberated"...

408
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,600
When he got on his knees
to pray, he went to sleep.

409
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,200
I had to sober up right quick
and pray for him.

410
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,600
I ain't got no time
to be prayin' for nobody.

411
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
I got my own soul to sterilize.

412
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,800
But I'm glad you threw
this old ladder out here.

413
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,800
I'll take it
and get on in the house

414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,600
and get a little sleep.

415
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,400
That's what I gotta do.

416
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,400
Don't open the door, Richard.

417
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Ah, don't open no door.

418
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,400
Uh-huh, I don't want you
to open no door.

419
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,600
I don't want you
to do nothin'.

420
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
I'll take my ladder
and climb up on top.

421
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,800
I don't need no Richard.

422
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,400
He want somebody big...

423
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll get in by myself.

424
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,200
I don't need him to tell me
how to live my life.

425
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll climb up on top.

426
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,200
Tell me how to live my life...

427
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
This is my life,
I live my life myself.

428
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,800
I don't need nobody
to tell me.

429
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
How to live my life.

430
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,000
He gonna tell me something.

431
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm coming on up there, Richard.

432
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,600
He gonna say...

433
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I don't need Richard,

434
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,800
I don't need nobody to tell me
how to live my life.

435
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,800
I don't think
I'm gonna be here long, Richard.

436
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
Then he come tellin' me

437
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
...how to live my life,

438
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm high as a Georgia pine.

439
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,000
But it ain't no use
in bein' too high up.

440
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
I get in, I climb up
and tell somebody.

441
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
I didn't know
how to live my life.

442
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
I get it.

443
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I-I don't need Richard.

444
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,600
Oh, why don't you open
that door, Richard?

445
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Here like
we're paying customers.

446
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,400
So we are.

447
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

448
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,600
we'd like to do
a little novel number,

449
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
a tune entitled "Hey Now."

450
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,600
When I say, "Hey now,"

451
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
I want everybody to shout,
"Hey now!"

452
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Come on.

453
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
Hey now!

454
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,600
Good.

455
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,600
Hey now, hey now

456
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I was walkin' up the street,
feelin' bad and bold

457
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,600
Deep down in my pockets
I didn't have no gold

458
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,400
I looked up to the sky,
to my surprise

459
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,000
I saw a million dollar bill
floatin' before my eyes

460
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,400
I said hey now, hey now

461
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,000
Hey now, hey now

462
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
-Hey now!
-Hey now!

463
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,400
I took the million dollars
and began to look for some more

464
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,600
Kept goin' up the street,
this time a little more slower

465
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,600
When I got to the corner,
I started right in to shout

466
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,400
I met a good,
fine little chick

467
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,000
that knew
what life was all about

468
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,600
I dug her,
I said hey now, hey now

469
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,800
I got the things I want
plus a great big car

470
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Every day
I'm getting more popular

471
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Say, Jack, if things go bad,
you don't know what to do

472
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Dig this jive expression,
it will see you through

473
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,600
Just say hey now, hey now

474
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,400
Okay, fellas,
let's take a break.

475
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,200
Oh, Cab, you were wonderful,
they love you.

476
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,400
You do?

477
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
I said "they."

478
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Oh, that's what I thought
you said.

479
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,600
Say, you must be exhausted.

480
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,400
Come on,
you'd better take a rest.

481
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,600
Well, here we are.

482
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,000
That's for you,
and this is for me.

483
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Cab, I do hope
that racketeer Mason

484
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,600
didn't upset you
with his threat.

485
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,600
Nettie, I'm not worried.

486
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,000
Minnie was right.

487
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,400
I sure do miss her.

488
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,200
I've gotta hand it to her,

489
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,000
I was better off
before I started to click.

490
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,400
No headaches.

491
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Look, Cab,

492
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,600
we made this business deal
on a handshake,

493
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,000
so if you want to quit,
I won't hold you to it.

494
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,800
Anyway, you're tired,

495
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,200
so we'll talk business later.

496
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
I'll see you later.

497
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Come in.

498
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Cab.

499
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Minnie.

500
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I was a fool.

501
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
I should have realized
there could be nothing

502
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,600
between you and Nettie
but just business.

503
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,400
Oh, Cab.

504
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,600
I came to warn you. Mason--

505
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Cab, they're yelling for you
out here.

506
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,200
Be right out, Nettie.

507
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,600
But, Cab, you can't.

508
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
You've got--

509
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Don't worry, honey,

510
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm not afraid
of that mug Mason.

511
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,400
Oh, gosh, what shall I do?

512
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
And I tell you,
Mason's gonna kill him!

513
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Well, I'm no undertaker.

514
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
And besides, how do you know
so much about it?

515
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,000
What's the difference?
I just know, that's all.

516
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,600
I guess we had better
do something about that,

517
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,200
and quick too.

518
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,200
Now?

519
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
He has two minutes yet.

520
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,800
-Hey, Cab.
-What's going on around here?

521
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Buddy boy, there's foul play
around these crossroads.

522
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Somebody wants you
to be a dead duck.

523
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,600
Please listen to us, Cab.

524
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,400
Well, my time is up,
I'm still livin'.

525
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,200
Quit worryin', that guy Mason
is only bluff in'.

526
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,600
I guess he thinks I'm bluffing.

527
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
Now, boss?

528
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Yes, now.

529
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,600
Say, you wanted to climb in,

530
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
now I'm helpin' ya.

531
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Come on in here.

532
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,000
Don't shoot me.

533
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,600
Get up there.

534
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
Come on, get up.

535
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Get up.

536
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,000
Yes, but you didn't have to shut
that window on my wrists.

537
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,200
What did you want me to do,
ask you for the gun?

538
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,000
Thank heavens
you're all right, Cab.

539
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Hi, Minnie.

540
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm all right.

541
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
I'm gonna take this guy
straight to the station house.

542
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,000
Come on, let's get going.

543
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
All right, get going,
open the door, Minnie.

544
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,200
Go on, get out.

545
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
-Cab, look out!

546
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
Minnie, darling, speak to me.

547
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,000
Are you badly hurt?

548
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,600
Yes, I think so.

549
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
Put me on the couch in there.

550
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay, boys,
Mason's rubbed out,

551
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and I say good riddance
to bad rubbish.

552
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,600
Take little Mo
down to the station house,

553
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,200
and I hope he never gets out.

554
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,800
Minnie, you saved my life.

555
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,000
Why did you do it?

556
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,000
I figured you'd do something
for me sometime.

557
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Sure, Minnie, anytime.

558
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,600
There isn't much time, Cab.

559
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,400
So will you--
will you sing my song?

560
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
The one you wrote about me.

561
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,200
And sing it like you meant it,
huh, Cab?

562
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,400
Sure, Minnie.

563
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,600
Sure.

564
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,600
Minnie's a hep cat now

565
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,600
She's as sharp
as the cats allow

566
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,600
When she's dressed up
in a drape

567
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,600
Oh, Jack, she's really great

568
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,800
Minnie's a hep cat now

569
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,400
Ten or more Smokey Joe

570
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,600
She done fluffed off
his hi de ho

571
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,600
She's a wild jitterbug

572
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,800
When she starts to cut a rug

573
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:05,000
Minnie's a hep cat now

574
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Put your arms around me, Cab.

575
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Sure, Minnie.

576
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,200
How'd you like
to blow your top

577
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,000
Dig yourself
some fine ree-bop

578
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Hi-de-ho, he-de-he

579
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, the hi-de-ho man,
that's me

580
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,200
Say I hepped 'em in Holland

581
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,800
I hepped 'em in London

582
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,600
I hepped 'em in gay Paris

583
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Yes sirree, yes sirree

584
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
Oh the hi-de-ho man,
that's me

585
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,600
Ain't you glad
you dug my jive

586
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,400
Look out, man,
I'll take that righteous five

587
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh the hi-de-ho man,
that's me

588
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,200
Say, stay solid,
very groovy fella

589
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,000
And then you're gonna be
sharp as me

590
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,400
Yes sirree, yes sirree

591
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,400
Oh the hi-de-ho man,
that's me

592
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:31,200
Man, that's me

593
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,600
Thank you very much.

594
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

595
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,000
I'd like to present to you
the famous Peters Sisters.

596
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,000
Raindrops scatter down
like lovers' tears

597
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,400
My Sunday's not happy,
goodness knows

598
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:29,800
But when it rains,
my cup of sadness overflows

599
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:39,000
A rainy Sunday

600
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,400
A picture of you

601
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:50,600
And nothing to do but dream

602
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:56,400
A rainy Sunday

603
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:09,400
And memories we knew
go by in an endless stream

604
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:22,800
I just can't realize
we're apart

605
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:41,200
The thunder is an echo
of the sorrow in my heart

606
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:48,000
Don't go to movies

607
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,200
Can't finish a book

608
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,000
Keep turning my radio dial

609
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:09,600
For all around me
wherever I look

610
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:20,400
I still see your goodbye smile
in my mind

611
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
I'm resigned

612
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:31,400
I won't find a thing to do

613
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:39,600
On a rainy Sunday
without you

614
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,200
My dear

615
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,600
-In my mind
-In my mind

616
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,400
-I'm resigned
-I'm resigned

617
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:02,600
I won't find a thing to do

618
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:13,200
On a rainy Sunday
without you

619
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:23,000
My dear

620
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Boys and girls,
come on and gather 'round,

621
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,200
cause there's
a brand new dance,

622
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,600
yes, it's hit this town

623
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,200
You can clap your hands,

624
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,000
and you can beat out time

625
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
-and when we're through--
-Jack, it's really fine

626
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,600
Well, look who's here?

627
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,400
-Look who's where?
-Well, how do you do?

628
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,000
Tell me, who are you?

629
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,400
I'm a little old lady
from Baltimore

630
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
From Baltimore?

631
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,000
Yes, from Baltimore

632
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Meet the little old lady
from Baltimore

633
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Well, let's see
what you can do

634
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,600
I'm the hip old lady
from Baltimore

635
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,600
From Baltimore!

636
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,000
Yes, Baltimore

637
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,600
She's a hip old lady
from Baltimore

638
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,000
Well, lead on,
we'll see you through

639
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,200
-Well, au reel.
-Can you dip?

640
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,800
I'm hip to that dip

641
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And the Rain Jane too?

642
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,600
You mean the whole thing, too?

643
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,000
How about the boogie woogie?

644
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,600
I do that too

645
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,400
Oh well, jump back sister
we'll follow you

646
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,400
I'm the little old lady
from Baltimore

647
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,600
-She's from Baltimore
-Yeah, from Baltimore

648
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,200
A little old lady
from Baltimore

649
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,600
And it's groovy

650
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,200
What's groovy?

651
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,600
The thing

652
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,000
What thing?

653
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,600
That I do

654
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,000
Folk, I'm going down
to St. James Infirmary

655
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,000
to see my baby there

656
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:42,400
She's stretched out
on a long white table,

657
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:49,800
SO sweet,
so cold, so fair

658
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,000
Let it go, let it go

659
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,200
God bless her,

660
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,000
wherever she may be

661
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,400
She can search
this whole wide world over,

662
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,400
but she'll never find
another sweet man like me

663
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,600
When I die,

664
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,200
bury me
in my straight-leg britches,

665
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:26,200
put on a box-back coat
and a Stetson hat

666
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,000
Put a 20 dollar gold piece
on my watch chain,

667
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,200
So you can let
all the boys know

668
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,000
I died standing pat

669
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,600
Then give me six
crap-shooting pall bearers

670
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:51,600
Let a chorus girl
sing me a song

671
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:57,400
Put a red hot jazz band
at the top of my head,

672
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,400
SO we can raise
Hallelujah as we go along

673
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,200
Folks, now that you
have heard my story

674
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:17,000
Say, boy, hand me over
another shot of that booze

675
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,600
If anyone should ask you
you just tell 'em

676
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:27,400
I've got those
St. James Infirmary blues

677
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to dedicate

678
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the next number
to the girl I love.

679
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,000
JP Morgan's got dollars,

680
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000

681

682
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,400
but I got a girl named Nettie

683
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,000
Fifty-second street
loves its reebop

684
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,200
Every butcher
loves a pork chop,

685
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,000
Every flower loves a dew drop,

686
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,800
But I love a girl named Nettie

687
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,600
A aeroplane needs a propeller

688
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,600
An ice man needs a pick,

689
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,800
A hot dog needs mustard

690
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,400
You bet I need my chick

691
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,000
Every wolf
has got a smooth line,

692
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,400
Every Frenchman
loves grape wine,

693
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,600
I'm not worried
'cause I've got mine,

694
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,000
I got a girl
named Nettie

695
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,000
Every jitterbug loves swing

696
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,800
A bookie loves a horse

697
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,000
Everybody loves something

698
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I love to be my gal's boss

699
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,600

Got my girl
and her name is Nettie

706
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,200
Folks,
the girl I'm gonna marry,

707
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,600
not next year, not next month,

708
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,400
not next week,
not tomorrow,

709
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,400
but right now.

710
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,800
Don't falter
at the altar,

711
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,000
when you take
that great big step

712
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,800
Don't falter
at the altar,

713
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,000
because you try and be hip

714
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,000
Lift your feet high

715
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,600
Ain't no time to sigh

716
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,200
It's your last free mile

717
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,600
So smile, brother, smile

718
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,000
Don't falter
at the altar,

719
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,200
'cause you have
no cross to bear

720
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,600
You father didn't falter,

721
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,400
son, that's why you're here

722
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,200
I can see
by the bookings in this paper,

723
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,400
sister, that you're not booked.

724
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,600
So, don't you
get any notions, sister.

725
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,400
Will you take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

726
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,600
I do, I do

727
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,000
A-to hold and to cherish
all the days of your life

728
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,000
I do, I do

729
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,400
Will you love this man
with all of your heart?

730
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,000
I will, I will

731
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,800
Through one-night stands
until death you do part?

732
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I will, I will

733
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,400
Does anybody here,
living or dead,

734
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,200
who thinks these two
should not be wed?

735
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,200
I see no reason
why a man this sane

736
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,800
should take on himself
a ball and chain.

737
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Overruled! Overruled!

738
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I hope you two
never have a strife

739
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,800
Now here it is

740
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,200
You are now man and wife

741
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,600
kiss the bride

742
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,000
Kiss the bride!

743
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,600
Man and wife!

744
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Hi de ho, man and wife.
