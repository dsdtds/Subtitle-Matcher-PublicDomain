- [Narrator] Those
who hunt by night

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,591
will tell you that the wildest

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,197
and most vicious of all
animals is the tiny shrew.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,797
The shrew feeds only by
the dark of the moon.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,151
He must eat his own body weight
every few hours, or starve.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,040
And the shrew
devours everything.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,349
Bones.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,271
Flesh.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,270
Marrow.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,236
Everything.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,033
In March, first in Alaska,

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,829
and then invading
steadily southward,

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,594
there were reports
of a new species.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,677
The giant killer shrew.

16
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,280
- Sure is a lot of
quiet out there.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,119
Almost smell it, can't you?

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,953
- No, I but I can feel it.

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,031
That pressure's dropped so fast,

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,599
it's almost made my ears pop.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,840
- Hurricanes got definite ways
of telling you it's there.

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,636
Where is it?

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,956
- Dead ahead.

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,472
- What's that mean to us?

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,200
- Now boy, that puts our port
right in the middle of it.

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,352
There's a cove on the
east side, though.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,317
We'll snuggle up close to
the bluff and ride it out.

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,198
- What about the bottom?

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,759
- Well, the chart shows
it's good holding ground.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,716
It's clay.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,634
You know something?

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,194
If this thing had
an automatic pilot,

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,953
I wouldn't have to
put up with you.

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,270
- Then you wouldn't
have nobody to chew out.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,872
- We should he there
in a couple of hours,

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,110
these mills of
yours keep running.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,477
- Look, automatic pilots
can't play dixieland jazz

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,039
on the mend, just like I can.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,555
- Hey, Rook!

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,516
Rook, come here.

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,316
Take a look.

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,192
There she is, dead ahead.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,078
- Man, that shore do look good.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,272
- Man named Craigis owns
this island, doesn't he?

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,000
- That's the name on the
crate. Dr. Marlowe Craigis.

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,798
- We'll unload tomorrow.

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,790
I don't want this crap
sitting high in that water,

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,678
when that blow hits.

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,512
- You gonna ride stern too,
with a lot of water under?

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,955
- That's right. That sea
won't make up in that cove.

51
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,634
That wind will have her
whippin' around like a kite.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,879
Step forward and break out
the heavy weather hook.

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,394
Check it and make
sure it's free to run.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,393
- I don't mind, Mr. Sherman.
- Good.

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,393
Aw, she'll ride like a duck.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,959
If she swings loo
far to starboard,

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,951
we might have to take
a check line to shore.

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,310
Hey, Rook.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,470
Take a slant up that trail.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,240
Now, that's a rather strange
setup. Wouldn't you say?

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,392
- Look like somebody's
getting rid of somebody.

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,754
Huh, Captain?

63
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,069
- Maybe.

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,036
Hard to tell.

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,630
- I'm Dr. Craigis.

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,713
- Thorns Sherman. I have
your supplies aboard.

67
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,473
- That's good.

68
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,312
Nothing wrong with
Captain Ferguson, I hope?

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,629
- Well, I wouldn't know.

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,393
I just bought his run.

71
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,039
- Oh, I see.

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,918
Were you able to fill our order?

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,674
- [Thorne] Everything on the
list. Here's the manifest.

74
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,592
- Missing last week's supply

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,035
has run us a little
short, you know.

76
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,317
Captain, after you have unloaded
I have a passenger for you.

77
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,276
Ann.

78
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,034
This is my daughter,
Ann Craigis.

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,111
- Well, it's gonna be
nice having you aboard.

80
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,953
I'm getting a little tired
of looking at Griswold.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,997
But we're, uh, we're
not leaving today.

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,394
In fact, we're not
even unloading.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,837
That load will cut
the roll in half.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,593
You expecting an invasion?

85
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,590
- Yes. Animals.

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,797
- Game, or otherwise?

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,434
- Under certain conditions,
it could be dangerous.

88
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,630
- [Thorne] Hey, Rook! You
wanna shake the kinks out?

89
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,797
Limber up a little?
- Not me, Captain.

90
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,837
You go right ahead
and stretch your legs.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,274
That ship's gonna be bucking

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,794
like a bucking
bronc, before long.

93
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,678
Besides, I got some
work left to do.

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,077
- If you do come
ashore, wear a gun.

95
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,673
- Got you, Captain.

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,472
- When I told you
about the hurricane,

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,557
you acted like you didn't
know anything about it.

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,870
What's the matter?
Your set broken down?

99
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,075
- We've been out
of communication

100
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,276
for more than a week, Captain.

101
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,794
- Can't it be fixed?

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,154
- It's totally
out of commission.

103
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,756
- My assistant.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,359
Mr. Farrell. Jerry Farrell.

105
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,709
- Father, perhaps the
captain would enjoy a drink.

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,792
- Well, of course. (chuckles)

107
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,638
Will you join us in a cocktail?

108
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,950
- Well, I've never been known
to turn down a drink yet.

109
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,553
I'd be glad to accept.

110
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,039
- Yeah. Fine.

111
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,111
In that case, we'll
have martinis.

112
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,349
Mario?

113
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,999
- Si, senor?

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,036
- Mix them, please.

115
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,597
Right this way,
Captain. Come in.

116
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,476
- You have everything
here you need?

117
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,836
- Oh, we are self
sufficient here.

118
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,879
We have cows for fresh milk
and chickens for fresh eggs.

119
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,917
- We even have Sermon horses.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,752
- Sort of a world
all to your own.

121
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,592
- That's exactly what
I've tried to create.

122
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,954
- Well, to each his own.

123
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,873
If you have to be
isolated for your work,

124
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,871
you've picked a
lonely little island.

125
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,277
- Excuse me, please.
I think I'll change.

126
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,151
- She's a little worried because

127
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,719
you aren't leaving
until tomorrow.

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,791
- Well, I can understand that.

129
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,712
Bu! there's something
else bothering her.

130
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,829
- Radford?

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,796
Radford.

132
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
Redford, would you
please step over here?

133
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,433
I'd like you to meet someone.

134
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,789
- Just a second, Doctor.

135
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,798
- That could go on for hours.

136
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,154
Dr. Baines!

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,632
- There's no need to shout,
Doctor. I'm right here.

138
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,075
- I'd like you to meet
Captain Thorne Sherman.

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,760
This is my other
assistant, Radford Baines.

140
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,319
- How do you do?

141
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,277
- Two new litters
since lunch, Doctor.

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,715
Both support GT116.

143
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,598
- [Marlowe] That's
good, but, uh-

144
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,274
- We can breed them to the 205
group in about three weeks.

145
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,000
But I'd prefer to wait and
expose about half of them

146
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,469
to the Hoskins factor, first.

147
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,436
If you agree.

148
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,436
- Good idea.

149
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,911
Do you know there's
a hurricane coming?

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,876
- Hurricane?

151
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,319
Well, I don't suppose there's
much we can do about that.

152
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,275
Glad to meet you.

153
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,794
Sherman, was it?

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,750
- You have to excuse Radford.

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,797
Anything that does not
concern his project

156
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,757
does not get through to him.

157
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,353
Brilliant mind.

158
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,919
He would starve to death,

159
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,792
if someone didn't
remind him to eat.

160
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,632
- Must be very interesting
work. What's his field?

161
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,439
- Biology. He specialized
in genetics, heredity.

162
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,672
- I'm afraid my interest doesn't
run in that line, you know.

163
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,599
- Think what would happen if
you could isolate and identify

164
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,393
the inherited
factor in each gene.

165
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,993
- Now, wait a minute.

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,673
I'm afraid I'm not very
good with pure research.

167
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,996
- This is practical research.

168
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,151
Generally among mammals,
the smaller the size,

169
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,312
the higher the metabolism
and shorter the life span.

170
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,874
- Is that right?

171
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,917
- Well, I'm attempting
to decrease the size

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,116
by maintaining a low metabolism,

173
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,436
and resultant, a
longer lifespan.

174
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,396
- What reason?

175
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,114
- Overpopulation.

176
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,839
Not a problem now, but
it will be, in time.

177
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,518
If we were half as
big as we are now,

178
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,319
we could live twice as long
on our natural resources.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,116
- Father, may I speak
with you a moment?

180
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,032
Will you please
excuse us, Captain?

181
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,272
- Well, providing you
drop the "Captain".

182
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,634
I prefer "Thorne".

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,876
- No.

184
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,996
Well...

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,996
Yeah.

186
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,872
- Tell me something, Doctor.

187
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,598
Has a hurricane ever
hit this island before

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,636
that you know of?

189
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,159
- I wouldn't know. (chuckles)

190
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,674
We've only been here nine months

191
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,398
and this place has been
unoccupied for years.

192
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,437
- Well, have you ever
been through one?

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,034
- Only the fringes.

194
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,758
- Well, this one's
building up very fast.

195
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,717
Pressure drops very
quickly in the center.

196
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,870
I'd advise you to get some doors

197
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,519
and windows open in this place.

198
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,357
- (chuckles)
Ventilators on the roof.

199
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
And if you'll freshen Ann's
drink, I'll go and check them.

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,750
- I'd be happy to.

201
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,480
- Thank heavens
you arrived today.

202
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,274
- Why? Are rations
getting short?

203
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,829
- No, it's more than
that. Much more.

204
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,639
We'll surely be able to
sail tomorrow, won't we?

205
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,596
- Possibly.

206
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,595
But not probable.

207
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,432
Not till late, anyway.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,034
Takes a long time for a sea
like that to quiet down.

209
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,111
- Well, if you're worrying
about me, you needn't.

210
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,315
I'm a good sailor.

211
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,198
- Oh, I'm not worried about you.

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,670
We'll sail when
the time's right.

213
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,234
- Got them opened, all right.

214
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,678
Well, Captain, let me
freshen you a drink.

215
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,669
One for the road.

216
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,636
Not trying to rush you, but
it will be dark soon.

217
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,791
- I've invited Thorne
for dinner, Father.

218
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,553
- Oh? (chuckles) I see.

219
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,197
If you're not worried about
your ship, you are welcome.

220
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,634
- I'll take a rain
check on that dinner.

221
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,154
- If you wish.

222
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,913
- Father, I've asked
Thorne to stay.

223
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,429
- Progress, Doctor!

224
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,511
This is the sole
survivor of group 30.

225
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,716
28 months old, today.

226
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,710
- Well, that's equivalent
to 140 years to us.

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,191
- That's right, yet it still
maintains low metabolism,

228
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,078
without any sluggishness.

229
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,794
- It's not the
breakthrough, but,

230
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,837
it certainly sets our course.

231
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,829
Radford.

232
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,355
Suspend series 52

233
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,592
through, uh, 96, and we'll
concentrate on the rest.

234
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,672
- What is that?
- It's a sorex soricidae.

235
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,553
- Looks like a small rat.

236
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,358
Smells like a skunk.

237
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,080
- (chuckles) They have
musk glands in their knees.

238
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,197
These little fellas
are our subjects.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,558
They have a birth
cycle of 10 to 14 days,

240
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,154
and using them, we
can establish traits.

241
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,310
We can trace the progressions,

242
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,754
through a number of generations,

243
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,911
over a short period of time.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,914
- Well how big do they get?
(ominous orchestral music)

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,910
- That's an adult.

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,992
See, the muzzle is long
and thicker than a rat's.

247
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,356
It extends over the
lower mandible, see?

248
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,316
- Does he bite?

249
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,799
- Only when he's hungry.

250
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,790
- [Thorne] Well, maybe
you'd better take him.

251
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,676
He doesn't know me.

252
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,396
- All he knows is his
next meal. (chuckles)

253
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,754
Ah.

254
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,513
He's just been fed.

255
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,477
He'll be all right for
another eight hours.

256
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,639
A shutter blew open!

257
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,710
Radford!

258
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,835
- I got it, senor.

259
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,038
- Don't let that scare
you. It's gonna get worse.

260
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,999
- Storms always frighten her,
ever since she was a child.

261
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,715
They are not climbers.

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,560
They are digging
animals, like the mole.

263
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,994
They feed only at night,
unless they are starving.

264
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,594
And when they are
hungry enough, they,

265
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,035
they'll tackle anything,
regardless of size.

266
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,599
- No kidding.
- Mm-hm.

267
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,557
If you leave two of them
in a cage for 12 hours,

268
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,110
without food, the
stronger will eat the weaker.

269
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,349
- Like cannibals.

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,874
- Precisely.

271
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,395
You see, their intense
activity requires

272
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,279
a tremendous amount of energy.

273
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,193
To supply, they must eat

274
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,191
three times their
own weight in food

275
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,511
every 24 hours, or starve.

276
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,830
Radford?

277
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,831
Would you please take this?

278
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,196
Take him.

279
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,239
Some call them bone eaters.

280
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,440
When the flesh is gone, they'll
eat the bones for marrow.

281
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,273
All they'll leave
are teeth, horns-

282
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,273
- I could use another
martini. Do you mind?

283
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,954
- Of course, my dear.
I'll get you one.

284
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,315
There you are.

285
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,273
Mario?

286
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,236
Mario!

287
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,193
Mario will show you to the
bath, you will freshen up a bit.

288
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,994
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hm.

289
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,833
- Have you got a problem, too?

290
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,675
Que paso?

291
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,077
But you will leave
on the ship tomorrow.

292
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,791
- Well, I think that all
depends on the wind and the sea.

293
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,756
Don't you?

294
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,274
- Si. Si, senor.

295
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,520
I no know.

296
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,474
Ah!

297
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,119
I feel the point.

298
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,076
I see.

299
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,271
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

300
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,795
Now, if anybody else is concerned
about my sailing tomorrow,

301
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,633
why, you see they feel
the point too, huh?

302
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,393
I don't like to repeat myself.

303
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,238
- [Mario] Okay, senor.

304
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,875
- I know, but I'm not saying
that you created them, Jerry!

305
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,713
I am saying that because
of your drunken stupidity

306
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,598
in leaving the cage door open,

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,036
you created the horrible
situation that now exists.

308
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,474
- Look, Ann, this is a mistake

309
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,233
any one of us might have made.

310
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,754
And I'm getting a little sick

311
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,877
of being called "An
irresponsible drunk."

312
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,874
Now, believe me I am.

313
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,390
Excuse me.

314
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,630
- Care for a cigarette?
- Thanks.

315
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,717
And thank heavens
you arrived today.

316
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,393
- You said that before.
What's the strain?

317
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,836
- [Ann] If I don't make
sense, please excuse me.

318
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,355
But it seems like everything
is coming to a head at once.

319
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,153
- [Thorne] Oh?

320
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,913
- I want to leave, but I
want my father to go with me.

321
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,434
- Well, then why doesn't he?

322
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,600
- We've discussed it many
times, but he's adamant.

323
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm sure Jerry has a lot
to do with his decision.

324
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,311
He tried to convince
me that the crisis

325
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,038
will only last for a few...

326
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,276
- Well.

327
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,671
This is certainly a
cozy little scene.

328
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,076
Might even be called
intimate. Boy meets girl-

329
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,312
- Stop it, Jerry. That
remark is uncalled for.

330
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,552
What I do or have to say
does not concern you.

331
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,551
- I can't disagree
with you more, my dear.

332
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,199
I'm concerned with
everything you do,

333
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,953
and I intend to
keep it that way.

334
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,793
Now, in my book, an engagement
isn't a casual thing.

335
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,553
- In my book, it isn't, either.

336
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,916
And last night ended ours.

337
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,749
- Help! Help!

338
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,079
Captain Thorne!

339
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,833
Somebody help!

340
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,716
Help!

341
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,598
Captain Thorne!

342
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,912
- Be reasonable!

343
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,150
Everybody in the world is
scared to death of something.

344
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,038
- That's evident.

345
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,599
When they came at us last
night, you knocked me down,

346
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,159
getting inside the fence.

347
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,714
- Oh, it's just that
I can't stand them.

348
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,269
- And I've discovered
something I can't stand.

349
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,674
- All right.

350
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,718
But I advise you not lo
mention it to anyone.

351
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,996
I'm gonna complete these
experiments with your father,

352
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,356
regardless of anything,
do you understand that?

353
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,478
Nobody is gonna take
this chance away from me.

354
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,559
- Where's Captain Sherman?

355
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,517
- Checking the
weather. I'll get him.

356
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,151
Captain?

357
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,116
Time for dinner.

358
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,119
- Somebody help!

359
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,190
Somebody!

360
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,515
Help, Captain!

361
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,351
Help!

362
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,714
Captain Thorne!

363
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,551
Somebody!

364
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,516
Help!

365
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,115
Help!

366
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,952
Help! Captain!

367
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,871
Captain!

368
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,753
- Well, a miss as good
as a mile, I always say.

369
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,478
- You know, if one of those
trees crashes through,

370
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,358
it might just knock the whole-

371
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,874
- Look, honey, any tree
on this side of the house

372
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,195
will fall away from
us, so just relax.

373
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,436
But I think I'd
better go back aboard.

374
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,431
Oh, don't think I'm not
grateful for your hospitality.

375
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,397
I am, but I'll see you tomorrow.

376
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,551
- Thorne. Your ship is safe.

377
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,273
Please, stay here with me.

378
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,950
- Why?

379
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,951
You scared or lonesome?

380
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,916
- Both.

381
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,473
- I'll take a rain check on it.

382
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,630
- Thorne!

383
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,233
You can't leave.

384
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,755
No one opens that
gate after dark.

385
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,639
- Well, who's
gonna stop me? You?

386
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,313
- With this.

387
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,152
No one opens that gate at night.

388
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,199
- Now, look, I
don't ask questions,

389
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,873
because it's against
my principles.

390
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,470
But wouldn't you
like to explain that?

391
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,756
- All right. Sit
down and I will.

392
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,836
- Give me the gun.

393
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,314
Not very becoming, anyway.

394
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,038
- Do you believe in fairy tales?

395
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,312
- Well, I'm a little old
for that sort of thing,

396
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,198
but uh, what'd you have in mind?

397
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,032
- Well, I'll tell you about one.

398
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,033
A true fairy tale, and you've
right in the middle of it.

399
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,439
- Oh?

400
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,874
- Have you ever
heard of a shrew?

401
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,156
- As in "Taming of the"-
- No, the animal.

402
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,676
Radford called them sorex
soricidae, when he showed you one.

403
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,592
- Oh, well, then shrew
must be the common name

404
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,431
for those cute little animals.

405
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,919
- "Cute"?

406
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,354
That's the last word
you can use to describe

407
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,351
those little monsters.

408
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,432
They're the most horrible
animals on the face of the earth.

409
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,919
As father told you,

410
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,434
they breed within three
weeks after birth.

411
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,033
Their lifespan is
around one year.

412
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,952
- Yeah, I know what
your father told me,

413
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,678
but what's that got to do
with me opening that gate?

414
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,434
- There are 200 or 300
giant shrews out there.

415
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,433
Monsters, weighing
between 50 and 100 pounds.

416
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,035
- 50 to 100...

417
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,153
Wait a minute. You
must be kidding.

418
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,913
- I'm definitely not kidding.

419
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,717
- That's as big as
a full-grown wolf.

420
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,952
- And what's more, they
are beginning to starve.

421
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,759
- No wonder you didn't
want me to go out there.

422
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,717
Thanks for saving my skin.

423
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,519
- And I'm sorry I had to
threaten you with a gun,

424
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,273
but I didn't know
how else to stop you.

425
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,271
- Oh, it was very effective.

426
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,556
Bu! all you had to do
was tell me about them.

427
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,838
- Well, I hoped I
wouldn't have to.

428
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,797
But you changed everything,
when you started to leave.

429
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,678
And I had to stop you, some way.

430
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,757
- You say there's
200 or 300 out there?

431
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,796
- Ann.

432
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,992
That's right, Captain Thorne.

433
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,515
And if you'd stuck with your
row boat and played captain,

434
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,511
instead of trying to play
detective, you wouldn't have

435
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,637
to worry about how many
are out there, would you?

436
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,438
- [Marlowe] That's
enough, Jerry!

437
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,473
What's wrong, Ann?

438
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,312
- Thorne decided to leave.

439
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,313
To dissuade him, I started
to tell him about the shrews.

440
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,840
- He might as well know the
whole story as half of it.

441
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,915
I guess we're all a
little jumpy, Captain.

442
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,229
- Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

443
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,440
Six months ago, we
managed to isolate

444
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,034
the path to controlling size.

445
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,599
Two litters were born.

446
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,557
Six individuals,
we kept for study.

447
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,515
They were about the size
of buckshot, at birth.

448
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,712
But the rate of
growth was abnormal.

449
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,037
They continued to grow and grow.

450
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,230
They were mutants.

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,230
But they inherited all the
negative characteristics

452
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,879
of their breed.

453
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,395
Somehow, they managed to escape.

454
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,319
About a month later, we
saw one of the offsprings.

455
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,915
They were multiplying.

456
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,637
We did everything in the
world to exterminate them,

457
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,394
but no apparent luck.

458
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,629
Then we haven't seen any,
since daylight blinds them

459
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,111
and they forage only at
night, unless starving.

460
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,114
But the fact that two of
them charged Ann and Jerry

461
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,554
at the gate last evening

462
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,278
indicates that their
available food on the island

463
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,680
is nearing depletion.

464
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,032
- Then what, Doctor?

465
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,589
- They will
exterminate each other.

466
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,159
It'll take a couple days.

467
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,800
- And what do we do
during that time?

468
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,951
- Stay indoors and
wait until it's over.

469
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,673
- [Thorne] I guess some wires
blew down on the transformer.

470
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,229
- [Ann] I'm sorry.
I'll gel some lamps.

471
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,599
' [Jerry] Mario! Mario!

472
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,239
- [Mario] Si, senor?

473
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,390
- There's a lantern
in the pantry.

474
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,550
Light it and bring it in here.

475
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,510
Radford, light all the
candles you can find.

476
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,432
- All right, I will.
- Where's the generator?

477
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,797
- Outside. Can't
get at it at night.

478
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,718
- [Jerry] Here. Let me help.

479
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,519
- A lantern will give you
all the light you need.

480
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,233
I will join you shortly, Jerry.

481
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,549
- Well, Jerry, I
felt she was sincere

482
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,519
and made sense,
from her standpoint.

483
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,634
- Wanting her father to
leave the island with her

484
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,233
makes sense?

485
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,231
It'd be much
better for the project

486
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,550
if I went with her
for a few days.

487
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,916
As a matter of fact, I think
I'll talk to Doctor about that.

488
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,274
That might be the answer.

489
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,514
And another thing, I don't take
much to this Thorne Sherman.

490
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,114
He looks to me like the
type that'd try anything.

491
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,397
- That left-handed
dinner invitation.

492
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,949
That was just to keep me here
till after dark, wasn't it?

493
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,913
- I wanted you here tonight.

494
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,753
I thought something terrible
was going to happen.

495
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,558
- Well, do you still feel
the same way about it?

496
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,076
- Not as much. Not since you're
here and know everything.

497
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,278
I love an open fire. Don't you?

498
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,236
- Mm-hm.

499
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,271
- The wind has a lonesome sound.

500
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,236
Doesn't it?

501
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,272
- [Thorne] Sure does.

502
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,960
- Back in Sweden, we don't
have a wind this strong.

503
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,670
You're a strange man, Thorne.

504
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,433
I never met anyone like you.

505
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,199
- Oh?

506
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,271
- You seem so disinterested
in everything.

507
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,153
Aren't you the
least bit curious?

508
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,991
Don't you wonder about the
unusual things around here?

509
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,829
The guns, the fence,

510
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,831
the shattered windows,

511
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,752
my accent, anything?

512
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,831
- I'll tell you something.

513
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,797
I'm only interested in
anything that concerns me,

514
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,996
and then I do
something about it.

515
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,954
You're gonna sail
with me tomorrow,

516
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,793
whether your father
intends to or not.

517
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,158
- [Ann] Thorne, no!

518
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,275
Father! Rad!

519
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,276
Out there!

520
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,273
- I don't think he
was going out, Jerry.

521
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,271
- I couldn't take a chance!
He's fool enough to!

522
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,873
- Don't be stupid.

523
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,792
I had no intentions
of going out there,

524
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,679
opening that gate, unless
somebody needed it.

525
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,592
Did you hear it, Doctor?

526
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,115
Sounded like a human voice.
I was thinking of Rook.

527
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,716
- It was the livestock. The
shrews got into the barn!

528
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,999
- What was it, Father?

529
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,758
- I! was the livestock.

530
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,873
- [Jerry] Did Mario
forget to bar those doors?

531
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,513
- No.

532
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,238
I put them in the barn myself.

533
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,876
They couldn't get
through the wood doors.

534
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,752
They dug through the dirt floor.

535
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,070
- Let me ask you
something, Doctor.

536
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,436
How could you expose all our
lives, yourself included,

537
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,557
with those things out there?

538
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,233
All you had to do was get
the coast guard or the navy

539
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,675
to come in here
and burn 'em out.

540
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,512
If those things got loose-

541
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,956
- Any unusual experiment
can produce unusual results.

542
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,316
That's why I chose this island.

543
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,356
It's isolated.

544
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,194
Miles of open water,
in any direction.

545
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,749
Our project is
privately financed.

546
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,034
It's not a product for the
government, or military.

547
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,679
And the world is in no danger.

548
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,633
This species does
not swim,

549
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,633
And as far as the
shrews are concerned,

550
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,990
this island is their world.

551
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,190
- Very soon, right here on this
island, there's going to be

552
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,160
a miniature reproduction
of an overpopulated world,

553
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,753
and you'll see the importance

554
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,831
of what we're working to avoid!

555
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,036
- I'm not concerned
about all this theory.

556
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,997
What I'm concerned
about is our lives!

557
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,435
- There'll be ample time to
panic when they run out of food

558
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,114
and go on a 24-hour forage.

559
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,350
- How do you know
they haven't already?

560
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,272
- That's possible.

561
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,829
Their main diet has been the
small animals on the island.

562
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,157
That source could have been
depleted, 18 or 20 hours ago.

563
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,719
And that's why they went
after the livestock.

564
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,558
- There's still some
food on this island,

565
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,438
before they reach the crisis.

566
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,396
- Where?

567
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,399
No worry about them
digging in here.

568
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,954
The floors are tile.

569
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,919
- But the walls aren't,
Doctor. They're adobe.

570
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,877
Our safest bet would
be on that boat.

571
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,155
- You may be right.

572
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,119
You can reach your
boat in daylight.

573
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,471
The shrews will gorge
themselves on livestock.

574
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,798
That should keep them
lethargic for several hours.

575
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,759
- There's no sense
looking at the dark side.

576
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,037
- And there's no sense
minimizing a serious situation.

577
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,714
It leaves you completely
unprepared to cope with it.

578
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,112
Now, we certainly
can't make it tonight.

579
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,396
That's out of the
question. Maybe tomorrow.

580
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,958
I have it.

581
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,713
We'll get some sleep tonight,
but we'll have a watch.

582
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,199
An hour and a half, apiece.

583
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,032
Doctor, you go first,
and then Radford,

584
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,919
Mario, Jerry, and then me.

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,434
Shutter all the windows.

586
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,794
Make sure they're
locked good and tight.

587
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,200
Check all these walls.

588
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,958
- Come, darling.

589
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,680
- No, I think I'll stay here
by the fire. I feel safer.

590
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,831
I couldn't stand it
in that room alone.

591
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,678
- All right. As you wish.

592
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,637
But try to get some sleep.

593
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,715
- I will.

594
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,475
- [Mario] Senor
Farrell, it is Mario.

595
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,631
You are next to
make the patrol, no?

596
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,109
- Uh, sure, Mario. Come on in!

597
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,078
I've been, been waiting
for you to finish.

598
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,879
I must have dozed off.
You kinda startled me.

599
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,599
Sit down!

600
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,074
Here.

601
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,833
Have a drink. It'll
help you to relax.

602
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,796
- Gracias, senor.

603
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,311
- Sit down!

604
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,435
Rest a while.

605
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,519
You just checked every room
in the house, didn't ya?

606
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,795
- Si.

607
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,711
- Fine.

608
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,798
You're a good man, Mario.

609
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,077
A man that can be trusted.

610
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,594
You know what I've been
thinking about, Mario?

611
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,480
Ann,

612
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,039
and that captain.

613
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,194
You and me.

614
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,233
Imagine an intelligent
girl like her, going for a

615
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,153
COMMON

616
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,356
sea tramp, like him.

617
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,798
I know
why! You do, too.

618
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,313
In case anything goes wrong,

619
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,311
she's looking out
for her own hide.

620
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,475
That's why I keep
thinking about you and me.

621
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,198
Anything goes wrong,

622
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,035
we're gonna outlast them all.

623
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,150
I'm going to trust you

624
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,029
to take my turn at
patrolling the house.

625
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,397
Bu! when you finish,

626
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,397
don't wake the captain.

627
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,358
Come back here and get me.

628
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,472
See, I'll probably feel
good enough by then

629
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,834
to take his turn.

630
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,959
Okay, Mario?

631
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,075
- Si.
- Okay.

632
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,999
- Senor, it is Mario.

633
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,718
- [Thorne] Oh,
Mario. Come on in.

634
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,031
What is it?

635
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,878
- A shrew in the cellar?
- Si!

636
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,190
I hear him singing down there.

637
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,237
- Well, how did he get in?

638
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,550
- The storm breakout the
kitchen window but I close it off.

639
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,278
He went down there.

640
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,873
- Why should he go down there?

641
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,598
- The food for the
(speaks Spanish).

642
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,398
(speaks Spanish) They love it.

643
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,359
- Well, did you tell Jerry?
- No, senor.

644
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,000
He get your turn next.
Here is on the loose.

645
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,036
We kill him, no?

646
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,910
- Yeah.

647
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,074
Ann.

648
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,429
Ann, wake up.

649
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,510
A shrew got in.

650
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,556
It's all right!

651
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,438
He's down in the cellar.

652
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,511
Now, we're going down after
him, bull don't want you

653
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,671
to let anybody open that
door, till I tell you to.

654
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,955
You understand?

655
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,956
Good girl.

656
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,996
Okay.

657
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,229
Open it just a crack.

658
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,151
Open it.

659
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,635
Hold on to it!

660
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,636
Okay.

661
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,758
You take that side.

662
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,354
Mario?

663
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,235
- [Thorne] You see anything?

664
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,469
- I see where he was.

665
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,318
I do not see where he is.

666
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,152
(Thorne speaks Spanish)
- Si, senor.

667
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,230
I will be careful.

668
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,837
- Here, let me fix that.

669
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,073
- You all right down there?

670
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,753
- Doctor! Get down here, quick!

671
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,110
Mario, Mario.

672
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,076
- Mario?

673
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,511
He...

674
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,511
He's dead.

675
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,796
- Dead?

676
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,475
I got this on him right away!

677
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,959
He couldn't have bled to death.

678
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,839
- Might as well let go of it.

679
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,200
Won't do him any good now.

680
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,519
- What could've killed him?

681
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,516
- I'm not certain.

682
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,755
Till the autopsy.

683
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,794
- Hemotoxic syndrome.

684
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,396
- I'm afraid so.

685
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,794
We'll know, after pathology.

686
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,353
- Doctor, that's not the
same animal you showed me.

687
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,555
That's a monster.

688
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,595
- As I said...

689
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,710
They are mutants.

690
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,110
In controlling the size factor,

691
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,999
we seem to have crossed some
of the other characteristics.

692
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,230
- Well, you certainly
did a good job of it!

693
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,557
- I've known that for
some time, Captain!

694
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,716
Would you please give
me a hand with Mario?

695
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,519
Radford, bring up the animal.

696
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,791
- Extremely high poison
content in the shrew's saliva.

697
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,314
- Mm-hm.

698
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,033
Now, compare it with this.

699
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,957
Careful count isn't necessary.

700
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,512
Any indication it's the
same poison in Mario's blood

701
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,398
will give you the answer.

702
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,515
- Yes, you're right.

703
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,316
- Look, Ann.

704
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,870
Brooding about it's
not gonna do any good.

705
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,517
Now, why don't you try to
think of something else?

706
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,114
Tell me, what do
you do around here?

707
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,395
Are you a scientist?

708
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,232
- I'm a zoologist.

709
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,880
- Oh? That's the study
of animal life, isn't it?

710
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,950
Well, do you specialize?
What do you specialize in?

711
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,155
- Their diet.

712
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,551
Oh, I had a hand in this, too.

713
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,994
And I'm partly to blame.

714
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,190
If we ever get off this island,

715
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,556
I'll never have anything
to do with it again.

716
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,350
- What will you do?

717
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,638
- Live normally,
like normal women do.

718
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,749
May seem a little dull, after
the life I've been living,

719
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,519
but rather dull and
alive, than excited and-

720
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,750
- I'll take a dull,
alive woman, every time.

721
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,389
- Say, Thorne.

722
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,439
The autopsy has proved
what we suspected.

723
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,354
Several weeks ago,

724
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,034
I concocted the most
virulent poison I could

725
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,111
with the materials
I had at hand.

726
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,600
And we put it out as bait.

727
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,158
Mario was killed by poison.

728
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,152
- Doctor, I wonder if you
thought the system of the sorex

729
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,629
enabled them to
assimilate that poison.

730
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,394
It remained in the salivary
glands of their jaws.

731
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,834
Isn't that wonderful?

732
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,918
Well, I am sorry.

733
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,152
Of course, I always speak from
the clinical point of view.

734
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,232
- Well, don't you have something
to counteract that poison?

735
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,638
- Once Mario was bitten,

736
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,950
I'm afraid there's nothing
anyone could have done.

737
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,350
This indicates that we
cannot afford to get

738
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,831
even so much as a scratch
from these animals.

739
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,997
They're more
poisonous than snakes.

740
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,912
- What, do you think
they're all affected?

741
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,357
- Best way to find out
is let 'em all bite ya,

742
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,556
and see which bite
you die after.

743
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,190
- We might just all get that
chance, Jerry. You included.

744
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,195
Doctor, I've closed all
the doors in the house.

745
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,671
I suggest we do the same thing
with this hall and this lab.

746
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,194
It'll cut down the chances

747
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,998
of getting in the
front of the house.

748
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,832
I think if we keep a
close watch on those walls

749
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,719
and windows in there, we
might make it till daybreak.

750
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,950
- [Marlowe] Hm. The
walls are two-feet thick.

751
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,271
Do you think they have
a chance to dig in?

752
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,271
- Of course there's a chance!

753
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,112
Anywhere that Master's off,

754
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,237
that adobe's as soft as
mush where that rain hit it.

755
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,393
It's not a bad idea, Doctor.

756
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,437
But here's another
possibility, Doctor.

757
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,038
It's very light out. It's
going to be daylight soon.

758
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,477
We'll take the shrew
that killed Mario

759
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,359
and throw it over the
fence and use it for bait.

760
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,919
If they show up for it,

761
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,957
of course, the run
for the boat's out.

762
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,519
But if they don't,
then I'll go down

763
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,398
and have Rook lay
to with a lighter.

764
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,312
Then I'll return to
the bend in the trail

765
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,152
and give you the
all-clear signal.

766
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,400
- Sounds fine, Captain.

767
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,595
- Good, then you
explain it to the rest.

768
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,590
- Yes, I will.

769
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,157
- Well, the bait's been
out for 20 minutes.

770
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,560
Nothing's touched it.

771
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,434
- Even the wind has gone
down. Isn't that wonderful?

772
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,876
- I'm afraid it's not over,
my dear. It's just a lull.

773
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,712
There'll be a lot more.

774
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,076
- He's right. I'll be
back a! the bend, shortly.

775
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,798
Now, you watch
for my signal, hm?

776
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,991
- You can't go alone!
- I'll go with him.

777
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,720
- Not you, Father. You
haven't even fired a gun!

778
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,035
Take Rad or Jerry.

779
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,189
- Sure, I'll go.

780
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,270
Then you'll be sure
of getting a signal.

781
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,473
- Don't shoot that gun,
unless you have to.

782
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,479
We've only got 20
rounds all together.

783
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,238
- I know that as well as you do.

784
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,196
Sherman.

785
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,520
You stay away from her.

786
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,076
- Do you have that
gun pointed at me?

787
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,039
- Right at the
middle of your back.

788
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,437
- Look, we got enough problems
without worrying about Ann.

789
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,919
- I'm telling you,
stay away from her

790
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,474
or when the shrews
get through with you,

791
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,551
they won't even
find the buckshot.

792
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,955
- Hey, Rook!

793
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,556
Hey, Rook!

794
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,316
Rook!

795
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,475
- Where's the skiff?

796
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,432
- I'll follow that check
line. I've gotta find him.

797
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,034
- Since last night, you
won't find much of him.

798
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,272
- Would you shut up?
- I'm not going back!

799
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,431
- You what?
- I'm staying here.

800
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,999
- All right. You suit yourself.

801
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,912
But if I were you, I'd
swim out to that boat.

802
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,230
- Can't swim!

803
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,873
- Then stay here.

804
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,429
- Wait a minute! You
gotta give me a gun!

805
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,639
- Give you a gun?

806
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,235
- Sherman, wait!

807
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,638
- This is the gun
we had on the boat.

808
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,759
They don't leave much, do they?

809
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,110
- Sherman, we've gotta
make a deal for...

810
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,831
What is it?
- Shh!

811
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,550
They've been trailing
us on both sides.

812
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,958
- Where? I didn't see anything.

813
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,192
Look, Sherman, you
gotta give me a gun.

814
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,749
- All right.

815
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,638
Whatever you do, don't you run.

816
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,075
And you stay in front of me,
'cause I don't trust you.

817
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,674
- They're coming!

818
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,720
Open the gate!

819
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,870
Open it!

820
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,559
Open the gate!

821
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,835
Open the gate!

822
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,998
-[Thorne] open up!

823
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,675
- [Marlowe] You've got to
let him in! Let him in!

824
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,751
- Jerry, open the door!

825
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,193
- [Marlowe] Jerry, you
have to let him in!

826
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,078
Sherman!

827
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,230
- The shrews were out there!
I couldn't take a chance!

828
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,836
- For heaven's sakes,
Doctor! Stop him!

829
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,274
- All right. Didn't he have
it coming or didn't he?

830
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,239
- What happened out there?

831
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,072
- Oh, nothing much.

832
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,470
Jerry just tried to kill me
twice, in the last five minutes.

833
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,239
Rook came ashore last night.

834
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,270
He's dead.

835
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,193
This is all that was left.

836
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,237
Won't do us any good.
It's got no ammo.

837
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,199
- I'm deeply sorry, Captain.

838
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,912
I wish he had
followed your orders.

839
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,118
- Look, Doctor. You
casually mentioned animals.

840
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,953
You didn't explain to us what
we were facing out there!

841
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,237
- You have every right
to feel the way you do.

842
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,594
My mistake was only mine.
It was one of judgment.

843
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,877
I didn't know about
the hurricane.

844
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,430
I didn't anticipate the effect
it would have on the shrews.

845
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,276
I thought the house would
be safe through the crisis.

846
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,839
- How could you expose
your own daughter?

847
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,991
How could you
expose Ann to that?

848
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,152
- She was going to leave last
week but the boat didn't come.

849
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,390
- I need a drink.

850
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,192
Anybody else care for one?

851
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,998
- I could use some coffee.

852
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,195
- I'll make some.

853
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,112
- Thank you, my dear.

854
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,838
- Cream and sugar?

855
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,910
- [Radford] Oh, my leg!

856
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,069
- [Jerry] Slam the door!

857
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,398
- You all right, Doctor?

858
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,198
- He just ripped my
trousers, that's all.

859
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:25,152
- Are you sure that's all?

860
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,112
- I'm completely
aware of it, Doctor.

861
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,997
- I'll kill them!
(gun fires)

862
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,952
- That was a stupid
waste of ammunition.

863
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,111
Every one of 'em, a clean miss.

864
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,998
There's still four
of 'em in there.

865
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,472
- [Marlowe] How did they get in?

866
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,029
- Through that kitchen window.
That rope must be rotten.

867
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,594
- (gasps) It got him!

868
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,756
Radford!

869
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,910
He...

870
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,916
He's dead.

871
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,519
-[Ann] Oh, no!

872
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,234
- He recorded every
symptom and reaction,

873
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,233
right up to the
moment of his death.

874
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,075
- Jerry, tear down one of
those drapes and cover him up.

875
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,470
- Sure!

876
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,039
Sure!

877
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,829
Craigis'll cover Ann
and I'll cover him.

878
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,275
You'll cover me, but
who'll cover you?

879
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,033
- Shut up!

880
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,430
- We can get on mantle,
sway from the chan-

881
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,034
- I told you to shut up!

882
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,757
Now, you stop
sniveling and think!

883
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,232
- [Jerry] It'd take a
tank to get us outta here!

884
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,836
- Thorne!

885
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,831
There!

886
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,632
- [Thorne] Give me
a hand with this.

887
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,598
- It won't take them
long to dig around this.

888
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,071
- You're right. No telling
where else they're digging, too.

889
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,429
- [Jerry] There!

890
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,198
- Come on!
- Oh, no!

891
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,358
There's not enough stuff here
to barricade those walls.

892
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,158
I'll tell you we'll pile some
of those crates up over there.

893
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,358
That roof's our last chance.
Here, help me, Doctor.

894
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,794
Ann, see if you can
find something light!

895
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,712
- (groans) All right.

896
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,194
- Here, help her
with that, Doctor.

897
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,793
Jerry, see if you
can find some rope.

898
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,797
Yes. Use these chemical
drums as tanks!

899
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,234
Individual tanks!

900
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,833
Here, I'll show you.
- All right.

901
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,389
- Se! it down here.
- Yeah.

902
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,879
- Let it down now.
- All right.

903
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,758
- Slow.
- All right.

904
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,319
All right?
- Yeah.

905
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,680
I've got you. It'll work!

906
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,273
It'll work!

907
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,034
- But these drums are
too tall for the base!

908
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,077
If the shrews don't push
us over, the wind will!

909
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,800
- Not if we lash 'em together!
- Huh? All right.

910
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,440
- Hey, are there any
more around here?

911
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,597
- Only that one over there!

912
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,478
- Have any coal chisels
or hammers or anything

913
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,437
I could knock a hole in
here and make air pieces?

914
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:33,390
- [Marlowe] There are some
tools over there in the corner!

915
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,315
- Hey, here's another one!

916
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,789
Hey, get that out there
and we'll work on it.

917
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,156
Hey, this is even better!

918
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,633
Give me a little more slack.

919
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,037
Get some rope and
put it on that latch,

920
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,918
so we can reach it
from the ground.

921
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,909
Jerry!

922
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,591
- [Jerry] Somebody
hold the other end!

923
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,674
- Now, hold this end.
- All right.

924
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,553
- All right. We're all set!

925
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,233
Look, it's gonna be rough,

926
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,879
bu! we should be able to
duck walk to the beach.

927
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,712
Where's Jerry?

928
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,790
- [Jerry] There's a lot of
'em out there! I can see 'em!

929
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,439
I'm not going!

930
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,954
- [Thorne] Look, come down here!

931
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,110
That wind will blow you
right off that roof!

932
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,350
- I told you, I'm not going!

933
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,551
I'm staying here!

934
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,119
- We've got to get him
down here, somehow.

935
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,396
Ann, see if you can
coax him down here.

936
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,154
- Jerry! Jerry, please
come down with us!

937
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,918
- No, Ann! They'll get
you if you go out there!

938
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,832
- Come down here, you fool!

939
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,434
Poor devil. I hope he makes it.

940
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,956
- We can't leave him! He's
not responsible for himself.

941
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,400
- We've got to go now.

942
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,240
All right, Doctor.
- All right.

943
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,550
All right!

944
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,719
- Now, hold it up!

945
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,310
Put it down slow.
- All right!

946
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,754
- Everybody ready?

947
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,114
I'm gonna open that gate!

948
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,117
- [Marlowe] We're ready!

949
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,150
- Ready.

950
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,560
- Okay, here they come!

951
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,395
Hold on! Hold on!

952
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,799
- Ann, what's the matter?

953
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,950
Your side's dragging.

954
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,199
You wanna rest? You tired?

955
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,916
- What'd you say?

956
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,553
- She says she's all right.

957
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,029
She's keeping her eyes closed.

958
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,760
- All right. Keep
your eyes closed.

959
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,513
They can'! get at
you through the slit.

960
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,080
- This empty drum is
too heavy for her.

961
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,878
I can barely hold up my side.

962
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,033
- I'll be all right in a minute.

963
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,674
- All right.

964
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,955
You walk.

965
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,229
I'll drag for a while.

966
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,989
Listen. Don't let
their head get under.

967
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,753
They'll flip us over!

968
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,319
- He got my foot!

969
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,310
- Check your foot!

970
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,874
- No, my foot is free,
but he got my boot.

971
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,075
- Is there a scratch?

972
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,429
- No. Not a mark.

973
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,479
- Keep moving!

974
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,275
Let's go! Let's go!

975
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,669
- Thorne, I don't think I...

976
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,756
- What?

977
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,879
- Sand! (gasps)

978
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,075
We have sand!

979
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,757
Thorne, we're close!

980
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,592
- We'll hi! the water soon.

981
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,354
It doesn't sound like
they're following us anymore.

982
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,200
- We'd better walk deeper.

983
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,112
- I'm about drowned out.

984
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,111
- Okay, let's swim for it.

985
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,076
- Okay.

986
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,755
We are safe, aren't
we? I mean, the storm.

987
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,194
- Oh, sure.

988
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,634
She rode out the
first half all right,

989
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,950
and that's always the roughest.

990
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,156
Anyway, riding an anchor
out will give me a chance

991
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,198
to learn a little bit more
about that Swedish accent.

992
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,279
- In 24 hours, there'll be
one shrew left on the island,

993
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,953
and he'll be dead of starvation.

994
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,437
An excellent example
of overpopulation.

995
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,830
- Well, you know
something, Doctor?

996
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,796
- What's that?

997
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,552
- I'm not gonna worry about
overpopulation, just yet.

998
