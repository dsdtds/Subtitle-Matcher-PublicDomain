00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:40,465
Where the blazing desert meets the blue Mediterranean and modern Europe jostles ancient Africa

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,230
.

.

19
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,489
I'm not interested in hearing excuses about local conditions.

20
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,153
No doubt there are local conditions.

21
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:34,400
Here's a criminal whose exploits have made him notorious throughout Europe.

22
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,030
He escaped from France

23
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,090
with a fortune in jewels. And for two years, he's been living here in Algiers,

24
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,904
within a stone's throw of your headquarters.

25
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:44,638
As you say commissioner.
I'm here to settle this.

26
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:45,936
I want it done quickly.

27
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,875
We've been trying to settle the case of Pepe le Moko for two years.

28
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,825
In Paris, we handle more difficult cases every day.

29
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:54,301
Too bad you couldn't arrest him before he escaped from France.

30
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,830
Merely an oversight, no doubt.

31
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,891
Do you deal in riddles here?
Indeed we do.

32
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:00,552
Oriental riddles.

33
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:04,227
From my experience, there's no problem in surrounding a given area.

34
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,641
You close in, and you make a house-to-house investigation.

35
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,257
A house-to-house investigation?

36
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:14,370
You just arrived from Paris, commissioner.

37
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,126
You're not familiar with the Casbah.
Casbah? What's that?

38
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,702
Some kind of nut?
A very hard nut to crack.

39
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:22,052
You see. Pepe le Moko lives in the Casbah.

40
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:25,209
Why not go in and take him out of it?
You can't arrest a king in his own palace.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,359
Pepe is well guarded.

42
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,513
Let me show you.

43
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,816
Fantastic.

44
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:30,501
As a civilized man, you don't like fantasy.

45
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:33,747
As a police officer, I don't believe in it.
But here it is.

46
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,741
The native quarter known as the Casbah.

47
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:39,381
As you look at it here, it's just a few lines on the map.

48
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:43,776
But the reality is something stranger than anything you could have dreamed.

49
00:03:43,776 --> 00:03:46,559
It's only a step from the modern city, the Casbah.

50
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:49,503
But when you take that step, you enter another world.

51
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:52,251
A melting pot for all the sins of the earth.

52
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,598
Seen from a bird's eye view, the Casbah is a great staircase.

53
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:59,625
Each step is a terrace rising from the sea.

54
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:01,842
If you observe more closely,

55
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,960
you'll see that those terraces and courtyards and twisted streets

56
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:07,428
are like a crawling anthill,

57
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:08,748
a jungle of houses,

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,365
a labyrinth of narrow passages and winding alleys

59
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:13,761
rotten with vermin

60
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:16,656
and decay from the filth of centuries.

61
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,391
No one knows what mysteries are hidden behind those walls.

62
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,816
No one knows what crimes and hopes

63
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:24,886
are buried in those secret courtyards.

64
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,993
Forty thousand inhabitants from all over the world.

65
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:30,344
Some have been settled here for generations.

66
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,101
There are Kabulis in their white robes,

67
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,216
Chinese faithful to Confucius,

68
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,720
Gypsies with their fortune telling and their songs,

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,415
and there are many Czechos,

70
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,290
and there are Slavs far from home,

71
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,839
and Maltese,

72
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,411
Negroes from every corner of Africa,

73
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:49,102
Sicilians and Spaniards, hot-blooded and quick to hate,

74
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:50,767
and women,

75
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,436
women of every age and every shape,

76
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,946
women caught in the neck of the Casbah.

77
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:58,423
And everywhere there are terraces,

78
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:01,400
all connected together so that those who are accepted

79
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:05,007
can move to any part of the Casbah without using the street.

80
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,366
The terraces are the domain of the native women

81
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:10,971
and it would be dire for a foreigner to go there unless he was known and protected.

82
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:15,089
The Casbah rises like a fortress from the sea,

83
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:18,160
colorful, sordid, dangerous.

84
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,720
There isn't just one Casbah.

85
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,996
There are hundreds,

86
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,454
a thousand.

87
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,116
And in that labyrinth,

88
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,573
Pepe le Moko is at home,

89
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:29,904
and he's safe as long as he stays there.

90
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:32,881
You mean to say that you don't go into this quarter?

91
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,806
It's easy to go in.

92
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:37,892
Sometimes, it's no so easy to come out.

93
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:39,899
You cross the dead line.

94
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,126
Suddenly,

95
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:43,015
a bullet hits you feet.

96
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,799
It's just a friendly suggestion.

97
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,194
Don't take the next step.

98
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:51,044
From a roof up above,

99
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:53,061
a voice speaks.

100
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,782
Hello, inspector.

101
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:56,756
How did he know you were there?

102
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,504
Don't ask us.

103
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:01,177
Ask Inspector Slimane.

104
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:03,769
The Casbah is his territory.

105
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:06,131
How does Pepe le Moko conceal himself?

106
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,268
Disguise, no doubt.

107
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,900
You don't know Pepe.

108
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,792
He'd laugh at a disguise.

109
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,890
Then why don't you find him?

110
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,948
Oh, but that is singularly easy.

111
00:06:15,994 --> 00:06:17,506
I see him every day.

112
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:18,280
What?

113
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:21,091
Our distinguished colleague is disturbed.

114
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:25,251
The man is wanted in all the capitals of Europe, and you see him every day.

115
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,411
Another example of what you call the local condition.

116
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:31,083
Gross inefficiency. No effort to make an arrest.

117
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:34,641
To arrest him in the Casbah, distinguished colleague, would be simple.

118
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:36,779
To get him out would be impossible.

119
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,361
So, you do nothing.

120
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:41,859
I flatter myself that I do a great deal in my humble way.

121
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:46,031
I learn about Pepe. I know his habits. I study his weaknesses.

122
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,908
When one can't use guns, one must work with brains.

123
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,518
I prefer guns.

124
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:55,389
In your case, honored sir, such a preference is unavoidable.

125
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:59,979
By his looks, I'd say he was too lazy to make an arrest.
I'm merely careful.

126
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,846
Which means to say you're looking after your own skin.

127
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,760
It's the only skin I have.

128
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,113
So Pepe le Moko wouldn't amuse me.

129
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:08,282
We'll find out.

130
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:11,659
I want twelve men tonight, inspected and ready for work.

131
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,935
And you might prepare a special cell for Pepe le Moko.

132
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,872
You and I have the same feeling, Pepe, for beauty.

133
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,635
This pearl belongs on a very special kind of ear,

134
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,562
like a pink shell

135
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:27,416
with a little curl of gold hair,

136
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,419
a special kind of gold.

137
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,407
I can see it.

138
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:37,031
No.

139
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:39,695
Pearls don't suit you at all, Carlos.

140
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:40,834
You're not the type.

141
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,621
He'd look better with rings in his ears.

142
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,916
Yes, and one in his nose.

143
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,692
He is definitely uncouth.

144
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,573
You took the words out of my mouth.

145
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,380
He's trying to cheat us, Pepe.

146
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,994
All his talk is so he can get a better price,

147
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,798
so he can make fools of us.

148
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:55,033
Yes.

149
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,114
So he's here to make a fool of me.

150
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,443
Why don't you try it some time?

151
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:01,769
Grandpere dealt with us for two years.

152
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,017
We must have confidence in each other.

153
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,472
That's the way to get along.

154
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:09,649
That's the truth, Pepe.
Well, why don't we get our money and be done with it?

155
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,032
He doesn't speak our language.

156
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,724
Pretend he is not here.

157
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,754
Yes, but I am here.

158
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,967
He doesn't know he's not here.

159
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,660
One more thing he doesn't know will make it practically a perfect score.

160
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,940
He was talking about beauty.

161
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,256
The more he talks about beauty,

162
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,998
the less he talks about money.

163
00:08:28,027 --> 00:08:29,911
And I'm talking about how much.

164
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,333
Oh, you make me sick.

165
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,223
What?

166
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:33,741
Say that again.

167
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,743
You make me sick.

168
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:37,570
Since you make him sick...

169
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:41,349
Ok.

170
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:44,309
Look,

171
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:45,545
but don't touch.

172
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,923
You know, this was once my trade.

173
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:49,909
I began life in a jewelry store.

174
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:53,302
And when you left you took the store with you.
Yeah, it became a habit.

175
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:56,429
You know, I dream about sitting down in Paris sometime.

176
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,196
I'd make a collection of things like this.

177
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,362
Not just for myself,

178
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:00,660
for people to see

179
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:01,667
in glass cases.

180
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:05,168
With you in a uniform taking care of them together.

181
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:06,191
And you, Max.

182
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,361
Me?

183
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,455
You, Pierrot.

184
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,937
Oh, you'd have a uniform like a general,

185
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:13,993
and you'd be in charge of everything.

186
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,215
What about me?

187
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:18,856
What would he be?

188
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:21,372
Stuffed in a glass case?

189
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:22,120
What?

190
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,065
Say that again.

191
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:26,608
Stuffed in a glass case.

192
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,483
Like an Egyptian mummy.

193
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:33,026
Ok.

194
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,361
Hey.

195
00:09:45,796 --> 00:09:46,326
Police !

196
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,525
Police !

197
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:52,250
Police !

198
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,159
Police !

199
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,435
Ah !

200
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,293
You.

201
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,263
Where's Pepe le Moko?

202
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,463
(speaks in arabic "moi...

203
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,773
I don't know him")

204
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:44,076
Cuff him.

205
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:45,717
Uh, uh.

206
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,849
Where's Pepe le Moko?
I don't know.

207
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,209
By the sword of the Great Prophet, I haven't set eyes on him in two weeks.

208
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,473
He hasn't let me look on his face in two weeks.

209
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:55,208
Let him go.

210
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:06,114
Grandpere?

211
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:06,846
Who is he?

212
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,189
Receiver of stolen goods.

213
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:09,598
Do you know where his place is?

214
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:10,331
We know it.

215
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:33,591
Pepe?

216
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:34,339
No.

217
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,122
It's Regis.

218
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:41,601
What's the matter?

219
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:42,551
The police.

220
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,646
They're looking for Pepe.

221
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:44,559
So soon?

222
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:47,061
Soon? Were you expecting them?
Always.

223
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:51,165
But especially tonight. Pepe said they sent someone all the way from Paris.

224
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:52,307
So he knew?

225
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,468
Of course. Pepe knows everything.

226
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:56,056
You're. You're going to him?

227
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,308
Tell him I've never seen so many.

228
00:11:58,755 --> 00:11:59,728
He'll laugh.

229
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:01,462
That's what he expected.

230
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,955
Look. Look at my neck.

231
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:05,447
I thought they were going to wring it like a chicken.

232
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:07,473
But all the time I thought only if Pepe

233
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:11,059
kill me. I thought so long as Pepe.
Why should you feel that way about Pepe?

234
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:13,269
Don't you?

235
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,370
I?

236
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,477
Everyone knows how I feel about Pepe.

237
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:20,529
Pepe doesn't like me. He ignores me. Humiliates me.

238
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,213
But I have my revenge. Sometime he'll be sorry he didn't notice me sooner.

239
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,344
Oh, I'm very humble.

240
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:27,642
I do my best to serve him in my own way.

241
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,342
That's nice of you, Regis.

242
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:30,458
That's how I am.

243
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:32,646
Sensitive. But no one appreciates me.

244
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:34,988
Promise me you'll tell him that I came to warn you.

245
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:35,942
I will.

246
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:37,313
I don't want any favors.

247
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:40,282
I only want him to know that where there's trouble,

248
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:41,729
look for Regis.

249
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:02,635
Third door on the left.

250
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,833
Take three men. Cover the roof.

251
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,034
You men go 'round the back.

252
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:29,015
It's Ines. Quick.

253
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:42,392
The police on the roof, Pepe. They're coming.

254
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:45,594
They surrounded the house. They know you're here.

255
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,196
That's funny.

256
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,580
How did they know I was here?

257
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:54,521
Oh, one can't meditate in peace anymore. Always rush and bustle.

258
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:55,503
I'll take this one.

259
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:56,346
I rather like it.

260
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:02,621
You think that's a toy?

261
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,368
No.
When will you learn to obey orders?

262
00:15:08,353 --> 00:15:08,973
See.

263
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,124
Don't take so many chances.

264
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:12,274
That's foolish.

265
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,737
I don't want a bullet to come between us,

266
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,507
the way that one almost did.

267
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,464
Break it down.

268
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,711
Every few weeks, I have to get new doors.

269
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:02,109
Ines.

270
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:05,177
Did you tell anyone where I was?

271
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,504
No one, Pepe.

272
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,312
Are you sure?

273
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,476
Try to remember.

274
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,281
Why don't you believe me, Pepe?

275
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,869
All I want is to please you.

276
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:13,606
I couldn't lie to you.

277
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:16,156
Couldn't you?

278
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,894
What about all that time you kept telling me that you didn't like me?

279
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,546
But this is serious.

280
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:26,151
Ah, so, love is not serious?
Pepe, it's serious if someone told the police.

281
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:29,488
I didn't talk to anyone. I stayed at home until Regis came.

282
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:30,692
Who came?

283
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:31,502
Regis.

284
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,374
Ahhh.

285
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,430
As soon as he told me, I ran to you.

286
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,635
What did Regis tell you?
Oh, about the police.

287
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:39,340
He wanted me to warn you.

288
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:40,675
It was nice of him.

289
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,184
That's what I thought.

290
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,549
Was that all you thought?

291
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:46,705
Wsa there anything else for me to think?

292
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:49,958
That's what I like about you.

293
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:51,072
What?

294
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,832
Nevermind.

295
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,098
This seems to be all.

296
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:12,151
All for me.

297
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:13,555
Search the place.

298
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:25,822
Hold out your hand.

299
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:29,979
Don't grab.

300
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:31,076
It's unlucky.

301
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,966
You want to give it to me, Pepe?

302
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:35,989
No.

303
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,324
It's for some fat, old woman.

304
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,335
Let me have it, Pepe. Some time, I'll get fat.

305
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:43,041
You'll lose it before that.

306
00:17:43,153 --> 00:17:44,871
I'll keep it for a charm.

307
00:17:44,921 --> 00:17:46,406
Then you must keep your fingers crossed.

308
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,303
Alright.

309
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:54,447
So.

310
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:59,149
This ring will mean that I'm always yours, Pepe,

311
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,319
with my fingers crossed.

312
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:04,730
(crashing sound)

313
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:08,086
Those baboons are turning my house upside down.

314
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,200
They'll be here next.

315
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,176
Let's get out.

316
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:12,610
No, you stay here.

317
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,557
When the police come, you know what to say.

318
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:19,616
No evidence?

319
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,167
Nothing.

320
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:23,135
Are you satisfied?
I'm never satisfied.

321
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,187
Take your men back to the roof.

322
00:18:25,227 --> 00:18:26,605
The rest of you follow me.

323
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:32,324
There they go.

324
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,710
This way quickly.

325
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:50,789
Come in.

326
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,258
Make yourself comfortable.

327
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,735
What is this? What happened?

328
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,003
Oh, it's nothing.

329
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:56,672
You call this nothing?

330
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,184
Oh, you know how the police are.

331
00:19:58,222 --> 00:19:59,904
They like to keep everything in an uproar.

332
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,466
A very profound observation.

333
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:13,347
The police have been trying to catch him for two years.

334
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,244
Police must be rather stupid.

335
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,952
As one of them, I consider that a triumph of understatement.

336
00:20:18,974 --> 00:20:20,173
You're one of them?

337
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:21,968
I have that doubtful honor.

338
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,100
How does he do it?

339
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:24,041
Mademoiselle.

340
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:26,618
It's not his head that saves him. It's his heart.

341
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:29,443
A man with such a good heart could get around anywhere.

342
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:31,032
Sounds intriguing.

343
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:33,599
It's a matter of taste.

344
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:39,414
Oh, inspector.

345
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,793
Fix it up.

346
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:56,130
Permit me to hope that it's nothing serious.

347
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,154
Thanks.

348
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:58,698
A flea bite.

349
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:31,496
Why aren't you chasing the fox?

350
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:33,463
Oh, such a silly business.

351
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:35,412
I prefer to use my brains.

352
00:21:35,412 --> 00:21:38,175
Well, your friends did a little better than usual tonight.

353
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,401
At least they found me. That's pretty good for them.

354
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,586
Shall we say a step in the right direction?

355
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,388
Excuse us madam if we talk shop.

356
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:46,277
Cigarette?

357
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:47,009
Please.

358
00:21:56,804 --> 00:21:57,833
Let me help you.

359
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:03,847
So.

360
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,718
They surrounded the house?

361
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:06,987
Yes.

362
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,853
They thought I was at Grandpere's.

363
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,258
Poor old man.

364
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:13,497
He has no luck.

365
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,676
They won't even let him sleep in peace.

366
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,152
Sometimes, I feel sorry for them.

367
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:20,518
They'll never get me by this technique, you know.

368
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,148
I've tried to point that out to them.

369
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:25,845
For once we agree,

370
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:27,467
the inspector and I.

371
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:29,452
I am the one who will get you Pepe,

372
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:30,720
in the end.

373
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,788
I can hardly wait for the day.

374
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:35,057
And not only you, but the others,

375
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:38,338
Pierrot, Carlos, Grandpere, all of you.

376
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:40,222
And then what will you do?

377
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:42,114
Put us in the zoo?

378
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:43,793
You flatter yourself.

379
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:45,097
Oh, you mean

380
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:47,291
you won't show me in a cage?

381
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,739
You're important now because you're free.

382
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,969
Once you're behind bars, people will forget all about you.

383
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:56,666
He is funny, my friend Slimane.

384
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,397
He looks normal, doesn't he?

385
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:01,979
But he has delusions of grandeur. He thinks he can arrest me.

386
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,343
That's exactly what I'm going to do Pepe.

387
00:23:05,904 --> 00:23:07,297
Sure.

388
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:09,754
Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.

389
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:12,116
How you make me laugh.

390
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:14,304
Do you know what I like about you?

391
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:17,094
No, but I'm humbly waiting for you to tell me.

392
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,498
Your face.

393
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:21,330
It's a perfect face for your job.

394
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:24,647
To look that false is almost the equivalent of being honest.

395
00:23:24,684 --> 00:23:27,083
I'm honored that my appearance pleases you.

396
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,020
Don't mention it.

397
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:34,592
You'll excuse me?

398
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:36,083
I'm afraid I have to go.

399
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,112
Business.

400
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:44,640
Goodnight, Pepe.

401
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:51,583
It's a shame, isn't it?

402
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:52,257
What?

403
00:23:52,301 --> 00:23:53,623
A waste of talent.

404
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,748
An unusual intelligence.

405
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:58,067
One hates to see him buried so young.

406
00:23:58,067 --> 00:23:59,060
Buried?

407
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,565
It's the same thing.

408
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,854
What makes you so sure?

409
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:07,034
I've marked the date of his arrest on the wall of my room.

410
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,655
High.

411
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,225
Where it reads black in the rays of the setting sun.

412
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,423
Shall we go?

413
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:24,853
And although we narrowly missed capturing Pepe le Moko,

414
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,414
he was evidently wounded while escaping.

415
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:30,154
In fact, his injuries may prove fatal.

416
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:34,593
In the event of his death, I shall inform you without delay.

417
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:37,220
Why don't you just declare him dead and be done with it?

418
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:41,050
You may rest assured that I have the situation well in hand

419
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,969
and will take whatever steps I deem advisable.

420
00:24:43,969 --> 00:24:46,159
Wire that to Paris immediately.

421
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,567
What does he mean by saying he has the situation well in hand?

422
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:58,396
He means he's going to sit here and write letters to Paris,

423
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,553
while he waits for Pepe to die of old age.

424
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:03,090
That's better than going into the Casbah looking for him.

425
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,219
At least our friend from Paris has learned something about the Casbah.

426
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:08,923
We've all learned that there's only one way to arrest Pepe.

427
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:11,070
Oh, that's very intelligent of you.

428
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,161
As you know, my intelligence is at your service.

429
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,008
Well so far, it's hardly been enough.

430
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:16,151
Ah, but wait.

431
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:18,056
Suppose Pepe comes out of the Casbah.

432
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:20,514
Then it follows, his arrest is a matter of child's play.

433
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:23,157
Shall we send him an engraved invitation?

434
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:27,056
Pepe is too clever to fall into a trap,

435
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:29,040
but some of his friends are not so clever.

436
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,028
Get to the point.

437
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,485
Suppose Pierrot comes down into the town,

438
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,127
Pepe would be worried about his absence,

439
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:37,175
and he'll come down into the town to find him.

440
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:40,332
You've overlooked just one little point. How do you get Pierrot to come down?

441
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,200
Ah, that's my plan.

442
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,730
Magnificent plan.

443
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:46,417
I have here a letter.

444
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,100
I got it from Pierrot.

445
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,481
But he doesn't know that.

446
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,752
The letter is from his mother.

447
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,828
A letter of exquisite tenderness.

448
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:53,917
From France.

449
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:56,451
Can't see much value in that.

450
00:25:56,505 --> 00:25:58,324
He's a bad boy but a good son.

451
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:00,390
So it isn't the good son that we'll lock up,

452
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:01,300
but the bad boy.

453
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,004
Then, we keep the arrest a secret

454
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:05,929
and Pepe will come down out of the Casbah to look for Pierrot.

455
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,047
Are we agreed?

456
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,525
Agreed.

457
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:14,192
And...

458
00:26:14,192 --> 00:26:15,853
as to the price?

459
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:17,597
You know the reward has been posted.

460
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:19,649
But a little bonus besides

461
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,806
in view of the circumstances?

462
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:22,522
Agreed.

463
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,456
How do we know we can trust you not to make a better bargain with Pepe?

464
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:29,354
I'm an informer

465
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:30,522
not a hypocrite.

466
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,942
What are you laughing at?

467
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,684
It amuses me to see you sell your friend at bargain prices.

468
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:39,870
You have a flair for business, Regis.

469
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,609
He says that because he's jealous. It doesn't upset me.

470
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:47,335
I ignore him.

471
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:10,875
Double him, dear. He'll never make it.

472
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:15,619
Good morning, Tanya.

473
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:18,177
Good morning, Inspector.
And how is Carlos?

474
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,404
How would he be?

475
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:22,794
Don't tell me your charming husband has been beating you again.

476
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,521
You know how it is with a man.

477
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,397
Well, I can't say I do.

478
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:28,345
Thay seem to take to it naturally.

479
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:34,711
Morning, pretty.

480
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,072
Good morning, Pepe.

481
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,170
Good morning, Pepe.

482
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,347
Hello.

483
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:41,275
Good morning, Pepe.

484
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:42,567
Good morning.

485
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,131
You better watch out, Pepe.

486
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,891
Women will be the death of you.
It's a happy death.

487
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,435
I'm just warning you.

488
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:50,314
Don't worry. I'll keep my head.

489
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:53,771
I may need it one of these days.

490
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:54,681
No doubt.

491
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,718
Coming my way?

492
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:56,733
With pleasure.

493
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,059
Good morning, Pepe.

494
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:04,732
Morning.

495
00:28:06,437 --> 00:28:07,657
Good morning, Pepe.

496
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:09,010
Morning.

497
00:28:10,305 --> 00:28:12,306
Did you get home safely last night?

498
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:13,168
Why not?

499
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,267
Morning, Pepe.

500
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:14,916
Morning.

501
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:17,464
Nothing unpleasant?

502
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:20,356
Yes, we had one rather unpleasant experience.

503
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:21,142
Yeah?

504
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:22,227
With you.

505
00:28:22,227 --> 00:28:23,598
She didn't think so.

506
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,144
What makes you so sure?
What is she saying?

507
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,331
Well, you know women. They talk about nothing. I hardly listen.

508
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,316
Was there anything special about her?

509
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,286
Yes.

510
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:34,069
Pearls.

511
00:28:34,757 --> 00:28:36,160
The corner I like.

512
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,770
Handcuffs I can appreciate.

513
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:40,010
Platinum and diamonds.

514
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:43,182
And she didn't buy that perfume in Algiers.

515
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:46,433
So all you noticed were the jewels and perfume.

516
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:47,770
Was there anything else?

517
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:49,866
What about the eyes?

518
00:28:49,866 --> 00:28:51,339
They all have eyes,

519
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:52,974
but all that shi shi and jingle,

520
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:54,856
you don't see much of that in the Casbah.

521
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,671
But you do where she comes from.

522
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:57,321
Thank you.

523
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:05,695
She asked quite a few questions about you.

524
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,067
Yeah? What did you tell her?

525
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,631
What could I tell her?

526
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:12,952
Why? Did you think she might be afraid of my past?

527
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:16,170
No, but she might be a little appalled at your future.

528
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,188
I told her you might get off in 20 years with a good lawyer.

529
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:24,363
You wouldn't want me to get 20 years. You're too fond of me. What's her name?

530
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,941
So, you're thinking about her.

531
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:30,156
How could I be thinking about her when I don't know her name?

532
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,469
-Good morning, Pepe.
-Hello, Aicha.

533
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:38,608
Pierrot at home?

534
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:39,635
No, he's at Shinee's.

535
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:41,056
Let's go to Shinee.

536
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:45,657
What do you want?

537
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:49,066
I have a letter for Pierrot.

538
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:49,928
Give it to me.

539
00:29:49,928 --> 00:29:52,171
Oh, no no no. I can't.

540
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:56,067
I swore by the ghosts of my ancestors to give it only to Pierrot.

541
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:57,332
Whose the letter from?

542
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,133
A woman.

543
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,279
What kind of a woman?

544
00:30:00,373 --> 00:30:01,671
I didn't look.

545
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:03,524
Well, you tell the woman I took it away from you.

546
00:30:03,557 --> 00:30:05,124
(humming)

547
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:12,880
(humming)

548
00:30:16,103 --> 00:30:20,998
This vulgar game is hardly worth the compromise to ones dignity involved in playing it.

549
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,948
It's vulgar, but it's fast.

550
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,779
I don't know why I waste my time in such common pursuits

551
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,118
with such mediocre companions.

552
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:32,575
My youth?

553
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:34,859
I intended to become a statesman.

554
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:35,737
Or?

555
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:36,706
Philosopher.

556
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:40,921
But a man's destiny is written in the stars.

557
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:55,912
We play the game.

558
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:58,769
But Fate controls the cards.

559
00:30:59,297 --> 00:30:59,918
Who?

560
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:01,172
Fate.

561
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,988
If Fate goes on controlling the cards,

562
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,588
he might find a knife between his ribs.

563
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,394
The moving finger writes.

564
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,950
Ans having writ

565
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,490
moves on.

566
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,065
Stop that nonsense.

567
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,700
He has an ear but not for poetry.

568
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,468
I'm trying to think.

569
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,027
I would have played the ace.

570
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,860
Do you smell something?

571
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,969
I've been wondering.

572
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:45,819
Onions.

573
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:48,291
Cheese.
A mixture of cheese and onions.

574
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:49,225
I don't like it.

575
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:52,711
Would it be to much to ask you to take your nose out of my hand?

576
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,487
But you haven't got a hand.

577
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:56,050
Don't blow down my back.

578
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,092
You seem nervous.

579
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,068
My dear fellow,

580
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,637
consider yourself blackballed by this club.

581
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:03,941
He means get out.

582
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:06,037
Oh.

583
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,407
What are you hanging around for? This is business.

584
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,326
Read this.

585
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:17,479
Bad news?

586
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,417
Pierrot.

587
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:22,032
Wait for me.

588
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:30,792
I would like it better if you didn't hang around so much

589
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:31,714
with Regis.

590
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,322
Why?

591
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:38,057
Did you ever see a clock that pointed to two and struck four

592
00:32:38,093 --> 00:32:40,067
when it is really quarter past twelve?

593
00:32:40,154 --> 00:32:40,837
Well,

594
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:42,395
you will find Regis is like that.

595
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:44,756
He doesn't ring two.

596
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:46,839
That's what you say, but you can't prove it.

597
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:47,534
Well.

598
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,492
If I say so, that's enough.

599
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:51,235
Regis gets along alright with me.

600
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,910
That's why I'm telling you. I don't like it.

601
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:53,691
Well I do.

602
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,307
In business, I'll do anything you say, Pepe.

603
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:57,101
But outside business I'll do as I please.

604
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,598
Oh, so.

605
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:03,261
You'll do as you please?

606
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:09,642
It's a good thing I like you.

607
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:11,153
Now get out.

608
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,145
Nice kid.

609
00:33:20,576 --> 00:33:22,406
What did she write you in her last letter?

610
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:25,120
She had a cold. She said she'd start as soon as she felt better.

611
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,775
Ah, then you knew she was coming.

612
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:27,764
I sent her a money order.

613
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:29,428
In that case, it isn't so strange.

614
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:32,143
And yet it's odd that she should arrive in Algiers like that

615
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,277
without letting you know,

616
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,807
That's what I thought.
Ah.

617
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,486
Is this her handwriting?

618
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:37,913
Have you another letter?

619
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:41,200
Yes, I think so.
Good. We'll put them both together

620
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:43,036
like a pair of Siamese twins.

621
00:33:43,068 --> 00:33:45,536
Then we'll see if they're both from the same mama.

622
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:51,977
Well, what do you think?

623
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:53,745
Same mistakes in spelling.

624
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:56,587
Our poor dear mamas can never spell.

625
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:57,670
Same 'n'.

626
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,478
Same what?

627
00:33:58,478 --> 00:33:59,210
Same 'n'.

628
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,883
And the crossing of the 't'.

629
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:03,750
Well, that settles it. You can always tell by the crossing of the 't'.

630
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,422
Then, you think it's alright?
Well, you can see with your own eyes.

631
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,579
Then, I don;t want her to be there worrying.

632
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:11,542
-After all, she's 62.
-Oh, my mother lived to 84.

633
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:14,647
She never felt better than the day she died.

634
00:34:15,947 --> 00:34:17,357
Where's that?

635
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,106
If I know it well, half hour's walk.

636
00:34:19,145 --> 00:34:21,288
I can take you there if you wish to go.

637
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,949
I've got to go. I've got to see her.

638
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:25,980
Fortunately, you can rely on me.

639
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,507
It's good of you to help me, Regis.

640
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:28,596
You're a real friend.

641
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:30,004
Well, that's how I am. Sensitive.

642
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:47,815
You ready, Gaby?

643
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,492
Andre just phoned. They're waiting on the terrace.

644
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:53,137
If I sat for five minutes, Andre phones.

645
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:55,329
Well, don't you like having him so attentive?

646
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:57,176
Love it.

647
00:34:58,405 --> 00:34:59,942
I've just been sitting here,

648
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:02,546
thinking that I'm the happiest girl in the world.

649
00:35:02,582 --> 00:35:03,417
Well, you ought to be.

650
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:08,405
Marrying a man who adores you and can give you everything in the world you ever dreamed about.

651
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:10,394
That's my trouble.

652
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,309
I'm such a fool.

653
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,225
I go dreaming about the wrong things.

654
00:35:15,254 --> 00:35:16,960
Well, that's a terrible mistake.

655
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,441
Marie,

656
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,081
remember the time

657
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,414
in the Baltoin Bargain Basement.

658
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:25,100
The two of behind a counter. Handkerchiefs. Gloves.

659
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,325
Hosiery.

660
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,666
And don't you forget it.

661
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:32,954
I won't.

662
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,684
After all, you don't marry for fun.

663
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,089
I didn't.

664
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:45,070
Hello, Inspector.

665
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,345
So you've already met.

666
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:48,673
I took the liberty of presenting myself.

667
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:53,187
As you see, I couldn't wait to take advantage of your invitation last night.

668
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:54,219
I'm glad.

669
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:55,516
Yes, we're all glad.

670
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:57,390
Inspector,

671
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:01,079
will you tell my fiance where I was last night during the shooting?

672
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,024
But with me.

673
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,394
There you see?

674
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,771
And who did we meet?

675
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:06,028
Pepe le Moko.

676
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:07,623
Nice friends you have.

677
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,623
In prisoners, one can't choose.

678
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:11,870
You don't mean Pepe le Moko,

679
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:13,241
the famous criminal?

680
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:15,510
The one they're all talking about?

681
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:18,725
He'd like to hear you say that.
Just a common law-breaker.

682
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:21,753
Have you seen him since?

683
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:24,291
This morning.

684
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,305
Did he say anything bout me?

685
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:28,124
Well, in a way.

686
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,827
Oh, I know.

687
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:30,956
My pearls.

688
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:34,704
A connoisseur can admire pearls without neglecting the wearer.

689
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,792
Oh, he means if he stole your pearls, he'd steal you with them.

690
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:40,209
Does that frighten you, Gaby?

691
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:42,017
Oh, it sounds marvelous to me.

692
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:42,991
I'd like to meet him.

693
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:44,972
It could easily be arranged

694
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:49,614
if you wish to visit the Casbah again with a suitable guide.

695
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:51,374
How's that, Andre? An adventure.

696
00:36:51,374 --> 00:36:53,388
Well, that's what we're here for.

697
00:36:53,427 --> 00:36:55,837
Once is enough for me. I don't like natives.

698
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:59,530
Then, we'll go with Maxim. You'll protect us. Won't you, Maxim?

699
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,490
I'm at my best among natives.

700
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:06,456
Tonight, Inspector? If it's convenient.

701
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:07,609
Uh huh.

702
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:09,259
Pepe.

703
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:10,694
Yes.

704
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:12,023
What are you doing?

705
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:13,462
Nothing.

706
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:25,755
What are you looking at like that?

707
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:26,763
France.

708
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,720
You can't see France.

709
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:31,783
Well, there is no harm in trying.

710
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,730
Pepe, what are you looking at like that?

711
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:35,872
A ship.

712
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:39,414
Doesn't it make you seasick to look at boats?

713
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,403
Doesn't it give you a headache to ask so many questions?

714
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:42,978
No.

715
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,446
Why? Have you got a headache?

716
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:47,608
No. I'm thinking.

717
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,971
Well, that's sure to give you a headache.

718
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:54,470
I don't think with my head but with my heart.

719
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,888
Then, you'd better tell me.

720
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:56,894
It's nothing.

721
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:58,652
If it's nothing, you'd better tell me.

722
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:00,767
Oh, I'll get mad if you go on like this.

723
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:02,272
I want you to get mad.

724
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:03,435
Shout at me and hurt me,

725
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,558
but don't treat me as if I'm not here.

726
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:09,012
Oh, I know you're here.
No you don't.

727
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:18,988
You're dreaming about something

728
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:20,693
with your eyes wide open.

729
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,397
I wish you'd dream about me.

730
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:28,228
Look.

731
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,290
You've always lived in the Casbah.

732
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,541
For you, there is nothing outside.

733
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:34,922
The Casbah is big enough.

734
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:36,034
Not for me.

735
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,704
It's like being in a grave.
Pepe.

736
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,721
Can't stand much more of it.

737
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:43,583
If you want to go away, I'll go with you.

738
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:46,431
Thanks.

739
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:49,456
Won't you take me?

740
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:51,464
I wish I could.

741
00:38:54,474 --> 00:38:56,005
Paris is a long way off.

742
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:57,203
I don't care.

743
00:38:57,981 --> 00:38:59,200
It's different there.

744
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:04,181
Couldn't you be happy with me in Paris?

745
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,224
You think I'd look funny in Paris.

746
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:13,691
Answer me.

747
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:15,463
Oh, but it isn't you, Ines.

748
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:16,619
It's the Casbah.

749
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,063
You belong here.

750
00:39:18,415 --> 00:39:19,882
You don't understand the way I feel.

751
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,818
I've stood it for two years.

752
00:39:24,434 --> 00:39:26,855
The time comes when you can't stand anymore.

753
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,464
Morning, noon, and night.

754
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:31,945
The same things. The same people.

755
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:33,145
I'm fed up.

756
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:34,274
I've had enough.

757
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:35,342
You're tired of me.

758
00:39:35,404 --> 00:39:36,909
It has nothing to do with you.

759
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,033
I want to get away.

760
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,314
That has nothing to do with me?

761
00:39:42,989 --> 00:39:46,446
Do you know when you're going away? Never.
You'll see.

762
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:47,579
You can't do it.

763
00:39:47,617 --> 00:39:48,698
Never.

764
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:51,653
I am the Casbah. I'll keep you.

765
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:54,442
Just try to get away and you will find out.

766
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:57,533
It's funny for the police to come in and try to arrest you.

767
00:39:57,582 --> 00:40:00,843
You're in prison already. You're in the Casbah with the wall around you.

768
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:01,689
Stop it.

769
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,298
There's nothing else. You'll never have anything else.

770
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:04,290
Stop it I tell you.

771
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:08,267
I am glad. There is no France for you. No Paris. No boulevards.

772
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:09,707
Are you through?
No.

773
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:46,238
Who is it?

774
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:47,774
Pierrot?

775
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:49,441
It's me, Aicha

776
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,198
Pepe.

777
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,714
I don't know what to do.

778
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:12,816
Pierrot.

779
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:14,199
I can't find him.

780
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:16,187
Did you go to Shinee's?

781
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:16,678
Yes.

782
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:19,083
And I Mother Teche's and the Ali Baba

783
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,887
and the Algerians.

784
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,383
Everywhere.

785
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:24,923
-He ought to be back by now.
-Back?

786
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:29,731
Why did he go into town?

787
00:41:29,731 --> 00:41:31,156
To see his mother.

788
00:41:33,773 --> 00:41:35,717
What do you mean to see his mother?

789
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,038
He got a letter from her.

790
00:41:37,096 --> 00:41:38,216
L'Arbi brought it.

791
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:39,771
Then, he went down with Regis.

792
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:41,992
And then Regis came back, but Pierrot

793
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,013
I'm still waiting for him, that's all.

794
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:47,761
Where's Regis?

795
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:48,946
At the Algerians.

796
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,131
No need to go down.

797
00:42:03,806 --> 00:42:04,642
See you later.

798
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:10,229
Hello, Regis.

799
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,062
What's your hurry?

800
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,236
Oh, I'm in no hurry.

801
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:13,889
Good. Then, come along with me.

802
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:16,072
I'm waiting for Pierrot. We can wait for him together.

803
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,724
But listen, Pepe. I've got to go down.

804
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:20,264
What's the matter? What makes you so nervous?

805
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:21,310
Me? Nervous?

806
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,492
Why should I be nervous?

807
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:23,798
That's just it. Why?

808
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:28,859
Well. It's only that usually you hardly say hello to me and when you do so I don't expect it when you don't.

809
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,230
I'm a little surprised when you do because you don't usually.

810
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,698
Well, you see. I haven't appreciated you at your real value.

811
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,688
That's the trouble.

812
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:37,268
So, I made a mistake.

813
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:38,266
Shall we go?

814
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:41,239
Where?
Oh, any quiet corner where we can talk.

815
00:42:41,281 --> 00:42:44,030
I've been hearing great stories about your courage.

816
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,034
My courage?

817
00:42:45,608 --> 00:42:47,979
You're surprised?
No.

818
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:50,784
I even hear you proved it.
Me?
Yes, you.

819
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:55,043
Well, it's possible. One can be brave without knowing it.

820
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:56,246
Of course.

821
00:42:56,246 --> 00:42:59,635
How? How did I prove it?

822
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:02,339
Why by going down into town with Pierrot.

823
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:05,016
Ah, not everybody would have done that.

824
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,881
Oh, yes.

825
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:09,161
And after that you came back here.

826
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:11,190
That was a brave thing to do.

827
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,165
Yes. Wasn't it?

828
00:43:16,439 --> 00:43:17,770
Now you see

829
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:20,863
why I have completely changed my ideas about you.

830
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:21,983
You're right.

831
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:24,887
I was helping the boy out. Nothing more.
Of course.

832
00:43:28,615 --> 00:43:29,720
Tell me.

833
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,063
Where did you leave Pierrot?

834
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:34,311
Somewhere. I don't quite remember.

835
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:39,088
That's it.

836
00:43:39,808 --> 00:43:42,122
You don't mind if I refresh your memory, do you?

837
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:44,199
He went to see his poor old mother.

838
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:45,285
How is she?

839
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:46,891
I didn't see her.

840
00:43:46,922 --> 00:43:47,587
Why not?

841
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:51,865
She was in bed sick. He didn't want to disturb her.

842
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,824
It must have been an awful shock for Pierrot.

843
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:56,365
He thought she was in France.

844
00:43:56,785 --> 00:43:57,948
I think he got a letter.

845
00:43:58,795 --> 00:43:59,748
Did you see it?

846
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:04,297
Just a glimpse.

847
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:06,344
So you left him?

848
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:08,127
And you came back alone.

849
00:44:08,843 --> 00:44:10,346
He wanted to stay with her.

850
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:12,280
That's natural.

851
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,239
Yes, very natural.

852
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,043
Exactly.

853
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:18,350
Of course.

854
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:31,553
Want me?

855
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:33,829
No, we're just talking.

856
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:34,603
Sit down.

857
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:40,699
Regis did a fine thing today.

858
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:43,103
He went down into town with Pierrot.

859
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:45,112
Fine.

860
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:49,914
And now you're waiting for poor Pierrot.

861
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:53,250
Why poor Pierrot?
Because he went down with Regis.

862
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:54,148
What of it?

863
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:55,413
Nothing.

864
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:57,511
Maybe I should say

865
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,380
and now you're waiting for Pierrot

866
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,044
with poor Regis.

867
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:30,608
What's the matter? Huh?

868
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,635
I've gotta have air.

869
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:35,948
Just relax.

870
00:45:36,118 --> 00:45:37,406
Take it easy.

871
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:41,203
We understand how anxious you are about Pierrot. Here.

872
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:42,354
Take this.

873
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,144
Go ahead. Drink.

874
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:51,731
Don't take a bite out of it.

875
00:45:53,063 --> 00:45:54,385
I don't know what's the matter with me.

876
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:55,399
You'll get over it.

877
00:45:56,102 --> 00:45:57,797
In an hour, you'll feel much better.

878
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,783
Let me go.

879
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:01,159
Let me go.

880
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,111
With a fever like that?

881
00:46:03,308 --> 00:46:05,960
You musn't think of exerting yourself.

882
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:06,893
Cigarette?

883
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,046
Don't make such a fuss.

884
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:10,701
Go on and smoke.

885
00:46:10,738 --> 00:46:12,446
It'll settle your nerves.

886
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:14,492
Say, Pepe.

887
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:17,381
His hair is getting a little long here on his neck.

888
00:46:17,425 --> 00:46:19,581
Don't you think we ought to cut it for him?

889
00:46:20,052 --> 00:46:22,004
You were fond of Pierrot, weren't you?

890
00:46:22,057 --> 00:46:23,762
Oh, I was. I am fond of him.

891
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:25,076
Well, then.

892
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:27,327
You don't want to leave before he gets back.

893
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:29,558
You want to know why he has been detained.

894
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:31,390
-Don't you?
-Yes yes yes.

895
00:46:34,566 --> 00:46:36,116
Must be the fever.

896
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:38,009
I'm worried about you.

897
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:39,465
He's burning up.

898
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:42,117
I'm afraid he'll sizzle before too long.

899
00:46:44,614 --> 00:46:46,187
I don't know anything about Pierrot.

900
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:50,690
Pepe. Pepe. Let me go. You know me; you know I'm alright.

901
00:46:50,722 --> 00:46:53,288
Tell me you do. Last night, I was the one who came to warn you.

902
00:46:53,288 --> 00:46:55,545
Yes, you were the one.
Let me go.

903
00:46:58,455 --> 00:47:01,377
He's delirious.
This is terrible.

904
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:03,489
He may not last the next round.

905
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:07,997
How about a little game to calm him down?
Alright.

906
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:10,751
It is really alarming.

907
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:13,998
If I may say so, he is not at his best.

908
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:16,480
He must stay right where he is.

909
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:18,465
We can't be too careful.

910
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:25,447
What are you doing?

911
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:26,398
Ines.

912
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:32,408
Try to find him, and bring him back. Quick.

913
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:34,184
He went down with Regis.

914
00:47:34,747 --> 00:47:36,020
If you bring him back,

915
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,445
Regis may recover.

916
00:47:38,843 --> 00:47:39,981
Alright.

917
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,962
Cut 'em, Regis.

918
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:58,025
The black spot.

919
00:47:59,216 --> 00:48:01,299
Oh, that's bad.

920
00:48:07,111 --> 00:48:08,886
Suppose you can't find him.

921
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,781
Don't worry.

922
00:48:20,793 --> 00:48:21,545
This way.

923
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:29,501
The women look so mysterious.

924
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:31,792
No doubt they'd say the same about you.

925
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:45,176
Trump?

926
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,120
But you've got a heart.

927
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:49,630
What's the matter with me? I'm not myself.

928
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:51,729
What kind of a game is this?

929
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,852
Concentrate.

930
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:55,312
He's thinking of Pierrot.
Yes, of course.

931
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:59,230
Worry about a friend can cause unutterable anguish to a sensitive nature.

932
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:00,985
Do you mean it makes him sweat?

933
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:05,147
A certain exudation hyper-actuated by an emotional stimulation.

934
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,627
You don't mean him?

935
00:49:06,672 --> 00:49:07,884
Deal me out.

936
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:08,824
Take care of Regis.

937
00:49:08,874 --> 00:49:11,280
Never go back on a friend when he is in trouble.

938
00:49:12,928 --> 00:49:14,279
Still waiting, little one?

939
00:49:48,404 --> 00:49:52,263
You know what this reminds me of? A little place in New York on 42nd street.

940
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:53,778
That's the thing about travelling.

941
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:55,166
There's always something different.

942
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,120
One time, I was in Corsica and I thought I was in Turkey.

943
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,715
Remember the time we were on the Nile and I thought it was Venice?

944
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:07,052
Tell me. Do they have native music here?

945
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,416
On the phonograph.

946
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:10,592
Oh. Well.

947
00:50:25,657 --> 00:50:26,439
What's that one?

948
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:29,995
Never heard of it.

949
00:50:30,499 --> 00:50:31,850
Must be native music.

950
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,231
So you wanted to take another look at this strange, wild animal.

951
00:50:39,988 --> 00:50:40,795
Strange

952
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:42,395
but not so very wild.

953
00:50:43,164 --> 00:50:44,800
How do you like my cage?

954
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,600
I don't know. Yet.

955
00:50:47,355 --> 00:50:48,457
Do you like Algiers.

956
00:50:48,768 --> 00:50:50,981
I don't like travelling; makes me homesick.

957
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:51,695
Does it?

958
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:54,744
I can't see Paris when I open my eyes in the morning.

959
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:56,454
I want to go right back to sleep.

960
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:59,196
Do you know Paris?

961
00:51:01,487 --> 00:51:03,211
Do I know Paris?

962
00:51:06,101 --> 00:51:07,850
Now is summertime.

963
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:09,154
Champs-Élysées.

964
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:10,419
La Gare du Nord.

965
00:51:10,473 --> 00:51:12,495
The Opéra, Boulevard des Capucines

966
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,911
La Chapelle

967
00:51:14,953 --> 00:51:16,000
Rue Montmartre

968
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,673
Boulevard de Rochechouart

969
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:18,895
Rue Fontaine

970
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,758
La Place Blanche.

971
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,468
What a small world.

972
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:35,394
Cigarette?

973
00:51:35,489 --> 00:51:36,063
Thanks.

974
00:51:39,227 --> 00:51:40,136
Got a light?

975
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:46,324
We are a long way from home.

976
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:50,164
Excuse me.

977
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:56,189
Well?

978
00:51:57,056 --> 00:51:59,697
He still thinks he's playing his last card.

979
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,610
Not bad.

980
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:02,740
I'll tell her you said so.

981
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,224
No no no. I mean the rock she's wearing.

982
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:09,119
Now if it was me, I'd get them first and then do the fancy stuff afterward.

983
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:09,935
Shut up

984
00:52:09,935 --> 00:52:11,783
You can't talk to me like that.

985
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:13,058
You heard me. Shut up.

986
00:52:16,353 --> 00:52:17,746
Okay.

987
00:52:20,996 --> 00:52:22,527
He was talking about me.

988
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:23,817
He was worried about you.

989
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:24,859
About me?

990
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:26,443
All that stuff you're holding.

991
00:52:27,789 --> 00:52:28,926
That's nice of him.

992
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:30,248
You're not worried yourself?

993
00:52:30,325 --> 00:52:31,617
No.

994
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:33,611
Not while I'm with you.

995
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:36,601
Right.

996
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:40,214
This is something.

997
00:52:40,214 --> 00:52:43,188
Isn't it? And it hardly weighs anything.

998
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:46,574
At least

999
00:52:46,574 --> 00:52:48,411
20,000 francs.

1000
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:49,731
Add a zero.

1001
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:52,748
I mean what I would get for it.

1002
00:52:54,162 --> 00:52:55,062
Here.

1003
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:56,630
Put it on again.

1004
00:52:57,978 --> 00:52:59,247
You put it on.

1005
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:34,900
Want to dance?

1006
00:53:35,327 --> 00:53:36,113
Yes.

1007
00:54:00,016 --> 00:54:01,016
What's your name?

1008
00:54:01,054 --> 00:54:02,144
Gabrielle.

1009
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:03,250
They call me Gabby.

1010
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:04,080
Married?

1011
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:05,015
No.

1012
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:05,988
Widowed?

1013
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:06,729
No.

1014
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:07,457
Why not?

1015
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,142
Who are you with?

1016
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:10,222
My fiance.

1017
00:54:10,298 --> 00:54:11,225
What is he like?

1018
00:54:11,278 --> 00:54:12,132
Generous.

1019
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:14,320
Stuck being at the hotel?

1020
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,271
I let him.

1021
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:18,707
What are you laughing at?

1022
00:54:18,707 --> 00:54:19,910
It's nothing.

1023
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,743
-Too bad.
-Too bad?

1024
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:23,428
Too bad I don't know you better.

1025
00:54:23,488 --> 00:54:24,368
Why?

1026
00:54:24,409 --> 00:54:26,161
Because I will slap your face.

1027
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:28,976
When people laugh around me, I like to know why.

1028
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,159
This all reminds me of when I was a kid.

1029
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:40,648
We used to dance in the streets

1030
00:54:40,682 --> 00:54:43,479
on holidays, New Years, first of May.

1031
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:45,135
14th of July.

1032
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:46,593
Why do you know?

1033
00:54:46,632 --> 00:54:47,919
What do you think I was doing?

1034
00:54:48,392 --> 00:54:51,659
Too bad you weren't in my
 neighbourhood, Rue de la Bruyère

1035
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:52,772
Rue de la Bruyère?

1036
00:54:52,812 --> 00:54:53,575
That's where I lived.

1037
00:54:53,575 --> 00:54:55,088
I went to school on the hill.

1038
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:57,336
That was almost next door to me.

1039
00:54:57,399 --> 00:54:58,366
No.

1040
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:08,761
Let's go out.

1041
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:10,528
Where to?

1042
00:55:10,576 --> 00:55:11,579
To the terrace.

1043
00:55:15,251 --> 00:55:16,620
Can you see the harbor?

1044
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,696
You can see Montmartre.

1045
00:55:17,825 --> 00:55:19,087
And Les Champs-Élysées.

1046
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:20,418
And Place Blanche.

1047
00:55:21,107 --> 00:55:22,690
I love Place Blanche.

1048
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:24,956
Oh, I can't.

1049
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:26,748
I can't leave my friends.

1050
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:31,577
But I'll come back.

1051
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:32,608
When?

1052
00:55:32,653 --> 00:55:34,127
As soon as I can.

1053
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:34,834
When?

1054
00:55:36,256 --> 00:55:37,238
Tomorrow.

1055
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:39,251
How can I be sure?

1056
00:55:40,082 --> 00:55:41,653
I never break a promise.

1057
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:46,468
Let me go.

1058
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:48,502
Why should I?

1059
00:55:49,703 --> 00:55:50,834
'Cause I ask you.

1060
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:53,316
Say please.

1061
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:56,308
You're rude.

1062
00:55:58,144 --> 00:55:59,026
Am I?

1063
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:08,801
I'll be expecting you.

1064
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,356
Here.

1065
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:14,064
It would be nice if we could meet at Place Blanche.

1066
00:56:24,249 --> 00:56:25,824
Well, what about Pierrot?

1067
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,368
I don't know.

1068
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:29,341
Didn't you go down to find him?

1069
00:56:29,538 --> 00:56:31,477
I didn't want to leave you alone.

1070
00:56:31,507 --> 00:56:33,438
I'm not alone. I'm with madame.

1071
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:34,664
Do as I told you.

1072
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:40,164
Pierrot.

1073
00:56:41,882 --> 00:56:43,338
Where is he?
Who?

1074
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:44,838
Regis. Where is he?

1075
00:56:46,282 --> 00:56:46,831
Come on.

1076
00:56:47,868 --> 00:56:49,156
They got me, Pepe.

1077
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,064
The police.

1078
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:51,910
I didn't listen to you.

1079
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:52,843
I'll help you.

1080
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,272
No. No.

1081
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:48,950
No.

1082
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,156
No.

1083
00:57:50,645 --> 00:57:51,505
No.

1084
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:52,792
No.

1085
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,018
No.

1086
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:55,967
No.

1087
00:57:56,855 --> 00:57:57,555
No.

1088
00:57:58,428 --> 00:57:59,345
No.

1089
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:00,747
No.

1090
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:10,160
No.

1091
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:14,081
Oh, no.

1092
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,177
Pierrot?

1093
00:59:28,903 --> 00:59:30,192
There's no sense to it.

1094
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:31,751
That's what they said.

1095
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:32,914
They?

1096
00:59:33,495 --> 00:59:34,003
Those people.

1097
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:35,291
They were frightened.

1098
00:59:35,648 --> 00:59:36,974
Said they'd never come back.

1099
00:59:48,435 --> 00:59:50,184
I was fond of Pierrot.

1100
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:52,426
I regarded him almost as a son.

1101
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:54,157
Well, he's closed his umbrella.

1102
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,524
Pepe,

1103
00:59:55,888 --> 00:59:58,239
there's no use in thinking about Pierrot.

1104
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,028
Don't you tell me what to think.

1105
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:04,664
This a sad thing.

1106
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:05,623
Are you finished?

1107
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:06,978
I beg your pardon.

1108
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,007
You were fond of him. That's enough.

1109
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:11,660
Can't a man talk?

1110
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:43,302
Well?
Well.

1111
01:00:43,898 --> 01:00:44,766
It's finished.

1112
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:57,217
I did everything you would have done, Pepe.

1113
01:00:58,281 --> 01:01:00,401
I was all alone at the cemetery.

1114
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:02,648
I followed the custom of your people.

1115
01:01:02,854 --> 01:01:04,981
A handful of earth on the body.

1116
01:01:05,463 --> 01:01:06,478
And flowers

1117
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:09,857
to make him feel at home in such a strange place.

1118
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:19,392
It's hard not to be able to go sown to say 
goodbye to your friend on his last journey.

1119
01:01:55,618 --> 01:01:57,018
I'm your friend, Pepe.

1120
01:01:57,472 --> 01:02:01,080
I lnow how you feel; you'er a prisoner in the Casbah.

1121
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:04,913
But the day will come when they won't be able to prevent your leaving.

1122
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,772
You'll go out of the Casbah in spite of them all.

1123
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:13,034
I'll get out whenever I wish.
When you go, you'll go quietly the way Pierrot went.

1124
01:02:13,091 --> 01:02:14,150
Feet first.

1125
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:15,684
Be patient.

1126
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:20,588
When the time comes, they'll take off their hats and let you pass.

1127
01:02:20,628 --> 01:02:21,951
I'll go out alive.

1128
01:02:25,206 --> 01:02:27,233
I don't think you're as foolish as that.

1129
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:34,756
Grandperre,

1130
01:02:35,014 --> 01:02:36,208
I've heard enough.

1131
01:02:40,276 --> 01:02:42,793
Music. Singing. Gibberish.

1132
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:44,204
I'm sorry for you.

1133
01:02:45,555 --> 01:02:46,408
How is she?

1134
01:02:46,465 --> 01:02:47,117
She?

1135
01:02:47,156 --> 01:02:47,983
You know.

1136
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:51,495
I'm afraid you won't see her again. The last visit was a little too much for her.

1137
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,685
She got a bad impression of the Casbah.

1138
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:54,691
It's a pity.

1139
01:02:55,302 --> 01:02:59,147
Why should it be a pity?
For your sake since it seems to mean so much to you.

1140
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:00,035
To me?

1141
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:03,415
So that's what you're so sorry about.

1142
01:03:03,455 --> 01:03:06,427
Why are you standing there staring at me?

1143
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:07,633
Do as I tell you.

1144
01:03:07,676 --> 01:03:08,994
Go down.

1145
01:03:10,127 --> 01:03:11,032
And you too.

1146
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:12,307
Get out.

1147
01:03:12,938 --> 01:03:13,866
I've had enough.

1148
01:03:14,648 --> 01:03:15,574
And you.

1149
01:03:16,033 --> 01:03:17,907
I'm sick of looking at you.

1150
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,851
You seem to be sick of everything.

1151
01:03:23,381 --> 01:03:23,968
Right.

1152
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:27,810
I'd bring her up to see you again if it were possible, but there's no chance.

1153
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:28,919
So.

1154
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,467
She's not coming back.

1155
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:31,894
That's fine.

1156
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:35,586
What?
All that swell jewelry, you had it right in the palm of your hand.

1157
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:36,335
That's enough.

1158
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:39,421
These people who look as if they can tear down everything

1159
01:03:39,477 --> 01:03:42,259
and when a woman looks at them, they get as soft as butter.

1160
01:03:42,304 --> 01:03:44,953
Get out.
Well, I'm not made of butter. Not me.

1161
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:46,466
Get out.
Ok.

1162
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,866
Your friends have no tact, my dear Pepe.

1163
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:52,150
They have no respect for the beauty of your anguish.

1164
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:55,969
I know how it pains you to live among this cattle.

1165
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,473
Let me assure you.
They can't keep me here.

1166
01:03:58,901 --> 01:03:59,962
I'm free.

1167
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:01,205
Free to go.

1168
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:02,572
I'm sick of it.

1169
01:04:03,316 --> 01:04:04,261
All of you.

1170
01:04:04,604 --> 01:04:06,412
I'm sick of listening to you.

1171
01:04:06,902 --> 01:04:08,244
And I'm sick of looking at you.

1172
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:10,671
I'll get out when I feel like it.

1173
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:12,215
None of you can stop me.

1174
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:14,663
Listen to me, Pepe.
I don't need your advice.

1175
01:04:14,928 --> 01:04:15,960
None of you.

1176
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:17,382
I'm free to do as I please.

1177
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:18,962
Free. You hear that?

1178
01:04:18,998 --> 01:04:20,323
You're walking into a trap.

1179
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,916
You know better.
They can't touch me. I'm going down. Get out of the way.

1180
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:27,772
Let me. And when I please is now. Get out of my way.

1181
01:04:36,512 --> 01:04:38,622
He's gone mad. He's going down to the town.

1182
01:04:38,622 --> 01:04:39,690
He won't listen.

1183
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:00,468
Hello.

1184
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:07,083
Good.

1185
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:08,348
I'll attend to it.

1186
01:05:08,422 --> 01:05:10,371
Inspector Slimane.

1187
01:05:10,427 --> 01:05:12,385
He says Pepe le Moko is coming out.

1188
01:05:31,087 --> 01:05:31,890
Pepe.

1189
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:33,031
Pepe, don't go.

1190
01:05:33,086 --> 01:05:34,135
You're mad.

1191
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:41,816
Pepe, don't go. Please don't go.

1192
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,514
I didn't want to tell you this, but she's up there now

1193
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,338
at your old house waiting for you.

1194
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:04,331
Where is she?

1195
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:09,290
Where is she?

1196
01:06:09,915 --> 01:06:11,451
You lied to me, didn't you?

1197
01:06:11,497 --> 01:06:13,132
Answer me. Didn't you?

1198
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:17,304
It was the only way I could keep you from going.

1199
01:06:17,967 --> 01:06:20,113
If I had asked you not to go for me,

1200
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:21,929
you wouldn't have listened to me.

1201
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:23,859
So.

1202
01:06:31,148 --> 01:06:34,183
You ought to be fed up with a fellow like me.

1203
01:06:37,848 --> 01:06:40,494
I didn't know I could make such a fool of myself.

1204
01:06:45,739 --> 01:06:48,105
Ines, have something better than this.

1205
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,552
It's not what you deserve.

1206
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:53,770
It's what you want.

1207
01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:56,487
Why do you worry about me?

1208
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:57,956
It's not good.

1209
01:06:58,427 --> 01:06:59,295
I have a sharp

1210
01:06:59,330 --> 01:07:01,285
that brings me luck.

1211
01:07:03,514 --> 01:07:05,933
You brought us both luck this time.

1212
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,129
All the while I went running,

1213
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:09,981
I kept my hand so.

1214
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,030
But you caught me.

1215
01:07:12,585 --> 01:07:14,821
I didn't know you could run so fast.

1216
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:17,069
Don't forget; I've had practice.

1217
01:07:17,297 --> 01:07:19,324
But nobody ever caught me before.

1218
01:07:21,117 --> 01:07:23,048
Next time, give me a head start.

1219
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:25,720
Next time?

1220
01:07:27,746 --> 01:07:28,791
Don't worry.

1221
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:30,877
Not 'til I catch my breath.

1222
01:07:33,432 --> 01:07:35,076
I'm thirsty.

1223
01:07:35,076 --> 01:07:36,020
I'll get it.

1224
01:07:38,464 --> 01:07:39,476
No you won't.

1225
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,664
Here I am.

1226
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:26,545
I said I'd be here.

1227
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:28,092
Well?

1228
01:08:28,372 --> 01:08:30,260
You look as though you've seen a ghost.

1229
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:41,156
You're beautiful.

1230
01:09:41,862 --> 01:09:43,236
That's easy to say.

1231
01:09:43,254 --> 01:09:45,298
I know a lot of people have told you.

1232
01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:47,734
But what I'm telling you is different. See?

1233
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,382
For me, you're more than that.

1234
01:09:50,672 --> 01:09:52,289
For two years, I've been lost.

1235
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:54,316
Like walking in my sleep.

1236
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:56,426
Slowly I wake up. That's you.

1237
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,561
I don't know what I've been doing all that time, waiting for you without knowing it.

1238
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,025
Do you know what you are to me?

1239
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,982
Paris. That's you.

1240
01:10:06,387 --> 01:10:07,023
Paris.

1241
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,061
With you, I escape.

1242
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:09,811
Follow me?

1243
01:10:10,058 --> 01:10:11,253
The whole town

1244
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:13,275
is spring morning in Paris.

1245
01:10:14,308 --> 01:10:15,805
You're lovely.

1246
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,610
You're marvelous.

1247
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,179
And do you know what you remind me of?

1248
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:24,232
The subway.

1249
01:10:29,786 --> 01:10:31,279
Close your eyes.

1250
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:35,339
Listen.

1251
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:38,228
Can you hear it?

1252
01:10:39,187 --> 01:10:40,979
That's my heart beating.

1253
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:43,320
Dose it go like a subway train?

1254
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:44,687
Faster.

1255
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:47,381
You're all silk,

1256
01:10:47,436 --> 01:10:49,288
and you jingle when you walk.

1257
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,931
And with all that shi shi, you make me think of the subway.

1258
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:53,072
Isn't that funny?

1259
01:10:53,072 --> 01:10:54,394
And potato chips

1260
01:10:54,472 --> 01:10:56,274
and coffee on the boulevard.

1261
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:02,555
What did you do before?

1262
01:11:02,938 --> 01:11:03,787
Before what?

1263
01:11:04,988 --> 01:11:06,191
Before the jewels.

1264
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,226
I wanted them.

1265
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:21,689
It's late.

1266
01:11:21,766 --> 01:11:22,900
I must go.

1267
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:27,828
Suppose you don't come tomorrow.

1268
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:31,986
Suppose I don't.

1269
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:35,340
Can't you ever get away from the Casbah?

1270
01:11:35,593 --> 01:11:36,544
Why do you ask?

1271
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:37,523
Can't you?

1272
01:11:37,578 --> 01:11:37,996
No.

1273
01:11:38,289 --> 01:11:39,492
I'm caught here

1274
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:41,342
like a bear in a hole,

1275
01:11:41,419 --> 01:11:43,757
dogs barking, hunters all around,

1276
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:44,852
no way out of it.

1277
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:46,739
Do you like that?

1278
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:57,255
Maybe it's lucky for you.

1279
01:11:58,538 --> 01:11:59,692
I don't like it.

1280
01:11:59,741 --> 01:12:01,019
And it's not lucky.

1281
01:12:01,758 --> 01:12:02,616
You're right.

1282
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:05,443
If you don't come back, I might do anything.

1283
01:12:05,847 --> 01:12:07,937
I might go down to the hotel to get you.

1284
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:10,429
Tomorrow, Pepe.

1285
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:11,548
Tomorrow?

1286
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:13,711
I never break a promise.

1287
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:35,683
You smell good.

1288
01:12:37,576 --> 01:12:38,643
The subway?

1289
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:40,821
Streamlined.

1290
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:31,710
Hey.

1291
01:13:31,978 --> 01:13:32,798
Anton.

1292
01:13:35,395 --> 01:13:36,125
Tomorrow.

1293
01:13:36,878 --> 01:13:37,803
5 o'clock.

1294
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:57,163
Did you get them?

1295
01:13:57,768 --> 01:13:58,411
What?

1296
01:13:58,491 --> 01:13:59,833
The hardware.

1297
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:02,339
What's the matter with you?

1298
01:14:02,424 --> 01:14:05,290
If you didn't get the jewels, you're simply wasting your time.

1299
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,805
What were you doing in there?

1300
01:14:06,948 --> 01:14:08,413
Where?
There.

1301
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,245
You're mistaken.

1302
01:14:10,817 --> 01:14:11,999
We were not there.

1303
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:13,905
Say that again.

1304
01:14:15,807 --> 01:14:17,151
We were in Paris.

1305
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:18,074
What?

1306
01:14:20,512 --> 01:14:21,779
Okay.

1307
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,900
Life is simple if you try to enjoy before you die every bit of happiness along the way.

1308
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,700
Take the joy that comes to you.

1309
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,000
Suddenly the world is too with the song that keeps you dancing every day.

1310
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,200
That's the life.

1311
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,700
Fall in love and life is sunny.

1312
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:01,400
That's the life you don't need money

1313
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,600
if you've got a little honey in your arms.

1314
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,800
That's the life.

1315
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,400
I'm in heaven and I know it.

1316
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,000
Can I help it if I show it?

1317
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,372
Life is sweet as can be for me.

1318
01:15:14,372 --> 01:15:18,100
Love is very necessary.

1319
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,700
Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.

1320
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,800
You don't know just what you miss if you live without a kiss

1321
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,500
for a kiss can bring your winter into spring.

1322
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:31,500
Everybody will agree. If you fall in love like me, you'll be happy, you will laugh, and you will sing.

1323
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,900
That's the life.

1324
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,300
That's the life we should be living.

1325
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:41,300
Kiss morning, noon, and evening. That's the life that I'll be living.

1326
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,800
That's the moon. That's the life.

1327
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,300
There is nothing like that feeling.

1328
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,900
Tell me what is more appealing

1329
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,700
than the feeling you're in love

1330
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,300
for sure.

1331
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:58,400
Love is very necessary. Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.

1332
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,600
Love is very necessary.

1333
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,411
Fall in love and you'll be happy. That's the life.

1334
01:16:04,411 --> 01:16:06,099
Pepe, what's happened?

1335
01:16:06,152 --> 01:16:07,118
Don't you know?

1336
01:16:07,118 --> 01:16:08,305
It's a holiday.

1337
01:16:08,361 --> 01:16:09,856
No, I didn't know what day it is.

1338
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:12,116
It's Sunday. Everyone gets a holiday.

1339
01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:13,477
But it's not Sunday.

1340
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:15,080
If I say so, it's Sunday.

1341
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:19,117
It's Thursday.
That's the trouble with you; you always think it's Thursday.

1342
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:22,094
I didn't think so yesterday.

1343
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:24,437
Just as a favor to me, let it be Sunday.

1344
01:16:24,488 --> 01:16:26,593
I want to stroll on the boulevard.

1345
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:30,873
I have a date at the Place Blanche.

1346
01:16:39,098 --> 01:16:40,436
Hello, everybody.

1347
01:16:40,998 --> 01:16:42,215
How do you like my singing?

1348
01:16:42,286 --> 01:16:43,580
What's the good of it?

1349
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:47,211
You ought to appreciate the finer things of life.

1350
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:48,564
Who? Him?

1351
01:16:49,754 --> 01:16:51,854
When you feel like that, sing.

1352
01:16:51,854 --> 01:16:53,128
It quiets the nerves.

1353
01:16:54,357 --> 01:16:57,227
You seem pleased. You've seen her again.

1354
01:16:57,274 --> 01:16:58,277
Wouldn't you like to know.

1355
01:16:58,277 --> 01:17:00,316
Oh, well. If you don't want to confide in me.

1356
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:02,781
Well, our inspector got himself a haircut.

1357
01:17:02,793 --> 01:17:03,871
Did she come back?

1358
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,128
A regular Romeo.

1359
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:06,468
You ought to get a permanent wave.

1360
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:08,173
You're expecting her again today?

1361
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:11,242
The trouble with you, Inspector, is that you do too much inspecting.

1362
01:17:11,242 --> 01:17:11,801
Now,

1363
01:17:11,962 --> 01:17:13,752
not a word about what I have told you.

1364
01:17:13,931 --> 01:17:15,393
Just between ourselves,

1365
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:16,853
yup.

1366
01:17:46,337 --> 01:17:47,501
Inspector.

1367
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:48,851
Good afternoon.

1368
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:51,323
I was puzzled when you phoned.

1369
01:17:51,585 --> 01:17:54,387
My mission is a rather delicate one

1370
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,176
but necessary.

1371
01:17:57,099 --> 01:17:58,818
I merely wish to suggest that

1372
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:02,040
your fiance is a little too fond of

1373
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:06,623
shall we say, the local color of the Casbah.

1374
01:18:08,056 --> 01:18:09,221
What is all this?

1375
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,885
The Casbah is hardly the place for a woman alone.

1376
01:18:12,928 --> 01:18:14,764
She attracts too much attention,

1377
01:18:14,826 --> 01:18:16,791
excites too much desire.

1378
01:18:17,569 --> 01:18:21,038
If we, naturally, wish to protect her from any embarrassment.

1379
01:18:22,276 --> 01:18:25,664
Further embarrassment can very easily be avoided.

1380
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:28,968
She must not return to the Casbah.

1381
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:36,797
Come in.

1382
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:41,193
Sorry to disturb you.

1383
01:18:43,797 --> 01:18:44,838
You're going out?

1384
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:45,810
Looks that way.

1385
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:46,757
Where are you going?

1386
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:47,752
A walk.

1387
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:48,939
But where?

1388
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,680
In the Champs-Élysées.

1389
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:52,970
May I ask you to give me a sensible answer?

1390
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:56,063
Then ask me a sensible question. Where could I go?

1391
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,408
I don't know anyone in Algiers.

1392
01:18:59,084 --> 01:19:00,620
I just walk straight ahead.

1393
01:19:00,665 --> 01:19:01,822
Straight ahead?

1394
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:03,602
And where does that take you?

1395
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:05,217
I'll know when I get there.

1396
01:19:05,217 --> 01:19:05,890
No you won't

1397
01:19:06,448 --> 01:19:07,314
because you're not going.

1398
01:19:07,463 --> 01:19:08,872
Oh, yes, my dear.

1399
01:19:09,102 --> 01:19:10,594
Your hotel bores me.

1400
01:19:10,648 --> 01:19:12,639
The head waiter looks like an undertaker.

1401
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:15,351
An every time I step into this apartment

1402
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,452
it looks more like a funeral parlor.

1403
01:19:17,505 --> 01:19:18,721
Goodbye, darling.

1404
01:19:20,945 --> 01:19:22,150
I know where you're going.

1405
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:24,041
Ah?
You're going to the Casbah.

1406
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,021
So?
You go there every day.

1407
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:28,055
Do I?
To meet Pepe le Moko.

1408
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,529
So now you're spying on me?

1409
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:35,648
You're going to be my wife.

1410
01:19:35,898 --> 01:19:37,662
You don't make it a very pleasant prospect.

1411
01:19:37,662 --> 01:19:39,658
And I won't allow you to behave like this.

1412
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,218
I'm glad you told me.

1413
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:42,278
What do you mean?

1414
01:19:44,261 --> 01:19:45,433
We've got to be honest.

1415
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:47,584
Why do you think I'm marrying you?

1416
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,911
Look at yourself, and now look at me.

1417
01:19:49,963 --> 01:19:51,334
I've never lied to you.

1418
01:19:51,591 --> 01:19:55,562
You knew I didn't love you when I promised to marry you, and you though it was alright.

1419
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,048
Until we are married, I'll do as I please.

1420
01:19:58,116 --> 01:19:59,328
That's fair enough.

1421
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,329
I forbid you to go.

1422
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:02,846
It's a waste of time.

1423
01:20:03,194 --> 01:20:05,816
If you go now, there'll be no use in you coming back.

1424
01:20:06,645 --> 01:20:09,149
You've thought it all out pretty clearly. Haven't you?

1425
01:20:09,212 --> 01:20:11,346
And I advise you to do the same.

1426
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:12,699
Alright.

1427
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:13,780
Goodbye.

1428
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:16,446
Do it, Gaby. Don't.

1429
01:20:20,824 --> 01:20:21,623
No.

1430
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:22,770
What?

1431
01:20:22,836 --> 01:20:24,517
You can't go to the Casbah.

1432
01:20:24,574 --> 01:20:25,358
But really.

1433
01:20:25,435 --> 01:20:27,492
Your fiance was trying to spare you.

1434
01:20:27,643 --> 01:20:29,676
He didn't want to tell you the truth as I told it to him.

1435
01:20:30,294 --> 01:20:33,956
An attempt was made to capture Pepe le Moko this afternoon.

1436
01:20:33,956 --> 01:20:35,826
The attempt was successful.

1437
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:36,821
He was taken?

1438
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:37,882
Not alive.

1439
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,305
He was killed.

1440
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:30,130
I just came to tell you, it's Thursday.

1441
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:32,033
I know.

1442
01:21:33,049 --> 01:21:34,985
I was right all the time.

1443
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,238
You see, I'm not just a fool as you think.

1444
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:41,294
So this is the Place Blanche.

1445
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:45,431
It's not much fun on Thursday, is it?

1446
01:21:45,523 --> 01:21:47,633
It doesn't seem like Paris.

1447
01:22:01,555 --> 01:22:02,976
What's got into him?

1448
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:06,272
Weren't you ever disappointed in love?

1449
01:22:06,332 --> 01:22:07,597
Yes. Badly.

1450
01:22:08,582 --> 01:22:10,787
I'll try to please you.

1451
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,008
I'm like Pepe.

1452
01:22:13,452 --> 01:22:14,933
I like 'em with diamonds.

1453
01:22:15,466 --> 01:22:16,870
Now he's missed his chance.

1454
01:22:17,952 --> 01:22:23,112
So I guess I'll have to go downtown and give my personal attention to madam's hardware.

1455
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:25,692
What steamer?

1456
01:22:26,445 --> 01:22:28,998
The Ville d'Algers? Ten o'clock? Good.

1457
01:22:29,056 --> 01:22:30,217
Make the reservation.

1458
01:22:31,425 --> 01:22:32,389
Are you leaving?

1459
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,654
I suppose you won't stay for the funeral.

1460
01:22:38,915 --> 01:22:40,614
Four. First class.

1461
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:42,985
Oh. Send up some whiskey and soda.

1462
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:46,357
You'll have a drink.

1463
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:48,279
Just a short one.

1464
01:22:48,814 --> 01:22:49,950
Make you feel better.

1465
01:23:02,192 --> 01:23:03,215
Anything wrong?

1466
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:05,611
Why don't you sing?

1467
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:07,265
Why don't you mind your own business?

1468
01:23:07,632 --> 01:23:08,536
I am.

1469
01:23:08,755 --> 01:23:11,038
Only I just though you might be interested.

1470
01:23:11,363 --> 01:23:12,883
I'm going downtown.

1471
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:14,110
What for?

1472
01:23:14,193 --> 01:23:15,534
Unlike you, I'm bored.

1473
01:23:16,016 --> 01:23:17,414
Anything in your mind?

1474
01:23:17,455 --> 01:23:19,462
Just to look things over.

1475
01:23:19,842 --> 01:23:22,799
-When are you going?
-Now. No use to see a lawyer about it.

1476
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:24,773
-Do me a favor.
-Sure.

1477
01:23:24,903 --> 01:23:26,291
I want you to deliver a letter.

1478
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:28,184
I'd take anything that isn't loaded.

1479
01:23:29,552 --> 01:23:31,951
Ok. I get the idea.

1480
01:23:32,028 --> 01:23:34,128
Maybe I don't look like Cupid, but I'll manage.

1481
01:23:35,338 --> 01:23:36,398
Pen and paper.

1482
01:23:36,907 --> 01:23:38,997
Go to the servants' entrance.

1483
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:40,395
Give someone a good tip.

1484
01:23:40,544 --> 01:23:42,334
And tell them you've got to have an answer.

1485
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:45,362
Don't worry. I won't come back empty handed.

1486
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:47,823
I'll wait for you at your house.

1487
01:23:47,882 --> 01:23:50,172
I'll be back in two hours. Tell Tania.

1488
01:23:50,451 --> 01:23:51,172
Good luck.

1489
01:23:59,397 --> 01:24:00,578
What time is it?

1490
01:24:01,444 --> 01:24:02,627
9 o'clock.

1491
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,413
Is that all?

1492
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:05,859
In the morning.

1493
01:24:06,373 --> 01:24:07,979
Sun is out.

1494
01:24:08,385 --> 01:24:09,916
I slept all that time?

1495
01:24:11,731 --> 01:24:12,604
Carlos?

1496
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,086
He hasn't come back.

1497
01:24:14,634 --> 01:24:15,826
He hasn't come back?

1498
01:24:16,353 --> 01:24:17,938
I sat up all night.

1499
01:24:19,892 --> 01:24:22,970
I'd like to see him back with what I've got to tell him.

1500
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:26,008
This time, I'll make him listen to me.

1501
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:28,716
Poor Carlos.

1502
01:24:28,842 --> 01:24:32,817
Same old story.

1503
01:24:33,288 --> 01:24:34,245
Well.

1504
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:35,741
Life is like that.

1505
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:36,385
Yeah.

1506
01:24:36,628 --> 01:24:40,154
And we're dumb enough to hang on because we don't want to stir it when.

1507
01:24:42,186 --> 01:24:42,938
Smart.

1508
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:45,900
Is Pepe here?

1509
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,903
What do you want?

1510
01:24:47,186 --> 01:24:50,290
We've been looking for you everywhere. Why weren't you at home?

1511
01:24:50,554 --> 01:24:51,672
Because I'm here.

1512
01:24:51,731 --> 01:24:53,029
What do you want, L'Arbi?

1513
01:24:54,443 --> 01:24:55,842
I must speak to you alone.

1514
01:24:55,939 --> 01:24:56,946
What's the matter with us?

1515
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:58,249
Ever got small pox?

1516
01:24:58,316 --> 01:25:00,838
-It's alright; you can talk.
-Pepe, I'm ashamed of myself.

1517
01:25:00,921 --> 01:25:02,044
What's new about that?

1518
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:04,422
-Oh, It's more than you think.
-I doubt that.

1519
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,154
Go ahead and insult me.

1520
01:25:06,313 --> 01:25:07,364
I deserve it.

1521
01:25:07,364 --> 01:25:08,522
You flatter yourself.

1522
01:25:08,607 --> 01:25:10,989
It's about the letter from Pierrot's mother.

1523
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:14,281
I brought it and gave it to Aicha, but I didn't know it was from the police.

1524
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:17,640
If I had known the letter was written by Regis, I wouldn't have done it. Never.

1525
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:18,472
Go on.

1526
01:25:19,459 --> 01:25:21,333
It was really a woman who gave me the letter.

1527
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:25,260
I, if I had known the truth, I wouldn't have touched it.

1528
01:25:25,342 --> 01:25:26,578
I'm an informer.

1529
01:25:26,652 --> 01:25:28,788
Yes, but I wouldn't have done a thing like that.

1530
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:30,811
Oh, you're only half an informer.

1531
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:32,171
The other half is alright.

1532
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,969
Oh, that's why I'm here.

1533
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,766
For what?

1534
01:25:35,407 --> 01:25:39,338
I couldn't stand it any longer. Forgive me, Pepe.

1535
01:25:39,338 --> 01:25:41,975
Alright. Stop grovelling; it makes me sick.

1536
01:25:42,037 --> 01:25:43,776
I want you to have a good opinion of me.

1537
01:25:43,883 --> 01:25:44,633
So?

1538
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,879
I want you to believe me.

1539
01:25:46,946 --> 01:25:48,075
That's why I'm here,

1540
01:25:48,362 --> 01:25:49,352
to tell you

1541
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:51,372
they got Carlos.

1542
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:52,723
What about Carlos?

1543
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:54,688
The police took him.

1544
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:58,852
-How much did you sell him for?
-I wouldn't be here if I'd sold him.

1545
01:25:59,408 --> 01:26:01,185
First Pierrot, then Carlos.

1546
01:26:01,251 --> 01:26:03,448
Bad luck always runs in threes.

1547
01:26:03,567 --> 01:26:05,067
Your turn will be next, Pepe.

1548
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,496
Don't be so sure.

1549
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:07,898
So they arrested him.

1550
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,971
Who did it?

1551
01:26:09,035 --> 01:26:10,146
Inspector Louvain.

1552
01:26:10,256 --> 01:26:12,380
They were about a dozen of them surrounding him.

1553
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,334
Was there any shooting?

1554
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:17,248
No, no. They managed very quietly in a nice way.

1555
01:26:17,522 --> 01:26:18,929
What did you have to do with it?

1556
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,377
I was at the police station when they brought Carlos in.

1557
01:26:21,461 --> 01:26:23,265
I had the chance to see him in his cell.

1558
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:24,421
They gave me a letter,

1559
01:26:24,492 --> 01:26:25,673
the one you had given him.

1560
01:26:25,762 --> 01:26:27,424
Told me to take it to the hotel.

1561
01:26:27,438 --> 01:26:30,324
Every time there is a letter, he is the one that brings it.

1562
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:31,303
It looks funny to me.

1563
01:26:31,303 --> 01:26:32,136
Be quiet.

1564
01:26:32,136 --> 01:26:34,851
Oh, I am to be quiet while you write letters to other women?

1565
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:35,648
Never mind that.

1566
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:36,801
You never wrote a letter to me.

1567
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:37,539
Shut up.

1568
01:26:38,859 --> 01:26:41,235
So you went to the hotel with the letter.

1569
01:26:41,318 --> 01:26:42,488
I did it for you, Pepe.

1570
01:26:43,034 --> 01:26:43,830
You get it?

1571
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:44,451
What?

1572
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,077
The answer.

1573
01:26:46,143 --> 01:26:47,568
Oh, she wouldn't write you.

1574
01:26:47,568 --> 01:26:48,549
But she couldn't.

1575
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:50,004
She's being closely watched.

1576
01:26:50,099 --> 01:26:51,502
But she expects you this morning.

1577
01:26:51,709 --> 01:26:53,473
You can go down without any risk.

1578
01:26:53,533 --> 01:26:54,267
Go to her.

1579
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:56,452
Service entrance in the back of the hotel.

1580
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:58,007
She'll be watching from her window.

1581
01:26:58,061 --> 01:26:59,140
Is that all?

1582
01:26:59,246 --> 01:27:00,968
She wants to come out, but she couldn't get away.

1583
01:27:00,968 --> 01:27:04,059
-You're not going out, Pepe. You can't.
-I told you to shut up.

1584
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:05,973
Go on.

1585
01:27:06,258 --> 01:27:08,288
She's waiting for me to bring the answer.

1586
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:10,162
What shall I tell her?

1587
01:27:10,937 --> 01:27:12,469
She's waiting for it.

1588
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:13,426
Yes.

1589
01:27:14,004 --> 01:27:15,806
I'll take the answer myself.

1590
01:27:16,502 --> 01:27:17,804
You wait here.

1591
01:27:19,889 --> 01:27:20,758
But Pepe.

1592
01:27:20,862 --> 01:27:21,740
Don't worry.

1593
01:27:22,131 --> 01:27:24,120
My friends will take good care of you

1594
01:27:24,506 --> 01:27:25,600
until I come back.

1595
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:29,161
But she expects me.

1596
01:27:29,905 --> 01:27:30,324
What?

1597
01:27:31,865 --> 01:27:32,904
Nothing.

1598
01:27:34,218 --> 01:27:35,228
I'll wait.

1599
01:27:36,365 --> 01:27:37,415
Tell me.

1600
01:27:37,588 --> 01:27:38,720
What about Carlos?

1601
01:27:39,618 --> 01:27:40,812
Didn't he say anything else?

1602
01:27:41,307 --> 01:27:41,923
Nothing.

1603
01:27:42,405 --> 01:27:43,466
They search him?

1604
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:44,405
Yes.

1605
01:27:45,614 --> 01:27:47,375
Then they took away the five thousand.

1606
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:48,108
Yes.

1607
01:27:50,109 --> 01:27:53,552
-You're sure he didn't slip the five thousand to you?
-No.

1608
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:54,702
You're sure?

1609
01:27:55,915 --> 01:27:56,637
What?

1610
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:59,848
Lovain took the money. I saw him put it in his desk.

1611
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:04,695
You said Gaby couldn't write because she was watched.

1612
01:28:04,767 --> 01:28:05,338
Yes.

1613
01:28:05,744 --> 01:28:09,492
But in a little while she'll be able to see me.

1614
01:28:10,187 --> 01:28:11,328
That's funny.

1615
01:28:11,893 --> 01:28:13,178
He's going to move away.

1616
01:28:13,265 --> 01:28:14,449
Oh, I see.

1617
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:17,212
-But why couldn't she write to me?
-He was there.

1618
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:18,945
But she talked to you.

1619
01:28:19,028 --> 01:28:20,359
Because.

1620
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:21,877
Because you don't know.

1621
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:24,928
Now there is another thing that doesn't fit in your story.

1622
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:28,652
How was Louvain able to take 5000 francs from Carlos

1623
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:30,401
when Carlos didn't have a hundred?

1624
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:31,328
I don't know.

1625
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:35,977
Do you think Carlos is dumb enough to give you my letter?

1626
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:36,920
All joking aside.

1627
01:28:37,589 --> 01:28:40,108
Do you think me so stupid as to believe he would give it to you?

1628
01:28:40,269 --> 01:28:42,274
-All joking aside.
-I give you my word.

1629
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,077
-And then I will go down to see her.
-Yes.

1630
01:28:46,146 --> 01:28:47,920
A woman who is closely watched,

1631
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,729
it's funny the way she can do things.

1632
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:50,926
Now I've laughed enough!

1633
01:28:51,014 --> 01:28:51,763
Do you hear me?

1634
01:28:51,851 --> 01:28:52,700
You've made a fool of me!

1635
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:56,908
Carlos was arrested.

1636
01:29:02,531 --> 01:29:03,562
Now tell me what happened.

1637
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:07,697
Shall I break your neck to refresh your memory?

1638
01:29:07,862 --> 01:29:08,665
No, Pepe.

1639
01:29:10,162 --> 01:29:11,263
Slimane planned it all.

1640
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:11,758
Yeah?

1641
01:29:11,758 --> 01:29:12,924
He told me to come for you.

1642
01:29:12,924 --> 01:29:14,683
- Go on. 
 - He thinks you'll come down.

1643
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:15,135
- Then?

1644
01:29:15,135 --> 01:29:16,795
The hotel is surrounded, they're waiting.

1645
01:29:16,889 --> 01:29:18,071
Did you see the girl?

1646
01:29:18,215 --> 01:29:18,800
No.

1647
01:29:18,866 --> 01:29:20,274
Why didn't she come up yesterday?

1648
01:29:20,274 --> 01:29:21,815
He told her you'd been killed.

1649
01:29:25,758 --> 01:29:28,652
Slimane planned the whole thing.

1650
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,370
Is that all?

1651
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:31,390
Yes.

1652
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:33,250
Thanks.

1653
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:48,263
You can't do it, Pepe.

1654
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:50,534
You can't leave me. What have I done?

1655
01:29:51,577 --> 01:29:53,765
It has nothing to do with you, Ines.

1656
01:29:54,048 --> 01:29:56,593
You're a good kid, but this can't be helped.

1657
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:58,030
It's not your fault.

1658
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:01,557
I won't let you do it. I won't let you. You'll be killed.

1659
01:30:01,636 --> 01:30:02,745
Blame it on the Casbah.

1660
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:06,064
It's for her. You don't care about anything else, so you're throwing away your life.

1661
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:07,145
But it's my own life.

1662
01:30:07,145 --> 01:30:10,571
Don't do it, Pepe. Don't go. Listen to me.

1663
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:11,483
Pepe.

1664
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:54,150
Wait.

1665
01:32:47,956 --> 01:32:49,584
We didn't expect you.

1666
01:32:49,657 --> 01:32:51,216
He's not coming here.

1667
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,923
He's gone to the boat.

1668
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:54,872
You expect me to believe that?

1669
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:56,885
He is going away with her.

1670
01:32:59,858 --> 01:33:01,722
So you're the one to betray him.

1671
01:33:02,318 --> 01:33:03,767
You couldn't wait to run to me.

1672
01:33:04,411 --> 01:33:08,890
You call it love, but it means you'd kill him before you'd let him go free. That's what you've done.

1673
01:33:09,123 --> 01:33:11,702
Sure as if you'd held a gun in your hands.

1674
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,814
I couldn't let him go.

1675
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:15,645
I couldn't lose him.

1676
01:33:17,763 --> 01:33:20,830
I thought I'd figured all the moves, but I miscalculated.

1677
01:33:22,057 --> 01:33:23,304
I didn't think of you.

1678
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:24,388
That's just fine.

1679
01:33:26,329 --> 01:33:29,108
In a few more minutes, it might have been put of our hands.

1680
01:33:30,594 --> 01:33:31,439
Don't go.

1681
01:33:31,441 --> 01:33:32,801
-Give him a chance.
-I did.

1682
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:34,814
But you knew. You planned it this way.

1683
01:33:34,814 --> 01:33:36,941
So he'd walk into a trap. And he's done it

1684
01:33:37,081 --> 01:33:37,983
with your help.

1685
01:33:38,055 --> 01:33:38,653
Come on.

1686
01:34:39,213 --> 01:34:42,182
You know, the pleasant thing about travelling is going back home.

1687
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:44,606
It's like going away again.

1688
01:34:44,606 --> 01:34:47,121
Oh I had a good time. Didn't you, Andre?

1689
01:34:47,568 --> 01:34:48,278
Me?

1690
01:34:50,097 --> 01:34:53,257
I never laughed so much in my life.

1691
01:35:06,937 --> 01:35:07,940
You see, Pepe,

1692
01:35:08,593 --> 01:35:10,902
we meet at the appointed time.

1693
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:13,340
Tell the truth.

1694
01:35:13,436 --> 01:35:15,207
I almost missed the appointment.

1695
01:35:19,257 --> 01:35:20,086
Not here.

1696
01:35:20,808 --> 01:35:21,455
As you wish.

1697
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:24,892
I can't refuse an old friend.

1698
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,604
All aboard who goes on board.

1699
01:36:25,323 --> 01:36:27,178
Let me wait here until it leaves.

1700
01:36:28,397 --> 01:36:29,768
It's not much to ask.

1701
01:36:31,858 --> 01:36:33,068
I can't get away.

1702
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,763
I know I can trust you.

1703
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,540
Gaby.

1704
01:37:38,017 --> 01:37:39,485
Gaby.

1705
01:37:40,546 --> 01:37:42,240
Gaby.

1706
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:44,082
Gaby.

1707
01:37:44,976 --> 01:37:46,052
Gaby.

1708
01:37:53,938 --> 01:37:55,155
Gaby.

1709
01:37:59,179 --> 01:38:00,348
I'm sorry, Pepe.

1710
01:38:00,889 --> 01:38:02,877
He thought you were going to escape.

1711
01:38:05,098 --> 01:38:06,787
And

1712
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:08,770
so I have,

1713
01:38:10,285 --> 01:38:11,557
my friend.
