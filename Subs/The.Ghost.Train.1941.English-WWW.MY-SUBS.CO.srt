-== [ www.MY-SUBS.org ] ==-

2
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:19,873
Look! That's ours.
A tasteful three-piece bedroom suite,

3
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,581
with figured walnuts.
That's right.

4
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:26,904
Just think, day after tomorrow we'll be
waking up in bed.

5
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:30,848
Herbert!
Well, we're getting married, aren't we?

6
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:34,148
I can't get over that man in the shop.
Wasn't he nice?

7
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:37,560
Fancy giving us that lovely
fender fireiron and coal-scuttle.

8
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:39,050
I hope he doesn't get into trouble.

9
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:42,140
What's the good of them?
We've got gas fire.

10
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,605
Tickets please.

11
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,615
What time do we get into Truro?

12
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:50,558
You're due at half past ten.
Change at Falvale Junction.

13
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:52,715
Herbert? Half past ten.

14
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:54,907
Thank you.

15
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,294
I said we should have caught
that earlier train.

16
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:02,384
That furniture chap would keep on talking.

17
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:05,272
We shall cop it from her.

18
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,696
Now then, my lad.
This is a railway carriage,
not a playground.

19
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:12,584
Go on. Off with you.

20
00:02:15,473 --> 00:02:18,203
This is a nonsmoker.
Tickets please.

21
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,497
Oh tickets.
What, again?

22
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:22,095
I haven't seen your ticket yet, madam.

23
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:25,095
Well if you haven't,
everyone else on your railway has.

24
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,167
Hush, Polly.

25
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,087
I've had to show it at
every station we've stopped at,

26
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,365
all the way from London.

27
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,350
I'm sorry, madam, but we have to
keep a check on travelers nowadays.

28
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,480
Well, perhaps you think
I'm a parachutist!

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,291
Perhaps you would like
to look at those parcels.

30
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,889
See if I've got a rifle
or a machine gun!

31
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,234
I only want to see your ticket, madam.

32
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:45,217
Here's my ticket...

33
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:48,413
and here's my identification card
and here's my ration book.

34
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:51,504
And if you want my birth certificate,
you'll have to ask Somerset House for it.

35
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,101
Truro. Thank you, madam.

36
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:55,446
Change at Falvale Junction.
It's the next stop.

37
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:57,437
You won't see the name on the station.

38
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,581
Took a bit of a chance putting it on the ticket,
didn't they?

39
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,831
Hey!
You!

40
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,917
Yeah you!
It's all right. You can go now. I got it.

41
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,048
What do you think you're up to?
Well, I lost me tipper.

42
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,646
You can't do that.
Can't do what?

43
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:44,244
Stop the train just to pick up your hat.

44
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:45,842
Well, I stopped it.
Don't be silly.

45
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:50,952
Here, tell you what I'll do.
There you are. I started it again.

46
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,813
Give me that!
All right. Give me a buck up.

47
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,108
I wish you'd cut your nails.

48
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,814
Oh, hello.

49
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:11,008
That chap's got a nerve,
dropping his hat out.

50
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:16,711
I say, what's happened?
She's smiling.

51
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:19,832
What? Eh?
I mean the train. Why did it stop?

52
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:22,380
Oh, some fool's hat fell off.
He pulled the cord.

53
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:25,944
Oh, bless my soul.
Good gracious.

54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,619
Come back here!
I want your name and address.

55
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,395
Here now.
What's all the trouble?

56
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,633
No trouble at all.
I've got it now. Thank you.

57
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:44,977
Pulled the communication cord
and stopped the train to get his hat!

58
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,042
Did you get his name and address?

59
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,338
Thatâ€™s what I'm trying to get.

60
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:50,542
Now sir...
Now where the...?

61
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:55,643
Come on!
Out of there!

62
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,082
Come on...
Come...!

63
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,960
Hello. You still here?
I was having a wipe.

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,557
This pop-pop's filthy.

65
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:04,475
Now sir...
All right. I'll handle this.

66
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,434
Thank you.

67
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,844
Are you going to give me your name
and address or are you not?

68
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,549
My name and address...
Well, uh..

69
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,787
Actually, I'm travelling incog...

70
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:16,303
But that's me, Tommy Gander,
comedian and entertainer.

71
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:18,007
Now what's the address?

72
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,884
For the next 16 weeks,
I'll be at the Pier Pavilion, New Key.

73
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:22,588
16 weeks.
Yes.

74
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,400
Well, we'll see how I go on Monday night.

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,957
You know, this will mean
a prosecution of 5-5-5, sir.

76
00:05:26,957 --> 00:05:30,845
What for? I can't understand
what all this fuss is about!

77
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,096
You've stopped the train.
Well, it was only a little stop.

78
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,199
Besides, nobody minded.

79
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:39,103
Did any one here mind me
stopping the train for a few minutes?

80
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,880
"No."

81
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:42,300
We'll try another one...

82
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,578
Did anybody here...

83
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,709
Now look here, you better get
back to your compartment.

84
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,800
This is my compartment.
Thanks ever so for seeing me home.

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,799
Sir, if you wouldn't behave like this, I ...

86
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,897
You know, I don't think
this was your carriage.

87
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,495
Wasn't it?

88
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,159
Trouble is, they all look so much alike.

89
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:04,250
If one only had a different
color scheme in each compartment,

90
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,659
one could tell which was
one's own compartment.

91
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,470
Excuse me,
is this gentleman annoying you?

92
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,494
Who? Me?
I wasn't talking to you, little man.

93
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:12,986
Anyway, this is a first-class carriage.

94
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,543
Well what about it?
Well I bet you bill a third-class ticket.

95
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,313
I have not!
I've got a platform ticket.

96
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:19,874
Is he a friend of yours?

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,255
I never saw either of you
before in my life.

98
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,386
As I thought!
You don't even know the lady.

99
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:27,583
You forced your way into her compartment
and caused everyone a lot of annoyance.

100
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,353
Now run along to your own carriage
before I call the guard.

101
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:33,336
Here, let's be fair. After all,
this isn't your carriage EYE-ther.

102
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,366
EE-ther! ... EYE-ther! ...  EE-ther!

103
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,812
Let's ask the lady.
It's a good idea.

104
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:41,922
Is it EYE-ther or EE-ther?
N-EYE-ther! ... N-EE-ther!

105
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,737
What's this?
Good afternoon.

106
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,292
Who are these people?
I haven't the slightest idea!

107
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:51,023
Is your name Winthrop?
Yes.

108
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,475
R.G. Winthrop?
Yes.

109
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,818
In that case, this is your bag.

110
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:59,441
Oh, and here's your coat.
And here's your scarf.

111
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,998
And here's your book.
Oh we mustn't lose the place.

112
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:04,775
There you are.
What are you two playing at?

113
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:10,310
One moment.
Winthrop, R.G.

114
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,866
Aren't you the all-rounder
that played to the MCC?

115
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,996
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am!

116
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:18,253
Oh isn't that wonderful.
I only need you to complete my set.

117
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:21,603
Set?
Yes, cigarette cards. 50 famous cricketers.

118
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:22,988
What are you two doing in here?

119
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,373
Well, he lost his hat.

120
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:26,718
Oh, so you're the idiot
who stopped the train.

121
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,955
Yes, I don't know my own strength!

122
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:31,512
My time happens to be valuable,
even if yours isn't.

123
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,495
Now perhaps you'll be good enough to move
out of here before I lose my temper.

124
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,732
Oh yes.
One minute...

125
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:39,504
If I remember rightly,
you were a boxing blow as well.

126
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,167
Yes, I was!

127
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:46,323
You mean you used to fight....
knock down...  all the...

128
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,879
Oh, well, circumstances alter cases.

129
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,183
Good bye all.
Good bye.

130
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:55,486
We'd better be getting our things together.
We'll soon be at Falvale.

131
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,469
Oh you're changing at Falvale?
So am I. Is that a coincidence?

132
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,706
Are you going to New Key?
No we are not!

133
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:02,731
Oh. Well if you do,
must come and see me.

134
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,116
I'm in the concert party there.

135
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,887
My name's Tommy Gander,
and if you give that to the manager,

136
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,378
he'll give you a row seats to yourself.

137
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:10,508
Are you going to get out?
Or do I have to throw you out?

138
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,107
Oh Richard, does this...
Leave this to me!

139
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:14,550
Get out!
And stay out!

140
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,631
I don't like strange men trying to
scrape up an acquaintance with you.

141
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:24,185
Oh don't be silly, Richard.
You sound like something out of East Men!

142
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:38,318
Pick up my hat.
Cause of all the trouble.

143
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,094
Uh hmm!

144
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,855
See you at Falvale.

145
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,909
Oh, go away!

146
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:38,505
Falvale.
Train for Truro.

147
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,807
Falvale. Train for Truro.
Wake up! Look alive!

148
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,430
Well ever the fun thinks,
the worst of the journey's over now.

149
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,414
Yes I know, but half past ten!

150
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,191
What's she going to say to that?
I'd like to know.

151
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,684
I'll take the lady's bag...
...keep them all together...

152
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:59,708
...You take that one...
...uh, I'll take...

153
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,198
Can I have...

154
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,822
I'll show the lady!
Here! What do you think you're doing?

155
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,739
Okay.
Excuse me!

156
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,977
When the connection arrives,
it's sure to be crowded.

157
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:11,428
Wouldn't it be a good idea if
you were to come in my compartment...

158
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,492
...you and your brother?

159
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:14,517
The lady and her brother
are traveling first-class.

160
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:17,607
Besides, he doesn't like you.
Oh, a lot of people don't like me at first.

161
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:19,524
But you'd be surprised how
I grow on one.

162
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,230
Even your brother might learn to care.

163
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,574
Yes, I'm sure he would.
But he's not my brother!

164
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:26,558
Oh...
I know, he's your father!

165
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:28,475
I say, are these fellows
annoying you again?

166
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:31,111
Good afternoon.
Sorry, Dad!

167
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,473
Cheek!

168
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:41,689
Guard! Guard!
Open this door at once!

169
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,712
Oh, I'm locked in!

170
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:47,655
The door's further along, madam.
That's just a window!

171
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:50,542
Oh, thank you.
The idea!

172
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,120
Allow me, madam.
Can I take your parcels?

173
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,529
I'll take the aviary.
Thank you.

174
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,816
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8...

175
00:12:08,815 --> 00:12:11,521
And my dust mask.
Thank you.

176
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,185
I'm going to see my decorated leases,
you know.

177
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,635
How nice.
And staying on one of those farms.

178
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,564
I'm taking them bacterinates from London
in case they can't get them down there.

179
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:23,882
Like rhinos. Very nice.
Have some?

180
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:27,880
Well that's Polly's!   So...
He won't mind, will she?

181
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:33,101
Oh! Hey, wait a minute!
I've left my basket in the guard van.

182
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:40,076
Hey! I want my basket. It's in the van.
No it isn't. I threw it out on the platform.

183
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:42,420
Threw it out?
You'll be hearing from my solicitor.

184
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,018
You'll be hearing from the company!

185
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,509
I'll tell my mum of you!

186
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,508
Ah choo...
Ah guh chuh!

187
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:59,788
Dead and alive for the whole of this.
Where is everybody?

188
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,454
Hello!

189
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,631
Hello!
Hello!

190
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,630
Anybody?

191
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:16,930
Porter?

192
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,532
Anybody home?

193
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,093
There's no one around there.
Here's someone.

194
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:33,921
Ah, about time too!

195
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,611
When does our connection for Truro come in?

196
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:39,636
Come in?
It be gone quarter of an hour ago!

197
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:42,194
Oh blast! When's the next one?
There aren't no next.

198
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,324
There's no more trains through here tonight.

199
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,029
I be just going to lockup

200
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,399
Oh, ah Porter,
when's the Truro train coming?

201
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:54,234
Just in about nine hours, ma'am.
What?

202
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,217
I'm afraid our train was too late.
The connection went without us.

203
00:13:57,217 --> 00:13:58,945
And do you know why it was so late?

204
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:02,651
Our comic friend with his comic hat!
Oh!

205
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,888
Hey you!
What's his confounded name?

206
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:08,665
Mr. Gander.
Gander, come here!

207
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,731
Most intelligent basket, that!
You know, it seems to know me.

208
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,329
Whenever I go near it,
it creaks.

209
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,714
As you got us into this mess,

210
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,632
perhaps you can think of some way
of getting us out of it.

211
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,018
Out of what?

212
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,149
Owing to your idiocy,
we've missed the connection!

213
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,346
Yes! And what's more,
there's no train for nine hours!

214
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,475
Nine hours.
That'll be tomorrow, won't it.

215
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,140
I've got to rehearse at New Key
at half past ten.

216
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,164
You should have thought of that
before you stopped the train.

217
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:35,681
Oh, I know.
We charter a special.

218
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,598
Special indeed!
And who's gonna pay for that?

219
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,251
Well, they can take it
out of the money I owe them.

220
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,647
In for a fiver, in for a special!
That's me!

221
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,057
Excuse me old man, you...
You'll get no specials here.

222
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:46,548
I could drop the form 6-4...

223
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:49,319
You mean to tell me we can't
get to Truro tonight?

224
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,555
Aye.
Leastways not by train.

225
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,113
Doesn't bear thinking about,
does it, Herbert?

226
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:55,284
Drive?

227
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:58,268
I suppose that applies
to Red Roofs too, eh?

228
00:14:58,268 --> 00:15:00,506
No more trains tonight!
Nowhere!

229
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:04,838
But I'm expected at Red Roofs.
I promised Dr. Hariby...

230
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:09,243
Well of all the quaint places...
Oh, hello.

231
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,353
Where does that line
on the other side go to?

232
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,487
It don't go nowhere.
Oh, it don't go nowhere.

233
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:20,376
He means it stays where it is!
Ha ha ha!

234
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,823
Hello...
Oh lovely!

235
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,700
This is real concert party weather!
This will send them in.

236
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:34,496
Good gracious!
Can't stand here and get soaked, eh?

237
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:37,494
He could stand anywhere
and get soaked!

238
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:43,684
Pardon me...

239
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:57,616
Cozy little place, isn't it?

240
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:01,171
Well, if this is the Cornish Riviera,
give me Camberwell.

241
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:03,669
It's gloomy, isn't it?

242
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,607
So this is the Ritz-Carlton!
Oh, allow me.

243
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:21,163
There you are.
What the devil are you doing?

244
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:23,507
I was putting it on!
Oh.

245
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:25,951
Young man, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

246
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:30,860
Am I popular!
Hello, Polly! Polly!

247
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:34,375
Will you talk to me?
Polly. Polly Wantamore.

248
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:38,956
No? Sketch a Poll. Pretty Poll.
There's a Polly.

249
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,768
There's a lovely girl.

250
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:43,325
Are you one of the parrots
of Wimpole Street?

251
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,562
Oh, don't do that!
Not with company about!

252
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:47,907
There she is!
There's a girl.

253
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,465
I say, I wonder if I could
teach you to talk?

254
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:52,062
I wonder if you could say Heil Hitler?

255
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:55,151
Eh? No.
Not with a beak like that.

256
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,150
Don't listen to him, Polly.

257
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:01,546
You ladies and gentlemen be ready?
I'd like to lock up now.

258
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:03,675
Lock up?
You're not going to turn us out in this!

259
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:07,193
No! Why should I catch old-monia?
I've had new-monia, you know!

260
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,004
Ha ha. Ha ha.
That was witty!

261
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,708
You can't stay here!

262
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,484
No? Well I'm going to surprise you
for a start.

263
00:17:17,314 --> 00:17:18,805
We're all staying!

264
00:17:18,806 --> 00:17:21,257
The railway company has taken our money
and it's got to play the game!

265
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,961
Yes! Even on a sticky wicket!

266
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:26,158
But Richard, if there aren't any more trains...
then he'll have to get us a bus or something!

267
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,329
That's right! Give me a number 6.

268
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,501
I've got some friends who live in Hackney.

269
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:30,207
All fares ready. No standing on top.

270
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,764
Oh shut up!
I'm not traveling in any bus.

271
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:34,788
I paid to go all the way by train.

272
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,344
Besides, Polly hates the smell of petrol.

273
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:41,443
Pretty Polly, don't you?
There must be some way, hmm?

274
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:44,164
Dr. Hariby of Red Roofs is expecting me.

275
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:47,467
I'm going there as his locum.
And he's leaving on holiday tonight.

276
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,663
You see, you must do something.
We've got to get there tonight,
haven't we, Herbert?

277
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:54,713
That's right. For one thing,
the ceremony is in the morning.

278
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:58,335
Ceremony?
Oh, you mean a family bereavement?

279
00:17:58,335 --> 00:18:02,811
Oh no. Herbert means we're getting married.
That's right.

280
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,433
Oh! Cut myself a piece of wedding cake!
Isn't that marvelous.

281
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,416
I must kiss the bride!
Oh, wrong lady. Excuse me.

282
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,440
Speech! Speech!
Must have a speech.

283
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,104
I hope you'll be very happy.
So do I.     Same here.

284
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,195
First the girl and then the boy...
Oh be quiet.

285
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:20,178
Look, this isn't much of a place
to spend your last bachelor hours.

286
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:21,776
Oh I don't know.
I've slept in worse.

287
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,800
You ought to see my Anderson shelter.

288
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,078
I think I better get down.

289
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,423
Cover the latest talk with a nice cup of tea.

290
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:30,406
Shut up there, auntie.
Good night all.

291
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:33,069
There'll be no sleeping here.

292
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,733
The last train's gone,
and I gotta lock up.

293
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:38,398
You can't stay here.
I've had enough of this nonsense!

294
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:40,209
The least you can do is to ring up a garage

295
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,446
and get us some sort of
a conveyance to the nearest village.

296
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,044
And we are staying here until you do!

297
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:47,453
Yes sir. Surely there must
be a hostelry somewhere.

298
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,585
He means a boozer!

299
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:54,807
All right. I'll try.
It won't be no good, I tell you!

300
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:55,764
I'll come with you.

301
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:57,653
Passengers must cross by the footbridge.

302
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:01,305
You stay where you are!
You're a menace!

303
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:03,542
And the next time you drop
your hat out of the window,

304
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,353
I hope you forget to take it off!

305
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,575
You will rue every word you said!

306
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,747
Unfrocked!

307
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:19,739
â™ª La la la la dee dee dee dee ha â™ª

308
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:22,515
I wonder if it stopped raining?
I'll have a look.

309
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,250
Ooh!
What is it?

310
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:32,406
My basket!

311
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,396
Half-wit!

312
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,606
Edna, you know what this means,
don't you?

313
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:48,294
We'll have to be together all night.
Yes, Herbert.

314
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:54,794
Before we're married, right?
There is six other people with us, Herbert.

315
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,482
She wouldn't believe it,
not if we said there was sixty.

316
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:04,062
Would she?
No, Herbert.

317
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:08,432
Edna, who's going to face her in the morning?
You, Herbert.

318
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:12,693
But why should I?
After all, she's your mother.

319
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:16,470
She'll be your mother too,
tomorrow night, Herbert.

320
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,986
That's right.

321
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:22,282
Hello.
This be Saul Hodgkin up at station.

322
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:24,856
I got eight passengers here.

323
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:27,716
Yes, they missed the Truro connection.

324
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:29,953
Oh I know, but what
am I going to do with them?

325
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:31,871
They want you to send a bus for them.

326
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,870
Yes but...
Hello...

327
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,569
Well, what's the verdict?
Do we get a bus?

328
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:43,058
I said it wouldn't be no good.

329
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,657
But I tell you what,

330
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:48,600
if you would all walk across to Falvillage,
might be they'd put you up at the pub.

331
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,649
Splendid day! I always say there
are worst places than pubs, eh?

332
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:54,886
Why didn't you tell us that before?

333
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,590
It's all right people.
I fixed everything.

334
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,721
There's no bus,
but if we walk down to Falvillage,

335
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,533
they'll wine us and dine us
and put us to bed.

336
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,643
Oh good!
Lovely!

337
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,462
It's worth a dash through the rain
for a night's rest.

338
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,778
Just a minute,
How far is this village?

339
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:11,295
Oh it's about... um...  I don't know.
How far is it?

340
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:16,560
Oh, if you walk across the fields,
there's only four short miles.

341
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,818
Four short what?!
Four miles - in this?

342
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:23,868
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it!
Are we in the middle of a moat?

343
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,530
Surely there's some place nearer
than Falvillage.

344
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,196
That be the only place
within ten mile of here.

345
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:33,378
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Come on! Give me a hand with it.

346
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:38,570
I forgot all about my tisket-a-tasket.

347
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:41,235
I do hope my tutu's not ruined.

348
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:43,365
Now donâ€™t do that!
You'll have puddles all over the floor.

349
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:45,176
Well, I'm soaking wet.
I've got to change.

350
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:47,307
Here's another thing you can't do:
you can't change here.

351
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,652
Well that's a funny thing.
The guard said we must all change here.

352
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:54,206
Oh, go and change in the ticket office.
All right. Come on, you basket.

353
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:02,215
Don't be you long.
No peeping!

354
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:06,379
Well, we're gonna stay here all night,
so we might as well make ourselves comfortable.

355
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:10,641
Thank you.
Don't you lite that fire.

356
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:14,585
Now listen, my good man, you've said your peace,
so jump on your bicycle and pedal off!

357
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:20,019
I got my orders and I got to obey 'em.
You can't stay here!

358
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:23,641
And uh, who's going to stop us?
I be!

359
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:27,583
What are you gonna do? Throw us out?
Well, I suppose I'll have to.

360
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:30,459
In that case, you can start on me.
And me!

361
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,550
Don't you lay your hands on me!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

362
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,533
I do wish you'd hush!
Polly wants to go to bed.

363
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:39,197
We are staying here whether you
like it or not, understand?

364
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:42,926
I can't leave the station
with you people here!

365
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:45,696
Then you'll have to stay here with us.
No! That I won't!

366
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,040
Why? What's the matter with it?
Apart from everything?

367
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,706
Anyone would think from the way you're going on,
the place was haunted!

368
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:57,204
It is haunted!
Oh my god!

369
00:22:57,204 --> 00:23:02,870
Oh, Herbert!
Oooo...

370
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,640
My next, Napoleon!

371
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:25,972
Haunted? What are you trying to do?
Scare us out of here?

372
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:30,660
It be haunted, all right! You won't find
any in these parts that would stay here!

373
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,324
Especially tonight.

374
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:37,211
Well, as we've decided to stay the night,
you'd better let us know what to expect.

375
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,593
There's no story for ladies here.
Well off that, we've got to hear it.

376
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:45,576
Yeah, come on. Spill it!
We want something to entertain us!

377
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:50,464
Entertain ya? Powers above!
Oh come on! Do tell us!

378
00:23:56,762 --> 00:24:02,092
Very well. But I warned you.
There's no pretty story.

379
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:05,201
Maybe when you've heard it,
you'll change your mind about staying!

380
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,791
Will you keep that confounded bird quiet?!

381
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:14,238
It was the time of the diamond jubilee.
43 year ago this very night!

382
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:18,818
In them days, the stationmaster here
was a man by the name of Ted Holmes.

383
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:22,336
You was asking about the
old line it runs on the other side.

384
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,253
You mean the one that don't go no where.

385
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:26,915
Aye, but in them days,
the trains used to run on it.

386
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:29,367
Through yonder short tunnel
down to the old port.

387
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,097
The other side of the tunnel,
the line bridges the river.

388
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:37,873
It be a swing bridge worked by a
lever wheel out there on the platform.

389
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,129
This was the bridge.

390
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,604
In '97 it was always left open for
the Claire boats to go out on the tide.

391
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:47,053
And they closed it when
the trains were to come.

392
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:53,720
But no train ever runs over that bridge now.
And it bent been closed for 43 years.

393
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:55,897
And the day I be telling you about,

394
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:59,308
a party of some plants folk went
to a bean feast up at Truro.

395
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:02,078
And they chartered a special to
take 'em home late that night.

396
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:04,316
Ben Isaacs was the driver of that special.

397
00:25:04,316 --> 00:25:07,938
But Ted Homes was kept on late duty here
to close the bridge.

398
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:11,454
He was a sick man,
but no one knew it at the time.

399
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:16,569
When they phoned through here
from Truro wanting Ted to close it
as the special was starting off,

400
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:20,510
Ted answers that he would go
and shut the bridge that moment.

401
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,667
But them were the last words
he was ever heard to speak.

402
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,436
Well, what happened?

403
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:33,404
It was striking 11 o'clock when he
lit his lamp and went out on the platform.

404
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:39,958
He reached the bridge wheel,
and as he tried to turn it...

405
00:25:40,908 --> 00:25:45,303
Then the illness come on him.

406
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,640
But yet something must have told him
it was all up with him.

407
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,115
But he gathered up his strength and
struggled back towards the waiting room.

408
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:56,524
His one thought was to get to that phone
and stop the train from coming.

409
00:25:56,524 --> 00:25:59,294
But he never reached it!

410
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:05,902
He falls down there, dead,
with his lamp still burning in his hand!

411
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:09,630
The special was dead on time.
The signals were with it.

412
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,400
And it were a coming along fast
with the bridge wide open!

413
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,287
And Ted Holmes lying there dead!

414
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:18,046
It seemed as though when he
were just about the station,

415
00:26:18,046 --> 00:26:21,350
something warned Ben Isaacs a danger,
but he claps on his brakes.

416
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,358
And the train went up tearing through
the station here with all the brakes on
and the whistle screaming!

417
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:30,513
It were no use!
The train was a thundering through the tunnel

418
00:26:30,513 --> 00:26:34,846
straight through the open bridge into the river!
Crash!

419
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:39,752
Horrible!
Oh Herbert!

420
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:45,110
I warned ya it weren't no pretty story
ye was making me tell.

421
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,093
Yes, but where does the haunting come in?

422
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:51,290
Some nights the signal bell rings!

423
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,404
And a train comes screaming and a tearing
through the station with its whistle blowing!

424
00:26:56,403 --> 00:26:58,535
Probably a goods train.

425
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:02,691
I tell you there ain't no trains run on these metals
from 10:00 at night till 7:00 in the morning!

426
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,526
Besides, whatever it is,

427
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:11,853
it never starts from Truro
and it never runs into St. Lannes.

428
00:27:11,852 --> 00:27:14,592
If it be a natural thing,

429
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:18,621
where do it come from?
Where do it go?

430
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:24,959
Have you ever seen it?

431
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,089
I shouldn't be here if I had!

432
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:32,422
They do say, as to look on the ghost train,
do mean death!

433
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:42,327
You can stop here if you like, but not me!
I got a wife and children looking to me!

434
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,284
Do you mean you're afraid?

435
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,842
Afraid? I am afraid.
I bear the shame to own it!

436
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:48,506
Well, we're not!
Very well.

437
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,727
Seeing you've made up your mind to it.

438
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:59,030
But if ye do hear a train, for god's sake,
don't you go running out to look at it!

439
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,915
Good night to you all.

440
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:09,025
Good night, ol' boy.
Thanks for the bedtime story.

441
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:15,251
Cheerful bloke!
Oh! I'm glad he's gone!

442
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,020
Me hands have all come out
in a perspiration.

443
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:21,430
Ghost train! Ha!

444
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,872
Never heard such nonsense
in all my life!

445
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:29,741
That railway accident did take place, you know.
Yes, possibly.

446
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,511
But all that nonsense about the
sight of a train having killed people,

447
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,854
surely as a medical man,
you don't believe that!

448
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:36,346
Of course he doesn't!

449
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:41,355
Young lady, I expect you think
I'm just an old-fashioned GP.

450
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:44,871
Nowadays if these specialists
don't understand something,

451
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:48,280
they chatter about inhibitions
and split personalities.

452
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,944
I prefer the immortal William.

453
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:57,657
"There are more things in heaven and earth..."
Ah, he knew a thing or two, eh?

454
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:01,599
You don't think there's anything in
what he said, do you Herbert?

455
00:29:01,598 --> 00:29:03,302
Of course not.

456
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:04,999
All chains, come along please.

457
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,671
Any more for Jews, freewinds,
refers, real friendly.
Gaww...

458
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:09,269
Who will have a ticket for the ghost train?

459
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,639
Guaranteed haunted in every bogie.
Whoo!

460
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:16,559
Will you shut up!
Shut up? Very good, sir.

461
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,006
Pipe please.

462
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:21,523
If this be a natural thing...

463
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:25,785
Where do it come from?
Where do it go?

464
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:29,407
To think, we've got to put up with that
little squirt for the next 8 hours!

465
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:31,112
An alarming thought, eh?

466
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,883
Do you play chess by any chance, doctor?

467
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:38,145
Chess? Yes yes. I have played.
I'm afraid I'm a bit rusty now though.

468
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:41,873
Well, it's hardly my game of course.
But it helps to pass the time away.

469
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:43,778
Yes, I never sit here.

470
00:29:43,812 --> 00:29:45,345
Splendid!

471
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,674
Here we are, playmates.
Never a dull moment.

472
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:06,593
Gander to the rescue.
He's a scream!

473
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:07,977
Now never mind about the ghost tale.

474
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:09,469
What you want is a bit of music
to cheer you up.

475
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,920
And here's a little song I want to sing
at New Key this summer.

476
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,121
It'll paralyze them.

477
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:24,386
â™ª Once at the seaside, feeling very restless.
I ran down tuppence and I rolled on the pier â™ª

478
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:28,328
â™ª Hadn't gone far when the strains of music
Wafted on the breeze and landed in my ear â™ª

479
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:32,272
â™ª I quickened up me steps for I love nice noises
Very soon arrived right opposite the band â™ª

480
00:30:32,272 --> 00:30:36,321
â™ª Saw the conductor on a lemonade box
With his little baton stuck up in his right hand â™ª

481
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,262
â™ª One two three four, off went the cornet
Five six seven eight, the fiddles followed too â™ª

482
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:44,205
â™ª A man in the corner playing on the piccolo
Keeping time with the sole of his boot â™ª

483
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:48,041
â™ª Right behind him was a fellow with the trombone
Blowing like the devil with his cheeks out wide â™ª

484
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,195
â™ª Working so hard that both his little eyeballs
Left their sockets and stood outside â™ª

485
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:55,924
â™ª Hanging on a rostrum, a drummer, very lonely
Drums all round like bees in a swarm â™ª

486
00:30:55,924 --> 00:30:59,760
â™ª Looking very cold with his nose quite scarlet
Banging on the cymbals to keep himself warm â™ª

487
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,702
â™ª Opposite to him was the man with the toupee
Spitting down a reed - what a nasty man! â™ª

488
00:31:03,702 --> 00:31:07,643
â™ª Sitting next to him was a fellow with a French horn
Full of soul and bitter beer, tuppence on the can â™ª

489
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:11,480
â™ª Fellow with a cello, boom boom boom boom
Trying very hard to saw it in two â™ª

490
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,316
â™ª His pal with the double bass, cuddling it fondly
Looking like a camel with a dose of the flu â™ª

491
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:19,151
â™ª Man with a piccolo, fed up with the dancing
Sick and tired of hearing the same old toot â™ª

492
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:22,881
â™ª Thought he'd like a change so he put it down beside him
And then started messing with a full size flute â™ª

493
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,929
â™ª Man with the bassoon, nothing on his music
Acted like a mute, never said a word â™ª

494
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:35,152
â™ª Just as I thought he was going to fall asleep
He picked up his bassoon and gave us all the bird â™ª

495
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,903
Why you little...  I'll knock...
Richard! Richard! Richard!

496
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:05,179
After all, you started it.

497
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,165
Yes, yes. We don't want anymore
unpleasantness, do we, huh?

498
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:09,655
Well I've had just about enough of him!

499
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:12,877
I was only trying to cheer things up.
Well don't!

500
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:19,139
So you don't want me to entertain you, eh?
No!

501
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:22,915
No good? Napoleon?

502
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:46,521
I heard something!
In there!

503
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,718
In where?
The refreshment room?

504
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:53,234
I'll go and see.
I'll attend to this!

505
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:55,232
Yes certainly.
You go first.

506
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,766
Oh help help ooh!
Oohh let me go!

507
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:09,429
Oh he's got me!
Help! Let me go! Help!

508
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:14,330
Oh help help!
Ah ha ha!

509
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:20,937
Ah ha ha ha....
No good? Napoleon...  No good...

510
00:33:20,936 --> 00:33:23,713
It's all right, everyone.
There's not a thing.

511
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:27,436
Look!
What is it now?

512
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:31,272
You've got a packet of tea in your hand!
What's the matter with it?

513
00:33:31,272 --> 00:33:33,402
It's tea!
Of course it's tea, you silly little man.

514
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,430
That's no reason to go around
scaring the wits out...

515
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,410
Tea! What an idea! A cup of tea!
That's what I meant.

516
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,795
I suppose you haven't got a teapot
and a kettle

517
00:33:39,796 --> 00:33:41,394
and a few cups and saucers in there?
No, I haven't!

518
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,377
And you give me back my tea, please.
Ah, stingy!

519
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:47,148
Two weeks coupons there!
Now now. Don't be mean.

520
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,704
After all, there's a war on.
We're adapting the pool system.

521
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:52,049
Wait a minute.
I'll tell you what I'll do.

522
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,819
You give us your tea
and I'll give you a bacon, a sugar

523
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,737
and a couple of cooking checks
out of my ration book,

524
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:59,186
Eh? Go on.
Yes, go on.

525
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:05,154
Woo woo woo...
I don't mind you having just one teaspoonful.

526
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:08,457
Ah, Lady Norfeld.
Yeah, none for each and one for the pot.

527
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:10,481
Aren't you ashamed, both of you!

528
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,145
Oh I don't mind, dear.
I could do with a cup of tea myself.

529
00:34:13,145 --> 00:34:19,113
I've got a tin of milk too.
Oh oh, sorry Polly.

530
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:21,563
You do that again and I'll have you
boiled up with a few carrots.

531
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:22,840
In what are we gonna make the tea?

532
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:25,185
Well there's sure to be a tea urn
in the refreshment room.

533
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:27,740
The girl's not as dumb as she looks!
Come on.

534
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,553
Where are you going?

535
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:32,644
I'm going to make some tea,
if you don't mind.

536
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:35,307
It's all right, boys. Don't worry.
We can manage.

537
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,012
There you are.

538
00:34:37,012 --> 00:34:39,142
Should we make tea in the dark?
Or will you have gas?

539
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,809
Gas, thank you.
Certainly.

540
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,134
Now, lovely weather we're
having for this time of the day.

541
00:34:47,134 --> 00:34:47,986
What could I do for you?

542
00:34:47,987 --> 00:34:53,431
First of all, I want eight cups.
Eight cups.  ...  Good.

543
00:34:54,443 --> 00:35:01,094
What did you say? Eight cups?
Eight cups.  ...  Yes, uh...

544
00:35:01,092 --> 00:35:04,608
Will you have them with or without?
With or without what?

545
00:35:04,608 --> 00:35:06,845
Handles.
With, please.

546
00:35:06,845 --> 00:35:08,844
I was afraid of that.

547
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:13,771
I'm afraid we're a little short of handles.
It's been too rough for the boats to go out.

548
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:17,820
However, there you are: four cups
and four suck-ups.

549
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,762
Hello. I've been looking
all over the hotel for you.

550
00:35:21,762 --> 00:35:23,894
What do you want?
I've come to help you make the tea.

551
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:26,237
Well we don't want any help.
Good. What do I do?

552
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:29,860
There don't seem to be a tap here.
You can help us find some water.

553
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,031
Goody goody!

554
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:33,269
Wait a minute!
You can't go out in this rain.

555
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,040
Of course not!
No! You go!

556
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,597
Oh...
Do you mind?

557
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:41,261
No. My other suit will be dry
by the time I get back.

558
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:47,036
Big hearted Gander, that's me!
Hot water in number 14. ...  Oohh...

559
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:51,489
Of course if you insist on going.
She doesn't.

560
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,377
Oh. ...
Oh! Just the very thing!

561
00:35:59,796 --> 00:36:03,466
"It's a far far wetter thing I go to..."

562
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:33,562
Hear!
Guess what I found.

563
00:37:33,562 --> 00:37:34,946
I wouldn't misadvise.

564
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:38,144
The wheel that works the bridge. You know,
the one that old man nearly died of.

565
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:41,234
Oh can't you forget about that old man?
All right, old man!

566
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:44,111
That's true. There is a wheel.
Yes, just outside there.

567
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:46,454
That's a gruesome story, isn't it?

568
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:51,570
But what must it be, when the train comes
a screaming and a tearing through the station?

569
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,012
...With it's whiskers blowing 
and it's oranged steamer...
I said forget it!

570
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:01,836
What was I talking about?
Here, can I help you?

571
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:08,358
I know. Light the blue paper
and retire immediately.

572
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,919
All right, everybody!
Don't be alarmed!

573
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,474
That was the tear.
I just "tear"ned on the gas!

574
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,632
Oh, I'm gonna take that one out
of the joke book.

575
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:26,091
I'm afraid my stuff's too high class for them.
Hello! I see you got it to light.

576
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:28,008
Yes, we know how it works,
and we found the cups

577
00:38:28,008 --> 00:38:29,499
and we're doing very well.
Thank you very much.

578
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,992
All right.
I was only trying to be useful.

579
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,869
Wasn't I, miss? ah...
What did you say your name was?

580
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,319
The lady didn't say what her name was.
Well, I told her what my name was.

581
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:37,704
Well, that's no reason to come in here...

582
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:40,901
If it'll stop you two arguing,
it's Winthrop. Jackie Winthrop.

583
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,458
Winthrop!
Oh, the same as R.G. in there.

584
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:46,654
Well, he's not your brother
and he's not your father.

585
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:49,850
He can't be your sister, even if
he does play hockey for Hampshire.

586
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,408
Look here. Is this a cross-examination.
Oh I don't mind.

587
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:55,497
Well I do! This silly little man has done
nothing but force his attentions on you

588
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:56,882
ever since he lost his silly hat!

589
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:59,867
Well, I can't call her Miss Whats-Her-Name!
Besides, I was only trying to help.

590
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:05,533
Well go and help the people in the other room.
Go on.
Well I don't want to. Oh no.

591
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:10,202
He's your cousin.

592
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:14,571
And you're not...uumm...
No.

593
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,458
That's all I wanted to know.

594
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:22,242
I say, don't be so miserable.
Oh come on. Cheer up!

595
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:25,545
Don't do that!
Give me the palpitations!

596
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:28,954
I say, talking about ghosts...
We're not!

597
00:39:28,954 --> 00:39:29,913
But I am.

598
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:33,749
Talking about ghosts reminds me
of a story about Golders Green.

599
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,773
Do you know Golders Green?
The underground?

600
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,289
No, the crematorium.
Oh?

601
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:43,445
One day as they were pushing the bodies in...
Shut up!

602
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:47,174
Wait a minute...
as they were pushing the bodies in...

603
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:49,838
Will you shut up!?
Don't you see, you're frightening the ladies?

604
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,502
Don't be silly! You're enjoying it, aren't you?
No I'm not!

605
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:58,576
Oh, perhaps you'd rather I told you the story
about the man who had his tongue torn out.

606
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:02,463
No I wouldn't!
Oh, aren't you a difficult lot.

607
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:06,239
Tea break coming up!

608
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:09,762
Eight cups of tea.
What about Ted? Doesn't he get one?

609
00:40:09,762 --> 00:40:11,253
Ted?
Who's Ted?

610
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:13,918
Ted Hooolmes!
I bet he's a bit thirsty by now!

611
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:16,901
After all he's been lying here
these past 43 years!

612
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:19,031
That's not funny!
I know it's not funny.

613
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:22,228
How would you like to be lying there
with a lamp still burning in your hand?!

614
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:24,785
Will you...!
Oh come and help me lay the table.

615
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:26,451
Yes, all right.
Excuse me.

616
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,072
Thank you. Can we have this?
We'll give it back to you afterwards.

617
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,096
Now don't fuss.
There you are. Move please .

618
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:36,292
There you go. That's splendid.
There we are.

619
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:40,069
First service now ready.
Take your seats for the first service.

620
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:47,800
Charlie, hot coffee and buttered rolls twice.

621
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,022
Oh, and a semolina for the spook.
Won't be long now, sir.

622
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,069
Oh I shouldn't put him here!
Why?

623
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,266
He's too near Ted's lamp.
He'd singe his parson's nose.

624
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:02,265
Wait a minute...

625
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:11,773
You're asking for a judgment, young man!
Joking like that about them that's gone.

626
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:15,929
Oh, ol' Ted wouldn't mind.
If he was alive now, he'd die laughing.

627
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:18,371
Wouldn't you, Ted?
Heh heh, good ol' Ted.

628
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:24,560
Herbert, ask them if they'd
like one of our sandwiches.
No.

629
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,892
Why not?
We want them.

630
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:32,975
Would you like one of our sandwiches?
We might as well share what we've got.

631
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,852
Oh it's awfully sweet of you.
That's all right. We've got plenty.

632
00:41:35,852 --> 00:41:37,878
Haven't we, Herbert?
That's right.

633
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:42,459
I've got two hard boiled eggs.
They don't agree with me.

634
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,016
Oh quite a party.
Tea, eggs, sandwiches.

635
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,934
Yeah, isn't this fun.
Let's see what else we can collect.

636
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:49,385
Well, I've got the salt.
And two pieces of sugar.

637
00:41:49,385 --> 00:41:50,236
Oh tah.

638
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:52,902
Oh no, they're for Polly.
She always has my rations.

639
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:58,548
I always give mine to Ted.
Hey fellow.

640
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:02,383
What about a slice of lemon for half-pint?
Now I warn you, Gander!

641
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:03,129
Hey you.

642
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,458
I have a little brandy here I always carry
with me, for medicinal purposes, of course.

643
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:13,997
Oh yes. I can see...  the cough...  the cold...
If anyone else would like a sip with their tea.

644
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:16,341
Brandy in tea!
That's disgusting!

645
00:42:16,342 --> 00:42:19,006
I don't know how a doctor
can bring himself to mention it.

646
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:22,734
I must say, I'm not surprised,
coming from him!

647
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:25,292
Do you mean to say you've never
tasted brandy in your tea?

648
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,316
I've never tasted alcohol in my life!

649
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:29,873
Then you shouldn't knock it back so quickly.
You should chew it a bit.

650
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:31,257
Thank you, doctor.

651
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:34,988
Here's my contribution, two sausage rolls,
very rare specimens.

652
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:35,732
Whose are these from?

653
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:37,863
Put it down!
Donâ€™t touch the exhibits!

654
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:41,308
Here. Go and force your rhubarb.
Let's all sit down.

655
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:43,191
Will you have one?
Oh thanks.

656
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:45,110
Sausage roll?
I don't recommend them.

657
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:50,544
Polly! Stuck his foot out that time!
Oh come and sit down.

658
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:53,100
Richard, some tea?
No thanks.

659
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:56,191
Sausage roll, doctor?
No thanks.

660
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:57,576
What? No cake?

661
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,346
We had a bit of cake,
but we ate it at Plymouth, didn't we Herbert?

662
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:01,730
That's right.
It's not right!

663
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:05,567
How can you have your cake
and eat it at Plymouth? Huh huh...

664
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:07,697
Oh well, uh,
I haven't provided anything yet.

665
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:10,255
Now let me see...
Oh there's a chocolate machine outside.

666
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,172
Give me your pennies and
I'll provide the sweets.
Eh?

667
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,262
That's the first sensible thing you've said.
Come on. Let's have your lovely pennies.

668
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:18,566
Tah. My benefit next Tuesday.
There we are.

669
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:20,803
What about you, auntie?
Two ha'pennies.

670
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:23,679
Oh well, ahâ€¦ give me those.
I'll give you a penny.

671
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,012
That's odd,
isn't it. Yeah yeah.

672
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:45,651
There you are, Ted.
Now he's in nobody's way.

673
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:51,077
That was the other foot!

674
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:59,555
Get out of here!
Close the door! Please!

675
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,980
I don't think I'll feel much like eating.
Well you ought to try it.

676
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,431
Okay miss. Keep asking.

677
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:10,987
I'm going to be Edna Turkins tomorrow.
Won't I, Herbert?

678
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:12,542
I hope so.

679
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,206
What the...

680
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:33,682
There you are.
Chocolates!

681
00:44:33,682 --> 00:44:37,625
Chocolates? You silly little man!
These are matches!

682
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:41,779
But I put ah uh...
Matches.

683
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,615
That's right.
Oh never mind. We'll do without.

684
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:47,853
Well, we'll just have to smoke lots
of cigarettes and use them up.

685
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:50,090
Cigarette, doctor?
Oh! Cigarettes!

686
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:54,673
Talking of cigarettes reminds me of
something that once happened to me.

687
00:44:54,673 --> 00:44:58,934
You know, I was sitting in a railway carriage
opposite a man with a bowler hat.

688
00:44:58,933 --> 00:45:01,203
And he was smoking a cigarette.

689
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:07,780
Well, the cigarette got shorter and shorter,
and suddenly I realized,

690
00:45:07,778 --> 00:45:14,811
it was burning right through his lip!
Sizzle - sizzle - sizzle.

691
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,072
I found out afterwards, he'd been
dead since Clapham Junction.

692
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:22,695
Now look here. Just because some
fool of a station master tells a story...

693
00:45:22,694 --> 00:45:24,582
Listen!

694
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,181
There's someone coming down the platform!

695
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:45,510
Wait!
They're over there now.

696
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:14,541
Aahhhh!
It's the stationmaster!

697
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:25,056
Looks serious.
Let's take him into the other room.

698
00:46:25,056 --> 00:46:29,134
I'll get some water.
I'll go. I know where it is.

699
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,689
Pick it up.

700
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,628
Better get him on the table here.

701
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:19,366
Oh dear. Oh dear.
Think I'm going off too.

702
00:47:19,365 --> 00:47:24,030
Well, I'm just as frightened as you are,
but we must try and pull ourselves together.

703
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,790
Here it is.
I run all the way.

704
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:37,265
I'm afraid you're too late.
Poor fellow.

705
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:41,633
We'll have to phone the police.
I'll do that.

706
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:44,410
Well, we'd better get back to the ladies.

707
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:52,288
How is he?
He's...  he's dead.

708
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,778
Dead?
I fear so.

709
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:56,017
As far as I can tell,
he died of shock.

710
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:59,213
I say you, don't think there
is anything in that story...
No, we don't!

711
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,811
Well if you don't,
I do!

712
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:02,623
Herbert, you've got to take me out of here.

713
00:48:02,623 --> 00:48:04,007
You can't go in this weather.

714
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:05,819
I'm not stopping here with no corpses!

715
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,803
Yes, but where are we going to?
I don't know.

716
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:13,491
Back to mother's somehow.
I think I'd rather stay here with the deceased.

717
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:18,267
I'm not stopping here with no corpses,
not for nobody! Come on, Herbert.

718
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:26,703
Richard, you're not going
to let them go like that.

719
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,407
If they want to go, it's their funeral.

720
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:30,326
Who said funeral?

721
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:32,456
Now don't you worry.
Everything's going to be all right.

722
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:37,252
Oh dear. To think that such a thing
should happen to me.

723
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:41,584
But nothing has happened to you...
yet.  Try this.

724
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:49,824
Oh dear. I shall never
be the same women again.

725
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:51,208
I can't get through to the police.

726
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,233
The line must be down.
Oh, pity

727
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:55,790
Police? What does he want
the police for?

728
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,389
Don't worry any more.

729
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,732
Where's the happy couple?
They're gone.

730
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:03,036
Gone? Where to?
They've gone to break the news to mother.

731
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:08,364
I want to go too. I don't like it here.
I want to go home.

732
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,174
Doctor, isn't there anything
you can do for her?

733
00:49:10,175 --> 00:49:11,986
Well, I, ah...
Ah, here we are!

734
00:49:11,986 --> 00:49:13,690
Doctor Hennessey's Blood Mixture!

735
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:16,781
Now this will put you on your feet...
or knock you off them.

736
00:49:16,781 --> 00:49:22,109
Cheerio! Aaahh.
Do you feel better now?

737
00:49:22,108 --> 00:49:25,773
You certainly look better.
Here. Try a drop more.

738
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:36,707
It smells like Christmas pudding!
Oh, I believe it's brandy.

739
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:40,371
No! Is it really?
Let me see.

740
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:45,761
Do you know, I believe you are right!
This is just what you want.

741
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:49,491
Not likely. I was born and raised
strict temperance.

742
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:52,794
And so I mean to stay.
But this is medicine!

743
00:49:52,794 --> 00:49:57,696
Well if you're sure.
But only a tiny drop now.

744
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:01,916
Just to relieve the palpitation.
Yes.

745
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:10,194
Cough it up.
Oh. Oh no. I've broken the pledge.

746
00:50:12,397 --> 00:50:14,956
It's warming me
all the way down!

747
00:50:14,957 --> 00:50:17,940
Yes, you wait till it gets to the junction!

748
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,456
It's not really nasty, is it?
No!

749
00:50:21,456 --> 00:50:25,718
I mean as medicines go.
That seems to be going pretty well.

750
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:30,272
I think I'd better take that, eh?
Ah, just a minute.

751
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:36,266
There you go.
She's got a bad - a huh - same as you have.

752
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,462
Now sip that slowly and you'll be
as right as rain.

753
00:50:39,462 --> 00:50:43,239
That's right.
Got a funny taste, doesn't it.

754
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:48,626
Listen, I just thought of something funny.
Well, that's a change!

755
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:50,650
Do you remember when he fell through the door?
Yeah.

756
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,633
It was just 11 o'clock.
What about it?

757
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,804
Don't you remember?

758
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:57,256
The stationmaster said that
that was the time that Ted Holmes...

759
00:50:57,256 --> 00:50:59,920
Shhh!
Will you shut up about all that!

760
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,395
I was only trying...
Hey! Here here here here!

761
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:10,727
Oh! Ah, look! All gone.
Now what have you been a doing, love?

762
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:22,402
In spite of all these terrible happenings,
I'm beginning to feel quite happy.

763
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:27,517
You naughty girl! Oohh!
You're tight and you like it!

764
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:35,615
â™ª Oh dear, what can the matter be?
Oh dear, what can the matter be? â™ª

765
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:38,490
â™ª Oh dear...
I think you'd better go and lie down.

766
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:42,752
Go lie down yourself.
I mean you'd be much more comfortable.

767
00:51:42,752 --> 00:51:45,309
I'm bubbly and comfortable, thank you!

768
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:49,464
Whoa! Whoops-a-daisy!
Whoops-a-blooming-buttercup!

769
00:51:49,464 --> 00:51:54,047
The buffet.
â™ª Little Miss Muffet, Off to the buffet. â™ª

770
00:51:54,046 --> 00:51:56,176
You know, everything's going around.

771
00:51:56,176 --> 00:52:00,865
I feel just as I did when I come off
the big wheel platform.

772
00:52:00,865 --> 00:52:04,915
Oh, not surprised.
â™ª Oh dear, what can the... â™ª

773
00:52:04,915 --> 00:52:06,512
You better come too.
Now now now.

774
00:52:06,512 --> 00:52:08,110
We're going to put you to bed.

775
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:13,226
Young man! I think you forget yourself!
He-he-hoo!

776
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:19,299
Young woman. I think you flatter yourself.
In we go.  â™ª Oh dear, what can the... â™ª

777
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:21,748
I don't want to go in here.
Yeah, go on. In you go.

778
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:24,306
No, I don't want to go in here.
Go in. Tickle-tickle!

779
00:52:24,306 --> 00:52:27,715
Oh, come on.
Here we are.

780
00:52:27,715 --> 00:52:30,485
This will make a lovely bed.
Come on.

781
00:52:30,485 --> 00:52:34,748
I tell you that I've got
a beautiful bed my home.
No!

782
00:52:34,748 --> 00:52:39,437
Oh yes I have.
I've got brass bedsteads in every room.

783
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:42,419
What do you think of that?
You hear that?

784
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:50,084
Brass bedsteads.
Brass bedsteads with knobs on. Knobs!

785
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:57,122
Whoa! Take it easy, missus.
Whoa-ho!

786
00:52:57,122 --> 00:53:03,942
Missus? Miss - Miss Bourne, and spinstress.
Spinstress.

787
00:53:03,941 --> 00:53:07,137
With knobs on.
I'm maiden laden.

788
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:10,654
Here we are.
It's going to be nice and comfortable.

789
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:16,196
Hmm, and let me tell you,
my funny blue-eyed boy.

790
00:53:16,195 --> 00:53:21,309
I was not neglected in my youth.
Hm-hmm.

791
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:25,039
Will one of you go get her rug for her?
I'll get it. I'll go. No, I'll get it.

792
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:28,554
Come on now.
It's no use. No use.

793
00:53:28,554 --> 00:53:31,538
No knobs.
Knobs? Never mind.

794
00:53:31,538 --> 00:53:33,349
Come on.
No knobs.

795
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,546
Wait a minute. Have you seen this?
What?

796
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,434
They all stay on!

797
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,495
Well when the chap did it at the Hippodrome,
they all stayed on.

798
00:53:45,495 --> 00:53:48,053
Ah good!
There you are.

799
00:53:48,053 --> 00:53:50,385
Now you'll be as snug as a rug in bug!

800
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:57,002
Look!
Knobs!

801
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:59,347
Knobs.
Lovely knobs.

802
00:53:59,347 --> 00:54:01,790
There you are.
Now go to sleep.

803
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:07,553
This place is getting more like
a mad house every minute!

804
00:54:08,403 --> 00:54:10,960
Richard!
What?

805
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,403
I thought I heard a scream.
You're imagining things.

806
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,832
What's the matter?

807
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:32,178
It's all right. Nothing to worry about.
Look I see! It's coming this way!

808
00:54:35,547 --> 00:54:38,128
Let me in!
Let me in!

809
00:54:44,107 --> 00:54:48,678
You must help me! Please help me!
Hide me from him!

810
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:52,408
Hide you? What you mean?
He's coming!

811
00:54:52,408 --> 00:54:54,859
He wants to take me back.
But I'm not going! I'm not!

812
00:54:54,859 --> 00:55:00,613
I've got to see it tonight!
I know it'll come. I always know.

813
00:55:00,612 --> 00:55:04,500
I'm afraid I don't follow you.
But you know! You must know!

814
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:10,480
There's a car coming down the road.
It's him!

815
00:55:11,265 --> 00:55:13,932
Don't let him find me!

816
00:55:15,848 --> 00:55:18,832
You can't go in there.
Then where can I go?

817
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:23,497
We'll look after you, won't we?
But he's coming, I tell you. Listen!

818
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:32,893
He's crashed!
I'll go out there.

819
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:35,346
You better stay here, Winthrop.
I'm coming!

820
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:36,839
You'd better come too, doctor.

821
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,504
Here! That's my coat.
Oh you look after the shop.

822
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,714
Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.

823
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,583
You've given your car a bit of a headache.

824
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:55,059
Oh look here. I've heard of it raining
cats and poodles.

825
00:55:55,058 --> 00:55:58,255
But never stockings
and brassieres.

826
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:01,451
Some damn fool left his luggage
in the middle of the road!

827
00:56:01,451 --> 00:56:04,434
Must be Edna and Herbert's.
We can't hang about with this.

828
00:56:04,434 --> 00:56:06,991
Best come with us.
There's a fire in the waiting room.

829
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:12,323
Bring the fenders with you.
Oh, he won't half-laugh when he sees this.

830
00:56:13,277 --> 00:56:16,826
Now stay in there.
And keep quiet!

831
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:29,905
Oh Herbert! Look at our fenders!
And my trousseau!

832
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:38,849
Well, who the devil are you people?
Well, who the devil are you?

833
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:42,153
Yes.   My name is Price.
Oh, I'm Tommy Gander.

834
00:56:42,153 --> 00:56:44,816
He's a scream.
Comedian and entertainer.

835
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:47,800
So far you've been n-EE-ther.
N-EYE-ther.   N-EE-ther.

836
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,397
N-EYE-ther.
Oh, we've been through all that.

837
00:56:49,397 --> 00:56:52,487
Oh Herbert.
My new nightie.

838
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:57,709
I shan't have anything to wear tomorrow night.
That's right!

839
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:00,266
What are you all doing here
at this time of night?

840
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,184
We might ask you the
same question.

841
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:05,273
I came out to look for my sister.
Your sister?

842
00:57:05,273 --> 00:57:07,937
Yes, I have certain reasons for believing
that she'd come to this place.

843
00:57:07,937 --> 00:57:10,387
Oh? And why do you think
she'd come here?

844
00:57:10,387 --> 00:57:12,731
I can't be expected to go
into that with strangers.

845
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:14,543
In that case,
I'm afraid we can't help you.

846
00:57:14,543 --> 00:57:17,098
I see. Then I'm afraid I shall
look for myself.

847
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,837
So she is in there.

848
00:57:25,837 --> 00:57:29,353
Before we get belligerent, don't you think
some explanation would help?

849
00:57:29,353 --> 00:57:36,813
All right, if you must know.
My sister is...  well, not quite normal.

850
00:57:36,812 --> 00:57:39,156
She suffers from delusions.

851
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:44,933
Normally she's kept under observation.
But tonight she got away.

852
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:50,451
It's a lie!
Don't listen to him.

853
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,116
He's trying to take me back.
So there you are, Julia.

854
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:59,827
It's no good. I can't come back.
You know I can't.

855
00:57:59,826 --> 00:58:03,269
Now be sensible, dear.
Oh what good is talking!

856
00:58:04,684 --> 00:58:10,802
I must stay here.
I can't help myself.

857
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:13,465
Julia...
Don't touch me! Go away!

858
00:58:13,465 --> 00:58:16,553
Just a minute! How do we know
that you're telling the truth?

859
00:58:16,553 --> 00:58:17,300
Here here!

860
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,111
Perhaps you'll be good enough
to mind your own business!

861
00:58:19,112 --> 00:58:22,201
Which is my business, if you insist on
taking her away against her will.

862
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:24,225
I associate myself with that unanimously!

863
00:58:24,225 --> 00:58:27,635
Now look here, Mr. Macintosh...
What's it got to do with you?

864
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:29,766
That's right.
What's it got to do with me?

865
00:58:29,766 --> 00:58:33,921
Dear!
Don't let him take me back, please!

866
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:37,651
Why can't she stay here?
At least until she's feeling better.

867
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:38,928
Now listen to me, please.

868
00:58:38,928 --> 00:58:41,273
You people have heard the story
of this place, I suppose.

869
00:58:41,274 --> 00:58:47,028
About the train that starts... screaming...
lamps... Ted Holmes... that crash!

870
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:49,477
He means the ghost train.
So-called.

871
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:53,846
Well that infernal nonsense is responsible
for my sister's mental condition.

872
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:56,294
She was near this station
one night several years ago.

873
00:58:56,295 --> 00:58:57,469
She thought she saw the train.

874
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:00,665
But I did see it. You know I saw it.
I did see it!

875
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:03,435
Yes, yes.
It was a great shock to her.

876
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:08,434
So great a shock that it...
well, affected her permanently.

877
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:11,640
Some nights she gets the idea
that the ghost train will run.

878
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,796
She has a morbid fascination for it.
She feels she must see it again.

879
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:20,696
Tonight is one of those games.
So I hope you understand.

880
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:25,811
But it will come tonight.
I know it will!

881
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:29,327
Yes, yes. By the way,
who told you this story?

882
00:59:29,327 --> 00:59:31,288
The stationmaster.
With all the trimmings!

883
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:34,117
Mind you, he warned us:
Twernt no pretty story.

884
00:59:34,118 --> 00:59:35,932
What, old Saul Hodgkin?
Where is he?

885
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:38,597
He's in the ticket office.
He's dead!

886
00:59:38,597 --> 00:59:42,965
That's right!
Saul Hodgkin dead! Good heavens!

887
00:59:42,964 --> 00:59:45,185
His troubles are over.

888
00:59:46,058 --> 00:59:48,498
I've locked the door.

889
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:58,734
Is this a joke?
Because if so, it doesn't amuse me!

890
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:01,824
Of course not!
We put him on there, ourselves!

891
01:00:01,824 --> 01:00:03,314
Well, where is he now?
I don't know.

892
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:05,340
We were all in the other room,
so he can't have gone out!

893
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,783
Apart from being dead!

894
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:10,560
Stop!
He can't have...

895
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,011
When is all this supposed to have happened?

896
01:00:13,012 --> 01:00:16,741
Well it happened all right! We all saw it!
That's right.

897
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,338
Yes, you ask this gentleman.
He's a doctor.

898
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:19,937
He should know a dead body
when he sees one.

899
01:00:19,937 --> 01:00:24,092
Yes, ah...
I rather think I should, eh?

900
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:26,969
The man was certainly dead.
Heart failure.

901
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:30,273
In my opinion, the result of a shock.
What happened exactly?

902
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:31,870
Well, he left here to go home.

903
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:34,321
And about 20 minutes later,
we heard footsteps.

904
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:36,665
When I opened the door,
he fell forward into the room.

905
01:00:36,665 --> 01:00:39,862
Which door?
That one.

906
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:44,337
I knew it!
Don't you see?

907
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:46,147
It wasn't Saul Hodgkin at all!

908
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:50,091
It was Ted Holmes,
coming back from the dead!

909
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,581
What did he look like?

910
01:00:51,582 --> 01:00:54,032
You mean his face?
Yes yes!

911
01:00:54,032 --> 01:00:57,762
Well, ah, have you ever seen a bad nut?
Eaten lots of them.

912
01:00:57,762 --> 01:01:00,851
He was a tall, gaunt sort of fellow.
Are you sure of that?

913
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:06,606
Of course! It wasn't the stationmaster.
It was Ted Holmes!

914
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:08,096
Come now, Julia!

915
01:01:08,096 --> 01:01:10,333
You're upsetting everybody.
It must have been Hodgkin.

916
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,638
Then where is he?
A man couldn't vanish into thin air!

917
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:18,113
And the time when all this happened,
it was eleven o'clock, wasn't it?

918
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,350
Wasn't it?
Sharp!

919
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:25,251
That proves it!
We've got to get her away from here.

920
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:29,407
No! I'm staying.
I'm staying here till it comes.

921
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:32,922
You know it will come.
You say I imagine it.

922
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,946
But you only want to put me away,
like you did before!

923
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:37,611
No, I'm not leaving.
I'm going to see it!

924
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,594
I must see it, even if it kills me!
That's enough, Julia.

925
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:41,765
Don't touch me!
Julia!

926
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:46,774
If you don't mind, if she were a
patient of mine, I'd let her stay.

927
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:47,946
You don't understand.

928
01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:50,396
Quite likely.
They do say I'm old-fashioned.

929
01:01:50,397 --> 01:01:54,126
But if she stays,
and the train doesn't come,
and it won't,

930
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:58,814
she will realize then
that it is only a delusion.
Surely that's only common sense, eh?

931
01:01:58,814 --> 01:02:03,182
All right. Don't think I'm gonna
be any party to this tomfoolery.

932
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:05,958
As soon as I can find another car,
you're coming back with me!

933
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:10,002
Mr. Macintosh, if we shouldn't be here
when you get back,

934
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:15,241
will you see the papers spell my name right?
It is G-A-N-D...

935
01:02:17,353 --> 01:02:21,402
He's gone.
Yes, you'll be all right now.

936
01:02:21,401 --> 01:02:23,212
As soon as the rain stops,
we can all go.

937
01:02:23,213 --> 01:02:27,689
No! I'm staying here!
Of course, just as you like.

938
01:02:27,688 --> 01:02:34,508
Like? This isn't about like.
It's because I can't help myself.

939
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:41,114
This place terrifies me.
It fascinates me too.

940
01:02:41,113 --> 01:02:44,097
It's full of eyes.

941
01:02:44,097 --> 01:02:50,278
They stare! And stare!
Don't look at me like that!

942
01:02:50,277 --> 01:02:52,940
You think I'm mad!
But I'm not mad!

943
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:57,842
Oh now - I - I
I - ah - there you go.

944
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:03,489
You see, I know what's going to happen.
And it's going to happen soon.

945
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:06,686
The scream of brakes!
The shriek of the whistle!

946
01:03:06,686 --> 01:03:13,186
Louder! Louder! Why don't you all go now
and leave me before it's too late!

947
01:03:13,184 --> 01:03:15,741
When the train comes...
A train won't come.

948
01:03:15,742 --> 01:03:16,913
It came that night!

949
01:03:16,913 --> 01:03:20,749
I saw it thundering down the valley...
On! On! Into the river...

950
01:03:20,749 --> 01:03:25,651
Then I saw Ben Issacs, the driver,
coming back out of the tunnel!

951
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,495
But weren't they all killed?

952
01:03:27,496 --> 01:03:30,552
All except Ben Isaacs.
He was thrown clear.

953
01:03:30,552 --> 01:03:37,052
He came back to the station singing...
Singing Rock of Ages.

954
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:40,606
His mind gone!

955
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:49,412
They say that before the ghost train runs,
you hear the bell ringing... dismally.

956
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:53,247
It will be here soon!
I know it!

957
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:59,534
Look! Don't you see?
There! Look!

958
01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:03,901
It's Ted Holmes again,
coming out of the office!

959
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:12,108
Don't you see?
Yes, yes of course.

960
01:04:12,106 --> 01:04:15,994
But, uh, don't you think
it would be better if we all...

961
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:24,363
He's crossing towards the door!

962
01:04:26,169 --> 01:04:29,946
Look! He's opening the door!

963
01:04:39,189 --> 01:04:41,299
It's all right.
It's only the wind.

964
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:46,628
I've got an aunt who suffers with that.
Her doors are always blowing open.

965
01:04:46,627 --> 01:04:48,226
Now aren't you sorry?

966
01:04:48,226 --> 01:04:51,741
I think this room is worrying you.
Let's go to the refreshment room and...

967
01:04:51,741 --> 01:04:56,004
If you open the door now,
you'll find he's still there!

968
01:04:56,004 --> 01:04:59,413
We'll soon see!
No, wait!

969
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:04,315
Now listen to me, my dear.
There's nothing to worry about.

970
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:10,202
Come over by the fire
Come along. ... There.

971
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:19,763
Now listen. I've got a nasty feeling
we haven't got over the worst of this yet.

972
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:23,599
I want you to promise that if anything
unpleasant happens you'll be guided by me.

973
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:24,932
All right.

974
01:05:25,623 --> 01:05:29,178
Look! The light's going out!

975
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,238
Why don't you go?
There's still time!

976
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:39,475
We can't go!
Then stop your ears!

977
01:05:39,475 --> 01:05:43,630
For God's sake, don't look!
Remember what happened to me.

978
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,740
You must be warned!
You must!

979
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:55,246
Listen! A signal bell!
Now will you believe me?

980
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:59,400
Nonsense! That doesn't prove anything.
But the bell...   It always rings!

981
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,065
Now look here! This is absurd!

982
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:07,177
What was that?
What?

983
01:06:07,177 --> 01:06:13,998
I thought I heard a train whistle.
It's coming! It's coming!

984
01:06:13,997 --> 01:06:17,299
She's right!
It is a train!

985
01:06:17,299 --> 01:06:22,308
Thundering down the valley!
It's coming! It's coming!

986
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:25,929
On! On!
I'm going to look!

987
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:27,484
No!

988
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:31,863
It won't open!

989
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:40,293
We're shut in.

990
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,617
Listen!
Listen to it!

991
01:06:43,617 --> 01:06:47,616
I've got to see it!
I must see it!

992
01:07:10,892 --> 01:07:13,131
Is she...
Is she dead?

993
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:16,861
No no. Her pulse is weak,
but steady enough.

994
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:18,885
Would you get me some water, please?

995
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:20,163
Yes, of course.
Wait a minute.

996
01:07:20,163 --> 01:07:22,827
There's no more water in there.
I'll get some from outside.

997
01:07:22,828 --> 01:07:24,745
You show me where it is.

998
01:07:24,745 --> 01:07:28,048
Oh, I just remembered!
The ghost train had all its light on.

999
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:28,474
Well shat about it?

1000
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:30,499
Well they'll get pinched!
It's after blackout time.

1001
01:07:30,499 --> 01:07:32,629
Don't be silly.
All that was 43 years ago.

1002
01:07:32,629 --> 01:07:35,399
There was no war on then.
Yes there was.

1003
01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:37,210
There was the Boer War.

1004
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:41,794
I can't stand any more of this.
I've come to the end of me tether.

1005
01:07:41,793 --> 01:07:43,817
Where's the other stocking?

1006
01:07:43,818 --> 01:07:46,588
Now, I want you to go right back in there.

1007
01:07:46,588 --> 01:07:48,398
And whatever happens,
don't let anyone leave.

1008
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:50,742
Where are you going?
To get some water.

1009
01:07:50,742 --> 01:07:53,406
We don't need any water.
Well what about Fanny Fadeaway?

1010
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,963
Yes, the doctor said...
Please, we have no time to explain that now.

1011
01:07:55,963 --> 01:07:58,308
You said you'd trust me.
Yes, I do.

1012
01:07:58,308 --> 01:07:59,692
But where will you be?

1013
01:07:59,692 --> 01:08:01,716
We're going outside
to do a bit of snooping.

1014
01:08:01,717 --> 01:08:04,061
Snooping?
That's an idea!

1015
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:06,511
You'll be Charlie Chan.
I'll be honorable son.

1016
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:08,429
What if they ask me where you are?

1017
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:13,225
Tell them unworthy servants take despicable
glass to get unspeakable water.

1018
01:08:13,224 --> 01:08:15,675
Go on. Go back inside there.
That's a good girl.

1019
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:19,298
Go. Go. Go.
She's gone.

1020
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:21,641
Now where's this bridge wheel?
What bridge wheel?

1021
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:24,305
Oh, I don't know whether I'd bother about that.
Remember what happened to Edward.

1022
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:26,116
Edward?
Edward Holmmmmes.

1023
01:08:26,117 --> 01:08:30,005
Oh, go on. Show me where it is.
This way.

1024
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:33,255
That's it over there.
Looks like a washing up machine.

1025
01:08:33,255 --> 01:08:35,810
Oh, so this is the historic spot.

1026
01:08:37,483 --> 01:08:41,566
I say, it doesn't go smoke smoke - funny.
I bet you can't say that quickly.

1027
01:08:41,566 --> 01:08:44,763
It doesn't go smoke smoke...
Try that with me other teeth in.

1028
01:08:44,763 --> 01:08:47,533
Hello! It isn't there!
What isn't?

1029
01:08:47,533 --> 01:08:50,516
The old man's lamp. I put it there
when I came to get the water.

1030
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:53,926
I say, didn't old Saul Hodgkin say
this bridge was always open.

1031
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:56,163
It ain't been closed these 43 years,
it ain't.

1032
01:08:56,163 --> 01:08:58,827
It ain't, eh?
Well, look at that - closed!

1033
01:08:58,827 --> 01:09:00,851
That's funny.
It was open just now.

1034
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:13,746
â™ª Rock of ages, cleft for me.
Let me hide myself in thee. â™ª

1035
01:09:13,743 --> 01:09:24,854
â™ª Let the water and the blood...   â™ª
Ben Isaacs! He's coming back!

1036
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,832
Oh, I warned you!
I warned you!

1037
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:42,941
â™ª Be of sin the double-cure.
Cleanse me from its guilt and power. â™ª

1038
01:09:42,938 --> 01:09:46,347
There where shots!

1039
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:49,457
Got him!
Don't let him get away!

1040
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:17,322
I can't see any ghosts.
I probably run through it.

1041
01:10:22,075 --> 01:10:27,928
Teddy? Teddy?
Teddy? Where are you?

1042
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:35,147
John, take me away from here!
I'll come with you now.

1043
01:10:35,146 --> 01:10:36,210
It's all right, Julia.

1044
01:10:36,211 --> 01:10:37,703
I've managed to get a bus.
It's outside.

1045
01:10:37,704 --> 01:10:40,581
Oh, well played, sir!
That's right. Come on, Edna.

1046
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:43,032
So if you're ready,
I suggest we don't waste any time.

1047
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:44,842
We've been here too long as it is!

1048
01:10:44,842 --> 01:10:47,505
Yes, but some idiot's been
fooling around with a gun outside.

1049
01:10:47,505 --> 01:10:49,636
What?
Didn't you hear?

1050
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:51,235
Yes.
Just now.

1051
01:10:51,235 --> 01:10:55,924
But you can't leave here until...
...until the police arrive!

1052
01:10:55,924 --> 01:10:59,653
So you're the idiot with the gun!
I might have known it!

1053
01:10:59,652 --> 01:11:02,955
What the blazes have
you been shooting at?

1054
01:11:02,955 --> 01:11:06,684
A ghost.
And no ordinary ghost either.

1055
01:11:06,684 --> 01:11:09,242
This one had a signature tune.

1056
01:11:09,242 --> 01:11:12,651
Oh, I'm sick of all this nonsense.
Come on. Let's go.

1057
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:16,167
Wait a minute!
I'm afraid nobody goes!

1058
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:18,388
Excuse me...

1059
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:21,601
Now look here!
Get back!

1060
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:25,713
Go on!
Sit down.

1061
01:11:26,503 --> 01:11:29,724
Have you gone mad?
On the contrary!

1062
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:34,310
I suppose everyone knows
what this is...

1063
01:11:36,908 --> 01:11:41,206
Believe it or not, the blood of Ben Isaacs.
I've winged a ghost!

1064
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:44,403
Oh rot!
If you don't open these doors...

1065
01:11:44,403 --> 01:11:48,772
Mr. Winthrop, wouldn't be any reason
why you'd want us all away from here,
would there?

1066
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:54,099
And what the devil do you mean by that?
Yes! I like to know that, too!

1067
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:55,696
Perhaps I should explain that...

1068
01:11:55,696 --> 01:11:59,362
the person responsible for the ghost
train is with us in this room now!

1069
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,647
The ghost train?
Yes.

1070
01:12:04,647 --> 01:12:06,031
Only it isn't a ghost train.

1071
01:12:06,032 --> 01:12:09,476
This one happens to be as real
as the Plymouth Express.

1072
01:12:11,253 --> 01:12:15,089
But, uh, there was
an accident, you know.

1073
01:12:15,089 --> 01:12:18,711
Perfectly true! There's a strong
local superstition about the ghost train.

1074
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:22,441
That's what gave somebody
in this room the idea.

1075
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,489
Made their job easier, because for years,
people have stuck their heads

1076
01:12:26,489 --> 01:12:28,940
under their bedclothes if they
heard a train in the night!

1077
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,710
But when we turned up,
we made it rather awkward for them.

1078
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:33,882
So when the stationmaster
couldn't get rid of us,

1079
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,292
they set to work,
scaring us out!

1080
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:41,833
But they didn't, did they?
Uh, no. Bless my soul.

1081
01:12:41,832 --> 01:12:46,627
Don't look at me like that.
I don't know anything about it!

1082
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:50,995
I assure you. I'm going to Red Roofs
as Dr. Hariby's locum. Eh?

1083
01:12:50,995 --> 01:12:55,578
Just a moment. I don't pretend
to understand all this.

1084
01:12:55,577 --> 01:12:59,306
But you and your silly little friend have
been behaving rather queerly yourselves.

1085
01:12:59,306 --> 01:13:03,355
Exactly what game are you playing at?
Richard, I just remembered.

1086
01:13:03,355 --> 01:13:07,617
If it hadn't been for Mr. Gander,
you wouldn't be here at all.

1087
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:11,239
Jackie!
I say there! Well! Oh!

1088
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:14,435
Richard! Did you have to do that?
Of course! The man's undoable.

1089
01:13:14,435 --> 01:13:17,312
Might have shot someone at any moment!
Oh, here's the key.

1090
01:13:17,312 --> 01:13:21,256
Now we can get out of here.
But you can't leave him here like this!

1091
01:13:21,256 --> 01:13:22,640
Don't worry. We're going
to take him with us.

1092
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:24,771
Yes, a little fresh air will soon
bring him around.

1093
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:26,156
Will you two bring him to the bus?

1094
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:28,606
Yes, definitely.
Right.

1095
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:31,606
Go on, Herbert. You help.
What? Me?

1096
01:13:35,319 --> 01:13:37,876
Your bag, Doctor.
Oh, yes. I'll come back for them.

1097
01:13:37,877 --> 01:13:40,654
Uh, be careful.
Steady.

1098
01:13:45,749 --> 01:13:48,638
Oh, thank heaven we can get out of here.
I'm sick of this hole.

1099
01:13:48,638 --> 01:13:53,082
Yeah, I don't want to complain,
but I do hope this will be all for tonight.

1100
01:13:56,369 --> 01:14:01,194
He'll be all right in here.
Leave him there.

1101
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:14,339
All right, driver.
Hey! Hey! Wait a minute!

1102
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:19,324
I nearly missed the bus.
That's right.

1103
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:21,775
Where the blazes have you been?
Trying to get out of the tunnel.

1104
01:14:21,775 --> 01:14:23,052
I couldn't find the hole.

1105
01:14:23,053 --> 01:14:25,397
All right now, sir?
Yes, but step on it, will you?

1106
01:14:25,397 --> 01:14:27,954
Wait a minute.
My basket's still in the station.

1107
01:14:27,954 --> 01:14:29,552
We'll attend to that in the morning.

1108
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:32,109
Yes, but say it disappears.
I won't be able to open on Monday!

1109
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:33,920
That will be a break for New Key!

1110
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,944
Well, we're off.

1111
01:14:35,945 --> 01:14:39,356
Yes. What a bit of luck
finding a bus, eh?

1112
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:44,043
Oh, look at Teddy!
Shh! He's gone to sleep.

1113
01:14:44,043 --> 01:14:46,601
Yes, I put him to sleep.
Yes.

1114
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:50,863
Hey, you mean you... ah...
on the floor?

1115
01:14:50,863 --> 01:14:54,699
Yes, and if we have any trouble from you,
you're just as likely to join him!

1116
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:58,808
Don't let's have any more unpleasantness.
No.

1117
01:15:02,903 --> 01:15:05,140
Anybody got any smelling salts?

1118
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,763
You haven't got a drop of that...
huh huh... no no.

1119
01:15:08,763 --> 01:15:10,360
Come on. Come to Daddy.

1120
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,343
Oh, I wish I'd paid attention
at the first aid class.

1121
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:14,835
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

1122
01:15:14,836 --> 01:15:16,860
Just a moment.
I want to ask you a question.

1123
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,630
Where exactly did you go when
you left the waiting room?

1124
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:21,122
Who me?
Outside.

1125
01:15:21,123 --> 01:15:23,253
Don't you remember when the
spook special came along?

1126
01:15:23,253 --> 01:15:24,531
Yes, I remember perfectly.

1127
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:28,261
But it's very curious that when you and
your friend went out, things began to happen.

1128
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,391
Oh, you mean old Rock of Ages!

1129
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:34,548
It was Ben Isaacs. He was coming
back. I knew he would.

1130
01:15:34,547 --> 01:15:35,931
Now Julia.

1131
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:38,596
Something...
What hit me?

1132
01:15:38,596 --> 01:15:41,579
I'm afraid I did. I'm very sorry,
but it was entirely necessary.

1133
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,522
What do you...  Where are we?
Why you...

1134
01:15:45,522 --> 01:15:47,973
Now! Now! Now! Now, pal.
Count up to ten.

1135
01:15:47,973 --> 01:15:49,890
1 - 2 - 3 ...
You blithering idiot!

1136
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:52,873
Where did you get to?
Oh, I walked into the tunnel wall.

1137
01:15:52,873 --> 01:15:57,775
I blacked myself out in the knockout.
I mean, I knocked myself out in the blackout.

1138
01:15:57,775 --> 01:16:00,971
Well, I think we can say we successfully
stopped your little game, whatever it was.

1139
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:02,569
You've successfully mucked up
the whole show!

1140
01:16:02,569 --> 01:16:04,593
Now there's no one to get that train
when it comes back comes back!

1141
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,259
Comes back?

1142
01:16:06,511 --> 01:16:09,069
The ghost train never comes back.

1143
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:12,372
This one's more obliging.
It makes the return journey.

1144
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:16,101
But if the train does come back,
It'll have to cross the bridge, won't it?

1145
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:18,019
Of course.
But if it's a ghost train,

1146
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:20,469
it wouldn't matter whether the bridge
was open or closed, would it?

1147
01:16:20,469 --> 01:16:22,280
No, but...
Oh, well, that's all right.

1148
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:23,985
What are you babbling about?

1149
01:16:23,985 --> 01:16:26,436
Well, we'll soon see.
I opened the bridge!

1150
01:16:26,436 --> 01:16:28,779
You've done what?

1151
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:31,338
Well, somebody had closed it,
so I opened it!

1152
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:32,935
Otherwise the story would be right.

1153
01:16:32,935 --> 01:16:35,046
You meddling fool!

1154
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,913
Nichols!
Stop!

1155
01:16:39,648 --> 01:16:42,524
I say, what is this?
Sit down!

1156
01:16:42,524 --> 01:16:44,656
I'll do nothing of the sort!
I rather think you will!

1157
01:16:44,656 --> 01:16:49,770
What are you doing? You can't...
Keep still, unless you're looking for trouble.

1158
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:52,114
He's opened the bridge!
Back to the station, black out!

1159
01:16:52,114 --> 01:16:54,991
It's too late, sir. We passed
Crawford's crossroads a mile back!

1160
01:16:54,991 --> 01:16:57,548
If we get across the footbridge,
you can stop them on the other side.

1161
01:16:57,548 --> 01:16:59,785
Yes! Back down the lane!
As fast as you can!

1162
01:16:59,785 --> 01:17:00,896
All right.

1163
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:37,930
That's the lot.
We're not late, are we?

1164
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,929
The ghost train's never late!

1165
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,124
Can't you go any faster?

1166
01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:09,255
If it goes any faster,
we'll take off!

1167
01:18:09,256 --> 01:18:10,960
I hope you're enjoying all this!

1168
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,878
If you hadn't been so anxious
to show off your right hook,

1169
01:18:12,878 --> 01:18:14,155
we wouldn't be in this mess!

1170
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,967
But what's happening?
I don't understand!

1171
01:18:15,967 --> 01:18:17,991
You ever heard of the fifth column?
What?

1172
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:20,975
The chap with the gun
is a Nazi sympathizer.

1173
01:18:20,975 --> 01:18:22,574
The more they pay him,
the more he sympathizes!

1174
01:18:22,574 --> 01:18:23,638
Cut that out!

1175
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:25,983
But smuggling arms is a
dangerous game in war times.

1176
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:27,687
So they invented the ghost train.

1177
01:18:27,688 --> 01:18:30,020
The train!
I can see it!

1178
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:34,400
It's on the last curve before the bridge!

1179
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,064
We'll never stop it!
We've got to stop it!

1180
01:18:37,064 --> 01:18:41,174
Take a pull up here.
I'm cutting down the hill. Stop!

1181
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:46,356
Watch them!
Ohh...

1182
01:18:47,399 --> 01:18:50,176
Come on!
Make whole!

1183
01:19:06,414 --> 01:19:08,709
Oh, by the way,
you took a gun from him.

1184
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:11,375
Hand it over.
Come on!

1185
01:19:14,994 --> 01:19:18,772
[honks horn]
What?

1186
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:21,896
Come on!

1187
01:19:29,485 --> 01:19:33,040
The bridge!
It's open!

1188
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,409
Of course, after Julia had fainted,

1189
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,542
I knew that Sterling was
no more a doctor than I was!

1190
01:19:51,542 --> 01:19:53,779
How?
I saw him taking your pulse with his thumb.

1191
01:19:53,779 --> 01:19:56,442
You did! You knew nothing
about it until I told you!

1192
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:58,466
Well after all, I did open the bridge

1193
01:19:58,467 --> 01:20:00,490
while you were lying there
like a British heavyweight!

1194
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,556
Oh, there you are, sir.

1195
01:20:01,557 --> 01:20:04,647
I take it we can get you at
this address for the inquest.

1196
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:06,671
Correct, Capitan.
Thank you then.

1197
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:08,909
Thank you, sir.
...Thank you, sir.

1198
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:10,933
Well that'll be your special service,
due any minute.

1199
01:20:10,934 --> 01:20:11,933
Thank you very much.

1200
01:20:14,129 --> 01:20:17,859
Do you know, I have an idea you're
by no means what you make out to be.

1201
01:20:17,858 --> 01:20:20,629
Confidentially, I'm not!
You must be relieved.

1202
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:22,013
Ah, there you are.

1203
01:20:22,014 --> 01:20:25,424
I'm afraid, old boy,
I've been a bit of a...

1204
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:27,981
A bit of a... ?
I think you've been a lot of a... !

1205
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:30,431
Well anyway, if you'll accept my apologies.
Of course.

1206
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:33,875
And you, Gander.
And you, Winthrop.

1207
01:20:36,611 --> 01:20:41,721
Ah! Knobs! We've forgotten about
the old bird with her old bird!

1208
01:20:47,967 --> 01:20:53,234
Ohh....  Feel better?
I've got a terrible headache.

1209
01:20:53,233 --> 01:20:55,790
Don't tell me. You've got a piece of
flannel where your tongue should be.

1210
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:56,962
How did you know?

1211
01:20:56,963 --> 01:21:00,158
Never mind. The train's in now.
You'll soon be safe in Truro.

1212
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,741
Good. I'm so glad nothing
exciting has happened.

1213
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:10,739
Nothing exciting!
There you go...

1214
01:21:11,305 --> 01:22:11,235
