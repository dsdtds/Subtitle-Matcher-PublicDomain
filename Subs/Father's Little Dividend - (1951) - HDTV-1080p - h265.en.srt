1
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:19,212
Ellie?

2
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:21,548
Ellie, hurry up!
We've only got five minutes.

3
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,008
I'll be right down.

4
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,946
I'd like to say a few words
about what's happened

5
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,032
to me over the past year.

6
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,576
You women may not sympathize.
You think men have it easy.

7
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,870
But that's where you're wrong.

8
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,998
Man is a very delicate
and sensitive mechanism.

9
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:56,958
If you treat him right,
you flatter him

10
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,087
and butter him up a little bit,
he's good for years.

11
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:02,047
But if somebody
rocks the boat...

12
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,927
Well, you know how it is, men.

13
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:10,013
You work hard for years,
trying to build a home,

14
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:14,101
raise a family, and then
comes one wonderful day

15
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:15,602
when, for the first time
in your life,

16
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:16,978
you feel you're a little
ahead of the game.

17
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,647
Things have eased up
at the office.

18
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:23,360
The kids are all set, married
or well along in school or both,

19
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,696
and you're raring to go.

20
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,531
You think of all
the wonderful things

21
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:30,325
you would have done in your life
if you just had time.

22
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,704
You go fishing.

23
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:35,789
You go big-game hunting.

24
00:02:35,914 --> 00:02:38,500
You might even climb
Mount Everest.

25
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,002
Anyway, you're on
top of the world.

26
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,629
You begin to feel
you're a combination

27
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,589
of Don Juan and Columbus.

28
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,761
And that's just the moment
they choose to let you have it.

29
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:55,308
I remember it was
just a year ago today.

30
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:59,730
I caught my usual
commuter's train.

31
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:01,314
It was late, as usual.

32
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,734
It was such a beautiful day
that I let the bus go by

33
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:06,236
and walked home
from the station.

34
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,822
It was one of those
first warm days in May

35
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:11,158
when everything seems
to come to life.

36
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,119
I felt particularly well.

37
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,871
I was thinking
what a lucky man I was,

38
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,497
with a nice house all paid for,

39
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:21,168
three children all paid for,
and a beautiful wife.

40
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:26,339
Ellie.

41
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:28,175
- Oh, hi, Pa.
- Hi, boys. Hello, Del.

42
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,177
- Mr. Banks.
- Ellie, I'm home!

43
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,345
Coming.

44
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,098
Ellie was radiant that night.

45
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:37,017
She seemed to be
floating on air.

46
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:39,352
Stanley, what kept you?
It's late.

47
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:41,062
Such a nice day, I walked.

48
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,030
Stanley!

49
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,157
What's the matter?
Can't a fella kiss his wife?

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,703
Oh, you won't have time
to change.

51
00:03:56,828 --> 00:03:57,954
We have to start right away.

52
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,039
Why? Where are we going?

53
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,707
Kay and Buckley asked us
to their apartment

54
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:01,708
for dinner tonight.

55
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,002
She phoned this morning,
said she had some good news.

56
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,004
Oh! Oh! Buckley put over
the deal, I guess,

57
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,130
with the chain stores, huh?

58
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,673
That plastic bag of his?

59
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,217
Oh, I don't think
that's their big news.

60
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:12,219
I think it's something
much more important that that.

61
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:14,554
More important than that? Why?
That means thousands of dollars.

62
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,807
I don't know. What could be
more important than that?

63
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,517
Something, nothing.

64
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:19,851
- Get my coat, will you, dear?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,102
Night, Tommy.
Night, Ben.

66
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,395
Good night, Mom.

67
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,231
Kay said she was sorry
she couldn't have you, too,

68
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:27,108
but she had to have Buckley's
father and mother.

69
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,568
- Is Kay gonna cook?
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:30,111
You better take
your bicarb with you.

71
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,738
Oh, no.

72
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:33,698
- Oh, boys, don't keep Delilah.
- Son, son, your jokes

73
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,534
- get funnier every year.
- Stanley, please!

74
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,993
I promised her
she could go to the movie.

75
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:38,787
Ben, you drop her on your way
to the game.

76
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,623
Oh, and, uh, Delilah,
stack the dishes until after.

77
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,833
You'll miss the first
of the picture.

78
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,918
- Thanks, Miss Banks.
- Um, Tommy don't study too late.

79
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,128
Remember, if the rug man calls,
tell him to call â€”

80
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:48,880
S-Stanley!

81
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:51,383
What's got into you?

82
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,801
It's spring.

83
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,428
It must be.

84
00:04:58,348 --> 00:04:59,975
Yes, sir, we're in a rut, Ellie.

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,351
Not that it isn't
a pleasant rut,

86
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:02,686
but I think we ought to
get out of it.

87
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,396
You know, you're
a very beautiful woman, Ellie.

88
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,438
Why, Stan.

89
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:07,691
A very, very beautiful woman.

90
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,109
Trouble is, I never see you.

91
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:10,402
Come home at night,
you wanna know

92
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,528
if I've seen the hole
in the carpet

93
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,029
or whether I'll fix
the leaky faucet.

94
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:14,072
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,157
Oh, I don't mean that
it's your fault. No.

96
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,659
I think we ought
to forgot about it, though.

97
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,536
We ought to forget the house,
forget the whole thing,

98
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,037
go away and take a trip.

99
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:24,249
No reason why we can't.
We're as free as the air.

100
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,418
Kinda like when we were
first married.

101
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:28,837
Before Kay came along.

102
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,755
Only this time we're not broke.

103
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,007
We could even go to Europe.

104
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,426
I think we better wait
and hear what Kay has to say.

105
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,887
Honolulu! What about Honolulu?
That's the place.

106
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,513
- How about it, Ellie?
- We'll see.

107
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,931
Oh, sure.

108
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:44,019
Waikiki beach,
moonlight on Waikiki.

109
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,688
Flowers, ukulele, romance.

110
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,487
Well, I'm gonna call up that
travel agency in the morning,

111
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,239
find out about those trailers.

112
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,118
- Hi, there!
- Hello, darling!

113
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:03,705
There she was, my Kay,
the darling of my heart.

114
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,333
I couldn't yet believe
she was a married woman.

115
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,961
She still seemed like kid to me
playing at keeping house.

116
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:11,671
How are you?
You feeling alright?

117
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,007
Feeling alright?
Look at her. How does she look?

118
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:15,133
Never looked better in her life.

119
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:17,010
Oh, thank you, Pops.

120
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,013
- How's he treating you?
- Oh, fine.

121
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,807
- You miss me?
- Hmm, don't talk.

122
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,392
- Hello, hello!
- Buckley dear.

123
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,020
I was full of the milk
of human kindness that night.

124
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:30,023
I even looked at my son-in-law
with a friendly eye.

125
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:31,983
I don't say
that he was my ideal,

126
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,526
but I was getting used to him.

127
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,779
Father Banks, how are you?
Nice to see you!

128
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:38,365
How have you been?
Oh, give me your hat!

129
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,742
Say, uh, do you think
we could kinda do away

130
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,077
with that "Father Banks" stuff?

131
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,537
- Just call me Stanley.
- Okay, Stan.

132
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:46,665
Alright, not Stan.
Stanley.

133
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,916
- Stanley?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,209
Okay, Stanley.

135
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:50,460
How about little golf
on Sunday?

136
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:51,586
Ah, you're on.

137
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,547
Doris, it's wonderful
to see you again.

138
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:56,424
Well, Herbert boy, how are you?

139
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,509
Oh, so-so.

140
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,302
So-so?
Why, you look wonderful.

141
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,012
- Doris, how are you?
- How are you?

142
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,180
What's wrong with the old man?

143
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,224
It's the spring.
It always takes it out of him.

144
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:06,434
Takes it out? Puts it into me,
doesn't it, Ellie?

145
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,436
I suppose you got
the same message we did.

146
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,562
- Very important news.
- Yes, yes.

147
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:10,689
That's right.

148
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:12,857
- Kay, I can't wait.
- You have your cocktail.

149
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,901
Oh, darling,
you can't do this to us.

150
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,820
Buckley, you tell us.
We're all here now.

151
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:18,613
- Thank you, Buckley.
- Hope it's what I hope it is.

152
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,907
I know what it is.
Great news, eh, Buckley?

153
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:22,575
Well, I-I think it is.

154
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,537
Oh, Buckley did you tell them
and not tell us?

155
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:27,664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I guessed it.

156
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:28,873
You really put it over,
didn't you, boy?

157
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,001
Oh, Buckley, he's not right.
It's not that horrid contract.

158
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,460
A contract?
Is that what it is?

159
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,129
Thousands of dollars.

160
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,339
Oh, and we hoped it was a baby.

161
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:39,384
Oh, I prayed for a baby,
and now to hear this.

162
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,428
But, Mom, that's what it is.
It is a baby!

163
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,179
- A baby!
- What? A baby?

164
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:45,807
Oh, Buckley, that's wonderful!

165
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,976
Oh-ho, congratulations!

166
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,186
I'd never seen such excitement.

167
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:52,105
Kay was passed around
like a loving cup.

168
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,773
I can't tell you
how delighted I am.

169
00:07:55,734 --> 00:07:58,028
Buckley stood by
trying to look modest.

170
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:00,780
He only succeeded in looking
slightly half-witted.

171
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,286
I grinned and tried to join in,

172
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:09,080
but somehow there was
a fly in the ointment.

173
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:12,917
I couldn't put my finger on it,
but there was definitely a fly.

174
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:16,254
Yes, sir. That's the greatest
news I've had in years.

175
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,006
How about that, Grandpa?

176
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:22,594
Grandpa!

177
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,304
That was the fly.

178
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,348
Grandpa.

179
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,018
First he steals my daughter.

180
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,020
Now he makes
a grandpa out of me.

181
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:36,191
I do wish she'd go to Dr. Barns.

182
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,693
After all, he's taken care
of her all her life.

183
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,196
But I suppose this man
is alright, though.

184
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,823
Good gracious, November.
That doesn't give me much time.

185
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:45,825
And I have a million
things to do.

186
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,243
Ben? Tommy?

187
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:48,995
- What do you want them for?
- I want to tell 'em.

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,955
Ben? Tommy? Wake up.

189
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:54,334
Tommy, Ben.
Boys, do you hear me?

190
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:56,419
Something wrong?
What is it?

191
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:59,172
- What's the matter?
- The most exciting news.

192
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:00,840
Kay is having a baby.

193
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,134
Right now?

194
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,178
- No, silly, November.
- Poor Buckley.

195
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:06,596
"Poor Buckley?"
What do you mean, poor Buckley?

196
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,931
You wouldn't say that
if you'd been there tonight.

197
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:09,182
He was just bursting with pride.

198
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:10,892
We were standing there telling
him how delighted we were,

199
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,311
and he just stood there
looking sort of cute and shy.

200
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,063
Wasn't he cute, Stanley?

201
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,481
Cutest thing you ever saw.

202
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:18,316
Oh, alright, alright.
You're all alike, you men.

203
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,692
Good night, Tommy.
Sorry I woke you up.

204
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,569
Now night, Ben.
Go back to your book.

205
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,239
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Tommy.

206
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:28,701
Um, no need of broadcasting
this, you know.

207
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,544
Mrs. Dickson, please.

208
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,420
Ellie, what are you doing
calling people up

209
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,463
at this time of the night?

210
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:41,881
Will you please ask her
to call Mrs. Banks

211
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:42,882
the minute she comes in?

212
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:45,135
I have some very important
news to tell her.

213
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,678
Mrs. Dickson
would not forgive me

214
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,096
if I didn't tell her right away.

215
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,681
You know, I think
I'll give Kay a baby shower.

216
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:50,765
We could have it on a Saturday

217
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,016
and you could ask the men
to come in afterwards.

218
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:53,768
Ellie, do we really have to
blaze this thing

219
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,395
- from the housetops?
- Huh?

220
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,856
You know, after all,
it really isn't our affair.

221
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,274
Stanley, what's
the matter with you?

222
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,276
I swear you act as though
you almost didn't like the idea.

223
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,610
I don't!

224
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,779
Why, Stanley?
For heaven's sake, why?

225
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,865
I'll tell you why, exactly why.

226
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,741
In the first place, they haven't
got room enough for a baby.

227
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,909
The little apartment
they live in

228
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:12,162
isn't big enough for the two
of them, much less a baby.

229
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:13,788
Second place,
they can't afford a baby.

230
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,039
Babies cost money.

231
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:16,875
The older they get,
the more they cost.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,334
What do they think
they're gonna use for money?

233
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:19,419
You heard him tonight,
didn't you?

234
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:21,004
When I asked him if he had
the contract, said no,

235
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,255
but did that faze him?

236
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,506
Oh, no, no.

237
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:25,383
He just stood there
looking cute.

238
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:28,595
Cute? And he's the one
who's going to be the father.

239
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,762
Well, I'll tell you something.

240
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:31,681
If he's got any idea
that I'm gonna pay for it,

241
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:32,765
he's got another thing coming.

242
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:34,767
I just got through
paying for the wedding.

243
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,686
And another thing â€”
I think they ought to wait.

244
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,937
Wait? For what?

245
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:39,689
For seven or eight years,
that's what.

246
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:40,773
What do they know
about children?

247
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,066
My Kay is just a child herself.

248
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,151
Here she gets out of college,

249
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,153
marries the first guy
she comes in contact with.

250
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,529
Now she's saddled with a baby.

251
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,823
Stanley Banks, you listen to me.

252
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,034
I left school to marry you.
Do you remember that?

253
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,619
And do you remember
when we were married?

254
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:53,953
Of course you don't.

255
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:55,622
We were married
on the 4th of September.

256
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:56,915
What's that
got to do with it?

257
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,708
And do you remember
when Kay was born?

258
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,251
The 21st of June.

259
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,711
Exactly.

260
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:04,339
While my class was up there
on the platform graduating,

261
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:05,757
I was home having a baby.

262
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,425
Well, I don't...

263
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,679
Oh, Stanley, I-I-I know
they haven't money

264
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,182
and the apartment is small,

265
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,560
but those things don't
really matter, do they?

266
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:19,145
The important thing is that

267
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,105
we're going to have
a grandchild.

268
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,610
Darling, it's like
getting a dividend.

269
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,362
It's like getting a dividend?

270
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,865
Yeah, something comes to you and
you don't even lift a finger.

271
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,576
You have none of the
responsibilities of a baby,

272
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,203
none of the hardships.

273
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,538
All you have to do is love it.

274
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:44,671
Hello? Ruth? I have the most
marvelous news for you.

275
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:46,756
I am going to be a grandmother.

276
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,384
- "It's like getting a dividend."
- Yes! Isn't that divine?

277
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,677
Oh, we're so excited!

278
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,845
Yes, Kay told us about it
tonight.

279
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:57,308
Ellie didn't seem
to mind the idea.

280
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:01,145
Maybe women were different, but
when I thought a grandfather...

281
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,148
Why, I was the guy
who was going places.

282
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,984
The whole world of adventure
was waiting,

283
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:08,361
just waiting for me
to give it the nod.

284
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,488
And now a grandfather.

285
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,449
I thought of the other
grandfathers I knew.

286
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,743
Why, they were old, old men.

287
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,871
The toothless old codger
down the street.

288
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:20,581
That client of ours
whose only fun

289
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,166
was cutting people
out of his will.

290
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,004
Those ancient dodos
at the club.

291
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:27,547
You'd have to use a stethoscope

292
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,048
to be sure
they were still living.

293
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,510
I didn't belong with them.

294
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,262
I wasn't ready
for the mothballs yet.

295
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,597
Why, I hadn't even
begun to live.

296
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:41,686
Only trouble with me was, I
was a little out of condition.

297
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:43,604
I spent the next afternoon
in the gym.

298
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,926
Oh, that's fine.
Fine, thank you.

299
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,805
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

300
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,267
That evening
I felt like a million.

301
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,229
But the next morning,
I felt closer to 100.

302
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:34,197
Oh!

303
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:36,324
Oh.

304
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,577
Stanley, Buckley's here
for your golf match.

305
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:41,245
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

306
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:42,372
What have you done?

307
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:43,581
Oh, oh, oh, nothing.

308
00:13:43,706 --> 00:13:45,124
Here, here, here,
let me help you.

309
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:47,168
- Oh, no, no.
- Where's the pain?

310
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,169
It's â€” It's all over.

311
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,962
Oh, whatever did you do?
What happened?

312
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:51,756
I'll call Dr. Barns and get him
over here right away.

313
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:53,383
No, I don't want any doctor.

314
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:55,259
Stanley, for all we know,
it might be your appendix.

315
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:56,594
If â€” How could â€”

316
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,721
I haven't got an appendix,
and you know it.

317
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,848
- Well, I'll get Buckley.
- Buckley?

318
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,601
If I don't want a doctor,
I certainly don't want Buckley.

319
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:06,020
Well, I thought
he might be able to help.

320
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,314
Help? Don't you think
he's done enough?

321
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:11,150
All I want is a hot bath
with some Epsom salts.

322
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,985
Alright, I'll tell Buckley
and be right back.

323
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:14,237
Oh, Buckley!

324
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,447
Buckley. Oh, oh, oh.

325
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:24,038
The next week Ellie gave what
she called a "stork shower."

326
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,124
This is one form
of highway robbery

327
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:27,667
not punishable by law.

328
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,467
Kay! Kay, here's one here
you haven't opened.

329
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,469
Delilah, be sure
to keep all the cards.

330
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:39,637
Yes, Miss Banks.

331
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:41,180
Stanley?

332
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,308
Stanley, how wonderful
that you got home in time.

333
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,144
You should see
the things they gave Kay.

334
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:49,230
Everyone was so sweet.
They all brought her something.

335
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,773
What else could they do, honey?

336
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,817
Oh, Stanley,
you make it sound so sordid.

337
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,402
- Go on in. Kay's in there.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

338
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,695
That's no place for a man.

339
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,614
Hi, Pops!
Where you going?

340
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,366
Don't you wanna come in
and see my plunder?

341
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:01,826
- Well, I-I'll see it later.
- Oh, come on.

342
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,828
Stanley, when you're finished,
I have something very important

343
00:15:03,953 --> 00:15:04,954
I wanna talk over with you.

344
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,080
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Alright.

345
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,081
You just got to see.

346
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,749
The cutest things
I've ever seen.

347
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:21,512
Well, fine.
Now, I have to go now.

348
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:23,097
Oh, no, no, go over
and talk to Buckley.

349
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,557
He's just all by himself
over there.

350
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,769
Buckley looked like
a man going down

351
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,397
for the third and last time.

352
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,858
But I decided to let him
stew in his own juice.

353
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:35,234
I have to talk to Ellie.

354
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:42,158
Well, what do you want, Ma?

355
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,494
Alright.

356
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,790
I, uh, wanted to talk to you
before the Dunstans got here.

357
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
You know how worried I've been

358
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,419
about how we're gonna
rattle around in this house

359
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:56,214
after Ben leaves
for school in the fall.

360
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,215
Mm-hmm.

361
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,175
Well, I had
a wonderful idea today.

362
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,885
Uh-huh.

363
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,972
I say we ask Kay and Buckley
to move in with us.

364
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,516
Ellie, are you crazy?

365
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:09,644
Stanley, it'd be so simple.

366
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,064
We could make a sitting room for
them out of Kay's old bedroom

367
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,691
and knock through a door
to Ben's room,

368
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,527
and that could be their bedroom.

369
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:20,279
Then if we put Tommy
in the spare room,

370
00:16:20,404 --> 00:16:22,865
we could put connecting doors
from the bathroom,

371
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,202
and that would be the nursery
right next to our room.

372
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:27,870
We could even knock through
a door to our room

373
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:28,955
so if the baby crâ€”

374
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,957
Yes, that will be
getting nowhere, Ellie.

375
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:31,832
No.

376
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,751
Stanley, it won't cost much.

377
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,920
I had the contractor
over here today.

378
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,797
It's a perfect place
for the baby,

379
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:39,632
and the wonderful thing
would be that

380
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:41,300
if they wanted to go out
some evening

381
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:42,843
or even go away
for a week or two,

382
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,886
they wouldn't have to worry.

383
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,721
We'd be right here
to take care of it.

384
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:46,764
Now, look, Ellie.

385
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:48,641
I know how anxious you've been

386
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,560
to get your hooks
into that baby.

387
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:51,811
But the answer is no.

388
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,104
I've been all
through that, you know.

389
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,606
The 2:00 feedings
and the colic and the measles

390
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,817
and all the rest of it, and I'm
not going through it again,

391
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,777
especially with
somebody else's baby.

392
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:01,529
But it wouldn't be
like that, Stanley.

393
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,030
It would be fun
to have a baby here.

394
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,116
Yeah, you can go over and see
the baby at their apartment

395
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,784
when they get it all
washed and ironed,

396
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,869
but it's not coming here,
and that's final.

397
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,454
Well, you know that apartment
isn't big enough.

398
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,831
Alright, tell them
to buy a house.

399
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,207
They can't afford a house.

400
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,001
They should have thought
of that before.

401
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,504
I don't understand
how you can be so hard

402
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:21,257
on a poor innocent little baby.

403
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,677
Mom, Pops,
the Dunstans are here.

404
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:25,928
Would you please come out
and talk to them?

405
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:27,597
I gotta say goodbye
to the girls.

406
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:29,056
Of course.

407
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,560
Come on, Stanley.

408
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:40,568
Doris, Herbert, we were afraid
you weren't coming.

409
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,570
Well, well, Ellie.

410
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,904
Hello, Doris.

411
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:46,490
And how's Grandpa Banks?

412
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:47,825
Why? What's the matter?

413
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,827
Well, I'm a little stiff.
I've been taking some exercise.

414
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,495
Exercise?
Well, you're crazy.

415
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:52,830
Look at me, fit as fiddle.

416
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,582
I always say
the only exercise I get

417
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,417
is burying the men that take it.

418
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,086
Really, this baby's
the best thing

419
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,463
that ever happened to Herbert.

420
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,173
It's given him
a new lease on life.

421
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,800
- Sit down. I'll have Delilah â€”
- Oh, no, no, no, not now.

422
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,803
You sit down, Ellie.
You sit down.

423
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:09,263
Ooh, I beg your pardon, dear,

424
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,515
because I've got
something I wanna show you.

425
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:12,892
Kay, Buckley, come here.

426
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,352
I want you to see your present.

427
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,187
Here, take this out
of the way, will you, Stan?

428
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,563
Now, we're gonna
need lot of room.

429
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:18,814
Here you are, old boy.

430
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:21,692
- What is it?
- It's a blueprint!

431
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,486
Here, hand me that chair.

432
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:25,613
A blueprint for the future.

433
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,657
A blueprint for happiness.

434
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:30,034
Here now, Stan, just hold
that side down, will you?

435
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,119
And you hold
the other side, Ellie.

436
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,497
There now, you two kids,
take a look at that.

437
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:35,665
What is it?

438
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,292
- It's your new home.
- Home?

439
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,211
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'll tell you.

440
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,296
I was looking over our house
just the other day.

441
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,382
And it came to me
like an inspiration.

442
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,927
That whole west wing, it was
the perfect place for you kids.

443
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:50,680
So I called up my architect
and I had him come right out.

444
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:52,223
Here, let me show you.

445
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,685
Your own study, your own
living room, dining alcove,

446
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,770
kitchen and laundry,

447
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:00,815
and over here,
baby's room, nurse's room,

448
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,900
and master bedroom.

449
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,027
And it's all plenty commodious.

450
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:06,570
Ellie was fit to be tied.

451
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:09,073
She saw that baby
slipping out of her hands.

452
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:12,451
The living room is 26x22.
Is that big enough?

453
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:15,913
And best of all, you'll have
two babysitters ready made.

454
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,707
That's right.

455
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,709
Well, kids, how about it?

456
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,378
Why, it's wonderful,
isn't it, Buckley?

457
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:24,505
Yeah, yeah. Gee, Dad,
that's swell of you.

458
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,506
I'll get that tea now.

459
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,590
Now you understand, of course,

460
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:28,884
that there's nothing final
about these particular plans.

461
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,594
I just thought I'd give you
a general idea

462
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,012
of what it might look like.

463
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,306
Now, if you'd like
to have your entrance here,

464
00:19:34,432 --> 00:19:35,641
well that can be managed.

465
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:36,767
I'll call up the architect...

466
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,227
- What's the matter, Ellie?
- It's all your fault.

467
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,854
It never would â€”
would have happened

468
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,856
if you'd let me ask them here.

469
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,023
Ellie, I don't get it.

470
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,608
You're more excited
about this baby

471
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:45,818
than you were about any of ours.

472
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,278
Well, you don't understand.

473
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,113
This is the time
that Kay needs me the most.

474
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,449
I was â€” I was gonna take
so much off her shoulders.

475
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:53,451
I was gonna help her
with the shopping

476
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:56,662
and help fix the baby clothes
and fix the nursery.

477
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:59,790
Alright, alright, Ellie, if
it means so much, have it here.

478
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:01,292
- I don't care.
- Oh, it's too late now.

479
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,294
They're going to the Dunstans'.
We'll never see them.

480
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,338
Oh, Ellie, don't be silly now.

481
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:09,258
You heard what
Doris Dunstan said.

482
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:10,801
This baby was the best thing
in the world

483
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,636
that ever happened to Herbert.

484
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,472
To Herbert!

485
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:17,391
They're gonna take over
that baby body and soul.

486
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,351
- Ellie, this is ridiculous.
- Don't talk to me.

487
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:20,895
You're acting like â€”

488
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,736
It was so sweet of you.

489
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,112
So wonderful.

490
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,031
And we'll never be able
to thank you enough,

491
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:34,241
but I-it's really better
this way.

492
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,161
We'd â€” We'd only have gotten
in your way.

493
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:39,789
I'm sorry you went to all
this trouble and expense, Dad.

494
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:41,248
We should have told you sooner.

495
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,875
Have you already bought it?

496
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,920
Well, practically.
We made a deposit on Sunday.

497
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,588
- I see.
- What's this, Kay?

498
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,131
You got a house?

499
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:51,675
I didn't realize that you
were in a position to buy.

500
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:54,929
Well, yeah, we got
a mortgage from the bank.

501
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,347
A mortgage?

502
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,473
What's wrong with a mortgage?

503
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:59,308
I had a mortgage myself
until a few years ago.

504
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:00,643
Tell me all about
the house, Kay.

505
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:02,520
- Where is it?
- It's in the new development.

506
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,271
It's just darling,
isn't it, Buckley?

507
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,273
It's just big enough for me
to take care of easily,

508
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,983
and there's a nice backyard
for the baby,

509
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:09,777
and Bob and Bliss
are gonna buy out there.

510
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,987
- Is it furnished?
- Well, uh, no, it isn't.

511
00:21:12,112 --> 00:21:13,948
But we thought we could buy
some unpainted furniture.

512
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,867
Oh, you can't lift a finger.
You don't have to do a thing.

513
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,328
I'll do the whole business.
What's a mother for?

514
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:20,538
I'd like to know.

515
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:22,289
Ellie was off again.

516
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:27,837
For the next few weeks,

517
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,672
I'd stop at the new house
to pick up Ellie.

518
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:31,924
She was working time
and overtime.

519
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,476
Hi, Pops.

520
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,144
Hi, kitten.

521
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,815
Well, how are ya?

522
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,568
Wonderful. Come on in
and see what we're doing.

523
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:57,116
Oh, no, you don't.
You stay out in the air.

524
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,326
- I'm alright now.
- What's the matter?

525
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,578
Oh, it was just
the smell of the paint.

526
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:01,829
Well, it still smells.

527
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,873
Stanley, make her stay out here
while Buckley comes to get her.

528
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:05,332
He ought to be here any minute.

529
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,876
Let's sit in the shade.

530
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:09,211
I feel so guilty.
Mom's doing so much.

531
00:22:09,336 --> 00:22:12,089
Oh, nonsense. You know that's
the breath of life for her.

532
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,549
Where do we sit?

533
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:15,009
How about over here?

534
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,844
There?

535
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,345
How do you like the house, Pops?

536
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,681
- Oh, I think it's just right.
- Doris just loved it.

537
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,807
They said they never
would have moved

538
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:23,517
if it hadn't gotten
too small for them.

539
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:24,935
Hmm.

540
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,730
Oh, that must be little Bobby's.
I'll send it to him.

541
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:34,570
Pops, how did you feel
when you had your first baby?

542
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:37,281
Did it make any difference
between you and Moms?

543
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:40,117
I-I mean how did you feel?

544
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:41,535
Well, I felt fine.

545
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,120
I mean, really?

546
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,623
Well, I felt alright.

547
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:48,125
Well, I guess my nose was
a little out of joint at first.

548
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,127
I'd been high man with
your mother for over a year,

549
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:52,296
and then suddenly you came along
and took the spotlight.

550
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:53,672
You must have hated me.

551
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:56,258
No, no, I don't think
it was that bad.

552
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:58,844
I think the worst time
was the first night

553
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:00,012
we took you home, you know.

554
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,723
Yeah, I remember
we got you home,

555
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,851
gave you your 6:00 feeding,
got you bedded down.

556
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,770
Then we must have gone
to your room a dozen times

557
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,647
the next hour
to see how you were.

558
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,815
Of course, if you were quiet, we
went in to see if you were dead.

559
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:14,443
And if you cried, we went in
to see what was wrong with you.

560
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:17,363
I remember lying awake
that night thinking to myself,

561
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:18,447
"Now, what have we got into?

562
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:20,991
Here we were,
two perfectly happy people,

563
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:22,618
free as the air.

564
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,703
Now we're trapped.

565
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:27,623
Trapped by 20 inches
of screaming humanity."

566
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:29,458
Do all fathers feel that way?

567
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,543
I only know about myself.

568
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,797
I remember that morning
you â€” you woke with the dawn...

569
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,716
screaming your head off.

570
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:39,677
And your mother went in
to heat your formula,

571
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:42,596
and I went in to see what
I could do about quieting you.

572
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,059
And I stuck a finger at you,
and you grabbed it.

573
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:49,269
Grabbed it with such a grip.

574
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:53,649
From that moment on,
you had me hooked.

575
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:55,693
Oh, I hope Buckley
gets over there quickly.

576
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,486
You have to butter him up
a little, you know.

577
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:59,321
Make him think he's still
part of the family.

578
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,156
Thanks, Pops.

579
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,658
Oh, there he is.

580
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:04,243
Hi, honey.

581
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:07,955
- Hi, honey.
- How are you, darling? Ahh!

582
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,541
- Oh, hello, there! How are ya?
- Fine, thank you.

583
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,127
Well, what new wonders
did we accomplish today?

584
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,586
You're gonna see it tomorrow.
Take her along now.

585
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:16,547
- You'll be late for the party.
- Mom, Buckley can help.

586
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,382
There's nothing left to do.
Your father and I will lock up.

587
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,009
- Have fun.
- Well, okay.

588
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,511
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Stanley.
- Where you going?

589
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:24,805
Stan, come here.
I want to show you.

590
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:26,640
How do you like this green?

591
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:27,975
Isn't it a perfectly
wonderful shade?

592
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,351
- We're gonna use it in here.
- Fine.

593
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:30,519
And in the hall and every place.

594
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:31,729
It'll make the house
look much larger.

595
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:33,230
And the same thing
with the curtain.

596
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:34,857
I got the most wonderful
bargain today.

597
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:36,775
A Millen, look at that.

598
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,570
For all the windows.
And this is for the bedroom.

599
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,612
Just wait till you see
the price.

600
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:41,780
You'll be very proud of me.

601
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:43,240
I'm staying right
within their budget.

602
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,325
I'm having a marvelous time.

603
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,453
There's only one thing wrong.

604
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:50,622
I haven't done a thing
about the nursery.

605
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:52,124
I could cry about it.

606
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:53,333
What's the matter?

607
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,878
- Herbert's doing it.
- Dunstan?

608
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:57,713
He was so upset about
their not moving in with him.

609
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:58,797
He said the least they could do

610
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,090
would be to let him
furnish the nursery.

611
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,176
He's going to give them
a crib and a bassinet

612
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:03,677
and a screen
and a chest of drawers.

613
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,847
It'll probably all be done
in 14-karat gold.

614
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:10,225
What are we gonna give the baby?

615
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,769
Stan!

616
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:13,270
What are you so surprised about?

617
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:14,813
Didn't you think I was gonna
give the baby a present?

618
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:16,315
Well, as a matter of fact,
there was something

619
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,525
I was looking at today that
would make a wonderful present.

620
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,569
You put it right in this window,
and it keeps the air clean

621
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:21,820
and the right temperature.

622
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,572
It's very pretty
and modern-looking.

623
00:25:23,697 --> 00:25:25,657
- It's quite expensive.
- What's the name of it?

624
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,910
I don't know the name of it, but
it will only extend this far.

625
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:30,746
- Where did you see it?
- Downtown.

626
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:33,040
You see, uh,
you regulate it from here.

627
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,834
It controls the air and the
temperature at all times, see.

628
00:25:36,627 --> 00:25:38,420
No dust, no soot, no pollen.

629
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,214
- Hmm.
- Wonderful. Ellie's idea.

630
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,298
Wish we'd had one for Tommy.

631
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:43,258
He probably wouldn't
have those adenoids.

632
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:45,177
It is wonderful.
And look over here.

633
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:46,804
Come here.
I want to show you this.

634
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:48,013
Now, you see?

635
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:51,433
You turn it on and leave it here
beside his crib.

636
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:53,268
And then you can go out
and close the door.

637
00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:54,311
And if he cries

638
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,605
or even if there's any change
in his breathing,

639
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,190
you can hear it
from anywhere in the house.

640
00:25:58,315 --> 00:26:00,150
No. Hmm, well, they're
certainly gonna love that.

641
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,112
And here's his combination
bath and dressing table.

642
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:04,696
Right, just the right size.

643
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:06,115
What is that?
What is that?

644
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,242
Oh, that's mine. I thought he
might as well get used to it.

645
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,409
He'll going there someday.

646
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,786
- Oh, he will?
- Oh, yes.

647
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,663
As a matter of fact,
I've already registered him

648
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,248
in the class of 1973.

649
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,416
Mm.
I'm a Dartmouth man myself.

650
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,960
Oh, that's a good college, too.

651
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:20,087
Now, this bath, Stan, I want you
to notice the height of it.

652
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,755
A good college?

653
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,258
A good college?

654
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:31,181
We beat you in football in 1947,
1948, and 1949.

655
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:32,641
And we shall probably â€”

656
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:36,061
And we have defeated you
five years running in hockey.

657
00:26:36,186 --> 00:26:38,564
And our bobsled team
is probably the finest

658
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,440
that has ever been developed
in the history of the world.

659
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,359
Ellie's make some fresh coffee.

660
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:43,735
A good â€”

661
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:45,696
That's one of the funniest
remarks you've ever made.

662
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:48,782
Now, now, wait a minute.
No, no, now listen here, Stan.

663
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,993
And, you know, scholastically...

664
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:53,871
Well, what do you think
of our little nursery?

665
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:55,664
- Isn't it lovely?
- Fine, fine.

666
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,667
The wonderful thing is, most
of it can grow up with him.

667
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,169
The shelves, for instance.

668
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:02,004
It'll hold his toys now,

669
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:04,548
but later he can use it
for his tennis racket.

670
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:05,841
Ellie was right.

671
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:08,677
They had taken over the baby
lock, stock, and barrel.

672
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,721
- ... and things.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

673
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:12,973
Oh, thank you, dear.

674
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,516
Isn't that a beautiful
record, Pops?

675
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:15,809
Mm-hmm.

676
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,187
Mother Dunstan gave it to me.
She gave me the whole album.

677
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:20,772
I remember that I used to
listen to classical music

678
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:22,608
while I was waiting for Buckley.

679
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:25,402
I think that's why
he whistles so well.

680
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:27,112
Have you ever heard him whistle?

681
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,823
No, no, I haven't.

682
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,617
Well, you should
ask him sometime.

683
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:33,744
Yes, I will.
I certainly will.

684
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:35,287
By the way, son,
what are you going to call

685
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:36,121
this baby of yours?

686
00:27:36,246 --> 00:27:37,497
We've had some terrible
arguments about it.

687
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:38,498
Haven't we, Buckley?

688
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,292
We've gone through
all the telephone books,

689
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:42,085
the dictionaries,
the baby books.

690
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:44,838
Finally, we found a couple
of names we both liked.

691
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,090
Come on, sit down here.
Sit down.

692
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,760
Uh, if it's a boy, we thought
we might call him Andrew.

693
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,178
Andrew? Who's Andrew?

694
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:54,723
Well, there's a Andrew Jackson
and Andrew Nordell, my doctor.

695
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:56,892
And besides, we like
the name Andrew.

696
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,561
And â€” And we both like
the name Jonathan.

697
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:02,397
Oh, no, not Jonathan.
Better call him plain John.

698
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,400
Well, we also thought
we might call him Michael.

699
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:06,401
That's a good name.

700
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:07,736
Oh, you can't call him Michael.

701
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:10,739
I went to school with a Michael,
and he smelled.

702
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:13,116
Well, now, Ellie, just because
your Michael smelled,

703
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:16,620
you know, it doesn't mean that
all Michaels have to smell.

704
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:18,121
You know a name that I've loved

705
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:20,749
ever since I first read
"Little Women"?

706
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:23,502
Lauren, Laurie.
Remember how dear he was?

707
00:28:23,627 --> 00:28:25,379
How about Timothy?
I think that has everything.

708
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,047
Do you like the name
of Timothy, Kay?

709
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:27,965
Well, I â€”

710
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,591
Now, Ellie,
they've already told you

711
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:31,677
they've been all through this.

712
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:34,179
Why do we suggest
any more names?

713
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:36,431
Besides, the names
they have are wonderful.

714
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:39,601
Jonathan, Michael, Andrew,
they're all wonderful names.

715
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:42,938
But you have to think
of two names that go together.

716
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:47,109
Andrew Dunstan, that doesn't
sound very good, does it?

717
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:48,860
Stanley, they haven't
made up their minds.

718
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:49,987
They need our help.

719
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:51,238
If I may interrupt, I think

720
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:52,990
you're going about this
all wrong.

721
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:55,200
My idea would be
to use a family name.

722
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:56,451
Well, that's right.

723
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:59,579
The first grandson is always
supposed to have the name

724
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,290
of the paternal grandfather,
isn't it?

725
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,959
No, no, no. Now, Doris,
that's not what I meant.

726
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:06,295
I was thinking of
my great-grandfather Malcolm

727
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,255
or, we", say Uncle Wilfred.

728
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,132
Well, if we're talking
about family names,

729
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:11,466
what about Stanley?

730
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:14,219
Stanley Dunstan, that ought
to satisfy everybody.

731
00:29:14,344 --> 00:29:16,179
Well, we did think about that.

732
00:29:16,305 --> 00:29:17,848
No, no, no, no.

733
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:21,184
No, one Stanley
in the family is enough.

734
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,853
You're right.
Now, how about Cornelius?

735
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,813
That's a family name.
And then let's see.

736
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:27,858
There's Gregory and Dexter
and David.

737
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,902
I had some wonderful names
in my family, too.

738
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:32,904
Milo and Fennington.

739
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,199
Fennington, now, that's nice.
That'd be a nice name.

740
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:37,993
Fennington.

741
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:39,786
We're all talking
about boys' names.

742
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:40,787
What if it's a girl?

743
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,205
We've got to decide
on a girl's name.

744
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:43,999
Oh, it won't be a girl.
Don't worry.

745
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:45,500
The Dunstans always run to boys.

746
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,502
I'm not worried.
I want it to be a girl.

747
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:49,087
I like girls.

748
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:50,589
Where are you going, darling?

749
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,132
I thought I'd wash the dishes.

750
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,675
Oh, nothing of the sort.
I'll do them.

751
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,177
Mom, please let me go.

752
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,888
You do too much, Kay.
You must rest more.

753
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:59,014
Oh, I don't agree with you.

754
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:00,307
I think some work
is good for you.

755
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,184
I think she should have a maid.
I'd be perfectly willing â€”

756
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,561
Of course, I don't mean
she should work if she's tired.

757
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:06,188
It's this young doctor of hers.

758
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:08,774
I've always said she should
have gone to our family doctor.

759
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:10,275
We wanted her to go
to our doctor, too.

760
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,069
There's nothing the matter
with my doctor.

761
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,904
He's fine.
He's wonderful.

762
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,114
He told me not to pay
any attention to â€”

763
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,825
N-Nobody seems to realize
this is my baby.

764
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,577
Mine and Buckley's.

765
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:23,288
You seem to think
with the way you talk â€”

766
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:24,581
Well â€” Well,
I'll have you know this.

767
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:27,042
I'm going to have my baby
the way I want to.

768
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:45,394
Well, now that we've succeeded
in reducing her to hysterics,

769
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,062
what do you say we get out
of here and go home?

770
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:48,563
Oh, she's just high-strung.

771
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:49,940
- Where are your things?
- In the bedroom.

772
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,733
I'll get them.

773
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,193
Come here.

774
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,452
Oh, thanks.

775
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:03,453
Pops.

776
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:05,080
Uh, we're going to
run along, kitten.

777
00:31:05,205 --> 00:31:07,082
Please come in, Pops.

778
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:09,209
Go ahead.
I'll take their things.

779
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:14,840
- Aww.
- Oh, Pops, that was horrible.

780
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:17,551
I was terrible.
They'll never forgive me.

781
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:21,471
No, no, we â€” we deserve
much worse than that.

782
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:22,931
It wasn't you.

783
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,934
You never interfere, but â€”
but the others.

784
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,229
Mother and Father Dunstan
and Moms.

785
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,398
I'm doing too much.
I'm doing too little.

786
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,775
She wants a girl.
They want a boy.

787
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,110
No matter what the baby is,

788
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:36,611
somebody's going to be
disappointed.

789
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:39,698
Yeah, I think what you'll have
to do is have, you know, twins,

790
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:40,866
one of each sex.

791
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:44,035
Thank heavens for you, Pops.

792
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,537
You're the only one
with any sense.

793
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:47,581
Oh, no, no, I'm just as bad
as the rest of them.

794
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:48,582
But I'll tell you this.

795
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:49,958
There's going to be
no more of it.

796
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,042
It'll never happen again.

797
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:52,794
We'll never gang up
on you again.

798
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,129
Believe me.

799
00:31:54,254 --> 00:31:55,797
- Thanks, Pops.
- You relax, kitten.

800
00:31:55,922 --> 00:31:57,757
From now on,
it's going to be your way.

801
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,551
A-And you won't let them
make a fuss

802
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:01,803
with Dr. Nordell, will you?

803
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:02,888
What do you mean, dear?

804
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:04,639
Well, the Dunstans said
they were going down

805
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:06,183
to have a talk with him.

806
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:07,976
Oh, Pops, you won't
let them do that, will you?

807
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:09,478
Oh, of course I won't.

808
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:11,313
What nonsense.
He's your doctor.

809
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:13,482
You have confidence in him,
faith in him.

810
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:15,942
No one has a right
to destroy that confidence.

811
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,861
Thanks, Pops.

812
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,488
It â€” It isn't their fault,
really.

813
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:22,324
It's just that, well, I guess
they just don't understand

814
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:24,201
the new way of looking
at things.

815
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:26,870
Well, after all,
as Dr. Nordell says,

816
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:29,664
birth is a perfectly
natural thing,

817
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:31,458
a-a-a glorious thing

818
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,418
and want to be
conscious every minute

819
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,545
so â€” so they don't miss
a second of it.

820
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,714
He believes that a woman
should be aware

821
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,841
of the wonderful thing
that's happening to her.

822
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:41,343
And another thing.

823
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:43,220
He doesn't believe that
a woman should be separated

824
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,597
from her baby for one second
after it's born.

825
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:49,476
You â€” You should carry it
with you right back to your room

826
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:51,645
and â€” and keep it there
with you,

827
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,731
sleeping right there with you
in your hospital room.

828
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,858
That is a little new, isn't it?

829
00:32:56,983 --> 00:32:59,027
Oh, Pops, that's not new.

830
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:00,946
Primitive woman
has always done it.

831
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:02,614
Dr. Nordell was in the Pacific,

832
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:04,407
and he said the women there,
why â€”

833
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:06,826
why, they were never
separated from their babies.

834
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,537
They â€” They kept them slung
on their backs

835
00:33:08,662 --> 00:33:10,455
for the first two years
of their lives.

836
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,749
And he said it was wonderful
for the babies.

837
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:16,294
He said if he had his way, all
of his mothers would do that.

838
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:18,713
You'd â€” You'd carry them
on your back

839
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:20,090
while you were doing
your housework,

840
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,801
and then when it got hungry,
you'd swing it around

841
00:33:22,926 --> 00:33:25,720
and feed it and then
swing it back again.

842
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:29,182
He says it gives the baby a
wonderful feeling of security.

843
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:33,520
Hmm, uh, darling,
you're â€” you're, you know â€”

844
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,105
you're sure that this doctor â€”

845
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,399
Oh, Pops, you're not
going to start that, too?

846
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:40,402
No, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

847
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:42,362
Dr. Nordell is wonderful.

848
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,322
- He's marvelous. He's â€”
- Yeah.

849
00:33:44,447 --> 00:33:46,491
Well, he's simply
terribly wonderful.

850
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:48,159
Darling, I'm sure he is.

851
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:50,078
I'm sure he is.

852
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:51,871
- Kitten, I'm sure.
- Thank you, Pops.

853
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,916
Now, you â€” you just go to sleep
and relax.

854
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,960
Okay.
Good night, Pops.

855
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,170
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

856
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,437
Dr. Nordell will be
with you in a minute.

857
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:17,314
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

858
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,778
I just don't like the idea.

859
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:25,947
I thought we said last night,
the Dunstans and all of us,

860
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,407
that we weren't going to
interfere any more

861
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,284
in their affairs.

862
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,910
I'm not going to have
my daughter walking around

863
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,038
for two years
with her papoose on her back.

864
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:34,581
Darling, I tell you,
that's figurative.

865
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:35,874
He didn't mean that literally.

866
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:37,667
Hmm, just want to be sure.

867
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,176
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

868
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,803
- Good morning,
- I am so glad you came.

869
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:50,513
Now I've met the whole family.

870
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,849
Mr. and Mrs. Dunstan Sr.
were in this morning.

871
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:54,851
- Oh, they were?
- They were a little anxious.

872
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,353
Thought Kay was doing too much.

873
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:59,189
But I think I convinced them
that she was alright.

874
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,940
That's a wonderful
daughter you have.

875
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,318
- Thank you.
- Oh, excuse me.

876
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,445
- Won't you, Mrs. Banks?
- Thank you.

877
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:11,743
So, what can I do for you?

878
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:13,370
Well, as a matter of fact,

879
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:15,205
my wife has been
a little worried, too.

880
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,957
And you know how mothers are
at this time.

881
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,376
Only daughter
and all that sort of thing.

882
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:22,212
I thought the best thing to do
would be to bring her down here

883
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:23,380
and let her have
a talk with you.

884
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:26,007
I think that's very sensible.

885
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:28,176
What particularly
worries you, Mrs. Banks?

886
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,511
Well, actually, I â€”

887
00:35:29,636 --> 00:35:32,389
Well, actually, it's
the whole thing, isn't it?

888
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:36,393
Uh, I mean, about it all being
so natural and everything.

889
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,520
I'm just trying to take away

890
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:39,979
any fear she might have.

891
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:44,234
You know, the fear of pain
can really produce pain.

892
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:47,779
But if she understands
the whole process,

893
00:35:47,904 --> 00:35:49,364
if she has confidence in me,

894
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,199
if she knows that I'm going to
be right there with her

895
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:52,867
to help her when she wants help,

896
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:56,663
if she trusts me, that's
half the battle, isn't it?

897
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,164
Yes, it is.

898
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,584
And then afterward, having
the baby in the room with her,

899
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,128
I'm trying
to persuade my mothers

900
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:05,880
to go back to caring
for their babies themselves,

901
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:08,591
feeding them themselves,
bathing them,

902
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:10,135
being close to them

903
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,429
instead of handing them
over to some nurse.

904
00:36:12,554 --> 00:36:14,472
I know that this is a lot
to ask of your daughter.

905
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:16,641
It's â€” It's a full-time job.

906
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:20,019
But believe me,
the rewards will be great

907
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,564
not only for the baby,
but for Kay.

908
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:23,648
There you are, Ellie.

909
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:26,025
I told you, all of your worry
for nothing.

910
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,777
It's a â€”
Thank you, Doctor.

911
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:30,029
You were nice to give her
so much of your time.

912
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,489
It's to my advantage.

913
00:36:31,614 --> 00:36:33,116
If I have you with me,
then, believe me,

914
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:34,534
everything's going to be
that much easier.

915
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,119
Well, you certainly
have us with you.

916
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:38,079
Thank you very much, Doctor.

917
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:40,165
- You can count on that.
- Very happy to have seen you.

918
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,000
Come on now, Ellie, dear.
The doctor's busy.

919
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,126
Good bye.

920
00:36:43,877 --> 00:36:45,962
For the next month or two,
everything was peaceful.

921
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:47,213
Too peaceful.

922
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,216
I should have known it was
the calm before a storm.

923
00:36:55,221 --> 00:36:57,807
Ellie, answer â€”
Telephone, Ellie.

924
00:37:04,647 --> 00:37:06,191
Hello?

925
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:08,902
Hello â€” Buckley?

926
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,445
What?

927
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,363
Buckley, you know
what time it is?

928
00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:13,615
It's a quarter of 3:00.

929
00:37:14,574 --> 00:37:16,785
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

930
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:18,661
Is Kay there?

931
00:37:18,787 --> 00:37:19,829
Kay?

932
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,290
Why, of course she isn't here.

933
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:23,833
What would she â€”

934
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,252
Hello! Hello?

935
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:30,465
Buckley, I'll â€”
I'll take this downstairs.

936
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,925
Hang on.

937
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:53,655
Hello.

938
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,491
Now, what do you mean,
is she here?

939
00:37:56,616 --> 00:37:59,661
I thought if she were there,
I could come and pick her up,

940
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:00,995
if she were there.

941
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,915
When did she leave?
What time did she leave?

942
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,167
I don't know.
I-I've been out for a few hours.

943
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,836
I just got back
a little while ago.

944
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:10,338
What was it?
A fight?

945
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,091
Did you have a fight?

946
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:16,636
Well, we had an argument, yes.

947
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,264
Look, if anything happens
to her, I'll kill myself.

948
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:21,599
Don't worry.
I'll do it for you.

949
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,518
Did you look â€”
Did she take anything with her?

950
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:24,519
A bag or anything?

951
00:38:24,644 --> 00:38:26,896
She took her hat box
and her umbrella

952
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,274
and her toilet case
and her toothbrush.

953
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,484
Oh, we", don't worry
about it, then.

954
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,945
If she took a toothbrush,
she's not headed for the river.

955
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:37,699
Uh, did you call up and try
anybody else on the phone?

956
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,158
Well, you might do that.

957
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:40,869
Alright, I'll be right over.

958
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:54,549
- Any word?
- No.

959
00:38:54,674 --> 00:38:57,218
- Did you call her friends?
- Everyone I could think of.

960
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,888
The hotels,
and I can't wait any longer.

961
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:01,764
- I'm going to call the police.
- No, no, no, wait a minute.

962
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,807
No, don't do that yet.

963
00:39:02,932 --> 00:39:04,475
Maybe we can
figure this thing out.

964
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:06,728
- Uh, did she take the car?
- No.

965
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:08,938
Is there a bus runs by
at this hour?

966
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,607
Anybody you could think of
might have picked her up?

967
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:12,609
- I've covered the field.
- Well, then it must be a cab.

968
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:15,403
- What's the number?
- Fairview 6 â€”

969
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:17,238
Fairview 6-1-0-9-8.

970
00:39:17,363 --> 00:39:18,489
But there's no use asking them.

971
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,158
They told me they don't
give out that information

972
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:21,242
except to the police.

973
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:22,535
Fairview 6-1-0-9-8.

974
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,287
They said they had to
make it a blanket rule.

975
00:39:24,412 --> 00:39:26,706
There are too many wives wanting
to leave their husbands.

976
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,251
- She have much cash?
- I don't believe so.

977
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:32,587
I give her money,
but she keeps losing it.

978
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:35,757
Is this the first time
she's left you?

979
00:39:35,882 --> 00:39:36,799
What do you mean by that?

980
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:39,344
Oh, come, come, come, my boy.
I'm married, too.

981
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:41,679
Now, has she ever done
anything like this before?

982
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:45,808
No. No, she locked me out
a few times, but that's all.

983
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:48,519
Hello.
Hello, the Green Cab Company?

984
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,688
I know this is
against your rules,

985
00:39:50,813 --> 00:39:52,357
but I-I certainly
would appreciate it

986
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:53,900
if you could help me out.

987
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:57,528
Uh, did you get a call last
night from 324 Adam Street?

988
00:39:57,654 --> 00:40:00,281
Look, I told you once,
it's against rules.

989
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:04,369
Well, I'm not her husband,
you see, I'm her father.

990
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:06,079
And, uh, she's â€”

991
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,289
Well, she's, uh â€”

992
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:10,875
She's expecting, uh, you know,

993
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,753
and you know how they are
in that condition.

994
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,797
Sometimes they do â€”

995
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:17,590
If you could find it
in your heart to help me,

996
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,841
I certainly would appreciate it.

997
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,344
Well...

998
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:24,889
there was a call.

999
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:26,391
Where did you take her?

1000
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,186
Thanks, thanks very, very much.

1001
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,688
We won't forget this.

1002
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:32,689
Where'd she go?

1003
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:34,607
- Home.
- Home?

1004
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,567
Home? What do you mean, home?
This is her home.

1005
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:39,153
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I mean my home. Come on.

1006
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:40,989
I'll wait here.

1007
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:43,866
Do you want her to come back
or don't you?

1008
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:45,118
Yes.

1009
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,203
Well, then you'll have to
go and get her.

1010
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:48,788
That's the first law
of marriage.

1011
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,207
You can't expect
any self-respecting wife

1012
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,626
to come home
under her own power.

1013
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,890
I don't suppose you want to tell
me what the quarrel was about?

1014
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:10,351
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not talk about it.

1015
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:11,602
Okay.

1016
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,523
I don't know whether
you know it,

1017
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:18,151
but your daughter's
got a terrible temper.

1018
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,527
I'm sorry.

1019
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:22,196
And this business tonight,
why, it's like a child,

1020
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:23,698
and a spoiled child at that.

1021
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:24,824
She's got to grow up.

1022
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,284
She's got to be made to realize

1023
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:27,660
that she can't go
running home to you

1024
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,871
every time there's something
that she doesn't like.

1025
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,710
Well, what do you want me to do?
Pack up and move?

1026
00:42:30,473 --> 00:42:32,642
- Hi, Pops.

1027
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,195
Forgot your key, I suppose.
Why didn't you ring?

1028
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,822
Oh.

1029
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,575
I didn't want to wake up
you and Moms.

1030
00:42:50,993 --> 00:42:52,620
Anyway, I â€”

1031
00:42:52,745 --> 00:42:55,081
Doctor told me to sleep
with plenty of fresh air.

1032
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,250
Well, you certainly had your
share for tonight, I guess.

1033
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,584
Come on.

1034
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,963
First, I-I want you
to know this, Pops.

1035
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:03,506
I've left Buckley.

1036
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:05,258
I've left him for good.

1037
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,344
I wish you'd tell Moms for me.

1038
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:10,054
Ask her not to fuss.

1039
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:12,181
It's no use.

1040
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:15,268
It's over for good now.

1041
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,981
I'd rather not
have to talk about it.

1042
00:43:20,106 --> 00:43:22,358
Alright, kitten, it'll be
however you want it.

1043
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:23,818
You know that.

1044
00:43:23,943 --> 00:43:26,445
Come on, I'll have your room
ready for you in a jiffy.

1045
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:32,034
Oh, Pops, why did it
have to end like this?

1046
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,620
Everything was
so wonderful at first.

1047
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,790
I felt fine.
Everybody was so sweet to me.

1048
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:42,211
It takes too long, that's all.

1049
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,130
Drags on too long.

1050
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:48,134
I'm ugly now.

1051
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,385
I'm clumsy.

1052
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,929
Oh, darling.
Darling, don't say that.

1053
00:43:52,054 --> 00:43:53,806
Don't you know that
you have a beauty now

1054
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,641
that you never had before?

1055
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:58,394
I know what I look like.

1056
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:01,856
I'm dull and stupid.

1057
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:04,692
I can't do any
of the things I used to do.

1058
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:08,654
Now when I need him most,
I've lost him.

1059
00:44:09,739 --> 00:44:11,115
Doesn't love me anymore.

1060
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,284
Oh, kitten, you mustn't
think things like that.

1061
00:44:13,409 --> 00:44:15,870
He loves you more than ever.
He's frantic with worry.

1062
00:44:15,995 --> 00:44:17,747
Well, he just said to me
if anything happened to you,

1063
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,332
he'd kill himself.

1064
00:44:21,834 --> 00:44:23,252
What do you mean?

1065
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:24,795
Did he call you?

1066
00:44:24,921 --> 00:44:26,839
He's right out there now.

1067
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:29,884
Oh!

1068
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:33,304
I suppose he told you
everything.

1069
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:35,848
Didn't tell me anything.
Just that you had an argument.

1070
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:38,476
An argument?

1071
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:41,229
That's wonderful.

1072
00:44:42,438 --> 00:44:44,065
Do you know what it really is?

1073
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,026
There's someone else, Pops.

1074
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,237
He's found someone else.

1075
00:44:49,362 --> 00:44:51,239
He goes off
and leaves me every night

1076
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:55,910
and tells me he goes to
the office, but it isn't true.

1077
00:44:56,035 --> 00:44:58,204
I've called the office,
and he isn't there.

1078
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:03,334
He's in love with someone else.

1079
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:09,257
Oh, darling, don't, don't.

1080
00:45:09,382 --> 00:45:11,259
Please, don't, don't.

1081
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:15,137
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You've got to get your rest now.

1082
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:18,224
I'll â€” I'll send him away.

1083
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,767
I'll send him away.

1084
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:27,984
She's here.
She's been asleep.

1085
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,777
I wouldn't try to talk
to her if I were you

1086
00:45:29,902 --> 00:45:31,946
in the mood she's in now.

1087
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:33,739
Did she say why we had a fight?

1088
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,865
Yes.

1089
00:45:36,158 --> 00:45:39,829
Well, look, I'd like to say
something, just for the record.

1090
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:42,081
It's not true.
Not a word of it.

1091
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,083
I've been working every night.

1092
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,129
After all,
we're going to have a baby.

1093
00:45:48,254 --> 00:45:50,923
You know,
I-I want to give him â€”

1094
00:45:52,258 --> 00:45:55,303
She said that she phoned me
twice there, nobody answered.

1095
00:45:55,428 --> 00:45:57,430
Believe me, it must have been
just a few minutes

1096
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,140
I stepped out
for a cup of coffee.

1097
00:45:59,265 --> 00:46:02,393
I told her this again and again.
She won't believe me.

1098
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:03,561
Well, you ought to
have more sense

1099
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:05,146
than to argue with her
at a time like this.

1100
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:06,897
You know she isn't herself.

1101
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:09,859
Well, I'm not myself, either.

1102
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:15,448
Look, I even thought of having
a man call Kay and tell her â€”

1103
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:19,076
Then I said to myself,
"She doesn't believe me.

1104
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,620
She doesn't believe me
that I'm working like crazy

1105
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,831
night after night
for her and the baby.

1106
00:46:23,956 --> 00:46:26,334
She doesn't take my word for it,
then it doesn't matter."

1107
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,586
It's finished anyway.
It's off. It's finished.

1108
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:29,879
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1109
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:31,213
We'll all talk about this
in the morning

1110
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:32,923
when we've had some sleep.

1111
00:46:33,049 --> 00:46:36,010
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing more to say.

1112
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:38,512
May I use your phone?
I'd like to call a cab.

1113
00:46:38,637 --> 00:46:41,057
I'll drive you home just as
soon as I get Kay settled.

1114
00:46:41,182 --> 00:46:43,893
Thanks, I'd rather take a cab.

1115
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:45,311
Suit yourself.

1116
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:52,026
He's calling a cab.

1117
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:57,531
I suppose he denied everything.

1118
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:59,825
He told me his side of it.

1119
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,078
Well, you don't
believe him, do you?

1120
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:04,580
Darling, I only know
that he really loves you.

1121
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:06,332
Oh, that isn't true.

1122
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,666
He doesn't love me.

1123
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:10,544
He doesn't care
whether I live or die.

1124
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,880
Oh, I never should
have married him.

1125
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:14,507
A little late
to think about that.

1126
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,217
Uh, come on, now.

1127
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:17,885
You really must get
your sleep, darling.

1128
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,345
Come on, come on, now.
I'm gonna â€”

1129
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,430
Forgive me for interrupting.

1130
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,974
Your phone is out of order.

1131
00:47:24,892 --> 00:47:26,852
That's ridiculous.

1132
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,521
Out of order?

1133
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:44,370
Hello, hello, operator.

1134
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:48,582
You take him home, Pops.
I can take care of myself.

1135
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:49,959
Operator, opâ€”

1136
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,254
You're not supposed to
carry things.

1137
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:55,256
You know that.
I'll take 'em up.

1138
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:56,590
We don't need your help.

1139
00:47:56,715 --> 00:47:59,385
- Do we, Father?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1140
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,428
Here, I'll take 'em,
I'll take 'em.

1141
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:02,138
You don't have a room
for her down here,

1142
00:48:02,263 --> 00:48:03,722
some place you could
fix up as a bedroom?

1143
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:04,723
There's a couch
in the living room

1144
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,600
if she wants to try that,
find it a little hard, maybe.

1145
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:08,811
You know you're not supposed to
walk up and down stairs.

1146
00:48:08,936 --> 00:48:10,354
Another thing,
she's supposed to drink

1147
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,106
eight glasses of water a day.

1148
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,024
She forgets.
So if you could remind her.

1149
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,609
- I'll try.
- And her exercise.

1150
00:48:15,734 --> 00:48:18,654
Dr. Nordell wants her to walk
two to three hours each day.

1151
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:20,865
An hour in the morning
and an hour in the afternoon,

1152
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:22,324
and we usually take
a walk in the evening.

1153
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,118
And she's supposed to be
in bed at 9:30.

1154
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:25,911
- I'll try to remember.
- And the calcium pills.

1155
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,538
- Did you bring your pills?
- No, I forgot.

1156
00:48:27,663 --> 00:48:29,874
- I'll go home and get them.
- Won't it do in the morning?

1157
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:31,959
I'll give them to your father
when he takes me home.

1158
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:34,253
- Now, then, your shoes.
- Buckley, really. Buckley.

1159
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,213
You know you can't
do them yourself.

1160
00:48:50,686 --> 00:48:52,271
Oh, Buckley.

1161
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,273
Buckley, what's
happening to you?

1162
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:57,651
Haven't you heard?

1163
00:48:57,776 --> 00:48:59,361
We're having a baby.

1164
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:13,519
Stanley, Stanley.

1165
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,278
Stanley, time to get up.

1166
00:50:27,575 --> 00:50:29,201
Wake up, sleepyhead.

1167
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:44,300
As the days went on and nothing
happened, the tension mounted.

1168
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:49,054
Buckley watched Kay
as if she were a time bomb.

1169
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:51,390
That's a book.

1170
00:51:02,443 --> 00:51:04,320
Oh!

1171
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:05,988
What is it, Kay?
What's the matter?

1172
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:09,283
Oh, I reneged.

1173
00:51:09,408 --> 00:51:12,411
I had a heart
in my hand all the time.

1174
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,622
I don't know what
I must be thinking about.

1175
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:20,044
As November came and the great
event drew nearer and nearer,

1176
00:51:20,169 --> 00:51:22,296
we all waited
with bated breath.

1177
00:51:24,423 --> 00:51:26,425
- Is that the phone?
- No, dear.

1178
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,224
Well, I guess I'll get
a little air.

1179
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:40,522
- Stanley.
- Hmm?

1180
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,151
As long as you're going,
would you give this to Kay?

1181
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:46,487
Kâ€” Who said
anything about Kay?

1182
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:50,783
I never could fool Ellie.

1183
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:54,453
But I hoped I could fool Kay.

1184
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:04,088
- Stanley! How are you?
- Hello, hello, hello.

1185
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:06,173
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.

1186
00:52:06,298 --> 00:52:09,051
Is this a beautiful night?
Did you see those stars?

1187
00:52:09,176 --> 00:52:11,053
Mom sent me over with this.

1188
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,180
Oh, thanks.

1189
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:15,849
Go on, go on, open it up.
Open it up. Don't mind us men.

1190
00:52:18,727 --> 00:52:19,853
Let me take your coat.

1191
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:21,397
Oh, I can do it.
I can do it.

1192
00:52:21,522 --> 00:52:22,815
Well, at least let me help you.

1193
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,233
Alright.

1194
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:30,614
I'm glad you came by tonight.

1195
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:32,157
She's awfully low.

1196
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,952
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, she's just nervous.

1197
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:36,995
I wish you'd talk to her.

1198
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,081
- Oh, it's lovely.
- What is it?

1199
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:41,291
It's a beautiful bed jacket.

1200
00:52:41,417 --> 00:52:43,127
Isn't that pretty?

1201
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,380
Hmm. Ho-ho.

1202
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:50,008
You certainly are going to knock
their eyes out at the hospital.

1203
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:51,927
I'll go pack it right now.

1204
00:52:53,512 --> 00:52:55,389
Kay, Kay, now that your
father's here, you won't mind.

1205
00:52:55,514 --> 00:52:56,765
I'd like to get some cigarettes.

1206
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,183
You don't have to
run right along, do you?

1207
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,436
No, I can squeeze out
a couple of minutes, I guess.

1208
00:53:00,561 --> 00:53:01,729
I won't be long.

1209
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,607
Hold everything till I get back.

1210
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,737
You look wonderful, kitten.

1211
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,071
Oh, I feel fine.

1212
00:53:11,196 --> 00:53:13,240
It's just Buckley.

1213
00:53:13,365 --> 00:53:16,076
I wish you'd talk to him.
He's so jittery.

1214
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:29,298
What's he jittery about?

1215
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:32,259
Oh, he â€” he's afraid that,

1216
00:53:32,384 --> 00:53:35,137
oh, something will go wrong.

1217
00:53:35,262 --> 00:53:37,181
Oh.

1218
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:38,807
Shouldn't feel like that.

1219
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,353
Of course, I-I can't
tell him that, uh â€”

1220
00:53:43,479 --> 00:53:44,772
that it's going to be easy
for you.

1221
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:46,732
It may not be, but...

1222
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:48,942
But I do know this,
that when the time comes,

1223
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:51,487
you â€” you mothers seem
to have a courage

1224
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:54,323
and a strength
you never knew you had.

1225
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:56,867
I hope so.

1226
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,203
I hope so.

1227
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:03,165
As far as anything going wrong,
doctors and scientists

1228
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:04,875
have been working
for hundreds of years now

1229
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,585
so that you and your baby
can be safe.

1230
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,588
Nothing's going to go wrong.
You know that, don't you?

1231
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:12,424
I know.

1232
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,010
Oh, Pops.

1233
00:54:15,803 --> 00:54:17,304
I wish it was over.

1234
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:19,681
It will be soon, darling.

1235
00:54:21,433 --> 00:54:24,603
I'm sure that when you hold
your baby in your arms,

1236
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,147
you'll think it was worth
anything you went through.

1237
00:54:29,107 --> 00:54:30,651
Aren't I silly?

1238
00:54:30,776 --> 00:54:33,237
Like the first day
you took me to the dentist.

1239
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:38,367
Every night we put our clothes

1240
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:41,286
where we could grab them
in a hurry.

1241
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,871
We were like members
of a fire brigade

1242
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:45,207
ready to jump
at the first alarm.

1243
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,794
Well, it'll happen
almost any time now, huh?

1244
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:52,381
I suppose so, sometime within
the next two or three weeks.

1245
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:53,465
Two or three weeks?

1246
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,260
I couldn't live like this
another two or three weeks.

1247
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:01,682
Hello.

1248
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:05,644
Sorry to wake you, but I just
brought Kay to the hospital.

1249
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,062
Huh? No, I don't
know anything yet.

1250
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:08,230
The doctor's with her now.

1251
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:09,857
- We'll be right there.
- We'll be right there.

1252
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,951
Stanley, you can't do that.
You've got to really dress.

1253
00:55:21,076 --> 00:55:22,953
There's no telling how long
we'll be down there.

1254
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:24,955
Did you remember to put
the razor in your pocket?

1255
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,832
- The razor?
- Yes, your electric razor.

1256
00:55:26,957 --> 00:55:28,876
Then it doesn't matter
where you have to go to shave.

1257
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:31,503
And a green shirt.

1258
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:35,299
You should wake Tommy, please,
and I guess we better wire Ben.

1259
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:37,384
You can phone the message in.

1260
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:39,386
I must remember to tell Delilah

1261
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:42,014
to fix breakfast in case
the baby's born by then.

1262
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,724
Stanley, please hurry.

1263
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:01,950
What kept you?

1264
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:04,620
I'm just getting dressed.
I had to get my clothes on.

1265
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:06,288
- I'll drive.
- Oh, no, no. Here, come on.

1266
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:07,789
If we don't hurry,
the baby will be born

1267
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:09,666
before we get there.
Come on.

1268
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:11,543
The baby will be born,
and we'll never get there

1269
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,711
if you drive.

1270
00:56:24,056 --> 00:56:25,641
Don't go so fast, Ellie.

1271
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:27,559
We're in a business district.

1272
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,233
Ellie, slow down a little bit.

1273
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,152
Uh-uh! Uh...

1274
00:56:39,571 --> 00:56:40,822
Ellie, for heaven's sake.

1275
00:56:40,948 --> 00:56:42,282
I had the right of way.

1276
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:43,575
Keep your eye on the road.

1277
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,827
Your tie's on crooked.
Fix it.

1278
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:52,125
Ellie, gasoline.

1279
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:57,297
Come on, now, Ellie.
Pull over here. Let me drive.

1280
00:56:57,422 --> 00:56:59,299
- Come on.
- Stanley, be careful.

1281
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:01,551
No, no, no, Ellie,
you can't make it.

1282
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:02,636
There's a train.

1283
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:04,846
Will you relax?
You're making me nervous.

1284
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:11,228
You realize what you've done?

1285
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:13,438
You've broken every
regulation in the book.

1286
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,107
You've passed everything
on the wrong side.

1287
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,359
You've gone through red lights.
You've exceeded the speed limit.

1288
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,486
I know, but this
is an emergency.

1289
00:57:19,611 --> 00:57:20,821
For the first time in my life,

1290
00:57:20,946 --> 00:57:23,156
I longed for the sight
of a motorcycle cop.

1291
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:33,500
Park it, will you, Stanley.

1292
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:53,645
Oh, what's the matter?
What happened?

1293
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,482
Nothing happened.
It â€” It was a false alarm.

1294
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,526
I'm sorry we brought you
all this way.

1295
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:02,863
Oh, that's alright.
Nothing at all, nothing at all.

1296
00:58:02,988 --> 00:58:04,823
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

1297
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,742
- Good night, Kay.
- Good night.

1298
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:08,076
I'm sorry.

1299
00:58:31,683 --> 00:58:33,560
Is that your car?
The gray one over there.

1300
00:58:33,685 --> 00:58:36,229
- Yes, it is.
- Is something wrong, Officer?

1301
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:37,898
Yes, lady, there is.

1302
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:40,108
He's parked in front
of a fire hydrant.

1303
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:45,739
After a week, the strain
became too much for me.

1304
00:58:45,864 --> 00:58:47,783
I decided to take
a sleeping pill.

1305
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:10,430
Hello?
We'll be right there.

1306
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:11,515
What?

1307
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,683
It's already here.
It's a boy.

1308
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:16,061
He arrived
just half an hour ago.

1309
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,979
Huh, okay, he's fine.

1310
00:59:18,105 --> 00:59:20,607
The doctor says
everything's just fine.

1311
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:21,650
Yeah.

1312
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:23,485
That's wonderful.

1313
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:24,945
Wonderful.

1314
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:27,614
Give her our love.

1315
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,157
Give her our love.

1316
00:59:31,118 --> 00:59:32,077
Ellie.

1317
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:34,454
- Ellie.
- Hmm?

1318
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:36,289
Remind me to tell you
something in the morning.

1319
00:59:36,414 --> 00:59:37,916
Will you, Ellie?

1320
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:46,133
Tell me what, Stanley?

1321
00:59:46,258 --> 00:59:47,384
Tell me what?

1322
00:59:47,509 --> 00:59:48,969
Stanley, wake up.

1323
00:59:49,094 --> 00:59:51,471
Tell me, is it
something about Kay?

1324
00:59:51,596 --> 00:59:53,473
- Stanley!
- It's a boy.

1325
00:59:53,598 --> 00:59:54,975
Oh, Stan!

1326
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,853
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1327
00:59:57,978 --> 00:59:59,563
A boy.

1328
01:00:36,474 --> 01:00:39,352
I wondered if they
were crazy or was I?

1329
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:41,855
He looked as old
as Methuselah to me.

1330
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,190
All he needed was a derby.

1331
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:51,531
Oh, boy!
We'll be seeing you soon.

1332
01:00:51,656 --> 01:00:53,200
Yes, sir.
Look at him smile.

1333
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:54,826
Isn't he a darling?

1334
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,078
- Who do you think he's like?
- He looks exactly like Kay.

1335
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:58,038
- Oh.
- Like Kay?

1336
01:00:58,163 --> 01:00:59,331
Oh, I think you're
wrong there, Ellie.

1337
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:00,498
He's a Dunstan
through and through.

1338
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,293
- What are they gonna call it?
- It? Call him, son. Him.

1339
01:01:03,418 --> 01:01:05,837
I believe they're talking
about calling him Herbert.

1340
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,714
- Aren't they?
- I believe they are.

1341
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,217
Oh, Herbert,
isn't that wonderful?

1342
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:11,718
I hope you don't mind.

1343
01:01:11,843 --> 01:01:13,929
I mean, since you're
the maternal grandfather, I â€”

1344
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:16,181
Oh, no.
No, I should say. No.

1345
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,516
Matter of fact, I think Herbert
is just the name for him.

1346
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:21,019
Oh, well, I â€”

1347
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,437
I admit, he looked
a little better

1348
01:01:22,562 --> 01:01:24,147
by the time Kay got him home.

1349
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:27,192
- Perfect.
- Look at him!

1350
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:29,736
Did you ever see
anything so good?

1351
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:32,656
Did'ums have'um picture taken?

1352
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:34,115
When is he going to
be christened?

1353
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:35,283
In five or six months.

1354
01:01:35,408 --> 01:01:37,369
We want to wait
for Reverend Galsworthy.

1355
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,579
Come on, Pops, you have your
picture taken with the baby.

1356
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:41,331
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- We've all had our pictures.

1357
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:42,624
- No, no, not me.
- Come on, old man.

1358
01:01:42,749 --> 01:01:44,834
Oh, please, Pops.
Come on, just do it for me.

1359
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,419
I want a picture
of the two of you together.

1360
01:01:46,544 --> 01:01:48,088
Yeah, we'll sit him right here.

1361
01:01:48,213 --> 01:01:50,215
How about that, my boy?
Is that alright with you?

1362
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,384
He's smiling at you.
Hurry, Stan.

1363
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,261
Catch him just like that.

1364
01:01:54,386 --> 01:01:56,846
No, no, I don't â€”
I just â€”

1365
01:01:56,972 --> 01:01:58,014
There we go.

1366
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,516
Oh, no, don't give it to me.

1367
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:00,642
No, no, you sit down.

1368
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:02,769
Now go on,
smile at your grandfather.

1369
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:07,399
- See, it's no use. I don't â€”
- Turn him around.

1370
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,192
Turn him around
so we can see his face.

1371
01:02:09,317 --> 01:02:11,903
Come on, turn him around.
That's it. That's it.

1372
01:02:14,072 --> 01:02:16,241
Oh, see, it's a â€”
Look, look.

1373
01:02:18,576 --> 01:02:20,662
I-I mean, I-look â€”

1374
01:02:20,787 --> 01:02:22,914
Take him, please.
Please, take him.

1375
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,208
Oh, what's the matter?

1376
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,002
My goodness.

1377
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:28,586
Stanley, what'd you do to him?

1378
01:02:28,712 --> 01:02:31,589
What do you mean?
I didn't do anything to him.

1379
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:34,634
I think he's tired.
We really must go.

1380
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:38,054
By the way, Stan,
I had this made up for you.

1381
01:02:38,179 --> 01:02:39,973
It's a photographic
record of the baby

1382
01:02:40,098 --> 01:02:41,433
from the day he was born.

1383
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:42,809
Here, look at him here.

1384
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:46,021
And then wait, wait.
Take a look at that.

1385
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:47,647
And here, here.

1386
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:50,442
Isn't it amazing?
Well, he changes every day.

1387
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:51,901
Not to me, he doesn't.

1388
01:02:52,027 --> 01:02:54,321
- Coming, dearest?
- Here, put it in your pocket.

1389
01:02:54,446 --> 01:02:55,780
Show the boys, you know.

1390
01:02:57,115 --> 01:02:58,491
- Goodbye, dear.
- Good bye.

1391
01:02:58,616 --> 01:02:59,576
Goodbye, Stanley.

1392
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:03,288
Take good care
of our "gweat bid" boy.

1393
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,332
- Come, dear.
- Coming, darling.

1394
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:08,710
How about a "gweat big" drink?

1395
01:03:09,627 --> 01:03:11,838
- Pops?
- Yes, dear?

1396
01:03:11,963 --> 01:03:14,132
- Come in. He's quiet now.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

1397
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:15,425
Now, look, Kay, it's no use.

1398
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,344
Oh, Pops, it didn't have
anything to do with you.

1399
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:20,180
It's just that, well, there were
so many other people around him.

1400
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:21,514
It scared him.

1401
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:22,807
Come on.

1402
01:03:28,646 --> 01:03:30,815
Boy, he's gonna smile.

1403
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,026
Oh, come on in.

1404
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:36,196
See, everything's alright now.

1405
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:39,407
He's not scared anymore.
Is he, darling?

1406
01:03:39,532 --> 01:03:41,034
Now you've got a nice man here

1407
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:43,411
and you're gonna give him
a big smile

1408
01:03:43,536 --> 01:03:45,455
'cause you're a good boy.

1409
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,665
Now, look who's come to see you.

1410
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:48,958
- Who is that, huh?
- Well.

1411
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:50,543
Who is that?

1412
01:03:50,668 --> 01:03:53,421
Is that your grandfather?
Look.

1413
01:03:54,756 --> 01:03:57,717
Oh, honey, you terrible child.

1414
01:04:00,595 --> 01:04:02,055
What's the matter?
What happened?

1415
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,474
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
He just took a look at me.

1416
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:07,102
That's so funny.
He's such a good-tempered baby.

1417
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:08,561
The doctor said
he'd never seen a baby

1418
01:04:08,686 --> 01:04:09,729
with such a wonderful
disposition.

1419
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:11,064
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

1420
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:12,232
And it isn't because
you're a man.

1421
01:04:12,357 --> 01:04:14,692
He was smiling all over
the place at Herbert.

1422
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:16,319
Pops?

1423
01:04:16,444 --> 01:04:18,446
Well, now, come on.
Let's blow, let's blow.

1424
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:20,198
Pops?

1425
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,158
We've come to apologize.

1426
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:25,036
We want to say that we're
very sorry for being so rude.

1427
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,288
Now, you tell him
you forgive him.

1428
01:04:27,414 --> 01:04:29,791
Come on, now, honey,
give him a great big smile.

1429
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:32,335
Tell him how â€”

1430
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,963
- Oh, you little brat.
- Oh, it's alright, darling.

1431
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:36,631
He's gone now.
It's alright.

1432
01:04:36,756 --> 01:04:38,925
- The man is gone.
- Why do you do that?

1433
01:04:40,218 --> 01:04:41,511
You know what I think it is?

1434
01:04:41,636 --> 01:04:43,763
It's your tie.
If you just take off your tie...

1435
01:04:43,888 --> 01:04:45,432
No, Ellie, I'm not
going to take off my tie.

1436
01:04:45,557 --> 01:04:47,142
It's a perfectly nice tie,
and I happen to like it.

1437
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:48,393
It was present from Tommy,

1438
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,687
and I'm not gonna take it off
just because he doesn't like it.

1439
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:52,147
Oh, Stanley, the way you talk.

1440
01:04:52,272 --> 01:04:54,190
He's a baby,
an innocent little baby.

1441
01:04:54,315 --> 01:04:55,775
He doesn't know what it is
that disturbs him.

1442
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,069
He is not an innocent
little baby.

1443
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:00,697
He's an individual with very
definite likes and dislikes.

1444
01:05:00,822 --> 01:05:02,449
As an individual,
I respect his right

1445
01:05:02,574 --> 01:05:03,992
to have likes and dislikes.

1446
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:07,454
But I also reserve the right
to have a few of my own.

1447
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:10,248
From that time on,
I gave him a wide berth.

1448
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,460
It was live and let live
between us

1449
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:15,795
until one weekend
six months later.

1450
01:05:27,265 --> 01:05:28,433
This the Banks house?

1451
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,894
Well, yes, but, uh, whâ€”

1452
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:48,870
Hello! Thank you.

1453
01:05:48,995 --> 01:05:50,455
Good evening, Mr. Banks.

1454
01:05:51,372 --> 01:05:52,916
See you tomorrow.

1455
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:04,427
The thing I had feared
had come to pass.

1456
01:06:04,552 --> 01:06:07,847
He had invaded
the sanctity of my home.

1457
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:09,015
Hi, Pops.

1458
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,600
Hi, hi, Kay.

1459
01:06:11,893 --> 01:06:13,269
You have a visitor.

1460
01:06:13,394 --> 01:06:15,438
It's alright with you, Pops,
and you don't mind?

1461
01:06:15,563 --> 01:06:17,857
Oh, no, I'm delighted,
delighted.

1462
01:06:17,982 --> 01:06:19,317
He's nice, Pops.
Really is.

1463
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,152
It's just that, well,
you two got started off

1464
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,362
on the wrong foot, that's all.

1465
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:24,364
And I thought,
well, if I left him here

1466
01:06:24,489 --> 01:06:25,823
for a couple of days
alone with you â€”

1467
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:26,991
Alone?

1468
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,701
Well, I mean,
I won't be here myself.

1469
01:06:28,826 --> 01:06:30,036
I'm going to Boston.

1470
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:31,913
Buckley has to go there
and see Mr. Wellsford.

1471
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:34,749
You know, the chain store man.
And he asked me to come.

1472
01:06:34,874 --> 01:06:37,252
And I said I couldn't leave the
baby, but Mom said to go ahead

1473
01:06:37,377 --> 01:06:39,754
and that she'd take care.

1474
01:06:39,879 --> 01:06:42,048
Oh, Pops, I know
you're gonna love him

1475
01:06:42,173 --> 01:06:43,925
just as soon as you
get to know him.

1476
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,718
He has been a little strange.

1477
01:06:45,843 --> 01:06:47,929
Oh, there's my taxi.
I gotta run.

1478
01:06:48,054 --> 01:06:49,222
And remember this, Pops.

1479
01:06:49,347 --> 01:06:50,807
If he so much as
lets out a peep at you,

1480
01:06:50,932 --> 01:06:52,475
you have my permission
to spank him and spank him good.

1481
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,102
- Yeah.
- Bye. Bye, Mom.

1482
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:56,104
- Goodbye, goodbye, dear.
- Bye.

1483
01:07:00,525 --> 01:07:02,151
Stan, is that you?

1484
01:07:04,862 --> 01:07:06,155
Yes, it's me.

1485
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:07,532
The most wonderful thing
has happened.

1486
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,992
I thought you'd never get here.

1487
01:07:09,117 --> 01:07:11,953
Ah, ah, yes, Kay told me.

1488
01:07:12,078 --> 01:07:13,871
Oh, come up and see him.
Quick, quick.

1489
01:07:24,591 --> 01:07:26,926
Of course, we're not
quite organized yet.

1490
01:07:27,051 --> 01:07:28,636
Well, where is he?
I don't wanna step on him.

1491
01:07:28,761 --> 01:07:30,221
In your bureau drawer
over there.

1492
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,570
What is that?

1493
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,530
Well, that's my dress scarf.

1494
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:51,117
Well, what are you
doing with my dress â€”

1495
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:52,493
What?

1496
01:07:53,745 --> 01:07:54,996
What's going on?

1497
01:07:56,497 --> 01:07:57,915
Lookit here.

1498
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,542
What are you doing with my â€”

1499
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:02,337
- Stanley, what'd you do?
- Well, he's eating my scarf.

1500
01:08:02,462 --> 01:08:04,005
Oh, that's alright, dear.
It's clean.

1501
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,841
It can't hurt him.
Can it, my darling?

1502
01:08:06,966 --> 01:08:08,885
Did he have to be
in that particular drawer

1503
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:09,927
with all my shirts?

1504
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:11,679
I took the shirts out.
They're right there.

1505
01:08:11,804 --> 01:08:13,139
You can put them back now.

1506
01:08:13,264 --> 01:08:15,850
What a love-kins.
Who's a love-kins?

1507
01:08:15,975 --> 01:08:19,354
Oh, Stan, it's so wonderful
having a baby in my arms again.

1508
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:21,606
Who's a sweet boy?
Who's an angel?

1509
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:22,607
Look at the shirts.

1510
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:25,360
Who's going to sleep
in a nice big room, huh?

1511
01:08:25,485 --> 01:08:26,402
Is he going to sleep
in this room?

1512
01:08:26,527 --> 01:08:27,654
No, he's going to Tommy's room.

1513
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,614
- Where's Tommy going?
- Into Ben's room.

1514
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:32,158
I want him right here
so I can hear him if he cries.

1515
01:08:32,283 --> 01:08:34,494
You know, he's good, but
strange house and everything.

1516
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:37,538
No Mommy or Poppy, but he's
gonna be a good boy, isn't he?

1517
01:08:37,664 --> 01:08:38,665
Of course he is.

1518
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:40,291
I'm sorry I can't
go to the Dicksons',

1519
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:41,292
but you're going anyway.

1520
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,378
I phoned Ruth, and she's
delighted to have an extra man.

1521
01:08:43,503 --> 01:08:45,004
- It's all set.
- Yeah, well, I'm not going.

1522
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:46,839
- Oh, now, Stanley.
- No, no, no.

1523
01:08:46,964 --> 01:08:48,883
I'm not going without you.
They're your friends.

1524
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:50,385
Well, that's ridiculous.

1525
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,053
You can't eat here.
There's no food in the house.

1526
01:08:52,178 --> 01:08:53,596
Of course, there's
last night's clam

1527
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:55,098
if you don't mind
waiting on yourself.

1528
01:08:55,223 --> 01:08:57,183
- Where's Delilah?
- She's making up Kay's room.

1529
01:08:57,308 --> 01:08:58,518
Who's going to sleep
in Kay's room?

1530
01:08:58,643 --> 01:09:00,061
- You are.
- Now, look, look, look.

1531
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:01,813
Stanley, it's the only room
in the house

1532
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,356
where you can't possibly
hear the baby,

1533
01:09:03,481 --> 01:09:05,233
and I promised Kay
you wouldn't be disturbed.

1534
01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:07,860
Everything's ready, Miss Banks.

1535
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:09,362
Oh, good, and, Delilah,

1536
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:11,197
would you mind taking these
and sterilizing them?

1537
01:09:11,322 --> 01:09:12,448
You can use the canning pot.

1538
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:14,283
You don't have to tell me.
I remember.

1539
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:15,702
Mr. Banks,
isn't it just wonderful

1540
01:09:15,827 --> 01:09:16,953
having a baby
in the house again?

1541
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:18,454
Oh, just wonderful.
Just wonderful.

1542
01:09:18,579 --> 01:09:19,789
Just wonderful.
Great, great.

1543
01:09:19,914 --> 01:09:22,041
Let's get your foot.
That's a boy.

1544
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:12,860
All week I look forward
to Sunday morning.

1545
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:15,196
No alarm clock,
no train to catch,

1546
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:18,199
no office,
just uninterrupted slumber.

1547
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,794
I just had to let you see him.
He's so cute.

1548
01:11:31,963 --> 01:11:33,005
What time is it?

1549
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,465
6:00.

1550
01:11:35,299 --> 01:11:36,634
6:00?

1551
01:11:38,845 --> 01:11:40,429
Well, go back to sleep, dear.
Bye.

1552
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:41,764
Say, "Bye-bye."

1553
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:43,182
Bye-bye.

1554
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:49,355
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1555
01:11:51,023 --> 01:11:52,400
Sunday afternoon,
I had counted on

1556
01:11:52,525 --> 01:11:54,569
a good 18 holes of golf.

1557
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:57,029
But Ellie thought the baby
and I should get together.

1558
01:12:01,492 --> 01:12:03,995
45 minutes later,
he finally corked off.

1559
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:39,739
Hey, hey, hey.

1560
01:12:39,864 --> 01:12:41,407
Here's your ball.

1561
01:13:15,274 --> 01:13:16,817
Hey, wait, you tripped me!

1562
01:13:16,943 --> 01:13:19,111
- I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

1563
01:13:19,236 --> 01:13:22,031
Here, here, here, here.
Boys, boys, boys, boys.

1564
01:13:22,156 --> 01:13:23,282
Boys!

1565
01:13:23,407 --> 01:13:24,784
Stop, stop, stop. Hey!

1566
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:26,744
Come on, now, let's get over
there and let's do it right.

1567
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,413
Come on. What kind of a game
are you playing?

1568
01:13:30,414 --> 01:13:33,626
They were nice kids.
I was having a good time.

1569
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:35,252
Look, come on.
Choose sides.

1570
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,522
- Thanks a lot.
- Well, thank you.

1571
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:55,982
You wanna watch that dribble,
get that...

1572
01:13:56,107 --> 01:13:58,150
It was a good game.

1573
01:13:58,275 --> 01:14:00,778
I was wondering whether or not
to tell Ellie about it.

1574
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:02,405
She'd probably think
I was crazy

1575
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,281
playing ball with
a lot of kids.

1576
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:36,939
Where do you think
you're going with it?

1577
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:39,942
I'm â€” I'm sorry.

1578
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,083
I suddenly thought maybe
Ellie came and got him.

1579
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,558
I didn't take the train.
I flew.

1580
01:15:12,683 --> 01:15:14,727
I got so homesick for the baby.

1581
01:15:14,852 --> 01:15:16,896
Where is the baby?
Shouldn't he be home by now?

1582
01:15:17,021 --> 01:15:17,980
Don't you worry.

1583
01:15:18,105 --> 01:15:19,565
He's with your father,
so he's alright.

1584
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,025
You should see your father..

1585
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:36,040
Hey!

1586
01:15:38,876 --> 01:15:40,044
Police station.

1587
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,629
Hurry up.

1588
01:15:48,594 --> 01:15:50,888
Hello, hello?
Is anybody here?

1589
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,057
Anybody here?
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

1590
01:15:54,725 --> 01:15:57,103
Officer, Officer, has anybody
turned in a baby here?

1591
01:15:57,228 --> 01:15:58,312
I've lost a baby.

1592
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:07,530
Is it your baby?

1593
01:16:07,655 --> 01:16:09,031
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's my daughter's baby.

1594
01:16:09,156 --> 01:16:10,783
- It's my grandson.
- Where'd you lose him?

1595
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:11,867
I-I lost him in the park.

1596
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:13,786
He was in the park
in his carriage.

1597
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:14,870
I left him for a second.

1598
01:16:14,995 --> 01:16:16,789
When I came back he was gone
and the carriage was gone.

1599
01:16:16,914 --> 01:16:18,082
You say you only left him
for a second, eh?

1600
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:19,792
Well, maybe a minute.
I don't know, five minutes.

1601
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:21,168
You know,
some kids were playing soccer.

1602
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:22,837
And I went to watch them,
got kind of interested.

1603
01:16:22,962 --> 01:16:24,839
And you forgot your grandchild.

1604
01:16:24,964 --> 01:16:26,590
Well, I guess I did
for the minute.

1605
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,634
That's fine.
That's wonderful.

1606
01:16:28,759 --> 01:16:30,928
They give you a child to mind,
and you run off and forget him.

1607
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,972
What's the matter, Jack?
You losing your marbles?

1608
01:16:33,097 --> 01:16:34,890
Now, wait a minute.
This kind of talk is â€”

1609
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:37,143
Do you â€” Did you
understand what I said?

1610
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:39,478
A baby has been lost.
A little baby has â€”

1611
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:40,938
Why don't you do what
you're supposed to do?

1612
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:42,481
Do something.
Get on the television.

1613
01:16:42,606 --> 01:16:44,817
Tell the typer, whatever you do.
Describe the baby.

1614
01:16:44,942 --> 01:16:46,986
He's five months â€”
six months old.

1615
01:16:47,111 --> 01:16:49,822
Wearing a little white â€”
You know what babies wear.

1616
01:16:49,947 --> 01:16:53,492
He's got â€” got on
a little cap, I think.

1617
01:16:53,617 --> 01:16:54,910
Would you know what
color his eyes are?

1618
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:57,705
Brown. Brown. Brown. Blue.
I-I don't know.

1619
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:59,832
But you are sure it's a boy.

1620
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,168
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.

1621
01:17:02,293 --> 01:17:04,086
You haven't said anything to me
I haven't said to myself.

1622
01:17:04,211 --> 01:17:05,671
My daughter's home now
waiting for the baby.

1623
01:17:05,796 --> 01:17:07,089
I don't know what to do.
I'm going crazy.

1624
01:17:07,214 --> 01:17:08,257
I'll â€” I'll do anything.

1625
01:17:08,382 --> 01:17:11,135
Look, I'll have a big reward,
whatever, whatever I have to do

1626
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,261
if you'll just help me.

1627
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:14,847
Well, it just so happens
we picked up your baby.

1628
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:16,015
Oh, thank God.

1629
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,558
But it wasn't any five minutes
you were gone.

1630
01:17:17,683 --> 01:17:19,268
It was nearer a half an hour.

1631
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:21,520
Yes, sir.

1632
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:23,063
- Where is he? In here?
- Yeah.

1633
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:24,565
Just a minute.

1634
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:25,733
What's your daughter's
phone number?

1635
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:26,901
I'm gonna call her up and check.

1636
01:17:27,026 --> 01:17:28,444
Oh, no, don't do that.
Don't, please.

1637
01:17:28,569 --> 01:17:30,321
Please don't do it.
Don't do it. You don't know.

1638
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,865
I couldn't stand it.
I couldn't face my daughter.

1639
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:35,242
Please, I promise you, I'll do
anything if you give me the kid.

1640
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:37,161
I'll take him right home.
I won't stop anywhere.

1641
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:39,246
I promise you.

1642
01:17:39,371 --> 01:17:41,332
Well, I'll talk it over
with the boys.

1643
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,335
They've taken quite
a fancy to this kid.

1644
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,128
If they get any idea
you weren't treating him right,

1645
01:17:46,253 --> 01:17:48,005
you'd never get
out of here alive.

1646
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,300
Alright, boys,
they've come for him.

1647
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:56,931
I dreaded the moment
when he'd see me.

1648
01:17:57,056 --> 01:18:00,351
I knew if he started to cry,
I was cooked.

1649
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:04,021
I said a little prayer, "Don't
let him cry just this once.

1650
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,689
Don't let him cry."

1651
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:11,904
Come on, son, we're going home.

1652
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:19,078
Come on! Whoa!

1653
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:22,581
Well, that's my boy.

1654
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:24,375
That's my boy.

1655
01:18:27,378 --> 01:18:29,838
From that time on,
I was his pigeon.

1656
01:18:43,978 --> 01:18:46,772
Yes, yes!

1657
01:18:46,897 --> 01:18:49,108
The day of the baby's
christening came at last.

1658
01:18:49,233 --> 01:18:50,526
He was the center
of a little world.

1659
01:18:50,651 --> 01:18:52,861
His grandparents, his parents,
and his godparents,

1660
01:18:52,987 --> 01:18:56,073
all of us gathered together
for the solemn occasion.

1661
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:57,992
I couldn't help feeling
we were ganging up on him,

1662
01:18:58,117 --> 01:19:01,620
pinning the name of Herbert
on a poor, defenseless child.

1663
01:19:01,745 --> 01:19:04,164
"Suffer the little children
to come unto me

1664
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,916
and forbid them not.

1665
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,460
For of such is
the kingdom of God."

1666
01:19:08,585 --> 01:19:10,963
Funny how I had resented
the very idea of him

1667
01:19:11,088 --> 01:19:13,090
when Kay first told us.

1668
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,592
I was furious at both of them.

1669
01:19:16,468 --> 01:19:18,220
Making me grandfather.

1670
01:19:18,345 --> 01:19:20,973
It seemed to spell
the end of my life.

1671
01:19:21,098 --> 01:19:23,642
Now I couldn't imagine
life without him.

1672
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:26,979
our heavenly Father
now and forever more.

1673
01:19:27,104 --> 01:19:28,397
Amen.

1674
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:32,318
We were coming
to his big moment.

1675
01:19:32,443 --> 01:19:34,778
We all watched him
with bated breath.

1676
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:39,616
How would he behave
when the Reverend Galsworthy

1677
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:40,868
took him in his arms?

1678
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:43,245
Would he be terrified?
Would he cry?

1679
01:19:43,954 --> 01:19:45,456
Not that baby.

1680
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:47,124
To him the Reverend Galsworthy

1681
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,501
was just another face
to be explored.

1682
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:02,181
Name this child.

1683
01:20:03,349 --> 01:20:05,684
Stanley Banks.

1684
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,740
Stanley Banks,

1685
01:20:19,865 --> 01:20:24,828
I baptize thee in the name
of the Father,

1686
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:28,290
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

1687
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,043
Amen.

1688
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:36,090
We receive this child in the
congregation of Christ's flock.

1689
01:20:36,215 --> 01:20:38,258
And do sign him
with the sign of...

1690
01:20:38,384 --> 01:20:41,470
Stanley Banks, my grandchild.

1691
01:20:42,679 --> 01:20:44,681
My first grandchild.
