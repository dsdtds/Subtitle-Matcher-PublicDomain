1
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,295
We've given her an injection.
She's not in pain.

2
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,321
Is she asleep?

3
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,753
We can't tell.
She called out for her mother.

4
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:57,045
I've let her know. She hasn't come back.

5
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,711
Is she going to pull through?

6
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,503
We'll attempt the operation
when the professor arrives.

7
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,211
Success is one in every hundred.

8
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:06,295
Please excuse me.

9
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,003
Madame.

10
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:11,461
I'd like to be with her.

11
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:13,628
In case she...

12
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,295
Of course, go ahead.
She might not recognize you.

13
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:48,420
It's not possible.

14
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:51,753
Dora.

15
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:54,795
It's not possible.

16
00:03:57,128 --> 00:03:58,503
No, I don't want this.

17
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:05,003
It's not possible.

18
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:10,003
PLEASE SEE THE CHARGE NURSE.

19
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,170
You can't stay here.

20
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,253
You can leave.

21
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:41,503
You can leave. I have permission.

22
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,170
From the head nurse?

23
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:45,753
Yes.

24
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:53,336
The bell is there if you need it.

25
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,795
My dear?

26
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:00,378
My poor dear.

27
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,795
Are you the husband?

28
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,295
Yes.

29
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:06,670
What a shame.

30
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,003
She was young.

31
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,503
She was?

32
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:14,545
Dora.

33
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:23,461
Dora, you're not going to die!

34
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,586
It's not true. Don't leave me.

35
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,295
You're all I have, Dora.
I've got nothing left.

36
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,836
I've only got you. Don't leave me.

37
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,378
I want to start all over again. With you.

38
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,795
Not all alone.

39
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:36,211
Not all alone.

40
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,045
You can't die.

41
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,336
I love you too much.

42
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:49,586
We're going to save you.

43
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:53,503
What would I do
if you weren't here anymore?

44
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:55,586
What would I do?

45
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,670
You're warm, my dear.

46
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,003
I can't do anything for you.

47
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:13,836
I'd like to...

48
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,420
Nothing.

49
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:43,878
What will I become if you die?

50
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,836
I love you, Dora.

51
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,211
I love you.

52
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,711
It can't end.

53
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,420
It can't.

54
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,836
It's stupid.

55
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,003
A stupid accident.

56
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,420
Why you?

57
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,753
The driver got out unscathed. Why you?

58
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,170
He's old, he could die!

59
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,336
It had to be you...

60
00:07:26,586 --> 00:07:29,045
I shouldn't have let you go out just now.

61
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,753
- They always say that afterwards.
- Goodbye.

62
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,420
I couldn't have known.

63
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,336
My poor dear.

64
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,253
It's been too hard for you.

65
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,420
I understand, you've suffered too much.

66
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,920
It was the end for us.

67
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,045
It was the end.

68
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,211
Everything was ruined.

69
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,128
- We had nothing left.
- Drive on!

70
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,211
Nothing left.

71
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:12,295
- I'm keeping this one.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:08:27,378 --> 00:08:29,878
That was the last time I saw you, Dora.

73
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,545
I can't watch that. I'm going to mother's.

74
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,295
- Goodbye.
- Despite everything, you smiled.

75
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,086
You've been so brave, Dora.

76
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:58,878
Always.

77
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:01,670
In Neuilly.

78
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:03,670
The street.

79
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
The first time I took you there.

80
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,920
Were you able to pay
for the whole thing at once?

81
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:11,545
No, of course not. I signed loan papers.

82
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:17,336
And the horses, the buildings, are yours?

83
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,711
- Everything?
- Yes.

84
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:21,253
And you, my dear, said nothing.
You just smiled.

85
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:23,378
- Well, then.
- You were happy.

86
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,211
That shows wealth.

87
00:09:26,586 --> 00:09:28,045
Ah, you must be happy.

88
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:31,086
Not quite yet, actually.

89
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,503
You will be soon.

90
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:35,920
Stay cheerful!

91
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,253
You always went on at me
for not being cheerful.

92
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,045
I'm not so young anymore, you know.

93
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:51,211
At my age, you don't laugh
as much as at yours.

94
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,961
Be cheerful.

95
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,503
That always comes back to me.

96
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,795
Even at the start,
when everything was good.

97
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:59,711
Your heels, lower your heels.

98
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:01,795
In step, stay in step!

99
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:05,628
Excellent! Ribbons on the right.

100
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,711
Let's see! Your heels, Mr. Guy.

101
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:12,836
Smile, you need to be more likable.

102
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,711
Come on, your grip, let's see! Your heels.

103
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,878
Keep the reigns low.

104
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:23,670
Robert!

105
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,378
I'm heading out to my mother's.

106
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:40,336
What's wrong?

107
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,753
Nothing. Everything is fine.
Better than fine.

108
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:44,086
I love you.

109
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,045
Well...

110
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,503
Don't make that face, then.

111
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:54,628
You're losing your hair.

112
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,628
Careful, with your sad air,
you'll look ugly.

113
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,128
You laughed.

114
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,086
I would hear your laugh.

115
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:07,378
You'll laugh again, Dora,
like you used to laugh.

116
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,295
Again. Aren't you scared? Oh!

117
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,295
Oh, it's nothing. Stay there.

118
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,378
Mind the stirrups.

119
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:28,045
- Bertrand, 2400.
- Bertrand, 2400.

120
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:32,586
- Brissel, 6700.
- Brissel, 6700.

121
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,253
Charpentier, 4000.

122
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:38,170
I'm off to the cinema with mother.
Oh, I've got no money.

123
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,378
Good evening!
I might keep her for a while.

124
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:52,211
I always wondered
why Louis didn't like you.

125
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,503
I believe he thought
that you spent too much.

126
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:58,670
Back then, it wasn't anything.
You could have taken it all.

127
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,420
I would have liked to give you more.

128
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,586
Everything was for you.

129
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,128
I'll make it, Dora.

130
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,545
If you get better, I'll make it.

131
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,961
As much as you want.

132
00:12:12,586 --> 00:12:14,045
You won't want for anything.

133
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,920
Never again.

134
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:17,961
I need to hurry up. I've got a fitting.

135
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:20,170
- Shall I drive you?
- You got the Chrysler?

136
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:22,670
This morning. It's fantastic.

137
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,295
Darling,
you took everything too much to heart.

138
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,795
Your eyes, the first time I told you
I wasn't able to pay the loan.

139
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:37,295
Are things that bad?

140
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:38,780
Yes.

141
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:41,795
I didn't dare tell you
just how bad things were.

142
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:44,461
But I fought.

143
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:46,378
I did, but...

144
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:48,795
It all went so fast.

145
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
The accounts.

146
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,170
The bills.

147
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,253
The loans.

148
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:58,295
Bills, deadlines, taxes, loans.

149
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,503
Selling off the first horse.

150
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:09,420
Louis' grief.

151
00:13:10,128 --> 00:13:11,128
His complaints.

152
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:13,003
Emile's accident.

153
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,045
What happened?

154
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,253
Nana did it.
It just happened. She doesn't like him.

155
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:21,503
Is he insured?

156
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,128
He's not even on the books.

157
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,378
All that cost.

158
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:27,295
And you tried to help me
however you could, poor darling.

159
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:29,211
A wife, three kids.

160
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:31,753
That's a bad blow for us.

161
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,586
Thank you.

162
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:44,211
Since you'll have to replace him,

163
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:47,045
mother knows someone
who's a very good rider.

164
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:50,045
- Really very good.
- Tell her to send him tomorrow morning.

165
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,170
Dora, my dear.

166
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,878
You have been so kind.

167
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,170
You've worked hard.

168
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,920
You didn't worry about anything.

169
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:01,086
You were interested in the riding school.

170
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,878
A little more supple, madam.
And watch your hands.

171
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:05,336
Good.

172
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
- I should have listened to you more.
- Are you happy with him?

173
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,086
Not worth losing Émile, of course,
but he's not bad.

174
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,753
We're not in a position
to be too difficult.

175
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,920
You should thank mother.

176
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,336
You, who never wanted to
speak to the clients,

177
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:23,253
you became so pleasant
in order to try to keep some of them.

178
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,045
You even started riding again,

179
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:39,128
even though you didn't like it very much.

180
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:55,003
You accompanied them to the woods
when they asked you.

181
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,628
Deep down, I didn't like that.

182
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,670
I told you once. Please forgive me.

183
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:04,711
You're mad
if you think I actually enjoy it.

184
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:06,753
You were right not to be angry with me.

185
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,795
You were right about the girls as well.

186
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:11,211
I had so many troubles.

187
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,128
- Get on the horse!
- No, I'm scared!

188
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:19,003
Let that go now! Come on, back down.

189
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,295
Oh! Come on, let's go. Move forward.

190
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,170
- Are you holding on?
- No, I'm scared!

191
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:26,086
What on earth is going on?
What's all this?

192
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,878
I'm letting out the center to them
for two hours a day.

193
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,628
They're rehearsing.

194
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,961
- Are you going to see your other clients?
- Yes.

195
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,295
The others let me go.

196
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:38,461
It's horrendous!

197
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:40,878
In any case, I couldn't cope anymore.

198
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:44,670
I already knew that it was over.

199
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,920
The night of your birthday,
I knew it then.

200
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:48,753
I didn't want to tell you anything.

201
00:15:48,836 --> 00:15:51,045
I had already sold one horse
the day before.

202
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:54,170
That's how I was able
to buy you that little ring.

203
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,586
You didn't know.

204
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,586
It was stupid. I was scared.

205
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:01,545
Your mother was worried as well.

206
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,170
I don't understand. What's she doing?

207
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:05,920
You were lost in the woods.

208
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,045
Like a little girl.

209
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:10,795
That evening,
you made yourself act cheerfully.

210
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,211
Thank you for that.

211
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,586
I love you, Dora.

212
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,670
You could never know
just how much you mean to me.

213
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:21,045
I'm not handsome.

214
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:22,628
I'm not cheerful.

215
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,795
Five years of prison behind me.

216
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,795
You deserved better than that.

217
00:16:26,878 --> 00:16:28,670
But you accepted me.

218
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,503
I love you.

219
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,961
I love you, my dear.

220
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:35,003
When I finally had to tell you,

221
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,545
I would rather have died, Dora.

222
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,670
But I had to tell you.

223
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:42,378
I've got to sell the center.

224
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,628
There's nothing more I can do.

225
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:46,753
It's over.

226
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,545
You've no money left at all?

227
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:51,336
Nothing. Not a penny.

228
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:54,878
Don't be angry. I've tried everything.

229
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:15,878
What will happen to me?

230
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,753
I'm too old.

231
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,336
No one will take me on.

232
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,461
He could have done whatever he wanted,
I didn't care.

233
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,128
I only cared about you.

234
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,045
I'd rather die, Dora.

235
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,836
I'd drop dead if it meant
not having to see you like this.

236
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,670
Get out of here! Leave her!

237
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:40,420
It's your fault, after all.

238
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:42,170
I'm telling you, get out!

239
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:45,128
I didn't believe
that you really liked the center so much.

240
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:48,253
That day, Dora. That day!

241
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:51,503
- Three saddles, bad condition.
- Three saddles, bad condition.

242
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:56,836
- Seven bits and bridles.
- Seven bits and bridles.

243
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:06,211
I blame myself for
letting you go through that.

244
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,545
I blame myself.

245
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,878
I can't watch that.
I'm going to my mother's.

246
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,545
I'm going to my mother's.

247
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:14,711
But your mother wasn't home.

248
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,628
My mother's.

249
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,961
They told me she was away for the day.

250
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:24,711
You must have known.
You'd seen her the day before.

251
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,128
You tell each other everything.

252
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:36,628
Where were you going, Dora?

253
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:38,336
What did you...

254
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,753
No need for a taxi. She lived nearby.

255
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:43,586
You weren't going there?

256
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:47,628
It's doesn't matter anymore,
I suppose. I don't know anymore.

257
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,628
I don't know anymore.

258
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:54,420
When your mother comes,
I'll ask her about it.

259
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:55,628
A taxi.

260
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,628
Why?

261
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:00,211
Oh, Dora.

262
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:04,295
My Dora, just a little patience now.

263
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,420
The operation will work, Dora.

264
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:16,920
My little girl, my poor little girl,
my pretty thing.

265
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,545
It's mother, Dora. Mother's here.

266
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:28,545
You can't die.

267
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:31,461
I need you to stay alive for your mother.

268
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:34,003
To help your poor mother.

269
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:39,795
We'll be happy together again. Don't die!

270
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,920
They can't let her die!

271
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:46,545
They've got to do something.

272
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,545
They might be able to operate soon.

273
00:21:49,628 --> 00:21:53,545
You! Go back to your horses!
Go on and see to your accounts!

274
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:56,711
- You're responsible. It's your fault!
- Quiet, you'll wake her.

275
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,045
You're going to give me orders now? Me?

276
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:00,628
Your place is not here.

277
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:04,128
It's you that took her there.
If she dies, it will be your fault.

278
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:06,211
You son of a bitch!

279
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:10,461
Penniless! We're bankrupt!
We're selling everything, everything!

280
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,795
And we don't really care
what happens to her.

281
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:14,961
We could live anywhere, do anything.

282
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:17,628
And she would come with us.
She would come with us.

283
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,628
And that's why she's going to die.
Because of you.

284
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,586
At her age.

285
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,836
Dying.

286
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,961
- Dying!
- Quiet, for God's sake, be quiet!

287
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,086
Bastard.

288
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,628
Bastard, Bastard! Imbecile!

289
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:34,670
- Just wait, if she dies, just you wait!
- She's not going to die, I'm sure of it.

290
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,045
No, I know she'll die! I'm her mother,
I know it in my heart. She's dying!

291
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:40,878
Dora.

292
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:43,378
My little Dora...

293
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:46,711
She's going to die!

294
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,795
She's going to die!

295
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,378
Mother.

296
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:58,170
It's not true. I did what I could.
I love her, too. I love her more than...

297
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:59,253
You love her!

298
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,670
What good is your love to her now?

299
00:23:01,753 --> 00:23:03,711
Mother.

300
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:04,920
Dora.

301
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:07,170
Dora, I'm here.

302
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:10,545
Yes, my dear, mother's here.
Your mother's here.

303
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:13,378
You're not going to die, Dora.

304
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:16,336
- Tell me that you're not going to die!
- You'll get better.

305
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,461
It's not serious. It'll be over soon.

306
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:20,628
Go back to sleep.

307
00:23:22,003 --> 00:23:23,420
We won't talk anymore.

308
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,253
Mother.

309
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,211
Yes, my dear?

310
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:32,586
Mother.

311
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,878
Tell him.

312
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:38,711
You want...

313
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,545
Tell him.

314
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,753
- Everything.
- Everything?

315
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,045
Good.

316
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,295
I...

317
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:54,128
I want to hear.

318
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:56,253
Tell me what?

319
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:58,295
Now she has nothing to lose,

320
00:23:58,378 --> 00:23:59,670
she wants you to know.

321
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:01,628
What do you mean?

322
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:04,836
You're going to hear it all,
exactly what you deserve.

323
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:07,795
You really thought she loved you?
You always believed it.

324
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:09,211
But no, it's not so!

325
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:11,836
Neither of us could stand you
from the beginning.

326
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,045
We were in rags, we had to pull through.

327
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:15,628
And so, we found you.

328
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:19,128
Oh, we had trouble hooking you in.
But we got you eventually.

329
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:21,670
We started to reel you in. And you.

330
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:25,628
You came right along blindly, like a fool.

331
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:29,420
You gave us a good laugh.
Really, you can only laugh!

332
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:21,878
I think he'll do.

333
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:25,295
I think so. But could he be any uglier?

334
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:26,878
Well, he's not a looker.

335
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:31,628
Well, he's there
until you find someone better.

336
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:38,586
Were you hoping he'd put money in there?

337
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,211
He's very thoughtful.

338
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:43,920
I'm not used to that.

339
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:48,045
You've got to take it.
You'll be a little "Madame".

340
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:49,378
He'll be a good boy.

341
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,628
It worked! You could change things for us.

342
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:58,253
You were quite amusing as a lover.

343
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:00,628
We thought you were a bit pathetic.

344
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:15,920
But when you showed us
the school, we were impressed.

345
00:26:16,003 --> 00:26:17,711
It was something solid.

346
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:21,503
Well, it shows wealth.

347
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,961
You must be happy.

348
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,545
Not quite yet, actually.

349
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:32,253
You will be soon.

350
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,295
You can really talk.
We're not going to miss that!

351
00:26:49,503 --> 00:26:52,003
Since she's so ambitious,
she took over right away.

352
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:53,920
Lots of nice people here.

353
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:55,836
We never know.

354
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,628
See? I was right. It's not a bad deal.

355
00:27:01,211 --> 00:27:03,503
We believed it.

356
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,753
But people can be wrong,
and we were wrong.

357
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,003
She hated me as much as that?

358
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,586
Hated you?
At that point, she had no reason to.

359
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,795
You had money.
And she had lived with less.

360
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,503
Poor dear.

361
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:17,920
Luckily she had me.

362
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,586
I helped her.
She always told me everything.

363
00:27:20,753 --> 00:27:22,795
Everything that happened between you.

364
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:24,461
Even the small details.

365
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:26,586
I was a friend to her.

366
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,878
I know all about your little household.

367
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:31,836
Everything she did,
everything, I tell you.

368
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,295
Everything you said to her, every word.

369
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:42,545
- You'll get this on you.
- Ah, don't worry.

370
00:27:45,503 --> 00:27:46,795
Do you love me?

371
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:47,961
Isn't it obvious?

372
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:49,128
Yes, very.

373
00:27:53,753 --> 00:27:56,336
I know very well that you love me,
but I'm scared.

374
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:58,836
I get scared all the time.

375
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,045
Scared of what?

376
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,253
It's too much for me, you see?

377
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,920
I've got everything I could want.

378
00:28:05,503 --> 00:28:06,795
But I'm not there yet.

379
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,545
You'll get there.

380
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,170
You'll get everything.

381
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:15,086
I love you so much.

382
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,836
That scares me too.

383
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:22,795
Ask me for whatever you want,
anything at all.

384
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,836
I want you to be happy.

385
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,211
I'm a good husband, no?
I want to spoil you.

386
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,211
I could never refuse you anything.

387
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:31,211
Even if it's expensive?

388
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:34,586
Even if it's expensive.
Don't hesitate, I'll arrange anything.

389
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,461
Oh, I won't hesitate.

390
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:50,920
Well, there is something.

391
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:52,003
Tell me.

392
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,586
It's a little awkward. It's not for me.

393
00:29:01,836 --> 00:29:02,961
It's for mother.

394
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:05,253
You know she's not...

395
00:29:07,003 --> 00:29:09,753
If you could, well...

396
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:13,336
Just a little money to help tide her over
at the end of each month.

397
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,503
- Would you be so kind?
- Of course, my dear.

398
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:18,961
Naturally.

399
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:20,961
- You're a kind man.
- Dora...

400
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,503
Dora, dear.

401
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,045
You'll suffocate me.

402
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,503
My Dora.

403
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,711
What would I become
if you ever stopped loving me?

404
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:51,295
Does that make you laugh?

405
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:54,336
To think that
we could stop loving each other?

406
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,836
- What if I leave you one day?
- You?

407
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,753
You wouldn't leave me.

408
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,795
I'm scared about that,
but I know deep down.

409
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:05,545
If I found someone better, maybe richer.

410
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,086
What nonsense!

411
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:10,961
We're too good together.

412
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:19,628
I've got another favor to ask.

413
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:23,503
I'd like us to settle here

414
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:25,628
and make a beautiful home.

415
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:27,461
Do you want to?

416
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:31,253
A beautiful house
in which we can love each other even more.

417
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:46,378
- See you tomorrow, sir.
- See you tomorrow.

418
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:54,670
Heels!

419
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:57,211
Michel!

420
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:01,420
Sit straight.
And your heels, lower your heels.

421
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:02,586
Huh?

422
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:07,670
Aren't there more of them?

423
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:10,003
Yes. These three started this morning.

424
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:13,461
- Already riding?
- Yes, but we'll need to start again.

425
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:15,920
- They're not getting it.
- See you later.

426
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,211
Heels! Lower your heels.

427
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,878
Go with your horse.

428
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:24,670
Straight in front of you,
in front of you, young man.

429
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:28,128
Keep your distance. Bernard!

430
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:42,378
Mr. Robert, please come.
I can't hold Nana.

431
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:45,836
I need to untie her.

432
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,336
I know she can be hard,
but you don't know how to handle her.

433
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,545
- Robert!
- Yes.

434
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:54,211
Here.

435
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,795
I'm heading out to my mother's.

436
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:06,711
What's wrong?

437
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:10,128
Nothing. Nothing.
Everything is fine. I love you.

438
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:13,420
- Don't make that face, then.
- I promise I'll never make it again.

439
00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:16,378
- Do you need anything?
- No. I took some money. Bye.

440
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:19,628
Bye. Eat with your mother if you like.
I'll sort myself out.

441
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,753
Give her a kiss from me.

442
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:39,211
I still smell of horse.

443
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:43,128
And then he stole her away,
married her, and now they're in Chicago.

444
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,586
- No!
- Shit, it's sticking.

445
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,628
It seems that she's got two cars.

446
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:49,836
Good for her.

447
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,170
Don't be like that. Your turn will come.

448
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,503
I took some money to the bank.

449
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:56,295
A lot of money?

450
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:58,961
What I could get hold of.
Not bad for one month.

451
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:02,045
You're so organized. You're a smart girl.

452
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:04,920
You've got to be prepared.

453
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,295
You never know what might happen!

454
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:13,086
It's nice to be back here.

455
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,878
I can't afford the rent.

456
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:18,253
There's plenty of money in my bag.
Take some.

457
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,086
Yes, there was money.
Plenty of money. More than enough for us.

458
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,878
So why would we hate you?
You were a Godsend for women.

459
00:33:27,253 --> 00:33:29,753
Helper to the poor.

460
00:33:29,836 --> 00:33:32,420
I'm going to knock that down
to make more room.

461
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:36,003
I have to do up the bedroom first.
I'm doing the bathroom from scratch.

462
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:37,670
A new toilet isn't possible.

463
00:33:38,378 --> 00:33:40,378
Then I'll get to the living room...

464
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:42,211
When is your next loan payment?

465
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,253
In two weeks.

466
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:47,961
- How long until it's paid off?
- Eighteen months. Once every three months.

467
00:33:48,045 --> 00:33:50,170
Maybe you should wait a little.

468
00:33:50,253 --> 00:33:52,003
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

469
00:33:54,253 --> 00:33:56,420
You've got the stables to think about.

470
00:33:57,003 --> 00:33:58,753
Not to mention your employees.

471
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,795
Things aren't all in order.

472
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:03,795
Two of them aren't declared yet.

473
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:05,711
Let's talk about something else.

474
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:19,378
Monique!
When did you get back from Cannes?

475
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,795
Yesterday. It was marvelous.

476
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:25,795
- We spent the whole time out on the boat.
- Your tan is unbelievable!

477
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:27,461
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

478
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,503
What bad manners! Who's she?

479
00:34:29,586 --> 00:34:31,836
No one. The owner's wife, I think.

480
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,753
Look at her ugly clothes.

481
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:46,753
Jean, where are you going?

482
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,503
- To the woods.
- The woods? Wait for us.

483
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,503
Hello.

484
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:57,961
- Hello!
- So.

485
00:34:59,045 --> 00:35:01,045
I want to learn to ride.

486
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:08,295
And the little jobs. It all started
in order to improve your house.

487
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:10,795
It was all set up.

488
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:13,045
Comfort is everything for a woman.

489
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:15,420
Comfort and entertainment.

490
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,461
The horse rides with company

491
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:51,170
give one new ideas.

492
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:54,628
It was me who told her not to walk
in the woods when she was little.

493
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:56,336
Because of the wolves.

494
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:14,253
You see, I'd do the whole thing in pink.

495
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:17,920
- I thought about it, but I'd rather not.
- You can take a bath tomorrow.

496
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:19,545
It's about time.

497
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,878
I like his type.

498
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:31,211
Are you joking?

499
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:32,961
Maybe it's not worth the trouble.

500
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:36,003
It's annoying. Only old men have got cash.

501
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:38,420
That, my dear, is
the problem for all women.

502
00:36:40,211 --> 00:36:42,086
What on earth is going on?

503
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,670
Why are these curtains here?
I asked for them to be taken down.

504
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,503
Don't get worked up,
it's not a difficult job.

505
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:50,295
Here.

506
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,503
I'm beginning to get fed up
with Robert and his riding school.

507
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,086
Isn't it time to end all this?

508
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,003
We'll see, such a good little husband

509
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:03,295
who fixes you up a lovely apartment
for you to grow old in.

510
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:07,920
A husband who pays the rent for
his mother-in-law who he loves so much!

511
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,170
Good little husband.

512
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:17,045
This will be nice.
Don't you think, mother?

513
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:19,128
Dora takes after me. She has taste.

514
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,545
When it's finished,
we'll have a house-warming.

515
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,961
A nice meal and champagne, yes?

516
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:27,378
If you like. I'll get the horses ready.
Are you going to the woods?

517
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:30,586
No, it's too cold.
And I don't really enjoy it now.

518
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,170
Now, leave us to work!

519
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:36,378
Come on, my dear, go on. Be nice.
Away and leave us to work.

520
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:45,336
You're not going to the woods anymore?
What about the old man?

521
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:49,086
He went to prison yesterday.

522
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,628
Good God!

523
00:37:50,711 --> 00:37:54,711
Took them three years to work out
he'd been conspiring with the Germans.

524
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:57,378
Ah! We'll never forget these old stories.

525
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:01,003
It's bad luck but still, there's Robert.
We'll live.

526
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,753
Are you still putting money away at least?

527
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,003
I'm no fool.

528
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:08,003
I'll show you the dining room.
They started work yesterday.

529
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:13,920
See, I want a nice man like that
for a change.

530
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,045
So, she's dying?

531
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:20,795
As good as dead already.

532
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:23,795
Now that winter's here,
if you don't make the repairs,

533
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,961
all the rest will be too.

534
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:29,045
But we can't. We're building a bathroom.

535
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:31,670
That's how it all started.
Not making the repairs.

536
00:38:31,753 --> 00:38:34,128
It was because of her
that I didn't do the work.

537
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,295
And then, one day, we met François.

538
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,920
- François?
- He was pretty good.

539
00:38:38,003 --> 00:38:40,295
I didn't like him,
but had to acknowledge him.

540
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:41,405
François!

541
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,211
But you, you poor fool,
you didn't see anything.

542
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:45,795
François.

543
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:49,753
We had everything set up.
Civilian clothes. We were set.

544
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,920
We'd even managed to hide the signs.

545
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:55,420
- Three hours to go.
- Four, three, two.

546
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:58,961
And it was winter. It was cold.
My fingers couldn't hold any longer.

547
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,045
I thought I'd let go the whole time.

548
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,295
They'd have had us at the second station.

549
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:05,586
We thought they'd be waiting for us.

550
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,503
When they took us, they insulted us.

551
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:12,211
The first camp was hard,
but it was nothing compared to that one.

552
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,670
Thankfully, I had Raymond.
We supported each other.

553
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:22,003
He received some packages.
Did I tell you he died?

554
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:24,378
Oh, he died? How?

555
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:28,045
When we were trying to escape
the second time.

556
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:29,628
They had guns.

557
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:33,503
We stopped when we saw
we didn't stand a chance. Better that way.

558
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:35,586
He thought it'd be worth it.

559
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,045
He started running across the field.

560
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:39,336
They went after him.

561
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:41,545
It's a terrible thing, losing a friend.

562
00:39:42,128 --> 00:39:43,878
He was the only friend I had there.

563
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,795
- Don't think about that. It's over now.
- I can't help it.

564
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,461
Forget about it. Cheer up.

565
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:51,378
Waiter, one more!

566
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,878
Now, I have Dora.

567
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,336
You see?

568
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,170
He doesn't know his luck.

569
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:57,628
Don't forget the olives!

570
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,878
- You need to come. It's happening again.
- What's happening?

571
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:05,628
Jupiter is sick.

572
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,586
A sudden cold, like the other one.
I'm worried he's dying.

573
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,128
Don't be angry. See you soon.

574
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:12,045
- Just the two of us, then.
- Good idea!

575
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:15,128
- Don't be worried if I come home late.
- Very well. Bye!

576
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:24,503
You nearly blundered that.

577
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:28,878
Here!

578
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:33,586
Pay the bill. Then go.

579
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,295
- Here, did you see the watch?
- Yes.

580
00:40:36,878 --> 00:40:39,086
- Go on.
- Yes, I'm going.

581
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:44,003
Bye.

582
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:54,920
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

583
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,670
And your horse died

584
00:41:21,753 --> 00:41:24,711
while she was
sampling the menu in a fine restaurant.

585
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:26,086
Poor dear.

586
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,128
She profited well from it.

587
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,711
He had hair.

588
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:30,920
He was her age.

589
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:40,420
I can tell that you're unhappy.

590
00:41:42,253 --> 00:41:44,086
Even when you laugh,

591
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,461
there's something about you
which doesn't seem right.

592
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:49,253
A sort of nostalgia.

593
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:54,170
One could imagine you've suffered.

594
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:57,253
Is that maybe not ripe?

595
00:41:57,336 --> 00:41:58,628
- Yes, but...
- Wait.

596
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:00,461
No. I'll try to eat it, thanks.

597
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,420
- Really?
- Yes.

598
00:42:20,753 --> 00:42:22,670
Something in your personal life.

599
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:26,461
No sense of joy, perhaps.

600
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,878
I saw that earlier at the bar.

601
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:32,753
Tell me what it is.

602
00:42:34,211 --> 00:42:35,211
Don't you want to?

603
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:42,003
It's because of my husband.

604
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:44,128
I got married too young.

605
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,336
He's older than me and...

606
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:50,170
he doesn't understand me.

607
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:52,920
Oh, it's not that he's nasty.
I couldn't say that.

608
00:42:53,878 --> 00:42:56,503
Only, he doesn't see what I need.

609
00:42:57,628 --> 00:43:00,045
He's a man with no ambition. You see?

610
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:03,253
Me, I want to travel,
have a change of scene.

611
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,878
Ah, that's very hard, of course.

612
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,086
The bill, please.

613
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,670
He's not the man I need.

614
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,503
In many ways.

615
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:14,836
I felt sorry for him.
He had been a prisoner before.

616
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,378
So you see, I felt for him.

617
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:20,170
Ah! I regret it so often.

618
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:22,545
You mustn't regret.

619
00:43:23,545 --> 00:43:25,045
You did what you had to do.

620
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:26,461
My life has passed me by.

621
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:28,003
Don't say that.

622
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:29,836
I'm sure you love him.

623
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,378
Yes.

624
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,378
It's more affection, really.

625
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,795
That's enough.

626
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,295
- He gives me a lot of freedom, you know.
- I'm sure of it.

627
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,128
Shall we go?

628
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,586
Yes, if you like.

629
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:54,545
Let's go.

630
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,045
What shall we do?

631
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,503
Make use of the freedom that he gives you.

632
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:17,253
I live in Neuilly, not far from you.

633
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:21,378
Good! Some would call you forward!

634
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,961
I hope I haven't shocked you.

635
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,628
This way.

636
00:45:46,753 --> 00:45:48,045
Excuse me.

637
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,461
Here we are.

638
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,461
Make yourself at home.

639
00:46:11,003 --> 00:46:12,586
Goodness!

640
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,128
My apologies for having to bring you here.

641
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,253
I've come on hard times.

642
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:20,961
I hope that you're not too disappointed.

643
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:31,295
I've been a fool.

644
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:34,170
If you want to leave, I'll be sorry, but...

645
00:46:59,378 --> 00:47:02,795
- You don't want anything else?
- No, thank you, my dear. This is good.

646
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:12,738
Hello.

647
00:47:12,753 --> 00:47:16,461
Nothing to say? No news from you.
Nothing for three days.

648
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,961
How I would have looked if I had phoned?

649
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,420
And he thought that you were with me,
of course?

650
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:25,420
Correct.
I even slept at your house last night.

651
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:27,836
No! Be careful, though.

652
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:30,920
Him from the other night?

653
00:47:31,003 --> 00:47:32,128
The handsome one?

654
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:34,295
Yes, him.

655
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:37,461
- He's flat broke.
- You're joking?

656
00:47:37,545 --> 00:47:38,628
It's true.

657
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:41,920
Ah, he had money, once,
but I've come along a bit late.

658
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:43,586
Are you going mad?

659
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,795
- Are you...
- Oh, it's fine!

660
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:48,253
Aren't I allowed to have a little fun?

661
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:50,753
Drink your coffee, that'll keep you quiet.

662
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:52,545
What a bastard!

663
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:56,086
It's not right, that!

664
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:01,753
Are you in love?

665
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:06,920
- What would that look like?
- Being in love? Well.

666
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,670
When you're with a man
and you don't think about money.

667
00:48:12,295 --> 00:48:14,295
Well, with him, I do think about it.

668
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:16,628
It even makes me angry that he has none.

669
00:48:16,711 --> 00:48:18,211
Well, no danger, then.

670
00:48:20,836 --> 00:48:24,295
- I'd like to know that feeling once.
- Don't talk about misfortune!

671
00:48:24,378 --> 00:48:26,420
It's the right way to wind up done for.

672
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,711
Loving.

673
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:30,545
It started to work on her all at once.

674
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:35,295
It's a shame we don't love each other.

675
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,878
That would change things for us.

676
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:44,295
I wonder what there is
that we need to change.

677
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:47,295
There's that, and there's money.

678
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,045
Do you want more money too?

679
00:48:51,086 --> 00:48:52,086
Yes,

680
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:54,253
and a lot of it.

681
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:56,211
That's everything.

682
00:48:57,545 --> 00:48:59,461
If we had money,

683
00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:02,753
there would be no reason
for us not to love each other.

684
00:49:04,545 --> 00:49:06,378
I think there would be, even so.

685
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:08,920
At least, for me.

686
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,920
- Isn't this good?
- Yes.

687
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:15,420
Very good.

688
00:49:16,295 --> 00:49:18,878
- But it's not just that.
- What else is there?

689
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:21,961
I'll tell you one day.

690
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:24,961
You should go to sleep.

691
00:49:34,545 --> 00:49:36,045
I could love you.

692
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:38,795
I'm bored to tears.

693
00:49:38,878 --> 00:49:40,211
If I forced myself.

694
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,920
Certainly don't force it.
It's much better if you don't.

695
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:49,461
Go home. It's late.

696
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,670
Oh, I've got time.

697
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:54,420
I'm out at the cinema with mother.

698
00:49:57,586 --> 00:50:00,253
- Do you play golf?
- I have played, yes.

699
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:03,711
When you stay in nice hotels.

700
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,295
Precisely.

701
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:10,295
- Do you ride?
- Yes.

702
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:15,670
I also swim, I ski, I play tennis,
I drive and I dance. Is that enough?

703
00:50:15,753 --> 00:50:17,128
All the fashionable sports.

704
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,336
Exactly.

705
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:25,711
Seriously now, you have to leave.

706
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:32,378
But we never go out together. I'm fed up.

707
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:35,586
It can't go on like this.

708
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,420
I'm getting out of here, you'll see,
I'm getting out.

709
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:41,086
You always say that.
So, what are you waiting for?

710
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,836
Where would I go?

711
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,378
Well. Find that out.

712
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:52,295
Thank you.

713
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:01,920
Are you going to decide to do something
some day?

714
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:04,920
So I can support you?

715
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:11,961
If I don't do something,
it'll get serious.

716
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:15,795
You've got no money?

717
00:51:18,003 --> 00:51:20,586
Enough for two or three days.

718
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,086
Great.

719
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,128
Do you want to lend me some?

720
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,086
This isn't that type of house, you know.

721
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:34,961
It's quite like mine.

722
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:38,295
But not in that way.

723
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:40,711
No, yours must be bigger.

724
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:43,836
Much bigger.

725
00:51:47,378 --> 00:51:50,170
Oh, get dressed. It's time.

726
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:00,045
We get no luck, do we?

727
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,378
We don't ask so much of life.

728
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:08,253
Lots of money,

729
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,795
and a little love.

730
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,003
Some people have that.

731
00:52:22,795 --> 00:52:25,003
Are you sure we couldn't love each other?

732
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,253
Completely sure.

733
00:52:36,878 --> 00:52:38,461
I'm falling asleep.

734
00:52:44,336 --> 00:52:45,670
Kiss me.

735
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,670
I want you to kiss me. Come on.

736
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:59,211
You're not going to become
a nuisance, are you?

737
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:03,753
Come on. Since we've nothing else,
we can at least have that.

738
00:53:09,378 --> 00:53:12,211
It became an obsession.
I didn't know what else to do.

739
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:14,503
Did...

740
00:53:14,586 --> 00:53:15,836
Did she love him?

741
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,003
Did she have a mind to love someone?

742
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,461
François.

743
00:53:25,628 --> 00:53:29,920
I saw nothing, nothing.
And the toil continued.

744
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,378
She's nervous today.
I won't take her tomorrow.

745
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:42,128
She's always that way.

746
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:44,711
Come on!

747
00:53:57,753 --> 00:54:00,003
That will get you noticed.
Bring people in.

748
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:02,211
I don't really like this type
of publicity.

749
00:54:02,795 --> 00:54:06,003
Look somewhere else. There are
four riding schools in this area.

750
00:54:06,086 --> 00:54:08,503
- I'll give you their addresses.
- I've been there.

751
00:54:08,586 --> 00:54:10,961
Well, I'm not the only one.

752
00:54:11,045 --> 00:54:12,545
But what am I going to do?

753
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,295
My poor students, it's for them.

754
00:54:14,378 --> 00:54:16,503
We'll do a very artistic show.

755
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,420
We'll be doing it in the best clubs
in Tanger in a month.

756
00:54:19,503 --> 00:54:20,503
Excuse me.

757
00:54:31,086 --> 00:54:32,170
What happened?

758
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:34,920
Nana did it. It's just happened.
She doesn't like him.

759
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:37,878
Is he insured?

760
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:39,461
He's not even on the books.

761
00:54:40,503 --> 00:54:42,920
- We're going to pay for this.
- Is it serious?

762
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:45,128
I think so.

763
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:46,753
Call the hospital.

764
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:51,128
Is he ill?

765
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:52,420
I'd say so.

766
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:54,586
That happens to workers all the time.

767
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:02,836
There's a fine to pay, too.

768
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:17,336
If you'd like to come back to my office,
we'll discuss prices.

769
00:55:29,586 --> 00:55:31,253
Pelvic fracture,

770
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:32,920
injuries,

771
00:55:33,003 --> 00:55:34,461
I don't know what else.

772
00:55:34,545 --> 00:55:35,961
Some Camel, please.

773
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:38,170
Undeclared, uninsured, not anything.

774
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,253
A wife and three kids.
That's a bad blow for us.

775
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:43,503
Thank you.

776
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,628
Hold on.

777
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:52,461
Since you'll have to replace him,

778
00:55:53,211 --> 00:55:55,878
mother knows someone, a very good rider.

779
00:55:56,545 --> 00:55:57,878
Really very good.

780
00:55:57,961 --> 00:56:00,170
Tell her to send him to me
tomorrow morning.

781
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:01,878
I'd say you'll like him.

782
00:56:02,878 --> 00:56:05,003
It's kind of you to take care of that.

783
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,086
Well, old married couples need
to do each other favors.

784
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,628
Money running out.

785
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:17,253
Holding on to it.

786
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,295
It was awful to watch it slip away.

787
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:21,170
- There.
- Thank you, sir.

788
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:23,711
- So, next time?
- Yes.

789
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:26,836
- I might need a little less.
- As you wish. Just let me know.

790
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,420
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Goodbye.

791
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:37,961
Why will you need less oats?

792
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:40,836
I just said it without thinking.

793
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:43,836
You never know.

794
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:52,545
What are you thinking of doing?

795
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,378
Well?

796
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,628
I'm going to sell a horse.

797
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,336
To the ones on Longchamp Street?

798
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,128
Yes.

799
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,545
There's nothing else I can do, my friend.

800
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:08,711
Don't worry about it.

801
00:57:09,503 --> 00:57:11,586
We'll buy another one when things pick up.

802
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,378
We might as well do it right away.

803
00:57:22,503 --> 00:57:24,295
You think it doesn't hurt me too?

804
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,836
Selling the horses.

805
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:33,795
Louis, selling the horses.

806
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,878
- Let me know if you want to sell the rest.
- Not for the moment, no.

807
00:57:47,628 --> 00:57:49,711
They'll take care of them well there.

808
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:08,045
One less horse isn't worth all this drama.

809
00:58:09,545 --> 00:58:12,128
It's not the first time
I've seen one sold.

810
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:13,420
Me neither.

811
00:58:13,503 --> 00:58:15,795
But it's a bad sign when it comes.

812
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:20,086
How far behind are the payments?

813
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,461
A month.

814
00:58:21,545 --> 00:58:23,628
I can't even pay it with this.

815
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:26,628
It will help with small expenses.

816
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,253
And a few of your other jobs.

817
00:58:29,336 --> 00:58:32,295
So, clients are leaving me because
I'm redecorating my flat?

818
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,503
- Is that why they're doing winter sports?
- They're not doing winter sports.

819
00:58:40,086 --> 00:58:42,670
They're riding at the center
on Longchamp Street.

820
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,503
It's cleaner.

821
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:47,628
The horses aren't freezing to death.
They're better fed.

822
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,461
They've transformed that school.
It's very good now.

823
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,878
- They've got grandstands.
- So what?

824
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:57,586
Is it my fault I don't have the money
to do as much as them?

825
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:01,336
Perhaps it has something to do
with the apartment.

826
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:04,336
And some other expenses.

827
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,170
Mind your own business.

828
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:25,670
Émile!

829
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:28,378
This is ridiculous.

830
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:31,086
Émile!

831
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:37,211
He had an accident, madam.
I'm his replacement.

832
00:59:37,295 --> 00:59:39,170
So.

833
00:59:39,253 --> 00:59:41,253
We've got a good bargain.

834
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:43,378
- Are you the stable boy?
- Yes, madam.

835
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:46,378
Well!
I had requested that I ride Sugar today.

836
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,420
- Is someone riding him now?
- I'm sorry, we just let him out.

837
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,045
If I had known...

838
00:59:51,128 --> 00:59:53,003
Émile could have left a note.

839
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:56,503
This place is a shambles.
If this keeps up, you'll have no one left.

840
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:57,670
Well.

841
00:59:57,753 --> 00:59:58,920
Give me...

842
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:00,961
Give me Azur.

843
01:00:01,045 --> 01:00:02,295
Right away, madam.

844
01:00:09,836 --> 01:00:11,878
- Good day.
- Good day, madam.

845
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:13,545
I've never seen you riding.

846
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,211
Don't you know how?

847
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:17,878
I do, but I despise horses
and everything about them.

848
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:21,045
How amusing
for the wife of a riding instructor.

849
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:22,461
Isn't it?

850
01:00:22,545 --> 01:00:25,545
- Will I take him into the barn?
- No, I'm going to the woods.

851
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:43,961
Thank you.

852
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:47,753
You're far too distinguished.
I'd never dare to give you a tip.

853
01:00:51,211 --> 01:00:52,545
Strange job!

854
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:54,211
This one or another.

855
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:04,086
What's so funny?

856
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:07,878
It is funny!

857
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:16,253
You working here.
And him, sorting his accounts.

858
01:01:16,336 --> 01:01:19,461
You're really something, aren't you?
So self-centered.

859
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:21,836
Oh! You're not bad yourself.

860
01:01:22,878 --> 01:01:23,878
Yeah.

861
01:01:27,086 --> 01:01:29,920
You'd better not hang around here.
If he ever noticed...

862
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:31,545
Him? You don't know him.

863
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:36,461
Admit that it bothers you.

864
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:41,336
It's a strange situation, isn't it?

865
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,045
He's nice, too.

866
01:01:43,128 --> 01:01:44,836
Oh, he's the best.

867
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:47,378
You're not warming up to him, are you?

868
01:01:48,461 --> 01:01:49,795
That'd be something.

869
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,961
- Kiss me.
- Go now, come on. That's enough.

870
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:01,920
Kiss me.

871
01:02:02,003 --> 01:02:03,836
Not here. It's foolish.

872
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,711
But that's the fun.

873
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:09,586
You're a real bitch!

874
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:16,378
If madam will let you go for a minute,

875
01:02:16,545 --> 01:02:18,295
the horses are hungry.

876
01:02:19,628 --> 01:02:21,253
Brute!

877
01:02:22,461 --> 01:02:25,003
And I'd finally found a respectable job.

878
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,795
You won't be fired, you'll see.

879
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:47,670
Do you want something?

880
01:03:02,003 --> 01:03:03,711
You could have excused yourself.

881
01:03:08,003 --> 01:03:09,003
Well?

882
01:03:09,836 --> 01:03:11,086
Well, what?

883
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,420
Are you going to tell him?

884
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:14,920
If I want to!

885
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,503
And what good will that do you?

886
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,170
It'll ease my conscience.

887
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,295
Don't you think
he's had enough trouble already?

888
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:29,336
You want to give him more?

889
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:33,753
You can talk. It won't change anything.

890
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:36,295
I'd defend myself.

891
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:39,003
And it's you we'll get rid of.

892
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,795
What's more, you'd destroy him.

893
01:03:42,878 --> 01:03:44,961
Not very nice for a friend. Is it?

894
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:48,503
It'd even be quite cruel.

895
01:03:50,045 --> 01:03:52,670
That and all the debt,
it's a lot for one man to take.

896
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:54,545
Don't you think?

897
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:04,086
I'll give you the money tomorrow.

898
01:04:06,045 --> 01:04:07,336
Whore!

899
01:04:08,295 --> 01:04:09,753
What's going on?

900
01:04:09,836 --> 01:04:11,711
If I'm here too much, I can go.

901
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:14,128
I won't be spoken to that way.

902
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:15,628
What did you say to her?

903
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:17,586
I don't know.

904
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:20,878
Nothing.

905
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:24,253
She took it the wrong way.

906
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:29,878
Watch yourself, good God.
You know that she's on edge.

907
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:38,878
If he's not said anything by now,
he won't.

908
01:04:38,961 --> 01:04:42,461
But be careful. You'll make me ill
with all this carelessness.

909
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,503
You're like a baby.
It will only bring you trouble.

910
01:04:47,795 --> 01:04:50,670
- Maybe, but there are some compensations.
- Like what?

911
01:04:51,586 --> 01:04:54,128
You won't be the first woman
to think of it.

912
01:04:54,211 --> 01:04:56,170
Oh! I didn't show you.

913
01:04:56,253 --> 01:04:58,211
I bought a new cushion.

914
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,753
Look, isn't it sweet?

915
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:04,211
You'd be better
to put some money aside, you know.

916
01:05:04,295 --> 01:05:06,003
Things still aren't going well?

917
01:05:06,086 --> 01:05:08,336
The center's done. It won't last long.

918
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,961
Are you serious?

919
01:05:10,045 --> 01:05:12,461
I'm almost glad about it.

920
01:05:12,545 --> 01:05:15,211
No more horses, no more dung,
no more Louis, finished.

921
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,711
I didn't like it anyway,
but if it's run aground...

922
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:21,045
But what will happen to us?
We won't just start again like before.

923
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:25,461
Listen, darling, I might have someone.

924
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:27,920
At any rate, I have to introduce you both.

925
01:05:28,003 --> 01:05:30,920
If things fall apart,
we'll land straight back on our feet.

926
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:32,003
Don't you think?

927
01:05:33,711 --> 01:05:36,753
Even if it's not certain,
that could fix things.

928
01:05:36,836 --> 01:05:39,711
- I could be a streetworker too.
- Why are you saying that?

929
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:40,961
Oh! No reason.

930
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:43,086
Go on then. Bring in the goods.

931
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,211
He's a serious man.

932
01:05:45,295 --> 01:05:47,045
Not a doormat, like the others.

933
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:49,086
Here.

934
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:53,795
You won't have to worry about anything
with him. He's reliable.

935
01:05:53,878 --> 01:05:56,878
- What does he do?
- He works in food production.

936
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:58,670
He's a wholesaler.

937
01:05:58,753 --> 01:06:00,086
Ah, that'd work.

938
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:02,086
And...

939
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:06,378
If he takes to you,
maybe he'll marry you. You never know.

940
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:08,378
It's easy to get a divorce.

941
01:06:09,378 --> 01:06:11,003
- How old?
- He's not very young.

942
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:13,170
But he's not too old.

943
01:06:13,253 --> 01:06:15,670
At least, in any case, he's healthy.

944
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,211
And he likes to laugh,
not like the other one.

945
01:06:19,295 --> 01:06:22,586
He wants a little wife to spoil.

946
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:23,670
And you get a cut?

947
01:06:23,753 --> 01:06:27,795
Oh! To say that to your mother,
who only thinks of your happiness.

948
01:06:27,878 --> 01:06:29,670
Who wants to see you happy.

949
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:34,503
- You're going?
- Yes. See you tomorrow.

950
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:38,211
Oh! Don't cry.

951
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:40,003
I'm not feeling right today.

952
01:06:40,086 --> 01:06:41,503
You've changed.

953
01:06:41,586 --> 01:06:43,420
I can see that you're worried.

954
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:44,878
No.

955
01:06:44,961 --> 01:06:47,045
You don't want to meet him?

956
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,836
No strings attached.

957
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
You'll like him.

958
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,420
Not now, I don't want to.

959
01:06:53,128 --> 01:06:56,170
Dora, it's not like you
to refuse like that.

960
01:06:56,253 --> 01:07:00,253
François,
you're sure that you don't love him?

961
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:02,086
Tell me.

962
01:07:02,628 --> 01:07:04,086
I already told you, no.

963
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,586
Well then, don't throw away
good opportunities.

964
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:08,128
Think of your future.

965
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:10,170
- Think it over.
- For goodness sake!

966
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,961
You won't starve. Stop worrying.

967
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:15,211
Leave me alone, you hear? Leave me alone.

968
01:07:22,711 --> 01:07:24,336
Pay attention!

969
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:26,003
Now!

970
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,378
One, two.

971
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,920
One, two, three, drop.

972
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:33,378
One, two, three, arms.

973
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:35,878
One, two, three, keep going.

974
01:07:35,961 --> 01:07:37,336
Keep turning.

975
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,045
Ingrid into the middle, careful, listen!

976
01:07:40,128 --> 01:07:42,086
Lead your horse.

977
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:45,336
There, into the middle,
everyone else, keep turning.

978
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:48,336
One, two, keep going.

979
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,920
Attention, stop moving.

980
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:53,503
Get ready, listen to the song, sing out.

981
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:55,128
One, two.

982
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,753
It's love

983
01:07:57,836 --> 01:08:00,753
that floats in the air all around

984
01:08:00,836 --> 01:08:02,003
Right hand up.

985
01:08:02,086 --> 01:08:03,420
It's love...

986
01:08:03,503 --> 01:08:04,586
Stretch out.

987
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:07,670
that consoles the whole poor world

988
01:08:07,753 --> 01:08:08,696
Back around.

989
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,295
It's love...

990
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,378
Very good.

991
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:13,836
that makes each day a joy.

992
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,545
Move and smile.

993
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:16,920
It's love...

994
01:08:17,003 --> 01:08:18,211
Keep going.

995
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:20,170
that sets us all free

996
01:08:20,253 --> 01:08:21,253
Descending.

997
01:08:23,128 --> 01:08:24,753
One, two.

998
01:08:24,836 --> 01:08:27,211
It's love

999
01:08:27,295 --> 01:08:30,336
that floats in the air all around

1000
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,363
Look happy.

1001
01:08:31,378 --> 01:08:33,045
It's love...

1002
01:08:33,211 --> 01:08:34,155
Arms stretched.

1003
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:36,003
that consoles the whole poor world

1004
01:08:36,086 --> 01:08:37,628
Two, three.

1005
01:08:37,711 --> 01:08:39,253
It's love...

1006
01:08:39,336 --> 01:08:40,378
Let's go!

1007
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:42,378
that makes each day a joy

1008
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:44,170
The steps, now.

1009
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,711
It's love

1010
01:08:45,795 --> 01:08:47,420
Sing, ladies.

1011
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:51,128
that sets us all free

1012
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:52,961
You're late.

1013
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,711
On the stage at "sets us all free".

1014
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:57,170
Pay attention now,

1015
01:08:57,253 --> 01:09:00,961
sing and move, and sing out, above all.

1016
01:09:01,128 --> 01:09:02,420
One, two.

1017
01:09:02,503 --> 01:09:05,128
It's love

1018
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:09,295
that floats in the air all around

1019
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,753
It's love

1020
01:09:11,836 --> 01:09:15,878
that consoles the whole poor world

1021
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:18,420
It's love

1022
01:09:18,503 --> 01:09:21,503
that makes each day a joy

1023
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:22,530
Arms!

1024
01:09:22,545 --> 01:09:24,711
It's love

1025
01:09:24,878 --> 01:09:30,336
that sets us all free

1026
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:34,961
You're coming down too early.
Only at "sets us all free".

1027
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:38,170
If it's too early or too late,
it's out of sync.

1028
01:09:38,253 --> 01:09:42,128
And smile, ladies.
And sing. I can't hear you.

1029
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,211
Come, children. Let's go.

1030
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:46,211
Right, from the top.

1031
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:49,128
Ready, one, two.

1032
01:09:49,295 --> 01:09:52,045
It's love

1033
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:54,711
that floats in the air all around

1034
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:56,461
Attention to your arms.

1035
01:09:56,545 --> 01:09:58,711
It's love

1036
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:01,878
that consoles the whole poor world

1037
01:10:01,961 --> 01:10:03,461
One, two, three.

1038
01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:07,295
Up already?

1039
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,461
I can't sleep with all this going on.

1040
01:10:09,545 --> 01:10:11,086
How long before they're gone?

1041
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:14,336
Another two weeks.

1042
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,336
One, two, three. Arms.

1043
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:18,920
One, two.

1044
01:10:19,003 --> 01:10:22,378
You're right. It's putting clients off.
But I can't throw them out.

1045
01:10:23,628 --> 01:10:27,503
Ah, I need some money.
Are you remembering mother?

1046
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:30,961
It's already the seventh.
You didn't send her anything last month.

1047
01:10:31,045 --> 01:10:32,836
I was going to do it today.

1048
01:10:33,586 --> 01:10:35,461
One, two, three.

1049
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:39,503
Speaking of mother,
is her protégé going to the woods now?

1050
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,961
It was that woman who asked me for him.

1051
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,003
I think that...

1052
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,961
What are you running?
A riding school or a brothel?

1053
01:10:47,128 --> 01:10:49,295
I can't disappoint the clients.

1054
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,503
There aren't too many of them.

1055
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:55,086
What does it matter?

1056
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,753
You're so nervous.

1057
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,836
You should go relax.

1058
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,503
Relax? How could I with all this noise?

1059
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:04,586
I want to go for a ride.

1060
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,253
I need to get some air.

1061
01:11:07,336 --> 01:11:09,545
Very good! But be careful.

1062
01:11:09,628 --> 01:11:11,378
No one's more careful than me.

1063
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:13,420
You should ask François to go with you.

1064
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:15,211
You've not ridden in a long time.

1065
01:11:15,295 --> 01:11:17,586
I'll see. Might not be worth the trouble.

1066
01:11:18,628 --> 01:11:21,086
Indeed, it wasn't worth it.

1067
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,961
- You seem worried this evening.
- Yes, quite.

1068
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,003
I haven't seen you for eight days.

1069
01:11:28,086 --> 01:11:30,628
Already? How time flies!

1070
01:11:32,211 --> 01:11:34,961
- What have I done to you?
- You? Nothing. Why?

1071
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,628
Very well!
Have you got something to tell me?

1072
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:39,461
I stayed at your place three times.

1073
01:11:42,336 --> 01:11:44,170
François, don't you want me anymore?

1074
01:11:44,753 --> 01:11:47,336
No. It's just too complicated.

1075
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,128
But are you looking to settle down
like me?

1076
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:51,503
There's that, yes.

1077
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,170
That woman was right about you.

1078
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,295
You are distinguished.

1079
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:00,961
Still, we're really the same, you and I.

1080
01:12:01,795 --> 01:12:03,545
You think you're distinguished?

1081
01:12:09,836 --> 01:12:11,670
Come down for a bit. I'm tired.

1082
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:43,211
Haven't you found anyone yet?

1083
01:12:43,295 --> 01:12:46,295
It's getting urgent.
Business is pretty bad for you, I think.

1084
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:48,336
Someone in sight.

1085
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:49,753
Ah, that's reassuring.

1086
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:54,711
- You're not going to beat me to it.
- Is that so?

1087
01:12:57,378 --> 01:12:59,045
Is she wealthy?

1088
01:12:59,711 --> 01:13:01,045
Enough.

1089
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:06,836
Nice places, trips.
Megeve, Cannes, Egypt. She's elegant!

1090
01:13:07,836 --> 01:13:09,795
Not bad for her age, as you could see.

1091
01:13:12,461 --> 01:13:14,211
You've got strange luck!

1092
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:17,670
Your man's not up to scratch?

1093
01:13:19,295 --> 01:13:20,670
He's in wholesale foods.

1094
01:13:23,003 --> 01:13:25,461
How excellent!

1095
01:13:25,545 --> 01:13:27,295
Oh, shut up.

1096
01:13:27,378 --> 01:13:29,961
I've not seen him yet.
It was mother who found him.

1097
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:32,211
What a good thing to have a mother.

1098
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:35,170
So you're going to accept, I think?

1099
01:13:36,461 --> 01:13:37,836
You don't want to miss out.

1100
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,295
I'm going to try something else first.

1101
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:45,836
I want to go to Megeve too, and to Cannes.

1102
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:48,961
It would be a pleasure to give you that.

1103
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,503
I want to go there
with another type of person.

1104
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:55,961
Keep trying.

1105
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:01,128
You've got a few weeks
before it crashes down. Enjoy them.

1106
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,461
And us, it's...

1107
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:09,961
For now.

1108
01:14:16,878 --> 01:14:19,003
Let me know if you're free some evening.

1109
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:20,628
Will do.

1110
01:14:22,045 --> 01:14:25,670
If madam will allow, I have to go back.
I have a lesson at 4 o'clock.

1111
01:14:29,628 --> 01:14:31,045
I won't ask you to kiss me.

1112
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:32,878
Why not?

1113
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:34,878
It's always nice.

1114
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,086
It's incredible how sentimental you are.

1115
01:14:51,961 --> 01:14:53,878
Well, that's just how I am.

1116
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:56,378
He was a little bastard. Look what he did.

1117
01:14:56,461 --> 01:14:59,086
Treating my daughter that way.

1118
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:11,628
The stable emptied! It emptied!

1119
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:14,586
- And don't you want to sell this one?
- No. I'm keeping it.

1120
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,586
Oh, I'm exhausted.

1121
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:22,170
- Will you take me for some tea?
- Dressed like that?

1122
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,836
When did you become so formal?

1123
01:15:28,003 --> 01:15:29,878
And then you put on weight.

1124
01:15:29,961 --> 01:15:33,336
Around fifty, be careful!
You should get on.

1125
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,503
- It's awful, you know?
- Oh, I know!

1126
01:15:35,586 --> 01:15:37,878
- Oh, sorry!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1127
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:39,545
You haven't hurt me.

1128
01:15:39,628 --> 01:15:41,420
Éric, are you coming?

1129
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:45,420
Beautiful!

1130
01:15:45,503 --> 01:15:47,170
If you like common folk.

1131
01:15:47,253 --> 01:15:49,003
From time to time, yes. It's fun.

1132
01:15:50,461 --> 01:15:53,003
You're right.
I'm going to take up riding again.

1133
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:55,836
He didn't waste time.
The next day, he was there.

1134
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,295
We thought we'd struck gold with this one.

1135
01:15:58,378 --> 01:16:00,420
I was praying for it to work out.

1136
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:10,670
A real man of the world.

1137
01:16:10,753 --> 01:16:14,378
Wealthy and handsome, ideal!

1138
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:16,545
She could be happy with him.

1139
01:16:17,128 --> 01:16:20,378
And I showed her nice places to go,

1140
01:16:20,461 --> 01:16:22,420
the kind of places she was made for.

1141
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:26,628
But she's no fool. She followed my advice.

1142
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:28,670
Letting him take her hand.

1143
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:30,420
It's not an engagement.

1144
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,461
She didn't pull it back right away.

1145
01:16:42,045 --> 01:16:44,336
Such a distinguished gentleman.

1146
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:47,836
One time I saw him,
he took my breath away.

1147
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,086
The two of them made an excellent couple.

1148
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:54,003
Charming.

1149
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,128
Taking walks.

1150
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:01,628
Playing the good horseman.

1151
01:17:01,711 --> 01:17:05,420
And she looked the part, my girl.
She could have done it for a living.

1152
01:17:05,503 --> 01:17:08,628
He was kind and gallant. It worked well.

1153
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,545
And then the first kiss.

1154
01:17:18,378 --> 01:17:19,670
But suddenly others came.

1155
01:17:20,253 --> 01:17:22,170
They thought he was making fun of her.

1156
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:54,586
- Good ride?
- Yes, very good.

1157
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,086
Thank you again for
having accepted my company.

1158
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,920
- Will you need them again today?
- No.

1159
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,961
Wouldn't you enjoy that?
A family celebration.

1160
01:18:08,045 --> 01:18:10,045
Single men enjoy that.

1161
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:11,545
You always have good ideas.

1162
01:18:15,003 --> 01:18:17,961
It seems you like him.
It's always him you go with.

1163
01:18:18,045 --> 01:18:20,753
You're mad.
If you actually think I enjoy it.

1164
01:18:21,878 --> 01:18:24,586
I do it for you.
To keep us at least one client.

1165
01:18:26,545 --> 01:18:28,295
Forgive me.

1166
01:18:28,378 --> 01:18:29,920
I'm always afraid.

1167
01:18:41,253 --> 01:18:43,753
When she came back late,
I knew where she had been.

1168
01:18:43,836 --> 01:18:47,128
She had played the game and won.

1169
01:18:48,211 --> 01:18:49,545
Let me out here.

1170
01:18:58,545 --> 01:19:00,128
You don't regret it?

1171
01:19:00,961 --> 01:19:02,503
It was wonderful.

1172
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:08,878
Never leave me.

1173
01:19:09,795 --> 01:19:11,586
Take me with you when you go.

1174
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:14,628
Promise me.

1175
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:23,545
I need to go now. I'll be late.

1176
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,295
I love you.

1177
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:34,586
I think I love you.

1178
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:04,378
Two weeks, just two weeks left.

1179
01:20:06,753 --> 01:20:10,045
It didn't split.
Give it back when you leave him.

1180
01:20:10,128 --> 01:20:12,711
There's no reason. I'll give it to him.

1181
01:20:12,795 --> 01:20:14,795
- We've no gift to give him.
- Exactly.

1182
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,961
If you don't mind, I'll be leaving.

1183
01:20:18,045 --> 01:20:20,003
- Well, you've looked hard.
- Wait for me.

1184
01:20:20,086 --> 01:20:21,086
I'll do what I like.

1185
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:23,628
Oh, enough!
Take the argument into the office.

1186
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:26,128
- I'm taking mother home. She's tired.
- Yes.

1187
01:20:27,878 --> 01:20:31,128
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, no. Keep talking.

1188
01:20:31,211 --> 01:20:32,795
François is going our way.

1189
01:20:32,878 --> 01:20:34,961
- Good night, Robert.
- Good night, mother.

1190
01:20:35,753 --> 01:20:38,753
- How about lunch on Tuesday?
- You can make me something nice.

1191
01:20:38,836 --> 01:20:40,045
Will do.

1192
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,253
- Wasn't that nice?
- Yes.

1193
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:46,586
A nice celebration like that.
Makes you forget your troubles.

1194
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:47,613
You like it?

1195
01:20:47,628 --> 01:20:51,503
- It'll be difficult. It's a charming ring.
- That's never the price of a horse.

1196
01:20:51,586 --> 01:20:52,795
- Come back quickly.
- Yes.

1197
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:54,253
Goodbye!

1198
01:20:54,336 --> 01:20:57,003
Dora, give me your arm.
I've drunk too much.

1199
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:58,670
It's the champagne!

1200
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:01,003
Two bottles to myself!

1201
01:21:01,086 --> 01:21:02,253
Still the same price?

1202
01:21:02,336 --> 01:21:03,878
- What?
- Nothing.

1203
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:04,961
Bye.

1204
01:21:05,045 --> 01:21:05,988
Good night!

1205
01:21:06,003 --> 01:21:08,961
- Thank you for the invitation.
- It was our pleasure.

1206
01:21:15,586 --> 01:21:19,086
Oh! Tell me quickly.
I didn't dare to ask before.

1207
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,378
Yes. I'm cheating on my husband.

1208
01:21:24,128 --> 01:21:27,003
- Get home safely.
- Thank you, Robert!

1209
01:21:29,461 --> 01:21:32,711
My dear, we're out of the woods.
I've become a woman of the world.

1210
01:21:32,795 --> 01:21:33,780
For sure?

1211
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:36,295
It's in the bag.
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.

1212
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,753
You're old enough
to get home alone, I think.

1213
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:09,961
François, wait a moment.

1214
01:22:10,045 --> 01:22:11,878
Oh la la! I'm so relieved.

1215
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,795
- We deserve it!
- Oh! Yes!

1216
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:20,461
Oh, yes, you have permission
to stay at mine tonight.

1217
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:23,461
Go on, good night.
Don't get up to any mischief.

1218
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:25,545
I wouldn't mind.

1219
01:22:27,628 --> 01:22:30,170
Good night, Mr. Gigolo.

1220
01:22:33,461 --> 01:22:35,753
Your mother is very happy.

1221
01:22:35,836 --> 01:22:36,878
She's what?

1222
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:39,336
Sleep well, you two!

1223
01:22:59,378 --> 01:23:00,795
I'm going away.

1224
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:03,045
Far?

1225
01:23:03,753 --> 01:23:04,836
Ankara.

1226
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:08,711
That's a long journey.

1227
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,545
Soon?

1228
01:23:11,628 --> 01:23:13,086
In two weeks.

1229
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:17,170
I won. He's taking me.

1230
01:23:18,003 --> 01:23:19,461
It's all over.

1231
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:22,045
I've got the money.

1232
01:23:23,045 --> 01:23:25,461
Dora in the embassies! Do you realize?

1233
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:28,461
Yes.

1234
01:23:33,711 --> 01:23:35,836
Do you know how to peel an orange?

1235
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:38,003
Do what?

1236
01:23:38,086 --> 01:23:40,336
Peel an orange.

1237
01:23:41,378 --> 01:23:44,670
No.
You should learn, you'll get them there.

1238
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,670
That's all I have to say.

1239
01:23:47,295 --> 01:23:48,461
That's my advice.

1240
01:23:50,795 --> 01:23:53,336
I suppose you know how to peel an orange?

1241
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:55,670
But you're still here.

1242
01:23:55,753 --> 01:23:57,753
- You're not gone yet.
- Nearly!

1243
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,545
In fact, in three days.

1244
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:05,003
I'm not going as far as you.
Just to Megeve.

1245
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:07,128
It's a start.

1246
01:24:08,795 --> 01:24:11,628
- That woman?
- No, another one.

1247
01:24:14,003 --> 01:24:15,003
Is she pretty?

1248
01:24:16,045 --> 01:24:17,045
Beautiful!

1249
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:19,711
I see.

1250
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:23,170
Do you love her?

1251
01:24:27,253 --> 01:24:30,753
And you're sure about
this new diplomat of yours?

1252
01:24:30,836 --> 01:24:31,878
Somewhat!

1253
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:35,170
I'll give him a year to propose.

1254
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,836
That would annoy you, wouldn't it?

1255
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,545
That's how it goes.

1256
01:24:41,628 --> 01:24:42,920
Nice people,

1257
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:44,586
ball gowns,

1258
01:24:45,128 --> 01:24:46,670
cars,

1259
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:48,503
servants, everything.

1260
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:53,128
- You don't believe me?
- We'll see.

1261
01:24:53,211 --> 01:24:54,461
I've already seen.

1262
01:24:55,961 --> 01:24:57,545
You see...

1263
01:24:57,628 --> 01:24:59,545
It's not just having ball gowns.

1264
01:24:59,628 --> 01:25:01,086
It's having to wear them.

1265
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:04,586
You think I won't? I'm not pretty enough?
You think I'm ugly?

1266
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,545
I know people like that.
You won't feel comfortable.

1267
01:25:09,628 --> 01:25:11,711
And, if you do, then you'll be a snob.

1268
01:25:12,711 --> 01:25:14,170
Don't worry about me.

1269
01:25:15,003 --> 01:25:16,336
I can look out for myself.

1270
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:18,545
But that part of you will always be there.

1271
01:25:19,253 --> 01:25:22,086
The old you will always have feelings
for the stable boy.

1272
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,878
He deserved a slap in the face.

1273
01:25:37,503 --> 01:25:39,336
The professor's here. We'll operate.

1274
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,905
Operate?

1275
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,628
She won't die?

1276
01:25:42,711 --> 01:25:44,211
Save her.

1277
01:25:44,295 --> 01:25:46,711
Save her, I beg you.

1278
01:25:46,795 --> 01:25:51,586
Do everything you can.
My darling, come back.

1279
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:54,378
Fooled, all lies.

1280
01:25:55,378 --> 01:25:56,920
Fooled.

1281
01:25:57,003 --> 01:26:00,003
All lies. The bitch.

1282
01:26:00,086 --> 01:26:02,753
The conniving bitch!

1283
01:26:03,378 --> 01:26:06,711
Bitch!

1284
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:08,336
Lend me some money.

1285
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:14,336
I screwed up, I know.

1286
01:26:16,795 --> 01:26:19,128
We're selling tomorrow. I've nothing left.

1287
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:24,503
It's not for me. I don't care.
It's for her.

1288
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,253
Lend me all you can.

1289
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,003
Everything is ready.

1290
01:26:37,961 --> 01:26:39,753
Will it take long?

1291
01:26:39,836 --> 01:26:42,836
Everything I did for her.

1292
01:26:43,503 --> 01:26:46,795
I love her.

1293
01:26:46,878 --> 01:26:48,753
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

1294
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,920
The bitch. Filthy bitch!

1295
01:26:52,003 --> 01:26:53,878
Gently. Careful now.

1296
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,711
I'm quitting.

1297
01:27:01,795 --> 01:27:03,378
You don't want to work here?

1298
01:27:04,503 --> 01:27:07,211
No, impossible.
You can't help with the operation.

1299
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:13,378
Allow me. Please accept this.

1300
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:19,670
You can give it back to me later.
No need to explain. I can do it.

1301
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:22,128
Thank you.

1302
01:27:24,336 --> 01:27:25,336
Thank you.

1303
01:27:25,378 --> 01:27:27,920
I couldn't have known. I couldn't have.

1304
01:27:28,836 --> 01:27:30,211
Bitch!

1305
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,253
Give it here.
I'll put it in the bank in my name.

1306
01:27:34,336 --> 01:27:35,545
Yes.

1307
01:27:36,711 --> 01:27:37,878
Here.

1308
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:41,753
Put that in too. That's all I can spare.

1309
01:27:43,836 --> 01:27:45,003
Thank you.

1310
01:27:45,086 --> 01:27:47,795
Dora.

1311
01:27:49,545 --> 01:27:50,836
Dora.

1312
01:27:55,295 --> 01:27:57,336
Ah, bravo.

1313
01:28:05,878 --> 01:28:08,961
I love you.
You know very well that I love you.

1314
01:28:09,128 --> 01:28:11,586
Mother knows someone
who is a very good rider.

1315
01:28:12,378 --> 01:28:14,420
- Really very good.
- Whore!

1316
01:28:28,045 --> 01:28:29,795
I spent the night at mother's.

1317
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:39,586
Ruined me.
Destroyed everything, the bitch!

1318
01:28:39,753 --> 01:28:42,128
I can't watch that.
I'm going to my mother's.

1319
01:28:44,378 --> 01:28:45,961
I'm going to mother's.

1320
01:28:46,503 --> 01:28:50,545
Whore!

1321
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:52,878
Whore!

1322
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,003
Do you need anything?

1323
01:28:57,878 --> 01:28:59,586
They're operating right now.

1324
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:03,795
She was leaving. I'm sure she was leaving.

1325
01:29:12,586 --> 01:29:14,461
She was leaving.

1326
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:19,045
- They won't let me in.
- She was leaving.

1327
01:29:19,128 --> 01:29:21,336
Where was she going in the taxi? Where?

1328
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,753
It's too much. Leave me. Oh, my girl.

1329
01:29:23,836 --> 01:29:25,628
Where was she going? Where to?

1330
01:29:25,711 --> 01:29:27,878
Tell me. Was she leaving me?

1331
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:29,253
Yes, she was leaving.

1332
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:31,503
With all the money
she got towards the end.

1333
01:29:31,586 --> 01:29:35,295
You would never have seen her again.
And she was right to do it. Let me go!

1334
01:29:35,378 --> 01:29:39,253
Tell me everything.
You hear? Tell me everything.

1335
01:29:39,336 --> 01:29:40,836
Was she going to see Éric?

1336
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,753
Speak! Tell me!

1337
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:51,378
No, not him. It was the other one.

1338
01:29:51,461 --> 01:29:54,711
He was awful. Even uglier than you.

1339
01:29:54,795 --> 01:29:58,878
It fell apart with Éric
because he was a bastard, like all of you.

1340
01:29:58,961 --> 01:30:01,753
All of you!

1341
01:30:06,878 --> 01:30:10,045
Didn't he say anything? No warning at all?

1342
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:13,378
He told me he'd take me with him.

1343
01:30:15,586 --> 01:30:16,711
Ankara.

1344
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:21,170
So you would fall for him.
We've been fools.

1345
01:30:21,711 --> 01:30:23,170
He didn't have to.

1346
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:28,378
- It's all over now.
- No!

1347
01:30:28,461 --> 01:30:32,045
Don't get like this. It won't help.

1348
01:30:32,628 --> 01:30:36,961
Dora, my dear, we'll pull through.
It's just a bad turn.

1349
01:30:37,128 --> 01:30:39,545
I shouldn't have told her
that we're selling.

1350
01:30:39,628 --> 01:30:41,836
Get out of here. Leave her!

1351
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,545
It's your fault, after all.

1352
01:30:44,086 --> 01:30:45,586
Get out, I tell you!

1353
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:53,170
Dora, my little girl.

1354
01:30:53,253 --> 01:30:54,461
Dora.

1355
01:30:57,503 --> 01:30:59,878
The bastard, the pig!

1356
01:30:59,961 --> 01:31:02,670
Pig!

1357
01:31:03,503 --> 01:31:05,878
The things he sent me. There!

1358
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,211
For the horse, for me!

1359
01:31:08,295 --> 01:31:13,045
For me!
All for the horse! And the saddle too.

1360
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:15,836
Dora, that's from Hermes.

1361
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:18,170
To screw with me!

1362
01:31:19,878 --> 01:31:22,628
He's gone.

1363
01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:25,586
François too.

1364
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:28,920
We've nothing left.

1365
01:31:30,795 --> 01:31:32,295
Nothing.

1366
01:31:32,378 --> 01:31:34,961
We've still got a little money set aside.

1367
01:31:43,503 --> 01:31:45,878
Introduce me to the vegetable salesman.

1368
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:49,336
That'll work. If he's got money,
it'll be hard for the others.

1369
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:53,253
I want to see him tomorrow, you hear?
Tomorrow! There's no time to lose.

1370
01:31:53,336 --> 01:31:56,878
That'll work out, I'm sure.

1371
01:31:58,003 --> 01:32:01,003
I swear it'll work out.

1372
01:32:01,086 --> 01:32:02,836
He loved her the moment he saw her.

1373
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,420
He furnished an apartment
just before the sale.

1374
01:32:05,503 --> 01:32:06,753
We would have been happy.

1375
01:32:06,836 --> 01:32:09,003
With what we had
and what he would give her,

1376
01:32:09,086 --> 01:32:11,420
we could manage
and look for someone better.

1377
01:32:11,503 --> 01:32:13,878
She was heading there
when she had the accident.

1378
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:17,836
- I was there getting things ready for her.
- She left me without saying a word.

1379
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,253
You had nothing left.
She wasn't going to stay!

1380
01:32:34,378 --> 01:32:36,378
If she lives, won't you do anything?

1381
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:37,836
No, not now.

1382
01:32:38,628 --> 01:32:40,336
If she had told me herself, maybe.

1383
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:43,045
She wanted to do it before leaving,
to see your face.

1384
01:32:43,128 --> 01:32:46,128
- She got scared at the last minute.
- That was better.

1385
01:32:47,253 --> 01:32:50,795
I may have killed her.
She didn't even deserve that.

1386
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:53,461
Not even being killed.

1387
01:32:53,545 --> 01:32:55,920
It's all finished. It's ruined.

1388
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:57,961
You're just leaving?

1389
01:32:58,045 --> 01:32:59,170
No.

1390
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,836
I'll wait for the results.

1391
01:33:25,711 --> 01:33:27,211
Is she alive?

1392
01:33:27,295 --> 01:33:29,336
Tell me, I'm her mother.

1393
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:32,253
Will she live? Tell me, will she live?

1394
01:33:32,336 --> 01:33:33,586
Yes, she'll live.

1395
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,545
But she's paralyzed.

1396
01:33:37,336 --> 01:33:38,795
You understand? Paralyzed.

1397
01:33:39,711 --> 01:33:41,378
For the rest of her days.

1398
01:33:41,461 --> 01:33:42,670
She'll never walk again.

1399
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:44,420
Never.

1400
01:33:46,336 --> 01:33:48,628
They don't even know
if she'll be able to talk.

1401
01:33:49,378 --> 01:33:51,295
Her central nervous system is damaged.

1402
01:33:55,045 --> 01:33:57,503
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

1403
01:33:58,378 --> 01:33:59,503
- No!
- Yes.

1404
01:33:59,586 --> 01:34:03,253
The other man won't want her either.
No one will want her now.

1405
01:34:04,586 --> 01:34:05,753
Not even me.

1406
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:09,795
She'll be all yours
for the rest of your life.

1407
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:12,378
You heard me.

1408
01:34:14,336 --> 01:34:16,128
No, I don't want that!

1409
01:34:17,586 --> 01:34:19,836
Help us. Don't leave her.

1410
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,128
She loves you. It wasn't true.
None of that was true.

1411
01:34:23,211 --> 01:34:26,253
Don't leave, Robert!

1412
01:34:26,336 --> 01:34:29,795
Robert!

1413
01:34:29,878 --> 01:34:33,670
Robert, come back! Robert!

1414
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:35,253
What will happen to us?

1415
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:38,920
You'll take care of her like a good mother
with the money you set aside.

1416
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,253
- You can push her wheelchair.
- Robert.

1417
01:34:42,336 --> 01:34:44,211
What am I going to do?

1418
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:46,711
The money, Robert.

1419
01:34:46,878 --> 01:34:48,045
Robert!

1420
01:34:48,128 --> 01:34:51,461
You can't abandon your wife.

1421
01:34:52,295 --> 01:34:53,586
She's an invalid.

1422
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:57,045
Bastard! Filthy coward! Coward! Bastard!

1423
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:59,586
He's gone. Robert.

1424
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:02,461
It's always us who are the victims.

1425
01:35:03,211 --> 01:35:04,961
Our hearts that get broken.

1426
01:35:05,045 --> 01:35:07,420
Robert, what am I going to do?

1427
01:35:08,753 --> 01:35:10,295
What am I going to do?

1428
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:22,295
THE END
