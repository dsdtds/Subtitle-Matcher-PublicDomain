1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,478
- 18 hours out.

2
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,648
Destination unknown.

3
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,899
A military secret.

4
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,319
The largest overseas expedition

5
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:12,198
ever discarded by the blue
ensign at the American Navy.

6
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,503
Southwards from Britain,

7
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,713
some 3,000 miles away,

8
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,924
an even greater convoy twice the size

9
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,427
moves in its appointed
place across the seas.

10
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:36,472
Shielded by the white
ensign of the British navy.

11
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,474
Destroyers in close support,

12
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,852
cruisers on the flanks,
and beyond the horizon,

13
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:42,895
the battleships.

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,940
From the decks of aircraft carriers

15
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,905
and from the shore, planes
of the fleet air arm

16
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:56,951
and Costal Command patrol the
skies and search the skies.

17
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,121
Advance outposts of an
elaborate protective screen.

18
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,875
- East
nor'east, the American convoy.

19
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,796
- Sou'west
by west, the British.

20
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:13,426
Nothing like these two armadas
had disturbed the waters

21
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,304
since the world was made.

22
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,347
This is a combined operation.

23
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,475
An operation that began
some four months earlier

24
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:22,768
in Washington DC.

25
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,648
The President of the United States

26
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,443
welcomed the Prime
Minister of Great Britain.

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,321
The gravity of the moment
had brought them together.

28
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,199
The lights burned all night
that night in the White House

29
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,118
where the two leaders met with their

30
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,870
combined chiefs of staffs.

31
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:45,916
For this was the picture
taking all too-definite form

32
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,544
in the minds of the civil,
military, and naval leaders

33
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,297
now locked in secret conference.

34
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,175
Two Axis spearheads were headed east.

35
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,594
In the north, von Bach was hewing his way

36
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,554
through the Ukraine to the Caucuses.

37
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,973
In the south, Rommel was driving toward

38
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,058
the Egyptian border.

39
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,187
These two spearheads were
intended to meet in Iran

40
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,731
and head eastwards towards India.

41
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,943
In the orient, Japan had
occupied the coast of China,

42
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,613
the East Indies, Malaya, and Burma.

43
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,783
In preparation for the drive
westward through India.

44
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,871
If these two enemy spearheads
were allowed to meet,

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,667
Russia and China, except for
their remote arctic ports,

46
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,835
would be completely isolated.

47
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,380
Japanese raw materials
and German production

48
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,589
would be combined.

49
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,384
The peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa,

50
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,970
7/8ths of the world's
population, would be enslaved.

51
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,310
By morning a decision.

52
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,312
Both bold and revolutionary.

53
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,773
Bold because in this our darkest hour

54
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,817
we dared to take the offensive.

55
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,529
Revolutionary because that
offensive was conceived,

56
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,990
planned, and executed by
the peoples of two nations.

57
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,035
The time and the place
had been agreed upon.

58
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,875
Code name of the combined
operation was Acrobat.

59
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,462
The two great elements
were time and secrecy.

60
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,676
125 days in which to plan
and launch an offensive

61
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,053
from bases 3,000 miles apart.

62
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,473
An operation involving
hundreds of thousands

63
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:27,351
of American and British
soldiers and sailors.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,855
Millions of American and
British working men and women.

65
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,607
Only by whose combined
efforts could the plan

66
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,401
become a reality.

67
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,487
But from whom the plan
itself must be kept secret.

68
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,449
A few score men and no more

69
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,576
knew in its entirety the plan for this

70
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,036
greatest of combined operations.

71
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,998
In London and Washington,
British and American officers

72
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,708
were placed at adjoining desks

73
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,794
to work through the days
and nights of grind and toil

74
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,045
that lay ahead.

75
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,007
And gradually in the
enforced daily intimacy,

76
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,634
men grew to know and respect each other.

77
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,887
Thus was born the
relationship out of which

78
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,431
an Allied army came into being.

79
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,017
To them came hourly reports
on the vast undertaking

80
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,728
of forging the striking weapon.

81
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,313
It was a race against time.

82
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,246
In the United States, men
and supplies poured eastward

83
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,747
toward the Atlantic seaboard.

84
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,224
- In
Britain also, by road and rail,

85
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,851
an army was on the move.

86
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,161
By day and night, the dockers worked.

87
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,456
Records were broken in tonnage
put aboard in one shift.

88
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,085
For every soldier, British and American,

89
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,004
10 tons of equipment.

90
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,433
On both sides of the Atlantic,
the effort was tremendous.

91
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,479
Guns, trucks, aircraft,
petrol, water, food,

92
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,733
barbed wires, locomotives.

93
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:26,697
Of ammunition alone we
shipped 520 different kinds.

94
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,165
And every ship sailed on time.

95
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,542
And in absolute secrecy.

96
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,685
- And the convoy

97
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:03,145
continued its hidden way.

98
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:08,442
- My name is McAdams, Joe McAdams.

99
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,402
Kansas City, Kansas.

100
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,029
Private first class.

101
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,449
I was on one of those
ships you're looking at.

102
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,160
Part of the biggest show on
Earth and didn't know it.

103
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,288
Too darn many ships to see all at once.

104
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,626
Well, we'd been hollering for action,

105
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,628
now we were gonna get it.

106
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,338
But we didn't know where.

107
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,673
Norway, France, Italy, China.

108
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,685
Finally, on the fifth day we got the news.

109
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,771
I mean what we been waiting to hear.

110
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,815
They handed out little guide books

111
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,025
and I remember the first line,

112
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,611
you are to do duty in North Africa

113
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,405
as a soldier of the United States.

114
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,615
Gave me kind of a kick.

115
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,827
- Why North Africa?

116
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,745
What was the plan called Acrobat?

117
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,457
The convoy from America was heading east.

118
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,209
The one from Britain heading south.

119
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,586
At a given point west of Gibraltar

120
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,214
the British convoy would divide.

121
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,466
For 12 hours the two halves would proceed

122
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,468
in opposite directions.

123
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,096
Then the second half
would reverse its course

124
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,347
and follow the first.

125
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,892
Passing Gibraltar 24 hours behind.

126
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,979
Thus with clock-like precision

127
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,939
the combined operations would begin

128
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,775
with simultaneous landings at Casablanca,

129
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,613
Oran, Algiers.

130
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,993
Casablanca to protect our
flank against an Axis attack

131
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,036
through Spanish Morocco.

132
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,831
Oran and Algiers to secure bases

133
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,332
from which to press eastward.

134
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,003
Then the occupation of Tunisia,

135
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,007
from which we could cut
Rommel's supply lines

136
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,425
across the Mediterranean.

137
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,429
Next trap and destroy
Rommel's Afrika Korps

138
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,139
between our Allied forces

139
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,141
and the British Eighth Army.

140
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,728
- Thus
one arm of the Axis pincer

141
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,606
would be amputated, and supply lines

142
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,192
around the Cape of Good Hope
would be shortened by half

143
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,444
through winning control
of the Mediterranean.

144
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,197
North Africa would be
ours with bases from which

145
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,325
to stab at the heart of the Axis citadel.

146
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,871
Those were the main objectives
of the plan called Acrobat.

147
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,332
In both convoys, the men kept fit,

148
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,001
now knowing the task that lay ahead.

149
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,213
For most of them this
voyage was a new experience.

150
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,716
They'd never been so far from home before.

151
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,426
- That's certainly true of me.

152
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,053
My name's George Metcalfe.

153
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,805
I was a greengrocer in civvy street,

154
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,557
we had a shop a long time.

155
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,601
Only we're a military family, really.

156
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,230
My dad was at Passchendaele
and I was at Dunkirk.

157
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,981
Never met such a collection of blokes

158
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,816
as we got on this ship.

159
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,820
Chaps from Glasgow, New
York, London, Melbourne,

160
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,116
Cape Town, Montreal, Chicago,
Birmingham, Wellington,

161
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,786
Bethnal Green, the whole issue.

162
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,955
I reckon it's about time
this team of internationals

163
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,915
got cracking.

164
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,833
When I was peeling spuds just now

165
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,086
I made up quite a letter to my girl.

166
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,129
All about the way these ships zigzag

167
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,882
and about flying fish and whales.

168
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,676
Course we haven't seen any yet,

169
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,387
but I reckon she'll like to
know I'm enjoying myself.

170
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,431
And now I got something
else to tell her too,

171
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,267
the best news for a long time,

172
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,435
they just put it up on the ship's board.

173
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,780
- But
the Eighth Army's offensive

174
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,031
was only one phase

175
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,449
of a larger strategy.

176
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,829
Included therein, the bombings of Genoa,

177
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,292
Naples, Turin.

178
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,007
Precision bombings of the Renault factory

179
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,050
turning out Rommel's tanks.

180
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,012
All these a part of
the plan called Acrobat

181
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,056
of which the enemy still knew nothing.

182
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,684
Nothing of the submarine trip to Africa

183
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,145
by General Mark Clark with a message

184
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,147
to be smuggled into France.

185
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,358
Nothing of the arrival at
Gibraltar of General Eisenhower,

186
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,486
where he was joined by
General Henri Giraud

187
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,073
who had received General
Clark's smuggled message.

188
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,826
The enemy knew nothing until
the last possible moment

189
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,454
when the first half of
the convoy from Britain

190
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,248
steamed past the fortress of Gibraltar.

191
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,209
- It was
at night that the ships passed

192
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,753
through the Straits.

193
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,838
The time had been carefully chosen

194
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,882
for here in narrow waters

195
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,134
attack seemed certain.

196
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:47,971
Aboard ship and on the
rock, everyone stood to,

197
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,766
but the ships moved steadily on.

198
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,436
It was as though for the
moment the enemy's sword

199
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,230
had fallen from his
hand through indecision.

200
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,071
This time, it was in Rome and in Berlin

201
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,489
that the lights burned all night.

202
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,241
For the first time since
the war's beginning,

203
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,411
somebody else was calling the tune.

204
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,372
But before the enemy
could collect its wits

205
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,541
or its forces, our ships lay as planned

206
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,293
off their appointed destination.

207
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:28,136
Events planned four months
earlier moved to a climax.

208
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,809
Off Casablanca stood
the convoy from America.

209
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:38,522
To the troops aboard spoke
their commander General Patton.

210
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,316
Soldiers and sailors.

211
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,777
It is not known whether
the French African army

212
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,029
will contest our landing.

213
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,282
But all resistance by whomever offered

214
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,742
must be destroyed.

215
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,371
However, when any of the French soldiers

216
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,540
seek to surrender, you will accept it

217
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,292
and treat them with the respect

218
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,337
due a brave opponent and future ally.

219
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:05,799
Remember, the French
are not Nazis or Japs.

220
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,304
November the 8th, 1942.

221
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,140
Orders of the day.

222
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,892
The words play ball
transmitted by the task force

223
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,979
commanders signifies that
all forces are to take

224
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,023
vigorous and offensive
action against the enemy.

225
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,026
A large searchlight shown in
a vertical position at night

226
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,820
signifies that the enemy has agreed

227
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,238
to the terms of the Allies.

228
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,017
Zero hour.

229
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,395
From America, the president
broadcast by short wave.

230
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,355
We do not want your land.

231
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,483
We fight a common enemy.

232
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,986
From London, General Charles
de Gaulle, do not resist.

233
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,656
From Gibraltar, General Giraud.

234
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,783
We welcome the Allies to French soil.

235
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,495
How would these pleas be answered?

236
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,060
- Play ball.

237
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,651
- The
fight was on in Casablanca.

238
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:49,694
- In the meantime,

239
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,446
at Algiers our landing craft

240
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,323
also met fire from shore batteries

241
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:56,743
which were soon silenced by
ships of the British navy.

242
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,793
Here too the French troops ashore

243
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,837
were asked by radio to
indicate a friendly attitude

244
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:10,966
by throwing their
searchlight beams vertical.

245
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,177
It wasn't long before here
and there along the coast,

246
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,763
searchlights were seen
pointing to the heavens.

247
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,435
As dawn broke, fighter
planes from Gibraltar

248
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,271
fitted with extra fuel tanks

249
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,106
took off without even waiting to hear

250
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,984
whether the landing fields
at Algiers had been captured.

251
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,949
By seven AM, resistance
at Algiers was finished.

252
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,660
British and American troops had landed

253
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,328
east and west of the city,

254
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,581
penetrated 10 to 15 miles

255
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,667
and held the heights
and all vantage points.

256
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,837
In Algiers on that famous November the 8th

257
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,797
was Admiral Jean Darlan,

258
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,592
French Vice Chief of State
under Marshal Petain.

259
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,511
It was after consultation with him

260
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,305
that the French commanding general

261
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,056
agreed to surrender the city.

262
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,892
- Meanwhile, at Oran.

263
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,741
American paratroops and airborne infantry

264
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,577
flown from Britain 1500 miles away

265
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,245
had landed to capture airfields

266
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:25,915
while other American troops had
poured ashore on the beaches

267
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,709
protected by the British navy.

268
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,629
Here as in Algiers the fighting lasted

269
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,464
for only a few hours.

270
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,258
But at Casablanca the battle still raged.

271
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,180
Shore batteries and the heavy guns

272
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,391
of the French battleship Jean Bart

273
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,310
and several cruisers,
destroyers, and gun boats

274
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,770
put out a devastating fire.

275
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,280
Gunnery from American ships
coupled with precision bombing

276
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,032
silenced those guns.

277
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,877
Striking inland from the
beaches north and south

278
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,046
of the city, shock
troops cut the railways,

279
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,965
other lines of communication,

280
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,884
then converged upon the town.

281
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,898
Two days later, the Germans
invaded unoccupied France.

282
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,734
Whereupon Admiral Darlan declaring Petain

283
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:00,820
a prisoner of the Axis
and himself Chief of State

284
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,406
ordered the cessation of hostilities.

285
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:07,160
In proof of the surprise of our landings,

286
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,829
German armistice commissions
were caught flat-footed

287
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,414
in each city.

288
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,793
Their jobs, to bleed North
Africa of her raw materials

289
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,211
and farm products.

290
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,339
The people of North Africa were evidently

291
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,591
not sorry to see them go.

292
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,725
- Events moved swiftly.

293
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,311
To Algiers came General Anderson

294
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,855
commanding the British First Army.

295
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,858
General Giraud took command
of the French land forces.

296
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,860
United under General Eisenhower,

297
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,779
they were ready to take the field.

298
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,782
Once more the Tricolour,
the Stars and Stripes,

299
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,034
the Union Jack flew side by side.

300
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,712
But the enemy had lost no time.

301
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,965
Across the Mediterranean by sea and by air

302
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:06,010
he was pouring men and equipment
into Tunis and Bizerte.

303
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,059
Despite this, we determined
to start the campaign at once,

304
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:16,396
hoping to reach the distant
cities before the enemy's grasp

305
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,231
had become too strong.

306
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,983
This was a bold decision

307
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,360
for the British First Army
was as yet little more

308
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,572
than one division and the
bulk of the American forces

309
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,950
were needed to safeguard
our position in Morocco.

310
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,827
We had other disadvantages.

311
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:31,953
Roads were poor.

312
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,039
Railways inadequate.

313
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,550
The enemy beyond the mountains
had short supply lines

314
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,635
from Sicily and Sardinia.

315
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,096
Our own, stretching
forward from the improvised

316
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:53,766
base at Algiers were
four times the length.

317
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:57,395
Even more important, we lacked
as yet forward air fields

318
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,148
whereas the enemy in Tunisia had all

319
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,650
of the permanent air fields he needed.

320
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,570
In less than a month
the weather would break.

321
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,198
Could our slender force,
in the last days of autumn,

322
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:12,118
achieve a flashing success against time

323
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,786
and a stronger enemy?

324
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,248
With immense energy the attempt was made.

325
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,045
By road, Allied infantry,
tanks, and artillery

326
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,504
moved towards the hills.

327
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,717
By rail went General
Giraud's men with mules

328
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:28,968
for mountain transport.

329
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:34,140
By air flew British and
American parachutists

330
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,559
to capture suitable ground for air fields

331
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,186
and the tactical points nearby.

332
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:57,497
By sea went commandos to Bougie and Bonn.

333
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,749
The latter 300 miles to the east

334
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,961
and only 60 miles from
the Tunisian border.

335
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,755
Here the air field which
our parachutists have taken

336
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,299
was already under attack
from the Luftwaffe.

337
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,370
It was our only permanent
forward air field

338
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,247
and had to be fought for repeatedly.

339
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:46,004
In three columns we advanced
towards Tunis and Bizerte.

340
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,340
And still the enemy poured into Africa.

341
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,426
By mid-November 1,000 a day.

342
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,722
Among them Marshal
Kesselring, Mediterranean

343
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,973
Commander in Chief.

344
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,225
The man who had made his name infamous

345
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,518
at Warsaw and Rotterdam.

346
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:05,106
November the 18th, 10 days
after our first landings,

347
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,858
our mixed force of Allied troops

348
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,401
had crossed the frontier into Tunisia

349
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,695
and skirmishes were frequent.

350
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,298
On we went.

351
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,217
Small units of French, British, Americans.

352
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,304
Held out here, gaining
there, fighting roads

353
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,515
as well as Germans but pushing on.

354
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:43,019
By November the 22nd, we were in Beja.

355
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,230
450 miles on the road to Tunis.

356
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,026
News came that 30 miles on
the French under General Barre

357
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,445
were holding Medjez el
Bab against the Germans.

358
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,198
The French were fighting stubbornly,

359
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,950
equipped with little more
than machine guns and rifles.

360
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,953
General Anderson promptly
moved to support them.

361
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,795
Together we held Medjez,
henceforth a pivotal point,

362
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,880
and forced the Germans back.

363
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,799
But now we went into the plains

364
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,967
and were increasingly
exposed to the enemy's

365
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,136
more numerous tanks and aircraft.

366
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,229
November the 25th, the
first real tank clash.

367
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:52,505
15 enemy tanks destroyed
and the rest withdrew.

368
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,842
And on we push towards Tunis and Bizerte.

369
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,885
Racing against time and the weather.

370
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,014
60 miles from Bizerte, 50 miles.

371
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,142
40 miles.

372
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,352
Our supply lines inexorably thinning,

373
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:08,813
our reinforcements fewer and fewer.

374
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,606
30 miles from Bizerte.

375
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:11,941
20 miles.

376
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,943
18 miles from Tunis.

377
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,320
16,15.

378
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,866
And from the hills, our
patrols saw the city.

379
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:22,618
But now the enemy attack

380
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,036
rose to a crescendo.

381
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,296
From the skies a
bombardment to which we had

382
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:37,425
no adequate answer.

383
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:08,289
Our supplies were far outrun.

384
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,125
Our casualties heavy.

385
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,630
Even as the goal was in
sight, the race had been lost.

386
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,551
This first thrust, this
adventurous gamble had failed.

387
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,805
We fell back to the
protection of the hills.

388
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,483
But even as we withdrew
to regroup our forces

389
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,693
we encountered a new enemy.

390
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:40,196
Winter was upon us.

391
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,326
Our hastily-improvised
air fields were flooded.

392
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,869
Our planes earthbound.

393
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,129
The roads became running streams.

394
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,846
Our tanks immobilized.

395
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,598
All hopes of a quick victory

396
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,142
had finally foundered in a sea of mud.

397
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,898
But the race for Tunis and
Bizerte had not been in vain.

398
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,360
For our battle lines now stabilized,

399
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,029
ran south from Medjez el Bab

400
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:26,534
through Ousseltia, Faid,
Maknassy, and Gafsa.

401
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,037
Along the barrier ridge of mountains known

402
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,498
as the Great Dorsal which separated

403
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,792
the German-occupied coastal plain

404
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,461
from the mountainous regions to the west.

405
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,672
German expansion was possible only through

406
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,800
a series of passes
traversing the Great Dorsal.

407
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,427
And all through the winter months,

408
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,472
we held those passes against
incessant German attack.

409
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,898
This was the period
referred to by the world

410
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,859
as one of military inactivity.

411
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,950
A period during which
we sustained nearly half

412
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,745
the total casualties
incurred during the whole

413
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,497
North African campaign.

414
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,082
- That's right.

415
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:17,168
When you're reading
your papers about lulls,

416
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,753
that don't apply to George Metcalfe

417
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,296
and the poor bloody infantry.

418
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,964
It never did.

419
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,591
We're on the job every night.

420
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,968
Patrols in the hills and in the woods.

421
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:39,982
Off we go with some brands and tommy guns

422
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,567
and a few loose bombs

423
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,819
and if we're lucky we scupper a few Jerrys

424
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,905
and bring a few prisoners in.

425
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,282
Old Fred Parker's the
best, he was a poacher.

426
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,992
It's second nature to old Fred.

427
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,922
When we get back we're camouflaged

428
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,924
so you can't tell whether we're men

429
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,717
or walking lumps of mud.

430
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,386
We picked up about half of Tunisia

431
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,304
when we got back this morning.

432
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:11,597
And we'd just about scraped it off

433
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,099
when we had to go out again at dusk

434
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,809
and pick up the other half.

435
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,186
Great life.

436
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,980
You'd think mud'd be different in Africa.

437
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,233
Different from France, say.

438
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,110
Old Fred says it weighs heavier here

439
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,277
and don't smell the same

440
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:26,987
but me I can't tell any difference.

441
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,906
It turns white bread into brown

442
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,950
just like the other stuff.

443
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,203
Keeping your automatics and
rifles clean is the worst.

444
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:37,873
Old Fred's only got about
half a tail of his shirt left.

445
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:41,085
There's one thing we do
thank God for, the mules,

446
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,294
fancy that.

447
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:43,629
Mules.

448
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,715
If it wasn't for the mules
we'd just about starve.

449
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,592
Not that we eat 'em, I don't mean that,

450
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,095
but they bring up the rations, see.

451
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,598
Nothing but mules or
eagles could ever get here.

452
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,517
Mud, just mud.

453
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,770
I told my girl I'll stick to her like mud

454
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,106
and I can say more than that.

455
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:07,987
- Whenever
the fields were dry enough,

456
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,823
our planes took off to
tackle the Luftwaffe.

457
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,741
Though still outnumbered, in four weeks

458
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,411
they shot down 241 enemy aircraft

459
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,122
for a loss of 89 of our own.

460
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:28,757
Further back, day after day,

461
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:30,926
the Strategic Air Force was taking off

462
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:33,471
to kill the enemy's effort
at its starting point.

463
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,682
Liberators from the east.

464
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,810
Fortresses from the west.

465
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,813
Went forth to destroy
enemy bases in Italy.

466
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:46,484
Sardinia.

467
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:47,401
Sicily.

468
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,401
But on land, no offensive
could be launched until spring.

469
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,821
Against its coming there
was to be on either side

470
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,699
of the Great Dorsal a
building up of power.

471
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,041
Over supply routes that
spanned on the German side

472
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,877
150 miles of water and on our side

473
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,379
hundreds of miles of land

474
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,048
and then thousands of miles of water.

475
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,175
The longest assembly lines in the world

476
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:54,510
were in operation.

477
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,179
From the factories of the
United States and Britain.

478
00:34:58,097 --> 00:34:59,807
From Birmingham to Algiers.

479
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,269
From Detroit to Iran.

480
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:06,605
From Manchester, Los Angeles, from Leeds,

481
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,524
from Pittsburgh to Casablanca.

482
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:39,430
Full trains were assembled on the spot,

483
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,390
loaded with freight, and sent forth.

484
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:49,690
The south Atlantic became an
airway as well as a seaway.

485
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,818
From Brazil flights of
P-38s equipped with extra

486
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:55,279
fuel tanks were flown across the seas.

487
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,825
Each flight led by a Flying Fortress

488
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:01,285
which provided navigation.

489
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,709
From Gibraltar, aircraft
which had been brought by ship

490
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,461
from Britain and reassembled on the rock

491
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,880
were flown off to Chamaze.

492
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,133
Nearly 1500 planes reached
the front by this route.

493
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,475
Roads to the front were being built

494
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,310
where none before existed.

495
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,444
On wet, still-unfinished landing strips,

496
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,988
giant planes sat down
with cargoes of material.

497
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,370
Our reservoir of power was filling up.

498
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:02,054
Tunisia was to be the
theater of a major campaign,

499
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,973
a campaign to be fought
where Scipio had fought,

500
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:06,558
and Hannibal.

501
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,644
Where already three times in history

502
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,604
great armies had been destroyed between

503
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,564
the mountains and the sea.

504
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:14,942
These hills and plains were again to echo

505
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,694
to the tempest of battle.

506
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,821
Not now the trumpeting of elephants,

507
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,782
but the crash of tanks and artillery.

508
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,245
Not now an empire, but
way of life at stake.

509
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:32,626
♪ Oh come let us adore him ♪

510
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:37,715
♪ Oh come let us adore him ♪

511
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,885
♪ Christ the lord ♪

512
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:11,832
- On this Christmas
1942, our soldiers and airmen

513
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,376
in Tunisia at the western desert

514
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,295
gather together in little churches

515
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,921
or under the open sky.

516
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:23,427
And doing so, they thought
of their homes and loved ones

517
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,263
hundreds or thousands of miles away.

518
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,895
Our soldiers thoughts were of
New York and the Middle West.

519
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,815
Of the cities and villages of France.

520
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,901
The plains and hills of India.

521
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:42,529
Of homes in Cape Town
and the African veldt.

522
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,574
Or among the snows of Canada,

523
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,368
or in the Christmas sunshine

524
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:50,287
of New Zealand and Australia.

525
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:54,833
And among the fog and rain
of London and Edinburgh.

526
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:56,502
And they thought of their comrades

527
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,920
who had already been killed

528
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:02,007
and of the cause for
which they'd been killed,

529
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:04,635
the cause that had brought
all them across the seas

530
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,094
to fight.

531
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:11,141
The cause of liberty and
tolerance and dignity and peace.

532
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,231
And of how the horizon
was brightening a little,

533
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,358
as though a new day were being born.

534
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,167
- A lot of us guys
got packages at Christmas.

535
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,794
You know what was in mine?

536
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,504
Stuffed dates.

537
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:25,549
Stuffed dates in Africa
under the date palms.

538
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,550
Can you beat that?

539
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,595
One good thing about Christmas,

540
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,847

541
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,016

552
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,420
Everybody fed well at Christmas.

553
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,090
Including the pets.

554
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,404
Along about now we began
to take notice of the kids.

555
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,365
First off they were kinda shy.

556
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,910
But Arab kids are no different
from the kids back home

557
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,120
when it comes to candy.

558
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:28,171
A lot of them look about half starved.

559
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,590
The Germans had picked the land clean.

560
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:34,052
So we gave half our milk
ration to the Red Cross,

561
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:35,345
they ladled it out.

562
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,478
Off-duty we just roamed around, looked.

563
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,942
And we saw some mighty strange sights.

564
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,634
We wondered what the
Moorish girls looked like

565
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,595
behind their veils.

566
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,805
Wondering was about as far as we got.

567
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:21,224
One Sunday.

568
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,229
The middle of January.

569
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:31,735
We were hanging around,

570
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,487
catching up on the news from home.

571
00:43:36,073 --> 00:43:37,741
When we were roaded out for assembly.

572
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,495
They told us to polish our
brass and shine our leather.

573
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,831
Some of us said, what's the big idea?

574
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,876
Well, we found out.

575
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:51,755
And you coulda knocked
me over with a tank.

576
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,715
It was the prez himself.

577
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:55,175
Riding along in a jeep.

578
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,605
When we saw Mr. Churchill come
in, not puffing his cigar,

579
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:10,607
we knew something big was cooking.

580
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,819
- In
a small seaside hotel

581
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,780
at Casablanca, discussions began at once.

582
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,574
Their purpose, to design
the shape of victory

583
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,743
in Africa and beyond.

584
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:24,037
First, a meeting was arranged between

585
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:25,372
Generals de Gaulle and Giraud

586
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,124
who had succeeded Admiral Darlan,

587
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,834
assassinated a month earlier.

588
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,460
Out of the meeting was to grow the union

589
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,796
of a fighting French
who had never lost hope

590
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,966
and the French for whom
hope had been reborn.

591
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:39,553
Second, the united command
for the new Tunisian campaign

592
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:40,720
was created.

593
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:43,056
The Allied troops in the
area were now predominantly

594
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,183
British, but by common agreement,

595
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:48,979
General Eisenhower continued
in supreme command.

596
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,149
As his deputy commanders,
three British officers.

597
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,859
General Alexander on land,

598
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,278
Admiral Cunningham on sea,

599
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,030
Air Chief Marshal Tedder in the air.

600
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,951
Under them, British, American,
and French officers and men

601
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,578
serving side by side.

602
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,955
The whole scheme a dovetailing of command

603
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:09,416
unique in military campaigns.

604
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,878
Third, we fixed the terms
which would end the fighting.

605
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,880
Unconditional surrender.

606
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,092
Of all these decisions, our
Russian and Chinese allies

607
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,094
were kept fully informed.

608
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,347
The conference ended, Mr.
Churchill flew on to Tripoli

609
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,850
to greet the victorious Eighth Army.

610
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,644
And explain its vital part
in forthcoming events.

611
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,232
For the decisive hour was at hand.

612
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:37,194
Battle lines were drawn.

613
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,531
In the north stood the British First Army.

614
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,618
In the center, General
Giraud's French troops.

615
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,995
In the south, the Americans.

616
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:49,331
Further south, a small
group of fighting French

617
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:52,250
had completed its historic 1500 mile march

618
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,294
and taken up positions on the left flank

619
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:55,754
of the British Eighth Army

620
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,089
which faced the formidable Mareth Line.

621
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,343
Behind which barrier Rommel's army,

622
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:04,846
after its long retreat,
had entrenched itself.

623
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,099
Tunisia was gray with German troops.

624
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,726
15 full divisions.

625
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,237
No scratch troops these.

626
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:24,074
But battle-wise veterans of
Poland, France, the Balkans.

627
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,744
They, together with
seven Italian divisions,

628
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,580
were armed with the most
modern types of equipment,

629
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,499
including the newest fighters and bombers

630
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,501
of the German Luftwaffe.

631
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:38,630
The German orders were
hold Tunisia at all costs.

632
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,882
Keep control of the Mediterranean.

633
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,551
Rommel, standing behind

634
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,886
his Mareth Line,

635
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:47,722
saw that he must soon be faced
with an attack in the rear

636
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,225
from the Allied armies
along the Great Dorsal

637
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,436
as well as an assault by
the Eighth Army at Mareth.

638
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:56,898
He therefore struck first
in an endeavor to remove

639
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,191
the menace behind him.

640
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,196
On February the 14th, the blow was struck.

641
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:05,740
Heavy armored columns
burst out of Faid Pass

642
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,325
in the mountain barrier

643
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,160
and through into the valley beyond.

644
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,914
In the face of their onslaught,

645
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:15,500
Allied armor withdrew with heavy losses.

646
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,962
By the 21st, the enemy had forced his way

647
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,630
through the Kasserine Pass

648
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,549
and his armored columns were advancing

649
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,759
in a three-pronged thrust.

650
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,304
One main column aimed at Tebessa,

651
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,389
our supply base in southern Tunisia,

652
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,765
and another at Thala,

653
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:33,143
key town in our lines of communication.

654
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,270
Almost within sight of his objective,

655
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,063
he was halted.

656
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,316
American, British, and French forces

657
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,402
all stood immovable
against the final impact

658
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,070
and in counterattack broke it

659
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:46,906
while Allied airpower pounded Rommel's

660
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:49,701
lines of communication and supply.

661
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,036
The threat was ended.

662
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,664
Advancing past destroyed German armor,

663
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,666
we reoccupied Kasserine Pass

664
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:00,295
and by March the 17th,
the original battle lines

665
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,963
had been restored.

666
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,258
As soon as Rommel saw
that his westward thrust

667
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:08,345
was doomed, he made an
abortive attack south

668
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,096
against the Eighth Army.

669
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:12,974
The Germans unveiled the new Tiger tank.

670
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:16,186
The British, the new
17-pounder anti-tank gun.

671
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,402
52 Tiger tanks were left burning husks.

672
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,822
From then on the initiative was ours.

673
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,535
- Of
the various strategies

674
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,163
which might now be
employed against the enemy,

675
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:37,582
General Eisenhower chose
one which envisaged

676
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,292
the entire military situation

677
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:41,378
in terms of a cylinder.

678
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,422
The western wall, Allied land forces along

679
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:45,507
the Great Dorsal.

680
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,427
The northern and eastern,
Allied air and sea power

681
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,971
concentrated in the Mediterranean.

682
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,391
The seaports of Tunis
and Bizerte were to act

683
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,435
as the intake valve through
which those enemy troops

684
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:59,896
that escaped the
devastating attack of planes

685
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:02,357
and submarines based at Malta were to be

686
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,150
sucked into the cylinder.

687
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,277
At the bottom of the
cylinder stood the powerful

688
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:07,529
British Eighth Army

689
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:11,366
to serve as the piston
which, in its upward stroke,

690
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,536
would push the enemy into
an ever-smaller space.

691
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,580
Still in possession of the
enemy were certain high hills

692
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,833
to the west of Tunis and Bizerte.

693
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,836
Their capture was an essential
part of the entire strategy

694
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,338
for these hills were the spark plug

695
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,758
which, when the piston
had forced the enemy

696
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,887
into a state of high
compression, would explode

697
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,389
the combustible mass.

698
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,016
That was the final strategy.

699
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,187
To succeed, perfect
coordination would be necessary

700
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,815
between land, sea, and air forces.

701
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,819
The Northwest African Air Force

702
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,696
commanded by General Spaatz

703
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,739
was divided into five major groups

704
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,783
of which three were combat.

705
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,535
The Strategic Air Force

706
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,120
under General Jimmy Doolittle.

707
00:49:58,121 --> 00:50:01,124
These were the big boys,
the long-range bombers,

708
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,626
pounding away at enemy bases and shipping.

709
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,924
The Coastal Air Force
under Air Marshal Lloyd.

710
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:14,637
Day and night fighters, these,
protecting ports and convoys.

711
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:16,890
And finally the Tactical Air Force,

712
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,850
a new conception of air power.

713
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,227
Developed by the British
in the Middle East.

714
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,104
All fighters and attack bombers,

715
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:26,399
British and American, were
placed under one command

716
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,526
so that we could strike
with the full force

717
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,237
of our flying artillery when and where

718
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:32,655
it would do the most good.

719
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,118
Air Marshal Cunningham,
in command of this group,

720
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:41,414
and General Alexander, in
command of all ground forces,

721
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:44,292
lived and worked side
by side in a tent camp

722
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:45,668
in the Tunisian mountains.

723
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,881
Theirs was a complete partnership

724
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,300
and in it lay the pattern
of ultimate victory.

725
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,179
By the middle of March, the stage was set.

726
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,182
The first move was up to
Air Marshal Cunningham.

727
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:05,772
In a continuous 24-hour assault,

728
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,483
the Mareth fortifications
were pounded from the air.

729
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,090
Then General Alexander gave
the signal for the piston

730
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,758
to begin its upward stroke.

731
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:36,803
Montgomery, looking ahead,

732
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,764
had planned the Mareth
battle three months before.

733
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,270
He would strike after a
barrage and in moonlight

734
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,646
as at El Alamein.

735
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,191
But simultaneously he
would begin an outflanking

736
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,359
movement on the left.

737
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,990
The frontal blow had to cross
a gorge, the Wadi Zig-Zaou.

738
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:00,368
And create a bridgehead
under cover of which

739
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:02,787
tanks and artillery could cross the Wadi

740
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:05,748
before the enemy's counterattack
in force could be made.

741
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:12,463
Three days before the
attack it rained heavily.

742
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,497
Next morning, our men were
holding on like bulldogs.

743
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,624
Only four tanks had got across.

744
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,709
But with these and their own arms,

745
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,920
our infantry kept the bridgehead intact.

746
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:38,257
The enemy, fearing another El Alamein,

747
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:42,553
now withdrew armor from other
sectors and threw it in.

748
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:01,572
Whilst this battle raged,

749
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:04,325
our outflanking left
hook by General Freyburg

750
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:06,035
and his New Zealanders, reinforced by

751
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:08,287
the First Armored
Division, was racing across

752
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:11,207
150 miles of desert towards El Hamma.

753
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:14,752
The blow was now struck by
50,000 men on the ground

754
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,755
and by bombers, fighters, and
tank busters from the air.

755
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:56,252
The Germans, pinned down by
the Northumbrians at Mareth,

756
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:58,087
moved their armor too late.

757
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,256
The New Zealanders,
thenceforth to be known

758
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:02,550
as the left hookers, drove through.

759
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,814
- The
Mareth Line had been turned.

760
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:18,733
The piston was on the move.

761
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,402
Its speed made possible by
the feats in road building

762
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:23,029
of the South African engineers.

763
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,461
Air and naval forces
shelled and bombed all along

764
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,420
the seawall.

765
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:46,135
Our fighters struck at
their transport planes,

766
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,888
still pouring men in
through the intake valve,

767
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,516
knocking them out of
the sky by the hundreds.

768
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,172
And on land, the British First Army

769
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,383
was a constant threat in the north

770
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,094
while in the center, the
French had attacked at Pichon

771
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,638
and further south the
Americans had broken through

772
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,682
to El Guettar and Maknassy.

773
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,351
Thus enforcing constant pressure all along

774
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,144
the land wall of the cylinder.

775
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,348
April 7th.

776
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:17,143
American patrols of light
tanks striking eastward

777
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:21,272
met patrols of the British
Eighth Army advancing northward.

778
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,487
- We got quite a bang
out of meeting these guys.

779
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,741
2,000 miles they'd come,
fighting all the way.

780
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:35,119
Yes sir, we got a real bang out of it.

781
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:38,706
These are the guys that broke
the back of the Afrika Korps.

782
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:49,967
- Still the piston

783
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,011
pushed relentlessly on.

784
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,347
April the 10th, Sfax.

785
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:55,598
April the 12th, Sousse.

786
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,143
And on April the 20th,
after exactly 30 days

787
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:01,938
of fighting and pursuit,
the Eighth Army had driven

788
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:05,733
the enemy into the hills
beyond Enfidaville.

789
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:09,028
And in its wake was a great homecoming.

790
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:12,865
- What got me was
watching those villagers

791
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,325
coming back.

792
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:17,203
Mostly on little donkeys
piled up with so much stuff

793
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,580
you'd wonder how they carried it.

794
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:21,499
It reminded me of the Bible somehow.

795
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,251
You know, the donkeys and the hills behind

796
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,754
and these folks, trekking home.

797
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,508
There was one old chap
spoke a bit of English

798
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,593
and he comes up to me and old Joe McAdams

799
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,887
and he says, "Thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you."

800
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:36,764
And then he started shaking hands with us.

801
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:39,266
I thought he was never gonna let go.

802
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:42,436
And as we watched him going
down the hill, Joe says to me,

803
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:44,981
he says, "You know George, I had a buddy

804
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:48,818
"killed the other day and
I was pretty sore about it.

805
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:51,529
"But now all these poor devils coming home

806
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,948
"gives the whole thing
a kind of a meaning."

807
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,618
Well then when we went down to the village

808
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,954
it was just the same down there.

809
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,373
Little Jewish boys taking
off the yellow stars

810
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,376
they'd been made to wear
as if they was lepers.

811
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,753
And then our army doctors
attending to the women

812
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,255
and the youngsters just as if they was

813
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,798
on the panel back home.

814
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,969
I certainly felt less brown north.

815
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,137
I certainly did.

816
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,682
- The rapid
advance of the Eighth Army

817
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,727
had left the American divisions
at Maknassy and El Guettar

818
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,937
far behind the battle area.

819
00:59:25,146 --> 00:59:28,274
General Alexander now switched
these divisions to the north.

820
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,401
This remarkable 200 mile march

821
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,695
across the heavy traffic
streams of the First Army's

822
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,823
lines of supply was
accomplished without once

823
00:59:36,032 --> 00:59:38,159
interrupting the eastward flow.

824
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,785
And this in complete secrecy.

825
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:55,134
The piston had completed
its upward stroke.

826
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:58,179
The desired state of
enemy high compression

827
00:59:58,387 --> 00:59:59,430
had been achieved.

828
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,766
Now to capture the spark plug,

829
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,643
the vital hills west of Tunis and Bizerte.

830
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,855
- This led
to a number of major battles

831
01:00:08,064 --> 01:00:10,441
of which five were typical.

832
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:14,945
Hill 609, Longstop Hill, Goubellat Plain,

833
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,364
Djebel Mansour, and Takrouna.

834
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,951
The Eighth Army struck at Takrouna.

835
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,622
The French 19th Corps
attacked Djebel Mansour.

836
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:41,180
On the Goubellat Plain, the
British Sixth Armored Division

837
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,891
striking towards Tunis had drawn upon it

838
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,810
most of the enemy's remaining armor.

839
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:16,924
In three days of struggle,

840
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,717
our main purpose was accomplished.

841
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,427
The drawing to this battlefield

842
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,513
of von Arnim's tanks and guns

843
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,223
and their destruction.

844
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,600
Meantime, the British
Seventy-Eighth Division

845
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:29,311
was pressing the attack on Longstop Hill.

846
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:45,846
For 12 days, the hills
echoed with gunfire.

847
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,766
Positions were taken, lost, and retaken.

848
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:51,810
When the German lines broke at last,

849
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:56,649
their dead lay in hundreds
unburied on the battlefields.

850
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:04,406
As our infantry went forward,
engineers and pioneers

851
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,742
built roads across the mountaintops

852
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:08,869
for vital supplies to reach them.

853
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:11,830
In 14 days they built 11 miles.

854
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,210
Meanwhile, further north,

855
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,379
the Americans had embarked on their phase

856
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:19,296
of the campaign.

857
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:24,385
This started with the assault on Hill 609.

858
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,096
Long-range artillery started the attack.

859
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:37,207
- Directions all batteries.

860
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:38,625
Left Eighth.

861
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:39,918
Baker.
- Baker.

862
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,019
- We took Hill 609.

863
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,941
There weren't as many of us guys

864
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,652
when we got to the top as
there'd been at the bottom.

865
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:48,487
We took it.

866
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:54,660
- Thus one
by one von Arnim's strongholds

867
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:55,953
in the mountains fell.

868
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,622
The Germans had been outfought;

869
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:00,916
now they were to be outwitted.

870
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,961
General Alexander knew their
fear of the Eighth Army

871
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:06,880
so he reinforced that fear
with heavy bombardments

872
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:09,883
and local attacks from Montgomery's front.

873
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,344
At the same time, he secretly transferred

874
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:13,387
the Fourth Indian

875
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,639
and the First and
Seventh Armored Divisions

876
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:18,475
from the Eighth to the
First Army in the north

877
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,394
whence the main attack was to come.

878
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,899
The spark plug was ours,

879
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:29,278
and we were now ready to
explode the combustible mass.

880
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,406
Now to pour on the power.

881
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,617
Now to give the apostles of power

882
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,953
an education in the use of it.

883
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:03,187
British and Americans in the air

884
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:04,897
with everything that could fly.

885
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,449
The British and Americans on the ground

886
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,743
with everything that could shoot.

887
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:27,544
French artillery.

888
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:28,795
French infantry.

889
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:37,262
The British navy.

890
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:45,103
All poured forth their concentrated fury.

891
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:01,870
This was blitz warfare such
as the inventors of the blitz

892
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,330
had never dreamed of.

893
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,432
The Nazis' challenge to the free world

894
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:25,018
to fight or surrender was being answered.

895
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,080
After only eight hours fighting,

896
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:11,708
the hard crust of German
resistance shattered.

897
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,504
Our armor crashed through.

898
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:33,772
The Americans blitzed
their way into Bizerte.

899
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,273
The British smashed
right through the center

900
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:37,109
to capture Tunis.

901
01:10:37,317 --> 01:10:39,277
Then a British armored
column crashed across

902
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:41,446
the neck of Cape Blanc to Hammamet.

903
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:44,074
Another British column raced
around the tip of the cape

904
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,034
to prevent any evacuation.

905
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:50,080
The whole Axis mass was
split into four segments.

906
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,665
The end came quickly.

907
01:10:56,128 --> 01:10:59,589
- By tens, by hundreds,

908
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:03,218
by thousands they came.

909
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,554
On foot.

910
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,931
In trucks.

911
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,558
And behind their bands.

912
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:17,899
The greatest mass surrender
of fully-equipped troops

913
01:11:18,108 --> 01:11:19,109
in modern history.

914
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,364
We had lost nearly 70,000 men,

915
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:26,366
dead, wounded, and missing.

916
01:11:26,575 --> 01:11:31,413
35,000 British, 18,000
Americans, 15,000 French.

917
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,707
But for every man we had lost,

918
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,751
the enemy lost five.

919
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,879
And at the end, 15 full divisions,

920
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:43,800
266,000 of their best
men, laid down their arms.

921
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:49,139
- No
Bataan this, no Crete,

922
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,684
no men riddled with disease
and shrunken with hunger,

923
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:54,770
fighting to the last, bare-handed.

924
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:58,231
Educated in the school for power,

925
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,485
they were quick to
recognize superior power,

926
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,946
and when they did, they quit, quit cold.

927
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:09,409
This is the end of the
Axis African adventure.

928
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:23,757
- After all
the racket, seems funny,

929
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:24,716
don't it Joe?

930
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:27,427
So quiet.
- Yeah.

931
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,388
- What's biting you, Joe?

932
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:31,306
- I dunno.

933
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,309
I can't helping thinking all the hard work

934
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:36,394
that went into those burnt-out tanks

935
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:40,357
and half-tracks and
aeroplanes, gone for nothing.

936
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:41,441
- Had to be done.

937
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:42,692
- Oh sure it did.

938
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:44,945
But still and all,

939
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:47,280
think of all the trucks
and automobiles and things

940
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:49,533
all that junk mighta been.

941
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:50,492
- I know.

942
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:52,452
Bloody shame.

943
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:55,247
- Just because he was told

944
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:56,790
that he was a superman.

945
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,459
- Well he never
figured things out for hisself.

946
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:01,878
Never argued the toss same as we do.

947
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,964
Too bad he didn't hear
some of our arguments

948
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:06,424
at the old Dog and Fox back home.

949
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,134
- You know I guess
that's the real difference

950
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:09,636
between us and them.

951
01:13:09,845 --> 01:13:12,222
We argue the toss, as
you say, and they don't.

952
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,640
- Yeah, and when you don't argue

953
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:16,268
the toss anymore you
aren't half a man anymore.

954
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:17,102
- Right.
- You're just

955
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,772
a blooming tool, like a
spanner or a saw or a gimlet.

956
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:22,274
- Maybe they like it that way.

957
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,442
- Maybe they
do, but s'pose somebody

958
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,903
tried to use you or me like that, Joe.

959
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:29,197
S'pose somebody said, "Put
that fellow's eyes out,"

960
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:32,284
or "Turn a hosepipe on
that Jew or on that woman".

961
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:35,161
Would we do it?
- What do you think?

962
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:38,748
- You and me Joe, we
may not always think alike,

963
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:40,667
but we do think.

964
01:13:40,876 --> 01:13:44,588
You and me and old Alphonse and the rest,

965
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,673
we certainly think alright.

966
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:50,176
- You know George, I got an idea.

967
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:52,304
Why can't we, after the war,

968
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:54,097
the same work gang I mean,

969
01:13:54,306 --> 01:13:56,308
keep on swinging together?

970
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,559
What couldn't we do?

971
01:13:57,767 --> 01:14:00,020
- You mean build
more houses than ever was?

972
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:00,896
- Yeah, that's it.

973
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,856
- And ships, thousands of ships.

974
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:03,690
- Right.

975
01:14:03,899 --> 01:14:06,192
- And food so's
nobody be hungry no more.

976
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:07,527
- Yeah, building things up

977
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:09,446
instead of blowing things up.

978
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,574
Like, I don't know,
like dams in the desert

979
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:14,409
and roads through the jungles,

980
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,786
maybe bridges across all the oceans.

981
01:14:16,995 --> 01:14:18,079
We could do it, I bet you!

982
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,581
- Yeah, do all the jobs

983
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,625
that wants doing, and knock the block off

984
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:24,044
anybody who wants to start another war.

985
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:27,088
And bring the smiles
back to the kids' faces

986
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,090
all over the world.

987
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:30,300
- Boy what a job.

988
01:14:31,259 --> 01:14:34,429
- But just now Joe
it's the same rough road.

989
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:36,932
The same road you and me have just come.

990
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:39,935
The same bloody hard road,

991
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,687
and for quite a while yet.

992
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:45,315
- Boy oh boy, what a job.

993
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,234
Bringing back the smiles to kids' faces.

994
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:59,371
Vive la France!

995
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:33,405
- Africa is free.

996
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,408
- And Europe,
that much nearer freedom.

997
01:15:38,076 --> 01:15:41,037
Liberating hosts are on the wing.
