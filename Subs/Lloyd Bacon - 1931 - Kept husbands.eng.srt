1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:27,134
I've never seen anything like it.
Talk about your heroism.

4
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:30,762
He went down in that blazing pit not once,
mind you, but three times

5
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,598
and carried them all out,
one after another.

6
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:33,640
Not really.

7
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:35,642
Why, he doesn't know what fear is.

8
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,853
Probably too dumb to know what it is.

9
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,356
Well, where there's no sense,
there's no feeling.

10
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:44,026
There's nothing dumb about him.
I wish I had more men like him.

11
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,944
I hope you rewarded him, Arthur?

12
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,237
Say, you wouldn't believe this.

13
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:50,949
I presented him with a check for
$1,000 and he wouldn't take it.

14
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:54,202
What? Must be interesting
to meet a man like that.

15
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,413
[laughs] You're going to.
I've asked him over.

16
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,831
-[woman] Here?
- Yes, tonight.

17
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,124
For heaven's sake.

18
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,418
But we're going to the opera
right after dinner.

19
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:03,920
That's all right.
He's only coming for dinner.

20
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:07,883
- A workman, for dinner?
- Yes, why not?

21
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,926
Arthur, what ghastly joke is this?

22
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:13,347
- But, Henrietta, he's a hero.
- In overalls.

23
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,057
Well, what will our guests say?

24
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:17,267
Call him up at once and tell him
he's not to come over.

25
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:20,604
He isn't a common workman,
he's a steel boss.

26
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:24,316
You see, Mother? It's perfectly all right.
He's a steel boss.

27
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,734
His name is Dick Brunton.

28
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,569
I don't care what his name is.

29
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:30,364
Brunton? Brunton?
That name sounds familiar.

30
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,991
He's a fine chap.
I've had my eye on him for a long while.

31
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:36,995
Don't talk to me. Overalls... [scoffs]

32
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:41,500
Well... it'll be a thrill
having a working man for dinner.

33
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:47,172
Yeah? Well, you've had one
for a good many years: me.

34
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,299
That's all I was when I started.

35
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,760
But this invitation,
it's downright cruelty.

36
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,596
Dinner with all our flunkies around
might prove very embarrassing

37
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:57,182
to slim-jim the rail bender.

38
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,351
Gosh, I never thought of that.

39
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:03,355
Or it would be lots of fun watching him
scoop mashed potatoes on his knife.

40
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:05,440
Oh, now, it won't be as bad as that.

41
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:08,276
I know those strong, silent men.

42
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:11,863
Well, I'll put the radio on
while he's inhaling his soup.

43
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,127
Longview-5855.

44
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,712
Now what are you going to do?

45
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,964
Break the big news to Charlie Bates.

46
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:31,007
Well, I guess I'll go up
and change for dinner.

47
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,342
Yes, by all means.

48
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:35,262
And Finley's laid out
a nice, new pair of overalls for you.

49
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,179
[both laugh]

50
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:39,850
Oh, hello, Charlie. Listen, you're gonna
have the laugh of your life tonight.

51
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:42,978
Father's invited a big he-man
from the mill for dinner.

52
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:46,398
All right, Dot,
I'll come over and bring my dinner pail.

53
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,859
Now, don't fail to get over here on time,
will you, Charlie?

54
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:50,610
You bet, Dot.
As soon as the whistle blows,

55
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,904
I'll throw down my tools
and rush right over.

56
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,322
[laughs]

57
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,949
All right, Charlie. Good-bye.

58
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,202
[man] What's the opera tonight?

59
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,288
[man 2] Well, I think
they're singing <i>Il Trovatore.</i>

60
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,707
[man]
<i>II Trovatore?</i> Good. I'm glad I ducked it.

61
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:07,502
I hear enough Anvil Choruses
out at the foundry.

62
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,467
[woman] Dot, I know you'll enjoy
the opera tonight.

63
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,844
-[man 2] Why, she's not going.
-[man] Pass the olives.

64
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,309
Dorothea, would you mind
passing the olives?

65
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,481
- Do the doctors think they can cure it?
- Cure what?

66
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:31,610
Your hearing. I've asked you 18 times
to pass the olives.

67
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,320
Pardon me.

68
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,325
I said, "the olives."

69
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:41,620
Excuse me.

70
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,468
Say, Dot, get a load of that.

71
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,386
Dick Merrill looking for a toothpick.

72
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,269
What an odd charm. May I see it, please?

73
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:10,482
- Oh, it's nothing, really.
- Oh, please!

74
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,735
-[charm jingles]
- Thank you.

75
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:21,660
- Ladies and gentlemen...
-[all chuckle]

76
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,287
A grievous social error
has been made here tonight.

77
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,497
Dorothea.

78
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:27,916
A guest has been brought here
under false pretenses.

79
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:28,834
Dot!

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,336
[Dot] Let me introduce to
you the real Dick Brunton.

81
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:34,381
All-American halfback,
the man who beat Yale.

82
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:37,634
Why, Brunton. Say, I had no idea.

83
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:42,097
Halfback?
I thought you said he was a steel boss.

84
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:46,601
Boy, I'll never forget
that forward pass as long as I live.

85
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,687
Well, I'll be a something or other.

86
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:52,065
You certainly will.
Well, I'm glad that's out.

87
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,067
You've had me guessing all night.

88
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:56,194
[Henrietta]
Serve coffee in the drawing room.

89
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,572
Brunton, this is a surprise.

90
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,122
One or two lumps, Mrs. Parker?

91
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:08,331
One, please.

92
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,794
Well, Brunton, have you changed your mind
about that check?

93
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,754
No, sir. Thanks just the same.

94
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,298
You talk it over with your mother?

95
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,883
Yes, sir. And she agrees with me.

96
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,135
You see, Mr. Parker,
I didn't do that for money.

97
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,137
I did it because-- Well, anybody'd do it.

98
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:24,389
- You understand, don't you?
- Yes, I think I do.

99
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:27,267
A thousand dollars is a lot of money,
Mr. Brunton.

100
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:30,020
-[Brunton] Yes, but--
- Oh, don't be silly. Go ahead and take it.

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,522
Why? Do you want me to?

102
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:35,775
- Would you if I wanted you to?
-[Brunton] No.

103
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,486
Uh-uh. Fourth down, nine yards to go.

104
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:39,779
[all laugh]

105
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,699
Well, at the very least,
I'll see that you get the Carnegie Medal.

106
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,868
Oh, no. Please
don't do anything like that.

107
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,830
- How does it feel to be a hero?
-[scoffs] You'll never know.

108
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:50,665
Dorothea.

109
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:54,336
Now, please leave Mr. Brunton alone.
I want to talk to him.

110
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:55,712
[laughs]

111
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,342
Why didn't you tell us you were Dick
Brunton, the All-American halfback?

112
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:03,511
Why should I? Right now I'm simply
your father's steel boss.

113
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:05,931
Well, I can't understand
why you kept it dark.

114
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:08,767
The All-American, I mean.
Makes things easier for you.

115
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,936
I know. But easy things aren't much good.

116
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:14,272
But aside from that,
it would get you in with the right crowd.

117
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,233
You can't run around
with the right crowd on 45 a week.

118
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:20,737
Mr. and Mrs. Post.

119
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,698
- Good evening, everybody.
- Hello.

120
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,200
- Hello there.
- Hello.

121
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,242
Hello, Henrietta.

122
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:27,994
How are you?

123
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,664
Say,
"Good evening, everybody," Pansy, darling.

124
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,666
Are you ready to go, Henrietta?

125
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:35,085
- Yes, dear. Good evening, Llewllyn.
- How do you do?

126
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:37,379
Will you all go upstairs
while we get our wraps?

127
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:38,546
Yes, surely.

128
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,757
Say, Llewllyn, will you have a--

129
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,259
Hold up. You'd better
go and sit in the car.

130
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:45,595
- Yes, dear.
- And bundle Pansy up good.

131
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:48,974
Because I don't want
my little bitsy baby to catch cold.

132
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:50,725
Yes, dear.

133
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,228
[giggles]

134
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,278
"Yes, dear. Yes, dear. Yes, dear."

135
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:05,281
What a spectacle.
Why, he's no more than a kept husband.

136
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:06,199
It's a tragedy.

137
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:09,035
Llewllyn Post should've been
the greatest architect in America.

138
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,246
But he married Lucille.
She wouldn't let him work.

139
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:14,666
She killed all his ambition.
It's her fault, not his.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,377
You don't have to go yet.
Dad and I aren't going out.

141
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:19,963
I know. But it's late for me.
I have to get home and go to bed.

142
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,715
You see, I have to be
at the plant at 6:00.

143
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:25,093
6:00, eh? I never go to bed until 6:00.

144
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,220
I'll have Hopkins
take you home in the car.

145
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,889
[laughing, chattering]

146
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:31,766
- Well, all set?
- Yep.

147
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:33,059
Good night, Mr. Brunton.

148
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:35,353
Good night, Mrs. Parker.
I've had a wonderful time.

149
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,814
- Have a good time.
- We will.

150
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,444
You've been mighty kind, Miss Parker.

151
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,612
I'll remember this evening
for a long time.

152
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:45,905
So will I.

153
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:49,159
I hope you'll forgive me
for exposing your, uh, past.

154
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:50,952
[chuckles] That's all right.

155
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:54,581
I wish you'd think it over. You know,
about getting in with the right crowd?

156
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:56,166
Honestly, I can't afford to.

157
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:57,751
Oh, that wouldn't make any difference.

158
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,211
Anyhow, I spend my spare time studying.

159
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:01,713
See, I wanna get somewhere.

160
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,007
There's more to life
than just gold footballs.

161
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:07,927
Really? And there's more to life than
grinding away at books every night.

162
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:10,221
Oh, I don't like to. I'm human.

163
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,308
You don't mean it? [laughs]
I wouldn't have suspected that.

164
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:15,351
I enjoy a good time as much as anyone.

165
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:17,604
But I'm working now
so I can have fun when I get older.

166
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:20,356
- And can't enjoy it.
- Well, maybe you're right.

167
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:23,151
- Well, Brunton, if you're ready, we'll...
- Yes, sir.

168
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,487
- Good night, Miss Parker, and thank you.
- Good night.

169
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:29,741
- Thank you, too. You've been very kind.
- Not at all.

170
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:37,332
- Well, good night, Mr. Parker.
- Good night, my boy.

171
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:51,054
- Well?
- Well?

172
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:53,431
Did you notice how
he balanced those peas on his knife?

173
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:56,226
Oh, don't rub it in.
How about your thousand-dollar check?

174
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,104
That boy has something.
He's one man in a thousand.

175
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,314
Thousand? He's one in a million.

176
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,526
And as far as your daughter's concerned,
he's the one man in the world.

177
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,445
- How you mean?
- I mean, I'm going to marry him.

178
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,572
What? Are you crazy?

179
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,990
You just bet I am.

180
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:12,951
Look here, Dot, you're not serious.

181
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:16,079
Dad, I was never more serious in my life.

182
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:17,539
The minute I saw him,

183
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:21,084
I didn't give two hoots if he
gargled his soup in the key of A minor.

184
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:23,837
All I knew was that boy was made for me.

185
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,214
And what's more, I'm gonna have him.

186
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:29,717
Now, look here, Dot,
aren't you just a little bit hasty?

187
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:32,095
I can't get him too quick to suit me.

188
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:33,888
See here, Dot.

189
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,850
Now, listen, don't you fool yourself.

190
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,476
Now I'm a pretty good judge of men.

191
00:10:38,643 --> 00:10:43,231
I tell you this boy has real character,
and he'll never propose to you.

192
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,024
Now, see here, Dad, listen.

193
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,236
There isn't a man
in this world a woman can't win,

194
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:51,072
-if she really wants to land him.
- I don't believe that.

195
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:54,159
All right. All I ask is four weeks.

196
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,578
- Four weeks.
- Four weeks.

197
00:10:58,746 --> 00:11:02,125
When do you think
your wayward son will stagger in?

198
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,418
Can't tell ya.

199
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:05,461
Well, it's gettin' late.

200
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,422
Oh, rich folks, like the Parkers,

201
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,007
have supper till all hours.

202
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:13,928
Yeah. What's caviar to the few
is applesauce to the gander.

203
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,639
You should've told him
to take that thousand bucks.

204
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,392
Oh, no, Hughie, why should I?

205
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:23,438
Why, I wouldn't want Dick
to take anything he didn't earn.

206
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,482
A penny saved is a dollar earned.

207
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:31,070
If you had all that sugar,
maybe you could ease up on my board bill.

208
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:34,240
[chuckles]
I'm in no hurry for the money, Hughie.

209
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:37,785
Well, that's just as well
'cause I ain't got any.

210
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,052
Say, would you mind honking
the horn a couple of times?

211
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:55,136
Sure.

212
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,679
[honks horn]

213
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:58,973
[horn honking]

214
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:16,991
Well, Mother, I told you we'd be riding
around in a Rolls-Royce one day.

215
00:12:17,158 --> 00:12:19,786
- Did you have a nice time, dear?
- I certainly did.

216
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:20,870
Good.

217
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:26,709
Hey, high-pockets,
did you bring home the bacon?

218
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:29,087
No. I told him he could keep his check.

219
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,422
I figured that all in.

220
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,509
- Did you give Mrs. Parker my love?
- Sure.

221
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:36,010
What'd she say?

222
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:37,720
"I'll take vanilla."

223
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,600
Well, now that that's all settled,
maybe you better hit the hay.

224
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:47,647
I claim "Early to rise and early to bed,
then you live all your life...

225
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:50,233
until you're dead."

226
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,153
Tell me, Dick,
what kind of people are they?

227
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,281
Oh, you'd get a great kick
out of them, Mother.

228
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,824
The father's a pretty good scout.

229
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:00,285
Don't do that, Mother.
You're going to ruin your teeth.

230
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:03,454
They were ruined long ago.
How about Mrs. Parker?

231
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:06,124
Oh. She's got one of those
trick English accents.

232
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,334
Only trouble is
it slips out of gear all the time,

233
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,546
and she gets all balled up
between her "vah-ses" and her "vases."

234
00:13:11,713 --> 00:13:13,881
Well, that's no crime. Is she nice?

235
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,967
She almost froze me when I first came in.

236
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:18,761
Looked at me as though she expected
I'd be wearing overalls.

237
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:22,181
Oh, you only imagined that.
How about the daughter?

238
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,892
Not for mine. Just plain spoiled.

239
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,021
Oh, well, now, maybe that isn't her fault.

240
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:30,606
Too much money isn't good for anybody.

241
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,569
Still, some of them make very good wives.

242
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,612
Well, I can never imagine her as a wife.

243
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:37,739
[laughs]

244
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,700
Imagine Dot Parker bending over a washtub.

245
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:43,411
Well, maybe she wouldn't be afraid
to bend over one if she had to.

246
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:44,579
Oh, don't be silly.

247
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:48,041
Say, she's about as useful as...
as a little silky kitten.

248
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,169
It's what they should've called her.
"Kitten."

249
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:53,963
Kitten.

250
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:58,009
Oh... [chuckles]

251
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,764
[metal clanging]

252
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:21,074
- Hello, Mr. Barbour.
- Hello, Dick. Look over these.

253
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,492
What are they?

254
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:24,118
The Mississippi bridge plans.

255
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:26,579
Something that will
revolutionize the industry.

256
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,748
That is, uh, if he can sell the idea.

257
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,249
You don't seem very confident.

258
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,252
I know it's the greatest
engineering achievement in years.

259
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,922
Parker's willing to bet his roll on it.

260
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,801
But it'll take a real salesman
to make others see it as we do.

261
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,469
- Well, let's get started.
- All right.

262
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:43,930
Can, uh, you get them finished
by one o'clock?

263
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,599
- Yes, sir.
- Fine. We're awfully busy.

264
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,184
I know I can depend on you.

265
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,904
[horn honking]

266
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:03,408
[honking continues]

267
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:18,131
Hey. How long you been working here?

268
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,016
Well, there she is again.

269
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:32,019
Couldn't be more regular
if she punched the clock.

270
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,855
Ain't that old man Parker's daughter?

271
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,149
- Sure.
- What's she here for?

272
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:39,444
Well, if you don't know,
you're the only one that don't.

273
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,279
She's here to grab Dick Brunton.

274
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:45,032
Pretty soft for Brunton.

276
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,410
That girl's independently rich.

277
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:51,747
She's got nothin' on him.
He's independently poor.

278
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:56,210
Gee. I wish some doll
with all her dough was nuts about me.

279
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,051
[knocking]

280
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,720
Sorry. I'm busy.

281
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,059
[metal clangs]

282
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,651
Why, Dick, too busy for me?

283
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,946
- Oh, Dot, how are ya?
- Fine. How are you?

284
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,616
Well, I'm kinda tied up.
Mr. Barbour gave me a rush job.

285
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:28,618
- Oh, that can wait.
- No, it's very important.

286
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:30,661
But I've got something
even more important.

287
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:32,038
Honestly, Dot, I can't.

288
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:35,416
[work horn blows]

289
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,252
- It's your lunch hour, isn't it?
- Well, I promised Mr. Barbour.

290
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:40,505
- He can spare you for an hour.
- No.

291
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:42,340
- Hello, Mr. Barbour.
- Hello, Miss Parker.

292
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,509
Do you mind if I take Dick away
for an hour?

293
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,552
Why, no, uh, not at all.

294
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,847
- Those plans can wait, can't they?
- Yes, certainly.

295
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:50,932
But, Mr. Barbour--

296
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,267
That's all right, my boy.
That's all right.

297
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,810
Thank you, Mr. Barbour.

298
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:22,088
[whistle blaring]

299
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:32,515
- There we go.
-[Dot] Oh.

300
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,227
- Oh, no.
- Oh, but this is my treat.

301
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:39,647
You can't sign here. You're not a member.

302
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,485
- That's yours, Paul.
- Thank you.

303
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,163
They always work.

304
00:17:57,373 --> 00:18:00,876
Gee, that's a keen trick.
You gotta show me how to do that.

305
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:08,217
Dick... know what day it is today?

306
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,762
Yeah. Wednesday, December 20th.

307
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:15,600
It was exactly
four weeks ago today I met you.

308
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,643
That's right, four weeks.

309
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:20,855
What are you smiling at?

310
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,356
Just thought of something.

311
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,984
Just think, four weeks.

312
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,819
And it seems as if I've known you ages.

313
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,821
That's just the way it seems to me too.

314
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:32,867
But I have known you a long time. I've
seen many games you've played.

315
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:36,078
Why, when you beat Yale,
I even cut your picture out of the paper

316
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,580
and put it over my dresser.

317
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,624
[chuckles] Oh, you're kidding?

318
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:41,083
Am I?

319
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:44,503
There.

320
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:45,838
Well...

321
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,717
Gee, that was--
That was published about five years ago.

322
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:51,969
I guess you believe me now.

323
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:56,557
December 20th...
five more days till Christmas.

324
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,018
I better get busy.

325
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:01,896
I suppose you did
your Christmas shopping early?

326
00:19:02,563 --> 00:19:04,482
I've only got one more thing to get.

327
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,318
Been expecting to get it for four weeks.

328
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,779
You better not put it off any longer.

329
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,364
That depends on you.

330
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,574
- On me?
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:16,118
Well, if there's anything I can do...

332
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:20,581
What is it?

333
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,504
- A proposal.
- A what?

334
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,838
May I have it?

335
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:31,258
- You mean, you want me--
- I want you.

336
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,637
[chuckles] You're only kidding.

337
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,724
All right. Just propose to me
and see whether I am or not.

338
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:41,727
- But, Dot, I can't do anything like that.
- You mean...?

339
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,104
I'm nothing but a...

340
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:47,066
You mean you won't propose to me?

341
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,653
I would if I could, but...

342
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,406
Very well. I'll propose to you, Dick.

343
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:54,615
Will you marry me?

344
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,702
No, Dot, I can't.

345
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,954
I haven't anything to offer
a girl like you.

346
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:01,664
You're all I want.

347
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,833
I know what you're thinking.

348
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,876
But don't let that stand in your way.

349
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,295
Don't you love me enough to forget it?

350
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:11,674
Oh, I wish I could forget.

351
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:15,970
Oh, if you really love me, you'll try.

352
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:17,847
Won't you please try?

353
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:20,015
Come on, Dick, say yes.

354
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,937
No.

355
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,287
Dick, do you mean that?

356
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:42,288
Yes.

357
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:43,414
Oh!

358
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:46,917
Oh, gee, I'm so happy.

359
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,839
- Put that on.
- No, I can't do that.

360
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:54,467
Oh, but, look,
someday you'll afford to buy me one.

361
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:56,343
Go on, Dicky.

362
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:58,554
Please.

363
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:19,533
Mrs. Barham: Crystal champagne sets.

364
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,619
Miss Prague, you're impossible.

365
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:23,412
Send her a Christmas card.

366
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:26,123
And her husband is a victim
of the stock market.

367
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,000
Spare me your sarcasm, Arthur.

368
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,419
- That completes the list, doesn't it?
-[Prague] Yes, ma'am.

369
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,671
Mother, you've forgotten
all about Aunt Julia.

370
00:21:33,214 --> 00:21:35,466
Thanks for reminding me, Dorothea.

371
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,719
Now, let's see,
what is useful in a boardinghouse?

372
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:40,137
A long reach.

373
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:43,140
Money's useful in a boardinghouse, Mother.

374
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:46,352
If I send Julia money,
she'll only spend it.

375
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,105
Send Aunt Julia a nice, warm shawl,
Miss Prague.

376
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,860
-[Prague] That will be all?
-[Henrietta] Yes, Prague.

377
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,661
[Henrietta] Christmas gets
more appalling every year.

378
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:07,998
Prague's so stupid.
I'm sure she's omitted someone.

379
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:09,500
She has.

380
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,341
Oh!

381
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:21,554
Now, what do you want for Christmas?

382
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:25,015
- Oh, I selected my Christmas present.
- Oh, you have, have you?

383
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:26,976
Well, what is it?

384
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,477
Not what. Who?

385
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:32,147
Stop your foolishness, Dorothea.
What do you want for Christmas?

386
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:33,482
A husband.

387
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:36,318
[laughs] I'm afraid
I have no sense of humor.

388
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,404
Wait a minute.
So it's happened, has it?

389
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:40,823
- Mm-hmm.
- Give a woman four weeks...

390
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,910
- What are you talking about?
- Mother, I'm going to marry Dick Brunton.

391
00:22:45,077 --> 00:22:47,913
Dick Brunton, the working man?

392
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,499
Yes. But he's a steel boss.

393
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,251
[gasping]

394
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:57,840
A-Arthur, are you going to do nothing
when your daughter's gone crazy?

395
00:22:58,007 --> 00:23:02,261
Oh! It's all your fault,
inviting him here to dinner!

396
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:05,055
[sobbing]

397
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:10,603
Dot, I can hardly believe it.

398
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:12,730
I never thought he'd propose to you.

399
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:14,982
He didn't. I proposed to him.

400
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,985
Well, I'll be...

401
00:23:20,362 --> 00:23:23,699
Ah, Dad, it's all right
with you, isn't it? Can't I have him?

402
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:26,243
But just think, Dot,
he couldn't keep you in shoes.

403
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,538
You're accustomed to all this.
You'll never be able to give it up.

404
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,540
- Well, I don't intend to.
- You'll have to.

405
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:33,125
He only earns $45 a week.

406
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:35,252
- But you're going to raise his salary?
- Wha--

407
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,756
Dad, I want him
more than anything in the world.

408
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:40,466
Won't you please let me have him?

409
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:43,302
Now, you know that I'd do
anything to make you happy.

410
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,387
Gee, you're a peach, Dad. He's a good man.

411
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,889
And you'll promote him, won't you?

412
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:48,724
I'll have to if you're going to marry him.

413
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:52,603
And don't forget, I can't get along on
a cent less than 50,000 a year.

414
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,854
- Fifty-thousand?
- Mm-hmm.

415
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,981
Why, I couldn't possibly pay him that.

416
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,983
It would disrupt my whole organization.

417
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,694
- Oh, Dad...
- Now, don't worry.

418
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:02,863
I'll give him a little raise in salary.

419
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:06,617
And I'll make up the difference
out of my own pocket.

420
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:07,910
Ah, thanks, Dad.

421
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:10,079
But look here, Dot. Now, you be careful.

422
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:13,999
A man has to be made of strong stuff
not to let money spoil him.

423
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,793
Don't let it spoil Dick.

424
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,005
Money spoil Dick? Oh, don't be silly.
It could never spoil Dick.

425
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,257
- Well, I have to be going.
- Now, where are you going?

426
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:24,718
I promised Dick I'd go right over
and tell him what you said.

427
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:26,595
Bye. I'm in an awful hurry.

428
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,097
[chuckling]

429
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,486
Ah, that you, Hughie?

430
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:45,489
- I guess so.
- Didn't Dick come home with you?

431
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:49,159
Eh... two's company, three's a crowd.

432
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:52,663
- What are you talking about?
- Won't be long now.

433
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,874
Coming events cast their shadows behind.

434
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,793
Oh, go on up and get ready for dinner.

435
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,755
I guess if you knew what I know,
you'd believe in Santy Claus.

436
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:23,986
Mother, I've got a surprise for you.

437
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,487
A surprise?

438
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:26,697
What is it?

439
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:27,906
I'm gonna be married.

440
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:36,498
Dick... oh, that's wonderful.

441
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,712
- Who is she?
- You just wait.

442
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,797
She'll be here in a minute,
and you'll see her.

443
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:46,467
I-- I just knew something like this
was going to happen.

444
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,719
Oh, I know you're gonna love her, Mother.

445
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:50,679
Oh, I'll fix up the spare bedroom.

446
00:25:50,846 --> 00:25:52,097
- Spare bedroom?
- Yes.

447
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:54,933
You can have it
until you move into a home of your own.

448
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,186
Oh, Dick, this is lovely.

449
00:25:57,352 --> 00:26:00,189
Imagine getting a daughter
for a Christmas present.

450
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:02,608
[doorbell rings]

451
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:05,110
- I wonder who that is.
- Must be Santa Claus.

452
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,624
A Christmas present for you, Mother.

453
00:26:19,124 --> 00:26:21,668
Mother, this is Dorothea. Dorothea Parker.

454
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:31,970
- You dear, dear child.
- Isn't she sweet?

455
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:33,639
[both] She certainly is!

456
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:35,641
[all laughing]

457
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:39,061
I don't know what I've done to deserve
the two best women in the world.

458
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,271
Who told him he deserves us?

459
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:48,821
Oh! Let me go. You hug like a bear.

460
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:53,700
Will you excuse me a moment? Please?

461
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:58,747
Oh, Dick, I'm terribly happy.
Everything's all right.

462
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:01,041
And you don't know how glad I am, Kitten.

463
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,126
Kitten?

464
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:03,961
Yeah, that's my pet name for you.

465
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,212
Well, isn't that funny?

466
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:07,381
Dad used to call me that when I was a kid.

467
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:08,966
[laughs] Let's sit down.

468
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,053
Wanna take your coat off?

469
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,888
Oh, no, Dick.
I think we'd better be going.

470
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:16,014
All right.

471
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:24,565
Dear, I want you to have this.

472
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,861
I wore it when I was young
and my mother before me.

473
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:31,864
It's supposed to bring
good fortune to the bride.

474
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,243
Why what a lovely old ring.
I'll wear it all the time.

475
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,913
Mrs. Brunton, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.

476
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,666
I hope it brings you
all the happiness in the world.

477
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,711
I don't want to rush, Mother,
but we've got a million things to do.

478
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:47,337
Oh, that's all right. I understand.

479
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:53,719
Listen, dear, Dick's a wonderful boy.

480
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:56,555
But all men are peculiar.

481
00:27:57,014 --> 00:28:00,350
You just handle him right,
and you'll be very happy.

482
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:02,144
Oh, I understand.

483
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,066
I'll be home early, Mother.

484
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,693
Good night, Mrs. Brunton.

485
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:12,237
Good night.

486
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,455
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

487
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:23,540
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Good-bye.

488
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:38,805
Isn't that a beautiful car?

489
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,893
I don't give it much.
It's last year's model.

490
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,504
Well, Hughie, what do you think?

491
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:14,967
I think he's a sap
if he marries a dame like her.

492
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,344
You'd never catch me doing that.

493
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,305
Doggone if I'd slave
for a million bucks a week,

494
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:23,642
just to have some canary
spend it on brassieres.

495
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:26,520
She's a nice girl.

496
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:30,107
What's one man's meat
is another guy's poison.

497
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:33,151
I've heard of marriages made in heaven,

498
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,821
but not in the Parker steel plant.

499
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:39,866
Well, they're so devoted.
I think it'll work out all right.

500
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,535
Don't kid yourself.

501
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:44,746
I claim oil and water don't mix.

502
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:48,875
East is west and west is east
when Greek meets Greek.

503
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,758
[wedding march plays]

504
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:35,422
You were the loveliest bride.

505
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:38,884
When you came down that aisle,
it just took my breath away.

506
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:41,178
Will you forgive me
for kidnapping your son?

507
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:44,556
Of course. I know he's in good hands.

508
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:51,396
Dick, you have
the most wonderful girl in the world.

509
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:55,108
- See that you take good care of her.
- I will, Mother.

510
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:58,528
And don't you go
shutting yourself in your room every night

511
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,030
like you did with me.

512
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,034
You know,
Dick was always terribly ambitious.

513
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:07,287
Yes, I know.
Oh, I won't let him work too hard.

514
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:10,624
Oh, well,
I guess I better run along.

515
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,417
You're in a hurry to get down to the boat.

516
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,045
And I'll say good... good-bye.

517
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:30,352
I'm going out to the car.
Will you come along with me?

518
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,734
[sobbing]

519
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:44,491
- Come on, Mother dear.
- Good-bye, Dick.

520
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:46,118
God Bless you both.

521
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:47,661
Good-bye, Mother.

522
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,000
Say, Dick...

523
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:58,130
Well, you happy?

524
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,256
Yes, sir.

525
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:00,882
Well, I hope you're a good sailor

526
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,677
because my yacht isn't quite
as large as the <i>Leviathan.</i>

527
00:32:03,844 --> 00:32:05,053
Now, have a good time.

528
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,763
Lots of work for you when you come back.

529
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,056
Well, I'll be ready.

530
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:09,224
One thing more, Dick.

531
00:32:09,391 --> 00:32:12,102
You know, girls are peculiar and you have
to handle them very carefully.

532
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:14,688
Dorothea and I-- I think
we understand each other, Mr. Parker.

533
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:17,315
Yes, I know. But when
little things crop up,

534
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:19,693
as they will, in the best of families,

535
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,738
well, you give in a bit and the woman
will give in a whole lot. [chuckling]

536
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:24,948
I see.

537
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:29,035
Just, uh, some spending money
for your honeymoon.

538
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:36,251
What? Well, haven't you
made some mistake? I--

539
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:37,669
That's all right.

540
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:41,298
I want you both to remember your
honeymoon as long as you live.

541
00:32:41,465 --> 00:32:42,466
But I-I can't take--

542
00:32:42,632 --> 00:32:46,261
Now, you turned down my check
once for saving some lives.

543
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:49,639
I want this one to remind you
that I'm entrusting you

544
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:52,601
with the most precious life in the world.

545
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,319
Well, thank you, Mr. Parker.

546
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:23,715
[knocking]

547
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:24,841
Come in.

548
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:27,344
Hello, Dick.

549
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:30,180
Isn't it funny?
That door connects both our rooms.

550
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:33,350
Oh, please come in
so I can really believe it.

551
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,393
Still seems like a dream.

552
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,188
Oh, you're nothing but a kid.

553
00:33:38,355 --> 00:33:39,898
And you're nothing but a kitten.

554
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:44,027
It's been a strenuous day getting married
and running off to the yacht.

555
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:45,654
So I think I'll retire.

556
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,907
Good night, husband.

557
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,627
See you in the morning?

558
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,505
Good night.

559
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:32,701
Kitten?

560
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,869
- You asleep?
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:15,410
Oh... <i>C'est charmant.</i>
<i>C'est charmant, madame.</i>

562
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:17,621
You look marvelous in this.

563
00:35:17,787 --> 00:35:20,290
This, Madame Brunton,
have shown to no one else,

564
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:23,126
for no one else could wear it as you can.

565
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:25,629
Is that the kind of a woman
you think I am?

566
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:29,591
Oh, not that you are,
but that you should look on occasion.

567
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:31,885
Oh!

568
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:39,476
What's that, Prinz?

569
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:44,814
But I didn't order a coat.

570
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:47,233
But I knew you will after you saw this.

571
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,610
Oh, it's magnificent.

572
00:35:48,777 --> 00:35:51,905
It was smuggled out of Russia
a few skins at a time.

573
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,284
Don't temp me, Prinz. We're almost broke.

574
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:58,620
But when your husband sees you in this,

575
00:35:58,787 --> 00:36:00,372
ooh, ha-ha-ha!

576
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,916
He will not think of the expense.

577
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,501
Oh, ha-ha-ha!

578
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:07,337
I'll try it on, but I won't take it.

579
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:08,713
[chuckles]

580
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:12,759
Oh, it's beautiful!

581
00:36:12,926 --> 00:36:14,552
- Lovely.
- It is. It's just...

582
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,179
<i>Magnifique! Magnifique.</i>

583
00:36:16,346 --> 00:36:17,722
What's the bad news, Prinz?

584
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,265
Oh...

585
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,893
only 200,000 francs.

586
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:24,437
Good heavens, I can't afford that.

587
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:28,191
Afford?
Ten thousand dollars for a coat like this?

588
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:29,776
Madame...

589
00:36:29,943 --> 00:36:32,946
Really. You frighten me
when you say it in francs.

590
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:36,157
But put that way,
it does seem sort of, uh...

591
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:16,281
- There you are.
<i>- Merci bien, madame.</i>

592
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,658
<i>Merci beaucoup. Au revoir, madame.</i>

593
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:19,826
<i>Au revoir.</i>

594
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:23,496
<i>Au revoir, madame.</i>

595
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:24,706
<i>Au revoir.</i>

596
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:27,792
<i>Au revoir, madames.</i>

597
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,669
<i>Au revoir, monsieur.</i>

598
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:33,882
- Do you really like it?
- I think it's perfectly stunning.

599
00:37:34,048 --> 00:37:34,924
I do.

600
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:37,802
Oh, Dick, come here.
I want to show you something.

601
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:40,138
- Oh, Dick.
- Where's Llewllyn?

602
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:42,557
Why... why, he's downstairs.

603
00:37:42,724 --> 00:37:44,726
- I think he'll be up in a moment.
-[knocking]

604
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:45,810
<i>Entrer.</i>

605
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:55,111
Oh! Oh, my Pansy is dyed!

606
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:57,363
Oh! Oh, my baby!

607
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,408
What happened to my beautiful baby?

608
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:03,745
Oh, my darling baby! Oh!

609
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,872
Listen, darling,
I can explain everything--

610
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,625
I thought at least you could take
care of my dog to earn your living!

611
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:10,210
- I know, pet, but--
- Don't talk to me!

612
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:12,253
You're not fit for anything.
You're not a man!

613
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,797
You're just what everybody calls you!

614
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:15,715
[Llewllyn] Oh, now, pet,
please let me explain.

615
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:19,385
[Lucille] Get out of my sight,
you... you worm!

616
00:38:19,552 --> 00:38:20,929
All right, pet.

617
00:38:21,554 --> 00:38:23,431
Oh... [mumbling]

618
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:25,225
Aren't you a little rough
on him, Lucille?

619
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:28,102
No. What do you think
I give him his allowance for?

620
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:30,688
Look at my darling. Just look at her.

621
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:33,775
Can't the poor sap
do anything to earn his money?

622
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,903
Just look at my darling. Just look at her.

623
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,155
Oh, you don't understand
what I've been through.

624
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:41,616
Just wait until I get him alone.

625
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,203
I'm awfully sorry
this had to happen, Dick.

626
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,622
Uh, I'll see you again later.

627
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:48,957
Good night.

628
00:38:49,624 --> 00:38:54,337
Did Mother's little baby girl
get hurted by the nasty, mean old man?

629
00:38:54,504 --> 00:38:57,090
Just wait until Mother gets home...

630
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:08,726
Dick, how do you like the coat?

631
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,395
Don't try and change the subject.

632
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:12,564
Disgusting, wasn't it?
I'm through with her.

633
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,357
That's all right. You know what I mean.

634
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,150
Kept husband there.

635
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:19,028
If you apply that to yourself,
it's an insult to me.

636
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,364
Well, that's what I am until we get home.

637
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:23,074
You're making me angry!

638
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:43,303
Oh, please don't be angry with me, Dot.

639
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:46,014
Well, if you promise
not to say things like that anymore, I--

640
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,682
I've to get back to work.

641
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,352
But, look, we haven't been to Deauville,
Nice, Monte Carlo, or Biarritz.

642
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,396
That's the best part of our honeymoon.

643
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:54,647
Your old work can keep.

644
00:39:54,814 --> 00:39:56,608
How about keeping my self-respect?

645
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:59,152
Oh, why can't we stay over here longer?

646
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:02,113
Why, a few more months won't do any harm.

647
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:03,907
Well...

648
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:10,079
[whistles]

649
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:11,372
What are you [whistles] about?

650
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:14,709
Well, this coat--
200,000 francs. That's $10,000.

651
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:17,295
- Well, it's worth it.
- Where's the money coming from?

652
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:20,048
Don't be so dense.
All you have to do is cable Father.

653
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:21,758
I've cabled him three times already.

654
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,217
And he hasn't turned us down once.

655
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:25,303
I'm not gonna keep on
hitting him for more.

656
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,765
- Not if I ask you?
- Oh, please don't ask me.

657
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:31,434
You know I've got to get back to work.

658
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:34,646
- I've got to start earning a living.
- But there's no rush.

659
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:38,775
Your father's been wonderful, but
I'm not gonna impose on him any longer.

660
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,699
But we've got to go back.

661
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:47,825
[gasps]

662
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,994
Oh, Dot, what's the matter?

663
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:51,871
You know very well your old work can wait.

664
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:54,499
But it isn't right. We've got to go back.

665
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,960
First, we're going to Deauville, Nice,

666
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:59,045
Monte Carlo, and Biarritz.

667
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:02,924
No, we're not going to Deauville, Nice,
Monte Carlo, and Biarritz.

668
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,300
We're going home.

669
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:41,129
[ship's horn blows]

670
00:42:29,552 --> 00:42:31,512
Well, how do you like it?

671
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,806
- Well, it's fine, but--
- But what, sweetie?

672
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:35,850
It's all right for people
who like this sort of thing,

673
00:42:36,017 --> 00:42:37,393
but we won't stay here long.

674
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,770
But what do you mean?

675
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:41,105
Tomorrow you and I will go looking
for a little apartment.

676
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:43,357
Say, that's right.
I'd forgotten all about that.

677
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:45,485
We do need a little place in town.

678
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:48,905
- Say, what are you driving at?
- Don't you know where we are?

679
00:42:49,072 --> 00:42:51,282
- We're home.
- Home?

680
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:54,202
- Our home?
- Yes. I've been saving it for a surprise.

681
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:55,161
Surprise!

682
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:57,580
[all] Surprise!

683
00:42:57,747 --> 00:43:00,708
[clamoring]

684
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:06,089
[chattering continues]

685
00:43:07,673 --> 00:43:10,968
Everyone, a little drink
for the homecoming.

686
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:14,097
[chattering]

687
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:15,723
To the homecoming!

688
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:18,643
Jolly times and happy moments.

689
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,645
[cheering]

690
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:26,234
They're both too happy for words, Hughie.

691
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:30,863
Isn't it wonderful? To think they've been
to every spot in Europe.

692
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,241
England, France, Germany,

693
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:35,535
Italy, Switzerland. Everywhere.

694
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:38,579
Yes. Well, I don't wanna discourage ya.

695
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:41,582
But a rolling stone gathers no moss.

696
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,627
Dick has a wonderful wife.

697
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:46,462
I'm so glad.

698
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:50,883
Didn't they ask you over to the house?

699
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,678
This is their first night
in their new home,

700
00:43:53,845 --> 00:43:56,305
and they want to be alone and quiet.

701
00:43:56,764 --> 00:43:59,767
-[music playing]
-[chattering]

702
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:11,404
Well, Mr. Parker,
I'm ready to go back on the job.

703
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:13,781
That's great. I'm glad to hear it.

704
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:16,284
We've got a fine office for you, son,

705
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,203
-and we're going to keep you mighty busy.
- Oh, that's great.

706
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,413
[chuckles]

707
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,998
Well, we've got to be going.

708
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:32,925
I'm going to say good night, Dick.

709
00:44:33,092 --> 00:44:35,261
You see,
I think you and Dot ought to be alone.

710
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:37,847
Oh, by the way, where is Dot?
I want to say good night to her.

711
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:38,931
Well, I don't know.

712
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:40,850
Oh, well, never mind.
I'll see her again later.

713
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:41,809
All right.

714
00:44:41,976 --> 00:44:43,978
Come, Llewllyn, we must go. Good night.

715
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:45,479
- Good night.
- Good night, Llewllyn.

716
00:44:45,646 --> 00:44:47,190
Well, Dick, we'll have to go, too.

717
00:44:48,107 --> 00:44:50,651
Tell me, how did the boyfriend behave?

718
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,320
Did he sleep in his overalls?

719
00:44:52,486 --> 00:44:54,447
What do you care what he slept in?

720
00:44:54,614 --> 00:44:56,741
Can't you do anything
besides knock people?

721
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:59,660
Mm. Now, listen, Dot,
you think you're kidding me,

722
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:01,579
but you're only kidding yourself.

723
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:04,207
About Dick? Oh, you're crazy.

724
00:45:04,373 --> 00:45:06,417
Oh, this marriage can't last.

725
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,753
I've never seen one that could,
and you know it's true.

726
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,547
- But Dick and I are different.
- I know.

727
00:45:11,714 --> 00:45:13,674
But he just doesn't belong
with this crowd.

728
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:16,886
Don't worry about him. He will
before I get through with him.

729
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:19,847
Ah, you're gonna have a tough time
making a tea hound out of that...

730
00:45:20,014 --> 00:45:21,891
uh, what do you call him?

731
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:23,726
Oh, yes, steel boss.

732
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:24,769
What's the matter?

733
00:45:24,936 --> 00:45:26,520
If you don't stop razzing Dick...

734
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:29,815
Oh, I'm sorry. Won't you forgive me?

735
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,526
Yes, if it won't happen again.

736
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:34,654
It won't. I promise.

737
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,405
Cross my heart. See?

738
00:45:37,323 --> 00:45:41,494
Listen, just to prove that we're still
good friends, how about a little kiss?

739
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,080
Just one, Charlie. [giggles]

740
00:45:50,169 --> 00:45:51,170
Uh-oh.

741
00:45:57,343 --> 00:46:00,596
Aren't you forgetting your friends?
They're all going home.

742
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:02,765
Well, if that's the case,
I guess I better go along.

743
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,226
- Good night, Dot.
- Good night, Charlie.

744
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,061
Good night, Dick.

745
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:10,398
Sorry, Dick. I'll bid them good night.

746
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:17,571
[chattering]

747
00:46:17,738 --> 00:46:19,031
- Good night, Dot.
- Good night.

748
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:21,742
[all] Good night.

749
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:27,248
- Good night, Dot.
- Good night.

750
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:28,833
Good night, Dick. Good night, Dot.

751
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,251
- Good night.
- I had a lovely time.

752
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:32,128
That's good. Come again, will ya?

753
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:53,482
Well?

754
00:46:53,649 --> 00:46:55,359
What have you got to say for yourself?

755
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:57,611
- Wasn't it a swell party?
- You know what I mean.

756
00:46:57,778 --> 00:47:00,364
- No, what?
- Your necking with Bates.

757
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:03,576
Oh, Dick, don't be silly.
I've known Charlie all my life.

758
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:05,369
That doesn't make any difference.

759
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:08,372
You don't mean to tell me
you're jealous. [laughs]

760
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:11,542
You just bet I am.
I don't care very much for Mr. Bates.

761
00:47:11,709 --> 00:47:14,628
Now, look, Charlie's all right.
Don't go worrying about that.

762
00:47:14,795 --> 00:47:17,423
Listen, Dot, don't ever
let it happen again.

763
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:20,801
Why, of course, I won't
if you feel that way about it.

764
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:24,221
Come on, now. Let's go
and inspect the house, huh?

765
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:26,974
- Now, wait a minute. We can't stay here.
- Why not?

766
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:30,019
It isn't right. It's too much.
Your father's been too kind to us.

767
00:47:30,186 --> 00:47:33,022
Besides, I could never
support this place on my salary.

768
00:47:33,189 --> 00:47:34,774
Is that all that's bothering you?

769
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,735
Yes. And that's why
we're going into a smaller place.

770
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:42,531
Oh, Dick. Oh, I'll be so disappointed.
Why, I've planned everything.

771
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:43,991
I know, dear, but...

772
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:47,787
Now, look, Dick, what would everybody say
if we left this house?

773
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:53,376
Ah, Dick, you'd do this
for your little Kittens, won't you?

774
00:48:05,846 --> 00:48:08,182
Oh, I'd do anything in the world for you.

775
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,142
Oh...

776
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:33,249
Hello, Hughie.
How's everything at the factory?

777
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:36,961
Sufficient under the day
is the evil thereafter.

778
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:39,255
Why, what do you mean?

779
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:42,299
That son of yours
is gettin' pretty high-handed.

780
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:45,803
Well, a friend in need is a friend indeed.

781
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,389
Why? What has Dick done?

782
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:51,392
It ain't what he's done,
it's what he ain't done.

783
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,353
He won't even get me
that job as boss puddler.

784
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,189
Why, I do more work
around there now than he does.

785
00:48:57,356 --> 00:49:00,234
He don't do nothin'.
He's the joke of the joint.

786
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:01,652
Oh, now, Hughie, I'm sure--

787
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:06,115
Well, he won't high-hat this baby
any longer. I'm through with him.

788
00:49:06,615 --> 00:49:09,994
We are known by the company
we do not keep.

789
00:49:31,348 --> 00:49:32,641
Good morning, Miss Bell.

790
00:49:35,895 --> 00:49:36,896
Good morning.

791
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:38,481
Any calls?

792
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:40,983
Yes. Mr. Parker's
been trying to get you all morning.

793
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,693
Said he'd call after lunch.

794
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,029
And Mrs. Brunton called,
said she'd call back.

795
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:46,322
Oh, fine.

796
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:16,810
[phone rings]

797
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,979
Hello?

798
00:50:19,605 --> 00:50:21,065
Oh, yes. Just a moment, please.

799
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:22,816
Mrs. Brunton on the wire, Mr. Brunton.

800
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:23,901
Thank you.

801
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:27,530
Hello, Kitten.

802
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:31,492
I just wanted to remind you, dear,
I'll meet you at the recital at 2:30.

803
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:33,661
And don't forget
we're due at the Ritz at 5:00.

804
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:37,957
Oh, yes. And Rose Clayton's giving us
that big dinner party at the club tonight.

805
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:41,794
All right.

806
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:43,921
Good-bye, sweetheart.

807
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:49,343
Any orders, Mr. Brunton?

808
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:52,471
Due at the recital at 2:30,

809
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:54,723
the Ritz at 5:00, and...

810
00:50:55,975 --> 00:50:57,518
Oh, never mind about that.

811
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:05,734
Well, Dick.

812
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:09,196
- I've got big news for you.
- Is that so?

813
00:51:09,363 --> 00:51:10,656
Looking for you all morning.

814
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:13,993
- Well, I'm sorry I didn't feel very well.
- Oh, that's all right.

815
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,079
You still think Barbour's idea
about that bridge is practical?

816
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:17,997
I know it is.

817
00:51:18,163 --> 00:51:20,291
You know it's against
all theories of engineering?

818
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,793
Yes, but this bridge
won't be built on theories.

819
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,505
It'll be built on brains and imagination
and concrete and steel.

820
00:51:26,672 --> 00:51:28,549
- Mm.
- Why, look at this.

821
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:31,802
Now, when Barbour planned
to put those steel girders--

822
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,679
That's all right. That's far enough.

823
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:36,724
I just wanted to know
if you were still sold on the idea.

824
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,560
- More than ever.
- Fine. That's just the way I feel.

825
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:41,645
What I want to tell you is this:

826
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:45,524
I've made up my mind
to take the biggest gamble of my life.

827
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:49,528
I am going to win
this contract with that bridge.

828
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:52,656
You'll never make it.
You know what you're up against, don't ya?

829
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:55,534
A bunch of old fogies
who can't see anything new or original.

830
00:51:55,701 --> 00:52:00,080
Yeah. The thing I need most is a man
who knows this idea from every angle,

831
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,042
a man who will set them afire
with his own enthusiasm,

832
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:07,338
a man who gets whatever he goes after,
no matter how tough the opposition.

833
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:09,173
You mean Barbour?

834
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,759
No, he's an inventor. I want a salesman.

835
00:52:12,092 --> 00:52:15,387
The man I've picked out
to put this thing over is...

836
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,389
-you.
- Me?

837
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:19,600
Yes. If you can sell
a hard-boiled egg like me,

838
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:21,352
you can certainly sell
those St. Louis boys.

839
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:22,311
You bet I can!

840
00:52:22,478 --> 00:52:23,729
[laughs] Of course you can.

841
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:26,857
All you need to do is put that
ol' fighting football spirit into it

842
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:27,775
and you can't fail.

843
00:52:27,941 --> 00:52:29,443
Don't you worry. I won't fail you.

844
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,321
- Why, son, it's the chance of a lifetime.
- I know it is.

845
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:33,405
I'll catch the next train.

846
00:52:33,572 --> 00:52:35,866
Now, take it easy.
Time enough for that tonight.

847
00:52:36,033 --> 00:52:39,745
What we'll do is spend this afternoon
going over this thing from A to Z

848
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:41,830
so there won't be any chance of a slipup.

849
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:44,124
Oh, boy. Just wait till I tell Dot.

850
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:47,252
Won't she be proud to know
that you gave me this big job?

851
00:52:48,587 --> 00:52:49,755
How long will I be away?

852
00:52:49,922 --> 00:52:51,131
About two weeks.

853
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:53,717
- Great. I'll take her with me.
- Fine.

854
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:57,221
Now, come on. We'll go over to the office
and go through this thing thoroughly.

855
00:52:57,388 --> 00:52:58,514
[Dick] All right.

856
00:53:02,184 --> 00:53:03,602
That's fine, Mary.

857
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:07,690
By the way, did Mr. Brunton call
and say he'd be detained?

858
00:53:07,856 --> 00:53:09,483
No. No, madame.

862

Oh, Dot, I've got the grandest news.

863
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:25,499
Good heavens! Where have you been?

864
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,543
Oh, my gosh. I forgot to call ya.

865
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:31,380
Yes. You didn't come to the recital.
You didn't show up at the Ritz.

866
00:53:31,547 --> 00:53:34,550
And here it is nearly 8:00, and you know
very well we're due at that party.

867
00:53:34,717 --> 00:53:37,511
Oh, but wait.
Gee, your father is a grand ol' scout.

868
00:53:37,678 --> 00:53:39,972
He's given me the biggest job
in the history of the company.

869
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:42,266
- You can tell me all about it later.
- No, I can't.

870
00:53:42,433 --> 00:53:44,893
- We're leaving for St. Louis tonight.
- What?

871
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,520
Sure, you and I.

872
00:53:46,979 --> 00:53:48,313
Have you gone out of your head?

873
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,316
Of course, I have. Now, come on
and get your things packed.

874
00:53:57,322 --> 00:54:00,617
Have you forgotten the Claytons are giving
a dinner in our honor at the club tonight?

875
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:03,537
Oh, dickens with the dinner.
We're shoving off for St. Louis.

Ah, Kitten, what's the matter?

Matter? Well, of all the crazy stunts,
going to St. Louis.

883
00:54:43,952 --> 00:54:45,496
I'll give father a piece of my mind.

884
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:47,623
Oh, but, Kitten,
it's the chance of a lifetime.

885
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,167
It'll be a great trip for you
and a nice change for two weeks.

886
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:53,962
Two weeks?
At the top of the season? What a chance.

887
00:54:54,338 --> 00:54:56,048
Ah, it'd be like a second honeymoon.

888
00:54:56,215 --> 00:54:59,092
Well, I've decided you're not to go.
That's all there is to it.

889
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:06,225
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'll tell Dad a thing or two.

890

Riverside-6826.

891
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:10,646
- Oh, give me that.
- Oh, no.

892
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:13,899
I'm going to St. Louis
and you're going with me.

893
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:16,235
With a book full of engagements?
I guess not.

894
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,445
Well, then, it looks
as if I'll have to go alone.

895
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:21,448
Oh. And you'd leave me
all alone for two weeks?

896
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:23,408
I can't help it. Business is business.

897
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,703
And you think more of business
than you do about me?

898
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,872
Now, you know it isn't that at all.

899
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,666
Ah, don't let's quarrel about it.

900
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,417
I don't wanna quarrel either, dear.

901
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,837
You do love
your little Kittens, don't you?

902
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:36,004
And you won't go away

903
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:38,966
and leave your little Kittens
all alone for two weeks, will you?

904
00:55:39,132 --> 00:55:40,759
Oh, I do love you, Dot.

905
00:55:43,262 --> 00:55:45,806
- But I've got to go.
- Well, go if you want to!

906
00:55:45,973 --> 00:55:47,307
Oh, now, be reasonable.

907
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:50,644
Be reasonable, huh?
Go to St. Louis. Don't let me keep you.

908
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:53,021
I'll find someone
who'll be glad to take me out.

909
00:55:53,188 --> 00:55:54,940
- Oh, now, listen...
- No.

910
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,654
Aren't you gonna say good-bye, Dot?

911
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:53,415
Good-bye.

914
00:57:09,598 --> 00:57:11,141
Then go to St. Louis!

00:57:12,351 --> 00:57:13,518
Ooh!

917
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:28,283
You don't mean to tell me
you left her crying?

918
00:57:29,451 --> 00:57:31,536
Dick, I'm ashamed of you.

919
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:34,414
- Well, can't you see? It wasn't my fault.
- Oh, wasn't it?

920
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:35,540
She made her plans,

921
00:57:35,707 --> 00:57:37,793
and you rushed in
without warning and upset them.

922
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,587
- But mine were more important.
- Oh, yes, to you.

923
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:43,757
But her plans might've been
just as important to her.

924
00:57:44,299 --> 00:57:46,343
Well, I... I never thought of that.

925
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,887
Now, you go on right home
and smooth it over.

926
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:50,847
But I can't. I haven't time.

927
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:55,060
You've got to find time.
You can't leave her like this.

928
00:57:55,227 --> 00:57:59,022
Why, there's no telling what might happen.
A high-spirited girl like her.

929
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:00,273
What could I do?

930
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,820
Take her in your arms
and ask her to forgive you.

931
00:58:04,987 --> 00:58:06,238
And give up the trip?

932
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:08,740
You won't have to give up anything.

933
00:58:08,907 --> 00:58:12,077
But be fair to her.
Don't ask her to give up anything either.

934
00:58:12,244 --> 00:58:13,912
But what if she insists.

935
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,875
Just take her in your arms the right way,
and she won't insist.

936
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:23,922
I'll bet you'll find her all packed up
and waiting for you to ask her.

1007
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:14,462
You're a cute, little kitten.

1008
01:03:14,629 --> 01:03:15,547
Kitten?

1009
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:27,642
Kitten? Why, you're a little hellcat.

1010
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:32,063
Ah... the perils of the big city.
Isn't any working girl safe?

1011
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:34,899
Not with this fiend in human form.

1012
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:36,776
Unhand me, Jack Dalton.

1013
01:03:36,943 --> 01:03:40,113
Think of my reputation! Please!

1014
01:03:42,824 --> 01:03:44,200
Just think of mine.

1015
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:47,162
Why, if I let you go,
it'd be fatal to my reputation.

1016
01:03:47,329 --> 01:03:48,079
[squeals]

1017
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:49,247
Wait, wait!

1018
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:52,625
If you come one step nearer,
I'll plunge this dagger in my heart.

1019
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:55,045
All right,
clown if you want to, but don't forget:

1020
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:57,547
- The villain still pursues her.
-[gasps]

1021
01:03:57,714 --> 01:04:00,925
- Ah-ha!
- No, honestly, Charlie. You slay me.

1022
01:04:01,092 --> 01:04:02,719
Your technique is rotten.

1023
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:05,972
Yes? Well, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

1024
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:07,265
[gasps]

1025
01:04:07,432 --> 01:04:10,310
Wait! What am I supposed to do now?
Scream. I know.

1026
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,103
How loud can you scream?

1027
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:13,521
[whimpering]

1028
01:04:13,688 --> 01:04:14,939
Not loud enough.

1029
01:04:15,106 --> 01:04:16,232
[whimpering]

1030
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:18,526
Will the marines never come?

1031
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:20,779
Hark, hark! What's that?

1032
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:26,117
It's the United States Cavalry, boys!

1033
01:04:26,284 --> 01:04:30,288
We are ashamed! [laughing]

1034
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:32,082
[laughing]

1035
01:04:32,665 --> 01:04:35,168
[both laughing]

1036
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:42,467
There you are, Dot. You win.

1037
01:04:42,842 --> 01:04:44,511
Well, stay awhile. Don't rush off.

1038
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:48,223
I'd love to, Charlie, but I've got to be
up first thing in the morning.

1039
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:50,433
Yes? What's the big idea?

1040
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,436
I'm going to grab
the first train for St. Louis.

1041
01:04:55,563 --> 01:04:57,148
I'll get your wrap for you.

1042
01:05:16,209 --> 01:05:18,878
[car approaching]

1043
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:28,555
- Good night, Charlie.
- Good night, Dot.

1044
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:30,473
-[Charlie] Good night.
-[Dot] Night.

1045
01:05:45,738 --> 01:05:48,700
[clock ringing]

1046
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:58,376
Why, Dick!
I thought you'd gone to St. Louis.

1047
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:00,795
[giggles]

1048
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:03,298
[giggling]

1049
01:06:12,223 --> 01:06:13,600
Where have you been?

1050
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:16,936
- You know, Rose and Bob Clayton?
- Yes.

1051
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:18,855
At the party, remember?

1052
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:21,316
- Must've been some party.
- Oh, it was.

1053
01:06:21,483 --> 01:06:23,610
- It was an awful brawl.
- Lots to drink?

1054
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:26,154
Barrels. Why?

1055
01:06:26,321 --> 01:06:28,031
'Cause those parties
usually don't break up

1056
01:06:28,198 --> 01:06:30,200
until they've cleaned out
the last bottle of booze.

1057
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:32,327
- And it's pretty late.
- Yes, I know.

1058
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:35,371
But you see, uh-- Oh, Rose passed out.

1059
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:37,999
And-- And Bob asked me
to take care of her.

1060
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,001
- Anything serious?
- Oh, no.

1061
01:06:40,168 --> 01:06:42,545
Just a bad head.
But, oh, she's all right now.

1062
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:43,963
Mm-hmm. That's good.

1063
01:06:55,725 --> 01:06:57,018
Oh, Dick.

1064
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,280
Dick, let me explain.

1065
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:10,615
You don't have to.

1066
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:12,867
You were with Bates,
and I can guess the rest.

1067
01:07:13,034 --> 01:07:14,786
But, Dick, I want to tell you the truth.

1068
01:07:14,953 --> 01:07:16,079
Don't bother.

1069
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,456
Don't you love me anymore?

1070
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:20,959
Why don't you ask yourself
the same question?

1071
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,085
But you know I do.

1072
01:07:22,252 --> 01:07:24,587
- I don't know anything of the kind.
- Why, I just told you.

1073
01:07:24,754 --> 01:07:27,507
Yes, you've told me a lot of things,
but I don't believe you.

1074
01:07:27,674 --> 01:07:28,424
Oh, Dick...

1075
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:30,677
You expect me to believe
a liar and a cheat?

1076
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:33,137
- You dare say that to me?
- Well, that's what you are!

1077
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:35,682
- You didn't give me a chance to tell you.
- You've had your chance.

1078
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:38,017
- You've told me enough.
- I can account for everything!

1079
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:40,979
I don't doubt that. All your friends
weren't drunk and put in jail.

1080
01:07:41,145 --> 01:07:43,022
I know all about you and Charlie Bates.

1081
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,983
That's just it.
You don't know a thing about it!

1082
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,067
Well, I can guess.

1083
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:49,195
I'm well-acquainted with the rotten habits
of that crowd you trot around with.

1084
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:50,280
The rotten crowd, eh?

1085
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:52,323
I notice you don't mind
trotting around with them!

1086
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:54,576
Oh, don't I? I only did it to please you.

1087
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:56,744
Hmm! You accept their friendship
and hospitality,

1088
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:58,204
then you turn around and call them--

1089
01:07:58,371 --> 01:08:01,749
A rotten bunch of pasty-faced,
loose-lipped wasters. Parasites!

1090
01:08:03,084 --> 01:08:05,336
Parasites? Well, that's good!

1091
01:08:07,338 --> 01:08:08,965
That sounds fine coming from you.

1092
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:12,135
Why, you're in the same class
as Llewllyn Post. Only you won't admit it!

1093
01:08:12,302 --> 01:08:14,929
Oh, I'll admit it.
I'm nothing but a kept husband.

1094
01:08:15,263 --> 01:08:17,890
Since you put it that way,
that's just what you are!

1095
01:08:18,308 --> 01:08:19,809
That's just what I was.

1096
01:08:19,976 --> 01:08:21,894
"Was"? What are you going to do?

1097
01:08:22,061 --> 01:08:24,272
Quit. I'm through with you
and I'm through with all this.

1098
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:26,858
Through chiseling your father
out of all that money I don't earn

1099
01:08:27,025 --> 01:08:28,443
just to be your lap dog.

1100
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,945
Oh, is that so?
Well, you can keep all of that stuff!

1101
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:32,697
There's only one thing I'll keep.

1102
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:33,823
That's my self-respect!

1103
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,991
All right!

1104
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:39,495
I won't give you back this engagement ring
because I paid for it myself.

1105
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:42,665
But you can give this
back to your mother. Here.

1106
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,549
Good-bye, Mr. Brunton!
My lawyers will call you up in a few days.

1107
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:53,760
Don't hold me up for too much alimony.

1108
01:08:53,926 --> 01:08:54,802
[door slams]

1109
01:09:03,603 --> 01:09:06,731
You don't look so snappy
this morning, Mrs. Brunton.

1110
01:09:08,232 --> 01:09:11,819
I didn't sleep a wink all night,
worried about Dick.

1111
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:15,198
Ah, he's all right. He takes after you.

1112
01:09:15,782 --> 01:09:18,451
Great oaks from little acorns grow.

1113
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:23,206
I know everything's all right,
but still I...

1114
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,251
Say, ya ain't gonna raise my room rent

1115
01:09:27,418 --> 01:09:29,504
just because I'm a boss puddler, are ya?

1116
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:33,007
No, Hughie. You better hurry.

1117
01:09:33,174 --> 01:09:36,511
I never hurry. I claim haste makes waste.

1118
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:38,763
[work horn blows]

1119
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,014
Holy moly!

1120
01:09:49,065 --> 01:09:50,525
- Good morning, Mr. Parker.
- Dawson.

1121
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,862
- Mrs. Brunton downstairs?
- No, sir. She hasn't come down yet today.

1122
01:09:55,029 --> 01:09:55,905
Hmm!

1123
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:01,077
- My daughter in?
- Yes, sir, but you can't see her.

1124
01:10:01,244 --> 01:10:04,372
- Why can't I?
- She's been ill. She hasn't slept.

1125
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:06,791
Well, that's just too bad!

1126
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:33,359
Here. Read that.

1127
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:52,003
Oh, Dad, I'm terribly sorry.

1128
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:53,963
You ought to be.
Though little good it'll do you.

1129
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:54,922
What do you mean?

1130
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:58,009
You almost ruined the biggest deal
the Parker Steel Corporation ever had.

1131
01:10:58,176 --> 01:11:00,720
Yes, and you ruined one of
the finest boys I ever saw.

1132
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:02,263
- I did not.
- I tell you you did.

1133
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:05,725
You rotted his soul,
you killed his manhood and ambition.

1134
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:08,978
When he walked into the office with this,
I thought I was looking at a ghost.

1135
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:11,230
- Why, what has he...?
- I don't know what he's done.

1136
01:11:11,397 --> 01:11:13,232
And I hate to think what he might do.

1137
01:11:13,399 --> 01:11:15,902
I tried to pep him up
and make him take that St. Louis job.

1138
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:17,195
But I'm afraid.

1139
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:18,404
Oh, I'm afraid, too.

1140
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:19,781
You had an infernal nerve

1141
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:22,074
letting your pink tease
interfere with that boy's career.

1142
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:24,660
What right have you to say that to me
when it's all your fault?

1143
01:11:24,827 --> 01:11:26,120
- My fault?
- Yes.

1144
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:28,956
It's no good arguing with you.
You men always stick together.

1145
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:31,501
You can get rid of this house.
I never wanna live in it again!

1146
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,586
You had better get rid
of some of your foolishness.

1147
01:11:33,753 --> 01:11:35,755
And you've got to find that boy
and find him quick.

1148
01:11:35,922 --> 01:11:37,548
And what's more, you're going back to him.

1149
01:11:37,715 --> 01:11:39,592
I won't go back. I won't go back.

1150
01:11:39,759 --> 01:11:42,887
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't,
I won't, I won't! I won't go back!

1151
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:46,516
Well...

1152
01:11:47,892 --> 01:11:49,185
he said good-bye.

1153
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:53,523
But he said he couldn't go to
St. Louis and put that deal over

1154
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:55,107
the way he was feeling.

1155
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:01,405
Mother, I'd give anything
to see him just for a minute.

1156
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:06,577
I'm afraid, dear,
from what you've told me...

1157
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,913
it's too late.

1158
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:14,794
[sobs]

1159
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:22,343
There, there, there, now, dear.
I didn't mean that.

1160
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:27,557
No. It's just that you said it's too late.

1161
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:29,725
Oh, Mother, I've been just rotten.

1162
01:12:29,892 --> 01:12:33,521
No, you haven't, dear.
You've just been human.

1163
01:12:33,688 --> 01:12:36,399
[sobs] But why did I say...

1164
01:12:36,566 --> 01:12:38,442
Oh, why didn't I cut my tongue off?

1165
01:12:38,609 --> 01:12:41,612
You didn't mean it.
Dick should've known you didn't mean it.

1166
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,615
Oh, can you blame him?
Who'd stand for being called...

1167
01:12:44,782 --> 01:12:45,992
Listen, Dorothea...

1168
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:49,036
all husbands are kept.

1169
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,455
Some of them are kept with money,

1170
01:12:51,956 --> 01:12:57,003
but most of them
with love and devotion and sacrifice.

1171
01:12:57,169 --> 01:13:01,215
Why, it's every woman's mission
in life-- keeping her husband.

1172
01:13:02,717 --> 01:13:04,719
Mother. [sobs]

1173
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:14,228
Couldn't you find him, Mr. Hanready?

1174
01:13:14,395 --> 01:13:16,564
- No, didn't he phone in?
- No.

1175
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,442
What can't be cured must be endured.

1176
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:22,320
[door opens, shuts]

1177
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:23,529
Any luck, Hanready.

1178
01:13:23,696 --> 01:13:25,489
No, I couldn't find him anywhere.

1179
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:27,783
Been to every speakeasy in town.

1180
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,745
By George, I wonder--

1181
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:32,580
Say, I think I know where I can find him.

1182
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:34,832
Call my chauffeur
and tell him to bring my car at once.

1183
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:35,875
Yes, sir.

1184
01:13:38,544 --> 01:13:39,545
[door closes]

1185
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:52,058
Connecticut wrapper with asafetida filler.

1186
01:13:55,895 --> 01:13:58,022
Beggars can't be choosers.

1187
01:14:13,204 --> 01:14:15,665
Ah! Boy, I'm glad
you didn't change your mind!

1188
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:17,667
- Mr. Parker.
- I knew you wouldn't fail me.

1189
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:18,709
[conductor] All aboard!

1190
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,753
Don't you worry a minute.
I'll put this deal over,

1191
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,838
but that resignation goes
the minute I get it over.

1192
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,632
We'll talk about that when you get back.

1193
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:28,636
- Good-bye!
- Good luck!

1194
01:14:28,803 --> 01:14:30,846
[train bell dinging]

1195
01:14:31,764 --> 01:14:33,099
[train whistle blows]

1196
01:14:42,608 --> 01:14:44,610
And, boy, bring in a table.

1197
01:14:44,777 --> 01:14:46,278
Yes, sir. Coming right up, boss.

1198
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:56,080
Oh, Dick!

1199
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,418
- What are you doing here?
- Aren't you glad to see me?

1200
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,461
I can't say that. I'm no liar.

1201
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:06,340
Oh, I don't blame you.
I did lie to you, but I'm no cheat.

1202
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:09,343
I couldn't let you go away
without explaining it to you.

1203
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:12,096
Oh, Dick, you must believe me.

1204
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:16,100
- Oh, I do believe you.
- Oh, thanks.

1205
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:18,728
Oh, and, listen, Dick,
I'm gonna get rid of the house.

1206
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:19,979
Well, that's not enough.

1207
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:22,481
We're not gonna be kept
by your father's money any longer.

1208
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,025
Oh, no, never.

1209
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:26,652
Dick, we're going to live on your salary.

1210
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:28,779
But wait a minute.
Will you do me a favor?

1211
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:31,657
- What is it?
- Let's start all over again.

1212
01:15:32,283 --> 01:15:33,826
You propose to me.

1213
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:36,996
Will you be my wife, Dot?

1214
01:15:37,163 --> 01:15:38,289
Yes.

1215
01:15:38,456 --> 01:15:42,043
But this time,
I'm going to keep you in a different way.

1216
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:43,669
[train whistle blows]

1217
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,088
