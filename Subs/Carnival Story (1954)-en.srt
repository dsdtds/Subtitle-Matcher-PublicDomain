1
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:17,423
Attention! Attention!

2
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,291
The Langford express

3
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:22,594
now arriving

4
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,635
The Langford Express

5
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:33,205
now arriving track 6.

6
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:36,042
All right boys, let's go.

7
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:40,379
One two three

8
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,065
Come on fellows.

9
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:00,399
What do you say Joe?

10
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:02,534
You're sure seeing
Europe the hard way.

11
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:04,712
Ah, it's better than dodging
those sheriffs in Kentucky.

12
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:06,272
Besides we might do
pretty good here.

13
00:01:06,305 --> 00:01:07,206
Hi lover, did you miss me?

14
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,441
Miss you! I couldn't
sleep, couldn't eat

15
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:10,442
- couldn't think
- Yeah, ah hah,

16
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:12,678
You couldn't even write
you muscle bound ape.

17
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:13,888
Come on, hurry it up,
get in line.

18
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:16,615
You've got the only good looking
pair of legs in the show.

19
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:18,084
Come on.

20
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:41,573
Ah!

21
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:54,453
Straight from Hawaii.

22
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:57,156
Come on over to the
carnival grounds tonight.

23
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:13,272
Come on out tonight and
see a great show.

24
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:16,408
Let your eyes gaze upon the
wonders of all wonders.

25
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,809
All right, hold it,
hold it, hold it!

26
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,918
Now pat attention everybody.

27
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,761
The cook outs are
straight ahead.

28
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,356
Living quarters over here.

29
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,617
We go on tonight.
I'll meet you in the cook outs

30
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,320
at 6:30 and give you the
rest of the low down. Okay.

31
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,477
All right everybody,
quiet, quiet.

32
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,595
Quiet! Just a moment.

33
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,473
Now you all know why
we're here in Europe.

34
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,300
Back home we didn't do so good.

35
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,014
As a matter of fact,
we didn't do anything.

36
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:54,306
They won't look at you freaks
anymore even if we paid them.

37
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,437
The only one who came
around was a sheriff.

38
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,447
Now this is the first
American carnival

39
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,640
that ever played Germany.

40
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,349
Nobody knows whether they're
going to go for us or not.

41
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,484
But I figure this way,

42
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:07,786
we might turn into a freak
novelty if we give them

43
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:09,888
straight America mud show corn.

44
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,390
So, forget where you are.

45
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,823
Play it straight to
the hillbillies.

46
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,595
Now you talkers, you'll
have to work in German.

47
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:19,498
I've had translations made
of all the ballyhoos.

48
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,533
So you read them right out.

49
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,502
And if we can't talk them in...

50
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:25,871
Pray them in.

51
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,651
The lady with acres of charm.

52
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,321
The one and only Miss Daisy May

53
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:43,722
Captain Snyder

54
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,957
Sword swallower extraordinaire

55
00:04:46,892 --> 00:04:49,261
The human flamethrower.

56
00:04:56,502 --> 00:04:59,271
This is giant Vice Groppo.

57
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:00,806
He was worshiped as a God.

58
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,941
Uh, animist God.

59
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:05,311
By the Dayak tribe of
central Borneo.

60
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,513
Where he was captured
after a terrific battle.

61
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:09,848
Uh... kampf.

62
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:12,418
Here we show him as a gesture

63
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,686
And in American Friendship

64
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,588
to all the people in the world.

65
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:19,758
(Speaking German)

66
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,328
All of these remarkable
little ladies here

67
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:25,664
(Speaking German)

68
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:30,569
(Speaking German)

69
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:32,571
to the Gods of their fathers.

70
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:34,673
Watch the perfect control.

71
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,975
Control

72
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:41,380
Of the 200 separate and
distinct muscles of the, uh...

73
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:46,785
of the belly.

74
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:48,053
Yeah.

75
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,758
All right, 50 cents. 50 cents.

76
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,426
Only 50 pennies.

77
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,961
Come on, only 50 pennies boys

78
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:58,530
and inside works warmer, they
don't wear so many clothes.

79
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,370
There, who's next? You are.

80
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:05,637
Yes sir, thank you.

81
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,871
Thank you very much.
Step up sucker.
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:15,514
(Speaking German)

83
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,048
Come back in half an hour.

84
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,650
(Speaking German)

85
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,373
A cola, honey.

86
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:12,971
(Speaking German)

87
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,002
Thank you.

88
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:56,147
Hey you!

89
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:04,556
(Speaking German)

90
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,024
Oh!

91
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,573
- I'm hungry.
- Hungry?

92
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,524
You're hungry for what? Blood?

93
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:24,743
Suck the wound,
it may be poisonous.

94
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,549
If you're hungry, why don't
you go ahead and eat it.

95
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:34,720
Thank you very much.

96
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,159
You speak pretty good English.

97
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,628
How come?

98
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:44,630
Of course I do

99
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:48,166
A hangover from the time

100
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:57,676
You're a pretty
good looking girl.

101
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,045
So...

102
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,849
You know what might
be good for you.

103
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:07,911
A little time in jail for
picking pockets.

104
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,923
Some honest work.

105
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,027
Can you get me work?

106
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,507
Might get you a job
here in the carnival.

107
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:21,499
I can do anything.
I'm very strong.

108
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,101
You mean it?

109
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:25,867
Yeah.

110
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,675
Come on.
Let's go see.

111
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:36,815
- What's your name?
- Willie.

112
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:38,149
- Villie?
- Willie.

113
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,551
Oh, Willie.

114
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,919
It's not my real name.

115
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:43,054
Someone called me that
one time and it stuck.

116
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:45,957
My name's Joe.
Joe Hammond.

117
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,626
Hi Willie.

118
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:49,695
Alright.

119
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:53,699
Joe!

120
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,967
What's the matter?

121
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,036
I've got some
information for you.

122
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,905
You did not count your money.

123
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:02,874
I think this must be yours.

124
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:06,645
Thanks.

125
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:09,848
Willie, remember this,
anytime you ever catch a thief

126
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:12,984
be sure and search
him very thoroughly.

127
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,592
Charley!

128
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,028
Charley.

129
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:27,734
Well, uh, looks like we're
doing all right now, huh?

130
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,101
Yeah. They're really going
for that Tennessee Dutch.

131
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:32,904
Oh, uh, this is Willie.

132
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,447
Willie? From here
it looks like a girl.

133
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:37,709
I think she is.

134
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,145
She'd like to join up
with us Charley.

135
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,212
Oh now listen Joe,

136
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,248
I can't put everybody
you pick up on the payroll.

137
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:45,250
No, no, look.
This is an exception.

138
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:48,119
She's going to, uh... She's
going to teach me German.

139
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,821
You know, to help
out with the spiel.

140
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,704
What else can she do?

141
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,325
Now this is serious.

142
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,903
You can put her to
work in the cook house.

143
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:58,396
- Washing dishes.
- I will do anything Mr. Grayson

144
00:10:58,429 --> 00:10:59,998
Even a few days
work will help me.

145
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:03,089
Okay. Sleep her with the
hula dancers, I guess.

146
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:05,771
You show up at the cook
house at 6:30 in the morning.

147
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,172
Thank you, Mr. Grayson.

148
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,396
Ahh.

149
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,522
Oh don't worry about him.
He's harmless.

150
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,682
I had him released from
the asylum in Alabama.

151
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,076
- He's
- No No No No No.

152
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,565
No he's just a little stupid.
And he's a dummy.

153
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,655
You know. He can't talk.

154
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:28,093
Go back to your tent Groppo.
Go back to your tent!

155
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,894
- Kids.
- Get out of here ya Tom.

156
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:47,112
- Shut that flap.
- Oh shut up a minute.

157
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:49,380
Come on. Come on!

158
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:52,350
This is Willie. She's
gonna stay with you a while.

159
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:55,086
Well baby this is your new home.

160
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:58,790
What's the matter?

161
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:07,198
- Um
- What's the matter?

162
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:11,180
Look uh, I've been traveling.

163
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,172
I'm unclean.

164
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,975
I'd be ashamed for
them to see me.

165
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:19,778
Is there some place where
I could take a bath?

166
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,046
Sure.

167
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:25,796
Hey uh. I guess the only clothes
you own are the ones you got on

168
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:28,186
Yes.

169
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,982
Well. I think we can find
something for you.

170
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:32,891
Come on.

171
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,403
Which one do I pull?

172
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:48,039
- What do you want hot or cold?
- I want hot.

173
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,941
Then pull the one on the right.

174
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:54,279
Huh! Ahh! Oh! Oh it's cold!

175
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:58,016
- It takes a little while.
- Ah! Oh No!

176
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:03,387
Ahh! Umm!

177
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,395
Ahhh.

178
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:17,924
You wet all over?

179
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:20,338
Um. All over.

180
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:22,908
Let go of the chain
and soap yourself.

181
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,446
Oh.

182
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,084
Soap is expensive you know.

183
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:36,922
Oh it feels so good.

184
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,879
You all soaped all over?

185
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:42,393
Every bit of me.

186
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:45,230
I'm all smothered in bubbles.

187
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:48,466
I'm all slippery in
soap and it's wet.

188
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:50,301
Then go ahead and rinse off.

189
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:54,039
Oh. Oh I hate to do it.

190
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:29,307
How do you feel now?

191
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,976
Uh. Clean.

192
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,077
You look clean.

193
00:14:33,344 --> 00:14:36,347
- Umm. You smell clean.
- Ha ha.

194
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,317
- I bet you taste clean too.
- No, no. Please don't.

195
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,453
What's the matter? What's this.
You've been kissed before.

196
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:45,924
What difference does that make?
I've been married before.

197
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,259
Would that make you
want to marry me?

198
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,896
I've been hurt before. Would
that make you want to hurt me?

199
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:54,199
Uh-huh. I don't
want to hurt you.

200
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:12,362
No. Please, please.

201
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,252
What's the matter?

202
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:17,956
You said I'd been kissed before.

203
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:21,292
Yes I have. Many times.

204
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,428
But.

205
00:15:23,461 --> 00:15:24,963
But what?

206
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,498
I'll tell you only this.

207
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,035
For me you're different.

208
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:33,538
Don't take from me.

209
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:37,008
Let me give.

210
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,253
Oh? When.

211
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:43,953
When, when I've had
time to think a little.

212
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:25,991
Hi!

213
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:29,417
- Hi!
- Hi!

214
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:32,130
What's for supper tonight?

215
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,999
Meatloaf!

216
00:16:34,223 --> 00:16:36,592
You're the new girl in
the cook tent aren't you?

217
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,536
How did you guess?

218
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,395
What are you doing up there?

219
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,006
Testing the gi wire.

220
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:47,985
Oh.

221
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:08,599
Say. I used to pay the
other girl a little extra

222
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,036
to bring a pot of coffee to
my tent just after the act.

223
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,703
That be ok with you?

224
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:16,407
Be glad to. You have
sugar and cream?

225
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:17,742
Black.

226
00:17:28,092 --> 00:17:29,927
Ladies and gentlemen

227
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:33,214
The amazing act from
the Colloni wonder show

228
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:36,261
From the height of 110 feet

229
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:43,268
Uh, I mean Uh
(attempting German)

230
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:46,704
Still trying to speak German.

231
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:51,076
Which is only six feet deep.

232
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:55,012
Uh, (attempting German)

233
00:17:56,214 --> 00:18:00,251
Ladies and gentlemen
the great Colloni.

234
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:05,443
- Here's the coffee.
- Fine just put it on the chair.

235
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,722
Now that's real service.

236
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:19,890
How do you say thanks in German?

237
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:21,492
Danke schoen.

238
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:23,261
- Danke schoen.
- And you deserve it.

239
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:24,729
I saw your dive.

240
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,564
Like it?

241
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,534
Well you're very brave but it

242
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,768
frightened me.

243
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:34,405
Ha. It would probably scare me
too if I saw it from the ground.

244
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,942
Ooh. I've got a headache.

245
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,778
You get them often?
- Once in a while.

246
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:42,380
Depends how I hit.

247
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,583
Will you let me rub your neck?
I used to be good at it.

248
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:47,752
Alright.

249
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,425
Um.

250
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,431
You've got strong hands.

251
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:03,734
- Hard work makes strong hands.
- They always do hard work?

252
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:05,570
Not always.

253
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,263
Who are you?
Where you from?

254
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,676
That's not important.

255
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:12,977
Ah. It's wonderful.

256
00:21:13,844 --> 00:21:15,646
My headache feels
better already.

257
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Thank you.

258
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,817
It was a very quick cure.

259
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:25,290
Would you mind walking
across the room please?

260
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:27,613
Why?

261
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,760
I want to see how you move.
How you carry yourself.

262
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:33,698
Very well.

263
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:48,245
You mind taking off your dress?

264
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:51,630
At some times there are phrases
in English I do not understand.

265
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,245
Did you ask me to
take my dress off?

266
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,422
Afraid of me?

267
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,771
I'm not afraid of anyone.

268
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,301
Well?

269
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:13,438
You know what I was thinking?

270
00:22:13,471 --> 00:22:14,972
Probably.

271
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:18,275
You're wrong.

272
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,549
I've been thinking lately
the act might go better

273
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,881
if I had a partner.

274
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:27,418
That's all. Just an idea.

275
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:30,388
- A lady partner?
- That's right. Can you swim?

276
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:33,791
Yes but you were thinking of me.

277
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:37,695
Why not? You've got good legs,
good shoulders, strong hands

278
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:39,105
That's important when
you're coming up.

279
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:41,699
You move well have good balance.

280
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:45,102
Yes but why do you ask me?
There are many who move well.

281
00:22:45,135 --> 00:22:47,538
Well if you don't
want to just say so.

282
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:49,972
I... I don't really mean that I
don't want to it's just that

283
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,743
I'm scared to death
just thinking about it.

284
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:55,480
I know. I used to
be that way myself.

285
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:58,883
But I found you can do anything
you make up your mind to do.

286
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,089
Here. For the coffee.

287
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,824
Oh. Thanks.

288
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:09,093
Why don't you think
about it for a while.

289
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:18,135
I'll be able to earn a great
deal of money wouldn't I?

290
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:20,571
A lot more than you're
making in that cook tent.

291
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:23,551
- A lot more?
- Uh huh.

292
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,376
Think it over.

293
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,412
I will.

294
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:30,615
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

295
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,457
Joe.

296
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,761
- Oh. Hi Willie.
- Hello.

297
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:45,863
What's this? Bedside
service for the great Colloni?

298
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:49,600
Yeah. And uh he said
something tonight

299
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,736
I want to ask you about.

300
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,103
Oh, what?

301
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:55,506
He wants me to be his partner.

302
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,775
In the diving business.
He said he would teach me.

303
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,610
Well.

304
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:02,780
Maybe uh, maybe he's
on the make for you.

305
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:05,049
Oh no. He's very serious.

306
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,384
He said I'd be able to
earn a lot of money.

307
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,620
What did you tell him?

308
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:12,657
I said I'd need a little
time to think about it.

309
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,659
I thought I better
ask you first.

310
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:16,393
Ask me? Why?

311
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:19,697
See if you minded or not.

312
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,965
Mind it.

313
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,968
Baby you've been
overdue for a good break.

314
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,936
You think I'd stand in your way?

315
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,738
No, no, no. I know you wouldn't.

316
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,907
It's very dangerous you know.

317
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,841
Ahh!

318
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,510
I'm afraid.

319
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:35,546
Don't people. People get killed
everyday in the bath tub.

320
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,114
Anything's dangerous.

321
00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:39,149
You really think I could do it?

322
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:40,651
I know you can do it.

323
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,219
But listen you.

324
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:44,855
I don't want that
Wisconsin cheese eater

325
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:46,824
moving in on my girl.

326
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,749
I'm glad you're jealous.

327
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:52,029
Sure I'm jealous.

328
00:24:52,062 --> 00:24:55,966
I um, I gotta go check with
Charlie about the receipts.

329
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,635
See you later.

330
00:24:58,135 --> 00:24:59,637
Night.

331
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,813
Goodnight.

332
00:25:27,164 --> 00:25:30,167
Oh even ten feet
looks high from here.

333
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:31,722
It is.

334
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,860
Ahh!

335
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,645
Lesson number 1. Never look up.
Not even when you're climbing.

336
00:25:40,678 --> 00:25:42,547
- Yeah.
- Never look up.

337
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,014
Now try it.

338
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:47,017
No matter how high you are
take one look down at the tank.

339
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,285
Just one.

340
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:50,487
Then look straight ahead.

341
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,558
Shouldn't I watch you
do it once or twice?

342
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,702
Nope. This is the way to do it.
Now look. You watch me.

343
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,261
Turn around.

344
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:02,232
Soon as your head touches water.
The very instant you feel water

345
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,702
Bring your back full up like
this and reach for air.

346
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:06,303
You do that you
won't touch bottom.

347
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:09,239
You ever do touch bottom
from real height you're gone.

348
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:10,641
Got it?

349
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:12,943
Alright. I'll try it.

350
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:15,680
Alright you go on out to the end
and do exactly what I tell you

351
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:17,247
when I tell you

352
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,122
Alright. Look down just once.

353
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:29,927
Look straight ahead.

354
00:26:31,596 --> 00:26:33,197
Up on your toes.

355
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:36,166
Deep breath.

356
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:39,169
Now fall forward.

357
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,684
You got splattered.

358
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:56,186
Yes. I know.
But how was the rest of it?

359
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,056
Terrible. Now go on up
there and do a good one.

360
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,810
More gravy darling.

361
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:31,088
Oh yeah. Thank you.

362
00:27:36,694 --> 00:27:37,795
Hi.

363
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:40,884
- What's to eat honey?
- Meatloaf.

364
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,734
Honey, my cup's dirty.

365
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:46,003
So is your face my dear.

366
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:48,305
But we can get a new cup.

367
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:53,608
- Don't you dare grin.
- Who's grinning?

368
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:56,346
These dishes need washing.
Hurry up with it.

369
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:03,287
- Well get with it.
- You get with it.

370
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:08,358
You'd feel sorry for
everything that wears skirts.

371
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,319
Come on. It's only 25 feet.

372
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:03,340
I'll mark you up for good.

373
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,080
Cut it out!

374
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,950
You want to fight
take it to the alley.

375
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:14,118
Break it up!

376
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,857
Go on Tami. You'll find
him on top of some fence.

377
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,430
Don't whistle for me.

378
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,547
- Been in a fight?
- Yes. You guess with whom.

379
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:47,564
I don't like it.
Whistling for me.

380
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,864
That's for a dog.

381
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,664
You never let me
know ahead of time.

382
00:30:51,707 --> 00:30:53,375
You never take me out.

383
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:56,577
You just call for me as
if I were your servant.

384
00:30:56,602 --> 00:30:59,605
Baby what kind of a beef is
this? You know I'm busy.

385
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,466
I don't know when
I'm going to be free.

386
00:31:01,899 --> 00:31:03,934
Well, from now on
you have to find out.

387
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:07,573
You must treat me like a
person who has feelings.

388
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:10,275
- Instead of..
- Instead of what?

389
00:31:12,894 --> 00:31:15,229
Instead of what you think I am.

390
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:21,285
Baby I think you're mine too.

391
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:24,078
Anything wrong with that?

392
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:26,290
You shouldn't be so certain.

393
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:28,959
I can't help it if I'm certain.

394
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:34,116
Come on. Lets take a walk. Huh?
- No.

395
00:31:34,364 --> 00:31:36,166
What do you mean no?

396
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,905
I think you are fond
of the that high diver.

397
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,442
I'm not falling for anybody.

398
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:51,315
You're falling for somebody.

399
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:17,583
Alright now I want you to
arch your back more and

400
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:19,409
you get to the surface
faster. You understand?

401
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:21,912
Ok. Otherwise
you're doing alright.

402
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:25,082
Come on. It's only 75 feet.

403
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:27,017
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

404
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:30,520
Now lets see you do
a really good one.

405
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:26,610
- How was it?
- Pretty good.

406
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:28,745
Deserves a little present.

407
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:30,514
You go get dried off.

408
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:33,050
Come over to the tent I
got something for you.

409
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,269
Oh but it's wonderful.

410
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,803
Oh it's so beautiful.

411
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,036
You're going to wear it tonight.

412
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:54,438
Tonight?

413
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:56,640
Sure. You're going
off the top tonight.

414
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:59,009
Oh.

415
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,145
Shouldn't I try it just once?

416
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:04,448
You only hit the top once
in your whole life Willie.

417
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:06,316
After that it's never the same.

418
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,752
There's only one way to
hit the top the first time.

419
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:11,188
Right out there where the music
is playing and everybody

420
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:13,157
in the whole world is watching.

421
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,759
- Yes but...
- Here. Take this.

422
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,329
Go ahead.
Just one.

423
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:30,740
Go on take it.
It'll relax you.

424
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:37,547
There.

425
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,283
You go on to your
tent and lie down.

426
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:40,750
I'll wake you when it's time.

427
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:42,252
- But what if..
- Go on Willie.

428
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:43,753
That stuff hits you fast.

429
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:33,470
Willie.

430
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:37,607
You go on in six minutes.
Time to get dressed.

431
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,210
Six minutes.

432
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:47,117
- Frank I'm frightened.
- Well I should hope so.

433
00:35:47,151 --> 00:35:49,253
If you aren't I'd think
you were crazy.

434
00:36:05,302 --> 00:36:06,903
Ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:09,206
Welcome to the show.

436
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,775
(speaking German)

437
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:14,411
The great Colloni.

438
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:21,851
I should have said
the great Collonis.

439
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:37,594
Look at the town Willie.
Enjoy this feeling.

440
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,704
Look at those lights.

441
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:46,585
See other cities other towns
shining like that tonight.

442
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,986
Be way up here.
Cool and far away and high.

443
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:53,947
Looking down on them.
Never letting them touch you.

444
00:37:57,988 --> 00:38:00,858
The moment I've
been waiting for.

445
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:04,211
I love you very much.

446
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:06,890
I wanted to tell you up here.

447
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:08,458
On your first night.

448
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:13,563
I love you Willie.
I want you to marry me.

449
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:19,595
You can tell me later.

450
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:31,781
Now. You're on your own.

451
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:35,652
Music's over. The act is on.

452
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:09,078
Hey. What's the trouble?

453
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,648
Something happened tonight.

454
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:14,316
Which makes me very unhappy.

455
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:17,587
- Frank asked me to marry him.
- What?

456
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:20,557
The cheese eater
wants to marry you?

457
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,092
Well what do you know.

458
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,128
Why should you be unhappy?

459
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:29,315
Because he's in love with me and

460
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:32,955
I don't love him.

461
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,177
Well uh

462
00:40:36,077 --> 00:40:38,814
Maybe you should
learn to love him.

463
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:40,688
What do you mean by that?

464
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:42,717
That Wisconsin
hillbilly should have

465
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:44,710
a good wad stashed away by now.

466
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,837
You could do a lot worse.

467
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:50,186
But Joe, I...what uh..

468
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,556
You mean about us?

469
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:54,758
Look.

470
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:56,893
We're not going to
let a little thing like

471
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:59,763
you being married
come between us.

472
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:07,437
If you ever touch me again.
I'll kill you.

473
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:29,192
Alright all you
beggars and thieves.

474
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:32,629
Like the man said, ahh
there's good news today.

475
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:35,064
The show's a big hit and
we got a brand new star.

476
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:37,967
And here she is the
other half of the team

477
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:40,203
of the Great Collonis.

478
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:48,945
Thank you.

479
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,947
Thank you very much.

480
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:53,447
This is the happiest
day of my life.

481
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,809
Not only because

482
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:58,970
I really feel a part
of the show now

483
00:41:59,692 --> 00:42:01,193
But because

484
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:04,154
From now on the Collonis are
not just going to be a team

485
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:08,108
They're going to be
Mr. and Mrs. too.

486
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:17,106
Music! Music! Music!

487
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:22,211
Everybody dance.

488
00:42:54,744 --> 00:42:56,012
Frank.

489
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:58,081
Hey Frank.

490
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:00,850
Bill. Bill Vines.
What are you doing here?

491
00:43:00,884 --> 00:43:02,652
I'm here on an assignment
for Life Magazine.

492
00:43:02,686 --> 00:43:04,020
- Wonderful.
- Uh

493
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:05,655
aren't you forgetting something?

494
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:08,758
Oh excuse me.
Willie this is Bill Vines.

495
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:11,628
He was combat photographer
assigned to our regiment when

496
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:12,938
I was peeling spuds
for company K.

497
00:43:12,962 --> 00:43:14,831
- She's my new partner.
- Hello Willie.

498
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:17,834
I uh didn't know Frank had
such a good eye for partners.

499
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:20,303
Come on everybody
kiss the bride.

500
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,041
Alright. Stand in line
and take your turn.

501
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:29,946
Alright next.

502
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:34,083
I'm not going to
miss out on this.

503
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,697
You're getting a swell guy.
All the luck in the world.

504
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:41,257
Thank you. No, Groppo,
Groppo. You too.

505
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:45,094
Come on. Come on
and kiss the bride.

506
00:43:46,763 --> 00:43:48,865
Ahhh.

507
00:43:48,898 --> 00:43:51,567
Lift her up so we
can all see it Groppo.

508
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,302
What do you want?

509
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:42,712
Uh, nothing I guess.

510
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,015
Just thought I'd drop over
and see how you're doing.

511
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:47,717
How things are going.

512
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:49,967
They go very well and
you shouldn't be here.

513
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,889
Yes you're right, but

514
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:54,891
Baby

515
00:45:56,325 --> 00:45:58,161
I never see you alone anymore.

516
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,963
You saw me alone.

517
00:46:00,229 --> 00:46:02,465
You'll see me alone for
the rest of your life.

518
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:04,500
You didn't want us this way.

519
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:06,410
I know.

520
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:08,271
I made a mistake.

521
00:46:09,806 --> 00:46:11,140
I'm made it but

522
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:14,377
it doesn't mean I
have to like it this way.

523
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:18,219
No. But there's nothing
I can do about it now.

524
00:46:19,348 --> 00:46:21,284
I guess not.

525
00:46:22,451 --> 00:46:23,820
Oh there is

526
00:46:25,088 --> 00:46:27,023
There's one thing you
could do for me.

527
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,491
Uh.

528
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,861
You see I uh, I got
myself in a jam and

529
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,830
I need a couple hundred bucks.

530
00:46:33,863 --> 00:46:35,240
I thought maybe you could let
me have it for a few days...

531
00:46:35,264 --> 00:46:36,099
I haven't got it.

532
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:37,867
What do you mean
you haven't got it?

533
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,781
Frank takes care of our money.
I haven't got it.

534
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:46,332
Well.

535
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,345
Thanks anyway.

536
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:53,249
Baby.

537
00:46:54,117 --> 00:46:55,885
Something else I need.

538
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,121
You've got it.

539
00:46:58,154 --> 00:46:59,823
No Joe.

540
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:02,158
Maybe I can get the money quick.

541
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:04,994
Soon as I can. Maybe
tonight maybe tomorrow.

542
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:06,930
You've got to go.

543
00:47:08,064 --> 00:47:10,433
Alright. I'll see you tonight.

544
00:47:10,967 --> 00:47:13,803
Meet me at the uh carousel.

545
00:47:13,837 --> 00:47:16,906
Better make it about 12:00.
He'll be asleep by then.

546
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,934
Ahh. You're crazy.

547
00:47:19,575 --> 00:47:22,220
Frank finds you here I don't
know what he'll do to you.

548
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:24,184
I'll take that chance.

549
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:28,843
See you tonight.

550
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,801
- Hello Mrs. Colloni.
- Hello.

551
00:47:43,662 --> 00:47:45,697
I saw him come out of
here you dirty little cheat.

552
00:47:45,926 --> 00:47:47,928
- And if you ever do it again..
- Be quiet.

553
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,357
- Well hello, Frank.
- Hi ya, Peggy.

554
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:52,876
See you later doll.

555
00:47:52,987 --> 00:47:54,321
So long.

556
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:57,595
What was she doing here?

557
00:47:57,931 --> 00:47:59,733
Borrowing thread.

558
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,775
I don't like these
Sunday afternoon shows. I

559
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:04,361
I like the lights when I dive.

560
00:48:04,386 --> 00:48:06,588
Wanna get dressed?
We go on in 20 minutes.

561
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:16,465
Ladies and gentlemen. I want you
to meet the wonder of our show.

562
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:19,302
The fire eater extraordinary.

563
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:23,172
Captain Schnieder he heats
the swords in the fire.

564
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:53,036
Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome
to our show. I now present the

565
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:55,371
Great Collonis.

566
00:50:48,084 --> 00:50:50,719
You waited a little too long
after you looked at the tank.

567
00:50:50,753 --> 00:50:53,122
- That's dangerous.
- I know.

568
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:54,723
Nothing bothering you is there?

569
00:50:54,757 --> 00:50:58,594
No I just made a mistake. Why
should anything be bothering me?

570
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,633
Come inside so
no one can see us.

571
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:53,282
Look Joe I haven't
got the money.

572
00:51:53,816 --> 00:51:56,319
I couldn't think of way of
asking him without it

573
00:51:56,352 --> 00:51:57,386
seeming strange.

574
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,323
- Don't you know where it is?
- No. I never asked.

575
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:02,458
What kind of dame are you
you don't know where your

576
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:03,859
husband keeps his money.

577
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:06,829
Look. I'll find some other
way to get the money.

578
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:08,859
I've got to go back.

579
00:52:08,904 --> 00:52:10,849
- No baby I don't want you to..
- No get away from me.

580
00:52:11,077 --> 00:52:12,746
Ok.

581
00:52:13,262 --> 00:52:15,764
I told you I'd kill
you and I will.

582
00:52:16,372 --> 00:52:18,307
What's the matter with you?

583
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:22,952
What are you talking
about, you'll kill me.

584
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:26,249
If I knocked you
down and kicked you

585
00:52:26,282 --> 00:52:27,883
you wouldn't do
anything about it.

586
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,652
Couldn't cause
you're in love with me.

587
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:31,320
Couldn't help yourself.

588
00:52:32,673 --> 00:52:34,708
Joe, you hurt me.

589
00:52:35,724 --> 00:52:39,428
Baby, nobody else is ever gonna
come close to you except me.

590
00:52:39,462 --> 00:52:40,629
Nobody ever.

591
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:43,132
You're going back there and
you're gonna get that money

592
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:45,634
and you're gonna bring it to me.
We're gonna leave together.

593
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:46,735
You and me.

594
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:49,705
Oooh Rat!

595
00:52:49,738 --> 00:52:51,507
Aah!

596
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:15,464
Oh Joe.

597
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:22,505
I fight and I fight but it
doesn't do any good.

598
00:53:24,573 --> 00:53:29,612
Until I met you. I never
knew how rotten I was.

599
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:33,282
If you're rotten.
We're both rotten.

600
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:35,251
Two of a kind.

601
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,314
We belong together.

602
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,020
Don't fight it.

603
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,485
Come here Willie.

604
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,375
Frank!

605
00:54:12,488 --> 00:54:14,357
- Frank!
- Get.

606
00:54:45,788 --> 00:54:47,756
No Frank!

607
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:00,569
Frank!

608
00:55:00,603 --> 00:55:03,972
No! Stop it! Stop!

609
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:18,554
Go to your tent.

610
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:21,714
Go to your tent!

611
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:29,898
He's leaving the show
Charlie. Tonight.

612
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:33,035
I ever see you again I'll
really finish the job.

613
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:40,458
I don't want no trouble
in my show Joe.

614
00:55:40,483 --> 00:55:42,886
You better pack your things.

615
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:44,960
Come by my tent I'll
give you your money.

616
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,906
Better start packing. We're
leaving the show tomorrow.

617
00:56:18,082 --> 00:56:19,817
What are we going to do?

618
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,547
I'll tell you what
we're going to do.

619
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,082
We're going to the States
and buy a farm and live on it.

620
00:56:26,114 --> 00:56:28,283
And work on it with
our own hands.

621
00:56:28,816 --> 00:56:31,986
When you're so tired you won't
have ideas of playing around.

622
00:56:33,686 --> 00:56:35,220
I won't go.

623
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:38,149
You'll go where ever I tell ya.

624
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:49,624
Do you think you can move
me around like some varmint?

625
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:52,790
Your cat. I'm not an
animal I'm a human being.

626
00:56:52,815 --> 00:56:55,618
- You don't act like one.
- I won't go.

627
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,054
I don't love you.

628
00:56:58,186 --> 00:56:59,622
I won't go with you.

629
00:56:59,655 --> 00:57:01,624
I hate you. I hate every
man in the world and I

630
00:57:01,657 --> 00:57:02,825
hate you most of all.

631
00:57:02,858 --> 00:57:05,136
I don't belong to you. I don't
belong to you or anyone else.

632
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,431
And I want my money.
I earned it.

633
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:09,965
You have no right
to keep it from us.

634
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:12,010
I'm not keeping it for
myself. I'm saving it for you.

635
00:57:12,034 --> 00:57:13,612
Where is it? Why don't
you show it to me?

636
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:15,571
You must think. You
must think I'm very stupid.

637
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:17,973
Oh! I've got to get
my mind right.

638
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:19,875
All I want is my money.

639
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,653
I'm all through with you
and I want my money.

640
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:23,731
Shut up and go to bed.

641
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:46,935
Frank.

642
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:49,137
Yes.

643
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:58,100
I'm sorry.

644
00:57:59,715 --> 00:58:01,850
I'm really not much good Frank.

645
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:05,120
But if you want me

646
00:58:06,655 --> 00:58:08,924
I'll try to be a decent wife.

647
00:58:08,957 --> 00:58:12,027
And the U.S.

648
00:58:12,995 --> 00:58:15,030
and that is where
you want to farm

649
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:17,432
or anywhere else.

650
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:23,005
Then it might just
as well be here.

651
00:58:25,974 --> 00:58:28,577
I guess that's what comes
with being a bachelor so long

652
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:31,013
I've done everything myself.

653
00:58:31,046 --> 00:58:32,915
My own way.

654
00:58:33,616 --> 00:58:35,851
Sometimes I forget that

655
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:39,154
I'm not alone anymore.

656
00:58:40,823 --> 00:58:43,726
I'll try to be a good
husband for you Willie.

657
00:59:02,044 --> 00:59:03,946
- Ready?
- Sure. Come on.

658
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:07,215
When will the pictures be
published?

659
00:59:07,249 --> 00:59:10,052
Maybe never. I haven't got an
order for the assignment yet

660
00:59:10,085 --> 00:59:11,887
but the, I think
they'll like them.

661
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,757
Uh, especially if you'll
uh open the cape a little.

662
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:21,229
Ooh. I hope this shows
up in the picture.

663
00:59:21,263 --> 00:59:23,699
Frank gave it to me today.

664
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:24,967
Real diamonds.

665
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,635
Beautiful.

666
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:29,246
Any special occasion?
A birthday or something?

667
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,175
No. No birthday.

668
00:59:32,857 --> 00:59:35,243
But uh, a very special occasion.

669
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:42,217
Nolan my assistant and I will be
popping up all over the place.

670
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,052
But it will all be this
flash stuff so just

671
00:59:44,086 --> 00:59:46,889
play like we're not alive. OK?
- Bye.

672
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,124
Ladies and gentlemen.

673
00:59:49,157 --> 00:59:52,661
The biggest act of the show.

674
00:59:52,695 --> 00:59:55,030
We present The Great Collonis!

675
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:59,802
I hope that didn't disrupt you.
- No. Not at all Bill.

676
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:43,145
Aaaaah!!!

677
01:00:46,081 --> 01:00:48,216
Stand back! Give us
room will you please.

678
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,154
No don't look.

679
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:31,727
Please.

680
01:01:50,713 --> 01:01:53,448
- Is there, anything else?
- No, no, no.

681
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:55,761
Thank you very much.
You've been very nice.

682
01:01:55,922 --> 01:01:58,424
I wish there were something I
could really do for you. I mean.

683
01:01:58,854 --> 01:02:00,122
Really do.

684
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:03,992
I think all I need now
is a little rest.

685
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:23,912
It was a real nice
funeral Willie.

686
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,882
Nobody could ask for any better.

687
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,319
Yes. I'm sure Frank would have
thought it was a lovely funeral.

688
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,222
You get some rest.

689
01:02:35,123 --> 01:02:37,025
You'll feel better in
2 or 3 days.

690
01:02:38,511 --> 01:02:39,795
Charlie.

691
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:44,066
Why did everyone act so
strange at the funeral?

692
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:46,735
No one came near me.

693
01:02:46,915 --> 01:02:48,449
On one spoke to me.

694
01:02:48,937 --> 01:02:50,505
It's been that way
ever since he died.

695
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,174
Why worry about them.

696
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:54,242
They're nothing but a bunch
of characters anyway.

697
01:02:54,614 --> 01:02:57,212
It's as if they think
I killed him.

698
01:02:57,245 --> 01:02:58,456
Oh. You ought to know
better than that.

699
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,883
Gab, gab, gab.
That's all they ever do.

700
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:04,086
There was an investigation. It
was an accident and that's that.

701
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:05,797
Besides if they didn't
have this to talk about

702
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:07,222
they'd find something else.

703
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:08,456
It's possible.

704
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:10,747
Uh Willie.

705
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:13,720
I've got a little business I'd
like to talk over with you.

706
01:03:15,368 --> 01:03:16,731
Frank's will.

707
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:19,001
He made it out the
day after the wedding.

708
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,270
You get everything Willie.

709
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:25,307
I think it's a little more
than you'd expect.

710
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:28,410
Five thousand dollars
cash money.

711
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:32,380
- Five thousand?
- Been saving for years

712
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:34,049
for that little farm.

713
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:38,987
Says you'll find it in the top
of the trunk back of the mirror.

714
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:41,790
Cause I'm sorta responsible.

715
01:03:41,824 --> 01:03:43,704
I'd like to have you look
to see it's all there.

716
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:47,129
-Yeah?
- Alright.

717
01:04:00,658 --> 01:04:03,327
Think we better count it
and see if it checks out?

718
01:04:03,545 --> 01:04:04,880
No.

719
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,183
Frank said there was
5 thousand dollars.

720
01:04:08,216 --> 01:04:10,418
That's what there is.

721
01:04:13,247 --> 01:04:16,150
My whole life I dreamed of
having money.

722
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:19,294
I was much more modest
in my dreams.

723
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:21,922
Five thousand Marks
was all I wanted.

724
01:04:23,331 --> 01:04:26,068
Now I have 5 thousand dollars.

725
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:29,471
And I don't want it.

726
01:04:34,109 --> 01:04:36,544
Of course you don't.
I understand honey.

727
01:04:37,412 --> 01:04:39,114
But Frank wanted
you to be happy.

728
01:04:39,147 --> 01:04:40,015
Why don't you look
at it that way.

729
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:42,885
Charlie. I really have
to get some rest.

730
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:46,521
I'll go.

731
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,538
These pictures will
sell a lot of tickets.

732
01:05:19,955 --> 01:05:21,924
I'll show 'em to the gang.

733
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:25,928
Poor Frank.

734
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:30,518
Even when he's dead he
makes money for Charlie.

735
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:33,001
Made money for me too.

736
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,627
I got an awful big check
for that layout Willie.

737
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:38,941
You see. People
like those pictures.

738
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:42,945
They dramatize death. Gives them
a thrill even in the photograph

739
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:44,246
to see Frank falling.

740
01:05:45,347 --> 01:05:47,082
Ah perhaps.

741
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:48,616
Do you know why
they'll come now?

742
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:51,019
Cause they'll be
waiting for you to fall.

743
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:53,088
They'll want to be sure not
to miss it when you do.

744
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:56,424
Did it ever occur to you Bill
that people might

745
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:58,560
like to see diving just
because they like diving?

746
01:05:58,593 --> 01:06:01,263
Not a dive like you make They're
waiting for you to make a slip.

747
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:03,265
They want to see you dead.

748
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:05,033
I want to see you alive.

749
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,275
Tell me about Frank and you.

750
01:06:13,722 --> 01:06:15,491
Not much to tell.

751
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:19,634
We met. Fell in love.

752
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:21,908
Just like that.

753
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:24,903
Then we weren't alone anymore.

754
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:27,589
We did everything
together because

755
01:06:27,622 --> 01:06:30,392
we couldn't stand
to be separated

756
01:06:30,425 --> 01:06:32,060
even for a single minute.

757
01:06:33,324 --> 01:06:35,660
That's why we became partners.

758
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:39,475
We were very happy.

759
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:41,664
Well at least he had that.

760
01:06:44,206 --> 01:06:45,640
No.

761
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,443
He hadn't

762
01:06:49,644 --> 01:06:51,579
I'll tell you what he had.

763
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:53,681
Really had.

764
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,483
He picked me up
out of the cook tent.

765
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:57,319
He taught me how
to earn a living.

766
01:06:57,352 --> 01:06:59,187
He made a performer out of me.

767
01:06:59,221 --> 01:07:01,356
He loved me and he married me.

768
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:05,007
By way of thanks I betrayed him.

769
01:07:08,396 --> 01:07:10,565
I broke his heart.

770
01:07:10,598 --> 01:07:12,967
And in one way or another

771
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:15,437
I killed him.

772
01:07:18,373 --> 01:07:22,110
Did you love this other guy?
This heal?

773
01:07:26,181 --> 01:07:29,317
- Will you take me home please?
- Sure.

774
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:40,128
No please.
Don't get out.

775
01:07:40,162 --> 01:07:42,397
I feel like being alone.

776
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,890
Thank you so much.

777
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:53,129
Goodnight.

778
01:08:15,697 --> 01:08:17,099
Hello Willie.

779
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:20,702
I uh.

780
01:08:21,603 --> 01:08:24,038
I didn't want to come
around any earlier.

781
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:27,462
I was real sorry to
hear about Frank.

782
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:29,177
Were you?

783
01:08:30,178 --> 01:08:31,613
Of course.

784
01:08:31,646 --> 01:08:33,181
I mean like

785
01:08:34,316 --> 01:08:36,318
somebody we know.

786
01:08:37,285 --> 01:08:39,220
I heard you were
terrific your first dive.

787
01:08:39,313 --> 01:08:40,981
After it happened.

788
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:42,582
I had a good teacher.

789
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:45,193
Yeah.

790
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,804
How's Peggy?

791
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:50,098
Peggy? Uh

792
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,700
She left.

793
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:54,202
I don't know.

794
01:08:58,173 --> 01:09:00,708
Well I, I guess
I better be going.

795
01:09:01,147 --> 01:09:02,458
Where are you going?

796
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:05,219
Haven't made up my mind yet.

797
01:09:05,246 --> 01:09:06,614
Doesn't much matter.

798
01:09:07,697 --> 01:09:09,365
If you wanted it I,

799
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,396
I think I could get Charlie
to give your old job back.

800
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:16,858
No baby.

801
01:09:17,459 --> 01:09:19,461
You're doing alright
now and I want you to

802
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,235
I'm no good for you.

803
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:34,309
Joe.

804
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:06,234
Harry.

805
01:11:06,268 --> 01:11:07,469
Hi Willie.

806
01:11:07,502 --> 01:11:09,547
Will you get Charlie to come to
my tent as soon as he can?

807
01:11:09,571 --> 01:11:11,439
- And it's very important.
- Sure.

808
01:11:11,473 --> 01:11:13,275
- Right away.
- Thanks.

809
01:11:37,244 --> 01:11:39,046
Wanna see me?

810
01:11:39,334 --> 01:11:40,334
Sit down.

811
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:46,494
There's uh something
we haven't talked about.

812
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:47,975
Yeah?

813
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:50,645
What's that?

814
01:11:53,615 --> 01:11:55,283
My new salary.

815
01:11:55,317 --> 01:11:58,286
You were paying Frank
2 hundred and me 125.

816
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,355
That's 325 for the
whole act right?

817
01:12:00,388 --> 01:12:01,289
Yeah well you see I..

818
01:12:01,323 --> 01:12:03,825
From now on the act
only costs you 300.

819
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:07,212
I was thinking around 200 and
then maybe a little later...

820
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:10,307
It's 300 Charlie
or I don't go on.

821
01:12:10,418 --> 01:12:11,986
And I'm not joking.

822
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:15,473
No, I don't believe you are.

823
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:18,573
Then it's settled?

824
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:23,044
Yeah.

825
01:12:24,346 --> 01:12:25,647
By the way.

826
01:12:26,348 --> 01:12:28,650
You haven't seen Joe around
this morning have you?

827
01:12:28,683 --> 01:12:30,918
Joe? No why?

828
01:12:30,952 --> 01:12:32,854
I didn't even know he was back.

829
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,389
He was.

830
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:42,419
Is there anything wrong Willie?

831
01:12:42,582 --> 01:12:44,375
Not a thing. Why?

832
01:12:44,499 --> 01:12:45,600
I was just wondering

833
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:48,736
the way you held me up for
that 300 dollars just now.

834
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,805
That wasn't like you Willie.

835
01:12:51,489 --> 01:12:53,892
It's going to be like
me from now on.

836
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:56,674
I'm turning smart.

837
01:12:56,853 --> 01:12:58,622
Very smart.

838
01:12:59,781 --> 01:13:01,949
You don't have to convince me.

839
01:13:13,395 --> 01:13:16,464
The Great Colloni.

840
01:13:29,977 --> 01:13:32,414
You can tell them tonight
that I'll dive like Frank did.

841
01:13:32,447 --> 01:13:33,615
I'll do the summersault dive.

842
01:13:33,648 --> 01:13:35,759
Gee that's great kid but do
you know what you're doing?

843
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:38,386
Improving the act Charlie.
That's what I'm doing.

844
01:13:38,757 --> 01:13:40,601
And after the dive
you come to my tent

845
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:43,758
and we'll talk about money.
More money to be exact.

846
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:55,870
MS. Colloni tonight will
attempt a summersault dive.

847
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:00,128
(speaking German)

848
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:57,431
Aaah!

849
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:03,471
Come here will you?

850
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:09,844
Willie! Come on Willie.

851
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:13,180
Ok. Ok. Take her arm.

852
01:15:22,824 --> 01:15:24,792
The doctor says
you're going to be great.

853
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:28,129
It'll take a little while but
your going to be alright.

854
01:16:52,379 --> 01:16:54,348
How did you get that
scar on your cheek?

855
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,543
Oh that that. I got a
nick during the war.

856
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:00,287
I was a photographer
at that headquarters

857
01:17:00,321 --> 01:17:03,190
I was snapping a
photograph of some VIP

858
01:17:03,224 --> 01:17:05,993
75 miles behind the
front one day when a

859
01:17:06,027 --> 01:17:08,162
flashbulb exploded in my face.

860
01:17:08,195 --> 01:17:10,998
I always felt they should have
given me the purple heart for it

861
01:17:12,645 --> 01:17:14,313
I like it.

862
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,667
Gives you sort of a sporty look

863
01:17:41,829 --> 01:17:43,597
You like?

864
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:47,101
I like very much.

865
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,238
Willie. I want to
ask you a question.

866
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:53,841
That's why I brought
you here. It's a very

867
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:56,143
- important question and I..
- Bill I, I can't.

868
01:17:57,044 --> 01:17:58,713
I just can't.

869
01:17:58,746 --> 01:18:00,982
I might even want
to but I can't.

870
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:03,818
You're throwing away
an awful lot of years

871
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,953
that might be good for us both.

872
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,621
I know.

873
01:18:08,255 --> 01:18:10,892
I'll probably be sorry
for the rest of my life.

874
01:18:11,425 --> 01:18:14,048
I've never brought good
fortune to anybody.

875
01:18:14,228 --> 01:18:16,130
Least of all to myself.

876
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:20,267
Are you sure it isn't Joe?

877
01:18:22,236 --> 01:18:23,905
Do you still love him?

878
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:26,173
I don't know what love is.

879
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,353
I think you love me.

880
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:10,284
Stop, with all those
people watching

881
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:15,823
Excuse me but you have a
phone call from Frankfurt.

882
01:19:16,257 --> 01:19:18,860
Thank you.
I'll be right back.

883
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,929
Uhm. How much.

884
01:19:21,963 --> 01:19:23,464
5 Marks.

885
01:19:28,803 --> 01:19:30,437
Yes who's calling?

886
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:32,495
Charlie.

887
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,903
Oh how are things going?

888
01:19:35,276 --> 01:19:36,978
Ah not so good Willie.

889
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:39,246
I thought we'd do better
here in Frankfurt.

890
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,348
The most important thing
is how are you?

891
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:43,450
I'm fine. The doctors
say they're going

892
01:19:43,484 --> 01:19:45,319
to throw me out of
here the end of the week.

893
01:19:45,352 --> 01:19:47,755
She's getting out
of here alright

894
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:49,323
but she's not coming
to Frankfurt.

895
01:19:49,356 --> 01:19:50,825
She quit see, she's through.

896
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:52,193
You can take that diving tower

897
01:19:52,226 --> 01:19:54,962
and you can sell it
to junk dealers.

898
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:57,331
But to tell you the
truth Charlie

899
01:19:57,364 --> 01:19:59,801
I probably won't be coming back.

900
01:19:59,834 --> 01:20:02,236
I think I have other plans.

901
01:20:02,269 --> 01:20:04,138
Nice plans.

902
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:06,407
Uh. Just a minute.

903
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,209
There's somebody here
wants to talk to you.

904
01:20:10,311 --> 01:20:11,979
Just a minute.

905
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,188
Hi ya Willie.

906
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:25,192
Yes.

907
01:20:26,527 --> 01:20:28,095
Yes I'm much better.

908
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:32,266
Thank you.

909
01:20:32,934 --> 01:20:34,368
Thank you very much.

910
01:20:36,137 --> 01:20:37,538
Goodbye.

911
01:20:44,378 --> 01:20:46,347
Your attention please.

912
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,817
The passengers of flight 418

913
01:20:49,851 --> 01:20:53,855
from Munich to Frankfurt will
enter through gate number 2.

914
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:06,200
- Willie.
- Willie.

915
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:09,871
- Willie. Hello.
- I'm glad to see you.

916
01:21:11,138 --> 01:21:12,615
How do you feel Willie?
How do you feel?

917
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,175
Ah I knew you'd come back.

918
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,243
This show is really
nothing without you.

919
01:21:16,477 --> 01:21:19,113
Come on.
I'll show you your tent.

920
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,049
Where's Joe?

921
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:24,251
Oh he's in town trying to
drum up some business.

922
01:21:49,643 --> 01:21:51,178
For me?

923
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:05,359
Oh Groppo.

924
01:22:06,327 --> 01:22:08,930
We're very much alike you and I.

925
01:22:09,563 --> 01:22:12,466
We have good things in us.

926
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,636
Lots of good things.

927
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:19,240
They're trapped there.

928
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:23,978
They can't come out.

929
01:22:29,016 --> 01:22:30,484
Thank you.

930
01:23:10,714 --> 01:23:12,583
Hi Willie.

931
01:23:13,913 --> 01:23:15,715
Hello Joe.

932
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:17,431
I uh.

933
01:23:19,033 --> 01:23:20,234
Oh yeah.

934
01:23:22,684 --> 01:23:27,356
I uh guess I've got a
little explaining to do.

935
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:30,677
No. Everything's alright Joe.

936
01:23:30,974 --> 01:23:33,377
Let's just forget it.

937
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:45,459
Willie.

938
01:23:45,492 --> 01:23:46,593
Uh.

939
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:49,496
Willie I, I don't
want to forget it.

940
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:51,232
I want to talk to you.

941
01:23:51,265 --> 01:23:53,534
Could I come back to
your tent after the show?

942
01:23:54,035 --> 01:23:56,470
Sure Joe. I'd like to see you.

943
01:23:56,503 --> 01:23:59,573
Ladies and gentlemen.
The star of our show.

944
01:23:59,606 --> 01:24:03,110
The great Colloni.

945
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:32,826
Willie.

946
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:36,163
Why did you have to follow me?

947
01:26:36,197 --> 01:26:38,565
If I were right for you I
would have come back.

948
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:41,668
Joe's here. Did you come
to Frankfurt to see him?

949
01:26:41,702 --> 01:26:43,404
Yes. Yes I did.

950
01:26:43,437 --> 01:26:45,439
Please believe me.
I'm not running after you.

951
01:26:45,472 --> 01:26:47,241
I just want to be around
if you need me.

952
01:26:47,274 --> 01:26:50,244
Look. I have to
be alone now Bill.

953
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:52,779
Don't follow me please.

954
01:27:02,031 --> 01:27:04,734
You were terrific.
You're great.

955
01:27:05,259 --> 01:27:07,228
That took a lot of guts.

956
01:27:07,261 --> 01:27:09,930
I couldn't have done that.
I mean go back up there

957
01:27:09,963 --> 01:27:11,765
after what happened.

958
01:27:11,997 --> 01:27:13,534
Thank you.

959
01:27:13,644 --> 01:27:16,347
Uh. Willie.

960
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:20,574
I know what I did was a,
was a real lousy thing to do

961
01:27:20,607 --> 01:27:22,709
and I'm sorry.

962
01:27:23,477 --> 01:27:27,448
The only thing I can say is I
want to make it up to you.

963
01:27:27,481 --> 01:27:30,551
You want to give me
back the money?

964
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:33,220
Why sure baby. Sure.

965
01:27:33,254 --> 01:27:34,921
But I want to do more than that.

966
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:37,824
Look. Without you this show
wouldn't be worth a penny.

967
01:27:37,858 --> 01:27:40,827
You know that. And what's
Charlie paying you? Peanuts.

968
01:27:42,396 --> 01:27:44,398
I can show you how to
make some real doe.

969
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:46,333
You know what you
should be getting?

970
01:27:46,367 --> 01:27:49,436
A piece of this outfit.
And I mean a big piece.

971
01:27:50,075 --> 01:27:52,443
And I'm going to see
that you get it.

972
01:27:53,094 --> 01:27:55,497
That will be fine Joe.

973
01:27:57,444 --> 01:27:59,246
Is that all you're
interested in?

974
01:27:59,546 --> 01:28:01,348
Baby.

975
01:28:02,516 --> 01:28:04,651
You know better than that.

976
01:28:13,394 --> 01:28:15,662
It doesn't work Joe.

977
01:28:15,696 --> 01:28:17,698
It doesn't work anymore.

978
01:28:17,731 --> 01:28:18,908
What's the matter with you?
You nuts?

979
01:28:18,932 --> 01:28:20,734
What are you talking about.

980
01:28:21,068 --> 01:28:22,870
I'm free of you.

981
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:26,026
I didn't think I ever would be.

982
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,919
But I am.

983
01:28:27,944 --> 01:28:31,312
Look baby. I don't blame you
for being sore about the money.

984
01:28:31,345 --> 01:28:33,514
The money.
No Joe.

985
01:28:34,014 --> 01:28:37,584
I'm only sorry it couldn't have
been put to some decent use.

986
01:28:37,618 --> 01:28:41,054
Instead of being carried off to
the sewers by filth like you.

987
01:28:41,087 --> 01:28:43,524
Now just a minute. Just hold it.

988
01:28:43,557 --> 01:28:45,692
You can be sore.

989
01:28:45,726 --> 01:28:48,061
But you or no other dame is
going to talk to me like that.

990
01:28:48,094 --> 01:28:50,431
Now let's stop this nonsense.

991
01:28:51,097 --> 01:28:52,899
Come here.

992
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:54,701
I won't.

993
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:57,926
- You'll do as I tell you to do.
- Not anymore Joe.

994
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:00,341
That's all over.

995
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:04,878
If you were starving to death
and howling for food

996
01:29:04,911 --> 01:29:07,781
I wouldn't throw
you a rotten bone.

997
01:29:08,715 --> 01:29:09,783
Ah!

998
01:29:16,557 --> 01:29:17,691
Now.

999
01:29:18,825 --> 01:29:20,537
I know what you're trying
to prove but knock it off.

1000
01:29:20,561 --> 01:29:21,728
It won't work.

1001
01:29:22,696 --> 01:29:25,866
You're stuck with me
baby and you know it.

1002
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:29,536
Whatever I am. We're
both made of the same stuff.

1003
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,837
We are not!

1004
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:33,340
I'm not dirty like you.

1005
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,709
When I saw your money
I was hungry.

1006
01:29:35,742 --> 01:29:38,512
Whatever I've done
wrong shames me.

1007
01:29:38,979 --> 01:29:40,614
But you

1008
01:29:40,647 --> 01:29:43,517
You love to wallow in the mud.

1009
01:29:44,918 --> 01:29:46,953
You've been paid in full.

1010
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:49,089
Now get out of here.

1011
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:51,725
Get out of here?

1012
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:53,994
Get out.

1013
01:29:54,749 --> 01:29:57,785
You could stand just like that
and tell me to get out?

1014
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,631
You think after what I did

1015
01:30:02,378 --> 01:30:04,580
Do you think I fixed that
bar on Franks ladder

1016
01:30:04,605 --> 01:30:06,807
for you to tell me to
get out of here?

1017
01:30:06,836 --> 01:30:09,038
Yeah. I did that.

1018
01:30:09,992 --> 01:30:12,595
I did it because I couldn't
stand to be without you.

1019
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:15,055
I did it for us.
Because we belong together.

1020
01:30:16,082 --> 01:30:18,685
- You killed Frank?
- No. No. Not me.

1021
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:21,221
We did it. The two of us.
The both of us.

1022
01:30:22,648 --> 01:30:25,584
Yeah.
That's what everybody will think.

1023
01:30:26,874 --> 01:30:29,910
Yeah. And I'll
let them think it.

1024
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:32,566
Yeah.

1025
01:30:32,866 --> 01:30:34,535
Now.

1026
01:30:34,568 --> 01:30:37,504
Now tell me to get out of here.

1027
01:30:37,538 --> 01:30:38,739
Get Out!!

1028
01:30:39,072 --> 01:30:40,941
Ah. Uh.

1029
01:32:26,179 --> 01:32:28,248
Groppo!

1030
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:34,788
Groppo. No! No! Come down!

1031
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:42,763
No! No! Don't Shoot.

1032
01:32:45,298 --> 01:32:47,534
Come down Groppo.

1033
01:32:49,603 --> 01:32:51,972
They won't hurt you.

1034
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:56,038
Please come down Groppo.

1035
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,942
It's alright Groppo.

1036
01:33:30,143 --> 01:33:32,078
They won't harm you.

1037
01:33:32,879 --> 01:33:34,981
I know you did it for me.

1038
01:33:35,716 --> 01:33:38,084
And I'll tell them so.

1039
01:33:38,685 --> 01:33:40,943
You must go with them now.

1040
01:33:41,254 --> 01:33:44,625
No. He will not need those.

1041
01:33:46,862 --> 01:33:49,029
He will go with you now.

1042
01:34:07,116 --> 01:34:08,989
Poor Groppo.
