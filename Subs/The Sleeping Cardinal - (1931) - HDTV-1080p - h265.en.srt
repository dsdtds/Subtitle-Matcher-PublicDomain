1
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:40,829
Hello.

2
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:42,956
Who's here?

3
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:40,032
That's yours, Colonel.

4
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,950
Thank you.

5
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,660
I can fix you another whiskey?

6
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:43,619
Thank you.

7
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:44,846
You can get me one, Kathleen.

8
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,039
Then come and sit me by
me to change my luck.

9
00:03:47,123 --> 00:03:48,040
Oh, stop talking,

10
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,267
I'm trying to play this hand.

11
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,627
The sort of hands you
hold play themselves.

12
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:53,838
Eh, Colonel Henslowe?

13
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,923
Ronnie holds the
most amazing cards.

14
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:58,675
The rest are mine.

15
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,803
I suppose because I'm
your brother, Kathleen,

16
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:01,887
I can't have a drink.

17
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:03,639
That's right, four spades.

18
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:11,856
Dr. Watson is here, Miss.

19
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:14,024
He says he won't
disturb the bridge.

20
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:15,484
Thank you, Marston.

21
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,069
Tell him I'll be
with him in a moment.

22
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:18,153
Thank you, Miss.

23
00:04:27,997 --> 00:04:29,165
Now what about all of...

24
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:31,667
Four in one hand and
one in the dummy.

25
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:32,960
That's 8I.

26
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:34,294
Excuse me, sir.

27
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,838
This was on the floor.

28
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:37,589
Thanks.

29
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,474
Ah, thank you.

30
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,351
My deal, I believe.

31
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,937
Will you cut, Colonel?

32
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:53,206
Come and sit by me, Kathleen.

33
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,774
I can't leave
Dr. Watson alone.

34
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,399
I must go.

35
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,693
Is that the Dr. Watson,

36
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,445
the friend of Sherlock Holmes?

37
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,528
Yes.

38
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,947
Then you know Holmes?

39
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:04,992
No, Dr. Watson has known him
since Ronnie and I were Kids,

40
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,077
but we've never met Mr. Holmes.

41
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,537
He's always too busy.

42
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,831
I say, I've
got two aces of spades.

43
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:15,419
But we've
used this pack before.

44
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:19,423
Oh, I know, Marston
found one on the floor.

45
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:22,611
Yes, but how could...

46
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,512
Yes, and it must've
dropped off here.

47
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:44,907
Your cut,
please, Colonel.

48
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:46,825
Cut for me, Ronnie.

49
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:49,578
Well...

50
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:50,663
Don't go, Kathleen.

51
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:53,249
I'll come and say goodnight
to you all before I go to bed.

52
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:55,334
I expect you'll all
be at it till three.

53
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,293
No, don't get up.

54
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:58,837
I hope you all win.

55
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:09,849
My dear, how kind
of you to come.

56
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,934
A summons from
you comes before

57
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:14,019
even a summons from
Sherlock Holmes.

58
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,105
It's sweet of you
to say so anyhow.

59
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,362
Take off your coat and
let me give you a drink.

60
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,567
No, thanks, I can't stay.

61
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,862
I came for a moment
because you sent for me.

62
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,365
Well, let's sit
down for a minute.

63
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,463
Has Ronnie got
another bilious attack?

64
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:42,756
No, it's nothing really.

65
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:45,967
I'm a bit worried.

66
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:47,302
Kathleen, dear.

67
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:48,762
Won't you confide in me?

68
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
It's about Ronnie.

69
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:52,432
This gambling.

70
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,536
You know, six months ago
we hadn't a shilling.

71
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,438
You mean when your trustee
absconded and shot himself.

72
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:59,189
Yes, we were
going to leave here.

73
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:02,359
Ronnie was going to give
up the diplomatic service,

74
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:05,070
and then he began to play
bridge for high stakes.

75
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,573
But I always understood

76
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:08,976
he was an exceedingly
fine player.

77
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:10,576
He is, but you
can't always win.

78
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:14,287
What do you mean?

79
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:16,497
Always.

80
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:17,958
Sometimes it's 20 pounds.

81
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,543
Sometimes 500.

82
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:21,754
But he never loses.

83
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:24,672
It looks as if...

84
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:26,591
Oh, I can't say it.

85
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:28,886
It's impossible.

86
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,930
Ronnie isn't capable
of such a thing,

87
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:32,514
but I would like to be sure.

88
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,475
How can one make sure?

89
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,018
Well, I really don't know.

90
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,771
I'll ask Holmes.

91
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,397
Oh, no, he might
arrest Ronnie.

92
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,941
No, of course he wouldn't,

93
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,778
but he might frighten
him into giving up cards.

94
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:47,905
I never thought of that.

95
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,282
Yes, do ask him to do something.

96
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:53,661
I'll come around and see
him in the morning, may I?

97
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,370
Well, I don't know.

98
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:56,455
Yes, I may.

99
00:07:56,622 --> 00:07:58,248
You'll make him
see me, won't you?

100
00:07:58,707 --> 00:08:00,250
He thinks an awful lot of you.

101
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,963
Well, I don't think I need
waste time. It's a grand slam.

102
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,298
I make seven of
spades, three diamonds,

103
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,217
two of hearts, and
the ace of clubs.

104
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,093
That's right.

105
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,178
Another big rubber.

106
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,138
Well, that just
about cleans me out.

107
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,599
I make the
difference 1600 points.

108
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,143
You add up very quickly.

109
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,229
Quite a mathematician, eh?

110
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,230
How much is that?

111
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,190
160 pounds.

112
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:26,068
Well, I've lost both rubbers,

113
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:28,570
and so I owe you 255 pounds.

114
00:08:29,905 --> 00:08:31,323
But we settle up at the end.

115
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:34,993
This is the end.

116
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,041
My wife is not very well,

117
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,877
and I promised to go home early.

118
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:46,797
Well, if you must, you must.

119
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,632
I'm sorry to
spoil your evening,

120
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:51,468
but perhaps you can get Miss
Adair to make up a four.

121
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:54,013
Kathleen plays a game
that resembles hockey

122
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:55,096
more than bridge.

123
00:08:55,514 --> 00:08:56,634
Still, if you're determined,

124
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:57,725
we'll see you Monday.

125
00:08:57,808 --> 00:08:59,143
I'm afraid I shan't be able.

126
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:01,603
I have to go out of town
on important business,

127
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,123
and I don't know
when I shall be back.

128
00:09:03,147 --> 00:09:05,649
Then it's no use trying
to fix another evening.

129
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,650
I'm afraid not.

130
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,320
Let me know when you're back.

131
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:11,946
Goodnight,

132
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:14,324
and thanks very much.

133
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,618
I didn't know Sir
Timothy played bridge.

134
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:18,328
Sir Timothy?

135
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:19,705
Yes, Timothy Frobisher.

136
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:21,165
He's the fourth.

137
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:23,917
You know, one can't work
long with Sherlock Holmes

138
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,170
without picking
some of his tricks

139
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,755
of observation and deduction.

140
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,465
What makes you
think he's here?

141
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:30,548
His initials.

142
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:31,884
T.F., Timothy Frobisher.

143
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,054
Elementary, My Dear Kathleen.

144
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:36,305
Elementary,

145
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,390
and then there are
further indications.

146
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,642
The owner of this hat
is immensely tall.

147
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:43,604
You see, he's bruised
the top edge here.

148
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,856
Probably going through a door.

149
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,357
Excuse me, may I have my hat?

150
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,650
Yours?

151
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:50,777
Certainly.

152
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:52,154
My initials are inside.

153
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:53,696
T.F., Thomas Fisher.

154
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:56,408
Oh, I beg your pardon.

155
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:57,993
You're not going?

156
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,220
Yes, my wife is not very well,

157
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:00,996
and I promised to
get home early.

158
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:02,705
Oh, I am sorry.

159
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:03,956
I think I'll go too.

160
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,879
Well, goodnight,

161
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,465
and thanks for playing.

162
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:13,217
Sorry you had
such rotten luck.

163
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:14,717
See you Monday.

164
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:16,970
Well, really I
think I better not.

165
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:18,889
I've lost an awful lot lately,

166
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,974
and I think I better
chuck it for a bit.

167
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:22,559
Guess you're right.

168
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:23,727
Oh, don't think me rude,

169
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:25,145
but I just can't afford it.

170
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:26,521
That's all right.

171
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:29,233
Goodnight, Colonel.

172
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,484
Goodnight.

173
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,659
Well, have you a sick wife

174
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,327
and a business appointment?

175
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,578
No, a whiskey and soda.

176
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,123
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,167
Still it is rather rotten.

178
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,584
I don't see why.

179
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:50,838
Fisher being a millionaire,

180
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:52,464
naturally loses his temper

181
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,383
when he loses sixpence,

182
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,552
and Tony Rutherford is broke.

183
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,345
And you think that's all?

184
00:10:58,428 --> 00:10:59,179
What else?

185
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,347
Oh, nothing, of course.

186
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,182
You can always
get another four.

187
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,601
Then you'll continue to come?

188
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,270
With pleasure.

189
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:09,606
I'm not afraid of
losing sixpence,

190
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,985
and I'm lucky, I
often cut with you.

191
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,077
What's the matter
with you all?

192
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,162
Stopping so early.

193
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:24,955
Well, Fisher had to go,

194
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:26,832
and for once in my life,

195
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,584
I'm going to have
an early night.

196
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:30,669
Then I'll see you out.

197
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:32,272
Goodnight, Ronnie.

198
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:33,380
Goodnight, Colonel.

199
00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:09,017
Ronnie, you've got
to tell me the truth.

200
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,646
The truth, what do you mean?

201
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,148
I've got to find
out the truth!

202
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,151
A terribly difficult
thing, darling.

203
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:20,403
Ronnie, stop it.

204
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:22,906
Kindly explain
the ace of spades.

205
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,201
Explain
the ace of spades?

206
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,453
You know exactly what I mean.

207
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:30,664
When Marston picked it up,

208
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:32,749
you said it belonged
to that pack.

209
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,543
It doesn't, and you know it.

210
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,630
Well, it must belong
to some other pack.

211
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:40,382
A hidden duplicate pack.

212
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:43,635
What the devil do you mean?

213
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:46,155
How dare you suggest that I...

214
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:48,056
God knows I don't
want to suggest it.

215
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:49,933
But we were ruined.

216
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:52,352
Then you started playing
bridge for high stakes.

217
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:53,353
Look here, Kathleen.

218
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,272
We've always been
the best of pals,

219
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:56,958
but if you're going to
say things like that...

220
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,984
Don't you see
everything points to it?

221
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,028
Oh, I don't believe it.

222
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:02,528
I won't believe it.

223
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:06,575
If I did, I'd rather put
a bullet through your head

224
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,243
than own a brother who...

225
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:09,077
Yes, Marston?

226
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,580
Excuse me, sir, a note
from the Foreign Office.

227
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:15,624
Thanks.

228
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:16,752
Who brought it?

229
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,045
The commissioner, sir.

230
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,046
Is he there?

231
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,964
No, sir, he said
there'd be no answer.

232
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,631
Thanks.

233
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,968
Shall you want
anything else, sir?

234
00:14:25,552 --> 00:14:26,720
Not tonight, Marston.

235
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,764
I shall want breakfast
a bit earlier.

236
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:29,991
The Foreign Office is sending

237
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:31,433
a car for me at half past nine.

238
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,516
Very good, sir.

239
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:33,976
Goodnight, Miss.

240
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:35,103
Goodnight, Marston.

241
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:36,187
Goodnight, sir.

242
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:37,355
Goodnight.

243
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,526
Anything serious?

244
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,988
Well, if you must know,
they want me to go and see

245
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:46,656
some German fellow in Hampstead

246
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,180
who will tell me
some official secret

247
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:51,078
which was probably published
in last night's paper.

248
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:52,746
Don't go, Ronnie.

249
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:54,456
I've got to have
this out of you.

250
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:55,831
I can't believe...

251
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,168
Ronnie.

252
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:09,197
What shall I do with
Mr. Holmes's breakfast?

253
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:11,533
Isn't he up yet?

254
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:12,534
Ain't no sign of him.

255
00:16:12,617 --> 00:16:14,578
Hasn't even took in
his shaving water.

256
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,205
I do wish he'd be a bit
more regular in his habits.

257
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:20,542
Meals at all times of the day
does turn a house upside down.

258
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,377
But you know, Mrs. Hudson,

259
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:25,005
you always insist on
keeping his meals for him.

260
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:26,840
He never asks.

261
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,925
Yes, but the poor
man must eat sometime.

262
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:31,428
If I didn't see that he
had a bite now and again,

263
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:34,055
he'd have been in
his grave years ago.

264
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,224
I should go and
bang on his door.

265
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:37,392
Yes, sir,

266
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,978
but sometimes when he's
thinking out his problems,

267
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:41,897
he gets cross when
he's disturbed.

268
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,065
He won't be this morning.

269
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,818
He's rather good tempered,

270
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,615
and he doesn't
want any breakfast.

271
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,079
Lord, Mr. Holmes,

272
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,415
you did give me a turn.

273
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:03,001
Well, one good turn
deserves another, eh?

274
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,880
- What can I do for you.
- Have some breakfast, sir.

275
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,423
I've already breakfasted

276
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:11,134
with the manager of the
London Commercial Bank.

277
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:12,886
So they've sent
for you for this.

278
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,805
Are you sure I can't tempt
you to a nice bit of haddock?

279
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:18,975
My dear Mrs. Hudson,

280
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:21,061
you've always been
a temptation to me,

281
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,397
but haddock after a
good breakfast is not.

282
00:17:26,441 --> 00:17:27,859
Oh, how you do don't carry on.

283
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,111
It's a good job I
don't take you serious.

284
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,571
I'm perfectly serious.

285
00:17:31,655 --> 00:17:33,281
Jokes are not my strong point.

286
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,533
Ask the doctor.

287
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,285
I never see any of his.

288
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:38,537
No.

289
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,515
You know, I've been
wondering, My Dear Watson,

290
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,416
why you don't get the batteries
of your car recharged.

291
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:44,709
What do you mean?

292
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:45,877
You had great difficulty

293
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,521
in getting your car
to start last night.

294
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:48,630
The batteries are run down.

295
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,257
They are, but
how did you know?

296
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:54,427
You've a blister at
the base of your fingers

297
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,970
on the right hand.

298
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,699
As you've not been standing on
the serpentine this morning,

299
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,142
I deduced that you've
been cranking your car.

300
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,561
That's rather wonderful.

301
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:04,646
But that's elementary,
My Dear Watson.

302
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,440
Elementary. Let me
give you a hand.

303
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:09,276
- Thank you, sir.
- Can you lift that?

304
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,028
And the cloth on
the top like so.

305
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:13,822
- There you are.
- Thank you.

306
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,700
You sure there's nothing
else I can do for you?

307
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,451
No, nothing, thank you.

308
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:19,452
Oh, wait a minute.

309
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:20,704
Let me give you a hand.

310
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,208
Thank you.

311
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,629
Why have they
sent for you about this?

312
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:30,963
It's perfectly simple.

313
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:33,216
A man tries to burgle
a bank, is disturbed,

314
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,552
kills the watchman,
and runs away.

315
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:41,016
I find it very interesting.

316
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,231
Have you ever heard of
Professor Robert Moriarty?

317
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,002
No, what's
he got to do with it?

318
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:53,445
He's to do with half
the crimes the world over.

319
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,741
He started as a
mathematical professor,

320
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:01,494
but ugly rumors gathered
around him and he resigned.

321
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,292
Well after that he vanished
for 10 years or so.

322
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,585
I fancy he went abroad.

323
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,379
Then he returned to England,

324
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:14,174
and things began to happen.

325
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:15,758
What things?

326
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,763
For a long time I've been
conscious of some power,

327
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:25,435
a deep organization which
stands in the way of the law.

328
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:28,438
Once he made a slip,

329
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,482
and I was able to deduce

330
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,567
that behind that
power was Moriarty.

331
00:19:36,196 --> 00:19:37,614
But he recovered himself,

332
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:39,199
and I could prove nothing.

333
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:42,452
He has hundreds of agents,

334
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,287
none of whom have ever seen him.

335
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,665
Sometimes an agent is caught,

336
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,751
but the man who plans
most of the crimes

337
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,795
that are committed
is never caught.

338
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:53,713
Never even suspected.

339
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,133
He knows that I know
of his activities.

340
00:19:58,218 --> 00:19:59,719
He also knows that up to now,

341
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:01,739
I've been unable to reach him.

342
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:04,516
And you think he's connected
with this bank murder?

343
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,727
I think it highly probable.

344
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:12,357
Yes?

345
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:13,400
Yes, come in.

346
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:15,068
Inspector Lestrade
to see you, sir.

347
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,151
Oh, Lestrade.

348
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,861
Anything fresh?

349
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:19,113
No, Mr. Holmes.

350
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:20,240
Sit down, Lestrade.

351
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:21,199
Thank you.

352
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:23,702
I just came in to get
that piece of brown paper.

353
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:25,453
Yes, this little
piece you mean.

354
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:28,331
I should like to keep it
a little longer, if I may.

355
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:31,459
I hadn't yet decided what
the rest of the label is.

356
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:34,254
Well, I don't see
how you ever can.

357
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,426
It's just an ordinary
shopkeeper's label.

358
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,987
There's not enough of
it to tell us anything.

359
00:20:42,011 --> 00:20:43,847
Well, I disagree,
My Dear Lestrade,

360
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,766
but then you and I
so often disagree.

361
00:20:48,643 --> 00:20:49,561
Oh, come, Mr. Holmes.

362
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,730
I have a great respect
for your theories.

363
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,774
It's only when you begin
about this Professor Moriarty.

364
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,401
Yeah, you don't
believe in him.

365
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,111
And I ask you,

366
00:20:58,194 --> 00:20:59,863
is it possible for a man to plan

367
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:02,031
half the crime in this country

368
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,950
without the Yard
knowing who he is,

369
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,035
where he lives, or
anything about him?

370
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,495
It does seem rather strange.

371
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,330
I mean, the man
can't live nowhere.

372
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:10,707
Never be seen by anyone.

373
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,393
Of course. I mean
lots of people know him,

374
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,419
but they don't know
that he's Moriarty.

375
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:17,464
You yourself may know him.

376
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,716
Jokes are not your
strong point, Holmes.

377
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,342
No, I'm perfectly serious.

378
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,927
He has a hundred disguises

379
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:24,554
and a hundred aliases,

380
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,558
and I'm pretty certain he had
a hand in this bank robbery.

381
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,518
But it wasn't a robbery.

382
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,228
The thief got nothing.

383
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:33,688
He broke into the bank.

384
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,441
Have you ever tried to
break into a bank, Lestrade?

385
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:39,109
Me?

386
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:40,277
No, I thought not.

387
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:44,073
But do you seriously
think it's possible

388
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,867
for one man to break into a bank

389
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,745
without using anything
short of dynamite?

390
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:50,830
There we no signs
of a forced entry.

391
00:21:50,955 --> 00:21:52,332
Which might point
to the fact of

392
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,417
his having an
accomplice, or even two.

393
00:21:56,878 --> 00:21:57,629
He got inside.

394
00:21:57,712 --> 00:22:00,340
Which doesn't necessarily
mean your professor.

395
00:22:01,174 --> 00:22:03,259
The man was interrupted
by the watchman,

396
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:05,428
killed him, got
frightened, and bolted.

397
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:07,347
And, yet, inside the safe,

398
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:11,392
we found this piece
of brown paper.

399
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:14,395
Three people swear
it was not there

400
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,147
when the safe was
shut last night.

401
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:18,441
Then he was inside
when he was disturbed.

402
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,068
Or before he went inside.

403
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:23,780
He had this paper
wrapped around something.

404
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:26,950
You will observe that this
end here is slightly torn,

405
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:28,701
and there is a
blood stain on it.

406
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,038
I, therefore, deduce
that the struggle

407
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,082
with the watchman
took place first,

408
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:36,668
and he then took his
parcel into the safe.

409
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:38,253
It won't work, Mr. Holmes.

410
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:41,256
It won't work.

411
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:43,842
There were 70,000 pounds
of notes in the vault.

412
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,886
Not one of them is missing.

413
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,346
How true.

414
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:51,140
How true.

415
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:53,268
But if you remember
a fortnight ago,

416
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,770
an almost similar thing
occurred in Berlin.

417
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:57,521
In Berlin?

418
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:58,772
Yes.

419
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,652
You should read your Berliner
Tageblatt, My Dear Lestrade.

420
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:05,613
There strong room of the
Reichsbank was entered.

421
00:23:05,864 --> 00:23:06,990
The watchman was laid out,

422
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:08,074
happily not killed,

423
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:09,492
and nothing was removed.

424
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:11,244
Very strange, Mr. Holmes.

425
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,329
Very strange indeed.

426
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,124
Looks almost as if
there was a connection.

427
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,710
I should like time to
think it out a bit.

428
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:21,588
When can I have that
piece of brown paper?

429
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,089
I'll let you have
it this evening.

430
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,984
In the meantime, would
you be good enough to warn

431
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:27,051
all foreign customs officials
to be on the lookout

432
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:29,596
for a very large quantity
of English bank notes,

433
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,140
which will be smuggled
through in ordinary luggage.

434
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:33,141
What do you think?

435
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:35,226
I think it would
be a wise precaution.

436
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:36,686
Very good, Mr. Holmes.

437
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:37,913
I'll get back to the Yard now,

438
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:39,355
and put the matter in hand.

439
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:41,190
Good morning, gentlemen.

440
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,900
The chief has arrived, sir.

441
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,159
Oh, what are his orders?

442
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,828
He will interview
Mr. Adair himself.

443
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,580
Right, send Mr. Adair in.

444
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:08,092
What the devil's
the meaning of this?

445
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:05,565
Adair.

446
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:12,072
Adair.

447
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:17,411
My god, am I drunk?

448
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,872
I hope not at 10
o'clock in the morning.

449
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,168
What's all this about?

450
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:26,087
I was seized in a
car, blindfolded,

451
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:27,982
and driven half around London.

452
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:29,340
I apologize for that,

453
00:25:29,674 --> 00:25:31,634
but it was just a
slight precaution.

454
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:34,929
And you must forgive me
concealing my identity

455
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,681
behind the Sleeping Cardinal.

456
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:39,307
Please sit down.

457
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,363
Are you Mr. Clink?

458
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:56,908
Mr. Otto Clink?

459
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:57,952
No.

460
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:00,830
Poor Otto Clink must've
been dead a good many years.

461
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:02,433
What the devil's
the meaning of this?

462
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:04,167
Only that I
have a slight favor

463
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,418
to ask of you, Mr. Adair.

464
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,045
A favor.

465
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:09,547
Who are you anyway?

466
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,191
I understand
that you are leaving

467
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:14,052
on the Golden Arrow at 11
o'clock tomorrow for Paris.

468
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:15,386
And if I am?

469
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,889
You are going on
Foreign Office business,

470
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:19,849
and you will have
a laissez-passer,

471
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:21,851
which means that your luggage

472
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,811
will not be examined
by the custom.

473
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,607
I want you to take a
suitcase to Paris for me.

474
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:29,776
I'll do nothing of the kind!

475
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:31,694
Why should I?

476
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:33,738
Because you
can't help yourself.

477
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:34,781
Don't be ridiculous!

478
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:35,864
Sit down, Adair.

479
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:37,074
You go to hell!

480
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:38,158
Sit down.

481
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,287
You have been cheating at cards.

482
00:26:42,413 --> 00:26:43,414
- What?
- I repeat.

483
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,541
You have been cheating at cards.

484
00:26:48,795 --> 00:26:49,712
I should've warned you

485
00:26:49,796 --> 00:26:51,881
that this picture
is painted on steel.

486
00:26:55,218 --> 00:26:56,218
Sit down.

487
00:26:59,138 --> 00:27:02,225
All your life you have been
interested in slight of hand.

488
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:05,394
Your trick of palming
a whole pack of cards

489
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:08,648
has been very useful to you
since your trustee absconded

490
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:11,901
and left you and your
sister penniless.

491
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:13,319
It's a lie!

492
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:14,963
You have taken
to playing bridge

493
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:16,155
for very high stakes.

494
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:18,074
When you deal,

495
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:21,119
you simply change the pack
after it has been cut to you.

496
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:24,705
You have a carefully prepared
pack in the palm of your hand.

497
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:29,168
You do the same when you cut
a pack for your opponent.

498
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:31,462
Now this procedure,

499
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:33,798
if publicly known,

500
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,717
is not likely to lead
to an advancement,

501
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:39,220
either social or diplomatic.

502
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,348
In fact, it means
the end of you.

503
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:46,232
Who's been telling you
this ridiculous story?

504
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,937
Last night
you made a slip.

505
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:51,649
You dropped the ace of spades.

506
00:27:53,776 --> 00:27:55,111
Now, I think I can count on

507
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:57,363
your doing me this
very slight service.

508
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:01,325
Goon.

509
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:02,970
A suitcase
bearing your initials

510
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:05,746
will be delivered at your
flat at 9:30 this evening.

511
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:09,125
You will pass it through
customs with your other luggage.

512
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,752
I understand you
have engaged a room

513
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,379
at the Bristol in Paris.

514
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,007
You will take your
luggage there,

515
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,925
and by 10 o'clock
tomorrow night,

516
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,678
the suitcase will have
vanished from your room.

517
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,222
You will make no comment.

518
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:26,267
What's in this
precious suitcase?

519
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,977
That does
not concern you.

520
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,146
Yes, but it might be anything!

521
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,647
Stolen jewels, bombs.

522
00:28:32,273 --> 00:28:33,191
Heaven knows what.

523
00:28:33,274 --> 00:28:35,693
No, I'll be damned if I'll
be made use of in this way!

524
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:38,279
I feel sure that
you will change your mind.

525
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,533
In the event of
your not doing so,

526
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:46,537
you will find the
only alternative

527
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:50,666
in the box on the table.

528
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:53,835
What do you mean?

529
00:28:59,133 --> 00:28:59,634
Here.

530
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,052
Come back, whoever you are.

531
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,135
What do you mean?

532
00:29:11,896 --> 00:29:13,105
The only alternative.

533
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:16,524
Oh, my god.

534
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:32,369
What are you trying to do?

535
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,269
I'm trying to see how
many Bank of England notes

536
00:29:34,293 --> 00:29:36,128
will go into a
parcel of this size.

537
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:38,547
You see, My Dear Watson,

538
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,841
this note should fit
into these creases.

539
00:29:43,594 --> 00:29:45,471
There you are, as
I thought exactly.

540
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:48,808
Yes, are you busy
this morning, Watson?

541
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,518
No, I kept the morning free.

542
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:52,937
I rather hoped you'd
see Kathleen Adair.

543
00:29:53,396 --> 00:29:54,396
She's due here now.

544
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:57,024
I sent her a note on the
way home from the bank.

545
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,609
Oh, that's very kind of you.

546
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:00,486
Then you'll have
a talk to Ronnie?

547
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:01,988
No, I want to talk about him.

548
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,240
He's in the diplomatic
service, isn't he?

549
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:06,200
Yes, but what's that
got to do with it?

550
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:09,662
What's what go to
do with what, Watson?

551
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:13,248
Come in.

552
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:14,875
Miss Adair to see you, sir.

553
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:19,338
How wonderful of you
to have managed this.

554
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:21,257
It's terribly kind
of you to see me.

555
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,590
Not at all.

556
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:23,717
Won't you sit down?

557
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:31,559
Now Watson has
told me how worried

558
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:32,727
you are about your brother,

559
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,562
but I don't quite
see what I can do.

560
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:36,772
I've been wondering

561
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:39,025
if you could find out
if it's really true.

562
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:41,235
If it is, and I can't
believe that it is,

563
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:45,031
perhaps you could frighten
him into giving up cards.

564
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:47,158
With whom does
he play as a rule?

565
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:49,577
Well, last night there
was Tony Rutherford.

566
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:51,912
Old Mr. Fisher.

567
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,276
Thomas Fisher,
the millionaire?

568
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,291
Yes,
and Colonel Henslowe,

569
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,625
an old friend of ours.

570
00:30:58,127 --> 00:30:59,127
Fisher?

571
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:00,712
I wonder...

572
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:06,344
Forgive me, Miss Adair,

573
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:09,597
but does your brother travel
at all on official business?

574
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,891
Quite a lot.

575
00:31:11,974 --> 00:31:13,476
In fact, he's off
to Paris tomorrow.

576
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,477
Ah, I thought so.

577
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,438
How long has he known that
he would be going tomorrow?

578
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,648
Three or four days, I think.

579
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,193
Where is your
brother at the moment?

580
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,277
I don't know.

581
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,237
At the Foreign Office
by now I should think.

582
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:26,989
He went out early this morning.

583
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:28,366
They sent a car for him.

584
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:30,534
Do you happen to know
where he had to go?

585
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:33,496
I think he said Hampstead.

586
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:35,373
I know it wasn't far.

587
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,625
He should be back at
the office by now.

588
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:38,709
Yes.

589
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,253
Yes, they think a great
deal of your brother

590
00:31:41,462 --> 00:31:42,671
at the Foreign Office.

591
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,339
They used to,

592
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,176
but lately he's been
playing so much bridge,

593
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:49,428
I'm afraid he's been
neglecting his work.

594
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:51,679
That's a pity.

595
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:54,326
I wonder if you'd be good
enough to ask your brother

596
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,935
to come and see
me this afternoon?

597
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:58,687
Of course, I'll go around
to the Foreign Office now.

598
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:00,981
I might just catch him.

599
00:32:01,065 --> 00:32:02,066
Why not telephone?

600
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,543
He hates being rung up there,

601
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:05,736
and I couldn't explain
on the telephone.

602
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,381
What shall I do if I miss him?

603
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,156
Well, when will
you be seeing him?

604
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:10,199
Tonight.

605
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:12,535
He's dining out, and he's
bound to come in to dress.

606
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:13,702
Very well, in that case,

607
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:15,287
would you be good
enough to ask him

608
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,307
to come and see me in the
morning before he starts?

609
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:18,707
That's awfully kind of you.

610
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,292
Don't mention bridge to him.

611
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:21,836
As a matter of fact,

612
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,171
I shall not say a word
on that subject myself,

613
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:26,924
but you may rest assured
that after he has seen me,

614
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:31,220
he will never gamble again.

615
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,056
I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

616
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:35,682
Not at all.

617
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,351
It's I who am grateful to you.

618
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:45,859
Goodbye.

619
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:48,903
Watson?

620
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:51,197
Yes?

621
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:58,598
What's all this mean, Holmes?

622
00:32:58,622 --> 00:32:59,915
It means, My Dear Watson,

623
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:01,852
that the Foreign Office
doesn't send a car

624
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:04,628
to take a very unimportant
young man to Hampstead.

625
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:15,805
Hello?

626
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:17,974
Hello?

627
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:19,851
Yes, speaking.

628
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:22,395
Who's that?

629
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:24,397
Mrs. Smith?

630
00:33:24,815 --> 00:33:26,108
I seem to know that name.

631
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:28,276
Mrs. Annie Smith?

632
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:31,363
A Mrs. Torboy has
put you on to me.

633
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:34,783
I don't think I
know a Mrs. Torboy.

634
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:39,830
No, you're quite right
it doesn't matter.

635
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:42,917
You think it's appendicitis?

636
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:44,960
What's the address?

637
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:47,213
Would you mind taking
this down, Holmes?

638
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,341
1006 Fentonville Road.

639
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:53,928
Yes.

640
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:55,095
Yes, I'll come at once.

641
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:56,179
I'll take a taxi.

642
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:58,264
Goodbye.

643
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,060
Here's the address.

644
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:03,562
I've added a note which
I want you to read

645
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:04,897
when you've found a taxi.

646
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,898
What's it about?

647
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:07,858
You read it when
you've found a taxi.

648
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:10,611
I hope your friend
Mrs. Torboy's friend

649
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:12,112
is not as bad as she thinks.

650
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,498
Now what is it?

651
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:25,000
Please, mother said can
I have Paul's pajamas.

652
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:27,378
They've blown off our
line into your backyard.

653
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:29,004
You have no right to hang out

654
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:30,839
your washing and your whatnots

655
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:32,758
in a respectable
neighborhood like this.

656
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:35,803
Mom said if you started
carrying on about the washing,

657
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:37,680
I wasn't to stand
any of your lip.

658
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:39,890
Your mother said that?

659
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:41,183
Yes, she did.

660
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:43,644
Well, I've never heard such
impotence in all my born days.

661
00:34:43,727 --> 00:34:45,604
You go, and I'll
give your mother lip.

662
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:46,730
You wait.

663
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:49,692
Mother said I was to take the
pajamas and not talk to you.

664
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:51,777
She doesn't think
you're respectable.

665
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:53,237
What's that?

666
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
She says it's disgraceful,

667
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:57,116
a widow living in a house
full of nothing but men.

668
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:58,450
Now, you wait a minute.

669
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:00,327
I'll give her respectable.

670
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:01,453
Go on, off it!

671
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:02,454
Go on, up you go!

672
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:03,831
Oh, my word, respectable.

673
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:11,130
- Yes, come in.
- Mr. Holmes, sir.

674
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,256
- Yes.
- Sir.

675
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:16,444
I'm just going to step
around to that Mrs. Freeman.

676
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,554
I've got a few things
I want to say to her.

677
00:35:19,513 --> 00:35:20,513
Yes, Mrs. Hudson,

678
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,600
but what has upset you?

679
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:24,018
Well, she just told me.

680
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:25,861
She sent her daughter
around to say that I...

681
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:28,731
Well, I won't demean myself
by saying what she did say.

682
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:31,734
But I want you to know I
shall be out 20 minutes.

683
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:35,321
Well I wouldn't be too violent
if I were you, Mrs. Hudson.

684
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:38,448
Violent!

685
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:40,826
Indeed, I'll set her
back so good and proper!

686
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,746
Indeed I would if it wasn't
for my chronic enteritis!

687
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,771
Come in, Professor.

688
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,236
You think you
know me, Mr. Holmes.

689
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:00,863
Why not?

690
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:03,033
You called upon me once before.

691
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:05,327
On that occasion your face

692
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,080
was completely covered
with surgical bandages,

693
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:10,833
but your arrival
coincided with the same

694
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,751
removal of Watson
and Mrs. Hudson.

695
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,965
You were a little more original
in your methods last time.

696
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:19,883
Today, I recognized
the symptoms.

697
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,887
I was expecting you, Moriarty.

698
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,058
How clever of you, Holmes.

699
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:33,272
Won't you take off
your scarf, Professor.

700
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:39,820
Perhaps you're right.

701
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:41,405
This room is rather drafty.

702
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:43,281
Shall we sit down?

703
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:48,763
I'm afraid my
method of getting rid

704
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:51,123
of Watson and Mrs. Hudson
was a trifle crude.

705
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,001
But I had a sudden impulse,

706
00:37:54,084 --> 00:37:55,919
and anyhow it
served its purpose.

707
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:58,756
Except that our interview
will be a brief one.

708
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:01,383
Watson will have read
my note in the taxi

709
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:02,926
telling him to ignore the call

710
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,887
and come back here
in five minutes.

711
00:38:05,512 --> 00:38:07,014
In that case, I will be brief.

712
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,103
On the fourth of May 1928,

713
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,149
you crossed my path.

714
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,152
A dangerous thing to do, Holmes.

715
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:24,239
Eight months later, to be exact,

716
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,074
the 20th of January 1929,

717
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,746
you incommoded me seriously.

718
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:34,541
Yes, you made a bad
slip in 1929, didn't you?

719
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:36,794
Nearly had you, Professor.

720
00:38:36,877 --> 00:38:39,630
And now I find
you so constantly in my way

721
00:38:40,506 --> 00:38:43,175
that it would be better
for me if you were removed.

722
00:38:46,053 --> 00:38:49,139
Perhaps what I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

723
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:53,602
Possibly my answer
may have crossed yours.

724
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:55,354
You stand fast?

725
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:56,854
Absolutely.

726
00:38:56,939 --> 00:38:58,023
A great pity, Holmes.

727
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:01,860
I have a great respect
for your mentality.

728
00:39:04,238 --> 00:39:05,238
A great pity.

729
00:39:06,698 --> 00:39:09,368
You're getting in the way
of a great organization,

730
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,288
the full extent
of which even you,

731
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:15,666
with all your cleverness,
cannot realize.

732
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:19,711
You wish to put me in the dock.

733
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,130
You never will.

734
00:39:26,134 --> 00:39:27,134
If you destroy me,

735
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:29,763
rest assured I shall
do as much for you.

736
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:33,433
That's very
interesting, Professor,

737
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:35,477
but your five minutes are up.

738
00:39:37,062 --> 00:39:39,022
I fancy I hear the
arrival of Watson.

739
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:43,235
May I offer you a
piece of advice?

740
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,446
Never give way to
sudden impulses.

741
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,741
They're even more
dangerous to you than I am.

742
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:54,288
I read your note, Holmes.

743
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:56,039
Oh, I beg your pardon.

744
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:57,291
Did you come to see me?

745
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,711
Your friend is
in great danger.

746
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:08,885
Great danger.

747
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:16,870
What's the matter with him?

748
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:18,103
It is the draft, Watson.

749
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:21,607
He's feeling the draft
very badly at this moment.

750
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:24,066
But who was he?

751
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:27,195
- Well, that was Mrs.
- Smith of 1006 Fentonville.

752
00:40:30,157 --> 00:40:30,741
Missus?

753
00:40:30,991 --> 00:40:32,409
Or shall we say Professor?

754
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:34,620
Oh, the mythical Moriarty.

755
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,123
What does he look like?

756
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:39,708
Well, I know no
more than you do,

757
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,210
except that the first
molar in the left side

758
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,880
of the upper jaw is very
badly filled with gold.

759
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:50,010
Have you a mathematical
mind, Watson?

760
00:40:52,638 --> 00:40:53,638
I think so, fairly.

761
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,391
Well, never give way
to sudden impulses.

762
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:58,477
They're not good
for mathematicians.

763
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,772
Moriarty has made the worst slip

764
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:04,358
he's made since January 1929.

765
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,904
You mean you think you
found out how to get him?

766
00:41:09,112 --> 00:41:11,114
No, I found out where
he gets his boots.

767
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:14,076
I wish you'd be serious.

768
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,369
The professor's boots

769
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:17,788
are made by Mr. J.J.
Godfrey, bootmaker.

770
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:21,207
Yes, here we are.

771
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:23,626
502 Pond Street,

772
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:26,462
Southwest One.

773
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:28,131
Godfrey of Pond Street?

774
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,341
Yes.

775
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:31,259
Well, that's where
I had mine made.

776
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:33,553
You do surprise me.

777
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:36,390
But Godfrey's a perfectly
respectable tradesman

778
00:41:36,974 --> 00:41:38,392
with a high-class clientele.

779
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:39,475
Well, obviously.

780
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:40,936
Obviously, you and Moriarty,

781
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:43,313
you share a bootmaker
with the professor,

782
00:41:44,022 --> 00:41:46,692
and for all I know he may
be a great friend of yours.

783
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,067
Oh, really, Holmes.

784
00:41:58,078 --> 00:42:00,622
Does Mr. Godfrey make
his boots on the premises?

785
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,044
Yes, in the basement.

786
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:08,463
He showed me over
his workshop once.

787
00:42:09,798 --> 00:42:10,798
Yes.

788
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:13,343
I think I'd like to
see over that workshop.

789
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:17,389
We'll arrange with
Lestrade to call there

790
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:19,016
about eight o'clock tonight.

791
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,351
But can how it possibly matter

792
00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:23,103
where Moriarty buys his boots?

793
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,732
Only that this
piece of brown paper,

794
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:31,194
which was found in the
strong room of the bank,

795
00:42:32,487 --> 00:42:35,365
bears a piece of the label of
Mr. J.J. Godfrey, bootmaker.

796
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:39,619
Holmes, you're marvelous.

797
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:42,873
Elementary, My Dear Watson.

798
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:02,349
Well, that's that.

799
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:03,971
Now what am I to do with it?

800
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:06,188
You will be at Down
Street tube station

801
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:07,355
at nine o'clock precisely.

802
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,982
You'll take the
suitcase with you.

803
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:10,901
Oh, it's all right
it keeps the time.

804
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,944
It isn't eight o'clock yet.

805
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:15,113
In the main entrance,

806
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:17,077
you'll see a man with a
scar on his left temple.

807
00:43:17,157 --> 00:43:19,034
He will take the
suitcase from you.

808
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:20,618
Yes, sir.

809
00:43:20,744 --> 00:43:21,744
The keys?

810
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:25,999
- There we are, sir.
- Good.

811
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,668
Looks a good bit of work.

812
00:43:29,086 --> 00:43:30,086
Yes, sir.

813
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:31,128
I'm a good workman.

814
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:33,547
Moran.

815
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,841
Oh, the chief's here.

816
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:37,385
I have
just been informed

817
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:40,722
that Inspector Lestrade
has left Scotland Yard

818
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:43,100
in a powerful car
with police constables

819
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:44,684
number 47, 54, and 83.

820
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:49,064
All of the C Division.

821
00:43:50,232 --> 00:43:52,776
They will doubtless
call for Sherlock Holmes

822
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:55,112
and that great
detective Dr. Watson.

823
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,657
Don't attempt to
hide the suitcase.

824
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:00,909
It would look suspicious,

825
00:44:01,785 --> 00:44:03,537
and see that everything is tidy.

826
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:05,956
If the police detain you,

827
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:09,584
I have arranged for someone
else to take the suitcase.

828
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:13,088
Come in here, Moran.

829
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:14,881
You heard?

830
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:16,090
Yes, sir.

831
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:50,333
Put this right,
Godfrey, will you?

832
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:51,876
All right, sir.

833
00:45:38,173 --> 00:45:39,591
Which of you is Mr. Godfrey?

834
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
I am.

835
00:45:43,803 --> 00:45:45,138
Here's my search warrant.

836
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,598
Search warrant?

837
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:48,099
Well, what are
you searching for?

838
00:45:48,183 --> 00:45:49,726
You'll know when
I've found it.

839
00:45:51,478 --> 00:45:52,771
Why, if it isn't Dr. Watson.

840
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:56,942
Hope the last pair of shoes
I made were satisfactory.

841
00:45:58,568 --> 00:46:00,070
I see you're wearing them now.

842
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:01,071
Yes, quite, thanks.

843
00:46:01,154 --> 00:46:03,448
I say, Holmes, this
does seem rather absurd.

844
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:06,409
You know, Godfrey's
made my shoes for years.

845
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:09,371
Yes, your shoe last is in
that cupboard over there now.

846
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:11,831
Over there?

847
00:46:11,915 --> 00:46:13,083
- Yes.
- I'll go and find it.

848
00:46:18,046 --> 00:46:20,548
I suppose, Godfrey, you
know what we've come for.

849
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:23,301
I haven't the slightest idea.

850
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:36,314
Hello, starting
out a new branch, eh?

851
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:40,109
Oh, that.

852
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:41,611
Yes that's an experiment.

853
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,155
Special order for
a new customer.

854
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,449
Thought I might as
well try my hand at it.

855
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:49,494
I'm glad to see you look
after your work people, Godfrey.

856
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:53,248
Well, I've only
got three of them.

857
00:46:54,874 --> 00:46:57,627
There's Roberts and Williams
and his brother here.

858
00:46:59,546 --> 00:47:00,880
Well, you look after them.

859
00:47:01,256 --> 00:47:03,133
The place is
properly ventilated.

860
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:07,177
Ventilated?

861
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:12,474
Oh, that.

862
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:14,727
Yes, sir.

863
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:16,603
Yeah.

864
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:24,029
Oh, yes, a ventilator.

865
00:47:35,707 --> 00:47:36,916
Where's that door lead?

866
00:47:38,918 --> 00:47:39,918
To the area,

867
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:41,337
but as you can see,

868
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,214
it hasn't been opened for years.

869
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:44,841
Well, I should
like you to open it.

870
00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:46,801
Heaven only knows
where the key is.

871
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:49,179
That door hasn't been opened

872
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:50,472
since I don't know when.

873
00:47:51,723 --> 00:47:52,723
Godfrey,

874
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:54,118
this is curious-looking thing.

875
00:47:54,142 --> 00:47:55,310
What do you use it for?

876
00:47:55,518 --> 00:47:56,936
It's used for special work.

877
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,904
So you wanted to know what
I was looking for, Godfrey?

878
00:48:08,448 --> 00:48:09,448
Well, you know now.

879
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:11,368
I was looking for a press

880
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:13,953
that made perfect
Bank of England notes.

881
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:16,122
Take them all away.

882
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:22,879
What are you doing?

883
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:25,507
Quick follow this
wire, Lestrade.

884
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:27,174
What for?

885
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:34,099
Come one quick, Lestrade,
help me get this door down.

886
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:40,813
On one!

887
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:56,578
Watson.

888
00:48:56,621 --> 00:48:57,621
Damn.

889
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:10,135
Have another drink,
My Dear Watson.

890
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,261
You'll feel better.

891
00:49:11,553 --> 00:49:12,637
Thanks, I'm all right.

892
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:15,472
I haven't a scratch.

893
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:17,392
It was a bit of a
shock being seized

894
00:49:17,475 --> 00:49:18,810
and trussed up like that.

895
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:19,935
You saw nobody?

896
00:49:20,395 --> 00:49:21,395
Nothing.

897
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:23,106
I was standing in the cupboard.

898
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:24,274
The shelves swung around.

899
00:49:24,357 --> 00:49:26,317
I was seized from
behind and blindfolded.

900
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:28,611
Well, anyway, we've
done a good night's work.

901
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,739
My theory of the bank
robbery is proving correct.

902
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:34,451
What does your finding
a forger's outfit

903
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:37,495
in a bootmaker's basement got
to do with a bank robbery,

904
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:38,973
which wasn't a robbery at all?

905
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:40,290
Well, I'll try to explain.

906
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:46,588
Within a fortnight the
strong rooms of two banks

907
00:49:46,713 --> 00:49:48,673
are entered by
unauthorized persons,

908
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:50,049
and nothing is removed.

909
00:49:50,675 --> 00:49:51,675
But in each case,

910
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,220
something is taken
into the strong room.

911
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:57,849
In the case of the
Reichsbank, a cardboard box.

912
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:00,977
In the case of the Commercial,

913
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,978
a piece of brown paper.

914
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:04,481
Well, he wanted to take
the notes away in them.

915
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:06,941
The brown paper
had been creased

916
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:09,194
and folded around something.

917
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,070
Well?

918
00:50:11,237 --> 00:50:13,573
Mr. Godfrey's printing
press makes perfect.

919
00:50:14,157 --> 00:50:15,366
Bank of England notes.

920
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:17,952
Now supposing they
have an accomplice

921
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:20,663
who gives them the numbers
of the notes in stock,

922
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:22,790
they make duplicates.

923
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,375
Probably perfect duplicates

924
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:27,086
if my friend Moriarty has
anything to do with it.

925
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:30,048
They change these
for the real ones.

926
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:33,927
Now the forgeries have
to arrive at the bank

927
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:36,888
uncreased and spotless.

928
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:39,182
Hence, the brown paper.

929
00:50:39,432 --> 00:50:41,684
But the real ones can
be taken away anyhow.

930
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:43,436
Shoved into pockets, anything,

931
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,355
and the paper discarded.

932
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:48,608
The robbery will not be
discovered until two notes

933
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:51,319
of the same number arrive
at the Bank of England,

934
00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:56,032
and the longer that event
is postponed the better.

935
00:50:56,908 --> 00:50:58,743
So what does my
learned friend do?

936
00:50:59,911 --> 00:51:00,912
Well, holds them up.

937
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:02,997
No, no, My Dear Watson.

938
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:05,917
No, there's no use having
70,000 pounds worth of notes

939
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,085
if you don't use them.

940
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:09,087
Then he must start
circulating them.

941
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,505
Yeah, or send them abroad.

942
00:51:10,922 --> 00:51:12,465
Oh, no, that sounds difficult.

943
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:15,176
You see, customs officials
might ask questions

944
00:51:15,385 --> 00:51:17,971
if they opened a trunk full
of Bank of England notes.

945
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:19,681
Yeah, how true,
Watson, how true.

946
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,058
Well, in any case,

947
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:24,060
I don't feel I've been
trussed up for nothing.

948
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:26,312
It was worth it to find
that printing press.

949
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:27,831
The printing press,
My Dear Watson,

950
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:30,191
was valuable to get
your friend Mr. Godfrey

951
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:31,859
a term of penal servitude,

952
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:34,988
but the really important
discovery was the suitcase.

953
00:51:37,073 --> 00:51:38,073
Suitcase?

954
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,385
You probably didn't observe

955
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:41,369
that on the lid were
the initials R.A.

956
00:51:41,452 --> 00:51:43,329
I didn't, but what
does that signify?

957
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:46,332
Ronald Adair is leaving
tomorrow morning for Paris

958
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,793
on Foreign Office business.

959
00:51:49,586 --> 00:51:51,772
He will have a diplomatic
passport and a laissez-passer,

960
00:51:51,796 --> 00:51:54,549
which means that his luggage
will not be examined.

961
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:57,010
Well, you can't
connect him with...

962
00:51:59,554 --> 00:52:01,556
Good heavens, you don't
think he's one of the gang.

963
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:03,516
Supposing Moriarty
were to threaten

964
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,268
to expose his bridge exploits.

965
00:52:05,518 --> 00:52:07,145
But how should Moriarty know?

966
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,605
Well, how do I know it then?

967
00:52:11,482 --> 00:52:12,692
What time is it, Watson?

968
00:52:13,192 --> 00:52:14,402
It's quarter till 11:00.

969
00:52:14,986 --> 00:52:17,488
Well, I wonder if we
could get hold of Adair now.

970
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:19,324
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

971
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:20,450
Miss Adair

972
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:21,677
sent a message to say that she

973
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:23,220
missed her brother at
the Foreign Office,

974
00:52:23,244 --> 00:52:25,014
and that she'd send him
around in the morning.

975
00:52:25,038 --> 00:52:26,557
Well, ring her up
now, Watson, will you,

976
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,309
and see if we can get
hold of him right away?

977
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,792
- Yes, certainly.
- If I'm right,

978
00:52:29,876 --> 00:52:32,837
that young man is the one
weak spot in Moriarty's armor.

979
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:36,382
If I can get hold of
him, Moriarty's wrong.

980
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:39,510
He will stand in
the dock tomorrow

981
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:41,846
and not long after
on the gallows.

982
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:08,997
Mr. Adair!

983
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:10,165
Mr. Adair!

984
00:53:21,928 --> 00:53:22,928
Mr. Adair?

985
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:24,763
Mr. Adair?

986
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:33,523
Hello?

987
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:34,856
Yes, yes.

988
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:36,358
You can't, sir.

989
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:37,694
You can't he's killed.

990
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:41,155
Yes, I've just found him
shot through the head.

991
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:47,120
Is it usual
for you to go to bed

992
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:48,371
as early as 10 o'clock?

993
00:53:48,663 --> 00:53:50,331
Yes, sir, when
there's no company.

994
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:53,668
And you
heard nothing at all?

995
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:55,086
No, sir.

996
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,420
- No.
- You see,

997
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:58,440
our bedrooms are all at
the back of the building,

998
00:53:58,464 --> 00:54:00,883
completely cut off from
the rest of the flat.

999
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:02,592
I see.

1000
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:03,720
Thank you.

1001
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:04,947
Would you send the butler to me?

1002
00:54:04,971 --> 00:54:06,264
- Yes, sir.
- You can go too.

1003
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:12,186
But surely, Lestrade,

1004
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,856
considering what I've told
you about the bridge party,

1005
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:16,816
it was obviously
a case of suicide.

1006
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,235
Then where is the revolver?

1007
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,571
Well, he must've thrown
it out of the window.

1008
00:54:21,654 --> 00:54:23,173
Well, the bullet didn't
penetrate the brain.

1009
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:26,409
He may have been conscious for
a few seconds after the shot,

1010
00:54:28,453 --> 00:54:29,370
and his fireplace shows

1011
00:54:29,454 --> 00:54:31,038
that he'd be burning
his correspondence.

1012
00:54:31,122 --> 00:54:32,790
A good deal of correspondence.

1013
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,043
Then what about the
letter he was writing?

1014
00:54:36,544 --> 00:54:37,628
I can't make that out.

1015
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:40,673
"The Sleeping Cardinal
forced me to..."

1016
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:45,344
I can't think what it means.

1017
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:47,763
Oh, Mr. Holmes.

1018
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:51,642
Would you care to
examine the servants?

1019
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:56,939
The cook and the housemaid
neither saw nor heard anything.

1020
00:54:58,941 --> 00:54:59,859
No, no, no, Lestrade.

1021
00:54:59,942 --> 00:55:01,027
No, no, no, you carry on.

1022
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:02,612
No, I'll just amuse myself.

1023
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:05,531
We found this on
the table in front of him.

1024
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:07,784
"The Sleeping Cardinal...

1025
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:11,996
"The Sleeping Cardinal,"

1026
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,248
now where have I heard
that name before?

1027
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:26,928
You're the butler here.

1028
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:27,970
Yes, sir.

1029
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:29,661
Have you been with
the family long?

1030
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:30,640
Three years, sir.

1031
00:55:30,723 --> 00:55:31,808
Then you know their ways.

1032
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:33,684
Did anything unusual
occur here this evening?

1033
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:34,768
No, sir.

1034
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,771
Miss Adair dined alone at home,

1035
00:55:37,355 --> 00:55:39,649
and Mr. Adair came in
at a quarter past nine

1036
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:42,360
with Colonel Henslowe.

1037
00:55:42,443 --> 00:55:43,528
Who is Colonel Henslowe?

1038
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:45,279
He's an old friend
of the family.

1039
00:55:45,363 --> 00:55:47,073
He knew Ronnie Adair's
father in India.

1040
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:50,243
Sir Henry Adair was Governor
General of Bengal, you know.

1041
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:52,161
They used to hunt
tigers together.

1042
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:54,831
Did you gather at all
what they were talking about

1043
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:55,832
when they came in?

1044
00:55:55,915 --> 00:55:57,458
- Well, sir, Mr.
- Adair was saying,

1045
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,086
"And you think Fisher
means trouble?"

1046
00:56:01,587 --> 00:56:02,880
That was all I heard, sir.

1047
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:05,091
How long was the Colonel here?

1048
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:06,592
Barely half an hour, sir.

1049
00:56:06,676 --> 00:56:08,010
Was Miss Adair with them?

1050
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:09,512
No, sir, she was in her room.

1051
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:12,139
Was anyone else in the flat?

1052
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:13,516
No, sir.

1053
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,477
You're positive that there
was no one else at all?

1054
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:18,312
No, sir.

1055
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:21,524
Oh, a man came about half
past nine with a new suitcase

1056
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:24,610
that Mr. Adair had ordered.

1057
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:25,861
What kind of a man?

1058
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:28,906
I didn't notice him
particularly, sir.

1059
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:31,033
He wasn't actually
inside the flat.

1060
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:33,244
He just handed me the case,

1061
00:56:33,536 --> 00:56:34,453
and I signed for it.

1062
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,080
Where did the case come from?

1063
00:56:36,497 --> 00:56:37,915
I really didn't notice, sir.

1064
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:39,959
I Just told Mr.
Adair it was here,

1065
00:56:40,918 --> 00:56:42,169
and he told me to put it with

1066
00:56:42,253 --> 00:56:44,088
the other luggage
in his bedroom.

1067
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:50,176
Which one?

1068
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:51,679
That's the odd thing, sir.

1069
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:54,097
It isn't here,

1070
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:55,683
and I can't find it anywhere,

1071
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:57,810
though I searched the flat.

1072
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,688
It was quite an
ordinary sort of case.

1073
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:03,399
Can't think where
it could get hidden.

1074
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,234
But it must be somewhere.

1075
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:07,445
Unless Mr. Adair took it out.

1076
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:08,905
He didn't go out, sir.

1077
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:11,741
He went straight to his room
after the Colonel had left.

1078
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:14,327
Why didn't Miss Adair
come and see the Colonel?

1079
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:16,913
Wasn't she friendly with him?

1080
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:18,122
Oh, yes, sir.

1081
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:19,749
She was quite friendly with him.

1082
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:21,542
Wasn't she friendly
with her brother?

1083
00:57:21,626 --> 00:57:23,377
They were devoted
to each other.

1084
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:25,004
They were, sir.

1085
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:26,857
But there was a bit of a
shindy last night, sir.

1086
00:57:26,881 --> 00:57:29,550
Well, she never mentioned
anything about it to me.

1087
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:31,177
No, sir.

1088
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:33,971
It was after you and the
other gentlemen had left.

1089
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:36,057
I can't think it
was a serious quarrel.

1090
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:37,850
I beg pardon, sir, it was.

1091
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:40,478
I brought in a
note for Mr. Adair,

1092
00:57:40,978 --> 00:57:42,980
and I don't think
they heard me come in.

1093
00:57:43,356 --> 00:57:44,273
What were they saying?

1094
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:46,359
Well, sir, Miss
Adair was very excited,

1095
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:49,362
and she said, "I'd rather put
a bullet through your head

1096
00:57:50,446 --> 00:57:51,656
"than own a brother who..."

1097
00:57:52,782 --> 00:57:54,450
And then she saw me and stopped.

1098
00:57:55,368 --> 00:57:56,494
Directly afterwards,

1099
00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:57,787
Mr. Adair left the room.

1100
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,498
And tonight how did you
know he'd been killed?

1101
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:03,584
The phone bell was
ringing in this room,

1102
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,378
which was locked,

1103
00:58:05,461 --> 00:58:07,213
and I got no answer
to my knocking.

1104
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:08,296
What did you do?

1105
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:09,548
I broke down the door,

1106
00:58:09,882 --> 00:58:11,968
and then I found Mr.
Adair in that chair,

1107
00:58:13,386 --> 00:58:14,929
lying across the table dead,

1108
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:17,431
and the window open.

1109
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:19,183
How long had he
been in his room?

1110
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:20,476
Abut half an hour, sir.

1111
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,769
And you heard nothing?

1112
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:23,436
Not a sound, sir.

1113
00:58:23,813 --> 00:58:24,730
And I was in my pantry,

1114
00:58:24,814 --> 00:58:26,565
which is on this
side of the flat.

1115
00:58:27,441 --> 00:58:28,359
Thank you, Marston.

1116
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:30,277
Would you ask Miss
Adair to come here?

1117
00:58:30,361 --> 00:58:31,654
- Yes.
- I think if I were you

1118
00:58:31,737 --> 00:58:33,739
I should see Colonel
Henslowe first.

1119
00:58:35,032 --> 00:58:36,867
I understand he's
with Miss Adair.

1120
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:40,997
And after all, he was the last
person to see Adair alive.

1121
00:58:41,372 --> 00:58:43,582
Yes, will you ask the
Colonel to come here?

1122
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,542
Very good, sir.

1123
00:58:49,714 --> 00:58:52,049
Well, that disposes
of your suicide theory.

1124
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,011
What do you mean?

1125
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:58,364
You're not suggesting
that Miss Adair...

1126
00:58:58,389 --> 00:58:59,849
At any rate, she
threatened him.

1127
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:01,934
But the door was
locked on the inside.

1128
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:05,645
Ah, Colonel.

1129
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:08,607
I don't think you know
Inspector Lestrade,

1130
00:59:09,025 --> 00:59:10,693
and my friend, Sherlock Holmes.

1131
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:13,362
Delighted to meet
two such famous people.

1132
00:59:14,363 --> 00:59:15,698
I also am delighted to meet

1133
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:17,867
such a distinguished
big game hunter.

1134
00:59:19,994 --> 00:59:21,328
My hunting days are over.

1135
00:59:22,913 --> 00:59:23,414
Yes.

1136
00:59:23,581 --> 00:59:26,083
That must be a great trial
to you of all people.

1137
00:59:27,752 --> 00:59:28,752
Was it the war?

1138
00:59:28,794 --> 00:59:30,087
No, a tiger mauled my arm.

1139
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:34,884
It turned septic and had to
be taken off at the shoulder.

1140
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:38,012
I'm lucky to be alive at all.

1141
00:59:38,637 --> 00:59:41,265
Yes, I'm immensely
ignorant about tiger hunting.

1142
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,518
Tell me, you go out on elephants
with beaters, don't you?

1143
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:47,438
Pardon me, Mr. Holmes,

1144
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,166
but I must ask the
Colonel a few questions.

1145
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,525
Yes, all right there,
Lestrade, just a minute.

1146
00:59:51,734 --> 00:59:53,736
I'm very interested
in tiger hunting.

1147
00:59:54,153 --> 00:59:56,155
Well, elephants
and beaters are used

1148
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,450
when royalty and
rajas hunt tigers,

1149
01:00:01,494 --> 01:00:02,703
but they're expensive.

1150
01:00:03,662 --> 01:00:04,662
Oh, very.

1151
01:00:05,915 --> 01:00:07,458
You can always tether a goat

1152
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:10,252
and wait till the
tiger comes for it.

1153
01:00:11,921 --> 01:00:12,921
Really, Mr. Holmes!

1154
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:14,423
I'm pressed for time,

1155
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:16,300
and I'm must ask the
Colonel a few questions!

1156
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:17,718
Well, fine, Lestrade, fine.

1157
01:00:18,886 --> 01:00:21,305
You were the last to see the
deceased alive, weren't you?

1158
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:23,724
Yes, he's been very
nervous since last night.

1159
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:27,561
He came around this evening

1160
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,980
and asked me to come
back with him for a chat.

1161
01:00:30,439 --> 01:00:33,526
I suppose you all know what
happened at the bridge party.

1162
01:00:35,277 --> 01:00:36,277
Yes.

1163
01:00:36,612 --> 01:00:39,115
One of the players
looked like me, unpleasant,

1164
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,575
and Adair wanted my advice.

1165
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:43,452
And what was your advice?

1166
01:00:43,536 --> 01:00:44,620
To do nothing at all.

1167
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,540
Even if it were true,

1168
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:48,833
nobody could prove it.

1169
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:51,001
And he was less
worried when you left?

1170
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,670
I think he was, a little.

1171
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,273
I understand a new suitcase

1172
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:57,258
was brought to the
house last night.

1173
01:00:58,384 --> 01:01:00,052
Were you there when it arrived?

1174
01:01:00,469 --> 01:01:01,469
I believe so.

1175
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:02,721
I never saw it,

1176
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:04,557
but I heard Ronnie tell Marston

1177
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:06,809
to take it into his bedroom.

1178
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:08,602
What time did you leave?

1179
01:01:08,853 --> 01:01:10,146
About a quarter to 10:00.

1180
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:14,733
And within three quarters
of an hour he was found dead.

1181
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:17,570
Surely, it's obvious
he shot himself.

1182
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:20,364
I disagree, My Dear Watson.

1183
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:23,116
He was murdered.

1184
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:24,410
Of course.

1185
01:01:24,493 --> 01:01:25,828
You don't really think so?

1186
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:27,454
Yes, My Dear Colonel,

1187
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:31,208
I'm certain of it,

1188
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,919
and what is more I'm sure
you'll all be glad to hear

1189
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:36,338
that within 24 hours,

1190
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:39,300
I shall not only be in
a position to prove it,

1191
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:43,304
but I shall have the
murderer under lock and key.

1192
01:01:44,221 --> 01:01:45,514
I'm delighted to hear it.

1193
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,392
Not that it can bring
the poor lad back.

1194
01:01:49,643 --> 01:01:51,604
You know, Ronnie,
with all his faults,

1195
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:54,940
was extraordinarily lovable.

1196
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:58,152
I feel rather as if
I had lost a son.

1197
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:01,155
Thank you, Colonel Henslowe.

1198
01:02:01,614 --> 01:02:02,948
I shan't need you anymore.

1199
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:06,952
Would you mind asking Miss
Adair to come to me a moment?

1200
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,620
Certainly.

1201
01:02:09,538 --> 01:02:10,539
Goodbye, Mr. Holmes.

1202
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:12,707
Goodbye, Colonel.

1203
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:20,591
I'm sorry I interrupted
you, Mr. Holmes,

1204
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,177
but you seemed so
interested in tigers,

1205
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:25,095
that I thought you were
never going to stop.

1206
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:26,263
Mm, they interest me.

1207
01:02:27,973 --> 01:02:29,058
The stark ferocity.

1208
01:02:29,892 --> 01:02:30,892
The cold cruelty,

1209
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:35,272
There are human beings sort
of like tigers, you know.

1210
01:02:35,356 --> 01:02:38,025
Now I suppose you're back
to your Moriarty theory.

1211
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,362
You're not gonna try and tell
me that this is his handiwork?

1212
01:02:41,445 --> 01:02:43,322
Well, who knows?

1213
01:02:44,823 --> 01:02:47,117
That man has become
an obsession with you.

1214
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:48,910
He is.

1215
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:50,245
He is.

1216
01:02:54,124 --> 01:02:55,124
Miss Adair,

1217
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:58,045
I want to offer you my
very sincere sympathy.

1218
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:03,050
It was a ghastly shock to me.

1219
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:05,552
I can imagine what it
must have been to you.

1220
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:09,098
I won't keep you a
minute, Miss Adair.

1221
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:11,349
Won't you sit down?

1222
01:03:16,605 --> 01:03:18,482
When did you last
see your brother?

1223
01:03:19,483 --> 01:03:20,483
At half past six.

1224
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:22,236
He came in to dress,

1225
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,238
and I came in here to
give him a message.

1226
01:03:24,321 --> 01:03:25,321
What was the message?

1227
01:03:25,364 --> 01:03:27,658
- I told him that Mr.
- Holmes wanted to see him

1228
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,118
before he went to Paris.

1229
01:03:29,201 --> 01:03:31,537
You see, I'd asked Mr.
Holmes to interview him.

1230
01:03:32,162 --> 01:03:33,162
What did he say?

1231
01:03:34,164 --> 01:03:35,164
He was upset.

1232
01:03:35,666 --> 01:03:37,793
In fact, we had rather
a quarrel about it.

1233
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:38,794
Another quarrel?

1234
01:03:38,877 --> 01:03:40,421
You had one the night before.

1235
01:03:40,879 --> 01:03:42,548
Yes, but this
was not so serious.

1236
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:46,302
He was merely annoyed that
I'd spoken to Mr. Holmes.

1237
01:03:47,177 --> 01:03:48,262
He was very annoyed?

1238
01:03:49,179 --> 01:03:50,179
Well, rather.

1239
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:53,309
He seemed more
frightened than annoyed.

1240
01:03:54,685 --> 01:03:55,894
I couldn't understand.

1241
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:57,396
So you quarreled again.

1242
01:03:58,355 --> 01:03:59,023
Well, yes.

1243
01:03:59,189 --> 01:04:02,067
He said I had no business
to interfere in his affairs.

1244
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:04,903
And did you again
threaten to shoot him?

1245
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:09,615
Shoot him?

1246
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:11,577
What do you mean?

1247
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:14,747
The night before your butler
heard you threatening him.

1248
01:04:16,081 --> 01:04:18,083
Oh, no, I never did
anything of the kind.

1249
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:22,212
I shoot Ronnie?

1250
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:25,299
You said you would rather
put a bullet through his head

1251
01:04:27,384 --> 01:04:28,302
than own a brother who...

1252
01:04:28,385 --> 01:04:30,262
Oh, that was only
a figure of speech!

1253
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:32,449
I was accusing him of something.

1254
01:04:32,473 --> 01:04:34,475
A most unfortunate
figure of speech,

1255
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:37,269
considering that within
24 hours he was found

1256
01:04:38,604 --> 01:04:40,272
with a bullet through his head.

1257
01:04:40,564 --> 01:04:41,708
But you don't think that I...

1258
01:04:41,732 --> 01:04:44,234
No, Miss, but I must ask
you to come along with me

1259
01:04:44,943 --> 01:04:46,403
after I've finished
my investigation.

1260
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:48,322
I say, Lestrade,
this is grotesque.

1261
01:04:50,324 --> 01:04:51,075
Holmes, listen.

1262
01:04:51,158 --> 01:04:52,993
Here's Lestrade suggesting
that Miss Adair...

1263
01:04:53,077 --> 01:04:54,161
No, Dr. Watson, I didn't.

1264
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:57,414
All I want is her to come
along and make a statement.

1265
01:04:57,664 --> 01:04:59,666
I'm sure Miss Adair
will be delighted

1266
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:01,502
to go with you, Lestrade.

1267
01:05:02,586 --> 01:05:03,879
It is quite a warm night.

1268
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:06,256
Anything you say, of course.

1269
01:05:06,632 --> 01:05:07,632
Thanks, Miss.

1270
01:05:07,841 --> 01:05:09,051
I shall be ready in a minute.

1271
01:05:09,134 --> 01:05:10,803
Then I'll go and
put on my things,

1272
01:05:11,595 --> 01:05:12,795
if you have no more questions.

1273
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:14,139
No, nothing else, thanks.

1274
01:05:22,606 --> 01:05:23,690
This is outrageous!

1275
01:05:24,817 --> 01:05:26,568
Well, Mr. Holmes,
what do you think?

1276
01:05:29,238 --> 01:05:30,531
It's really remarkable

1277
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,783
how many varieties of trees

1278
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,993
there are in these London parks.

1279
01:05:35,994 --> 01:05:37,931
Have you ever noticed what
remarkably fine specimens...

1280
01:05:37,955 --> 01:05:40,624
Really, Mr. Holmes, you're
a most extraordinary man.

1281
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:43,836
In the middle of an
investigation like this,

1282
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,130
you begin talking about trees.

1283
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:48,882
Holmes, you heard
Lestrade's ghastly accusation.

1284
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:52,636
Surely, it was suicide.

1285
01:05:53,303 --> 01:05:54,972
He burned his correspondence.

1286
01:05:57,141 --> 01:05:58,142
I don't think he did.

1287
01:05:59,268 --> 01:06:01,145
These are the ashes
of, I should say,

1288
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:04,064
at least a dozen packs
of playing cards.

1289
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,818
Because he was afraid Fisher
was going to expose him.

1290
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:10,612
My Dear Watson,

1291
01:06:10,696 --> 01:06:12,865
as I've already told
you, this was murder,

1292
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,659
and it was committed
from outside this room.

1293
01:06:16,285 --> 01:06:17,953
What, shot
through the keyhole?

1294
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:22,791
Ronald Adair burned
those playing cards,

1295
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,918
and they caused a
great deal of smoke.

1296
01:06:26,837 --> 01:06:30,048
He opened the window and sat
down to write that confession,

1297
01:06:32,926 --> 01:06:35,679
and the moment he sat down
he was shot from outside.

1298
01:06:38,265 --> 01:06:39,265
But how?

1299
01:06:42,478 --> 01:06:45,022
From this height you can
hardly see the street.

1300
01:06:45,439 --> 01:06:48,192
He would had to have been
hanging out of the window.

1301
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:49,609
And he wasn't.

1302
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:51,820
He was sitting in that chair.

1303
01:06:53,155 --> 01:06:54,281
And you're suggesting

1304
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:56,909
that somebody stood in
the middle of Park Lane,

1305
01:06:57,242 --> 01:06:59,578
between 10 and a half
past, and fired a rifle?

1306
01:07:01,121 --> 01:07:02,706
It would've had to
have been a rifle

1307
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:03,999
to carry as far as this.

1308
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,127
And that nobody saw
or heard anything.

1309
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:10,047
Though there must have been
hundreds of passers by?

1310
01:07:10,214 --> 01:07:12,382
Yes, passers by
there undoubtedly were.

1311
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:14,927
But as you doubtless
already ascertained,

1312
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:16,678
there were no police about.

1313
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:18,514
I beg your pardon, Mr. Holmes.

1314
01:07:18,972 --> 01:07:20,224
There are always police about.

1315
01:07:20,307 --> 01:07:22,976
There were a couple on
point duty at stand up gate.

1316
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:26,188
I find on inquiry that
three separate disturbances

1317
01:07:27,105 --> 01:07:30,317
occurred at precisely 10:15
in this neighborhood tonight.

1318
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:35,072
A lot of roughs who are
not accustomed to frequent

1319
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:38,033
the public house around
the corner refused to leave

1320
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:41,078
and were ejected by the police.

1321
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:43,747
A young woman drove
a car into a lorry

1322
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:45,350
not a hundred yards up the road,

1323
01:07:45,374 --> 01:07:48,335
and there was a false alarm
of fire in Hartford Street.

1324
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:52,798
It's curious that
all these things

1325
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:55,592
should've been
absolutely simultaneous.

1326
01:07:56,385 --> 01:07:58,887
But even supposing the
police were occupied,

1327
01:07:59,304 --> 01:08:02,266
you can't stand and fire a
rifle into a Park Lane window

1328
01:08:03,934 --> 01:08:06,770
without somebody having
seen and heard something.

1329
01:08:09,856 --> 01:08:10,856
How true.

1330
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,445
Do you know a hornbeam
when you see one?

1331
01:08:16,446 --> 01:08:17,447
- A hornbeam?
- Mm-hmm.

1332
01:08:18,907 --> 01:08:21,868
There are some remarkably
fine specimens in the park.

1333
01:08:23,287 --> 01:08:24,288
What is a hornbeam?

1334
01:08:24,705 --> 01:08:26,206
The Latin name is Carpinus.

1335
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,727
They're common in the
temperate zones of Asia

1336
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,712
and some parts of
Southern England.

1337
01:08:32,796 --> 01:08:33,964
It looks like a beech,

1338
01:08:34,923 --> 01:08:35,923
but it isn't.

1339
01:08:40,554 --> 01:08:41,555
You know, Dr. Watson,

1340
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,766
in spite of the fact that I've
known Holmes for some years,

1341
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,520
I sometimes wonder
if he's all there.

1342
01:08:58,155 --> 01:08:59,948
Put this in your
mouth for a few minute.

1343
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:01,032
Hmm, whatever for?

1344
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:02,743
I don't think
you're at all well.

1345
01:09:02,826 --> 01:09:04,620
Oh, nonsense, My
Dear Watson, nonsense.

1346
01:09:04,703 --> 01:09:05,847
I'm in the very best of health,

1347
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,831
in spite of a couple
of nasty shocks.

1348
01:09:08,498 --> 01:09:09,833
When did you have a shock.

1349
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:10,916
I said two.

1350
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:13,128
During the stroll I
took this afternoon,

1351
01:09:13,211 --> 01:09:15,714
I was just going to cross
the Marylebone Road.

1352
01:09:16,006 --> 01:09:19,009
The policemen on point duty
was holding up the traffic.

1353
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:22,310
When a two-horse van
apparently out of control

1354
01:09:22,387 --> 01:09:25,057
whizzed around the corner
and was on me in a flash.

1355
01:09:26,141 --> 01:09:27,059
I sprang to the pavement

1356
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:29,436
and saved myself by a
fraction of a second.

1357
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,020
Good heavens.

1358
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:32,749
Ten minutes later a brick fell

1359
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:35,651
from the roof of a house that
was shattered at my feet.

1360
01:09:36,234 --> 01:09:38,028
They were repairing
the roof at the time,

1361
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:40,322
but the police proved
it was an accident.

1362
01:09:41,114 --> 01:09:42,114
But, I know better.

1363
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:44,284
Very nasty indeed.

1364
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:47,162
But these things
happened this afternoon.

1365
01:09:47,537 --> 01:09:48,455
I was worrying about you

1366
01:09:48,538 --> 01:09:49,998
in the early hours
of the morning.

1367
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:51,082
What did I do?

1368
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:52,167
Do?

1369
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:55,045
In the middle of a terribly
serious conversation,

1370
01:09:55,128 --> 01:09:57,547
you started talking
about trees in the park

1371
01:09:57,756 --> 01:10:00,509
and the difference between
a hornbeam and a beech.

1372
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:01,760
Altogether disconnected,

1373
01:10:01,843 --> 01:10:03,637
and, I thought, a
little delirious.

1374
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,263
Yes, I did ramble
a bit, didn't I?

1375
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:07,849
And I'm sorry you made

1376
01:10:07,933 --> 01:10:10,435
what Lestrade called
a bombastic statement.

1377
01:10:10,852 --> 01:10:11,852
That within 24 hours,

1378
01:10:11,895 --> 01:10:14,064
12 of which by the
way have already gone,

1379
01:10:14,314 --> 01:10:15,399
you will have the murderer.

1380
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:17,043
You know, it wasn't at
all like you, Holmes.

1381
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:19,361
No, it did look as if I
were very ill, didn't it?

1382
01:10:21,238 --> 01:10:23,407
It gives Lestrade
such a chance to crow.

1383
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,326
He thinks he's done a
frightful lot and you nothing.

1384
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,495
He's disposed of my
suicide theory and...

1385
01:10:29,538 --> 01:10:30,539
And made an arrest.

1386
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:31,748
Who?

1387
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:34,126
I wonder he hasn't arrested
you or Mrs. Hudson.

1388
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:37,379
And he never stops talking
about this mythical Moriarty.

1389
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:39,923
Now, listen, My Dear Watson.

1390
01:10:43,218 --> 01:10:45,554
I have established to
my own satisfaction

1391
01:10:46,596 --> 01:10:48,140
that in both the Reichsbank

1392
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:49,617
and the Commercial Bank cases,

1393
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:52,144
forged notes were
substituted for real ones.

1394
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:54,521
Yeah.

1395
01:10:54,604 --> 01:10:57,107
I have also established
to my own satisfaction

1396
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:00,068
and through the missing
suitcase that Ronald Adair

1397
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:03,655
was to have taken those
English notes to Paris.

1398
01:11:03,989 --> 01:11:06,408
And the same brain that
planned that scheme

1399
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:10,203
planned the removal
of Ronald Adair.

1400
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,098
But why should they
remove their means

1401
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:13,891
of getting the notes
safely out of the country?

1402
01:11:13,915 --> 01:11:16,585
Because Ronald Adair
refused at the last minute.

1403
01:11:17,043 --> 01:11:18,043
Why should he?

1404
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:20,547
He was still open to
exposure as a cheat.

1405
01:11:20,839 --> 01:11:22,132
That's what frightened him.

1406
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:23,967
But I frightened
him still more.

1407
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:27,596
When his sister told him
that I wanted to see him,

1408
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,890
he was panic-stricken
because he realized

1409
01:11:29,973 --> 01:11:32,601
that his cheating could
only result in scandal.

1410
01:11:32,809 --> 01:11:34,436
The other meant certain jail.

1411
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:36,562
I see,

1412
01:11:36,897 --> 01:11:38,398
and what did you
make of that letter

1413
01:11:38,482 --> 01:11:40,901
he was writing about
the Sleeping Cardinal?

1414
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:42,569
Now that, My Dear Watson,

1415
01:11:42,652 --> 01:11:44,988
is the most significant
aspect of the case.

1416
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:50,160
Do you remember eight months
ago when Trimble the forger

1417
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:54,831
was found on the embankment
dying from terrible injuries?

1418
01:11:59,336 --> 01:12:00,336
He...

1419
01:12:01,463 --> 01:12:02,463
Yes?

1420
01:12:04,841 --> 01:12:05,841
Yes?

1421
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,680
Here.

1422
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:14,184
Yes, we mustn't forget
your appointment.

1423
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,060
Appointment?

1424
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,898
Yes, it's necessary for me
to remain alone a little while.

1425
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:23,443
So you, My Dear Watson,
are going to Euston.

1426
01:12:23,902 --> 01:12:25,070
Euston, whatever for?

1427
01:12:42,754 --> 01:12:43,754
What's the idea?

1428
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,880
You'll see.

1429
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:04,734
You're going to
have a busy night.

1430
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:07,195
Now, I want you to put
on your coat and hat.

1431
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,280
Take a suitcase.

1432
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:10,574
You needn't pack anything.

1433
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:13,285
Get a taxi, and make a
great fuss about getting it.

1434
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,328
Call Euston to the driver,

1435
01:13:15,412 --> 01:13:17,080
and tell him if
he doesn't hurry,

1436
01:13:17,372 --> 01:13:19,040
you'll miss the Scotch Express.

1437
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,375
The Scotch Express?

1438
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,500
Yes.

1439
01:13:22,252 --> 01:13:23,253
You'll be followed.

1440
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:26,423
The moment you get to
Euston, pay off the taxi,

1441
01:13:26,965 --> 01:13:29,050
and rush around to
the booking office.

1442
01:15:20,328 --> 01:15:22,497
Really, Mr. Holmes,
this is a bit too thick!

1443
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,874
My apologies, Mrs. Hudson.

1444
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:28,461
Once again you've proved
yourself far above ordinary women.

1445
01:15:29,295 --> 01:15:31,381
Well, Mr. Holmes, I
did what you told me to.

1446
01:15:31,548 --> 01:15:33,341
I moved the statue
every few minutes,

1447
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:36,386
when suddenly the whole blooming
thing falls on top of me.

1448
01:15:36,469 --> 01:15:38,430
But you've done very
well, Mrs. Hudson.

1449
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:41,557
Very well.

1450
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:44,436
Lestrade, bring in the prisoner.

1451
01:15:53,778 --> 01:15:55,196
Oh, may I see that, Lestrade?

1452
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,283
Thank you for that that's an
admirable an unique weapon.

1453
01:15:58,825 --> 01:16:01,578
Absolutely noiseless and
with tremendous power.

1454
01:16:02,954 --> 01:16:03,538
Crikey.

1455
01:16:03,788 --> 01:16:04,706
I knew Von Herda,

1456
01:16:04,789 --> 01:16:06,269
the German mechanic
who constructed it

1457
01:16:06,332 --> 01:16:08,293
to the order of
Professor Moriarty.

1458
01:16:08,835 --> 01:16:11,046
I've known of its
existence for some time,

1459
01:16:11,129 --> 01:16:12,756
but I never handled it before.

1460
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:14,466
Ah, Watson.

1461
01:16:14,549 --> 01:16:16,301
Appears I've just been murdered.

1462
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,679
Perhaps you'd like to
see who my assailant is.

1463
01:16:23,224 --> 01:16:23,975
As I thought.

1464
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:26,019
But, Holmes, that's
Colonel Henslowe.

1465
01:16:27,562 --> 01:16:29,397
And what are you
charging me with?

1466
01:16:29,856 --> 01:16:31,483
Why, for the attempted murder

1467
01:16:31,566 --> 01:16:32,710
of Sherlock Holmes, of course.

1468
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:35,070
No, no, no, Lestrade, I
shall not appear in this.

1469
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:37,781
To you and you alone
belongs the credit

1470
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:39,908
for this remarkable arrest.

1471
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:42,660
With your usual happy mixture

1472
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:44,829
of cunning and audacity,
you've got him.

1473
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:48,290
Got him?

1474
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:49,000
Got who?

1475
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:52,045
Why, the man who climbed the
tree in the park last night,

1476
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:53,671
Hornbeam, to be correct,

1477
01:16:53,755 --> 01:16:56,216
and shot Ronald Adair
through the open window

1478
01:16:56,299 --> 01:16:57,592
of his flat in Park Lane.

1479
01:16:57,675 --> 01:16:59,427
Has it occurred
to you, Mr. Holmes,

1480
01:17:00,345 --> 01:17:02,222
that it must be rather
difficult to climb

1481
01:17:02,305 --> 01:17:04,933
a tree and shoot anyone
when one only has one arm?

1482
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:08,144
Ah yes, yes, I'd forgotten.

1483
01:17:08,228 --> 01:17:11,231
Your left arm must be causing
you great inconvenience.

1484
01:17:11,981 --> 01:17:13,733
Lestrade, I wonder if
you'd be good enough

1485
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:15,193
to free it for the Colonel?

1486
01:17:15,276 --> 01:17:16,444
Hello, what's the game?

1487
01:17:19,823 --> 01:17:22,659
Let me introduce you to
Professor Robert Moriarty.

1488
01:17:24,494 --> 01:17:26,496
The mythical Moriarty,
my obsession.

1489
01:17:28,873 --> 01:17:31,042
I warned you when you
called upon me yesterday

1490
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:33,211
that sudden impulses
were dangerous.

1491
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:36,381
I observed that the first
molar in your left upper jaw

1492
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,842
was very badly filled with gold,

1493
01:17:39,843 --> 01:17:42,470
and when Colonel Henslowe was
feeling as if he'd lost a son,

1494
01:17:42,554 --> 01:17:45,515
I observed the same bad
workmanship in the same tooth.

1495
01:17:46,641 --> 01:17:48,059
You clever, cunning swine!

1496
01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:51,604
You think you've got
me and you're safe.

1497
01:17:51,729 --> 01:17:54,232
But you're up against
an organization, Holmes.

1498
01:17:55,608 --> 01:17:56,608
They'll get you.

1499
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:57,986
They'll destroy you.

1500
01:18:00,196 --> 01:18:01,531
I might even do it myself.

1501
01:18:10,373 --> 01:18:12,208
Take him to the
station, Lestrade.

1502
01:18:14,794 --> 01:18:17,130
I think you'll find most
of your organization

1503
01:18:17,213 --> 01:18:18,298
waiting for you there.

1504
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:19,465
Also a brand new sealing,

1505
01:18:19,549 --> 01:18:21,759
70,000 pounds of good
English bank notes.

1506
01:18:22,635 --> 01:18:23,720
Take him away.

1507
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:26,139
- We shall meet again, Mr.
- Holmes, and next time...

1508
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:28,307
Come on.

1509
01:18:32,187 --> 01:18:33,187
Are you all right?

1510
01:18:35,523 --> 01:18:37,358
I am, except my
feelings and my tie,

1511
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,195
which is entirely disorganized.

1512
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:43,281
Well, we proved our Moriarty
theory all right, Mr. Holmes.

1513
01:18:46,367 --> 01:18:47,785
It's not easy to throw dust

1514
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:49,829
in your eyes, My Dear Lestrade.

1515
01:18:50,872 --> 01:18:53,041
Doesn't do to trifle
with Scotland Yard.

1516
01:18:53,791 --> 01:18:55,543
- Quite true, Mr.
- Holmes, quite true.

1517
01:18:57,253 --> 01:18:59,130
Well now, Watson,
what about a drink?

1518
01:19:01,716 --> 01:19:02,926
You'd like one, wouldn't you?

1519
01:19:03,009 --> 01:19:04,052
- Thanks.
- Lestrade.

1520
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:13,037
I can't think how you manage

1521
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:14,896
to discover these
things, Holmes.

1522
01:19:15,313 --> 01:19:16,397
I saw nothing that could've

1523
01:19:16,481 --> 01:19:17,921
put you on the track
of the murderer.

1524
01:19:17,982 --> 01:19:19,442
On the contrary,
My Dear Watson,

1525
01:19:19,525 --> 01:19:21,694
you've seen everything,
except the tree,

1526
01:19:22,445 --> 01:19:23,363
which I told you about.

1527
01:19:23,446 --> 01:19:26,407
But you were unable to make
the necessary deductions.

1528
01:19:27,367 --> 01:19:29,661
I knew about the
existence of that air gun

1529
01:19:30,912 --> 01:19:32,872
when I found evidence
that the tree

1530
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:34,999
opposite the flat
had been climbed.

1531
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:38,169
By issuing a threat in
front of Colonel Henslowe,

1532
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,546
I made certain that in
during the 24 hours,

1533
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:43,091
he'd try to silence me
as he'd silenced Adair.

1534
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:48,388
Hence, your little
trip to Euston, Watson,

1535
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:50,890
and my placing a bust
of myself in the window,

1536
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:53,059
which Mrs. Hudson
moved occasionally

1537
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:54,852
to make it appear lifelike.

1538
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:58,773
I knew that Moriarty couldn't
resist such an opportunity.

1539
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:00,817
But what gave you
the idea, Mr. Holmes?

1540
01:20:02,026 --> 01:20:03,695
Old Colonel Henslowe himself.

1541
01:20:03,945 --> 01:20:06,030
Yes, in the conversation
I had with him,

1542
01:20:06,364 --> 01:20:08,574
the irrelevant one
about tigers, Watson.

1543
01:20:08,908 --> 01:20:10,910
"You can always tether
a goat as a bait

1544
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:14,080
"and wait till the tiger comes."

1545
01:20:15,248 --> 01:20:16,248
Of course,

1546
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:19,043
but what about the
Sleeping Cardinal?

1547
01:20:22,005 --> 01:20:24,841
Godfrey's led us straight
to the Sleeping Cardinal.

1548
01:20:25,758 --> 01:20:26,902
That's the painting in the room

1549
01:20:26,926 --> 01:20:28,511
in which you were
tied up, Watson,

1550
01:20:28,594 --> 01:20:30,805
and through which
Moriarty used to speak,

1551
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:31,973
unseen by his dupes.

1552
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,059
I have only one regret,

1553
01:20:35,435 --> 01:20:37,770
that the bust of myself
by Angelo Pelosini

1554
01:20:39,063 --> 01:20:40,815
has been irretrievably ruined.

1555
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:01,001
Really, Mr. Holmes?
