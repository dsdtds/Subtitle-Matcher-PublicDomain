1
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:40,695
The Commonwealth of Austrailia.
Land of many frontiers.

2
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:46,696
Lone stepping stone across the
vast Pacific, to the mysterious
brooding islands of the of the Malasia.

3
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:51,496
Last outpost of the art and culture
of the western world.

4
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,496
Our story takes us to
Melbourne...

5
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:59,298
Melbourne. The birthplace of Nelly
Malmer, the famous soprano...

6
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:02,498
Austrailia's gift to the American
opera.

7
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:07,499
Appearing here, as a token of
appreciation, for Melbourne's
glorious gifts are...

8
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:14,500
two distinguished concert artists,
steeped in the traditions of
American's classical music.

9
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:22,901
You ready for this?

10
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,321
There he goes. One of our best
pupils.

11
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,721
He had a tough time getting the
lead out of his feet, but there he
goes. I'll never forget. We were down in...

12
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:03,522
Don't bend the wardrobe.

13
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:05,522
Is this the bloke that popped the
question?

14
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,322
Both of them did.

15
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:11,323
- Eunice.
- Harold... oh darling, this is the
happiest day of my life.

16
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:12,723
Then why spoil it with a wedding?

17
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:16,123
But darling, I want to marry you, or
Joe.

18
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:19,124
- Oh fine, I'll be best man. See ya!
- What!

19
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,325
- Boy, have I got something cooked up for you.
- Yeah? Put it int he deep freeze.'

20
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,326
Did a similiar situation occur in
Allentown in 47?

21
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:37,926
- Thanks for the memory.
- Let's get out of here fast.

22
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,929
This'll drive them crazy, when it
doesn't come back.

23
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,329
Yeah, come on.

24
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,330
You come back here.

25
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,137
Poor man may not have his teeth in
today.

26
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,539
Gentlem, I told you. There are no
two actors travelling together on this train.

27
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,139
There's one of them.

28
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:19,140
Pilot to belly gunner, bailing out."

29
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:34,742
Wouldn't listen to me, would you?

30
00:07:35,342 --> 00:07:38,942
Let's stow away on a boat to Frisco,
I said. No, no you said. Let's hop a rattler.

31
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:43,743
- You take the uppiest and I'll take the lower.
- You had a sub-lower. Besides,
look at the money I saved you on tip boy.

32
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,343
- Get plenty of fresh air you said.
- Not me, I said.

33
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:49,944
- Hide underneath you said.
- They'll never find you. I said.

34
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:52,344
- You're going to ride inside, keep
an eye out. - I said.

35
00:07:52,944 --> 00:07:54,344
- You know what kills me?

36
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,345
You never listen to me. That's
what kills me. And where are we
now? We're lost!

37
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:03,345
- Come on, we've got some
travelling to do.
- On your feet elbow nose. Drop that beak.

38
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:07,345
The day I met you, there were
vultures in the sky. I should have
taken that for an omen.

39
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,746
They were blue birds. Now stop
worrying. I'll get you out of this.

40
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:14,147
Now look. Don't get me out of
things, stop getting me into things.
Will you?

41
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:15,946
Look Harold...

42
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:23,147
- I'll be darned... French Poodles.
- No, they are sheep. We're saved.

43
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:24,547
I don't trust you, or the sheep.

44
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:28,349
Don't you see Harold? Wherever
there are sheep, there is a farm and
where there is a farm, there is a farmer and...

45
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:30,549
.. wherever there is a farmer, there
is a farmer's daughter.

46
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,549
- Now you're getting me into trouble again.
- Come on...

47
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:35,148
Walk, don't run.

48
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,349
You know? For a couple of guys on
the lamb, we're in pretty good company.

49
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:50,351
We're poor little lambs, who've lost
our way...

50
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:05,353
- That was helpful, wasn't it?
- Fred Murray must have played through here.

51
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:28,356
- Boy am I tired of that whiff and bluff song.
- Yeah, one more whif f and bluff...

52
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,957
We may be dirty, but we're healthy.
Every time they dipped the sheep,
they dipped us.

53
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:34,957
Say... why don't we stick with them
when they get sheared too?

54
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:38,358
- I'm beginning to like it.
- What have we here?

55
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,558
Those are for argyle socks.

56
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,359
- Oh, let's get out of here.
- Here we go.

57
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
Ah, here we are.

58
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,361
Mighty attractive openings for fellas
who like work.

59
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,961
- This is for me.
- You can't cook.

60
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,562
- I can learn while you wash the dishes.
- No, no, no...

61
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:12,762
I'll cook and you wash the dishes
and you can stack them behind
your ears to dry.

62
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:15,763
- Excuse me mates.
- You just come right in.

63
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,163
Scratch and scratch.

64
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:20,963
There goes the daily double.

65
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,164
What a pity. Just when I was going
to let you have your way.

66
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:27,164
Say, I haven't looked for work since
I was night watchman at Basser.

67
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:31,765
- Yeah, that was before we grew these.
- Yes, these electric razors.
There's nothing like them.

68
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,365
- Take a mowing machine to get
these hedges knocked off.
- Remember, we on the lamb, hiding.

69
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:40,566
- How long can you hold your breath?
- My breath? Well I... you...

70
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,367
Prince Ken Irak... back again eh?

71
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,967
You must help me. I need sea divers.

72
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,367
Not a flaming chance, and you
know it.

73
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,968
Four divers shipped out to your
island already and they've never
came back.

74
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,369
Fine men too, but they met with
accidents.

75
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:05,769
Accidents my eye. We all know
about Bogaten.

76
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:07,569
Bogaten is a legend.

77
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,770
Then why don't you get your own
people to dive?

78
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,770
If Bogaten is only a blooming
legend.

79
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,370
The people of Batu are
superstitious and still believe in witchcraft.

80
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:19,171
There ain't no witchcraft down there
mate.

81
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,771
Look here Prince. You couldn't get
any diver in Austrailia to take on your job.

82
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,172
Not for all the beer in Darwin.

83
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:33,973
Well Buster, looks like the deep sea
for us.

84
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:37,573
Hop along upstairs now to complete
the necessary arrangements.

85
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,173
Why me? Why don't you go up?

86
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:43,174
No elevator. Remember you are a
much younger man than I am.

87
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,574
Who isn't. Run along now.

88
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,375
- Excuse me sir?
- Yes?

89
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:56,776
- But are you a deep sea diver?
- Well, I'm just a graduate of UCUW.

90
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,576
That's Unversity of California Under
Water.

91
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:05,577
Ooooooh... an American. Then
perhaps you would be interested in
a job that would bring you rich rewards.

92
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:07,777
Yes, of course...

93
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:13,378
... candidly rich rewards do remove a
good deal of dullness from mere work,
I guess that true. What's the pitch?

94
00:12:13,978 --> 00:12:15,178
Sunken treasure.

95
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:21,379
Treasure. Well, I'll have it up for you
in a jiffy. I must tell you one thing though.
I don't do the actual diving myself.

96
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,780
I have a boy for that. I remain on
deck and I operate the pump.

97
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,380
- Oh, but excellent.
- Your hand.

98
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,181
Yes sir, I'll have that treasure up in
two shakes of a lamb's tail. Believe
me, I know how to shake a lamb's tail.

99
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:43,982
Oh, there is one little thing I must explain.
You see, I'm not actually the diver. I'm the
top man. I have a friend who does the diving.

100
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:45,782
Is your friend experienced?

101
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:49,383
He's been underwater half of his
life. He used to be a lifeguard in a carwash.

102
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:58,784
Where is this island of yours
Prince?

103
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:02,784
A few days journey, across the sea
on the road to Bali. You will love that too.

104
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,785
- It is an island paradise.
- Girls, huh?

105
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:11,786
- Could it be a paradise without girls?
- Welcome to the club.

106
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:15,386
Oh, I must cable mother to send my
other lips.

107
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:19,387
- Boy did I make a terrific deal.
- I knew you would. You little genius you.

108
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:22,387
- Congratulations.
- It's a deal boys.

109
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:27,988
Well, these threads are a little deep
for shoving off to paradise. We
ought to slip into our lines huh?

110
00:13:28,988 --> 00:13:30,988
John will take care of your needs.
We will sail at sundown.

111
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:35,589
Sundown. Ah, that's perfect. I
freckle you know. Girls, paradise,
money... what a jackpot.

112
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:38,989
- And you did it all with your own
little... - my own little head.

113
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:56,191
- Take our luggage will you?
- Here you are.

114
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,392
Now don't get these mixed up.
Mine is blue for boy.

115
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:02,392
Hey Sam. Is that the way all the
natives dress on your island?

116
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:05,193
Really?

117
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,993
- George, do you suppose?
- Not a chance.

118
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,993
Stick around folks... he could be
wrong you know!

119
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:19,194
- Cast off.
- Who?

120
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:57,815
Isn't it beautiful?

121
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:00,414
It's the tarplan of my father's clan.

122
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:06,416
Highness your cousin, Prince
Kenarock is here.

123
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,817
I will see him alone. You girls may
leave.

124
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,018
Hey, things are picking up.

125
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:31,019
- Taste the local architecture.
- Built like brick begodas.

126
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,420
- Welcome to Batu.
- They look like Americans.

127
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
- They look like Kenarock boys.
- They're not bad.

128
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,421
Do you think they are sailors?

129
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:45,421
- They've been expecting us. They must have
got our wires. - Well, we got to ration
ourselves down here you know.

130
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:50,022
- Let's forget the box and just head for the
high country. - I don't know which way
to turn, everything looks so good.

131
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:52,822
Well don't get tied down. This may
just be the older stuff you know.

132
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:56,223
- Oh no!
- What's that?

133
00:17:57,023 --> 00:18:00,223
Eroll Flynn, he can't stand it.
Make yourselves available, huh kids?

134
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,824
Stand by, you'll hear from our local branch.
I'll sell you my suit size and everything with it.
Isn't it nice to know that we still have it.

135
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:08,824
- We got that old magic.
- That sea air must have recharged
our batteries.

136
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:13,425
- I feel like I've had a complete overhaul.
- Yeah, and if we can get our
speedometers turned back, we're in business.

137
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:16,225
Don't look now, but Abu and his
brother are still with us.

138
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,226
Don't worry about them. Let them
get their own girls.

139
00:18:18,626 --> 00:18:19,626
I wonder if they massage?

140
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:22,026
Too bad my prayers were not
answered.

141
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:24,626
- Prayers? For me?
- Yes!

142
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:26,627
That you be washed overboard.

143
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:32,627
Despite your prayers, I managed to
obtain some excellent diving equipment...

144
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:36,028
and two american divers. I think
our plan...

145
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:41,229
Our plan? I want no part of it.
Your two americans will die like all
the others.

146
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,629
It's just cold-blooded murder.

147
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:50,030
- How about those chicks huh?
- Steady, steady now. Remember Austrailia.

148
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,230
All that trouble.

149
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes, we're not going to get involved
with girls again. Remember?

150
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,831
- Well...
- Well...

151
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:03,031
Well...

152
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:04,632
Your turn.

153
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:09,032
Your Highness, may I present our
guests.

154
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:10,632
Your Highness!

155
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:15,033
Gentlemen, you are in the presence
of my cousin, Princess Lala.

156
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,633
Well the name is Bridley, Princess.
Harold Bridley.

157
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:22,034
Sportsman, racketure, polo player
and all-around good egg.

158
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,034
Welcome to Batu gentlemen.

159
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:26,034
George Cockran at your service
Your Highness.

160
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:31,435
- Continental?
- Oh go run and play with the
peasants. I'll take care of Your Royal Highness.

161
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:36,236
- Do you always fight over girls?
- Well what else is there to fight over?

162
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:37,636
We've never had any money.

163
00:19:39,236 --> 00:19:40,636
That's for Washington.

164
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:45,637
Now let's be fair, be fair Leroy. If
you can't pay, you do time.

165
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:47,637
Follow me gentlemen.

166
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:49,237
We're coming.

167
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,038
They have become friendly.

168
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,039
- That is a bad omen.
- Omens are for old women.

169
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,039
Sharks will soon be picking their
bones.

170
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,040
This kid carries her own antenna.

171
00:20:14,641 --> 00:20:18,641
- Man, this is quite a quonset.
- Amazing what you can do with a G-I loan.

172
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,242
They must have gambling here.

173
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:25,242
She was my mother. Queen
Tomma of Batu.

174
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,442
- Beautiful.
- And he was my father.

175
00:20:30,043 --> 00:20:31,643
Didn't anybody in the family wear
the pants?

176
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:35,243
Colorful old chap, wasn't he? He
must have gotten around some.

177
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:40,244
Father sailed a merchant ship that
docked here. He liked the island,
met mother and remained.

178
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,644
- I'd like to remain her myself.
- You're reading my mind.

179
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,245
- You're the one that always wants
to go home. - I'm home!

180
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,445
- Something wrong Princess?

181
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:53,046
You must be very tired after your
voyage. You must rest before...

182
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:56,846
- Before what?
- Before tonight. I'm having a feast in your honor.

183
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:01,047
- Run out to the car and get my
finger bowl, huh?
- Will you need your chopsticks?

184
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,847
- Just my fork and a pusher.
- I may join you... l think you'll...

185
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:07,848
Hey, not bad without a reservation huh?

186
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:12,848
- Rest well. I will see you tonight.
- Leave a call or we'll call you later.

187
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:13,848
Here! Here!

188
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:15,849
Don't over match yourself old man.

189
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,049
- We may get a little rain later.
- Oh bug that.

190
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:24,050
- Gee, what a spot this is.
- Isn't this lush.

191
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,050
Would you like me to shoot you a
squirrel before your nap sir?

192
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,251
- Lou wouldn't do that Daniel Boone.
- I might knock off a rodent.

193
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:32,651
This'll do for me George, this will do it.

194
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,651
- Good night all.
- Hey, get your shoes off. You're in
a palace.

195
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:37,251
I've always wanted to play at a
palace.

196
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,852
Draw the blinds pal. It's siesta time
for Sophie.

197
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:40,852
Very well sir.

198
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:45,853
- Man, I could spend the rest of my
life in a joint like this.
- You say that everytime you get in a bed.

199
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:49,253
I'm in a haze. That Lala intoxicates me.

200
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:54,054
- Could be. She's half scotch.
- Yeah, and me for a chaser.

201
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:56,454
Just don't get another hangover.

202
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:58,654
Freedom.

203
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:04,055
I'd better get some black polish.
This may be formal tonight.

204
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:37,675
Say Hagas? What is it McBagas? Have you
heard the latest about McTavish? What's he
done now? He's living on the roof.

205
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:42,276
- Why would he be living on the roof?
- He heard someone say the "drinks
were on the house".

206
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:47,076
The drinks are on the house. You
know what we...

207
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:35,483
Thanks. You're a pal. Not mine,
but you're a pal.

208
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:40,283
- Sit here. Are you kidding.
- He takes that large economy size.

209
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:44,884
Next week it's my turn to wear the girdle.
- Why don't you entertain us a little.
Why don't you do your disappearing act.

210
00:25:45,484 --> 00:25:49,284
Oh, I know that one. You mean the
hindu rope trick.

211
00:25:57,485 --> 00:26:00,486
I'm sure you've heard of it. As a
matter of fact, it's impossible.

212
00:26:01,286 --> 00:26:04,086
This must be the one, where they
throw the rope up in the air, climb
up and disappear.

213
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:07,887
- It's nothing. It's sort of a mass hypnosis.
- Where did you learn words like that?

214
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,887
This kid was drummed out of
kindergarten for cheating on fingerpainting.

215
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:13,688
- I was framed.
- Now watch!

216
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:23,689
What else it new?

217
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,091
Watch it governor, I think this calls
for me.

218
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:44,492
Here, here. I'll be in the balcony.

219
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:54,893
I've heard about vanishing
cream... but vanishing blubber.

220
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:57,493
Fight him off Princess. Here comes
Jack of the Beanstalk.

221
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:01,494
Down boy, down boy.

222
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:14,295
How's the beast in the penthouse?

223
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,896
- Ah, space cadet returns.
- Did you get my card Jacques?

224
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:22,096
I had a wonderful time, I'm glad you
were here.

225
00:27:22,697 --> 00:27:25,497
- Very funny. It's easy for you to get up there.
- Oh come on... it's mass hypnosis.

226
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:29,497
Mass hypnosis, you're full of
helium. Say how about a little black
magic for me Princess?

227
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,298
Here's an exciting bit of hokus pokus.

228
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:35,298
- If a cobra comes out of there, it's yours.
- I'll split it with you.

229
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:38,499
Pay your dues.

230
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:16,103
- I wouldn't believe it if I saw it.
- I saw it and I wouldn't believe it.

231
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,305
I'm starting to believe it.

232
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:02,710
In scout camp they had basket
weaving and I took up wood-working.

233
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,910
Give me the pipe. I'm going into
business for myself.

234
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,911
I'll check with you in a fortnight.
- He's always eager to improve himself...

235
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:19,912
always trying to pick up something new.
What about you and I seeking out some
dale where you and I can discuss...

236
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:34,514
- George, I must talk to you and Harold.
- Oh forget about Harold. He's a
hustler, a philanderer.

237
00:29:35,514 --> 00:29:41,315
Let me tell you something. He ran
out on a very lovely girl down in
Austrailia. And on their wedding day too.

238
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:45,515
- I think he's attractive.
- I can't hear you. Not reaching me at all.

239
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:48,115
- I think you're attractive too.
- Contact.

240
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:55,516
Actually, as a matter of fact, there's nothing special
about me. I'm just an average, all-around american
boy with an excess of charm.

241
00:29:56,317 --> 00:30:00,117
- Harold told me that too.
- About me? About him. So
conceited that man.

242
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:07,318
Delightful place you have here
Princess. It'd be lovely just to lay
around here and grow old.

243
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:12,719
George! You and Harold will never
grow old, unless you escape at once.

244
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:19,120
- Escape? My cousin Kenarock is a scheming
murderer. - He's a very nice guy. A little
formal, a little cold perhaps...

245
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,720
You do not know him. He has sent
many men to their death, at sea.

246
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,521
- Physical too huh?
- Kenarock will let nothing stand in
his way of ambition.

247
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:33,121
Years ago my father set out for Bali
to sell a valuable chest of jewels...

248
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:36,722
. the boat sank on a reef outside of
our lagoon...

249
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:40,122
neither my father nor the jewels
have ever been recovered.

250
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:44,723
That's the treasure they want us to
haul out of the sea, huh?

251
00:30:44,923 --> 00:30:47,323
Many have tried, but none have
succeeded.

252
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:50,924
- They offered us 50,000 gilda to get it.
- You must escape tonight!

253
00:30:51,524 --> 00:30:54,924
No Princess. You're looking at a big
gilder man.
- You must go, I tell you.

254
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:58,325
- Down in the wreck of the boat
lives... Bogatan
- Boga who?

255
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,925
- Bogatan, a giant squid.
- Let him live a little.

256
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:07,726
This squid is a terror. He's an
enormous monster, with bone-
crushing tentacles, a man-eater.

257
00:31:08,326 --> 00:31:13,527
- It means certain death to the diver.
- Certain death to the diver huh?

258
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:18,327
- Harold laughs at death.
- We must warn him, tell him about Bogatan.

259
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,928
I don't know. I may have some
trouble talking him out of this. He
loves a challenge this boy.

260
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,328
Death is his bread, danger his
butter.

261
00:31:25,128 --> 00:31:27,728
- You've got to convince him.
- You've got to butter him up good.

262
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,531
- Where can he be? What can he be doing?

263
00:31:55,532 --> 00:31:58,132
Hootwha, oh what a hoot.

264
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:03,133
- What a business! I finally learned
that trick.
- Who ran second? Well, I was...

265
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:07,934
I've been playing this flute all night.
Georgette, stash that in the icebox,
will you please?

266
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:12,934
- Thank you Zza Zza. Listen, don't
you ever disappear like that on me again.

267
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:17,335
- I was worried into a postive tizzy about you.
- You worry? Yes I was. About me?
Certainly!

268
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:21,335
- Yes I was. About me? Certainly!
268. Well bless your big fat
motherly heart. What's to worry?

269
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:26,736
Well in spite of everything I had to
say, I put in plenty of knocks... that
palpitating Princess is all in a twiter over you.

270
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:30,137
- Me? Really?
- Yes!

271
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:37,938
- This girl is not only charming, she's intelligent.
- You'd better be careful boy, she'll
marry you and make you a prince.

272
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:44,539
You'll spend the rest of your miserable life just
lolling around, munching mangoes, falling apart
and having girls wait on you and stuff like that.

273
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:49,739
- I can't let this happen to you.
- You're all I've got. I'll buy you a dog.

274
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:52,340
Destiny calls the young Prince.

275
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,140
- Surely you can't want this?
- Well, it's a living.

276
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,141
Okay pal. I won't stand in your way.
I guess after all, I blew it. I goofed.
I told her what a hero you are.

277
00:33:10,742 --> 00:33:12,742
Boy, what a relief.

278
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:17,543
Just think, tomorrow at dawn, you'll
be coming up out of the water with the treasure.

279
00:33:18,343 --> 00:33:22,343
- Have a big suptious wedding.
Yeah dancing girls, coconut
frappes, music...

280
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:29,544
- Hey, how I'm I coming up with the treasure?
- Because you're going down for it.

281
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:31,545
- Oh I see...

282
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:37,745
Wait a minute! Not me! No I even
get the bends when I'm ducking for apples.

283
00:33:38,546 --> 00:33:41,546
- You're the diver?
- I'm the diver? Yeah, you're the diver.

284
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:47,547
Oh Harold! You don't know what this means
to mean. This is the nicest thing you've ever
done. Letting me be Lala's number one boy.

285
00:33:48,547 --> 00:33:53,146
- Well this changes everything.
- I thought I was Lala's boy?

286
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:58,548
But you resigned. It's all mine now.
I go down a pauper and come up a Prince.

287
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:06,148
- No, no. If that's the way it's going
to be, I'm going to be dunked.
- Oh no, no. It's too dangerous.

288
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:08,349
I laugh at danger.

289
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,150
Okay, if you insist. You get the
jewels, you get the Princess.

290
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,150
Good-night.

291
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:24,552
I get the jewels, I get the Princess
and I couldn't happen to a nicer girl.

292
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:50,363
Harold... Harold...

293
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:58,764
Look don't fool with the fun fl ute
unless you check with the master.

294
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:07,565
Gentlemen... it is time.

295
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:12,366
My Princess is impatient. Valdimir,
lay out my top hat, white tie and swim fins.

296
00:36:13,366 --> 00:36:14,166
Very good sir.

297
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:30,968
- Harold, are you sure you know
what you're doing?
- Do I know what I'm doing, you lucky girl!

298
00:36:31,768 --> 00:36:34,368
- So George told you.
- Exhale a little bit, I want to slip
this over your head.

299
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:38,569
Say you haven't got anything in
straw, with a wider brim and a long
oval have you? No you wouldn't have that.

300
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:41,169
Just try it on for size. Any size will
do. This kid's head is a little pointy.

301
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:45,570
He takes anything from a 3 to a size
8. Suck in your nose dear.

302
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,971
- There we are. Oh, there you are.
I'd ask you in, but it's a little crowded in here.

303
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:53,771
- How can you two joke.
- Oh it's easy when you are brave.

304
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:56,171
- Oh he's plenty brave, this fellow.
- I take brave pills.

305
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,772
Tell her about the time at Catilina
when I got the big barge off the
bottom... oh was she heavy.

306
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:02,972
- Oh, but a lovely girl.
- Yeah, she was a big...

307
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:07,373
Here Anette, you may want to do
your nails down there. Thanks, he
usually sticks it in my back you know.

308
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:11,573
- ake two, we're having a one-set sale.
- Don't forget my Roy Rogers water pistol.

309
00:37:11,973 --> 00:37:14,174
- Want to take a plumber's helper
down with you?
- No, I work alone you know.

310
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,774
- Before you go down, I want you to think again...
- No, no, no. No time to start
thinking, he going to start sinking.

311
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,575
How about a kiss for your hero, just
for luck huh?

312
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,375
- Sorry madame, next window please.
- Remind him of Bogaten.

313
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:28,976
- Oh well, Bogaten.
- Bogaten...

314
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:33,576
Hey, where's he running. Just a
second. Lean in here will you?

315
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,977
- Oh you should have thought of that before
- Oh you should have thought of that before

316
00:37:41,777 --> 00:37:44,578
Oh no, we can't go through that
again. If your wool underwear
starts to itch, it will just have to itch.

317
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:48,178
- Well get me another pair of hands for inside.
- Oh, I thought you worked alone.
Oh, but this is different.

318
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,980
- Should've put some water in the radiator.
- We could have made a cup of tea.

319
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,180
That is enough. Over the side.
Come!

320
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:10,781
- Thanks pal. I'll bring you back
some saltwater taffy.

321
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:13,981
- Tie it tight sugar.
- Say write if you fi nd work, will you?

322
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:16,982
- Geronimo!
- We're gone.

323
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:13,789
- Hey, I've got it.
- Yeah, what?

324
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:18,390
- The treasure. Brown wooden box,
brass handles, big lock.
- Yes, that's it George.

325
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,790
- Come on, come on. Grag the loot and scoot.
- Drop me a hook boy.

326
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,591
Lower the line and stand by.

327
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:23,398
- What is it? What's the matter buster?
- Bogaten, it can only be Bogaten.

328
00:40:24,398 --> 00:40:26,399
Hey, never mind that treasure, pull
my pal up.

329
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,199
We haven't got time now. Back to
the pump. Come on we'll pull him
to the surface.

330
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:44,401
- Get it up close now, so I can grab
him.

331
00:40:47,001 --> 00:40:50,002
Easy now. Easy does it. Here he comes.

332
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:59,803
Hey buster, you Okay? Exhale a
little. Exhale just once.

333
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:06,004
- Buster, hey buster.
- George! Look out!

334
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:27,007
He's not in there.

335
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:30,207
Witchman!

336
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:38,808
Obviously Bogaten has claimed the
American. Now Lala, it is time to
feed the sharks.

337
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:43,209
- Put down that gun!
- Your days of telling me what to do are over.

338
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:48,009
Without you, I have the island, the
jewels, everything!

339
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,410
For this moment, I have waited all
my life.

340
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,010
You try to put the finger on us boy
and you'll have a lot of trouble with
your breathing.

341
00:42:10,012 --> 00:42:12,013
- Who's there.
- I'm just closing the gate.-

342
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,813
- Slap happy this boy.
Now he worries about me.

343
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,213
- We're proud of you.
- We thought you were gone.

344
00:42:18,813 --> 00:42:22,614
- Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep.
- Good thing he's a coward huh?
He's wonderful.

345
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:27,415
- Oh, it was nothing. I had him in a
headlock, but he hit me with an ink bottle.

346
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:30,415
Hey look.

347
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:37,216
We can not go back to Batu. He
will have our throats cut.

348
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:41,016
- Oh, that would hurt my high notes.
- Might help, we could sing duets.

349
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:45,817
We must go on to Bali. There we
can sell the jewels. We must sail at once.

350
00:42:46,217 --> 00:42:49,817
- I'll pack. Hey wait a minute.
- I want to ask you something.

351
00:42:50,418 --> 00:42:53,418
- How did you get out of that suit?
- Out of the diving suit? Well it was easy...

352
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:55,618
I was down at the bottom and I...

353
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:38,424
- Think, this stuff is real.
- Yeah, and it's worth millions
George, millions!

354
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:42,024
- Looks like Ali Caan's garbage can.
- Yeah, the top layer.

355
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:45,625
- I think I'll have cuff links made out of these.
- Do you think this is too much?

356
00:43:46,425 --> 00:43:49,625
- No, I think that'll work.
- Well you know, if you wear it right.

357
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:55,626
Oh Lala's all mine. What a parle huh? You
know the first thing I'm going to do when
I become Prince is pass a community property law.

358
00:43:56,426 --> 00:44:00,227
- That cuts me in right away.
- What line what form.

359
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:04,827
- Fantastic.
- Let me put this under canvass.
Let me see this.

360
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:08,628
Hey...

361
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:13,828
- Shame on you. You're a grown man.
- Well, she's a grown girl.

362
00:44:14,629 --> 00:44:17,429
- I wonder where you grow this stuff.
- If you find out, give me a call.

363
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:22,029
- I'll be topside. I've got to take my
turn at the wheel.
- Slow down, back, back, back.

364
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:26,630
- Gee, you're pretty alert aren't you? - More than
you know. I've got these counted you know.
Really? One, two, three, four...

365
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,231
- Well, I'll see you.
- Whoa, whoa, check it out.

366
00:44:31,031 --> 00:44:33,631
- How did that get in there, I
wonder? These are not vitamin pills you know.

367
00:44:40,232 --> 00:44:42,432
How did my school teacher get in
there.

368
00:44:52,033 --> 00:44:54,034
- Take this on a weekend.

369
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:58,834
He's going to sing folks. Now's the
time to go out and get the popcorn.

370
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:22,853
Only two more of these sliverly
nights, and we'll be in Bali.

371
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:27,454
- I kind of hate to think of leaving you Lala.
- You mustn't think of it, because
you mustn't do it.

372
00:47:28,254 --> 00:47:33,454
I've been away a long, long time.
I've got to get back. Catch some
ball games, see how the Pirates are doing.

373
00:47:35,655 --> 00:47:39,455
- You still have pirates in America?
- Yeah, but they are nothing to be
afraid of. Probably hiding in the cellar someplace.

374
00:47:41,255 --> 00:47:45,256
It's a fantastic place, the U.S.A. Lala. Take a town,
take any town, like the garden spot of North
America.

375
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:49,857
Lush, picturesque riveria of the
middle west.

376
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:54,457
- For example, Toledo, Ohio.
- Toledo, Ohio...

377
00:47:56,457 --> 00:48:00,458
- Oh it sounds beautiful. Such a musical name.
- Oh it's a music town, a jukebox in
every bowling alley.

378
00:48:03,058 --> 00:48:08,259
- Lala? Will you go to America with
me? George! I mean marry me
and go to America with me.

379
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:12,660
- Oh it would be wonderful, but what
about Harold?

380
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
- We could adopt him.
- Adopt him?

381
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,260
- Of course we'd have to send him
away to school.
- Little late for that, isn't it?

382
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,461
- Oh no baby. He's gotta go sometime
you know. - That's enough! Why you
collapsible como you!

383
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:28,262
- You and your "Pirates".
- At least they're in the major league.

384
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:31,262
- That's so underhanded.
- That's gratitude for you.

385
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:34,262
I try to plan your education and you
turn on me like a mad dog.

386
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:39,663
I wish I were a mad dog. I'd give
you the sniffer. Don't plan my
education. I'm illiterate enough now.

387
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:44,464
- Listen Lala, if you're going
anywhere, you're going with me.
- Oh no she's not.

388
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:48,264
- I don't know what to do.
- George, shouldn't you go beddy-bye?

389
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:52,865
Beddy-bye? And leave you here with
this Malinese pound cake? Lala, you've
got to make up your mind, and right now.

390
00:48:53,465 --> 00:48:57,265
Oh, that's not way to talk to your
mother. Listen Mom.
- It's Lala, Lala, not Mama.

391
00:48:57,865 --> 00:49:00,066
You promised to marry me if I got
the treasure, didn't you?

392
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:04,266
- What! She didn't promise you, I did.
- You know what a liar I am. Oh,
so that's it?

393
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:08,867
You're up here pitching with this
doll, while I'm down there adlibing
with that deep-sea claw machine.

394
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:12,467
- Harold, Harold... I do love you.
- Oh, I thought so.

395
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:17,068
- But I love George too.
- Well, if you like the other
generation, they're restful.

396
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:19,668
- I'm so confused...

397
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:22,869
I love you for what you are.
- A liar.

398
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:28,869
I love Harold for what he was.
Sometime. Somewhere.

399
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,470
- The kid's gone. She's in sections.
- We'd better get to the bottom of this.

400
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:38,871
- Yeah, let's get to the bottom of this.
- What was I? Where? When? Probably
some agonizing episode from her childhood.

401
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:42,671
We'll have to probe the
subconscience with a little psychology.

402
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,272
Lie down dear. Lie down. Easy.

403
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:52,673
- Are you comfy?
- Yes doctor.

404
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:59,073
- There's a lot of quack in this boy. Now Lala.
- We want to delve into your past.
Way back into your childhood.

405
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:09,075
Well, when I got to be 6 or 7,
I remember I was terribly lonely...

406
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:15,676
I had no one to play with, until one
day my father brought me a little companion.

407
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:20,476
Come Sandy. Come play with me.
Please Sandy.

408
00:50:42,279 --> 00:50:45,279
- Sandy...
- Not me, you've got the wrong monkey.

409
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,880
Well, I'll leave it up to you Lala. Do
you want me for who I am...

410
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,280
or do you want this chump for the
chimp he used to be?

411
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,681
- Kick it around a while. I'm going
downstairs to peel buster a banana.
- Play with your mice while you are there.

412
00:50:55,481 --> 00:51:00,882
- Say now that the imposter's gone, why don't
we... - Harold, the wheel. You'd better
take it. These are dangerous waters.

413
00:51:01,482 --> 00:51:05,482
- Coral wreaths, racing currents.
- But baby I've got racing currents of my own.

414
00:51:07,882 --> 00:51:08,883
Check!

415
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:15,883
- You and George certainly are romantic.
- George? I use him for a warm-up boy.

416
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:20,484
Send him ahead on all these situations.
But speaking of lardhead, how did you
like his singing?

417
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:24,885
- Oh, it was beautiful.
- Princess I've got news for you. He
can't sing a note.

418
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:29,685
I do all the singing. He just mouths
a little.

419
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:35,086
He's part of my warm-up. And I've
got to sing slow because if he
mouths too fast, his plate starts to slip.

420
00:51:35,686 --> 00:51:39,287
You see, I'm a ventriloquist. That's
part of our act. I'll show you.

421
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:41,687
- How are you down there?
- Fine. How are you?

422
00:51:42,487 --> 00:51:44,687
- You see...
- Harold, the wheel.

423
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:14,291
- Harold!
- Hornblow... Horatio... come on
Captian Hornblow. Captain?

424
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:18,092
What have we got here?

425
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:22,692
He always did gulp his food, you
know. We may get his appendix
her in a minute.

426
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:33,094
Aha! One of the bobbles. I think
we should have this lad floroscoped.

427
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:37,694
- Are you all right?
- What happened? Is the picture over?

428
00:52:38,094 --> 00:52:42,295
- You're fine now, you're all right.
Just relax - There must be a
village on this island somewhere.

429
00:52:42,895 --> 00:52:44,695
You think so? We can buy another
boat and go on to Bali.

430
00:52:48,095 --> 00:52:51,896
- Say, that's a real crazy anthill.
- They've got a hotel with hot and
cold running lava.

431
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:56,297
Look... a bottle.

432
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,898
- Hey, hey look. There's a message in it.
- What does it say?

433
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:12,099
It says: "Return this bottle to Sam's
Supermarket for 3 cents deposit."

434
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:15,099
Isn't it a pity. Every movie has got
to have a message.

435
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:18,299
Let's get out of this bunker huh?

436
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
We'll go this way.

437
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:47,903
- Hold it, hold it.
- What? Just a minute.

438
00:53:48,503 --> 00:53:53,104
I haven't been smacked in the face
this much since my first rumbleseat.

439
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:55,504
- Let's change places.
- Push on Princess.

440
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:03,505
Whoa, whoa. Something wrong
here. Look, let me go ahead.

441
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:06,106
I'll break the trail, before it breaks me.

442
00:54:06,706 --> 00:54:08,506
Lead on Livingston.

443
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:20,908
- Say, isn't he breaking trail a little high.
An animal snare. - Now we know there
are people on this island.

444
00:54:21,308 --> 00:54:23,308
Hey, there's people up here too.

445
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:27,708
- I wonder what the locals are like?
- I hope they're not cannibales or headhunters.

446
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,509
I hope they're orange pickers.
I want to get off this tree.

447
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:36,110
- Oh stop squawking.
- You'll fall off when you are ripe.
I feel like a windsock.

448
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:41,910
- Hey, where are you going.
- Quiet, somebody is coming.

449
00:54:46,511 --> 00:54:48,511
Hi. Hi. Go ahead.

450
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:53,312
- Thank you.
- Okay.

451
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:01,113
Who was that? That's my brother
Bob. I promised him a shot in the picture.

452
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:04,313
- He's handsome.
- It's a family characteristic.

453
00:55:05,113 --> 00:55:07,714
Help! Get me down! My brain is
rushing to my head.

454
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:11,914
- Harold?
- Oh yeah, the dangler. Let's get
the sap out of the tree.

455
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:16,915
- This is the sloppiest hanging I've
ever attended. -ou're saved.
A pardon just came from the Governor.

456
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:22,116
- Easy now. Steady.
- Say, wish I had a shot of this for
the Tuna club now.

457
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:25,916
Upsidaisy, let's get him up. Be
careful now.

458
00:55:27,516 --> 00:55:29,917
Oh, I'll never say bottoms-up again.

459
00:55:30,317 --> 00:55:33,517
You got me down just in time. I was
getting tan in the wrong places.

460
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:36,717
Put your weight on this tree and
hold it. I'll cut the palm. Are you all right?

461
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:41,118
I'm fi ne. The blood is coming back
to my toes. Now if I could get my
toes back to my feet.

462
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:43,118
Your sinuses are up-dated.

463
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:48,719
Where did he go now? Oh this boy
loves to travel. Come on, we'll
bring him a band-aid.

464
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,720
- Harold?
- This way nurse. And bring my toy boats.

465
00:56:01,121 --> 00:56:03,121
- Harooold?
- Over here!

466
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:07,321
Look.

467
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:13,722
- Buster! Come on out of there.
- Not me, I'm staying out here
where it's safe.

468
00:56:14,322 --> 00:56:17,323
Hurry now, get out of there. Look in
back of you!

469
00:56:24,324 --> 00:56:26,724
I got you, I got you. Yeah, but he
got ahold of me!

470
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:33,125
Hey, I feel a breeze. A breeze?

471
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:37,725
Well, I'll be darned. Colored
television, widescreen too...

472
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,926
Really? Am I there? Just your
best angle. Wish I had my rearview mirror.

473
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:43,526
Look!

474
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:47,727
The African Queen.

475
00:56:49,727 --> 00:56:54,328
Humpfrey Bogard...
Boy is he lost!

476
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:57,328
Hey Bogie...?

477
00:57:00,528 --> 00:57:04,529
Hey, jungle fever. That's what we
got. That was just a mirage.

478
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:07,329
Yeah, well what about this.
Humphrey's academy award.

479
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:10,730
An Oscar. Give me that, you've got
one.

480
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:16,330
Friends... this is a great occasioin,
me receiving this academy award...

481
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:18,331
And I'd like to say a word...

482
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:22,531
Run! That's the word.

483
00:57:28,932 --> 00:57:33,733
- Well, what've we got here? A jungle motel?
- It's a little south for a Brown Derby isn't it?

484
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:38,333
Hello, anybody home? I'm a
member of the automobile club.

485
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:42,534
- This is cold. There's been nobody
here for some time.
- We can spend the night here.

486
00:57:43,734 --> 00:57:47,735
Yeah, I'll go sign the register.
Princess Lala, the Honorable
George Cockran and man servant.

487
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:52,135
- Hey, I found a gun.
- So we heard.

488
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:56,336
- Oh, that's wonderful. Now one of
you can go out and hunt for food.
- Oh so right Lala.

489
00:57:56,736 --> 00:57:59,736
Say here Annie Oakley. Run out
and shoot us a filet mignon,
medium rare huh?

490
00:58:00,136 --> 00:58:03,937
- Don't hurry. Wait a minute.
- You're the sharp shooter.

491
00:58:04,737 --> 00:58:07,337
This boy played second shotgun
with the Spike Jones band.

492
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:09,937
Not me, the last thing I shot was
two sixes.

493
00:58:10,338 --> 00:58:12,538
Please, will one of you go out and
hunt for food before it gets too dark.

494
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:15,338
Okay, here's what we do. The
winner stays here with Lala.

495
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,740
Damn, those republicans are
everywhere.
- That's the junior branch.

496
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:12,346
- Harold?
- Couldn't sleep huh?

497
00:59:12,746 --> 00:59:15,546
- No.
- Neither could I and for the same reason.

498
00:59:17,746 --> 00:59:19,947
May I sit down?

499
00:59:20,947 --> 00:59:24,747
Little chilly isn't it? You need
something around you. Preferably me.

500
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:31,148
- Oh, this is so peaceful.
- Yeah, it's what I've always wanted.

501
00:59:31,548 --> 00:59:36,349
Fireside, home, backyard with
flowers, a vegetable garden.

502
00:59:36,749 --> 00:59:39,149
A couple of oil wells.

503
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:43,550
A home. That's what every girl
dreams of.

504
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,950
I'll make your dreams come true then.

505
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:51,351
- What about George?
- Well, we can always make him our
babysitter.

506
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:55,951
Of course we'd have to lock up the liquor.
- Shall we build up the fire?

507
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:59,152
I'm in flames now, Lala.

508
01:00:03,752 --> 01:00:07,553
- Life girl.
- I never knew love could be such a problem.

509
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:11,953
- What's the problem?
Auntie M, our chaperon is asleep in there.

510
01:00:13,354 --> 01:00:17,154
- What do we do when we get to Bali.
- You're going to marry me, naturally.

511
01:00:17,554 --> 01:00:18,754
Aren't you?

512
01:00:20,955 --> 01:00:24,755
- Well, I...
- Yes?

513
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:28,956
No?

514
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:50,966
Dumbo? Why do you cut into my
scene?

515
01:01:51,366 --> 01:01:55,167
- I'm singing
- You'll never go any place with your
singing. You can't even cry.

516
01:01:55,567 --> 01:01:57,967
- I may have a nervous breakdown in this spot.
- Have one up in the tree will ya?

517
01:01:58,367 --> 01:01:59,767
Yes, I'll say hello to your relatives.

518
01:05:13,393 --> 01:05:16,193
- Harold! George! Get up! Quick!
- What's the matter? Is the bus leaving?

519
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,194
Look out...

520
01:05:45,797 --> 01:05:48,797
It's a female gorilla. It must be the
dead one's mate.

521
01:05:54,398 --> 01:05:56,598
The winner and new champion.

522
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:01,599
- I'd better put out the cat.
- That guns no good. No.

523
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:03,399
No? Watch this!

524
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:05,800
Where did it go?

525
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:20,201
We may as well relax. We could be
here all night.

526
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,402
- Yeah, let's dig in.
- Call the command post huh?

527
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:42,804
Hey, wake up. She's not here.
Lala is gone

528
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:46,005
- Maybe some dirty rat kidnapped her?
- Oh, couldn't be. We're both here.

529
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:35,411
- Boy, isn't that a beautiful picture?
- Yeah, when does the tide go out?

530
01:08:19,817 --> 01:08:23,618
- How come we don't fall.
- Paramount wouldn't dare. At your age!

531
01:08:25,218 --> 01:08:27,218
Shall we then? Inhale.

532
01:08:36,018 --> 01:08:38,219
- Hey, come on out of there.
- Yeah, time's a wasting.

533
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:43,620
- I'll see you back at the hut.
- Oh no. We couldn't leave a poor
defenceless girl like you out in the jungle.

534
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:46,620
You need two defenceless men to
protect you.

535
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:47,620
Speak for yourself.

536
01:08:49,021 --> 01:08:51,421
- All right. Turn your heads.

537
01:08:53,221 --> 01:08:55,022
Selfish!

538
01:08:57,422 --> 01:09:01,222
- My hair ribbon is gone.
- Hair ribbon? What about your wrap?

539
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:05,423
- You stay there while I get dressed.
- "What about your wrap." That's nice talk.

540
01:09:05,823 --> 01:09:08,423
- I was just asking.
- Cover up your eyes, like she said.

541
01:09:08,823 --> 01:09:12,624
You never want to have any kind of
fun. That's my type of girl, the
atheletic type.

542
01:09:13,223 --> 01:09:18,424
- When the right type of girl comes along, you'll
be swept off your feet. - My type of girl is right
back there, I want to tell you that.

543
01:09:19,424 --> 01:09:23,424
I know all about swimming. I used
to grease them for the channel swim.

544
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:25,226
Plenty of boy left over.

545
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:30,426
Oh George. Come on, cut it out will
you? Quit kidding.

546
01:09:32,026 --> 01:09:34,227
Hey, hey help! GEORGE!

547
01:09:35,227 --> 01:09:37,627
Oh Harold, you pick up with the
darnest people.

548
01:09:38,227 --> 01:09:39,627
Harold...

549
01:09:40,027 --> 01:09:43,828
George! George, where'd you go?
- Buster, don't get excited now.

550
01:09:44,428 --> 01:09:48,629
Play it real cool. Don't antagonize
her. That's the dead gorilla's mate, buster.

551
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:51,428
What does she want? Revenge?

552
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:53,228
No, no I'm afraid not.

553
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:56,830
- Hurry George, this kid's a
junvenille deliquent.
- Keep cool!

554
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,630
- Keep it cool? I'm numb!
- I'll think of something.

555
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,430
- George!
- Keep it cool!

556
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,631
- Why am I attractive to young widows?
- I don't like the look in her eyes.

557
01:10:07,631 --> 01:10:11,432
Get a rock, a club, anything. Kill
one of us! - Okay..

558
01:10:15,232 --> 01:10:19,033
Sing to her. You know, music has
charm to soothe the savage beast.

559
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,233
Breast, that is. BEAST, BREAST,
JUST SING!

560
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:35,435
Down baby. Down girl. I've got a
broken...

561
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:38,835
Soothe her, soothe her! SING!

562
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:47,236
Keep singing, and if you get tired,
call Gary.

563
01:10:48,436 --> 01:10:53,237
Help! Help! Harold, George, help!
- They're after me.

564
01:10:53,637 --> 01:10:54,837
- Who?
- The natives!

565
01:10:55,237 --> 01:10:59,038
Get the jewels and run! Keep
working. The natives are here. SING!

566
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:03,838
- I'm singing.
- Didn't I tell you to sing! Go, go.

567
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,839
Mosquitoes. A rear guard action.

568
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,440
- It's a poison dart.
- What? Call an ambulance, I'm wounded.

569
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,441
- They got you hun? Tell me this is
only a vitamin shot honey.
- This is a doctor G.

570
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:26,441
It won't kill you. It will just cause
muscular convulsions and then a coma.

571
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:29,642
Doctor G means: The Laughing Twitch.

572
01:11:38,243 --> 01:11:40,843
Go sit in the audience if you're
going to laugh like that...

573
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:31,450
- I wish I was the little pig that stayed home.
- Don't worry until they put an apple
in your mouth, then you're in trouble.

574
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:46,652
- What's this kid?
- How many times have I told you,
don't play with your food.

575
01:12:47,252 --> 01:12:49,052
- Don't play with the... FOOD?

576
01:12:52,053 --> 01:12:54,453
Vermon! Crawling maggots!

577
01:12:58,453 --> 01:13:01,854
Say, did you hear that kid's mother?
Those cats are cannibals.

578
01:13:02,254 --> 01:13:04,854
- Maybe they're only headhunters.
- ONLY headhunters!

579
01:13:05,454 --> 01:13:07,455
This is the only head I've got. I'm
very attached to it.

580
01:13:07,855 --> 01:13:11,855
- Do you mean they throw the rest away?
- Right now I wish I were back with
that sweet lovely gorilla.

581
01:13:12,055 --> 01:13:14,255
I'm carrying a little bit of a torch for
her myself.

582
01:13:14,855 --> 01:13:18,656
- Oh, the bar-b-que boys are back.
- You keep your hands off of me.

583
01:13:24,457 --> 01:13:27,857
- Well they took her. Why'd they take just her?
- Maybe they start with the dessert first huh?

584
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:29,657
I wonder where they are going?

585
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,058
Oh they can't really be
headhunters.

586
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:37,258
Hey, what are those?

587
01:13:37,658 --> 01:13:41,659
Popscicles? They look like my draft
board.

588
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:48,260
On your knees woman. On your
knees to Boomada.

589
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,060
I kneel to no one.

590
01:13:57,061 --> 01:14:01,862
- That's scotch weave. Where did
you get it?
- Long ago, from a white man.

591
01:14:02,662 --> 01:14:04,262
He wore it like the skirt of a woman.

592
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:12,063
This man, was he called McTavish?
Yes, that is how he was called. Macatavish.

593
01:14:12,663 --> 01:14:14,663
Macatavish was my father.

594
01:14:20,864 --> 01:14:24,865
You are Princess Lala? Your father
was my good friend.

595
01:14:26,065 --> 01:14:31,866
till warm in my heart. You are his
daughter. Anything you wish for
shall be done.

596
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:37,066
21 gong salute.

597
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:48,668
Just listen to that, will you. For
whom the bells toll.

598
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:53,068
I saw that picture. Very few laughs.
Even Gary Cooper got killed.

599
01:14:54,669 --> 01:14:55,269
Yep.

600
01:14:57,069 --> 01:15:00,869
- Well, I don't mind getting killed.
But they're going to torture us.
- I couldn't stand torture. Me neither.

601
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,070
They're not going to torture me.
It hurts.

602
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:09,670
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Yeah, you ready?

603
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:28,473
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Yeah, you ready?

604
01:15:29,073 --> 01:15:34,874
Then Your Highness has no
problem. Here on Nuata, a woman
can have as many husbands as she can afford.

605
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:41,475
- I can marry them both?
- Why not? White women have
many husbands too.

606
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:46,275
But only one at a time. Here we do
not like the installment plan.

607
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:53,476
Marry them both. Oh that is
wonderful Boomada.

608
01:15:54,276 --> 01:15:58,877
Happiness is like smoke in the
wind. So quickly gone.

609
01:15:59,877 --> 01:16:01,277
Let it be done now, at once.

610
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:06,478
See to it that the two white men are
prepared for a Royal wedding to the
Princess.

611
01:16:07,078 --> 01:16:13,479
Royal wedding? Mazeltoph!
ROYAL WEDDING - M AZELTOPH!

612
01:16:17,879 --> 01:16:19,880
Now we will visit our chief.

613
01:16:41,882 --> 01:16:45,683
Wait a minute, you ain't cooking me
in no oil. You can eat me!

614
01:16:46,283 --> 01:16:48,883
I'm skinny, I'm stringy, I'm tough. I'll
give you indigestion.

615
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:53,284
- We will not eat you.
- Oh no, you are to be married.

616
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:57,485
Married?
- Now wait a minute, I'm not going
to marry you!

617
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:01,085
Eat me! Kill me! I'm fat, I'm puff,
I'm delicious.

618
01:17:01,485 --> 01:17:04,685
- No unpleasant aftertaste. Go ahead.
- You will not marry me.

619
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:06,886
You will marry the Princess of Batu.

620
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:12,086
You mean Lala? So, she finally
came to her senses.

621
01:17:13,687 --> 01:17:17,687
Lala. What is this, my trusseau?

622
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:22,088
Reminds me of a blind date I once
had in Cleveland.

623
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:29,289
That's perfect. You may proceed to
groom the groom.

624
01:17:30,289 --> 01:17:35,690
Oh poor George. This will kill him.
Oh well, some of us have it and
some of us don't.

625
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:39,890
But I feel like such a cad having so
much of it.

626
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,291
I've been able to undress myself,
since I was 17.

627
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:50,891
Well, I see my wedding headdress
is back from the dentist.

628
01:17:53,692 --> 01:17:57,492
Ah, ah, easy on the cologne. Let's
be subtle, shall we?

629
01:17:58,492 --> 01:18:03,093
I feel so delirious happy!

630
01:18:03,893 --> 01:18:07,894
Some of us have it, some of us
don't. Poor Harold.

631
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:13,094
He must have misplaced it.
- You may pour just a little cooking
sherry huh?

632
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,695
You are every bit as beautiful as I
have been told Princess Lala.

633
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:22,896
- Chief Rameanna has heard of me?
- Yes, my dear cousin.

634
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:27,096
- Kennerok!
- It is good to see you Lala and this too.

635
01:18:27,496 --> 01:18:31,897
- That's mine you thief.
- Not a thief my cousin, but a matchmaker.

636
01:18:32,497 --> 01:18:37,098
My dear wives are aging rapidly.
They bore me.

637
01:18:38,098 --> 01:18:42,098
You Princess will bring youth into
my home.

638
01:18:43,098 --> 01:18:46,899
- Youth! It's wonderful!
- No! NO!

639
01:18:47,299 --> 01:18:49,899
- This can not be.
- Silence!

640
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,500
Take the Princess into the bridal hut.

641
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:06,501
- She has spirit too.
- In the morning, in the light of
reason, she will agree to our bargin Rameanna.

642
01:19:07,301 --> 01:19:10,702
You can not do this. She has given
her heart to the two Americans.

643
01:19:11,302 --> 01:19:13,902
- Those white mice?
- I have an idea.

644
01:19:15,903 --> 01:19:19,703
Instead of their hearts, Lala shall
have their heads.

645
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:25,704
Shrunken, so. They make lovely bedpost

646
01:19:26,504 --> 01:19:31,705
But Rameanna. Listen to the
wedding dance. Already, the two
grooms are being prepared.

647
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:35,705
We can not stop this ceremony
without insulting the Gods and your people.

648
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:40,706
- Why not have your ceremony.
With two grooms and no bride!

649
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:47,107
Excellent! Two grooms and no bride.

650
01:19:47,907 --> 01:19:53,908
NO! Rachan, the God of the
sleeping volcano, will not permit the
sacrilege of a wedding without a bride.

651
01:19:54,508 --> 01:19:58,508
Who rules this island. Is it you or
the volcano?

652
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:05,709
You are right. I rule this island. I!
Not the volcano!

653
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:17,111
Raschan, God of the sleeping
volcano, do you approve of this action?

654
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:28,312
- You see?
- A silly superstition for old women.

655
01:20:29,112 --> 01:20:32,913
- You do not fool Rameanna with
your ventiloquism.

656
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:37,513
Now go. Attend the wedding of the
two grooms.

657
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:43,514
Without the bride.

658
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:50,515
- Say muscles, is the bride going to
wear one of these too? - Yes.

659
01:20:51,315 --> 01:20:55,116
Well, I'm game if she's game. We'll
win the door prize for sure.

660
01:20:56,316 --> 01:20:59,716
Hey wait a minute. Does the
Princess wear one of these too? - Yes.

661
01:21:00,316 --> 01:21:04,117
This could lead to a ticklish
situation. Ah, nice fit.

662
01:21:42,122 --> 01:21:45,122
Let the wedding ceremony begin.

663
01:22:13,726 --> 01:22:15,926
The wedding wine is ready.

664
01:22:22,327 --> 01:22:24,527
No bride.

665
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:35,529
On with the ceremony.

666
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:46,930
Continue.

667
01:22:57,331 --> 01:23:01,332
With this wine, I pronounce you
man and wife.

668
01:23:25,335 --> 01:23:29,336
Take them away. Advise me when
they awaken.

669
01:23:31,336 --> 01:23:33,136
I have plans for them.

670
01:23:50,538 --> 01:23:52,939
Lala...
Lala's mine.

671
01:24:16,142 --> 01:24:20,142
- Ah honey.
- Lala?

672
01:24:20,942 --> 01:24:23,943
- There's a man in bed with us.
- Yeah, I got a hold of him.

673
01:24:25,543 --> 01:24:26,943
- You!
- You!

674
01:24:27,543 --> 01:24:31,344
- Hey, hey, what's the idea?
Somebody switched roommates on me.
- Where's my wife? This woman is a man.

675
01:24:31,944 --> 01:24:35,544
- You do not have a wife.
- Are you kidding Jack? I'm prince
Harold of Attou.

676
01:24:36,144 --> 01:24:39,345
- You? I married Lala.
- You did not marry the Princess.

677
01:24:39,745 --> 01:24:42,145
- I married her.
- You did not marry her.

678
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:46,546
- I put on this bug-eyed beenie...
- I sweated my way into that pullover...

679
01:24:47,146 --> 01:24:50,546
- and I got feathers up my...
- What?

680
01:24:52,747 --> 01:24:56,547
- One of us has got to go to Reno.
- Let's hurry before one of us gets grabbed.

681
01:24:57,147 --> 01:25:00,147
- Where's Lala?
- Princess Lala is to become the
seventh wife of our chief.

682
01:25:00,548 --> 01:25:02,348
What becomes of us?

683
01:25:02,948 --> 01:25:05,948
You have five minutes to live.

684
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:09,749
- Will we feel it?
- No we use sodium penterium.

685
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:11,949
- Oh that's sweet.
- Isn't that thoughtful?

686
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,150
I guess this is it.

687
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,351
At least we're going out together.

688
01:25:25,951 --> 01:25:29,151
- We've been through a lot together
old pal.

689
01:25:30,351 --> 01:25:33,352
I can't complain though. We've had
a lot of laughs.

690
01:25:34,752 --> 01:25:40,353
I just hope in your heart of hearts
you can forgive me for the few little
bitty times I tried to con you.

691
01:25:42,753 --> 01:25:44,753
There's a storm coming up her huh?

692
01:25:46,554 --> 01:25:50,554
I forgive you George. I know you've
always meant well.

693
01:25:52,754 --> 01:25:54,755
I must have been a trial to you.

694
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:02,956
Say, we might get postponed here
on account of rain.

695
01:26:04,556 --> 01:26:09,156
Well Harold, you know of course,
I don't have to tell you what you've
meant to me.

696
01:26:09,557 --> 01:26:11,957
We've been through so much
together...

697
01:26:12,757 --> 01:26:16,557
.. and here we are in life, in death
we face it together.

698
01:26:49,762 --> 01:26:51,562
We got to get Lala.

699
01:27:05,364 --> 01:27:07,764
Lala...
Lala...

700
01:27:09,164 --> 01:27:10,965
Help! Help!

701
01:27:14,565 --> 01:27:15,765
Heeeeeelp!

702
01:27:16,765 --> 01:27:19,166
- I'll get her, I'll get her.
- What do you mean? I'll get her.

703
01:27:21,366 --> 01:27:23,166
Help. Help.

704
01:27:34,368 --> 01:27:36,368
All this meat and no tomato.

705
01:27:46,969 --> 01:27:50,170
- Are you all right honey?
- Yes dear!

706
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,770
Come on, let's get away from this
weenie roast. We've got the jewels.

707
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,571
Yeah, I don't want to be a rich
cinder.

708
01:28:14,173 --> 01:28:16,373
Say, look at all that rice growing
down there.

709
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:21,374
Yeah rice. It's symbolic.

710
01:28:21,974 --> 01:28:26,974
Symbolic?
- Yeah, in puddings and weddings eh Princess?

711
01:28:27,975 --> 01:28:30,375
Look, a ship.

712
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:34,575
- We're saved.
- We must get to the beach.

713
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:40,776
- ey, the ship's captain can perform the ceremony.
- I'll take care of my own wedding
arrangements, if you don't mind.

714
01:28:47,177 --> 01:28:52,178
- If you're a real nice boy, I'll let you
give the bachelor's dinner.
- You're a little heavy, but you can be flower girl.

715
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:55,778
- This girl is marrying me buster.
- This kid needs me.

716
01:28:56,378 --> 01:29:00,179
- Now wait just a minute here. All right!
- Let's settle this once and for all
before we get on the ship.

717
01:29:00,579 --> 01:29:04,579
- Let's toss a coin. Coin?
- We're tabed. I got a better idea.
We'll indian wrestle.

718
01:29:06,380 --> 01:29:10,380
Oh no. Last time I won, you gave
me an indian. Here, let Lala decide.

719
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,780
- We'll draw straws.
- Yeah!

720
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:17,781
If she draws a long straw, she gets
me, a short one, you.

721
01:29:18,381 --> 01:29:20,381
- I'll hold the straws.
- Please, please.

722
01:29:20,982 --> 01:29:22,582
I've already made up my mind.

723
01:29:23,782 --> 01:29:26,582
- Tough luck old man.
- Tough luck old man.

724
01:29:27,782 --> 01:29:31,783
- I'm sorry Harold.
- You pick him?

725
01:29:32,383 --> 01:29:35,383
- Yes.
- Oh how near-sighted can you be?

726
01:29:36,183 --> 01:29:38,984
Cheer up Buster. You'll fi nd
someone. Try the lonely hearts club huh?

727
01:29:39,784 --> 01:29:41,584
Lala is the only girl in the world for me.

728
01:29:42,184 --> 01:29:45,585
Say, you've got your basket there.
Now if you just had your magic
flute, you'd be in business.

729
01:29:46,785 --> 01:29:52,386
- Well... just so happens...
- That's my galant little man, he's
always thinking.

730
01:30:15,989 --> 01:30:19,789
- Jane Russel... oh wing ding!

731
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,990
Ladies...

732
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:31,391
Hey, wait a minute. What are you
going to do with two girls?

733
01:30:32,591 --> 01:30:35,391
That's my problem...

734
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:40,192
Hey, come back. Wait for me.

735
01:30:40,992 --> 01:30:44,592
Oh no you don't. Stay right where
you are folks. This picutre isn't over yet.

736
01:30:45,192 --> 01:30:48,393
Hey wait...
- Oh no you don't, no you don't!

737
01:30:48,993 --> 01:30:51,393
Stay sitting. Hey
George... oooooh.

738
01:30:51,993 --> 01:30:54,394
No, stay right there! George!

739
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:58,194
Get the writers, get the producers,
get my agent. Get a girl.

740
01:30:58,994 --> 01:31:00,595
This is sabotage.
