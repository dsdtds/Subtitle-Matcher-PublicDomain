00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
www.caseway.ai is for people 
who can’t afford a lawyer

2
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,274
You got to hammer faster.
Get going.

3
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:05,661
Yeah, hurry up there.
I'm getting hungry.

4
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,781
Come on Roy!

5
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:09,702
Hey somebody is shooting.

6
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:11,119
No.

7
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,639
Why they are too, I heard 'em.

8
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:16,097
Sounds like it's over at the dam.

9
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:17,317
Let's get going.

10
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:39,931
What's that?

11
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:44,264
Yes follow my orders.
Use all the forces necessary.

12
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,142
I'll have the sheriff over
from his ranch right away.

13
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,181
Hello operator, give me 21, Pottingham.

14
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,056
- Hello.
- Hello, sheriff.

15
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,046
There's another fight at the dam.

16
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,431
Those rangers have broken loose again.

17
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,399
Well, why don't you give 'em
some water then?

18
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:06,801
That's our business.

19
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:07,926
Are you going to do your duty,

20
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:10,046
or do we have to kill some of those fools?

21
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:12,272
All right I'll get out there
as soon as I can.

22
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,031
I bet that's Lamb and Hank,

23
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:31,469
they wasn't fooling when they said

24
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,729
they's gonna raid the dam.

25
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:33,839
I guess you're right.

26
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:37,312
Hey, there's a couple more
of them company guards.

27
00:03:37,472 --> 00:03:38,639
Yeah, well I'll stop them.

28
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,801
You might as well surrender.

29
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:42,181
Hold it!

30
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,597
- All right, keep 'em up.
- Hey yo!

31
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,181
Come on, let's get to that bell.

32
00:05:00,222 --> 00:05:01,431
Hey, wait a minute!

33
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,897
There's some horsemen coming down there.

34
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:07,944
It's probably the sheriff.

35
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:09,244
You got to go home and
take care of that arm,

36
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:10,306
I'll get the water to you.

37
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:11,847
Alright, Roy.

38
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,439
Well we got to work fast.

39
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,172
Blow the lock and open that valve.

40
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:39,042
You boys, turn them guards loose.

41
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,556
Wait a minute Sheriff! Hold it.

42
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:46,036
Don't you point that gun at me, Roy.

43
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:48,056
I don't know how else to
keep your waiting sheriff.

44
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,744
The old timers getting this
water need it mighty bad.

45
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,127
I'm gonna have to take you in.

46
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,047
Take it easy, we'll go
along to jail peaceably

47
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,617
as soon as we get enough water,
but not until we do.

48
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,420
I said take it easy.

49
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,567
That's a fine way for you to act.

50
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,011
Roy Rogers, son of a congressman,
fighting the water company.

51
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,327
If my dad had lived there wouldn't

52
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:07,467
have been any water company.

53
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:08,977
Just the same, the law is the law,

54
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,097
and property's property.

55
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,359
And there goes ours.
100 feet a second.

56
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:13,764
Make them turn off that water.

57
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:38,556
Hey! I dropped the valve wheel!

58
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:43,211
You fellas got any other way
of shutting that water off?

59
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:46,281
There ain't another valve wheel
like that in the whole county.

60
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:51,609
All right, Roy. There ain't no use
in you holding us here any longer.

61
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,089
Don't be downhearted, Sheriff.

62
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,372
You won't be so chipper when
you get behind bars, Roy.

63
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,431
Behind jail bars, huh? Well
Sheriff, that reminds me.

64
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>Send my mail to the county jail</i>

65
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,472
<i>Send my mail to</i>

66
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,931
<i>the county jail.</i>

67
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:18,456
<i>Tell our saddle-pals tonight,</i>

68
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,276
<i>if they've got some news to write...</i>

69
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,934
<i>Send my mail to the county jail.</i>

70
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,339
<i>Say goodbye to your favorite gal.</i>

71
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:32,097
<i>Say goodbye to your special gal.</i>

72
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,847
<i>We're supposed to have a date</i>

73
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:36,481
<i>but we reckon we'll be late.</i>

74
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:37,821
<i>Say goodbye to your favorite gal.</i>

75
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:45,297
<i>Tonight when coyotes howl,</i>

76
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:50,972
<i>and mountain lions prowl.</i>

77
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:53,959
<i>I'll be watching the moon</i>

78
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,329
<i>and countin' the stars.</i>

79
00:07:56,651 --> 00:08:00,181
<i>Can't you see me looking
through the jail house bars?</i>

80
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:04,431
<i>Pass the hat and collect our bails,</i>

81
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:12,693
<i>if they ask you where I am,
say I'm in an awful jam.</i>

82
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,139
<i>Send that bail to the county jail.</i>

83
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,472
Ho, ho, whoo!

84
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,306
Whoa, Nelly, whoa!

85
00:08:55,097 --> 00:08:56,097
Stop ringing that bell.

86
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:57,556
What do you want on here?

87
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,431
I said stop ringing that bell.

88
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:00,764
Huh?

89
00:09:23,306 --> 00:09:24,702
I thought you said you was
coming along peaceably?

90
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:25,931
Well I did, but Nelly didn't.

91
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:27,836
Once a fire horse, always a fire

92
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,056
horse, Doug.

93
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:31,354
You mean every time that
knot-head hears a bell

94
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,562
- she's going to act like that?
- That's right.

95
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,306
She ain't with me. I'll give her
a

96
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,591
good sellin' 'fore anybody finds
out about them tricks.

97
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,437
Stop this noise! You're
disturbing the meeting.

98
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,306
Well, Roy, my boy I'm glad to see you.

99
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:47,306
- How are you mayor?
- Fine.

100
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:50,956
I see you brought all your boys
in town for the meeting. Come

101
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:52,014
right in boys.

102
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,097
They can't. They're under
arrest.

103
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,639
What's the charge? I

104
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,789
don't want Roy to miss the meeting.

105
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,931
He's charged with

106
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:01,427
trespassing on the water
company's property, fighting

107
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:02,536
with the guards and stealing their water.

108
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:03,806
Hooray for Roy!

109
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:06,306
Silence!

110
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:11,181
If that's the case, I'll hold court
right here and now. I'm sorry boys,

111
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,806
but I'll have to punish you.

112
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:17,382
I fine you for disturbing the

113
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,431
peace. $1 in court cost.

114
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,036
No, no, you can pay the clerk
later. Come

115
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,139
on, you're late already.

116
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:29,806
Before we criticize the
congressman who has represented

117
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:35,056
us so bravely for two terms in
Washington,

118
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:39,431
let us remember... Let us
remember!

119
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,431
Just a moment. Just a moment!

120
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:46,431
Wait a minute. Pardon me, but
there happens to be a meeting

121
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:47,972
going on here.

122
00:10:48,056 --> 00:10:49,056
I'm sorry, Richard.

123
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:50,764
As the son of a former

124
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,801
congressman, you should have
more respect for a public

125
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,702
meeting. It seems to me that you
should get here in time in order

126
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,722
to be posted.

127
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,931
Well, I'm already posted.

128
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,097
Oh, you are, are you?

129
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,409
Sure, Mayor Biggs started out by
talking about high water rates.

130
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,749
Then he showed a picture of
Congressman Scully and denounced

131
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:10,056
him plenty. And Mayor Jenkins of
Hilton City, founded in 1848,

132
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,702
said the water was free then,
that it ought to be free now. And

133
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,842
it was time the federal
government did something about

134
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:20,889
it by gosh. And you as manager
of the water company said I'd like

135
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,851
to lower the water rates, but
we're losing money.

136
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:27,972
Marvelous Roy, marvelous.
Practically word for word. But

137
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:30,447
- how did you know?
- That's easy. You've

138
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:33,166
all been saying the same thing
since my dad was Congressman.

139
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,222
Wait a minute. I still have the
floor. As I was saying before I

140
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:43,556
was so rudely interrupted. Let
me remind you that Congressman

141
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:47,431
Scully is the only man among us
fitted to go to Washington and

142
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:51,181
- represent...
- The Great Western Water and Power Company.

143
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:52,764
The Great Western...

144
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,597
I mean...

145
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:00,756
I still say that the best man
fitted to represent you in

146
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,681
Washington is the man whose face
you see on that poster!

147
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,806
The people's friend?

148
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:17,972
Folks, I

149
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,254
just held court for a man who
really deserves that title.

150
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:24,997
He was brought before me for
fighting the water company. Now,

151
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:29,431
are we going to send him to
jail? Shall we send him to

152
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,744
Washington like we did his father?

153
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:32,764
Yes!

154
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,431
Take a wire. Mr. John B.
Fairbanks, president the Great

155
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,431
Western Water and Power Company,
Washington, DC.

156
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,014
Look at that, Admiral.

157
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:50,972
- Rogers for Congressman. He hasn't a chance.
- What do you know

158
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,621
about Western politics? You're a
Washington attorney. Why with

159
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:57,702
beating up our men and stealing
our water, that boy is a hero to

160
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:58,722
those people out there.

161
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,202
They'll forget all about it
before election

162
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:01,764
day. See no cause for alarm.

163
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:04,764
You don't, eh? Then you need
glasses. We're

164
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,089
leaving for Saintsville tonight
with Congressman Scully.

165
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,161
But dad, we can't leave tonight.
Oh, we're just mailing out the

166
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:13,077
- invitation to our reception.
- Postpone

167
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:14,222
it. Postpone it!?

168
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:24,647
- Helo, Richard.
- How do you do, Mr. Pembley?

169
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,889
You know my daughter. Mr.
Andrews and Congressman Scully

170
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:29,431
- of course.
- Richard.

171
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,689
Welcome home, congressman. Your
campaign is on

172
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:32,931
full blast.

173
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:34,977
Campaign my butt. Posters never
elected anybody.

174
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:19,157
- A lot of votes he'll get that way.
- You bet your life he will.

175
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,704
Don't forget there's plenty of
Women Voters. What do you think

176
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,086
Eleanor? Would you vote for him?

177
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:26,722
He has a nice voice.

178
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:30,202
- And that's all he's got.
- He can't campaign without advertising. He

179
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,222
has no money for that.

180
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,431
I know this western country and
I promise to the throne... I'll

181
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:55,347
prove when he's elected that my
steers are never wrong.

182
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:39,652
- You don't need money for advertising if you have brains.
- Brains?

183
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:40,889
Yes, brains.

184
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:45,452
Get ahold of Rogers, tell him I want
to see him at my hotel. Important and

185
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,712
- personal business.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,492
- Now Roy, you're doing fine.
- Thanks.

187
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,422
I'm out of a campaign manager.

188
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:58,167
Well, everything's under control.

189
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:01,931
- Hi.
- Hello Rogers, can I speak to you privately for a

190
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:03,306
minute?

191
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,202
Anything you have to say to me
is all right for my friends to

192
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:06,222
hear.

193
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:08,889
- Hello, boys.
- Hi.- Hello, friend. -Hi-

194
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:20,264
Very funny, boys. Very funny.
Mr. Fairbanks would like

195
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,952
to see you over at his hotel. He
said it was very important and

196
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,014
personal.

197
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:27,314
Sure. Why not? Tell him I'll be
over tomorrow.

198
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:28,764
Okay.

199
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:36,077
I bet that guy, Fairbanks is
scared. He's gonna talk turkey,

200
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,097
you'll see.

201
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,181
Maybe.

202
00:17:42,014 --> 00:17:43,869
Anyway, it'll give me a chance
to tell him what I think

203
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:47,847
of him. And that'll be plenty.
50% cut on water rate. Don't

204
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,416
make me laugh. Mr. Fairbanks.
Let me tell you something, you

205
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:56,306
cuckoo. You run this country into
the ground long enough. 60%. Now

206
00:17:57,514 --> 00:18:00,034
I didn't come here to haggle Mr.
Fairbanks. It's 75% or nothing.

207
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,795
So, I'm driving a hard bargain
am I? Well, that's too bad.

208
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:08,452
Here's my last word. If you
don't knuckle down, we'll run

209
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,661
you and your cutthroat crowd
right out of business.

210
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,806
Bravo! Bravissimo!

211
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,941
Keep going partner, you got him
on the ropes.

212
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:18,462
Hello. I don't generally talk
myself like this. I was just

213
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,972
sort of rehearsing.

214
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:24,806
And doing very well, too. But
how about putting a little more

215
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,994
emphasis on your exit line?
Because I presume that is your

216
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:29,014
exit line?

217
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:32,041
Probably. Old man Fairbanks is
apt to kick me out when I get

218
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,347
that far.

219
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:36,327
I gather you're not exactly an
admirer of John Fairbanks. He's

220
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:37,347
plenty tough.

221
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:39,814
Probably the kind of a man who
beats his wife.

222
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:45,431
He does. I heard he schlags his
daughter on occasion, then she

223
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:47,384
probably deserves it though.

224
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:50,921
No doubt she does. If I'm
elected, I'll get federal water

225
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:54,446
for this state if I have to hog tie
every politician in Washington.

226
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:56,847
- Good for you. I hope you're elected.
- Thanks.

227
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,342
Well, I guess I'll be going.

228
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,869
I'm going that way too, we could
ride along together.

229
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:02,889
Swell.

230
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,739
What is your daughter doing with Rogers?

231
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,264
How do I know?

232
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:27,764
Well, I don't like it.

233
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,446
Tell that to Eleanor and see
what happens.

234
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:38,222
Gentlemen, may I present Mr.
Rogers. This is Tom Andrews. Mr.

235
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,431
Richard, your worthy opponent,
Congressman Scully. Oh, and my

236
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,431
father, Mr. Fairbanks.

237
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,097
- Your father?
- Yes.

238
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:51,957
Oh, by the way, dad, Mr. Rogers
considers you a skinflint, a

239
00:19:52,764 --> 00:19:54,431
penny pinching pirate, and what was that?

240
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:58,466
Sounds to me like you just about
covered the territory.

241
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,661
Beat it rat. We want to talk
business.

242
00:20:03,597 --> 00:20:06,389
Well, that reminds me Fairbanks.
Is it true you beat your

243
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:06,847
daughter?

244
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,264
No.

245
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:10,681
But it's a darn good idea.

246
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:17,639
Well, sit down. You seem to have
a lot of

247
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,126
common sense, Rogers. I think
you're the man I need to look

248
00:20:21,472 --> 00:20:22,912
after some of my business interests.

249
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:23,972
That would mean giving

250
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,459
- up my campaign for Congress, wouldn't it?
- Well, yes, it

251
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:29,541
would. But your salary would be
three times as much as you'd

252
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:30,597
make as a congressman.

253
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:33,142
Thanks, but I have a family
weakness for going to

254
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,581
Washington. I'd like to see some
of the places my dad told me

255
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:36,722
about.

256
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:40,639
- Would four times as much money interest you?
- No, nor 10

257
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:43,952
- times as much.
- You might regret passing up a mighty good

258
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:44,972
proposition young man.

259
00:20:46,264 --> 00:20:48,864
Now I'll make you one. Either
your company cuts water rates to the

260
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,244
bone or I'll get federal control
of water in the state when I go to

261
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,264
Washington.

262
00:20:52,597 --> 00:20:54,837
When you go to Washington? Well,
you're not there yet Mr.

263
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,056
Rogers.

264
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:08,781
Imagine a congressman dressed like that.

265
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:13,764
Take off those

266
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,577
- clothes.
- Well, what's the matter with them?

267
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:17,931
This for one thing...-Say-
...and this!

268
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:19,431
- What?
- Even those

269
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,121
pretty spats. The voters want a
man who represents them, not a

270
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:26,744
city dude. You're going to be a
man of the people. You're going

271
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:28,577
to wear western clothes and ride a horse.

272
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:29,931
- A horse? -Yes!
- I can't ride!

273
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:31,681
- You will ride!
- What?!

274
00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:54,014
Whoa, Nelly!

275
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,311
Just now pray, the people are
giving Congressman

276
00:22:02,597 --> 00:22:05,472
Scully a grand ovation. Just
listen to all those cheers. You

277
00:22:06,806 --> 00:22:09,446
know, two days ago, I thought that
Rogers was their choice. But now

278
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:14,181
it looks like a landslide for
Scully. And now ladies and

279
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:17,327
gentlemen, you will hear from
your candidate for reelection,

280
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:18,556
William P Scully.

281
00:22:26,806 --> 00:22:27,806
Friends,

282
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:32,556
my friends, it's great to get
into these clothes again. I can

283
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,639
feel a horse beneath me once more.

284
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:23,764
Ladies and gentlemen,

285
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:25,869
here's a round by round
description that Scully's

286
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:28,089
saddled horse has just run away
with him and Congressman

287
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:30,142
Roy Rogers has rescued him from
the horse trough.

288
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,422
What a mess we're in now with
Rogers elected. Let a hick

289
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,872
- rancher out-smart us.
- You insisted that I ride a horse. I

290
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:10,442
- told you I...
- Shut up and get out of here.- Well if that's the way

291
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:12,879
- you feel about it.
- Get out before I lose my temper! -

292
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,014
No you don't.

293
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:20,389
Whipped by a smart-aleck yoke.

294
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:23,574
How does it feel to take a licking dad?

295
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,431
Licking? This is only round one.

296
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:28,014
We're leaving for Washington
too. Buck

297
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:29,639
him there at every turn.

298
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:44,989
- Here's a letter for you, Roy.
- Thanks.

299
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:58,869
You know any cow-hands that uses

300
00:24:58,889 --> 00:24:59,889
perfume?

301
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:06,404
Thanks for the send-off, folks.
And don't worry, I'm gonna see that

302
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,577
that water bill goes through
pronto. I figure I'll be back in

303
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:09,597
about a week.

304
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,264
Now me, being Congressman Roy
Rogers' here personal execute,

305
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:19,739
even Secretary, I promise that if Roy...

306
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,431
Hey! Wait for me... wait for me!

307
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,806
Congressman Marlowe's office
please. Good morning, Congressman

308
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:49,431
Rogers calling Congressman Marlowe
again. Oh, when do you expect him?

309
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:55,431
Yes, please have him call me
back... I don't know what Marlowe has

310
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,419
an office for, he's never in it.

311
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,589
Well, he's got to have some
place where you can find out

312
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:05,264
- that he ain't in. -Anything important?
- Oh, no, just the usual 4011

313
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:08,872
constitutions wanting to know
where that federal water is you

314
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:12,181
- promised them.
- So do I.- Ain't there nobody else you can see about

315
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:13,722
that water bill?

316
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:16,714
No, sir. Marlowe is the money
man and he has to be seen.

317
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:20,431
Huh? Who's that from, Marlowe?

318
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:25,431
No, it's not even signed. Let's
say, listen to this. If you want to

319
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:28,744
meet Congressman Marlowe, join
the foxhunt near his country

320
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:29,764
estate next Saturday.

321
00:26:59,056 --> 00:27:01,376
Hey, sounds like a jailbreak.
We've got to get out of here.

322
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:02,551
Them bloodhounds is vicious.

323
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:04,759
The hunt's started. Come on.

324
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:38,077
All them hound dogs against
one poor little fox. Ain't no justice.

325
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:39,097
Tally ho!

326
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,779
Hey, that horse is running away with her!

327
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:47,889
Tally ho!

328
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:53,139
Tally ho!

329
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:17,889
Are you alright?

330
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:20,067
What in the world do you think
you're doing?

331
00:28:21,431 --> 00:28:22,951
I thought your horse was running away.

332
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,239
No, but the fox is. I'd have won
his brush in another 100 yards if

333
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:27,717
you hadn't played Lochinvar.

334
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:28,931
I'm awful sorry.

335
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:32,764
Doesn't matter.

336
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,681
So tell me,

337
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:40,837
how's this stinking Congressman
making out in Washington?

338
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,667
Not so good. The only luck that
I had so far is meeting you

339
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,617
again. I've tried to follow your
advice about seeing Congressman

340
00:28:47,847 --> 00:28:51,556
- Marlowe, but he dodges me like a wild mustang.
- My advice? - Nobody

341
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,367
else I know uses perfumed
writing paper. It's mighty nice of you

342
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:58,654
to show me the ropes, even if
Marlowe is too busy crashing society.

343
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:01,722
Not crashing society.
Congressman Marlowe gave this fox

344
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:04,411
hunt because he wanted a
political favor from one of his

345
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:05,431
guests.

346
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:07,744
Like a medicine man putting on a
show to get his customers in

347
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:08,764
line to buy.

348
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,056
Yes, that's it.

349
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:13,216
You see, here in Washington
that's the trick to get the

350
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:14,472
ear of the right person.

351
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:17,404
Well I couldn't very well give a foxhunt.

352
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,889
No, no, but you can give a party.

353
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,014
Well, who'd come?

354
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:25,222
Oh... look!

355
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:31,681
Get these loud dogs outta here!

356
00:29:32,264 --> 00:29:33,264
Go away!

357
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:35,014
Hey, what's happening?

358
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:39,514
Go on away! Get out of here.

359
00:29:43,764 --> 00:29:45,484
Shew! Get on away from here. Get
outta here!

360
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:47,459
Get these hound dogs out of here.

361
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:52,431
Dad, you remember Mr. Rogers,
don't you?

362
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,431
What? Oh yeah, sure. How do you
do?

363
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:58,929
Oh, Congressman Marlowe, this is
Congressman Rogers.

364
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,204
- I'm glad to know you, Mr. Rogers.
- How you do, Congressman?

365
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,369
I'd like a few words with you. I
want to ask you to...

366
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:06,389
Oh, um, to be

367
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,389
his guest next Tuesday evening
at the Fairview Country

368
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:13,431
Club. All of you... Mr. Rogers
is giving a surprise party.

369
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:17,431
Doesn't that sound exciting? Oh,
well, you'll be there won't you

370
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:18,972
Senator Wilson?

371
00:30:19,514 --> 00:30:22,181
- Certainly Ms. Fairbanks.
- And no party would be complete

372
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,737
without you and Mrs. Marlowe,
Congressman.

373
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:28,881
A surprise party, of course
we'll come, won't we Edward?

374
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:30,459
Why, I think it's perfectly sweet

375
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:33,431
of Mr. Rogers to invite us all.
Don't you dear?

376
00:30:34,472 --> 00:30:36,432
I don't know anything about
these eastern parties.

377
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:38,014
Well, make it Western.

378
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,689
Swell, I'll send a wire to Larry
and the boys.

379
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:45,472
All join

380
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:48,532
hands, circle down south. Another
little moonshine in your mouth.

381
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,344
You're home and grant field back to
the lady in the lead. The man to your left

382
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,529
and right. Your partner right and
left in a hurry up boys. Don't be

383
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:58,121
slow, the chicken in the bedpan
picking up dough. To meet your

384
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:01,108
partner, all's floor. Meet your honey
and pat her on the head. And she

385
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:03,837
don't like biscuit, feed her
cornbread and chew on tobacco

386
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,331
and squirt it on the wall. And
swing that gal, lean and tall.

387
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:09,426
Rogers certainly has a peculiar
idea of entertainment.

388
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:10,972
Yes, isn't it quaint?

389
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:13,609
I don't know when I've had such
a good time.

390
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,806
So far, folks, all you've seen
of ranch life has been a lot of

391
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:30,056
fun. But there's another side I
want you to see. And that's a

392
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,639
surprise I promised.

393
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:37,154
These first scenes are the way
our ranches

394
00:31:38,014 --> 00:31:40,374
used to look. Every range had
dress like that in the summer.

395
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,917
When winter covered it was snow.
We had plenty of that good

396
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:47,764
alfalfa for feed. We flattened
our beef on that green. Every

397
00:31:48,931 --> 00:31:51,556
valley and every canyon had a
stream of running water. Then

398
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:55,681
nature took a handle. Every year
we had less and less rain. This is

399
00:31:56,972 --> 00:32:00,972
what happened: dry spells, drought
and dust storms. After the dust

400
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:05,306
storm, this is what is left.
That's Glen Saunders' house, he

401
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:09,847
lost his two children from dust
pneumonia. That's Luke Chalmers

402
00:32:11,097 --> 00:32:13,617
place. He just gave up, moved
away and never even stopped to dig

403
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:18,972
up his equipment... Those cattle
are Dave Peters'; he lost 150 head

404
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:20,961
which meant every cent he owned.

405
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:22,949
All of this tragedy and ruin ladies and

406
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:27,306
gentlemen, because of lack of
water. In times like these, folks

407
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:29,431
just naturally turn to prayer.

408
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,514
Dust... dust...

409
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:42,222
Dust in the skies. Dust on the trail. Dust
in my eyes. Dust. Can't see the sun can't

410
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:54,764
find my way. The dust has won. The cattle
and the sheep put down to sleep, better

411
00:32:56,347 --> 00:33:03,931
realize their pain. The vultures in
the sky know the time is nigh, will

412
00:33:04,597 --> 00:33:08,431
- it fly away? Away?
- Oh no...

413
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:39,889
We were the home

414
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:46,806
where the buffalo roam, where
the deer and the antelope play.

415
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:49,431
Here was a place where

416
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:58,347
the cattle would graze. The corn
and alfalfa once waved. Where are

417
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:03,431
the ranches, the cow hunting
crowd? What has become of the

418
00:34:04,972 --> 00:34:12,972
range? Out of the blue came a
threatening load causing this awful change.

419
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:35,181
Oh lord we're in your range and
sunshine. Dust. Dust.

420
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:45,639
Must it be? Can it be? Can it
be?

421
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:52,014
Oh lord have mercy on poor me.

422
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:03,781
- We've got to get busy on that bill, Marlowe.
- I agree with you.

423
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,431
Rather unethical, but very
effective. I'm going west in

424
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,597
about 10 days and I'll get you
relief if I find those

425
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:19,356
conditions existing. Do you have
my support on

426
00:35:19,847 --> 00:35:21,472
that water bill too, Rogers?

427
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:24,431
Dad, it looks as though you've
lost round two.

428
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:28,556
- You needn't rub it in. Think it's funny do you?
- Fairbanks,

429
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:32,666
I had no idea that conditions in
your state were so serious.

430
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:35,872
They aren't. I'll take you out
there and show you that Rogers

431
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:38,574
- misrepresented things.
- I hope you're right for your own good.

432
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,987
After all, it's your water company that's

433
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,597
on the spot, you know...

434
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:48,556
Young woman, you helped stage
this entertainment. You realize it

435
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:50,544
might ruin my water company? Oh,

436
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,431
one of your water companies.

437
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,806
- Are you in love with this cowboy?
- Oh,

438
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:00,347
I don't know.

439
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:05,286
Well, you tell him from me that
he's in for the dog-gone-dest

440
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:06,786
- licking he ever had.
- Oh, yes, I'll

441
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:09,264
tell him, but he won't believe me.

442
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,406
Say, that was swell. And the way
you was calling them ranchers out

443
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:20,494
by their names you even had me
fooled. You'd think they's neighbors

444
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:21,014
of ours.

445
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:22,764
Oh, weren't they?

446
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:29,556
No, those pictures were taken in
another state, Eleanor. I

447
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,396
couldn't get a newsreel of our
own dust storms.

448
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:35,972
Tell me my friend, is your
middle name Barnum by any tune?

449
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:38,421
Oh no. His middle name's James.

450
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:43,431
Oh, I see after Jesse. Oh no.

451
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:46,137
Leaving soon Mr. Fairbanks

452
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:49,431
Yes. I'll wipe that grin off
your face yet.

453
00:36:53,222 --> 00:36:54,262
Nevermind, you were grand.

454
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:57,997
With your help. When will I see
you? I'm leaving for the West

455
00:36:58,389 --> 00:36:59,389
pretty soon.

456
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:04,764
Now what a coincidence. So are
we... Oh yes daddy, I'm coming...

457
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:20,972
And so I take great pleasure in
introducing to you the most

458
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,389
important man who ever hit old Sage
County. And the only man who can

459
00:37:26,472 --> 00:37:28,592
give us federal control of
water. Congressman Marlowe.

460
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,764
Citizens, as chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, I am

461
00:37:47,972 --> 00:37:50,431
authorized to announce that we
are here to make a study of the

462
00:37:51,556 --> 00:37:55,431
drought conditions in this
section... Better cover up fast

463
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,679
Congressman, before the
newspapers get wind of this.

464
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:03,781
However, we have already learned
that conditions are not as bad as

465
00:38:04,806 --> 00:38:07,764
we were led to believe. And we
find that existing utilities are

466
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,431
quite adequate for the present.
Now that is, all thank you for

467
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,097
your kind welcome.

468
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,464
I said your methods were
unethical but I underrated you.

469
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:33,756
You're nothing but a cheap
trickster. I admit the film I

470
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:36,662
showed you wasn't taken in this
state. But conditions here are

471
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,364
just as bad, if not worse. As far
as I'm concerned young man, that

472
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:40,721
bill never will be passed.

473
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:42,749
I'll back you up on that, Marlowe.

474
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:46,077
I had a right to trick you when
the lives of these folks depend

475
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:48,537
on water. If you don't think
this country is dry, just look it

476
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:51,081
- over and see for yourself.
- Sorry, but I'm not interested.

477
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:54,489
I came all this way to see the
conditions of the dust storm. Don't

478
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:56,002
be silly dear, there aren't any.

479
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,066
I told you I'd wipe that smile
off your face.

480
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:07,742
You've had very capable help. I
should have known better than to

481
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:09,009
trust a woman with a secret.

482
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:21,014
Edward, I'm so hot and dusty.
Perhaps we'd better not go any

483
00:39:21,556 --> 00:39:22,556
farther after all.

484
00:39:23,389 --> 00:39:25,847
Sorry dear, but it's too late
now. You wanted to go, so I

485
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,687
promised Mr. Fairbanks I'd meet
him at the dam.

486
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:29,889
But Edward...

487
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,724
- Get out, all of you. Set the drivers, we're taking the cars.
- This is an

488
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:41,827
outrage, I'm Congressman Marlowe.
You can't leave us out here on foot!

489
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:42,847
You can use our horses.

490
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:01,119
Well, there's only one thing to
do. Take the horses and ride back to

491
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:02,139
Sageville.

492
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:15,306
My mercy, what a dry country. I
don't see how people live here.

493
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:20,484
It wasn't always like this. Wouldn't
be now if the farmers had water.

494
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:27,431
Evidently you still believe in
motion pictures. Listen. Listen,

495
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:31,389
there must be a camp ahead. And
that means a drink of water.

496
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:37,431
The old Chuck Wagon's rhythm
starts about noon. Then you'll

497
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,347
hear those cow hen sipping soup
very soon. And there's music,

498
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:46,556
music to the rhythm, music to
the rhythm of the range.

499
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:08,079
- Nice of you to drop in.
- Hello, Congressman.- Don't tell me

500
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:10,786
you're making an official tour
of the drought section after all.

501
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:13,006
We're making a tour, all right,
but not an official one.

502
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,037
We were held up by bandits and
they took our cars away from us

503
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:18,189
and made us ride these horrible,
bumpy horses.

504
00:41:19,097 --> 00:41:21,202
We'll tell you about that later.
Right now we are too thirsty to

505
00:41:21,222 --> 00:41:22,431
- talk.
- That's too bad.

506
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:24,097
Yeah, ain't that tough.

507
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,369
We only got about a pint of
water left. We done

508
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,389
give it to the horses.

509
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:30,939
You see, we didn't expect to have
any visitors. You mean you can't even

510
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:34,246
give us a drink. Well, we might
find enough for the ladies but

511
00:41:34,556 --> 00:41:37,036
the men will have to wait till
we reach Larkins place tomorrow.

512
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:40,431
Get the canteen Frog. You folks
just make yourself at home. Boys

513
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:43,352
go saddle the horses and fix
them a bite to eat.

514
00:42:13,056 --> 00:42:14,056
That's all there is.

515
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,829
Much farther to this lock and ranch?

516
00:43:47,597 --> 00:43:49,577
- Not so much, just the other side of the river.
- River.

517
00:43:49,597 --> 00:43:50,597
Did you say River?

518
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:53,786
- Where?
- Right there. Used to run bank full when everybody got the

519
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:54,806
water from it.

520
00:43:55,722 --> 00:43:58,162
- But what happened?
- Your company built the dam and dried it

521
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:01,694
- up.
- Dried it up? Well everything seems dried up in this country.

522
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,336
That's what I tried to tell you.

523
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,764
Looks like a water wagon. Hey
stop!

524
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:16,806
Can we have some water?

525
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:18,347
I reckon you can, mister.

526
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,252
- Right around behind.
- Come on.

527
00:44:31,597 --> 00:44:33,431
For Mrs. Marlowe. Marlowe?

528
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:37,244
Ain't you the Congressman that
was going to do so much for us

529
00:44:37,264 --> 00:44:39,144
- ranchers and then change your mind?
- Yes, but

530
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:41,196
then conditions were
misrepresented and...

531
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:45,389
You sure fixed it so I got to
haul water 20 Miles. None of you

532
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:46,806
get a drop.

533
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,264
Listen, that's not right.

534
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:55,806
We've got to have water.

535
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:09,181
Why didn't you help me

536
00:45:09,264 --> 00:45:10,504
- stop him?
- He has no right...

537
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:14,119
As much right as your company
had to refuse the ranchers water.

538
00:45:30,306 --> 00:45:34,431
Look, what is it? A cyclone?

539
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:38,681
- It's a dust storm and it's coming our way.
- What do we do? - You saw

540
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:42,077
pictures of one, Mr. Marlowe.
Now you're gonna see the real thing.

541
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:43,497
We've got to find shelter, come on!

542
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:15,177
Get the horses in the shed.

543
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:39,349
- Howdy, Roy.
- Where's your husband, Mrs. Larkin?

544
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:42,494
He's going to town for grub, he
ought to be back pretty soon.

545
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:43,514
Have you any water?

546
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:46,914
We have some now Mister, but the
cistern will be full of dust

547
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:48,056
after the storm.

548
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,139
Cistern? I thought you said the
Great Western pipeline ran

549
00:46:52,056 --> 00:46:53,696
through here. Well, I had been
informed...

550
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:56,786
Of course, the water company
wouldn't misinform anybody would

551
00:46:56,806 --> 00:46:57,806
- it?
- And

552
00:46:58,097 --> 00:47:00,417
the pump's in the corner right
over there. Help yourselves.

553
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:02,199
Anything we got here you're welcome to.

554
00:47:08,847 --> 00:47:10,447
You have dust pneumonia out here Rogers?

555
00:47:11,222 --> 00:47:14,014
No, you needn't worry. We don't
even have dust storms here. They

556
00:47:14,722 --> 00:47:15,181
haave them in another state.

557
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:16,722
You needn't rub it in.

558
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,139
I can't stand much more of this!

559
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:23,869
I thought you were the one who
wanted to see the dust storm?

560
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:24,889
Oh!

561
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:05,681
Folks, the dust storm's over.

562
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,014
What do we owe you, Mrs. Larkin?

563
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:12,889
Nay, sakes Mister. You don't owe
me nothing. Roy paid me yesterday.

564
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:15,256
But we weren't here yesterday.

565
00:48:16,222 --> 00:48:17,742
So the whole thing was a frame up, eh?

566
00:48:19,222 --> 00:48:21,681
Everything but the dust storm.
That was an added attraction.

567
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:25,744
- You mean the hold up and the water wagon were planned?
- That's

568
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:26,764
right.

569
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,431
I see nothing to laugh at.

570
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,041
Young man, I want to shake you
by the hand. Your methods are

571
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:43,431
not only unethical, they're
phenomenal. But don't you worry.

572
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:46,806
- I'll okay that water bill.
- Thanks!

573
00:48:56,514 --> 00:48:58,874
- Roy, the ranchers are headed to blow up the dam!
- Rogers,

574
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:02,286
- if they blast that damn, they lose government support.
- I'll

575
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,306
stop them!

576
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:22,295
Find Congressman Marlowe. Head
for the dam and step on it.

577
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:50,577
All right, Richars, thanks for
the warning. We'll teach them a

578
00:49:50,597 --> 00:49:51,597
lesson.

579
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:34,181
- There they are!
- Be smart and take cover!

580
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:05,139
Turn back! Get behind that hill!

581
00:51:12,347 --> 00:51:13,947
- Now that stopped them.
- We better stay

582
00:51:15,014 --> 00:51:18,054
- here a while and make sure.
- Yeah. Now that stopped them. - We better stay

583
00:51:27,972 --> 00:51:28,972
Did you see them?

584
00:51:29,764 --> 00:51:31,952
Yes, we turned them back. They've
gone over the hill. Man get back

585
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:32,972
here and get down.

586
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,009
They'll never get to the dam
now. Unhook that horse...

587
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:45,931
All we got to

588
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:49,608
do is turn that dynamite right
loose on that hill. Blast the dicks and

589
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:52,417
the water can't get to the dam.
Get that wagon in the road.

590
00:51:58,931 --> 00:51:59,971
That's the dynamite wagon.

591
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:07,764
- We've got to get out of here.
- No, wait.

592
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:39,571
- "I'm out to win a bigger stake and you can show me how."
- If you

593
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:46,556
want a happy life, just say yes and be
the wife of Rogers, the congressman!

594
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:05,847
Hey! Halt!
