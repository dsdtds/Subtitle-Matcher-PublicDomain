1
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:07,059
Just you wait, it won't be long

2
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:12,482
The man in black will soon be here

3
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:17,697
With his cleaver's blade so true

4
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:21,661
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

5
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:23,705
You're out.

6
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,693
I told you to stop singing
that awful song!

7
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:51,488
Didn't you hear me?

8
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:57,163
That same cursed song over and over!

9
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:23,069
Dear me, that's heavy.

10
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,222
What's the matter?

11
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:49,559
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song,

12
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:52,020
but they sing it all day long.

13
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:54,732
As if we haven't heard enough
of that murderer already.

14
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,359
Leave them alone.

15
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,821
As long as we can hear them singing,

16
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:01,366
at least we know
they're still there.

17
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:05,162
Yes, I guess you're right.

18
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:42,155
10,000 MARKS REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?

19
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,452
Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara
have been missing since June 11th.

20
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,998
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims of a crime

21
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,752
similar to that committed
last fall against the Doering siblings.

22
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:01,429
What a pretty ball you have there.

23
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,436
What's your name?

24
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,689
Elsie Beckmann.

25
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:39,808
Didn't Elsie come with you?

26
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:43,438
- No.
- She didn't come with us.

27
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,341
Pretty!

28
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,977
Thank you.

29
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,663
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.

30
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:34,125
Just a moment, Mr Gehrke.

31
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:39,297
Tell me, Mr Gehrke.

32
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,551
Have you seen little Elsie?

33
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:44,930
No. Didn't she just
come up the stairs?

34
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,808
No, she's not home yet.

35
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:50,979
She won't be long now.
Goodbye.

36
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,774
Goodbye, Mr Gehrke.

37
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:43,283
Extra! Extra!

38
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:03,724
No, I can't give change!
Extra!

39
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,354
Makes you afraid
to send your kids to school!

40
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,774
Who is the murderer?

41
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:22,079
Because the police
did not publish my first letter,

42
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:27,420
I am writing now
directly to the press!

43
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:32,592
Proceed with your investigations.

44
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:37,682
All will soon be confirmed.

45
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:42,688
But I'm not done yet!

46
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,191
10,000 MARKS REWARD

47
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:47,027
- Christ, here we go again!
- This is horrible!

48
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,532
The print's too small.
We can't read it.

49
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,578
You in front, read it out loud!

50
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,374
- Let him read!
- Hey! Quiet!

51
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,670
"The terror in our town
has found a new victim."

52
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:04,507
Louder!
We can't hear a word!

53
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:08,178
"Certain evidence leads us to believe

54
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:11,098
that this is the same murderer

55
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:14,644
who has already claimed eight victims
from among our city's children.

56
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,690
We must emphasise once again

57
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:21,276
that it is, now more than ever,
every mother and father's sacred duty

58
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:25,491
to alert their children
to this ever present danger

59
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:31,665
and to the friendly guise
it is likely to assume.

60
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,252
A little candy, a toy, or an apple

61
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:39,841
can suffice to lure a child
to his or her doom."

62
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:42,136
Very true!

63
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:45,389
Keep reading.

64
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,478
"Anxiety among the general public
is heightened

65
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:55,986
by the police's failure
to apprehend a suspect.

66
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:59,365
But the police are faced
with the almost impossible task

67
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:04,537
of catching a criminal who left
not the slightest clue behind.

68
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,708
Who is the murderer?

69
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,169
What does he look like?

70
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,795
Where is he hiding?

71
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:14,425
No one knows him,
yet he is among us.

72
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:18,305
Anybody sitting next to you
could be the murderer."

73
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:23,561
Yes, that's very true.

74
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:27,483
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.

75
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,026
What do I know very well?

76
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:33,740
Think about it.
It'll come to you.

77
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:36,160
What are you saying?

78
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:41,249
I saw you follow that little girl
from the fourth floor up the stairs.

79
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,212
You're crazy, you dirty swine!

80
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:47,590
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?

81
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,844
You bastard! You swine!

82
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,514
Murderer!

83
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:55,600
Gentlemen!

84
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:59,188
I'll see you in court!

85
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:02,067
I'll have you locked up!

86
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,907
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!

87
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,370
Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!

88
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,997
And the police fall for it!

89
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:15,500
A search warrant!

90
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,127
How awful!
What a disgrace!

91
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,464
Searching a man's house
based on an anonymous letter!

92
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,637
Mr Jager, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.

93
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:29,642
As if it weren't enough
that we're in constant fear for our kids!

94
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:34,314
You see? That's why the police
must follow up every lead.

95
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,819
Any man on the street
could be the murderer.

96
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,157
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

97
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:43,658
Yes, my child.

98
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,921
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?

99
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,426
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

100
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:01,097
Excuse me?

101
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,849
What do you want with that kid?

102
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:06,645
Absolutely nothing!

103
00:13:06,771 --> 00:13:09,273
What do you want with me?

104
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:10,775
I'll show you what I want!

105
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:14,405
Let me go!
This is an outrage!

106
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,699
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!

107
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:19,535
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.

108
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:22,874
- First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face!

109
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,374
then acting like a big shot!

110
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,422
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!

111
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:31,635
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?

112
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:34,846
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!

113
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,349
Call the police!

114
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:40,687
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!

115
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:46,736
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.

116
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:51,492
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!

117
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:54,037
What? Is he the murderer?

118
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:57,165
Break it up!
Come on, move along!

119
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,542
- The murderer!
- The monster!

120
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,463
Get him!

121
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,884
Tackle him!

122
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,774
Because the police
did not publish my first letter,

123
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,195
I am writing now
directly to the press!

124
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,698
Proceed with your investigations.

125
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:27,077
All will soon be confirmed.

126
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:30,831
But I'm not done yet!

127
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:34,127
This is a terrible scandal!

128
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:39,049
Lmagine the effect such a note
will have on the public, Commissioner!

129
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:42,470
This is simply irresponsible!

130
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,516
Mr Secretary,
we cannot stop the murderer

131
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:48,477
from writing to whomever he wishes!

132
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:52,899
This severely pathological man
probably takes great pleasure

133
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:57,447
in seeing his crimes
covered in the press.

134
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,200
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

135
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:02,661
and had them send us
the original letter.

136
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:05,165
The lab's working on it right now.

137
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:10,881
Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard

138
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,717
that's passed
through so many hands.

139
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:16,554
Nevertheless,
we will leave no stone unturned.

140
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,850
We'll painstakingly compare
the results against our archives

141
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:25,105
in hopes of finding something
that can be used to solve this case.

142
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:27,859
Then we'll send the letter
to our graphologist.

143
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:34,200
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped
and swelling sweeps,

144
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:40,541
clearly seen in the word 'soon',
third line from the bottom..."

145
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,628
- You got that?
- Yes.

146
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:49,135
"... attest to the strongly pathological
sexuality of this sex offender."

147
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:50,678
Full stop.

148
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:58,145
The partially disrupted and uneven style
of his other letters

149
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:01,316
is, in its interpretation,

150
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:05,071
a form of acting

151
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:11,871
which may manifest externally
as indolence or even lethargy.

152
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,794
The writing as a whole displays

153
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,969
elusive yet unmistakable signs

154
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:25,972
of madness.

155
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:31,019
Yes, of course, Commissioner.

156
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:35,817
I have no doubt you're doing your job,
and your men as well.

157
00:16:35,943 --> 00:16:37,902
But we need results!

158
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:39,822
Results!

159
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,456
Mr Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!

160
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,502
My riot squads
don't get a moment's peace.

161
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:57,093
They report for duty almost more fatigued
than when they were dismissed.

162
00:16:57,219 --> 00:17:01,640
Because the painstaking nature
of their work wears on the nerves,

163
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:06,396
and 80%, if not 90%,
of our leads are false.

164
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:09,817
The homicide squad doesn't even
get time to change clothes.

165
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:14,488
They're constantly on call,
always tense and alert.

166
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,910
Ever ready to spring into action,

167
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,662
to follow even the slightest lead,

168
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,917
as it just might be
the one that solves the case.

169
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:27,297
Mr Secretary, just consider
the search of the crime scene.

170
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,300
To give you an example,

171
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:35,514
in the bushes
just behind a picket fence,

172
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:41,940
a small, white, crumpled
paper wrapping was found.

173
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:46,277
It apparently once contained
inexpensive sweets.

174
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:48,531
In the outermost corner

175
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:51,785
were found traces of fruit drops

176
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:55,205
and particles of powdered sugar.

177
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:58,210
We've tried to trace the origin
of this wrapper

178
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:04,675
in every candy shop and grocery store
within a radius of a mile and a half,

179
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,594
but all to no avail.

180
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:11,517
With each passing day
we expand the area searched.

181
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,983
But, of course,
after such a long time,

182
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:23,240
no one remembers anything
that could serve as a lead.

183
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:26,786
Despite all these setbacks,

184
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:31,292
we're forced to press on
in our investigation,

185
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:33,085
always in uncertainty

186
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,381
and with little chance of success

187
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:40,386
in bringing the case
even one step closer to its conclusion.

188
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:41,929
Our men are doing everything...

189
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,599
What good is all this?

190
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,602
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling,

191
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:51,816
but that doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer

192
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:56,030
is terrorising
four and a half million people!

193
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,906
And the police are getting nowhere!

194
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:03,330
Mr Secretary, you don't seem
to have a clear picture

195
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:08,545
of the enormous obstacles
confronting our forces.

196
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,758
Do you realise, for example,

197
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,470
regarding the route
the child took home,

198
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:20,642
that there are fifteen conflicting
eyewitness accounts alone?

199
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,480
Let me give you a random example:

200
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:27,318
"Testimony 1,478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

201
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,612
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!

202
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:32,074
Gentlemen!

203
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,454
You must at least know the colour
of the cap the little girl wore

204
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,291
whom you say you saw
with the stranger!

205
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,377
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!

206
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:44,672
- It was green!
- Red!

207
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,099
Stop! This is pointless!

208
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:55,435
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!

209
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,270
Next witness.

210
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,817
If you rely
on a colour-blind man for clues,

211
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:03,404
don't be surprised
if you get nowhere!

212
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:06,448
In their hunt
for this unknown killer,

213
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:11,204
the police have tracked down
more than 1,500 detailed leads.

214
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,292
The files in this case
fill 60 thick volumes.

215
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,170
We've dispatched all our forces

216
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:20,425
to systematically comb
the area adjoining the city.

217
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:23,803
Every piece of undergrowth is scoured,
every thicket searched.

218
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,431
Every bush examined,

219
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,935
since any bush or hollow
could harbour some object

220
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,771
that could finally set us
on the right track.

221
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,275
We called in police dogs.

222
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,236
We set the best trackers
on the faintest of traces,

223
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,905
but they lost the scent

224
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,992
and failed to pick it up again
despite all efforts.

225
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,494
Since the first murders,

226
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,290
the police have searched
homeless shelters night after night,

227
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,545
subjecting everyone in them
to thorough scrutiny.

228
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,840
This does not, of course,
make the police very popular,

229
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,552
nor does it reduce
the general public's anxiety.

230
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:01,474
Railway stations are kept
under surveillance around the clock.

231
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,646
Still, the investigation has not yet
yielded the slightest results.

232
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:10,152
Nor have nightly raids
in the criminal districts.

233
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:43,432
The cops!

234
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,578
Get back!

235
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:03,332
- Back!
- This is the police!

236
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:14,053
Let me go, you dirty bastard!

237
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,098
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

238
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:20,436
Goddamn bastard!

239
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,731
Put me down!

240
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:26,234
Let me go!

241
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,445
Let her go, you filthy pig!

242
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:33,201
Quiet!

243
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:34,453
Move back!

244
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,747
The top fuzz!

245
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,500
Quiet!

246
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,544
Police orders:

247
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:45,091
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.

248
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,437
Please!

249
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:03,321
Come now, children,
stop this foolishness.

250
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:06,282
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!

251
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,841
Quiet!

252
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:22,846
That'll get you nowhere.

253
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:26,474
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!

254
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:31,690
Quiet!

255
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,652
Be reasonable now!
Step back!

256
00:24:36,612 --> 00:24:38,322
You hear me? Step back!

257
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:42,202
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!

258
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,997
- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.

259
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:47,667
Please let me go, Inspector!

260
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:50,713
The two guys who tried to escape
were caught on the Krangasse.

261
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,215
- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!

262
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:54,550
Have your papers ready!

263
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,511
- Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?

264
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,055
Off to the precinct again!

265
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:01,350
Haven't even made a buck tonight!

266
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:07,232
Anyone without papers
goes down to the precinct!

267
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:11,237
I tell you, I'm innocent, really!

268
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:12,572
Stop talking nonsense!

269
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,741
- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my arse!

270
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:17,828
- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?

271
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:19,079
Don't push.

272
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,750
Everyone will get their turn.

273
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:24,128
- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!

274
00:25:24,254 --> 00:25:26,798
Have your papers ready!

275
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,924
Your papers.

276
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,179
Inspector, I can't carry my birth certificate
around with me everywhere!

277
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,848
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!

278
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:35,600
The precinct for you!

279
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:37,728
You make me puke!

280
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:29,416
Shoddy work, my friend.

281
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:32,043
You've been had.

282
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:34,839
- Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!

283
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,342
Lay off!

284
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:39,136
Next.

285
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:42,891
Stuck-up snob.

286
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:01,413
What's wrong?

287
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:05,335
- Papa Lohmann...
nabbed him!

288
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:13,511
AT FURRIER'S

289
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,474
We'd better take you
down to the precinct too.

290
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,394
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.

291
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,854
Move on.

292
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,940
Move on!

293
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:24,232
Tough luck!

294
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,693
Next.

295
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,157
- Papers.
- Don't got none.

296
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,826
To the precinct.

297
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:34,746
Just my luck.

298
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:36,414
Next, come on.

299
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,549
You're ruining my business, Sarge.

300
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:54,843
These raids every night.

301
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:58,222
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.

302
00:28:58,348 --> 00:29:00,266
You think

303
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:04,564
we stay up all night
just for the hell of it?

304
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,774
No.

305
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,567
But you're drivin' away my clientele,

306
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:11,154
and you won't find the guy
you're lookin' for here anyway.

307
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:15,952
If you knew how steamed they are

308
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,372
at the guy who's causing these raids.

309
00:29:18,499 --> 00:29:19,873
Especially the girls.

310
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:23,212
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.

311
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:26,215
But believe me,

312
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:29,426
in every one of them
beats a mother's heart!

313
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:31,888
I know a lot of toughs

314
00:29:32,014 --> 00:29:36,060
who get all teary-eyed
just seein' the little ones at play.

315
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:40,398
If they ever get their hands
on that monster,

316
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:42,735
they'll make toothpicks out of him!

317
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:44,821
Ready to leave, Sergeant.

318
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:46,365
So long.

319
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,505
They hit the Crocodile Club today.

320
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,676
Two paddy wagons.

321
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,518
What's keeping Safecracker?

322
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:15,608
Is it 3:00 yet?

323
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:17,902
I'll find out.

324
00:30:22,952 --> 00:30:25,412
The exact time, please, miss.

325
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,292
2:58. Thank you.

326
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:50,610
2:58.

327
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:22,232
The cops are crawling
the streets like ants again.

328
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:25,443
Green coats wherever you spit.

329
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,863
They're on your back
even if you're with a broad.

330
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:31,326
They've gone nuts,
got this murderer on the brain.

331
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:35,289
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl,
and every night I have to check

332
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:39,710
under the bed to see
if the murderer's hiding there.

333
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:43,382
You can't do business anymore
for tripping over cops everywhere.

334
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:47,720
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.

335
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,307
What else is new?

336
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:59,735
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?

337
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:02,113
That guy? Come on.

338
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:07,495
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once
on a bank job he pulled in London.

339
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:11,249
There he was, hands up,
back to the wall

340
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:15,379
cops all around him.

341
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:17,924
Seconds later there were
three men dead on the ground,

342
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,760
but he wasn't one of them!

343
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:22,722
No one better
from Berlin to San Francisco.

344
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:26,018
They've been after him six years
and they've yet to get him.

345
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,980
Not yet. But put enough dogs
on the fox's tail...

346
00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:30,773
Can it!

347
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,910
Damn it!

348
00:32:42,581 --> 00:32:44,332
I can't take this!

349
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:48,253
He was always right on time before.

350
00:32:50,882 --> 00:32:52,799
- Thank God!
- Finally.

351
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:56,472
Morning!

352
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,099
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!

353
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,880
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.

354
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:29,844
I declare all division leaders
of this organisation present.

355
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,349
I assume you're authorised
to make binding decisions

356
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,976
for your divisions.

357
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,023
Good. We'll dispense
with the preliminaries,

358
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:41,819
as we all know why we're here.

359
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:46,783
An outsider is ruining
our business and our reputation.

360
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,452
Measures taken by the police

361
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:54,166
and the daily raids
to catch this child murderer

362
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:58,171
are hampering our activities
to an almost unbearable degree.

363
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,716
We can no longer tolerate the fact

364
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:05,806
that we're not safe now in any hotel,
bar, cafe or even private home

365
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:08,559
from the clutches of the police.

366
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:09,811
Very true.

367
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:12,188
This state of affairs must end.

368
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:16,026
Things must return to normal
or we'll go under.

369
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:19,865
Our coffers will soon be depleted.

370
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,910
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members

371
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:27,249
who currently enjoy room
and board at state expense,

372
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:32,797
I don't know where we'll find
the money to carry out our plans.

373
00:34:32,923 --> 00:34:35,091
Our reputation is suffering as well.

374
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:38,304
The police seek
the murderer in our fold.

375
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:42,350
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad,

376
00:34:42,477 --> 00:34:45,396
he knows the potential risks,
and so do I.

377
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:48,065
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.

378
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,069
But we must draw a firm line
between ourselves

379
00:34:51,196 --> 00:34:53,573
and this man they're looking for!

380
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:57,453
We conduct our business
in order to survive,

381
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,955
but this monster
has no right to survive!

382
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,500
He must be killed,
eliminated, exterminated!

383
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:05,128
Without mercy or compassion!

384
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:10,426
Gentlemen,

385
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:14,640
our members must be able
to go about their business again

386
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:19,980
without frantic cops
in their way at every turn.

387
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:21,524
I invite...

388
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:26,279
your views, gentlemen.

389
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:32,244
Step up ID checks,
comb the entire city,

390
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:37,083
and raids,
relentless, ever tougher raids!

391
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,171
We need informers!

392
00:35:40,297 --> 00:35:43,424
We must know the police's plans
almost before they do themselves!

393
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:45,761
The girls gotta work the cops more!

394
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:50,475
How often has one of us been nabbed
because his girl ratted on him to the cops?

395
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,352
Now they can rat on the cops!

396
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:56,899
Every resident, every landlord,

397
00:35:57,025 --> 00:36:00,612
every property owner

398
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:06,536
must be forced to consent
to meticulous searches of his property

399
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:10,165
for the slightest of clues.

400
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:14,838
What if we...
We have our connections.

401
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:20,344
What if we put
an article in the papers

402
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:25,143
that our syndicates,
I mean, our organisation,

403
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:29,063
doesn't wish to be lumped in
together with this pig,

404
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:32,234
and that the cops should look
for this guy somewhere else.

405
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,903
He's not even a real crook!

406
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,073
This man may well be,

407
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,621
when not engaged
in the actual act of killing,

408
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:47,502
a harmless, upstanding citizen
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

409
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:51,424
In his right mind, perhaps he plays
marbles with his landlady's kids

410
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,676
or plays cards with friends.

411
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:57,766
Without what I'll call

412
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:00,477
the innocuousness
of these murderers' private lives,

413
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:05,191
it's inconceivable that someone
like Grossmann or Haarmann

414
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:09,780
could have lived right next door
to their neighbours for years

415
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:13,576
without arousing
the faintest trace of suspicion!

416
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:16,664
This is where we must focus
the public's attention.

417
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,207
The public must cooperate.

418
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,046
I'll tell you about public cooperation!

419
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:26,342
Just thinking of it makes me puke.

420
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:28,969
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.

421
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:32,433
But ain't it the truth?

422
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:37,272
What the devil has public cooperation
gotten us so far?

423
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:41,902
Piles of letters
full of the most outrageous slander!

424
00:37:42,028 --> 00:37:43,196
Very true.

425
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:46,783
They alert homicide
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.

426
00:37:46,909 --> 00:37:48,201
That's right.

427
00:37:48,328 --> 00:37:51,915
But when you really want
reliable information from them,

428
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,084
then they suddenly haven't got a clue.

429
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,339
Why, they just can't seem
to remember a thing.

430
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:02,469
There's your public cooperation
for you!

431
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:06,516
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.

432
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:09,769
It can't really be that bad, can it?

433
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:13,065
But it is, Commissioner!

434
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:17,363
Most of the public
still takes the position,

435
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:19,991
"How does this concern me?".

436
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:24,246
The idea that
each individual is responsible

437
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:28,333
for what happens to the poorest,
most anonymous child on the street

438
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:32,464
hasn't even dawned
on the public at large!

439
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:37,095
I've got another idea.

440
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:39,347
There was this magician.

441
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:43,144
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.

442
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,440
Anyway, he could conjure up
hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.

443
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:50,195
The reward is still
far too little money.

444
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:56,118
The man who leads us
to the murderer should get a fortune.

445
00:38:56,244 --> 00:38:58,789
None of this is anything new.

446
00:38:58,915 --> 00:39:00,999
This is all leading nowhere.

447
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:05,379
So we just wait for the police
to catch the guy instead?

448
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:11,845
The difficulties
in solving crimes of this nature

449
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:15,767
are, in my experience,
often insurmountable,

450
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:18,062
since perpetrator and victim

451
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:22,192
are often brought together
by mere chance.

452
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,947
The instincts of the moment
drive the murderer's actions.

453
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,493
The victim is found and identified,

454
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,286
his or her last known whereabouts
are determined,

455
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,122
and then...

456
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:38,753
then comes the big question mark.

457
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:43,259
These children vanish
without a trace.

458
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,223
And when they're found...

459
00:39:51,854 --> 00:39:56,775
Well, we all know the state
in which we've found them.

460
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,699
And the perpetrator...

461
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,494
It's a fact well-known to all of us

462
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,875
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.

463
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:14,171
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.

464
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:18,135
The police have been after
this murderer for eight months now.

465
00:40:19,596 --> 00:40:22,557
- They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.

466
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,227
No, we'll go broke by then.

467
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:26,770
What, then?

468
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:46,044
We have to catch him...

469
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,880
ourselves.

470
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,931
Yes, that's what we must do.

471
00:40:57,184 --> 00:41:01,897
There is perhaps one other way.

472
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:05,233
I'm quite certain that information
on the individual in question

473
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,908
must already exist somewhere.

474
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:15,079
Being the severely pathological case
that he is,

475
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:19,918
he has no doubt already had some kind
of contact with the authorities.

476
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:24,382
That's why all health care facilities,

477
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:28,428
prisons, clinics and insane asylums

478
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:32,935
must be encouraged
to cooperate with us unequivocally.

479
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:36,188
We specifically need information

480
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:40,735
on those released after being deemed
harmless to society

481
00:41:40,861 --> 00:41:44,573
but who, due to their inclinations,

482
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,284
could be the murderer.

483
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:50,873
We must cover the city
with a net of informers.

484
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:56,129
Every square mile must be
under constant surveillance.

485
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:59,591
No child in this city must take
a single step without us knowing it.

486
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,137
- Fine, but how?
- And who?

487
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:05,975
It must be people who can go
anywhere without causing a stir,

488
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:09,145
follow anyone
without attracting attention,

489
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:13,483
follow any child to any house
without arousing suspicion.

490
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:17,864
In short, people whom the killer
would never suspect.

491
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,159
- But who?
- There are no such people!

492
00:42:20,285 --> 00:42:22,786
- Who could do that?
- Who?

493
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:28,335
The beggars.

494
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,006
The organisation of beggars!

495
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:12,138
Blood pudding's on the upswing.

496
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:17,270
God, this cheese stinks so good.

497
00:43:23,736 --> 00:43:25,863
Take that, you sons of bitches!

498
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,796
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.

499
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:50,393
Two, four, six...

500
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:11,752
Bread-and-butter sandwich,
lukewarm response.

501
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,594
Black Friday for roast beef.

502
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:40,371
All right.
Now come the courtyards.

503
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:45,002
Yes, from number 1 to 88.

504
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:50,091
Next.

505
00:44:54,514 --> 00:44:58,560
You're responsible for the courtyards
on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.

506
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:00,063
Got it.

507
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:01,688
What's next?

508
00:45:01,814 --> 00:45:07,613
Hauptstrasse,
from number 89... to 196.

509
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,282
Hauptstrasse,

510
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:14,956
number 89 to 196.

511
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:19,502
- Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.

512
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:38,275
Well, Emil, maybe
you'll win the 15,000.

513
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:41,112
I've got my fingers crossed.

514
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,530
Knock on wood.

515
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:27,460
My heartfelt thanks,
ladies and gentlemen.

516
00:46:29,504 --> 00:46:31,590
Thank you.

517
00:47:23,696 --> 00:47:27,033
In searching homes,
be on the lookout for any clue

518
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:30,913
which could establish the origin
of the murderer's letter to the Courier.

519
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:33,374
Be on the lookout as well

520
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,670
for an old wooden table...

521
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:37,796
Idiot!

522
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:46,265
or red pencil...

523
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:48,476
Come in.

524
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:54,107
or writing paper
of the type used by the killer.

525
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:59,071
Inspector, here are reports on mental
patients who've been released as cured

526
00:47:59,197 --> 00:48:02,160
or deemed harmless
over the last five years.

527
00:48:02,286 --> 00:48:04,412
Reports from every
private and public institute,

528
00:48:04,538 --> 00:48:08,166
as well as from
municipal hospitals and asylums.

529
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:24,269
And here's a list
of their present addresses.

530
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:03,025
Good day.
Does a Mr Beckert live here?

531
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:07,154
- Pardon me?
- Does a Mr Beckert live here?

532
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,493
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

533
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:15,374
You don't say.
Does a Mr Beckert live here?

534
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,045
Mr Beckert, yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.

535
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:24,008
I had hoped to speak with him.

536
00:49:24,134 --> 00:49:26,595
I'm from the tax office.

537
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:29,140
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!

538
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,852
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...

539
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:34,146
Yes, thank you.

540
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:45,034
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

541
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,470
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.

542
00:50:04,475 --> 00:50:06,561
Tell me, Mrs Winkler,

543
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:09,314
does Mr Beckert
subscribe to any newspapers?

544
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,235
Mr Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.

545
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:16,448
I see. Thank you.

546
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:32,646
Mummy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!

547
00:53:32,771 --> 00:53:35,482
Child, you mustn't do that.

548
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,442
You know why.

549
00:54:21,873 --> 00:54:23,958
Good day.
What would you like?

550
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:26,044
Coffee.

551
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,506
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.

552
00:54:55,164 --> 00:54:56,623
Here you are.

553
00:55:02,422 --> 00:55:04,091
Another.

554
00:55:37,924 --> 00:55:39,759
The bill.

555
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:42,971
Two cognacs...
That's 1.65, please.

556
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,435
Thank you very much.

557
00:55:53,193 --> 00:55:56,946
"Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier

558
00:55:57,073 --> 00:55:59,825
Polished mahogany,
with tablecloth.

559
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:03,787
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.

560
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:07,752
Printed matter found in wastebasket:
Cigar ad and a postcard

561
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:10,087
with flowers
and 'Regards, Paul' on it,

562
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:11,840
but no address of sender.

563
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:15,510
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand,
a bag of candy..."

564
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,975
Just a moment.

565
00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:26,399
Ariston?

566
00:56:37,663 --> 00:56:39,664
What was that?

567
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:54,225
I'd like the file
on the Marga Perl murder case.

568
00:56:57,187 --> 00:56:59,106
Thank you very much.

569
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:08,659
That's odd.

570
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:12,873
I've heard that before.

571
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:21,842
It was...

572
00:57:41,743 --> 00:57:43,827
Hey, Heinrich!

573
00:57:49,168 --> 00:57:51,252
What is it?

574
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:56,677
- What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.

575
00:57:57,762 --> 00:57:59,596
Can't you hear it?

576
00:57:59,722 --> 00:58:01,474
There.

577
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,688
Now he's stopped.

578
00:58:06,773 --> 00:58:09,234
Did you see
the guy who was whistling?

579
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,569
Yes, I can still see him.

580
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:17,201
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl
and walking her down the street.

581
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:21,456
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?

582
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:26,003
The day little Elsie Beckmann
was killed,

583
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,716
a man bought a balloon from me.

584
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:32,512
He was with a little girl...

585
00:58:35,975 --> 00:58:41,148
and he whistled just like that!

586
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:10,714
Damn it, man!

587
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:13,844
Are you crazy,
throwing orange peels on the ground?

588
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,973
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!

589
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,059
I should report you to the police!

590
01:00:19,184 --> 01:00:21,394
Outrageous behaviour!

591
01:00:24,107 --> 01:00:25,817
Hey, mister.

592
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:40,793
Here it is.

593
01:00:40,919 --> 01:00:46,633
"In a 150-foot radius
of the crime scene,

594
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:50,722
three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand
were found." There you have it.

595
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:54,894
Yes, it may be
the same brand of cigarettes,

596
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,023
but there was no old wooden table.

597
01:00:58,149 --> 01:01:04,155
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else.

598
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,245
Good God!

599
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,082
The window ledge!

600
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,101
You're right.

601
01:01:30,188 --> 01:01:32,231
Just a minute.

602
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:40,950
Red pencil.

603
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:45,997
My God, finally!

604
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,502
We're finally on his trail.

605
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:54,257
What?

606
01:01:54,384 --> 01:01:56,552
They're on his trail?

607
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,224
- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.

608
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,726
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.

609
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:04,311
Shut up!

610
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,606
What did you say?

611
01:02:06,732 --> 01:02:10,861
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.

612
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:14,907
His every move is being watched.

613
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:24,159
- Mister.
- What is it?

614
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:27,746
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?

615
01:03:27,872 --> 01:03:29,999
On your shoulder.

616
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:36,465
Here, I'll wipe it off.

617
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:46,019
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.

618
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:20,843
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.

619
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:22,178
Out of the question!

620
01:05:22,304 --> 01:05:26,308
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!

621
01:05:30,439 --> 01:05:33,650
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building.

622
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,260
Closing time!

623
01:05:55,386 --> 01:05:59,640
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...

624
01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:01,058
They're starting to come out!

625
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:04,020
Out in the street,
and keep your eyes peeled!

626
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:14,450
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

627
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:18,288
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Konigsberg...

628
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:23,085
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...

629
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:26,089
The boss came to my office today...

630
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,177
Turn off the light.

631
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:33,764
He'll get suspicious
if he comes home and sees it on.

632
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:40,399
What time is it, anyway?

633
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,902
Almost 6:30.

634
01:07:01,633 --> 01:07:04,011
He's gotta still be inside!

635
01:07:04,137 --> 01:07:07,556
He definitely didn't come out
with the office crowd.

636
01:07:15,108 --> 01:07:17,485
No, just a moment.

637
01:07:18,154 --> 01:07:20,947
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.

638
01:07:21,074 --> 01:07:23,909
They figure the guy's hiding
in the building.

639
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:34,924
What sort of building is it?

640
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,802
Nothing but offices.

641
01:07:38,845 --> 01:07:41,431
I don't know what's in the basement.

642
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,727
There's a branch of the local
savings bank on the ground floor,

643
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:49,233
and the second to sixth floors
are nothing but offices.

644
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:50,734
Above that is the attic space.

645
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,827
This is unbelievable.

646
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:02,373
Anyone still in there?

647
01:08:10,008 --> 01:08:11,844
Anyone still in here?

648
01:08:30,492 --> 01:08:32,368
What the devil!

649
01:08:32,911 --> 01:08:34,788
Anybody still in here?

650
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:46,886
Damn carelessness!

651
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:51,725
All that trouble for one door.

652
01:09:14,545 --> 01:09:16,379
Seems the guy's cornered now.

653
01:09:16,506 --> 01:09:19,134
I think we should tip
the cops off right away.

654
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,262
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!

655
01:09:22,931 --> 01:09:27,144
Stay by the phone
and call back in a few minutes.

656
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:28,478
What is it?

657
01:09:28,604 --> 01:09:31,190
Are you crazy or something?
The police?

658
01:09:31,316 --> 01:09:34,068
No! We're gonna get
this guy ourselves!

659
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:36,112
Listen, the time now is...

660
01:09:37,114 --> 01:09:38,198
8:00.

661
01:09:38,324 --> 01:09:42,787
All right. 9:00, 10:00...

662
01:09:43,288 --> 01:09:44,289
At 11:00!

663
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,823
Evening. Did you know
your gate isn't closed?

664
01:10:11,949 --> 01:10:15,159
What? That's impossible!

665
01:10:15,286 --> 01:10:18,999
Why I just... Wait, it is!

666
01:10:21,043 --> 01:10:23,878
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!

667
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:26,257
Come on! Move it!

668
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:28,510
Let's go!

669
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:30,679
Come on, move it!

670
01:10:58,464 --> 01:11:01,133
How many other watchmen
are in the building?

671
01:11:03,887 --> 01:11:06,264
Don't want to answer?

672
01:11:07,642 --> 01:11:09,393
Very well.

673
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,270
There are still two watchmen
on their rounds.

674
01:12:08,674 --> 01:12:10,719
Goddamn it!

675
01:12:10,845 --> 01:12:13,722
Damn piece of crap!

676
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:22,732
Goddamned lock!

677
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,626
Damn it to hell!

678
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:40,504
Shit!

679
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:38,032
Careful where you shine those lights!

680
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:40,828
And don't stomp around
like elephants!

681
01:13:40,954 --> 01:13:42,830
He's not in the basement.

682
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:45,875
We went through it all
and found nothing.

683
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:49,296
Two men are still going
through the boiler room.

684
01:13:49,422 --> 01:13:50,631
Hold it!

685
01:13:50,757 --> 01:13:52,259
This is the last one.

686
01:13:52,385 --> 01:13:55,262
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.

687
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,314
Safecracker sent me.

688
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,942
All right.

689
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:07,861
Listen carefully.

690
01:14:07,987 --> 01:14:12,658
This is a new type of time clock.

691
01:14:13,368 --> 01:14:15,620
Here's a general diagram.

692
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:18,164
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,

693
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:22,128
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station. Get it?

694
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,758
You got it?

695
01:14:26,885 --> 01:14:29,846
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...

696
01:14:31,473 --> 01:14:35,060
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal room.

697
01:14:35,186 --> 01:14:37,521
We turned over every piece of coal.

698
01:14:40,651 --> 01:14:44,780
Hey!
Are you nuts?

699
01:14:44,907 --> 01:14:49,829
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?

700
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,834
We gotta get in if we're gonna
search the whole place!

701
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,254
But not through the door, you idiot!

702
01:14:57,380 --> 01:14:59,841
Go through the ceiling
of the office above!

703
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:08,100
Nothing.

704
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:46,188
All right. Down we go.

705
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:38,879
Hey, what's up?

706
01:16:39,005 --> 01:16:40,379
Hey! What is it?

707
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:42,799
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!

708
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:45,470
- What's going on?
- I heard some banging!

709
01:16:46,805 --> 01:16:49,725
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?

710
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,733
Wait, damn it!

711
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,695
I've gotta see Safecracker!

712
01:17:00,363 --> 01:17:04,159
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!

713
01:17:21,181 --> 01:17:22,681
Quiet!

714
01:18:11,826 --> 01:18:14,411
Go on! He has to be in there!

715
01:18:15,581 --> 01:18:17,248
Here's the light switch.

716
01:18:19,168 --> 01:18:21,044
Force the locks.

717
01:18:21,171 --> 01:18:23,005
Come on. Hurry up!

718
01:18:34,269 --> 01:18:38,065
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!

719
01:18:38,192 --> 01:18:40,443
I heard someone banging,
and I told Safecracker.

720
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:43,822
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.

721
01:18:43,948 --> 01:18:46,033
Just came down to fill you in.

722
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:49,245
If I hadn't been alert,
we could've looked for him for hours!

723
01:18:49,371 --> 01:18:50,581
The watchman!

724
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:58,673
Three... one... four.

725
01:18:58,799 --> 01:19:00,592
314.

726
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:14,693
- Everybody out!
- What?

727
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:18,864
- The cops will be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called them?

728
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:21,368
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!

729
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:23,037
Hold it!

730
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,664
Quiet down!

731
01:19:25,374 --> 01:19:28,001
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.

732
01:19:28,127 --> 01:19:30,588
Move it! Get going!

733
01:19:30,714 --> 01:19:33,925
Not like that!
Out of the way!

734
01:19:40,934 --> 01:19:43,186
- He's not in here.
- Next door!

735
01:19:43,854 --> 01:19:45,481
Come on! Faster!

736
01:19:50,321 --> 01:19:53,241
- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!

737
01:19:59,456 --> 01:20:02,919
Quickly! We've only got
three minutes left!

738
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:06,256
No padlock on this one...
He must be here!

739
01:20:06,382 --> 01:20:07,425
Open it!

740
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:09,384
- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!

741
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,512
Hurry! Only one minute left!

742
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:18,521
There he is, the dog!

743
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,441
Come on! Move it!

744
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:24,862
Everybody out!

745
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:28,283
Get out while you can, damn it!

746
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:30,243
Move it!

747
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,749
For Christ's sake, get going!

748
01:20:35,918 --> 01:20:37,711
- What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!

749
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:42,842
If not, they might as well stay here,
with or without the guy!

750
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:46,055
What in the hell is keeping them?

751
01:20:46,181 --> 01:20:48,349
Finally! Thank God!

752
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:53,230
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!

753
01:21:27,272 --> 01:21:29,566
He's not down here.

754
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:34,363
Hey! Who pulled up the rope?

755
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:39,412
Hey, who pulled up the rope?

756
01:21:41,206 --> 01:21:43,082
Bunch of morons!

757
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,718
Hello there.

758
01:21:58,845 --> 01:22:00,555
Hands up!

759
01:22:00,681 --> 01:22:04,267
How can I put my hands up
when I'm holding on to the rope?

760
01:22:04,393 --> 01:22:06,228
Come out of there!

761
01:22:16,074 --> 01:22:18,075
I'm really innocent this time...

762
01:22:19,287 --> 01:22:20,912
like a newborn babe.

763
01:22:25,377 --> 01:22:27,712
This may surprise you, Franz...

764
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:30,841
but I believe you.

765
01:22:34,262 --> 01:22:39,101
Then everything's in order,
and I can go now, right?

766
01:22:39,226 --> 01:22:41,271
Just a moment.

767
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:45,317
Cigarette?

768
01:22:45,443 --> 01:22:46,903
Uh-oh.

769
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,253
I'll take your word for it, Franz,

770
01:23:02,631 --> 01:23:09,472
provided you can tell me

771
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:15,020
who the man was
that you were looking for

772
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:18,398
and that you found in that building.

773
01:23:18,524 --> 01:23:20,568
I don't understand, Inspector.

774
01:23:21,488 --> 01:23:23,489
A man, you say?

775
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:30,038
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.

776
01:23:30,164 --> 01:23:32,708
I know nothing.

777
01:23:32,834 --> 01:23:35,211
Nothing at all.

778
01:23:35,337 --> 01:23:37,256
Of course.

779
01:23:37,881 --> 01:23:40,175
There's just one thing I don't get:

780
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:44,180
Why you're covering up for the gang
who left you in the lurch.

781
01:23:46,184 --> 01:23:49,270
Fine friends, running off
when things heat up,

782
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:51,523
leaving you right in the fire.

783
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:53,692
Phooey!

784
01:23:55,946 --> 01:24:00,533
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.

785
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,526
Listen...

786
01:24:34,284 --> 01:24:36,745
What can happen to me anyway?

787
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:40,540
Maybe a little property damage,
so what?

788
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:42,084
Nothing was pinched!

789
01:24:42,211 --> 01:24:44,379
But something was pinched,
my friend!

790
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:45,964
In fact, a good deal.

791
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:49,218
What? Something got pinched?

792
01:24:50,763 --> 01:24:52,096
How much?

793
01:24:52,222 --> 01:24:55,976
Tell me what you know
and I'll do the same.

794
01:24:56,102 --> 01:24:59,105
I already told you.
I know nothing.

795
01:25:01,317 --> 01:25:03,110
Very well.

796
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:08,617
Give it some thought, Franz.

797
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:16,126
Leave a man alone
for a couple hours

798
01:25:16,795 --> 01:25:21,841
and a lot comes back to him
that he couldn't remember before.

799
01:25:24,303 --> 01:25:26,138
Take him away.

800
01:25:41,658 --> 01:25:43,993
Send the night watchman in.

801
01:25:46,831 --> 01:25:48,833
Mr Damowatz.

802
01:25:55,759 --> 01:25:57,592
Please sit down.

803
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:04,017
Now then, you said
in your statement...

804
01:26:04,144 --> 01:26:08,481
Listen carefully, in case
you have to testify under oath later.

805
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:16,450
You clearly heard one of the burglars
say to the guy guarding you,

806
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:20,663
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic."

807
01:26:20,789 --> 01:26:23,666
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.

808
01:26:25,336 --> 01:26:29,590
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.

809
01:26:32,471 --> 01:26:33,845
Good.

810
01:26:33,971 --> 01:26:36,432
Go home now
and recover from your ordeal.

811
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:39,603
But please remain available
for further questioning.

812
01:26:39,729 --> 01:26:42,063
Of course, Inspector.

813
01:26:44,359 --> 01:26:46,110
Good morning, Inspector.

814
01:26:46,236 --> 01:26:47,821
Morning.

815
01:27:01,338 --> 01:27:04,675
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann
in the building?

816
01:27:05,761 --> 01:27:09,056
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.

817
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:11,642
I'll come over myself.

818
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:17,566
What? I see.

819
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:20,486
Hasn't come home yet, eh?

820
01:27:21,446 --> 01:27:24,157
Did you keep an eye
on the old Winkler woman too?

821
01:27:24,283 --> 01:27:25,992
Come in.

822
01:27:26,452 --> 01:27:28,079
Come in!

823
01:27:29,205 --> 01:27:31,959
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.

824
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:35,713
Listen, the whole block
is surrounded.

825
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:39,551
If he decides to go home,
he has to run into us.

826
01:27:39,677 --> 01:27:42,721
So just keep on waiting.

827
01:27:42,847 --> 01:27:45,850
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.

828
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,816
Damn it!

829
01:27:58,033 --> 01:27:59,951
What do you want?

830
01:28:00,077 --> 01:28:02,287
I wanted...

831
01:28:03,456 --> 01:28:05,708
to ask a favour of you.

832
01:28:08,754 --> 01:28:10,756
Dishwater again!

833
01:28:10,882 --> 01:28:13,675
I wanted to ask you...

834
01:28:13,801 --> 01:28:16,721
Read this first.

835
01:28:22,855 --> 01:28:24,522
- A statement?
- Yeah.

836
01:28:25,441 --> 01:28:27,859
An office building was broken into.

837
01:28:35,078 --> 01:28:36,912
Bennostrasse?

838
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:39,333
That's a respectable part of town.

839
01:28:40,793 --> 01:28:43,670
Perhaps not that respectable after all.

840
01:28:44,964 --> 01:28:47,008
Hell, this is getting serious!

841
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,606
What the...
Did they mean to empty the brothel?

842
01:28:59,566 --> 01:29:02,736
What could they have been
looking for in the coal?

843
01:29:04,197 --> 01:29:06,949
Incredible! Unbelievable!

844
01:29:10,204 --> 01:29:12,080
I'll be damned!

845
01:29:15,586 --> 01:29:17,837
This is madness!

846
01:29:20,509 --> 01:29:24,179
So they were after
the savings bank!

847
01:29:25,264 --> 01:29:27,391
Good God!
What could this mean?

848
01:29:29,269 --> 01:29:31,604
I don't understand at all.

849
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:33,982
They didn't even touch it?

850
01:29:34,109 --> 01:29:37,862
Must've been a bunch of real idiots!

851
01:29:39,782 --> 01:29:41,825
I'll be damned!

852
01:29:41,951 --> 01:29:44,412
Isn't that something?

853
01:29:44,538 --> 01:29:47,873
Nothing stolen,
but a man was carried off.

854
01:29:47,999 --> 01:29:50,128
God knows where they took him.

855
01:29:50,253 --> 01:29:51,878
That's just great.

856
01:29:52,004 --> 01:29:54,841
And Franz isn't talking.

857
01:29:54,968 --> 01:29:57,176
He's afraid, of course.

858
01:29:57,302 --> 01:30:01,725
I know him well. Guys like him would
rather jump out the fifth-floor window

859
01:30:01,851 --> 01:30:04,394
than be mixed up in a murder rap.

860
01:30:05,813 --> 01:30:11,360
What if we could
get at him from that angle?

861
01:30:12,405 --> 01:30:16,492
Lohmann, if you'd be willing
to help me out...

862
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,415
Very clever.

863
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:24,002
I see the wheels turning.

864
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,465
Let's send for this Franz.

865
01:30:32,388 --> 01:30:34,473
You're wanted for questioning.

866
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:38,561
What? They sent four guys for me?

867
01:30:38,687 --> 01:30:41,732
- What's this about?
- Move it!

868
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:07,763
"Homicide squad.

869
01:31:07,889 --> 01:31:11,976
Inspector Karl Lohmann."

870
01:31:17,192 --> 01:31:19,568
What do you want with me?

871
01:31:19,694 --> 01:31:22,739
What have I got to do
with the homicide squad?

872
01:31:33,796 --> 01:31:35,630
Yes, young man,

873
01:31:36,716 --> 01:31:38,801
your case has been turned over to me.

874
01:31:42,765 --> 01:31:44,474
But why?

875
01:31:47,311 --> 01:31:48,938
Why?

876
01:31:50,275 --> 01:31:54,195
You boys did your work
a little too well.

877
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,664
One of the watchmen...

878
01:32:12,468 --> 01:32:14,093
Dead?

879
01:32:18,726 --> 01:32:21,103
Accessory to murder.

880
01:32:22,314 --> 01:32:23,689
Nasty business.

881
01:32:23,815 --> 01:32:26,902
Inspector, I've had enough!

882
01:32:27,028 --> 01:32:29,029
I want no part of this!

883
01:32:29,155 --> 01:32:32,992
I'll tell you everything I know!

884
01:32:33,118 --> 01:32:35,495
Very sensible,
but, unfortunately, too late.

885
01:32:35,622 --> 01:32:38,498
It can't be too late!

886
01:32:38,625 --> 01:32:41,210
It can't be!

887
01:32:41,337 --> 01:32:44,131
I'll tell you everything!

888
01:32:44,257 --> 01:32:47,801
Even what we were looking for
in that damn building.

889
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:49,554
Well...

890
01:32:50,723 --> 01:32:53,225
The child murderer!

891
01:33:03,155 --> 01:33:04,530
What?

892
01:33:05,491 --> 01:33:06,867
Who?

893
01:33:06,993 --> 01:33:09,536
The child murderer, Inspector.

894
01:33:15,544 --> 01:33:17,171
Just a moment.

895
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:37,904
This had to happen to me!

896
01:33:41,284 --> 01:33:43,954
Me, of all people.

897
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:53,924
Come sit down, my boy.

898
01:33:57,763 --> 01:34:02,308
We're gonna level
with each other, got it?

899
01:34:02,435 --> 01:34:03,978
Certainly, Inspector.

900
01:34:04,104 --> 01:34:06,773
And God help you
if you pull something.

901
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:09,276
Now then,

902
01:34:09,402 --> 01:34:12,196
what have you boys got to do
with the murderer

903
01:34:12,322 --> 01:34:14,907
and where was the guy taken?

904
01:34:17,287 --> 01:34:20,457
Well, Inspector...

905
01:34:21,709 --> 01:34:25,796
you know the old
Kuntz & Ley distillery?

906
01:34:26,631 --> 01:34:29,467
The one that went belly-up
in the Depression?

907
01:34:29,593 --> 01:34:30,635
That's the one.

908
01:34:30,762 --> 01:34:35,183
Since then, the building's stood empty,
and no one gives a damn about it.

909
01:34:55,584 --> 01:34:58,336
Get out here! Move it!

910
01:35:00,799 --> 01:35:03,342
Let me go!

911
01:35:11,186 --> 01:35:13,229
What have I done to you?

912
01:35:13,355 --> 01:35:14,481
You swine!

913
01:35:14,607 --> 01:35:18,027
Let go of me!

914
01:35:20,197 --> 01:35:23,157
Bastards!

915
01:35:23,827 --> 01:35:26,746
Swine!
What do you want from me?

916
01:35:26,872 --> 01:35:29,833
What do you want...

917
01:35:58,702 --> 01:36:00,036
Help!

918
01:36:00,163 --> 01:36:04,249
Help! Let me out of here!

919
01:36:04,376 --> 01:36:06,711
I want out!

920
01:36:06,837 --> 01:36:08,963
Let me out of here!

921
01:36:09,089 --> 01:36:11,008
You'll never get out of here.

922
01:36:13,045 --> 01:36:15,672
Gentlemen, I beg of you!

923
01:36:15,798 --> 01:36:18,885
I don't even know
what you want with me.

924
01:36:19,011 --> 01:36:21,178
I beg you, let me go.

925
01:36:21,306 --> 01:36:25,101
This whole thing must be a mistake!

926
01:36:25,768 --> 01:36:27,478
A mis...

927
01:36:29,481 --> 01:36:30,940
No.

928
01:36:31,484 --> 01:36:34,654
No mistake.
Out of the question.

929
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:37,657
This is no mistake.

930
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:44,498
No.

931
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:47,002
No mistake.

932
01:36:51,216 --> 01:36:53,134
You recognise this?

933
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:57,765
You bought a balloon just like this
for little Elsie Beckmann.

934
01:36:57,892 --> 01:36:59,976
Just like this one.

935
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:07,110
No!

936
01:37:08,404 --> 01:37:12,116
Where did you bury
little Marga Perl, you bastard?

937
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:19,083
But I never...

938
01:37:19,209 --> 01:37:21,795
I never even met her!

939
01:37:24,298 --> 01:37:26,717
You never even met her!

940
01:37:28,887 --> 01:37:31,181
I suppose you never
met her either?

941
01:37:32,892 --> 01:37:34,268
Or her?

942
01:37:37,064 --> 01:37:39,483
You never met her either?

943
01:37:39,943 --> 01:37:41,610
- Stop him!
- Grab him!

944
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:43,779
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

945
01:37:43,905 --> 01:37:46,491
Watch out! The door!

946
01:37:46,617 --> 01:37:49,120
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!

947
01:37:49,246 --> 01:37:52,082
Let go of me!

948
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:17,404
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!

949
01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:20,742
You have no right to hold me here!

950
01:38:20,868 --> 01:38:24,245
Right? There's only one thing
right for a man like you... death!

951
01:38:24,371 --> 01:38:26,540
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!

952
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:28,625
- Lce him!
- Let him have it!

953
01:38:28,752 --> 01:38:30,336
Quiet!

954
01:38:30,463 --> 01:38:32,465
Kill him!

955
01:38:41,518 --> 01:38:44,187
You spoke of right just now.

956
01:38:45,355 --> 01:38:47,608
We will be your right.

957
01:38:48,818 --> 01:38:52,489
Everyone sitting here
is an expert in the rule of law!

958
01:38:55,159 --> 01:39:00,999
From six weeks in Tegel prison
to 15 years in Brandenburg.

959
01:39:03,503 --> 01:39:07,006
They'll make sure
you get your rights.

960
01:39:08,301 --> 01:39:10,511
You'll even have defence counsel.

961
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:13,389
Everything according
to the letter of the law.

962
01:39:14,057 --> 01:39:16,017
Defence counsel?

963
01:39:16,143 --> 01:39:19,105
I need no defence counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?

964
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:21,357
You, perhaps?

965
01:39:23,528 --> 01:39:24,903
Hey, you.

966
01:39:25,029 --> 01:39:28,824
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.

967
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:33,622
Your head's at stake here,
in case you hadn't noticed.

968
01:39:33,748 --> 01:39:36,458
And just who are you?

969
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:43,384
I have the dubious pleasure
of serving as your defence.

970
01:39:44,052 --> 01:39:46,930
Though I'm afraid
it won't do you much good.

971
01:39:48,724 --> 01:39:52,895
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?

972
01:39:53,564 --> 01:39:57,234
We simply want to put you
out of commission.

973
01:39:58,153 --> 01:40:00,488
And we'll only be sure
of that when you're dead.

974
01:40:00,614 --> 01:40:03,533
But you can't murder me
just like that!

975
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:10,041
I demand to be handed over
to the police!

976
01:40:13,171 --> 01:40:17,759
I demand to be brought
before a real court of law!

977
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,971
That's a good one!

978
01:40:21,097 --> 01:40:23,808
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!

979
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:26,812
So you can plead insanity

980
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,983
and spend the rest of your life
being cared for by the state.

981
01:40:30,109 --> 01:40:34,446
And then you break out of the asylum
or receive a pardon,

982
01:40:34,572 --> 01:40:38,492
and you're happy as can be,
free to kill with impunity,

983
01:40:38,619 --> 01:40:42,331
protected by law
on grounds of insanity

984
01:40:42,457 --> 01:40:46,669
and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!

985
01:40:46,795 --> 01:40:49,506
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!

986
01:40:50,342 --> 01:40:53,677
But I can't help it!

987
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,186
I can't...

988
01:41:00,312 --> 01:41:05,651
I really can't... help it!

989
01:41:07,988 --> 01:41:09,697
We know that one!

990
01:41:09,823 --> 01:41:12,868
Before the judge,
we all "can't help it".

991
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:21,254
What would you know?

992
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:23,799
What are you talking about?

993
01:41:23,925 --> 01:41:26,718
Who are you anyway?

994
01:41:26,843 --> 01:41:28,720
Who are you?

995
01:41:28,846 --> 01:41:31,140
All of you.

996
01:41:31,267 --> 01:41:33,142
Criminals.

997
01:41:34,062 --> 01:41:36,939
Probably proud of it, too.

998
01:41:37,065 --> 01:41:39,067
Proud you can crack a safe

999
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:42,404
or sneak into houses
or cheat at cards.

1000
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:46,784
All of which it seems to me
you could just as easily give up

1001
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:49,371
if you had learned something useful,

1002
01:41:49,497 --> 01:41:54,502
or if you had jobs
or if you weren't such lazy pigs.

1003
01:41:55,547 --> 01:41:57,422
But me?

1004
01:41:57,549 --> 01:42:01,720
Can I do anything about it?

1005
01:42:01,846 --> 01:42:06,599
Don't I have
this cursed thing inside me?

1006
01:42:06,726 --> 01:42:09,980
This fire, this voice, this agony?

1007
01:42:13,736 --> 01:42:18,574
So you mean to say
you have to kill?

1008
01:42:23,748 --> 01:42:27,668
I have to roam the streets endlessly,

1009
01:42:27,793 --> 01:42:32,923
always sensing
that someone's following me.

1010
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:34,801
It's me!

1011
01:42:34,927 --> 01:42:37,137
I'm shadowing myself!

1012
01:42:38,097 --> 01:42:42,977
Silently... but I still hear it!

1013
01:42:43,104 --> 01:42:47,400
Yes, sometimes I feel

1014
01:42:47,526 --> 01:42:49,986
like I'm tracking myself down.

1015
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,491
I want to run,
run away from myself!

1016
01:42:53,617 --> 01:42:56,160
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!

1017
01:42:56,286 --> 01:43:00,415
I must take the path
that it's driving me down

1018
01:43:00,541 --> 01:43:05,172
and run and run
down endless streets!

1019
01:43:05,298 --> 01:43:07,966
I want off!

1020
01:43:09,177 --> 01:43:12,555
And with me run the ghosts

1021
01:43:12,681 --> 01:43:16,102
of the mothers and children.

1022
01:43:16,228 --> 01:43:20,147
They never go away.
They're always there!

1023
01:43:20,273 --> 01:43:24,779
Always!

1024
01:43:24,905 --> 01:43:29,326
Except when I'm doing it.

1025
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:31,912
When I...

1026
01:43:39,381 --> 01:43:42,341
Then I don't remember a thing.

1027
01:43:43,302 --> 01:43:47,473
Then I'm standing before a poster,

1028
01:43:47,599 --> 01:43:50,060
reading what I've done.

1029
01:43:50,186 --> 01:43:53,147
I read and read...

1030
01:43:53,273 --> 01:43:55,733
I did that?

1031
01:43:55,860 --> 01:43:58,945
I don't remember a thing!

1032
01:43:59,071 --> 01:44:01,031
But who will believe me?

1033
01:44:01,158 --> 01:44:04,244
Who knows what it's like inside me?

1034
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:09,417
How it screams and cries out
inside me when I have to do it!

1035
01:44:09,543 --> 01:44:14,465
Don't want to! Must!

1036
01:44:14,591 --> 01:44:20,263
And then a voice cries out,
and I can't listen anymore!

1037
01:44:20,389 --> 01:44:23,476
Help! I can't!

1038
01:44:23,602 --> 01:44:27,147
I can't!

1039
01:44:32,404 --> 01:44:37,743
The accused has stated
that he can't help himself.

1040
01:44:37,869 --> 01:44:41,664
In other words,
he must commit murder.

1041
01:44:43,835 --> 01:44:46,212
With that he has pronounced
his own death sentence.

1042
01:44:46,338 --> 01:44:47,713
Right!

1043
01:44:47,839 --> 01:44:51,218
A man who claims

1044
01:44:51,344 --> 01:44:54,679
that he's compelled
to destroy the lives of others,

1045
01:44:54,805 --> 01:44:58,935
such a man must be
extinguished like a bonfire!

1046
01:44:59,062 --> 01:45:01,146
Such a man must be obliterated!

1047
01:45:01,272 --> 01:45:02,982
Wiped out!

1048
01:45:11,744 --> 01:45:13,995
May I address the court?

1049
01:45:14,121 --> 01:45:16,791
Counsel for the defence
has the floor.

1050
01:45:19,002 --> 01:45:23,173
My learned colleague
who just spoke,

1051
01:45:24,175 --> 01:45:26,469
who is, if I'm not mistaken,

1052
01:45:26,595 --> 01:45:29,389
wanted by the police
on three counts of manslaughter...

1053
01:45:29,516 --> 01:45:31,767
That's irrelevant here.

1054
01:45:31,893 --> 01:45:36,982
has claimed that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively

1055
01:45:37,108 --> 01:45:39,025
warrants the death sentence.

1056
01:45:39,151 --> 01:45:41,320
That's right!

1057
01:45:41,446 --> 01:45:43,490
He is mistaken,

1058
01:45:43,615 --> 01:45:47,202
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!

1059
01:45:47,328 --> 01:45:49,329
Get outta here, will you?

1060
01:45:49,456 --> 01:45:50,957
Are you nuts, or plastered?

1061
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:53,002
It is precisely
the nature of compulsion

1062
01:45:53,128 --> 01:45:56,755
that relieves him
of responsibility for his actions!

1063
01:45:56,881 --> 01:46:02,429
And a man cannot be punished for that
for which he is not responsible!

1064
01:46:02,556 --> 01:46:06,977
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?

1065
01:46:07,103 --> 01:46:08,562
That he should live?

1066
01:46:08,688 --> 01:46:12,233
I'm saying that this man is sick,

1067
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:16,488
and you turn a sick man
over to a doctor, not an executioner.

1068
01:46:16,615 --> 01:46:20,744
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?

1069
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:24,581
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?

1070
01:46:24,707 --> 01:46:28,044
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?

1071
01:46:28,171 --> 01:46:29,880
Another month-long manhunt!

1072
01:46:30,006 --> 01:46:32,090
Once again the insanity clause,
once again the asylum!

1073
01:46:32,216 --> 01:46:36,137
Another breakout or possible release!
And again "must kill"!

1074
01:46:36,263 --> 01:46:39,015
Is this supposed
to go on indefinitely?

1075
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:41,269
No one has the right to kill a man

1076
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:46,734
who cannot be held
responsible for his crimes!

1077
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:51,573
Not even the state,
and all of you least of all!

1078
01:46:52,324 --> 01:46:57,537
The state must ensure
that this man is rendered harmless

1079
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:02,378
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society!

1080
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:08,134
You never had kids, did you?

1081
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:10,971
Then you never lost any either.

1082
01:47:12,265 --> 01:47:17,896
But if you wanna know what it's like
when a little child is taken from you,

1083
01:47:18,022 --> 01:47:21,985
just ask the parents
whose kids he took away!

1084
01:47:22,112 --> 01:47:26,907
Ask them about the days and nights
not knowing what had happened,

1085
01:47:27,785 --> 01:47:31,371
and later,
when they finally found out...

1086
01:47:32,165 --> 01:47:34,583
Why don't you ask the mothers?

1087
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:37,129
You should ask the mothers!

1088
01:47:37,255 --> 01:47:39,340
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them

1089
01:47:39,465 --> 01:47:41,467
for murdering their kids?

1090
01:47:41,593 --> 01:47:43,177
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!

1091
01:47:43,303 --> 01:47:45,514
No mercy for the killer!

1092
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,516
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!

1093
01:47:47,642 --> 01:47:50,519
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!

1094
01:47:50,645 --> 01:47:52,689
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!

1095
01:47:52,815 --> 01:47:54,733
- Kill him!
- Waste him!

1096
01:47:54,859 --> 01:47:58,697
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!

1097
01:47:59,657 --> 01:48:03,327
I will not let you shout me down!

1098
01:48:06,833 --> 01:48:13,547
I will not allow a murder
to be committed in my presence.

1099
01:48:13,673 --> 01:48:16,426
I demand that this human being...

1100
01:48:16,552 --> 01:48:17,928
That's not a human being!

1101
01:48:18,054 --> 01:48:21,557
that this human being be afforded
the same protection under the law

1102
01:48:21,683 --> 01:48:23,518
rendered the common criminal!

1103
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:24,728
Not a chance!

1104
01:48:24,854 --> 01:48:28,901
I demand that he
be handed over to the police!

1105
01:48:29,026 --> 01:48:32,195
The police!
Of all the dumb...

1106
01:48:59,229 --> 01:49:01,314
In the name of the law...

1107
01:49:25,095 --> 01:49:26,637
In the name of the people...

1108
01:49:26,763 --> 01:49:31,268
This will not bring
our children back.

1109
01:49:36,441 --> 01:49:41,363
One has to
keep closer watch

1110
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:45,451
over the children!

1111
01:49:47,121 --> 01:49:49,039
All of you!
