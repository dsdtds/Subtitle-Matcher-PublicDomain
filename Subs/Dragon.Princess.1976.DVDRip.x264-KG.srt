00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,210
NEW YORK 1966

3
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:42,163
BRUTAL CHANGE IN CITY CRIME!

4
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:47,701
VICTIMS FOLLOW AMONG THE POLICEMEN!

5
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,084
NYPD HAS TAKEN KARATE FOR
SELF PROTECTION!

6
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:00,623
OPPOSITION DEVELOPS OVER KARATE
TEACHER POST!

10
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:32,012
I repeat...

11
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:38,459
I strongly recommend Mr. Higaki Isshin
as the city's first Karate instructor.

12
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:45,265
Mr. Higaki was recognized at a young age as a
Karate genius by the Okinawan Karate society.

13
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:53,067
Also, he is well respected among the
Karate players in the U.S.

14
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,908
I understand.

15
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:02,378
Endorsed by you, a hero of the Japanese-American
soldiers of WWII, I have no objections.

16
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:09,954
But Mr. Nikaido has just opened
a flashy new Dojo in town.

17
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:15,991
He's a Fifth Degree Black Belt of the Tokyo
Gobukan School, and has connections at city hall.

18
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:22,829
Recently, they've been pressuring the
New York City Police Headquarters.

19
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:31,776
I want to settle it amicably.

20
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:37,186
Please wait for the final decision.

21
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:39,849
But...

22
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,406
Come on!

23
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,108
You ready to fight?

24
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,141
I didn't come here to fight.

25
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:39,847
What?

26
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,587
Because I don't have any
reason to want to fight you.

27
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:55,627
Well, you may have no reason,

28
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,966
but I've plenty of reasons.

29
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,434
I want that Karate instructor's
job, and you're in my way.

30
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:08,607
That's no reason! We're
both good Karate men.

31
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:12,274
They'll choose one of us.
Leave it at that.

32
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,807
That's all crap.

33
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:20,752
You gonna fight me, or is
your Karate just for show?

34
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,571
Get back.

35
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,180
Right.

36
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:13,576
Wait!

37
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:35,492
Nikaido, now listen.
Stop this foolishness.

38
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,490
Get lost!

39
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:08,959
You're a coward Nikaido!

40
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:18,868
Higaki!

41
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,736
Father!

42
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:24,638
Yumi!

43
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:39,786
Father.

44
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,387
Father!

45
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:05,536
Higaki, I'm willing to spare your life.

46
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:08,736
But you have to get out of this town.

47
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:10,741
Alright.

48
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:20,721
Father! Father!

49
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:49,784
Yumi, please pull it out.
Pull it out. Go on! Quickly!

50
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:12,339
Yumi. You remember them. Fix
those faces in your mind.

51
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,480
You hear me, and never
ever forget them.

"Karate is difficult."
"Karate is something I hate!"

84
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:58,019
Come on. Attack!

85
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:16,965
Come on you. Don't think of me.
Think of Nikaido.

86
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,843
Just think of me as Nikaido!

87
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:27,444
Come on.

88
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,100
Father.

89
00:17:27,844 --> 00:17:31,837
Yumi... Yumi.

90
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,278
Yes.

91
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:46,385
You had no real childhood,
practicing all the time.

92
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:55,601
Everyday Karate. Maybe you thought
I was pushing you too hard,

93
00:17:55,906 --> 00:18:00,309
just so you could eventually, one day...

94
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:06,447
But that's not really true,
it wasn't just for me.

95
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:20,559
You see, Okizaki too,
Nikaido killed him.

96
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:33,567
That's how he got the job
as Karate Instructor.

97
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:42,609
Okizaki was blocking him.
And now, he's back in Tokyo,

98
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:46,050
running the Gobukan, and
doing well they say.

99
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:57,428
He's got backing from politicians,

100
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:04,639
and right now he's lauding
it over the Karate world.

101
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:11,704
I'm alright, I'm alright. I'm ok.

102
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:22,917
That's the reason I taught you.
So you can get him.

103
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:34,261
Don't let him deface Karate.
Expose him for the killer he is.

104
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:55,921
I know I've been a poor father. Yumi... please
don't begrudge me... it'll only make you bitter.

105
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:06,260
And when I'm gone, I want
you to go back to your...

106
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:16,737
...grandfather in Tokyo. I'm
sure he'll help you.

107
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,445
He's a good man.

108
00:20:50,613 --> 00:21:06,485
Father, I swear I'll avenge you.
I'll get Nikaido. I promise on my life.

109
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:33,148
Father. Father! Father!

112
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,317
- Sir, can I have one?
- There you are.

113
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:41,751
Hey how's things?

114
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,123
Hey, your mother's looking for you.

115
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,923
Oh, alright.
How's that, huh?

116
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,560
Tastes good, thanks.

117
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:50,660
Thank you. Thank you.

118
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:53,129
Hey, watch it.

119
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:05,074
I believe that's mine.

120
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:11,947
Watch it, you scared me.
Wh... What is it?

121
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:13,353
Give it back!

122
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:17,892
Well, I just found it, so
it's mine. Alright!?

123
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,958
Damn it!

124
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,798
So you wanna fight, do you?

125
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:36,544
I'll show you.

126
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:44,143
This isn't a show.

127
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:48,057
Just shut up. Get out.

128
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:54,229
Now you come back here.

129
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:56,759
Wait!

130
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:05,397
Tell me, Ryusen-ji Temple, you know it?

131
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:09,411
Ryusen-ji? You're the monk's relative?

132
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,511
I'm sorry.

133
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:17,651
- Here.
- Thanks.

136
00:25:01,197 --> 00:25:02,630
Osu!

137
00:25:05,935 --> 00:25:07,869
Right, teacher.

138
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,339
First group.

139
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:17,635
Osu!

140
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:41,765
Osu!

141
00:25:43,473 --> 00:25:44,940
Second group.

142
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:54,276
Osu!

143
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:30,783
Enough.

144
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,922
- That's a draw, huh?
- No

145
00:26:38,394 --> 00:26:43,764
You got the first real blow in sir,
so you have beaten me there.

146
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:48,131
Well, and so what's your name?

147
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:53,064
Ah, I'm new. I'm Okiyama Masahiko.

148
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:56,338
Well, he's a good fighter.

149
00:26:57,714 --> 00:27:01,775
I think he's going to be too
much for you to handle soon.

150
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:05,219
Teacher, we're the big four here.

151
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:08,018
There's no way he's gonna
be a match for us?

152
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:26,673
What is it?

153
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,738
I'd like to see Sensei Nikaido.

154
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:35,979
- You're his relative?
- No.

155
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,915
- Are you here for a lesson?
- I'm not.

156
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:40,851
What do you want?

157
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:43,422
I would like to have a contest
with Sensei Nikaido.

158
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:44,958
Huh!?

159
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:47,660
You're crazy girl.

160
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,458
A contest? You're nuts.

161
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:52,625
Come on, you'll have to leave.
Go on, get lost.

162
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:58,805
Listen girl. Go on, this is no
place for a young woman to be.

163
00:27:58,841 --> 00:28:00,172
That's right.

164
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:06,015
If I can't fight Sensei Nikaido,
I'll take the big four, alright?

165
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:06,349
If I can't fight Sensei Nikaido,
I'll take the big four, alright?
What!?

166
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:07,407
What!?

167
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:10,027
They'll probably cripple you for life, kid.

168
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,354
I'm willing to take that risk. I'm not worried.

169
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:19,956
Now look, so you really wanna fight do you?

170
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,488
Well alright! You fight me then! Come on!

171
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,350
Come on!

172
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:42,140
Now, what's wrong? Come on.

173
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,019
Kuroe...

174
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,299
Don't do it.

175
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:50,827
We want no one hurt.

176
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,954
It's alright, huh, she just said
that she's all prepared to get hurt.

177
00:28:57,074 --> 00:29:00,043
Not her. It's you I meant.

178
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,635
What was that!? Alright, you're
trying to insult me are you, huh?

179
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,277
Well you wait, I'm going to
deal with you next.

180
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,038
Senpai!

181
00:29:38,374 --> 00:29:41,639
Damn! This time, for sure...

182
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,659
Wait.

183
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:11,904
Now just who the hell are you anyway?

184
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,438
Higaki Yumi.

185
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,380
Senpai!

186
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,483
Higaki?

187
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:35,024
Fools! I always said be careful.

188
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,930
Inukai!

189
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:41,794
Enough.

190
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,069
Just remember this.

191
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,435
Yes. I'm very sorry, sir.

192
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:51,645
Osu!

193
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:57,378
Okiyama. Tell me, this girl,
she give you her name?

194
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,951
Yeah, she did.

195
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,617
Higaki Yumi.

196
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:08,561
Does the name mean anything to you?

197
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:10,863
No... Nothing.

198
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:17,529
I see. Well, maybe she's just a nutcase.

199
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,971
But she could fight reasonably well.

200
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,307
Oh, so you think that you could
beat her easily, is that right?

201
00:31:26,349 --> 00:31:30,683
Well, of course I'd beat her.
She's just a girl.

202
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:33,087
Well, why did you let her go then?

203
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:35,817
At least you could've thought the bitch a
nice hard lesson, couldn't you?

204
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:36,984
Come on.

205
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:40,156
You seriously suggesting a
man should fight a girl?

206
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:41,826
Osu!

207
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,733
- Damn you!
- Hold it! Enough!

208
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,168
There'll be plenty of time.
He'll get his comeuppance.

209
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,442
- Yokoi.
- Yes?

210
00:31:57,913 --> 00:31:59,608
Osu!

211
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:09,848
Teacher. Higaki?

212
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:13,786
She's his daughter?

213
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:39,082
I heard that Isshin died recently in
some broken down slum in Los Angeles.

214
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:43,025
I guess he must've trained his
daughter in Karate to avenge him.

215
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:47,988
That stupid fool. How in the
hell could she beat you?

216
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:56,028
Priest!

217
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:59,502
Kotaro, are you working hard?

218
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:03,768
Yeah, all the time. I live humbly
and I'm always short of money.

219
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,904
Don't lie.

220
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:09,213
Your mother was complaining.

221
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:12,345
She says you haven't been home recently.

222
00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:14,688
Hey!

223
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:17,553
One mother, one child.

224
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:21,087
Stop worrying your old mother.

225
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:22,895
Okay.

226
00:33:27,136 --> 00:33:30,003
- What's so funny?
- No, it's nothing.

227
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:33,723
Hey, priest. Today, I've brought
you an unusual visitor.

228
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:37,987
Instead of scolding me, maybe
you'll appreciate me for once.

229
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:40,356
- Mh?
- Never mind.

230
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:44,658
Hey, this way! Over here.

231
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:47,079
The "Preacher Man" is waiting for you.

232
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,048
- What do you mean by "Preacher Man" ?
- Thanks. I'm leaving.

233
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,540
Yumi?

234
00:34:41,972 --> 00:34:49,208
You're so grown up. The living
image of your mother.

235
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,358
And how's your father?

236
00:35:23,649 --> 00:35:28,109
Come with me. We'll go
to your mother's grave.

237
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:37,149
Your dear father's ashes should
be laid to rest with her. Right?

238
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:54,374
Your father was such a fool, he
just wouldn't listen. Nope.

239
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:01,952
He told me America was the best
place for a career in Karate,

240
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:05,760
and insisted on taking you with him.

241
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:13,934
Your mother had just died, and you
were still practically a baby.

242
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:17,666
I argued and argued with your father,
but he wouldn't listen to me...

243
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,334
...and he wouldn't change his mind.

244
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:26,080
He was such a fool really.

245
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,940
Oh, Yumi.

246
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:35,790
There'll be time for you girls later.

247
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:40,353
This won't take long sir, I promise.

248
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:46,886
Well, so it's Karate again, some
new championship?

249
00:36:47,136 --> 00:36:51,266
Ah, it's to celebrate the 30th
anniversary of my Gobukan school.

250
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:54,936
Hmm, a bit weak. You may
not get much support.

251
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:59,437
No. This contest will be a
real international affair.

252
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:03,581
You see, we'll encourage entrants from
all of the major world schools,

253
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,020
but I'm quite confident that
the pupils from my school...

254
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:08,956
...will emerge the final winners.

255
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:13,923
After that, I hope that we can set up a
big financial foundation for my school.

256
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:20,629
I realize that my school
wasn't founded very long ago,

257
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:25,639
but in terms of the quality of my pupils,
we're way ahead of most of the schools.

258
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:29,241
So then, if we could manage to
win this championship,

259
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:32,439
then all of the good pupils
would flock to the school.

260
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:36,877
And I can imagine that
what you have in mind,

261
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:40,317
is to use my political status to
get the thing off the ground.

262
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:44,926
Yes. After all there could be
some advantages for you.

263
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,655
At a conservative estimate, half a million young
men will enroll in Karate schools this year.

264
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:55,100
- That's a lot of votes isn't it?
- Indeed

265
00:37:56,538 --> 00:38:02,033
Another point. Entry fees will be quite high.
There's going to be an awful lot of money in this,

266
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:06,514
plenty for everybody, and some of
that can go to your party funds.

267
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:11,416
All in all, it could be a very nice deal.

268
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:16,213
I must admit it sounds like
an attractive proposition.

269
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,327
Alright, count me in.

270
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,267
You can use my name, but I warn you though,

271
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:35,142
your school had better win this. And win
in a big way, or it's all a waste of time.

272
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:42,141
You can rely on us. We have plenty of
good men, including the big four here.

273
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:48,621
That's good to hear. Well, let's celebrate
then in anticipation of victory.

274
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,693
- Here.
- Sir!

275
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:55,789
We're very grateful to you, sir.

276
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,059
Just you win it. Remember that.

277
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:02,129
Yes, sir!

278
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:30,750
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

279
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:35,122
Now, come on folks. Buy yourself a magazine.

280
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:40,897
Just take a look at what I've got. It
doesn't cost you anything to look at them,

281
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:44,802
and maybe you'll see something
you really fancy.

282
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:47,771
Real artistic pictures. We've got
some beautiful full frontals,

283
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,641
all the latest issues, best selection in
town. And some nice hot group stuff as well.

284
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,446
Take your breath away. Come on have a
look here folks, very reasonable.

285
00:40:55,484 --> 00:40:59,011
- Alright, I'll have one.
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

286
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:00,939
- Hey mother.
- Yeah?

287
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,474
- I just made a sale.
- Good for you.

288
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:07,840
Come on, quick, have a look here.
Sexy magazines, straight from America.

289
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:11,025
Alright, let's do this.

290
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:20,869
Hey, listen to me. The boys have got money
problems. It's all this inflation you see.

291
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:25,308
So we're going to have to put up
the dues. We need 50% more.

292
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:28,545
What? That's outrageous.

293
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:31,382
But how can we pay that much?

294
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:36,422
Now please sir, are you gonna try
to starve us to death or something?

295
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:38,186
If you don't like it, go somewhere else.

296
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,456
Ma'am! Are you alright? Are you alright?

297
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:46,728
- Damn you.
- Bastard, come on.

298
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:52,065
Damn you.

299
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:55,199
- Well, go help her.
- But they're yakuza...

300
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:58,212
And so what, you're just gonna stand
by and let them get away with this?

301
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,737
- What could I do?
- Lousy coward!

302
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,414
Are you gonna pay?

303
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,166
Come with me. Please, please help.

304
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:27,135
Look. Please help.

305
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:28,837
Please help us.

306
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:32,642
Now, have the money ready
tomorrow. You got that?

307
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:34,681
You can go to hell!

308
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:39,145
I'm not gonna pay you anything.
You lousy bunch of hoodlums!

309
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:43,021
- What? Are you crazy?
- Damn you. I'm not paying, no.

310
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:46,586
Get that scum.

311
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:49,763
I'm not paying you.
You heard me.

312
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:53,226
What the hell is this, huh?

313
00:43:02,377 --> 00:43:04,538
Damn you!

314
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:14,483
Wow, you're tough.
You got 'em all!

315
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:27,831
- Senpai, are you serious?
- Yes.

316
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,468
I'll do my best.

317
00:43:29,504 --> 00:43:34,942
- I'll give it a try.
- I won't be beaten!

318
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:53,610
Bitch!

319
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:57,647
- Teacher, it's me Yokoi.
- Right.

320
00:46:01,022 --> 00:46:03,013
Here's the list of all the entrants.

321
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:04,523
Oh, thank you.

322
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:05,951
Osu!

323
00:46:12,634 --> 00:46:15,398
HIGAKI Yumi

324
00:46:23,778 --> 00:46:25,507
CHINEN Jiro

325
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:27,738
Teacher, what's wrong?

326
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:30,851
Chinen from Okinawa.

327
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:33,648
Gonzales from Cuba.

328
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:36,122
Suuccine from Libya.

329
00:46:58,313 --> 00:47:01,908
LIBYA

330
00:47:13,194 --> 00:47:16,459
CUBA

331
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:37,479
NAHA, OKINAWA

332
00:49:20,955 --> 00:49:21,944
Wait!

333
00:49:49,784 --> 00:49:50,682
Dear!

334
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:51,986
Stay back!

335
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:42,729
Dear!

336
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,642
Dear!

337
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:55,545
You bastards...

338
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:19,300
Well now, I guess you've nothing
else for us? That job's finished.

339
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,075
Now hang on... some other
tough entrants might show up.

340
00:51:23,578 --> 00:51:28,811
Well I guess so. As a matter of fact, I
saw a really tough guy a few minutes ago.

341
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:30,177
You mean Yokoi?

342
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:34,013
No... I know all the big four.

343
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:36,820
The guy he was practicing with.

344
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:39,491
Oh... that's Okiyama.

345
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:41,685
Okiyama, so that's his name?

346
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:46,625
Well I know one thing he's one
of the best Karate men I've seen.

347
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:51,834
In fact, I'm gonna have to try
him out one of these days.

348
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:56,033
The international men are dead,

349
00:51:56,277 --> 00:51:59,246
now we're gonna win the
championship for sure.

350
00:51:59,447 --> 00:52:02,143
It's as good as in our pockets.

351
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:31,038
What!? He wants me to
cripple the young girl?

352
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:33,980
Yes... you'll be well paid for it.

353
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:41,377
The boss doesn't want her in circulation.
It'll be easy... and profitable.

354
00:52:41,623 --> 00:52:44,183
Come on, think of the money!

355
00:52:45,326 --> 00:52:49,490
Senpai, I need money!
Why not let me try.

356
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:51,757
Oh... a greedy one, eh?

357
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:55,291
Okiyama, now look, are you trying
to cut us out of this, huh?

358
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:58,768
Fifty fifty, split it down the middle.

359
00:52:59,073 --> 00:53:03,942
Oh, cool it. Hey, let's get on
with the party huh?

360
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,177
All right girls, before I
go I'll finish this beer.

361
00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:33,463
How are you?

362
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:36,807
Out of my way.

363
00:56:16,404 --> 00:56:20,704
I never imagined any girl
could be so good at Karate.

364
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:24,207
Just a few days to
go... what will we do?

365
00:56:24,712 --> 00:56:25,770
Think of something.

366
00:56:26,047 --> 00:56:30,643
If we lose in public to a woman, then
the school will be finished for good.

367
00:56:30,885 --> 00:56:32,546
There's only one thing to do.

368
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:36,852
Teacher, leave her to us. The big
four will handle her.

369
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:42,791
No, you four will stick to your practicing.
I want you to do nothing else.

370
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:50,133
You useless bigmouth, you!

371
00:56:53,174 --> 00:56:54,664
Now stop it!

372
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:35,839
Grandfather!

373
00:57:53,701 --> 00:57:54,759
Who are you?

374
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:16,920
Grandfather, get back... they're
Nikaido's men. They killed my father.

375
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,934
Hold it!

376
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:33,896
Hold it there.

377
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:36,774
Ten years ago...

378
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:46,081
My father Robert Okizaki of the NYPD
tried to stop Nikaido's appointment...

379
00:58:47,888 --> 00:58:50,118
...and you three bastards killed him.

380
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,562
Here's the evidence right here...

381
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:07,870
This dagger... It's just like the one
the police found in his body.

382
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:19,244
I see. You deliberately lost to
her to force us out.

383
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:21,485
That's right.

384
00:59:22,923 --> 00:59:25,153
And it was you that killed Chinen too.

385
00:59:26,594 --> 00:59:28,994
Nikaido will pay.

386
00:59:38,572 --> 00:59:40,233
I'll take him.

387
00:59:43,277 --> 00:59:47,646
Ten years I've worked, practicing
just for this day.

388
01:01:38,993 --> 01:01:40,017
Yumi.

389
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:47,498
Yumi...

390
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,988
Grandfather!

391
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:11,679
- Grandfather.
- Yumi...

392
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:38,737
Fighting with that arm again
is out of the question.

393
01:03:39,313 --> 01:03:44,148
It was difficult to set.
That's a really bad fracture.

394
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:53,750
I warn you. You fight with that, and you'll
permanently disable it. You understand?

395
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:59,864
Listen. Wait until your arm is better.
Understand? You wouldn't have a chance, right?

396
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:02,926
Right. And you might get killed.

397
01:04:04,705 --> 01:04:08,334
Maybe, but I'm resigned to that possibility.

398
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:14,212
Tomorrow is the only chance to
get Nikaido, the last chance.

399
01:04:16,016 --> 01:04:22,285
He must lose, or there'll be no way
of stopping him later on. I know it.

400
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:34,131
Listen, if anything should happen to me, take
care of Grandfather. He's gonna need help.

401
01:04:43,744 --> 01:04:45,678
Your grandfather's calling for you.

402
01:04:56,256 --> 01:04:57,188
Yumi...

403
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:07,760
So then... you intend to
commit suicide, do you, eh?

404
01:05:11,872 --> 01:05:12,896
You fool!

405
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:18,474
You must win.

406
01:05:26,387 --> 01:05:35,921
You've never lived, you know that. Those
years, living in the dark shadow of your father...

407
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:46,363
And your life will only really
begin... when Nikaido's been killed.

408
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:54,871
So you mustn't die now. You have
to beat him by any means.

409
01:05:59,086 --> 01:06:07,118
Fair or foul. Never mind
about rules, just get him.

410
01:06:11,365 --> 01:06:15,825
Kill him... but stay alive

411
01:06:28,315 --> 01:06:34,982
"Just remember. It doesn't always
take strength to accomplish things."

412
01:06:36,156 --> 01:06:43,528
"Quite often, a weak tool,
will achieve what you want."

413
01:06:44,965 --> 01:06:50,904
"So let your weakness serve
you as the weapon you'll use."

414
01:06:51,538 --> 01:06:58,467
"And it can help you, because, your
enemy will count on that weakness,"

415
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:03,112
"and let himself be out-maneuvered."

416
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:08,787
"Then you strike. Then you'll
have a chance to win."

417
01:08:53,527 --> 01:08:55,495
"Letter of challenge."

418
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:01,157
"To the director of the Gobukan
School, Nikaido Kosen."

419
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:07,540
"We challenge you to a duel to the
death on the Suzuki Hara slopes."

420
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:14,077
"We shall be there at dawn.
Higaki Yumi, Okizaki Masahiko."

421
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:21,815
The girl's only got one arm, it's
the man's that's the problem.

422
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:27,619
Inukai... you and Yokoi, you
can deal with him first.

423
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:34,424
Make sure they're both killed.
I want no further trouble.

424
01:09:34,568 --> 01:09:38,504
And after it's finished, we'll
go to the stadium for the contest.

425
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:40,333
OSU!

426
01:10:10,604 --> 01:10:11,935
- Over here...
- Right.

427
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:54,944
There he is... come on, get him!

428
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:04,318
Hey, there he is.

429
01:11:10,063 --> 01:11:11,690
All right... go. Go!

430
01:12:00,046 --> 01:12:02,105
Osu! The girl's not there.

431
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:03,542
What?

432
01:12:04,384 --> 01:12:05,715
Go and search the slope.

433
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:07,011
Osu!

434
01:12:08,422 --> 01:12:09,912
Hey, let's search the whole slope.

435
01:12:09,923 --> 01:12:10,651
Osu!

436
01:12:35,415 --> 01:12:37,975
There she is! She's there!

437
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:48,863
Isshin

438
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,704
You really think you can
beat me one-handed?

439
01:20:53,013 --> 01:20:56,073
THE END

440
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:58,684
Thanks to Bill and Kentaifilms
for translating a few scenes.
