1
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,044
Bring out Elizabeth Selwyn.

2
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,352
Bring out the witch!
Bring out the witch!

3
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,268
Bring her out! Bring her out!

4
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,118
Witch!

5
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,120
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

6
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,052
Burn the witch!

7
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:41,309
Jeth row! Jeth row!

8
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,562
Jeth row!

9
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:51,062
Jethrow Keane, hast thou consorted
with the witch, Elizabeth Selwyn?

10
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,742
No.

11
00:02:58,401 --> 00:02:59,744
Burn the witch!

12
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,168
No! No!

13
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:18,759
Please!

14
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:21,766
No!

15
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:37,323
No! No! No! No! No!

16
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:45,031
Help her, O Lucifer, help her.

17
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:47,250
Elizabeth Selwyn...

18
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:50,586
on this third day of March,

19
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:53,922
in the year of our Lord, 1692...

20
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,378
we, the people of Whitewood,
Massachusetts,

21
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:00,379
condemn thee as a witch.

22
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:07,432
May the flames
cleanse thy soul of its evil.

23
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:09,855
Of its lust for blood

24
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:13,727
that made thee bring about the death
of Abigail Adams.

25
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:34,167
Help her, Lucifer, help her!

26
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:50,852
I have made my pact with thee,
O Lucifer. Hear me!

27
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:53,061
Hear me!

28
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,901
I will do thy bidding for all eternity.

29
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:58,988
For all eternity shall I practise
the ritual of Black Mass.

30
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:02,450
- Lucifer.
- For eternity shall I sacrifice unto thee.

31
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:08,039
I can feel my soul
taking me to thy service.

32
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:11,034
O Lucifer, listen to thy servant.

33
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:15,038
Grant her this pact for all eternity,
and I with her,

34
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:20,259
and if we fail thee but once,
you may do with our souls what you will.

35
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:24,222
Make this city an example
of thy vengeance.

36
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,175
Curse it.

37
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:30,178
- Curse it for all eternity.
- Curse?

38
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:33,226
And let me be
the instrument of thy curse.

39
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,725
Hear me, O Lucifer.

40
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,318
Hear me!

41
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:39,479
She's making a curse.

42
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:41,480
Curse?

43
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,691
Burn her! Burn her!

44
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:45,784
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

45
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:49,622
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

46
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,334
Burn! Burn her!

47
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,044
Burn the witch!

48
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:58,290
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

49
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:01,213
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

50
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,466
Burn the witch!

51
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:09,593
Burn the witch!
Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

52
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:13,642
"Burn, witch! Burn, witch!
Burn, burn, burn!"

53
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:22,193
So shouted the people of Whitewood when
they burnt Elizabeth Selwyn in 1692.

54
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:25,192
Little is known today
of the actual practices of witchcraft

55
00:06:25,316 --> 00:06:26,693
in 17th century New England.

56
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:31,239
Superstition, fear and jealousy
drove the puritans

57
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:34,617
to accuse their friends and relatives
of consorting with the Devil.

58
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:38,291
Parading around huge bonfires,
repeating vindictive chants,

59
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,790
they consigned the poor creatures
to the flames.

60
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:44,795
Their tortured souls cried out in agony
as the flames mounted higher and higher.

61
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,719
"Burn, witch! Burn, witch! Burn, burn!"

62
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,432
- Dig that crazy beat.
- Shh!

63
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:56,431
That will be all for today.

64
00:06:57,306 --> 00:07:01,356
Tomorrow will be my concluding lecture on
witchcraft in 17th century New England.

65
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:05,027
I shall bring along some illustrations,
which I'm sure will interest you all.

66
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,321
I'll bring the matches.

67
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:09,785
Maitland!

68
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:13,160
Since you chose
to attend these lectures,

69
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,330
I had hope that it was in the spirit of
scientific curiosity about the subject.

70
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,297
That'll be all.

71
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:27,128
- How could you?
- He takes it all so darn serious.

72
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,005
He's got you all hypnotised!

73
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:31,883
- Oh, Miss Barlow?
- Yes, Professor?

74
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,600
- Can I see you for a moment?
- Yes.

75
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:35,139
What about our date?

76
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:37,517
- Look, urn...
- I'll meet you.

77
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,231
I'll wait for you outside.

78
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,731
Yes, Professor.

79
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,114
Rather a difficult young man, that.

80
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,827
You're more than an attraction
to him than my poor efforts.

81
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:54,447
I've been reading
through your papers, Miss Barlow.

82
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,075
They show a very sound appreciation
of the subject.

83
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,452
I want to go to New England
to do my senior paper.

84
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,875
Mm-hm. They're really quite good,
you know.

85
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,624
Well, I'm not quite satisfied
with them yet.

86
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,844
I feel like I need
some first-hand research.

87
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,508
I wanna get the atmosphere.

88
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:13,007
Find out how widespread
witchcraft really was,

89
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:14,600
what the witches were really like.

90
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,100
- That might take a little time.
- Well, I have the time.

91
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,269
My brother and I were gonna spend
our vacation with our cousins.

92
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,063
What I'd really like to do

93
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:27,906
is to get a room in the smallest,
oldest town in New England I can find.

94
00:08:28,022 --> 00:08:29,990
Check through all the town hall records.

95
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:31,734
Recheck the libraries.

96
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,736
Talk to the puritan descendants.

97
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,863
Make a really thorough investigation.

98
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,287
Your brother is a Professor of science.

99
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:41,957
I hardly think
he'd be interested in witchcraft.

100
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:43,420
Then I go alone.

101
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,961
You don't think he'd object to that?

102
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:49,085
You leave Richard to me.
He's picking me up here for lunch.

103
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,137
Hello, Bill.

104
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:55,098
- Professor Barlow.
- Nan here?

105
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:59,228
She's in there with him.

106
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:02,064
I don't like her getting mixed up
in this witchcraft business.

107
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:05,105
Why not?
It's only part of her history course.

108
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,899
- Professor Barlow?
- Yes?

109
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:10,152
Before you go in there,
could I have a word with you?

110
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:12,400
- Yes, sure.
- Well, it's about Nan and me.

111
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:13,867
Oh.

112
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:17,614
If you're really serious about this, I
happen to know the town in New England.

113
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:22,084
It's the identical place where the events
occurred that I mentioned today, Whitewood.

114
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,209
It's quite a small place.
It's a little bit off the beaten track.

115
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,174
- So maybe these directions will help you.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:34,381
I think you might very well find
what you're looking for there.

117
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,599
I happen to know the woman
who owns the inn at Whitewood.

118
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,513
Her name is Mrs Newless.

119
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,136
So you just tell her I sent you.

120
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:43,139
Raven's Inn, Whitewood.

121
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:45,187
What's Whitewood?

122
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:48,356
Now, Dick, don't be too upset,

123
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:52,402
but I'm gonna change my plans
for the vacation.

124
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:55,072
- Change of plans?
- Yes.

125
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:58,696
I'm going to a place called Whitewood
for a week or so to do some research.

126
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:00,915
Oh, are you?
And what about cousin Sue?

127
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:04,285
She's expecting you
for her birthday party on the 17th.

128
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:04,911
She'll never forgive you.

129
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:08,255
I can still easily make it by then.
This is important.

130
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:11,501
My term paper's got to be good.
It could mean a scholarship.

131
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,346
- I've made all the arrangements.
- Dick, you'll have a good time without me.

132
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,508
My mind's made up.
I'm going to Whitewood.

133
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:22,603
But surely any good encyclopaedia will
give you all the nonsense you wanna know.

134
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,645
Witchcraft is not nonsense, Barlow.

135
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:28,142
I'm sorry, Driscoll.

136
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:33,990
Witchcraft, black magic, sorcery, to me
it's nothing but fairy-tale mumbo-jumbo.

137
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:36,825
I'm a scientist, Driscoll.
I believe what I can see,

138
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,114
what I can feel and touch.

139
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:42,741
"The basis of fairy tales is reality.
The basis of reality is fairy tales."

140
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:46,244
As a scientist, you should be familiar
with that quotation.

141
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:49,372
I don't believe somebody in Chicago
can die of a heart attack,

142
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:52,340
because some woman in New Orleans
sticks a pin in a wax doll!

143
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:56,304
Maybe you don't, but practitioners
of voodoo claim otherwise.

144
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,424
- Dick, you're just being difficult.
- No.

145
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:03,428
When I look into a microscope, I see the
bacteria, swimming, fighting, existing.

146
00:11:03,552 --> 00:11:08,058
That's real! These witches, they were
persecuted and burned in the 17th century.

147
00:11:08,182 --> 00:11:10,651
Were real too, but they weren't witches.

148
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:13,988
They were pitiful human beings.
Victims of hysteria.

149
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:17,028
There are many eminent scholars
who have documentary proof

150
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,992
of the actual practice of witchcraft.

151
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:21,157
Yes,
but how effective was this practice?

152
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,532
Did any of these eminent scholars
ever meet a real practising witch?

153
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,454
Did you ever meet a witch, Driscoll?

154
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,247
Perhaps.

155
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,625
Oh, come on. You're a historian.

156
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:37,595
No witch ever survived a burning at the
stake for all their pacts with the Devil.

157
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,383
In 1692 Elizabeth Selwyn
went to the stake.

158
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:46,437
She was buried in a churchyard
in New England.

159
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:49,231
- And yet three years later...
- Yes.

160
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:53,069
And yet three years later a new wave of
blood sacrifices broke out in the village

161
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,528
that condemned her.

162
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:57,990
The daughters of the elders who had
condemned her were found murdered

163
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,860
with every last drop of blood
drained from their bodies,

164
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:04,909
and afterwards people came forward to
testify they had seen Elizabeth Selwyn.

165
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,877
Stop! This'd be more effective at midnight
with howling winds and crashing thunder.

166
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:12,587
And even then it
wouldn't frighten anyone.

167
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:13,705
Dick!

168
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,458
I'm sorry Professor Driscoll.

169
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:19,219
It's all right, Miss Barlow.

170
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:23,091
You won't be the first person
to have scoffed at the subject.

171
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,511
Honey, when you get to,
urn, where is it?

172
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,808
- Whitewood.
- Ah, yes, Whitewood.

173
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:31,148
Well, send me a picture postcard
of the witch.

174
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:33,233
If possible, autographed.

175
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,227
Now, uh, let's have some lunch, eh?

176
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:37,070
I'm sorry, I have a date.

177
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:55,623
Nan, darling, I still don't see why you
have to go up to this Whitewood place.

178
00:12:55,747 --> 00:13:00,002
Huh? I thought we were gonna have
some time together during this vacation.

179
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:02,846
You know I wanna be with you.
It's just this is important.

180
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:06,763
Look, what the heck can you find
that hasn't been found before?

181
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,141
I don't know.

182
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:12,936
It's just that maybe, hidden in some
attic or buried in some old antique shop,

183
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:16,185
there's something that might give
a new outlook on the subject.

184
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,153
Oh, what new outlook can there be?

185
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:21,900
You're a science student.
You know how important research is.

186
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:24,277
But this isn't about anything real.

187
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,780
This is just superstitious people
burning silly old women.

188
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,158
But suppose the women weren't silly.

189
00:13:30,282 --> 00:13:32,660
Suppose they really had a pact
with the Devil.

190
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,583
A pact that could have
supernatural power.

191
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:38,131
Oh, come on. What kind of power?

192
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:40,129
I don't know.

193
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,346
Oh, look, it's no use, Bill.

194
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,095
We've both tried our hardest
to talk her out of going.

195
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,440
Do you think
she will find anything worthwhile?

196
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:58,401
I think we have to respect her desire
to find something new,

197
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,113
even if we don't agree with the subject.

198
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,573
Agree with it?

199
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:06,569
I've never heard so much nonsense as
that guy Driscoll talks in all my life.

200
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,536
Well, here I am, all packed.

201
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:11,703
Oh. I suppose nothing I can say
will stop you from going, huh?

202
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,453
Yeah, well, I'll, uh,
I'll put this in the car.

203
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,043
I still hoped you'd
change your mind, Nan.

204
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:26,798
Don't worry, darling. I'll be back
as quick as I can, and I'll write.

205
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,765
Well, don't forget me altogether, huh?

206
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:36,816
I won't. Give Sue my love, and don't
forget we have a date at our party.

207
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,311
Bye, darling.

208
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,295
Uh, excuse me.
Can you help me? I seem to be lost.

209
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,763
Sure, if I can.

210
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,302
- I'm looking for the Wamport Road.
- Wamport Road?

211
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:12,472
Hardly anyone uses that any more.

212
00:15:12,593 --> 00:15:14,436
Well, my friend gave me the directions.

213
00:15:14,553 --> 00:15:18,274
Uh, "take road 28A,
turn onto the Wamport Road,

214
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,563
"bear left at the fork
through to Whitewood."

215
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:22,686
- Whitewood?
- Am I that far away?

216
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:24,609
No, ma'am. Not far.

217
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,451
Not many God-fearing folks visit
Whitewood nowadays. If I were you, I...

218
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,320
If, if you'll excuse me.
I'm in a hurry. Which way is it?

219
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:34,790
Well, follow this road
about two miles, you come to a fork.

220
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:36,829
There'll be a sign: Wamport Road.

221
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,952
Turn left, keep straight,
there'll be Whitewood.

222
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:40,420
Thank you very much.

223
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,416
Does that sign say "Wamport Road"?

224
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:20,411
Wamport Road? Yes.

225
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,287
Oh, good. I was afraid I missed it.

226
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:26,337
- Is it Whitewood you seek?
- Yes.

227
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,802
I, too. Uh, would I be imposing if...?

228
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,637
No, of course not. Get in.

229
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,097
Thank you.

230
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:44,477
You'd think the Highway Commission
would do something about these roads.

231
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,319
Watch out. Here comes another bump.

232
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:52,155
What is your mission in Whitewood?

233
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:57,574
Mission? Well, I'm going there
to do some research on witchcraft.

234
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:01,744
Professor Driscoll gave us very
interesting lectures on the subject.

235
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:04,792
I'm going there
to get some original source material.

236
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:09,085
- Do you know Whitewood?
- I've known it for many years.

237
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,632
- Do you go there often?
- Fairly often.

238
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:13,721
Oh, then you must know the Raven's Inn.

239
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,843
- I shall be resting there.
- Oh, so shall l.

240
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,804
Oh, my name's Nan Barlow.

241
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:21,646
My name's Jethrow Keane.

242
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:24,437
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

243
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,657
It's just like a picture
out of a history book.

244
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:44,461
I feel as though I were
in the 17th century.

245
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:47,873
Why hasn't Whitewood been written about?

246
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,922
It's off the beaten path.
Few tourists come here.

247
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:54,926
For Whitewood time stands still.

248
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,725
Look at that church.
Must have been beautiful.

249
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,104
What a shame
they let it get so run down.

250
00:18:04,347 --> 00:18:07,476
- Straight on?
- Yes, follow the road around.

251
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:22,241
Ah, there it is.
What a lovely old building.

252
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,826
17th century at least.

253
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,712
How picturesque can you get?

254
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,957
Right by the graveyard.

255
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:33,460
Yes. It has not been used
for more than 200 years.

256
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:36,589
- Any witches buried there?
- There are, indeed.

257
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:40,013
All in a section of
unconsecrated ground.

258
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,555
Spooky, isn't it?

259
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:46,522
Well, keep your fingers
crossed for me, Mr Keane.

260
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,642
I hope Mrs Newless has that room.

261
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:04,051
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Are you Mrs Newless?

262
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:08,225
- No.
- Oh, I'm Nan Barlow.

263
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:09,893
I was told I might find a room here.

264
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,940
I was recommended by a friend,
Professor Driscoll.

265
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:16,108
Perhaps you know him.

266
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:18,152
That will be all, Lottie.

267
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,785
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

268
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:28,375
Unfortunately, Lottie cannot talk.

269
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:30,619
I've often told her
not to answer the bell.

270
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,838
Poor thing.
Then you're Mrs Newless.

271
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,547
I am. May I help you?

272
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:37,008
Yes, I'd like to have a room here
for two weeks.

273
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:39,594
The hotel is quite full.

274
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:44,433
Oh, the guests are never about
at this time of day.

275
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,768
Well,
I'm a student of Professor Drisc0ll's.

276
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:49,479
He told me if I mentioned his name,
I'd have no trouble.

277
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,692
Well, there is a room
I could let you have.

278
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:56,231
It's just off the lobby.

279
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,026
Oh, thank you.

280
00:20:58,146 --> 00:21:01,446
Oh, Mrs Newless, that plaque.

281
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:05,738
Is it true that Elizabeth Selwyn
was really burnt here for being a witch?

282
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,870
She was.

283
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,583
And do you believe she was a witch?

284
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:15,414
Come along.
I'll show you to your room.

285
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,594
I hope you will be comfortable.

286
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,514
Yes, it is a nice room.

287
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,812
The previous occupants
have always found it most agreeable.

288
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:39,029
Well, if there's anything you should need,
just ring the bell for me at the desk.

289
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,488
Thank you.

290
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,385
Oh!

291
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:25,032
It's been so many months.

292
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,529
I have counted the
days till this holiday.

293
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,496
So have the others.

294
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:33,492
It wasn't easy
for some of my guests to get here.

295
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:35,618
Many had to travel vast distances.

296
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:37,087
I was lucky.

297
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:39,046
The last few miles were enchanting.

298
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,967
Miss Barlow is very good company.

299
00:22:43,084 --> 00:22:46,088
You must be tired, Jethrow.
Your room is ready.

300
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:48,806
And the festivities?

301
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:52,685
I am prepared.

302
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:00,519
Oh, Mrs Newless.

303
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:02,611
I thought I'd have a short look
around town.

304
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:03,696
I won't be gone long.

305
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,567
I think you'll find
the church interesting.

306
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:09,069
Unfortunately,
it no longer has a congregation.

307
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,916
He will be pleased.

308
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,807
I'm told this was once
a house of worship.

309
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,811
It is still a house of worship.

310
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:26,108
I am the reverend of this church.

311
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:29,073
As long as the breath
of life is within me,

312
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:32,069
this house shall remain God's house.

313
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,162
Must have been a beautiful building.

314
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:38,663
For me, it is still beautiful.

315
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:43,915
I'm sorry. What a shame that people
have let it fall into such a state.

316
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:48,589
Strangers rarely come to Whitewood.
Who are you?

317
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:51,588
I'm Nan Barlow.
I'm staying at the Raven's Inn.

318
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:54,011
Why have you come to Whitewood?

319
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:57,844
Well,
because I'm interested in witchcraft.

320
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,438
Young woman, leave Whitewood.

321
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:03,058
Leave Whitewood tonight.

322
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,231
For 300 years the Devil
has harboured over this city,

323
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:10,027
made it his own.

324
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:11,866
The people in it are his.

325
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:16,196
Evil has triumphed over good here.

326
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,158
Look at my church.

327
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:23,128
I have no parish.
No one worships here.

328
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:24,962
His is the power.

329
00:25:25,705 --> 00:25:28,458
- What power?
- Leave Whitewood.

330
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:32,967
Leave Whitewood tonight.
I beg of you!

331
00:25:33,087 --> 00:25:38,014
- What power?
- Leave before it is too late!

332
00:26:29,018 --> 00:26:30,861
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

333
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:33,528
Please excuse the mess.
We haven't been open long.

334
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:37,653
- You have some very interesting things here.
- Yes, they belong to my grandmother.

335
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:39,950
When she died,
I came back to sort things out.

336
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:42,574
Oh, I'm sorry.
Then you don't live here?

337
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,246
No. My family have lived here
for generations,

338
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,335
but I've been back a few weeks.

339
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:49,001
- Would you like to have a look around?
- Thank you.

340
00:26:49,622 --> 00:26:52,341
I didn't mean to frighten you
when I came in.

341
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,631
It's just that all the
people I've met here

342
00:26:54,752 --> 00:26:58,006
have acted like I'm a person
from another world.

343
00:26:58,131 --> 00:27:00,304
They don't see many strangers here.

344
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:04,396
And I had the most, well,
unusual experience with the reverend.

345
00:27:04,512 --> 00:27:06,355
He barred my way from the church.

346
00:27:07,056 --> 00:27:09,354
And he talked to me about a curse.

347
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:11,227
And he warned me to leave Whitewood.

348
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:13,313
Can you explain that?

349
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,482
No, I can't.

350
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:17,199
Does he often act that way?

351
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,657
- He's my grandfather.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

352
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:23,531
Oh, it's all right.
It's happened before with strangers.

353
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:25,909
The lack of parishioners,
the loss of his sight

354
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:28,787
has made him bitter and suspicious.

355
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:32,211
I'm afraid what with him and the town,
I was very scared.

356
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:34,426
When I saw your lights
I made a dash for them.

357
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:35,885
I'm glad you did.

358
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,885
Do you have any books
or pamphlets on witchcraft?

359
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:45,054
- You do, don't you? A friend of mine...
- We have a collection gathering dust.

360
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:47,601
But why on earth
would you be interested in...?

361
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:50,441
- I'm sorry. It's none of my business.
- That's all right.

362
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,812
I'm studying it in college, and I've
come here to write my term paper.

363
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:55,609
Just wait. I'll see what I can find.

364
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:08,456
That's Elizabeth Selwyn.
Burned as a witch, March 3rd, 1692.

365
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,170
Yes, I know. I saw the plaque
in the lobby of the hotel.

366
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,253
- You're staying at the Raven's Inn?
- Yes.

367
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:17,127
It was recommended to rne
by a friend, Professor Driscoll.

368
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:19,219
- Alan Driscoll?
- Yes. Do you know him?

369
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:22,591
No, but my grandfather speaks of him.
His family come from here.

370
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:26,140
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Here. I think this'll do for a start.

371
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:30,515
What a lovely locket. May I see it?

372
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:35,733
- I believe it's quite old.
- Oh, it is. You're very lucky.

373
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:38,280
I'm even more lucky to have found this.

374
00:28:38,856 --> 00:28:41,826
"A Treatise on Devil Worship
in New England".

375
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:43,695
This must be a very rare book.

376
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,538
I'm afraid I couldn't afford to buy it.

377
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:49,037
You can borrow it if you like.

378
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:50,751
Oh, could I? That would be wonderful.

379
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:52,870
I promise I'll bring it back
in a few days.

380
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:55,748
- You're very welcome, Miss...?
- Barlow. Nan Barlow.

381
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:57,216
Nan Barlow.

382
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,631
- Thank you very much. Good night.
- Night.

383
00:29:46,424 --> 00:29:47,926
Mrs Newless!

384
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:51,058
- Mrs Newless?
- Yes, Miss Barlow?

385
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:54,357
L- |- I've heard some strange noises
in my room.

386
00:29:54,474 --> 00:29:57,444
Oh, possibly the water in the pipes.
This is a very old inn.

387
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,813
No, it seemed to be coming
from the cellar underneath.

388
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:01,359
I hardly think so, Miss Barlow.

389
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:03,904
The cellars do not extend
beneath your room.

390
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:06,494
But then why is there
a trap door in the floor?

391
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:10,241
The ground was filled in many years ago
to strengthen the foundations.

392
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:12,867
- But I'm sure...
- If you insist, I will come and see.

393
00:30:22,084 --> 00:30:23,461
I don't hear anything.

394
00:30:25,046 --> 00:30:26,844
Well, just a few minutes ago...

395
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:31,344
- Never mind. I'm sorry.
- You're welcome.

396
00:30:31,469 --> 00:30:33,892
But you can see,
there is no ring in the trap door

397
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:35,811
because there is no reason to lift it.

398
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:38,609
There is nothing underneath but earth.

399
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,852
Come in.

400
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,437
Oh, hello, Lottie. Come in.

401
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:26,365
Oh, I don't need any more towels.
I haven't used mine.

402
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:27,654
They're quite clean.

403
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:40,046
Lottie... I've told you before
not to bother the guests.

404
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,674
Miss Barlow, I thought
you might care to join the others.

405
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:51,800
I will as soon as I finish my notes.
I'll put some clothes on and join them.

406
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:56,020
"A Treatise on Devil Worship
in New England".

407
00:31:56,137 --> 00:31:58,356
Well, do you find this interesting?

408
00:31:58,472 --> 00:31:59,940
Well, it's fascinating.

409
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:03,402
The things I've learnt.
I bet you don't know the half of it.

410
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,398
And you live right here on a spot
where the witches were actually burnt.

411
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:07,899
Listen to this.

412
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:14,239
"On Candlemas Eve,
February 1st, in the year 1692,

413
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:16,957
"a coven of witches... "
a coven, that's 13,

414
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:20,874
some men, some women,
"whose power came from the Devil

415
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:23,043
"gathered beneath the Raven's Inn

416
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:26,384
"to perform a black mass
in the honour of Lucifer.

417
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,425
"The witch, Elizabeth Selwyn,
later to be burnt at the stake,

418
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:32,890
"marked a young girl for sacrifice

419
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:36,887
"by obtaining an object of value
belonging to her, with which to call her.

420
00:32:37,595 --> 00:32:42,146
"And leaving in its place
a dead bird and a sprig of Woodbine.

421
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:45,478
"The witches sacrificed
her on the altar,

422
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:48,106
"and drank her blood at the hour of 13."

423
00:32:49,857 --> 00:32:51,484
What's the hour of 13?

424
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:54,829
Well, personally I have never heard
a clock strike more than 12.

425
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:58,575
- Now, how about joining the dancing?
- In a little while, I promise.

426
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:02,871
Oh, by the way,
I seem to have misplaced my locket.

427
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:05,748
I remember having it in my room,
and now it's disappeared.

428
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:08,046
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll ask Lottie.

429
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,044
Well, I-I'm not saying it was stolen.

430
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:14,015
It's just I remember having it
on the dresser, and now it's gone.

431
00:33:14,131 --> 00:33:15,178
I would appreciate it.

432
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,518
Of course.
I'll look into it immediately.

433
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:31,866
Lottie, I have warned you too often
about annoying our guests.

434
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:34,986
If you disobey me again,
I shall turn you out.

435
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:38,832
And if I turn you out,
there will be no place for you anywhere.

436
00:33:38,948 --> 00:33:40,996
You do understand, Lottie, don't you?

437
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,803
Ah, Miss Barlow.

438
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,014
I'm afraid Lottie is nowhere
to be found.

439
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,178
I will enquire about your locket
first thing in the morning.

440
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:22,927
Oh, thank you.
Where is everybody?

441
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:25,646
Most of the other guests
have gone to the services.

442
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:27,731
Services? On the 1st of February?

443
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:31,068
Candlemas Eve.

444
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:36,198
The night when the witches
mock the rituals of the church.

445
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:38,901
Are you all right, Miss Barlow?

446
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,579
Yes, quite, thank you.

447
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,869
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss Barlow.

448
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,681
Mrs Newless!

449
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:08,431
Mrs Newless! Mrs Newless!

450
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,543
Quiet.

451
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,921
No! No!

452
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:47,468
No! Let go of me!

453
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:50,058
Help! No!

454
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:53,099
Let me go! No!

455
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:56,390
No! Take your hand off me!

456
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:58,358
Let me go!

457
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:05,032
No! No! No!

458
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:06,992
Let go of me! No!

459
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:23,334
Six, seven...

460
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:26,008
No! No, Mrs Newless, no!

461
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:28,968
No! No! No!

462
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:32,309
I am Elizabeth Selwyn.

463
00:39:32,426 --> 00:39:33,678
No! No!

464
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:35,600
- 11...
- No!

465
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:37,815
- Let go of me! Let go!
- 12...

466
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:41,393
13.

467
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,590
Mmm, yummy.

468
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:10,089
Delicious.

469
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:12,592
Dick, have you got any idea
what's happened to Nan?

470
00:40:12,716 --> 00:40:13,683
I'm sure she'll show up.

471
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:16,020
She's probably met
a good-looking he-witch.

472
00:40:16,136 --> 00:40:18,514
Bringing him,
but his broomstick blew a gasket.

473
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,234
It's not like Nan to be late for anything.
Aren't you a bit worried about her?

474
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:24,228
She'll be here.
I'm sure she'll make it.

475
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:26,572
That's probably her now.

476
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:29,032
You answer the door. I'll put
a record on for some dancing.

477
00:40:29,149 --> 00:40:30,071
All right.

478
00:40:35,614 --> 00:40:37,207
- Hi, Dick.
- Bill.

479
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:40,210
What's the matter?
Expecting somebody else?

480
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,625
Oh, yes, Nan.
Come in, come in.

481
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,753
Nan? Isn't she here yet?

482
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:48,753
We made a date to meet here
before she left for Whitewood.

483
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:52,177
Well, she probably got held up.
Look, look, give me your coat.

484
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:54,891
Nan was never late
for anything in her life.

485
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:57,136
Relax. Take it easy.

486
00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:59,059
Enjoy the party. She'll be here.

487
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:04,318
Dick...

488
00:41:06,228 --> 00:41:09,107
Dick, I haven't had a letter from Nan
in over two weeks now.

489
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:11,700
She's probably been too busy
working on her paper.

490
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:13,945
Oh, no. There's something wrong,
I know it.

491
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:15,946
- Will you do something for me?
- Mm-hm.

492
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:19,416
Ring up Whitewood, will ya?
Ask 'em, ask 'em if she's left.

493
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,706
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

494
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:25,372
OK.

495
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:38,347
Hello. Long distance.

496
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:42,519
I'd like to speak with a Miss Nan Barlow
at the Raven's Inn, Whitewood.

497
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,360
No, I don't have a phone number.

498
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:47,978
What, didn't she give you
the phone number?

499
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:50,652
Why, no, but that's my sister.

500
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:58,580
They say there's no such place
as the Raven's Inn.

501
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,950
But that's crazy.
She's staying there.

502
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,212
Give me the police.

503
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:11,301
She left in such a hurry,

504
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:14,137
she must have forgotten
to return it to you, Miss Russell.

505
00:42:14,254 --> 00:42:16,097
She seemed such a nice girl, too.

506
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:18,889
Wouldn't have thought
she was the sort who'd forget.

507
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:22,013
We cannot always judge
by our first impressions, can we?

508
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:25,642
I'm not usually wrong about
the people I lend my books to.

509
00:42:25,766 --> 00:42:28,110
Well, perhaps
you'll be more careful in future.

510
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:32,152
- Thank you for letting me have it.
- Remember me to your grandfather.

511
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:40,664
Lottie! Get out of the way,
you clumsy creature.

512
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,503
- Can I help you?
- We're from the Sheriff's office.

513
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:55,971
We had a call this evening.

514
00:42:56,088 --> 00:42:59,183
A missing person report
for some college kid named Nan Barlow.

515
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,429
The party calling said her last known
whereabouts was the Raven's Inn.

516
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:06,773
Nan Barlow. That's strange.
Yes, I met her.

517
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,312
When did you last see her?

518
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:09,480
About two weeks ago.

519
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:11,569
She came to my shop,
and borrowed this book.

520
00:43:11,687 --> 00:43:12,654
It's quite valuable,

521
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:15,820
and not hearing from her,
I decided to come and get it.

522
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:17,284
Mrs Newless had it.

523
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:18,778
- May I?
- Yes.

524
00:43:20,529 --> 00:43:22,372
"A Treatise on Devil Worship"?

525
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:25,038
I must put this in the report.

526
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:28,955
Peculiar things some of these
college kids do nowadays.

527
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:31,753
Well, thanks for your help.
Come on, Charlie.

528
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:14,500
Hello?

529
00:44:14,624 --> 00:44:16,171
Yeah.

530
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,842
It's the police.

531
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:22,845
Yeah.

532
00:44:24,384 --> 00:44:26,307
OK, thanks.

533
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:27,520
Thank you.

534
00:44:28,513 --> 00:44:29,981
Well?

535
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:32,897
The police sent a car
out to the Raven's Inn.

536
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,565
Nan checked out two weeks ago.

537
00:44:35,604 --> 00:44:38,278
- I don't get it.
- Well, neither do I.

538
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:40,867
Look, these are Nan's books and papers.

539
00:44:40,984 --> 00:44:44,534
Go through them. See if you can find
anything which might give us a lead.

540
00:44:44,654 --> 00:44:46,952
I'm gonna pay a visit
to a colleague of mine.

541
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:12,933
Oh, Lord of Light,
accept this sacrifice.

542
00:45:58,228 --> 00:46:00,401
- Why, Barlow.
- May I come in?

543
00:46:00,522 --> 00:46:03,571
Well, yes, of course. Please do.
Can I take your coat?

544
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:06,445
I tried to phone you last night,
but I guess you weren't in.

545
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,038
No... No, I wasn't.

546
00:46:09,156 --> 00:46:11,329
Would you care to go in the study?

547
00:46:14,286 --> 00:46:16,254
- Sit yourself down.
- Thanks.

548
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:20,550
You take a drink?

549
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,294
Brown soda.

550
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:24,797
- Ice?
- Please.

551
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,433
- Now what's on your mind?
- Well, Nan's missing.

552
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:31,599
And she has been since the day after
she arrived at Whitewood.

553
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,222
Really? You quite sure?

554
00:46:34,014 --> 00:46:35,516
It's what the police said.

555
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,985
- What are they doing about it?
- Carrying out a routine check.

556
00:46:39,102 --> 00:46:40,729
I don't suppose they can much more

557
00:46:40,854 --> 00:46:42,697
until they've got something
definite to go on.

558
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:45,283
I would have thought
there was a great deal more.

559
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,244
What? As far as they're concerned,
she disappeared two weeks ago,

560
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:50,830
and no one in the village
seems to know anything about it.

561
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:54,372
- What have you come to see me for?
- I thought you might have some ideas.

562
00:46:55,452 --> 00:46:59,082
- Why did you send her to Whitewood?
- It was the best place for her research.

563
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:02,210
- You suggested she stay at the Raven's Inn.
- It's the only inn there is.

564
00:47:02,334 --> 00:47:03,836
With an unlisted phone number.

565
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,179
The inn has its own clientele,
it doesn't need to advertise.

566
00:47:06,296 --> 00:47:09,926
- How do you know it so well?
- Because I was born in Whitewood.

567
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,473
I see. Then you'd have every
reason to believe

568
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:14,096
she'd be perfectly safe
in going there.

569
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:16,690
I've no reason to
suppose she wouldn't be.

570
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:20,026
Nan struck me as being perfectly capable
of taking care of herself.

571
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:23,647
I grant you that, but why hasn't she
come back, or let us know?

572
00:47:23,772 --> 00:47:25,194
I can understand your anxiety,

573
00:47:25,315 --> 00:47:27,989
but I'm quite sure there's
nothing for you to worry about.

574
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:31,909
She's probably got absorbed on the
subject, and gone off someplace.

575
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:34,158
I wish that all my class
had her application.

576
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:37,286
Yeah, well, I'm gonna find out
where this application led her.

577
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,458
I'm going to retrace
every step Nan took.

578
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,458
I'm either gonna find Nan,
or know what happened to her!

579
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:55,437
- I can't stop you from going.
- No.

580
00:47:55,554 --> 00:47:58,524
- You're not afraid?
- Afraid? Why?

581
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,611
If anything did happen to your sister,
and somebody went to find out about it...

582
00:48:02,727 --> 00:48:05,697
- The same thing might happen to them?
- Possible.

583
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:08,237
You seem to think something
happened to my sister?

584
00:48:08,358 --> 00:48:10,110
No. You are jumping to conclusions.

585
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:12,784
Really? I shall find her.

586
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,207
- Professor Driscoll?
- Yes.

587
00:48:16,324 --> 00:48:18,497
I don't like to disturb you,
but may I see you?

588
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:20,211
Of course. Please come in.

589
00:48:20,328 --> 00:48:22,126
- Good luck in Whitewood.
- Thanks.

590
00:48:24,165 --> 00:48:26,668
I'm sorry, but did you say
he was going to Whitewood?

591
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:28,261
Yes, he is.

592
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:31,848
It's silly to be surprised,
but I've just come from Whitewood.

593
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,019
Really? It's quite a coincidence.

594
00:48:36,136 --> 00:48:38,980
My family happens to come
from Whitewood. I was born there.

595
00:48:39,097 --> 00:48:40,895
- Yes, I know.
- Please sit down.

596
00:48:41,016 --> 00:48:42,359
Thank you.

597
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,567
- Care for a drink?
- No, thank you.

598
00:48:48,356 --> 00:48:51,200
I think you know my grandfather,
the Reverend Russell.

599
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:54,412
Russell? Oh, yes, of course I do.

600
00:48:54,529 --> 00:48:56,452
How long have you been living
in Whitewood?

601
00:48:56,573 --> 00:48:58,575
Since my grandmother died
a few weeks ago.

602
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,043
Oh, I'm sorry.

603
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:02,170
Well, now how can I help you?

604
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:05,632
I've come about a pupil of yours?
Barlow.

605
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:08,218
- Nan Barlow?
- Yes.

606
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:11,179
She came to Whitewood two weeks ago.
I met her and liked her.

607
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,970
She told me that she was a student
in one of your classes.

608
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,435
That you recommended
that she stay at the Raven's Inn.

609
00:49:17,552 --> 00:49:18,895
It's quite right, I did.

610
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:20,980
That's what I've come to see you about.

611
00:49:21,097 --> 00:49:23,646
On the day after she arrived,
she disappeared.

612
00:49:23,767 --> 00:49:26,065
- Oh?
- Later the police came asking questions.

613
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:28,188
The family were worried.

614
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:29,530
I thought you might
have their address.

615
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:31,446
Why do you want her family's address?

616
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,320
Because I have something of hers
I want to return.

617
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:39,457
Leave it with me,
and I'll make sure they get it safely.

618
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:44,087
I don't want to trouble you.
If you just give me their address...

619
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:47,082
As you wish.

620
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:51,670
Her address is Dorchester Street.

621
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:55,307
225. She lives with her brother.

622
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:57,721
He's a colleague of mine.
You just met him.

623
00:49:57,842 --> 00:49:59,185
He was leaving when you arrived.

624
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:02,855
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a lot of work to do.

625
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:04,645
I'm rather a busy man at the moment.

626
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:08,066
- Thank you for your help.
- Not at all. I hope it achieves something.

627
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:13,158
- Remember me to your grandfather.
- Yes, of course. Goodbye.

628
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:15,110
Goodbye, Miss Russell.

629
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,754
Yeah, it's Nan's locket, all right.

630
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:28,795
As far as I know, it's unique.

631
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:30,167
I gave it to her.
Where did you get it?

632
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,135
The servant at the inn gave it to me.
It was strange.

633
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:35,301
I don't think she wanted Mrs Newless
to know I had it.

634
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:37,800
- Mrs Newless?
- She runs the inn.

635
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:40,677
Oh. Why did you come here,
Miss... Miss Russell?

636
00:50:40,802 --> 00:50:42,304
I found this.

637
00:50:45,265 --> 00:50:47,267
It's Professor Drisc0ll's notepaper.

638
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:51,067
I found it in a book I lent your sister
on her first evening in Whitewood.

639
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:53,940
When she didn't return it,
I went to the hotel.

640
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:57,569
- What was the book?
- An old book. A book about witchcraft.

641
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:01,115
Do you believe in it, Miss Russell?

642
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:04,789
I don't know. Sometimes I think
I almost live with it.

643
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:06,001
Live with it?

644
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:10,458
It's an obsession of my grandfather's.
Up till now I didn't take him seriously.

645
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:12,084
He's an old man.

646
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,757
But now I'm beginning to wonder
if what he says isn't true.

647
00:51:14,878 --> 00:51:16,130
What does he say?

648
00:51:16,796 --> 00:51:19,140
That there's something evil
about the village.

649
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:22,887
And on a certain night the inhabitants
leave the streets, close their doors

650
00:51:23,011 --> 00:51:24,604
and stay behind them.

651
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:28,146
That on these nights
the dead come to life.

652
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:30,561
Nights like Candlemas Eve?

653
00:51:31,811 --> 00:51:33,905
What do you know about Candlemas Eve?

654
00:51:34,564 --> 00:51:35,986
It's in one of Nan's books.

655
00:51:44,908 --> 00:51:47,878
I don't believe it!
Things like this don't happen today.

656
00:51:49,621 --> 00:51:51,043
In Whitewood I wonder.

657
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:54,259
I'm going to Whitewood tomorrow
after classes. I can give you a lift.

658
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:56,586
Thank you, but I must get back.

659
00:51:56,711 --> 00:51:58,805
I can't leave my grandfather alone.
He's blind.

660
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:02,643
May I come and see you when I arrive?
I'd... I'd like to have a talk with him.

661
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:05,683
Please do. It's the house
next to the church. Goodbye.

662
00:52:05,804 --> 00:52:07,932
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you to the door.

663
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:35,133
- Would you be going to Whitewood?
- Yes.

664
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,254
Would you take me along with you?
It's a dark night for walking.

665
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:53,811
You're the Reverend Russell's
granddaughter, aren't you?

666
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:57,530
- Yes, how did you know?
- I know a great deal about Whitewood.

667
00:52:57,647 --> 00:52:59,900
- Have you ever been there?
- Now and then.

668
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:04,246
- I've never seen you.
- To see me is a special privilege.

669
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:06,410
It's reserved for a chosen few.

670
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:09,083
What does that mean?

671
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:13,079
We'll soon be at Whitewood now.

672
00:53:19,252 --> 00:53:21,880
This is as far as I go. You will...

673
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:40,319
She's pretty, too.

674
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,943
Yes, she is. Very pretty.

675
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,820
A living descendant
of those who were cursed.

676
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,078
It somehow seems to make it better.

677
00:53:57,165 --> 00:53:58,963
Another day.

678
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,585
And tomorrow...

679
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:04,631
The Witches' Sabbath.

680
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,773
Which way to Wamport Road?

681
00:54:58,893 --> 00:55:02,272
Straight ahead. Fork in the road.
You see a sign, turn left.

682
00:55:02,397 --> 00:55:04,320
- You heading for Whitewood?
- I am.

683
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,363
- Many people head this way?
- Not many.

684
00:55:06,484 --> 00:55:08,361
Is this the only way
in and out of the town?

685
00:55:08,486 --> 00:55:09,829
In this direction, yep.

686
00:55:09,946 --> 00:55:11,493
You wouldn't remember by any chance

687
00:55:11,614 --> 00:55:14,037
a pretty girl in a convertible
about a month ago?

688
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:17,378
The Barlow girl. Read about her
in the papers. Never seen her again.

689
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:19,293
- I told the police.
- Thanks.

690
00:55:43,062 --> 00:55:45,315
Could you tell me the way
to Whitewood, please?

691
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,908
Another one. Straight ahead.

692
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:48,948
Fork in the road. See a sign,
"Wamport Road",

693
00:55:49,068 --> 00:55:50,445
turn left as you ride in.

694
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,196
All right, thanks.

695
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,244
Let me warn you, young fellow.
They don't like strangers in Whitewood.

696
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:57,039
OK. Fine. Thanks very much.

697
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,503
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

698
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,997
I'd like a room, please.

699
00:57:24,122 --> 00:57:25,749
The inn is closing.

700
00:57:25,873 --> 00:57:27,841
Well, I'll only be here a few days.

701
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,302
But the inn is closing.

702
00:57:29,418 --> 00:57:30,920
- When?
- In two days.

703
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:33,264
If you don't mind,
I'd like to stay until then.

704
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,717
If you insist.

705
00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:43,316
And could I... could I have
the same room my, my sister had?

706
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:46,527
- It's still available, isn't it?
- Yes, it's available.

707
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:49,985
Mrs Newless, you told the police
that my sister checked out.

708
00:57:50,106 --> 00:57:51,983
You are mistaken, Mr Barlow.

709
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:53,985
I told them that on the morning
of February 2nd,

710
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,033
I went to her room
and found it empty.

711
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:58,953
Her bed not slept in.
Her luggage and car gone.

712
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:00,416
And her bill unpaid.

713
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:02,627
Well, you can put the charges on mine.

714
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:06,088
- When was the last time you saw her?
- On the evening of February 1st.

715
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:07,331
It was shortly before midnight.

716
00:58:07,456 --> 00:58:09,834
She'd been in the lobby
dancing with some of the guests.

717
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:11,882
She seemed to be enjoying herself.

718
00:58:12,003 --> 00:58:15,598
Did any particular guest
pay special attention to her?

719
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:19,310
Not that I noticed.
Your sister kept very much to herself.

720
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:21,429
You know why she came to Whitewood?

721
00:58:22,138 --> 00:58:25,233
It is not my habit to enquire
into people's private business.

722
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:27,943
Would the fact
that she was investigating witchcraft

723
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,108
antagonised anyone in the village.

724
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,654
Hardly. There have been
other students here, you know.

725
00:58:33,774 --> 00:58:37,028
Besides, your sister was a very
agreeable and likeable young woman.

726
00:58:37,153 --> 00:58:39,531
Well, have you any idea
where she might have gone?

727
00:58:40,281 --> 00:58:42,124
- None.
- Thank you.

728
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:44,285
Now, may I see the room?

729
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,378
As you wish. It is this way.

730
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:01,765
If you should need anything,
and I am not at the desk,

731
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:03,433
you have only to ring the bell.

732
00:59:03,554 --> 00:59:04,897
Thank you.

733
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:41,869
- Hello.
- I'm so glad you've come.

734
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,164
I saw your car outside
the Raven's Inn earlier.

735
01:00:45,281 --> 01:00:46,624
I wondered what had happened to you.

736
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:50,541
I've been talking with Mrs Newless, and
then I took a walk around the village.

737
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:52,004
Find out anything?

738
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,379
Everyone here seems
to be afraid of something.

739
01:00:55,499 --> 01:00:57,752
Then you don't think
it's just my imagination?

740
01:00:57,877 --> 01:01:01,097
I don't know. Who's to say where
imagination ends and truth begins?

741
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:02,886
It's nothing tangible. It's...

742
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,343
Just the way they look at you.

743
01:01:05,468 --> 01:01:07,470
I felt it too.

744
01:01:07,595 --> 01:01:10,064
May I see the...
the book that Nan borrowed?

745
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:14,402
Yes, I put a marker between the pages
where she must have stopped reading.

746
01:01:14,518 --> 01:01:17,021
Sit down, and I'll tell my
grandfather you're here.

747
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:18,489
Thank you.

748
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:08,364
I warned you, Lottie.

749
01:02:39,854 --> 01:02:41,731
Grandfather, this is Mr Barlow.

750
01:02:41,856 --> 01:02:43,199
How do you do, sir?

751
01:02:43,315 --> 01:02:44,817
God be with you.

752
01:02:44,942 --> 01:02:47,570
Shall we sit where we'll
be more comfortable?

753
01:02:50,573 --> 01:02:53,076
Here's your chair, Grandfather.
You must be tired.

754
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,578
I am. Really tired.

755
01:02:55,703 --> 01:02:59,207
I have little strength left these days
for the fight.

756
01:02:59,999 --> 01:03:02,093
Won't you sit down?
I'll make some coffee.

757
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:03,836
Fight against what, Mr Russell?

758
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:06,931
Against the evil that
besets this village.

759
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,592
The people are creatures of the Devil.

760
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:11,640
They know no other God.

761
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,808
You mean they worship Satan
here? Today?

762
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:17,650
Satanism was never stronger
than at the present time.

763
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:21,896
For 200 years the people of Whitewood
have carried out rituals

764
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:24,319
that mock the Church's teaching.

765
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,784
I find it very hard to believe, sir.

766
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:28,995
Do not doubt, my son.

767
01:03:29,111 --> 01:03:31,034
It is real enough.

768
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:33,874
For years I struggled
against the witches.

769
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,953
Their master took away my sight.

770
01:03:37,077 --> 01:03:38,420
It seems incredible.

771
01:03:38,537 --> 01:03:41,131
I have tried to convince others.

772
01:03:41,248 --> 01:03:44,047
They too found it unbelievable.

773
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:47,889
But I know these people
have a pact with the Devil.

774
01:03:48,005 --> 01:03:51,430
To worship him and do his works.

775
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:54,975
In return he gives them eternal life.

776
01:03:55,095 --> 01:03:56,893
- Eternal life?
- Aye.

777
01:03:57,014 --> 01:04:02,145
And to seal this bargain
they must sacrifice a young girl

778
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:04,112
on two nights of the year.

779
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,573
When are these nights, sir?

780
01:04:05,689 --> 01:04:09,444
Candlemas Eve
and the Witches' Sabbath.

781
01:04:09,568 --> 01:04:13,038
Candlemas Eve.
That's, that's February the 1st.

782
01:04:13,155 --> 01:04:15,749
- And when is the Witches' Sabbath?
- Tonight.

783
01:04:15,866 --> 01:04:17,664
Now you know why I came to see you.

784
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:21,629
I had no idea it was so late.

785
01:04:21,747 --> 01:04:23,795
May I... may I have a
rain check on the coffee?

786
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:26,510
I'd like to have a few words
with Mrs Newless again.

787
01:04:26,627 --> 01:04:29,130
- Of course.
- Good night, sir.

788
01:04:29,255 --> 01:04:31,223
- Good night.
- I'll see you to the door.

789
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:36,725
God be with us.

790
01:04:37,263 --> 01:04:39,982
Miss Russell,
do you think that Nan's disappearance

791
01:04:40,099 --> 01:04:43,694
is connected in some way
with these... witches' ceremonies?

792
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:45,233
Yes.

793
01:04:45,354 --> 01:04:48,198
Well, I'd... I'd like
to come back later, if I may.

794
01:04:48,315 --> 01:04:51,615
- Please do. And my name is Pat.
- And mine's Richard.

795
01:04:51,735 --> 01:04:53,487
I think I feel better now you're here.

796
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:57,116
Well, I'm... I'm gonna stay
until I find out what's happened to Nan.

797
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,618
Take care.

798
01:05:10,129 --> 01:05:12,473
Now drink your coffee
before it gets cold.

799
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:15,810
You must not see
that young man again tonight.

800
01:05:16,468 --> 01:05:19,938
- Why not?
- The Devil comes in many disguises.

801
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,232
I'll get you a spoon.

802
01:05:25,853 --> 01:05:29,574
Grandfather, there's a bird in the
drawer. It's got an arrow through it.

803
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:32,614
Go and look on the front door.

804
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:43,288
- It's a sprig of Woodbine.
- Shut the door! Shut the door quickly!

805
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:49,169
- Grandfather, what does it mean?
- Now, listen, my darling.

806
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:52,217
This is their sign. The witches' sign.

807
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,178
- What can we do?
- We must leave here.

808
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:56,892
Leave here immediately.

809
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:04,688
I'll start the car.

810
01:06:16,362 --> 01:06:17,784
Somethings wrong.

811
01:06:20,366 --> 01:06:22,118
They've wrecked the car.

812
01:06:22,743 --> 01:06:25,041
Barlow! Phone Barlow!

813
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:32,591
Hello? Hello?

814
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,302
Hello. I want the Raven's Inn.

815
01:06:42,763 --> 01:06:44,731
Yes? Mrs Newless.

816
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,693
Mr Barlow?

817
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,733
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

818
01:06:51,605 --> 01:06:52,606
Hello?

819
01:06:52,731 --> 01:06:56,156
Dick, I'm in terrible danger.
We've got to leave Whitewood at once.

820
01:06:56,276 --> 01:06:58,278
Danger? But from what?

821
01:06:58,404 --> 01:07:00,327
'We've got to leave...'

822
01:07:00,447 --> 01:07:02,324
- Pat? Patricia!
- 'Please help me!'

823
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:04,869
Pat!

824
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:17,802
Patricia! Pat!

825
01:07:23,345 --> 01:07:24,813
Pat!

826
01:07:26,724 --> 01:07:28,101
Patricia!

827
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:31,228
Mr Russell, are you there?

828
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:40,821
Mr Russell.

829
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:44,082
What's happened, Mr Russell?

830
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:45,746
The witches...

831
01:07:45,868 --> 01:07:48,712
The witches... have Patricia.

832
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,422
Destroy them.

833
01:07:50,539 --> 01:07:53,793
- Mr Russell, how?
- The shadow of the cross.

834
01:07:54,376 --> 01:07:56,253
Use the cross.

835
01:07:57,171 --> 01:08:01,768
I adjure thee, O creatures of salt

836
01:08:01,884 --> 01:08:04,478
by the living God.

837
01:08:06,013 --> 01:08:07,560
Mr Russell.

838
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:18,400
Maitland! Maitland,
what, what's happened?

839
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:11,954
Pat! Patricia!

840
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:38,280
Hello? Hello, operator?

841
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,857
Damn!

842
01:12:15,846 --> 01:12:17,223
Pat!

843
01:12:19,307 --> 01:12:20,934
We've been waiting for you.

844
01:12:23,145 --> 01:12:26,115
Dick, these are the dead
who killed Nan!

845
01:12:26,231 --> 01:12:27,574
Barlow!

846
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:31,904
Please help me!

847
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:41,163
Come on, Pat! Hurry up!

848
01:12:42,205 --> 01:12:44,003
Quick! This way!

849
01:12:52,799 --> 01:12:54,597
Dick!

850
01:12:58,764 --> 01:13:00,437
Dick!

851
01:13:18,575 --> 01:13:19,918
No!

852
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:22,288
- Pat!
- Dick!

853
01:13:55,153 --> 01:13:59,533
Maitland! Get to a cross! A cross!

854
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:02,119
A shadow of a cross!

855
01:14:39,906 --> 01:14:41,249
Dick! Dick, he's moving!

856
01:14:46,288 --> 01:14:48,666
Lift the cross!

857
01:14:55,547 --> 01:14:56,890
Quick!

858
01:15:08,018 --> 01:15:11,818
O creatures of salt,
I adjure thee by the living God.

859
01:15:16,818 --> 01:15:18,161
Back from the cross!

860
01:15:18,278 --> 01:15:20,030
Come nearer, Bill.

861
01:15:20,155 --> 01:15:23,955
- Get the shadow over them!
- It comes nearer.

862
01:15:25,952 --> 01:15:29,547
We dare not fail.
We must finish the sacrifice.

863
01:15:32,959 --> 01:15:34,302
- Dick!
- Pat!

864
01:15:34,419 --> 01:15:36,968
Wait. Wait for the hour of 13.

865
01:16:05,408 --> 01:16:07,251
Pat, are you all right?

866
01:16:07,869 --> 01:16:09,246
I think so.

867
01:16:15,043 --> 01:16:16,511
Bill!

868
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:25,095
I have a score to
settle with Mrs Newless.

869
01:16:40,193 --> 01:16:42,036
You stay here.
