1
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,270
Well, we finished earlier
than Ike and I expected.

2
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,050
- Are you going anywhere?
- No, I don't think so.

3
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,090
So the next time, I changed to
another tailor, but found out
that he was no better than the first.

4
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,080
I bought some pretty expensive cloth
and took it to him and you should've
seen the mess he made of it.

5
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,210
I told him I wouldn't pay for the thing,
but the trouble is, he's got my material.

6
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,660
Well, I left the suit with him
and it's been there ever since.

7
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,390
- Good evening, Miss White.
And how are you?

8
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,270
- I'm all right, thanks.
- I haven't seen you for a long time.

9
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,290
Have you come to take Frank for a walk.

10
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,190
- Yes.
- That's right. Well, I must push along.

11
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,660
- Good-night.
- Good-night, Frank.

12
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,280
- Well, dear.
- I've been waiting here half an hour for you.

13
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,210
- Good-night, Sean.
- Good-night, Frank.

14
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,200
Good-night, George.

15
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,330
- Sorry sir. Full up. You'll
have more room upstairs.
- Goaaannn.

16
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,580
I think I told you, there's
more room upstairs!

17
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,150
Sorry Sir. Full up here.
There's more room up...HEY!

18
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,830
Frank. I've lost one of my gloves.
I think I left it at the other table.

19
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,220
- Is this it?
- Yes, thanks.

20
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,320
Thought so, there's a
hole in two fingers.

21
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,340
Would you like a pair of
nail scissors for Christmas?

22
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,270
- Funny, aren't you?

23
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,940
- Oh Miss, Miss!

24
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,150
It's no good being impatient,
you'll have to wait your turn.

25
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,500
What's the matter with you today?
Got out of bed the wrong side?

26
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,720
- I don't like waiting about for you.
- Oh, don't you? Oh, Miss!

27
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,820
Do you expect the entire
machinery of Scotland Yard

28
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,040
to be held up to please you?

29
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,490
You and your Scotland Yard!

30
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,710
If it weren't for Edgar Wallace
nobody'd ever heard of it.

31
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,780
Funny, aren't you?

32
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,900
Anyway, what's the hurry? We're only going
to the pictures, we've got all evening.

33
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,470
- Well, I don't think I want
to go to the pictures.
- Oh, and why not?

34
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,680
- I've seen everything worth seeing.
- You haven't seen "Fingerprints".
I'd like to see that.

35
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,740
Still it's about Scotland Yard!
might be amusing. They're bound
to get all the details wrong.

36
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,780
I don't see why. I did hear they'd
got a real criminal to direct it.

37
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,560
- So as to be on the safe side.
- Oh, oh Miss!

38
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,600
Oh, blast!

39
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,920
Well, I've ordered.

40
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,550
- I'll go to the pictures with you, if you like.
- uh, changed your mind.

41
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,480
Have you got an ashtray Miss? I never
seem to get an ashtray where I sit.

42
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,090
Frank, Frank. I've changed my
mind again.

43
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,470
- About what?
- About going to the pictures.

44
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,380
- You mean you don't want to go again?
- No, not particularly.

45
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,950
- Why not?
- I don't know, I just don't want to.

46
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,920
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not enough. oy, Miss!

47
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,230
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to get the bill.

48
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,820
I'm about fed up with you. If you
don't want to go, I do.

49
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,380
- Oh all right, I'll come too.
- oy, Miss!

50
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,140
Oh, don't let's have a row. I'm sorry.
I know I've been rather beastly today.

51
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,740
- Miss!
- Frank, I've said I'm sorry.

52
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,720
Here, that will cover it.

53
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,950
Hold on. I live here.

54
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,010
Do you? Then you
needn't come any further.

55
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,930
Oh, no now I said that I'd
see you home, and I will.

56
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,010
But I'm only just around the corner.
Do you know Whites? The newsagent?

57
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,600
- Yes? - In the Kings road?
- Yes. - That's my father.

58
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,890
- No!
- Yes!

59
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,890
Now isn't that fine?
Then we're neighbors.

60
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:22,770
- Have you ever seen an artist's studio?
- No, I'd love to.

61
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:29,370
- Come up and see mine.
- Oh, I can't now. Another time.

62
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,620
- Why not now?
- Why, it's so late.

63
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,950
- Are you frightened?
- No, course not.

64
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,380
Then why not now?

65
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,020
No, really. Thanks awfully.
I must be getting home.

66
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,310
- You are frightened.
- I'm certainly not. Take
more'n a man to frighten me.

67
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,910
Yes...that's what I thought...
at first.

68
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,860
- What is the time?
- Not very late.

69
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,670
- Come on. What's the harm.

70
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,020
Oh, no harm really. Besides,
I always think a girl knows
instinctively when she can trust a man.

71
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,490
Yes, of course she does.
Do you trust me?

72
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,780
- Alice? May I call you Alice?
- If you like.

73
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,950
Come on.

74
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,860
- Oh Mr. Crewe. Before you go in, could I...?
- Excuse me, miss.

75
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,140
No!

76
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,600
That chap's nothing but a sponger.
Always pestering people up and
down this street.

77
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,550
Well, here we are.

78
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,580
I'm right up there. Top!
Excuse me a minute, will you?

79
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,300
I say, I'm awfully sorry. I won't
be a minute. You start walking up.

80
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,920
That's all right.

81
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,730
Oh good evening. Sorry to disturb you.
About this note, did he leave any message?

82
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,670
No, he wouldn't leave any
message.

83
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,210
- Have you seen him before.
- Yes, the same gent what
called here several times.

84
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,980
I see. Thanks very much. Goodnight.

85
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,490
Bit of a climb, wasn't it?

86
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,030
What a lovely room.
Did you do it all yourself?

87
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,440
Hardly. I say, do you feel cold?
I think I'll light the fire.

88
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,630
- I say. That's good, isn't it?

89
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,740
- Oh that? Yes, that's a new one,
just finished.

90
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,120
- How do you hold this?
- What?

91
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,200
Oh, that.

92
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,700
That's easy. I'll show you.

93
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,610
Oh Lord, not like that. Let me show you.

94
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,320
You take this and hold it like that,
you see...Then you get the brush

95
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,000
and hold it there. You try.

96
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,610
- Like this?
- Yes.

97
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,110
- Oh, look what I've done.
- Ooo, yes

98
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,550
- Draw something Alice.

99
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,150
- Shall I?
- Yes.

100
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,280
Rotten.

101
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,740
Never mind. We'll finish this
masterpiece together.

102
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,610
Now you hold the brush. Steady.

103
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,550
There we are.

104
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,900
You are awful.

105
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,350
Wait a minute.

106
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,840
- There.
- Hooray! Already a pick ahead of me.

107
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,380
- I'll go and get those drinks...
- Right you are.

108
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,570
I say,

109
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,070
how would I do for one of your models?

110
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,560
That's an idea.

111
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,210
Let's see it on you.

112
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,610
- Do you mean, put it on?
- Yes, why not?

113
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,160
- Oh, it's so strong!
- Go on...

114
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,140
Oh no, I don't think so. Besides I
have to go home soon.

115
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,720
I see.

116
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,080
Pity. I would have like to have
sketched you in it.

117
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,860
- Would you have really?
- Yes, but perhaps you are right.
It wouldn't suit you.

118
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,890
I bet it would.

119
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,200
- Shall I really try it on?
- Yes, will you?

120
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,080
- All right.
- Good.

121
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,070
- Do you think this will be big enough for me.
- What?

122
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,560
- I said, do you think this
will be big enough for me.
- Yes, I think so.

123
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,750
- Go on, play something.
- Wait a minute, how does that thing go?

124
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,370
I know.

125
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,340
And that's a song about you, my dear.

126
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,800
You haven't said how you like it.

127
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,270
Marvellous.

128
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:18,160
- I can't do it up.
- Wait a minute. Where is this trouble?

129
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,870
- I can't do it all up.
- Never mind.

130
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,820
- How do I look?
- Well... wait a minute, it isn't quite right.

131
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,820
Put your hands there.

132
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,070
- I better go.
- I say.

133
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,080
I've got it.

134
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,760
- Please give it to me.
- All right, come on out.

135
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,830
There it is.

136
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,480
Don't be silly, Alice. Don't be silly.

137
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,380
No, no, let me go! Let me go!

138
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,650
No, no....

139
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,720
- Who did you say it was?
- Mr. Crewe!
- Mr. Who?

140
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,180
- No! Crewe, I tell you! It's horrible!

141
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,800
- All right. Don't you worry. I'll send round
straight away. What number did you say?

142
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,100
Seven or eleven?
- 31.
- 31?

143
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
- What?
- 31, I said.

144
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,330
- No, no, 31.

145
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,080
- Ah good. Just take a look around,
will you? - Right you are sir.

146
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,320
- Alice, wake up.

147
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,470
Anyone'd think you hadn't
been asleep all night.

148
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,780
What do you think!? There's been a
murder last night, round the corner.

149
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,110
And they tell me
the police are round there now.

150
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,640
We'll all be murdered in our
beds, soon, I'm sure we will.

151
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,970
'cause I don't think the
police are what they were.

152
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,120
Morning, Alice. 'eard about the murder?
- Yes, I heard.

153
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,610
- Do you remember Frank's
telephone number, dad?

154
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,740
- No, but here, you'll
find it in the book.

155
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,310
- I mean, some murders are so
different to others, aren't they?

156
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,670
Pushed his lady friends under the
water when they was having a bath.

157
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,560
What was his name, you remember?

158
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,270
I think that was ever so beastly.

159
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,200
It gave me the shivers.

160
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,590
After I read about it, I didn't
dare 'ave a bath for a month.

161
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,400
An' for weeks after that I
only used to 'ave a rinse down.

162
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,640
What was his name, you remember?

163
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,580
Smith, wasn't it?

164
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:32,450
What's wrong Alice? You don't look
very cheerful this morning.

165
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,330
- You do look a little bit peaky, I must say.
- Dad, Alice, breakfast!

166
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,240
- Good-morning, Mr. White.
- Good-morning, Sir, good-morning.

167
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,870
Breakfast!?

168
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,480
I couldn't look bak'n in the face
after what happened last night...

169
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,940
and under our very noses.

170
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,530
Mind you, I don't think, myself,
it's all together the police's fault.

171
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,790
What I mean is, they 'ave
to wink at some things.

172
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,660
I mean it's one thing to buy
chocolates out of hours,

173
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,600
but it's quite another to stick
a knife into a gentleman.

174
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,260
I must say I feel the
same way about that too.

175
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:08,280
A good, clean, honest whack over
the 'ead with a brick is one thing....

176
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,720
...something British about
that. But knives?

177
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,050
No. Knives is not right.

178
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,170
I must say that's what I think
and that's what I'll keep.

179
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,750
Whatever the provocation,
I could never use a knife.

180
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,170
Now, mind you a knife is
a difficult thing to handle.

181
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,270
I mean any knife...

182
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,680
...knife.... knife....

183
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,080
...a butcher's knife...

184
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,720
- Alice, cut us a bit of bread, will you?

185
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:44,500
Knife.... knife.... of a knife....
...you come up against a knife!

186
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,720
I mean, in Chelsea you mustn't use a..

187
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,560
KNIFE!

188
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,490
- Dear, you ought to be more careful.

189
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,790
You might have cut somebody with that.

190
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,040
Customer...

191
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,600
- No news of the murder yet?
- No, not yet.

192
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,320
- Thank you. Good-morning.

193
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,730
- Well, I must be going. I can't stand
here gossiping all day like some people.

194
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:32,710
Chatter, chatter, chatter.... give
'em a chance to talk about other
people's business, and they'll take it.

195
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,620
- What's the matter Alice?
Had another row with Frank?

196
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,880
- Another customer, Alice.

197
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,340
- Good morning, Alice.

198
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,690
- Dear, it's Frank. Hello Frank.

199
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,440
- I say, have you 'eard about our murder?
- Yes, they put me on it.

200
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:30,010
- Did they? That's good isn't it?
Well, I hope you get him Frank!

201
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,190
- If they do, that will mean
promotion, won't it?

202
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,920
- D'you reck'n you'll get him soon?

203
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,800
- Well, uh, I don't know.

204
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,770
- Well, I came in here to phone.
- That's all right.

205
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,460
- Alice? Come here a minute will you?

206
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,310
- Well I must be going now. Good-bye,
Mrs. White, good-bye, Mr. White.

207
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,860
Now you two.

208
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,960
- Sssshhhh..... Be careful...

209
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,580
What happened last night?

210
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,140
Why don't you tell me?

211
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,830
Look, you know where I found that?

212
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,850
It's the only piece of evidence that you
were there. I'm keeping it back at present.

213
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,830
For God's sake, say something!

214
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,530
- If you're not using the
phone...uh, may I?

215
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,020
I, uh, I want to get on to Scotland Yard.

216
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,680
- I say.

217
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,200
- I want the best cigar in the shop.

218
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,170
Certainly sir. Perhaps you'd like to
telephone while I get it down?

219
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,670
- No, thanks, that can wait.
- What does he mean?

220
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,840
- Very well sir. Now, uh, what sort of
a cigar would you like sir? I've got..

221
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,210
I've got 'enry Clay or Corona, Corona?

222
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,290
- Corona.

223
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,140
- Certainly sir.

224
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:13,720
- Any news of the murder.
- No, nothing yet.

225
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,050
- Have you heard anything?

226
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,810
- No, no news.

227
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:31,390
- Are you, uh, quite sure?

228
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,960
- What the hell business
is it of yours, anyway?

229
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:44,830
- You know, I looked everywhere
for that other glove last night.

230
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,190
But, of course, you detectives are
better trained at finding these things.

231
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,150
- Ah, here we are sir.

232
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,640
- Excuse me, will you?

233
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,240
Thank you.

234
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,630
Oh, they look good.

235
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,780
- They ought to. I've
had 'em for years.

236
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,200
Is it all right sir?

237
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,490
- Yes, I thought the top was
broken, but it's all right.

238
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:08,870
- Have you a light?
- Yes, here you are.

239
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,100
- How silly of me, hadn't noticed it.

240
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,920
- Uh.. all right sir?

241
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,520
- Oh, ha, of course, sorry.

242
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:57,650
Extraordinary actually...
I can't quite...

243
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,590
I say... would you pay for this?

244
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,650
Is this gentleman a
friend of yours, Frank?

245
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,120
Well, we're not exactly
friends. At least not yet.

246
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:38,900
But we're going to do a little
business together, aren't we, Frank?

247
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,980
I'll look after the shop, Father.
You go and finish your paper.

248
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,400
What for?

249
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,750
Oh....all right
my dear, all right.

250
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,440
Rather unfortunate that poor man
died around the corner last night.

251
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:26,650
Look here you....

252
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:38,420
Perhaps it's rather fortunate,
that your little secret only came
into the hands of a man like me.

253
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,710
D'you know, there are some men who
would make money out of a thing like that.

254
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,790
What a chance for blackmail!
Oh, oh that's awful.

255
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,690
I couldn't do a thing like that.

256
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,480
Morning, Miss. Two of each there.

257
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,240
By the way. You're a detective.
Let me give you a tip.

258
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:38,300
Don't wave important clues in telephone
boxes. They've got glass doors.

259
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:45,830
You know, uh, detectives in
glass houses shouldn't wave clues.

260
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:17,120
Come on, out with it. What do you want?

261
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,990
What do I want?

262
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,890
Oooooh, well, uh...

263
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,230
Couldn't we discuss that over breakfast?

264
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:46,280
Mother this is a friend of Frank's. Mr...?

265
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,130
- Tracy.
- Pleased to meet you.

266
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,660
- Mr. Tracy, would you like something to eat?
- Thank-you.

267
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,560
- Lovely weather, we're having.
- Yes, splendid.

268
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:22,610
- Who did you say that man was?
- He's a very important friend of Frank's.

269
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,030
I'll get the breakfast for him.

270
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:30,450
- Here! Aren't we rude?
Won't you take my chair?
- Oh, thanks.

271
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:00,690
- Did you see, or hear
anything during the night?
- No, sir.

272
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,710
- What time did you go to bed?
- About half past ten, sir.

273
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,780
- Did you write this?

274
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,430
- Yes.

275
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,180
- How old would you say this man was.

276
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,440
- I'm afraid I couldn't tell
you, sir, he had his hat on.

277
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,870
- Did you notice anything
particular about his clothes?

278
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:49,820
- Well, uh, he had a black
hat and a loose kind of collar.

279
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,590
'nd a tie and that's about all, I think.

280
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,860
- Was he dark or fair?

281
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,010
- Well, you couldn't say he was a blond
and you couldn't say he was a brunette.

282
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,910
He was a bit of both,
you know, kind of mousey.

283
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,850
- Anything else?
- No.

284
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,440
- Except when he spoke to you,
he went like this.

285
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:21,230
- All right.
Give me records.

286
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,350
- Well, bring him along. Let's
hear what he's got to say.

287
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,610
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

288
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,590
- Right, get along with it..

289
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,140
- That'll do to go on with.

290
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:13,150
- How much longer is that man going to
stay? Don't tell me he'll be here to dinner.

291
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:19,150
- Don't make things awkward mother.
It means a lot to me and Frank.

292
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:23,280
- Well, I don't see why they should
carry on their business in my parlour.

293
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,260
- I'll take it.
- Very well.

294
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:29,130
- But I don't like that man and
the sooner he goes the better.

295
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,880
You are very clever.
I can see that all right.

296
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,300
- Frank? Just a minute, will you?

297
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,580
A pal of yours at the Yard, said
he thought you might be here.

298
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,080
- Oh, all right.

299
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,290
Hello?

300
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,780
Yeah. Yes.

301
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,370
Well, I thought you wouldn't mind if...

302
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,390
What?

303
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,480
Who?

304
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,110
- Any news Frank?

305
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:22,320
- Alice, lock that door.

306
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:56,810
As you were saying... rather
unfortunate the way that poor man
round the corner, uh, died last night.

307
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,760
On the other hand, perhaps it's
fortunate. For us, that is...

308
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:09,320
that a suspicious looking man,
with a criminal record, was seen
hanging around the place.

309
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,540
- You....

310
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:18,570
Look here, don't you try and
swing this thing on me. That
won't get you anywhere.

311
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:31,790
- Also rather unfortunate, that Scotland
Yard, are at present looking for that man.

312
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,680
- I say, Frank!
- Just a minute, Alice.

313
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:52,870
- But there's one thing you
seem to have forgotten....

314
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,190
- And what's that?

315
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:01,270
- Before we get to any hanging,
I shall have quite a lot to say.

316
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:05,210
And the first thing I shall say
is, that she was there too.

317
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,320
- Oh, you will, will you?

318
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:13,440
Isn't there one thing you seem to have
forgotten, that our word's as good as,
or perhaps a bit better...

319
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:16,560
...than that of a jailbird.

320
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,580
So we'll face that when the time comes.

321
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:26,410
Meanwhile, we'll just sit quietly
here until the squad van arrives.

322
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:33,110
- That surprises you doesn't it?
- No, it doesn't surprise me in the least.

323
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:38,230
When it comes, the
surprise won't be for me.

324
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,160
- Very well then, we are both satisfied.
- Yes, we're both satisfied.

325
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,230
It's my word, against hers.

326
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:59,930
- Frank, you can't do this.
- Why not?

327
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:08,580
- Well, because...
- Now, now, don't interfere,
Alice, I know what I'm doing.

328
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,530
You don't, you don't.

329
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,740
- Please, Frank.
- Oh, for God's sake, be quiet, Alice.

330
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:26,320
- Why can't you let her speak.
- You mind your own business.

331
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,400
In any case, she'll speak
at the right moment.

332
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:37,010
- Look here Frank. Why can't we,
both of us, chuck the whole thing now?

333
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:41,720
I've got nothing against you.
You've got nothing against me.

334
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,580
Except, of course, I had some
cash from you, but I wasn't serious.

335
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,140
Well, look here, have it back now.

336
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:08,060
Well, can't you see, that she wants to
chuck it up too? And so do I, you know.

337
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,620
Look here, Miss. You tell him.

338
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,340
Tell him that he's playing
with fire and...

339
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,300
And we shall, all of us,
burn our fingers.

340
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:26,040
I'm not bad really, I only...

341
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:31,740
things have gone wrong lately,
and one's got to live, you know.

342
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,360
All right then. It's still
my word against hers.

343
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,960
That's it?

344
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,040
You men meet me in the
back, Frank, follow me!

345
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:09,260
I say, it's not me you want...
It's him... ask him.

346
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,760
Why his own....

347
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:59,970
Hello. Not very often I see you so
early in the day as this.

348
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,500
- Called to see Frank?
- No.

349
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:08,770
I want to see Inspector Walls, please.

350
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:16,140
- Then you'll have to fill out
one of these forms, you know.
- All right.

351
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:41,650
- Do you know something about this?
- Yes.

352
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:46,950
George. Just a minute.

353
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:55,060
Take this along to inspector Walls.

354
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,380
Well, I suppose you're going
to tell him who did it.

355
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:21,120
Yes.

356
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:29,120
- You can come along now
- Here you are, Miss.

357
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,650
- Come in, please.

358
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,400
Won't you sit down?

359
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:29,180
You've something to
tell us about this case.

360
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:32,990
- Yes.
- Well, what is it?

361
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:39,830
Well, you see. I know who did it.

362
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,890
Is this worthwhile sir, now that
everything has been cleared up?

363
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,460
Yes. But let's hear what
she's got to say.

364
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,880
What I was going to say is this...

365
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,600
I'd better say, what I
have to say now...

366
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:57,570
I would rather not wait.
What I wanted to say is...

367
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:01,260
- I was the one...
- One moment please.

368
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,890
Hello. Yes, yes.

369
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:10,120
Yes, hold on.
Will you deal with this young lady,

370
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,870
I shall be busy for a minute.
- Yes, sir.

371
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,970
This way Miss, please.

372
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:47,570
Alice, whatever made
you come here?

373
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,100
I did it.

374
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:10,010
- I know.
- You don't know.

375
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,020
He tried oh, I can't tell you.

376
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,720
It's too terrible.
I was defending myself.

377
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:23,210
I didn't know what
I was doing and then...

378
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,490
- My dear.

379
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:59,460
- Ha, ha! So you found him,
Miss. Did she tell you who did it?

380
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:02,150
- Yes.

381
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:06,310
You'll want to look out, or you'll
be losing your job, my boy.

382
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:18,090
I suppose we'll soon have lady
detectives up in the Yard, eh.

383
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:23,120
But I shall be all right
on the door, won't I.
