1
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,388
Hello!

2
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:08,809
Hello?

3
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,229
Do you know the road to colbin?

4
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:17,860
I was separated from my
regiment at arshstadt.

5
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,448
Do you have any drinking water?

6
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,826
I'm very thirsty!

7
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,772
Clear water from the mountain.

8
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,425
Thank you, I...

9
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Hello.

10
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,029
I'd like a word with you.

11
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,398
You never said goodbye to me.

12
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,741
In fact, you never
even said hello.

13
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:57,418
It isn't an act of
treason to talk to me.

14
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,795
I'm a weary,
disillusioned soldier.

15
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:01,922
And you're the
only pleasant sight

16
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,966
that I've seen in seven months.

17
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:05,676
Go ahead.

18
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:08,387
It's permitted for you to laugh.

19
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,055
Wait.

20
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,464
You haven't told me your name.

21
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,557
My name's helene.

22
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,352
I want to show you something.

23
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,353
Wait!

24
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,314
Where are you going?

25
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,817
What's wrong?

26
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,247
Rest yourself, young man.

27
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,541
You're safe here.

28
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,335
Here, take this
for your strength.

29
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,133
God knows help is a very
rare thing in this forest.

30
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,781
Take it whenever
it's offered to you.

31
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,487
That bird.

32
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,572
He attacked me.

33
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,407
I'm afraid you're wrong.

34
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,616
She's quite harmless.

35
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,752
Here, hold out your arm.

36
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,673
She only seems dangerous.

37
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,842
Actually, she's
very affectionate,

38
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,262
which is very
unusual for a bird.

39
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,722
Take it back.

40
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,350
Oh, that is too bad.

41
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,852
Little girl liked
him, didn't you?

42
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:47,772
This is Gustav.

43
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,693
He brought you here.

44
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,987
Gustav fed your horse.

45
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,532
Where is helene?

46
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,783
This is helene.

47
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,868
No, not the bird, the girl.

48
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:00,828
Where is the girl?

49
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,163
There is no girl.

50
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,623
Of course there's a girl.

51
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,541
I saw her.

52
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,749
She spoke to me.

53
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,047
Perhaps you were tired
from your long journey,

54
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,091
and had a pleasant illusion.

55
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:22,391
Gustav, have you ever
seen a girl here?

56
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,853
Gustav sometimes
imagines things.

57
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,647
If he could speak,
I think we would

58
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,109
find that his mind is warped.

59
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:37,656
Such is the will of god,
to endow and deprive.

60
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:45,789
The only thing of beauty you'll
find in this forest is helene.

61
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,857
Hello.

62
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,072
I was afraid you'd drowned.

63
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,717
So you are real.

64
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,011
I started to think...

65
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,686
Who are you?

66
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,913
Wait, wait, danger.

67
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:30,889
Quick sand... the girl
was trying to kill me.

68
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,265
She knows not what she does.

69
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,601
Her will is not her own.

70
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,645
You mean she's insane?

71
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,439
Possessed, she needs your help.

72
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,274
Help?

73
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,026
How can I help her?

74
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:47,280
The castle of the baron Von
leppe, you will find her there.

75
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,489
I can say no more.

76
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,908
There's great danger.

77
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,910
Find Eric, Eric knows.

78
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,681
The ride to colbin is
long and far safer by day.

79
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,977
If you leave now, you can
rejoin your regiment by dusk.

80
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,729
Where is Gustav?

81
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,857
What do you want him for?

82
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,465
I want him to show me where the
castle of the baron Von leppe

83
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,737
no one's lived in
the castle for years.

84
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:32,451
And, besides, Gustav has
gone away for a few days.

85
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,955
Perhaps you'd show me
the way to the castle.

86
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,207
Why are you so
interested in the baron?

87
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,460
I never said that I was.

88
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,046
But the girl that I followed
last night and spoke to,

89
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,674
I believe that she lives there.

90
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,344
I told you, there is no girl.

91
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,513
That is nonsense.

92
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,098
You recognize her, don't you?

93
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,156
I'll find the castle myself.

94
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,292
Don't go to the castle.

95
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,002
I have told you the truth.

96
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:24,878
There is no girl.

97
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,366
Mark me, you are
getting yourself

98
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,215
into things beyond
your understanding.

99
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,800
Leave now, while you can.

100
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,303
I intend to find her.

101
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:36,014
Please don't tell the
baron that I am here.

102
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,087
Hello!

103
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,797
Is anyone here?

104
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,179
Hello, it's me, Andre.

105
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,660
In the name of the
government of France,

106
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,703
I order you to open this door!

107
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,001
Your pardon, young sir,
I was at my devotions.

108
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,503
I did not hear you.

109
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,921
I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,258
But surely I made enough
noise to awaken the dead.

111
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,927
The government of France.

112
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:24,099
I've seen the uniforms of
many governments in my time.

113
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,976
What would a soldier of
France be wanting here?

114
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,645
Shelter, for one thing.

115
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:33,858
Permit me to introduce myself,
lieutenant Andre duvalier.

116
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,153
Baron Victor Frederick Von lepp.

117
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,156
I suggest you will find better
shelter at the village inn.

118
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,365
Thank you, baron.

119
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,660
But I've had my fill
of village inns.

120
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,413
Surely, you wouldn't want to
inconvenience a French officer.

121
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:49,707
Come in.

122
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,556
What you see, lieutenant, are
the remains of a noble house...

123
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:10,353
Relics, ghosts of past glories.

124
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,565
A noble heritage is something
to be proud of, baron.

125
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,151
I'm afraid we've
forgotten that in France.

126
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,196
Ah yes, your name,
duvalier, your family...

127
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,366
My father was the
count duvalier... was,

128
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,952
until they spilled his head
into a basket one morning

129
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:27,412
in the place de la concorde.

130
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,999
Forgive me for reviving
painful memories.

131
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,169
You must be cold and
tired, lieutenant.

132
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,420
Some cognac?

133
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,380
I'd like that, baron, thank you.

134
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,923
Sit down.

135
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:45,304
Yes, baron?

136
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,725
Cognac, for our guest.

137
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,144
Yes, baron.

138
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,229
Baron, I wonder
if I might ask, who

139
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,023
was the young woman
I saw in the window

140
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,567
before you came to the door?

141
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,819
Young woman?

142
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,280
Oh, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

143
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,157
No, I'm not mistaken.

144
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:09,078
I saw her, dark hair
and eyes, about 20.

145
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:13,333
Well, I'm quite sure you
think you saw someone.

146
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,125
But...

147
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,587
Baron, I am in full
possession of my faculties.

148
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:21,216
Please, allow me to
show you something.

149
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,267
You should never
believe everything

150
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,395
your eyes tell you, young man.

151
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:38,149
Is that the girl
you think you saw?

152
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:38,817
Yes, of course...

153
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:43,071
Before you say anything,
examine the portrait closely,

154
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,241
the signature... and
above all, the date.

155
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:55,041
1786?

156
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,918
But that's 20 years ago.

157
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:57,669
It's incredible.

158
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,419
It's the same girl.

159
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,130
And she hasn't changed a bit.

160
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,424
She has been dead for 20 years.

161
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,347
With all respect,
baron, for a ghost,

162
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:13,268
she's very active young woman.

163
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,646
You're speaking of the
baroness Von lepp, my wife.

164
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,399
I beg your pardon,
baron, I meant no offense.

165
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,694
Perhaps the resemblance was not
quite as much as I had thought.

166
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,902
The girl at the window...

167
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:28,157
Lieutenant duvalier, the
only occupants of this castle

168
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,452
are Stefan and myself.

169
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,331
You are the first visitor
since the turn of the century.

170
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,332
Of course, baron.

171
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,668
Stefan will see
you to your room.

172
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:39,877
Thank you.

173
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,989
Hello down there!

174
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,282
I'm coming down!

175
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:52,491
Wait for me!

176
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:49,465
Alright, unlock this door.

177
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,467
Do you hear me?

178
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:55,013
Unlock this door or I'm going
to shoot through the door!

179
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:13,126
Ah!

180
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,932
I kept in the shadows, sir.

181
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,933
He did not see me.

182
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,726
He's a strange one, though.

183
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,770
He showed no fear.

184
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:13,980
He must leave at once.

185
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,482
Do you think, perhaps, he
is not merely a traveler?

186
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,775
Why do you say that?

187
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,819
He might have heard
things in the village.

188
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,195
Oh, nonsense, he's a soldier.

189
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,698
He doesn't listen
to old wives' tales.

190
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:28,828
The important thing is that
he leave with all due speed.

191
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,496
I shall see to it, sir.

192
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,872
But of his own accord.

193
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,881
We must show him the
respect that his position

194
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,876
and rank demand.

195
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,795
How quickly.

196
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,004
I understand, sir.

197
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,702
So, must you intrude on the
dead as well as the living?

198
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,662
If I intrude, Stefan,
I shall leave it

199
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,331
to my host to so inform me.

200
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,019
Why have you come
to castle Von leppe?

201
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,959
What do you want here?

202
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,086
You seem to have things
strangely confused

203
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,296
in your mind.

204
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,507
You're the servant, not
I. I'll ask the questions.

205
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,894
This was once a
place of worship.

206
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:37,271
Why have the holy
objects been removed?

207
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,318
The baron ordered it
when his wife passed away.

208
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:43,652
Then this became her tomb?

209
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,696
No, just the entrance to it.

210
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,282
The Von leppe family crypt lies
below, beneath the cemetery.

211
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,493
She rests there with four
centuries of Von leppes.

212
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,290
That's been sealed for 20 years.

213
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,042
Nonsense.

214
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,570
It must have been
open last night.

215
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,962
The girl must have
passed through here.

216
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,931
As the baron told you,
sir, there is no girl.

217
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,591
No girl.

218
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,009
Well, we shall see.

219
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,528
Come with me to
the stable, Stefan.

220
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,887
I wish to attend to my horse.

221
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,722
Wait, lieutenant.

222
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,432
That's what I came to tell you.

223
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,892
Your horse is gone.

224
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,685
Apparently, it bolted
during the night.

225
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,062
Impossible, you're lying.

226
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:18,687
Why?

227
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,148
No, sir, I'm not lying.

228
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:22,858
Hear me well, Stefan.

229
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:26,821
I'm sick of all of these lies...
First the old woman, then

230
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,029
the baron, and now you.

231
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,195
The old woman, you mean...

232
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,281
Never mind.

233
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,909
What about my horse?

234
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,412
I shall get you another one
from the village at once, sir.

235
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,180
Believe me, lieutenant,
I have no desire

236
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,248
to interfere with your
departure from this castle.

237
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,918
You seem very anxious
to be rid of me.

238
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:44,088
Is it because you're afraid
I might find out about Eric?

239
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,804
So there is an Eric?

240
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,014
That at least was not a lie.

241
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,767
Lieutenant, please,
don't involve yourself

242
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,602
in these dead matters.

243
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,939
There is nothing here but an old
man and his decaying memories.

244
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,983
I beg of you,
leave him in peace!

245
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,034
Will you join me, lieutenant?

246
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,744
No thank you, baron.

247
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,455
I've just come from the stables.

248
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:18,706
My horse is gone.

249
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,041
Your horse is gone?

250
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,918
Yes, I believe it
was stolen, baron.

251
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,713
Oh, impossible.

252
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,091
The stable door perhaps was left
open and the animal bolted...

253
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,010
Not an unusual thing.

254
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:34,013
In itself, no, but there
are certain other mysteries

255
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,699
I would like to have
explained, baron.

256
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,808
And I mean to have
them explained.

257
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,102
How dare you take
that tone with me.

258
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,395
I don't know to be abrupt.

259
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:42,604
But I will have answers.

260
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,110
Well...

261
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,072
Now, why did you the portrait
of the baroness from the wall?

262
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,575
I sent it away for renovation.

263
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,619
The... the dampness
of these walls

264
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,204
puts a mold on the pigment.

265
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,164
You evade very cleverly, baron.

266
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,000
Can you also explain the
violin music and the girl

267
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,585
in the chapel last night?

268
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:05,544
You saw her again?

269
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:06,879
So you admit there's a girl?

270
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:07,671
Ilsa.

271
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,964
Ilsa, is that her name?

272
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,173
Answer me, baron.

273
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,610
Please, please,
leave me in peace.

274
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,512
If I leave you now,
baron, I will come back

275
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
with a company of my men.

276
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,890
And I will tear this place
down around your ears

277
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:18,807
until I find her.

278
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,016
Is that clear?

279
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,437
Very clear.

280
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:25,406
All right, now what
happened to the baroness?

281
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,857
Was her death violent?

282
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,609
Yes, her death was violent.

283
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,694
How did she die?

284
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:34,031
Can you spare me nothing?

285
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,868
20 years ago, I was not the
man you're looking at now.

286
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,371
This land, this
estate prospered.

287
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,998
My people live well
and were happy.

288
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,042
My wife had died
some years before.

289
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,669
And I was lonely.

290
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,046
Then one day in
the village, I saw

291
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,633
Ilsa, a peasant girl who'd come
to live there with her mother.

292
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,095
Oh, I could have
taken her as nobles

293
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,138
have taken the
daughters of peasants

294
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,099
since the beginning of time.

295
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:03,060
But I loved her.

296
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:07,481
And she became the
baroness Von leppe.

297
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,025
Almost immediately
afterwards, I was called away

298
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,069
for military
service, a rebellion

299
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:14,655
in the Polish province.

300
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,198
I was gone for nearly a year.

301
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:21,203
When the fighting was over,
I hurried home to my bride.

302
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:26,125
No one knew of my coming.

303
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,668
I surprised her in her room.

304
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,837
She was not alone.

305
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:34,425
She laughed at me, said her bed
was not for me to find another.

306
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:39,138
And with my own
hands, I killed her.

307
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,016
And her lover?

308
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:46,562
Stefan took care of him.

309
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,858
Later, I gave out a story that
she had died of some malaise.

310
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:56,238
No one ever knew of her betrayal
of me, or how, in fact, she did

311
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,032
die.

312
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,576
Except for Stefan.

313
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,370
For 20 years, I've not
set foot beyond the walls

314
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,831
of this castle.

315
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,836
I've lived here alone with the
memory of that dreadful thing

316
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,256
I did that night.

317
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:16,925
That is my penance.

318
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,636
And now you believe what?

319
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,055
That the ghost of Ilsa has
come back to relieve you

320
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,057
of your penance, is that it?

321
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,308
Yes.

322
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,144
How long has the spirit
been coming to the castle?

323
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:31,273
It... it all began two years ago.

324
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:32,650
At first, I was terrified.

325
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:37,571
But now I... I'm eager
for our every meeting.

326
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,823
One more question, baron.

327
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:43,744
Has anyone else except yourself
seen this spirit, Stefan,

328
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:44,952
for instance?

329
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:52,670
You think I'm mad, don't you?

330
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:56,173
Right now, baron, I'm not
sure just what I think.

331
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,509
Ah, but don't forget.

332
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,887
You saw her too.

333
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:03,347
Perhaps we are both mad.

334
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:36,296
Ilsa, Ilsa.

335
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,840
Ilsa?

336
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:41,760
The name sounds strange
to me here by the sea.

337
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,053
It your name.

338
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,848
Don't you remember?

339
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,016
My name is helene.

340
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,518
The old woman told me.

341
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,687
She lies.

342
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,732
She summoned me from the sea.

343
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,483
You must go back.

344
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,861
Your soul is troubled, Ilsa.

345
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,069
Go back?

346
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,447
To Eric?

347
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:05,242
To the sea.

348
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,911
Only when the sea
enters the crypt.

349
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,335
We shall rest there together,
he and I, beneath the sea.

350
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:16,628
It is an evil thing.

351
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:19,214
You must not do it, Ilsa.

352
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:21,425
I must obey the old woman.

353
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:33,437
The frenchman, he
can help you, Ilsa.

354
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:34,645
Andre?

355
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,621
The old one calls.

356
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:58,378
She warned you, Gustav,
do not interfere.

357
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:02,090
She's been patient with you
long enough, but no more.

358
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:04,444
Oh, powers of darkness,
let the spirit of Ilsa

359
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:09,366
sink deeper, deeper
into this mortal fog.

360
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:16,415
Helene, be as though
you never were.

361
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:21,086
Spirit of Ilsa, see
through these eyes.

362
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:22,796
Speak through these lips.

363
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,798
Do my bidding.

364
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:30,762
For only then, shall you find
release from your torment.

365
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:42,316
You are becoming stronger
now, quite strong.

366
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:46,278
Soon you shall have the
strength to carry out

367
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:50,282
my vengeance, vengeance.

368
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,243
And the dark powers
will set you free.

369
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:57,247
For I have promised
them a richer prize.

370
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,727
Good afternoon.

371
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,562
Who are you?

372
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:21,998
An appropriate question, but I'm

373
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,024
afraid I'm the one who
should be doing the asking.

374
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,359
I'm invited in, of course.

375
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,363
What do you want of me?

376
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,907
You realize that this is the
property of the baron Victor

377
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:32,824
Von leppe?

378
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,953
And that it is forbidden
for any of the villagers

379
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,246
to set foot here, much
less make it their home.

380
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,724
How long have you
been living here?

381
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:42,709
Only two months.

382
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,419
Perhaps I should
tell you, you see,

383
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:45,908
I've just come
from kleinschmidt,

384
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,464
where you are not
totally unknown.

385
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,844
You have lived here slightly
more than two years.

386
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:53,804
Your name is katherina.

387
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,114
And you originally
come from colbin,

388
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,574
where you were quite
unpopular because

389
00:41:56,598 --> 00:42:00,185
of, uh, certain activities.

390
00:42:00,394 --> 00:42:03,271
They call you katherina
the heretic, the witch.

391
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,857
They were fools.

392
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:06,775
Why do you live here?

393
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,527
What do you want?

394
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,362
I haven't any money.

395
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,615
This was the only place that
wasn't burned to the ground.

396
00:42:13,824 --> 00:42:16,994
So I... I brought
my things in here.

397
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,454
Where did you find the girl?

398
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,791
There's no girl.

399
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,501
I saw her.

400
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,295
She was sitting in this chair.

401
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,297
There is no girl!

402
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,425
I know what she is.

403
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,303
Old woman, I know what she is!

404
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,389
Listen to me, and listen
to me very carefully.

405
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,237
I don't know what you
want, nor do I fully

406
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,059
understand your black abilities.

407
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,621
But if the two of you have not
returned to colbin within one

408
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:47,607
night, I shall come back and
kill you with my own hands,

409
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:51,611
and burn this place to the
ground once and for all.

410
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,032
Then you know who once lived
here all those years ago?

411
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,662
You know who lived here?

412
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:14,133
Is the frenchman gone?

413
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:15,302
Why not?

414
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,179
He now refuses to leave.

415
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,187
I don't think he will
leave of his own accord.

416
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,432
He must.

417
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,309
I gave you definite orders.

418
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,978
Baron, no one knows
this officer is here.

419
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,189
If he should never
arrive in copeland...

420
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,066
Are you suggesting that...

421
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,942
It's the only way.

422
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,487
That I will never.

423
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,156
God knows I have enough
upon my conscience

424
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,618
without the senseless
murder of a young man who

425
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,619
never harmed me.

426
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,496
How do you know
what harm he plans?

427
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,372
You want him wandering
around the castle?

428
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:45,916
Do you want him
down in the crypt?

429
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,252
Enough, the crypt is
no concern of yours.

430
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,831
Female voice: Andre?

431
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,295
Andre?

432
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:39,839
Help me.

433
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:46,012
Come to me.

434
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:49,516
Come to me, Andre.

435
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,726
I need you.

436
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,729
Where are you?

437
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:42,796
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

438
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,004
I'm sorry, baron.

439
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,965
I thought I heard voices.

440
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:49,969
Does that give you the right to
burst into my room unannounced?

441
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:51,930
I beg your pardon, baron.

442
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:55,892
Stefan has gone to the village
to get you another horse.

443
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:58,395
It will save us both
embarrassment if you will

444
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,480
leave the moment he returns.

445
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,190
There can be no
doubt of it, sir.

446
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,954
Ilsa?

447
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,248
You're doing the best
thing, lieutenant.

448
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,916
The baron often
does things which

449
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,168
may seem strange to you and me.

450
00:49:22,377 --> 00:49:24,796
But the death of the baroness
was a severe shock to him,

451
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,132
one from which I fear he
has never fully recovered.

452
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,842
I understand completely, Stefan.

453
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:40,603
Tell me something, Stefan.

454
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,605
If I can.

455
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:43,814
Who is Eric?

456
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,404
You recall the baron spoke
of returning from the war

457
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,406
and finding the
baroness with another?

458
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,365
Yes.

459
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,075
Eric was that other.

460
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,783
Wait!

461
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,538
Gustav?

462
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:48,166
She has seen you.

463
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,127
She loves you.

464
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,212
You must help her.

465
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:05,258
Tonight, her soul
cries out for release.

466
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:09,103
Go back.

467
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,289
I've waited for you so long.

468
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:13,918
I've been searching
for you to help you,

469
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:20,383
but you wander in strange
places at strange hours.

470
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,386
You're really here.

471
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,387
Of course I'm here.

472
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:28,307
And I'll never leave you again.

473
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,516
Never?

474
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:37,358
When the night
comes, I get cold.

475
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:43,698
My arms and my
shoulders get cold.

476
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:47,285
I don't like the night.

477
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:50,621
I want to be free of it.

478
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,248
You are free.

479
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:57,545
Only in here, in
this holy place.

480
00:54:57,754 --> 00:55:00,173
No, everywhere with me.

481
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,717
You must come away with me now.

482
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:07,972
No, I can't, not until...

483
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,975
Until what?

484
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:13,311
The crypt.

485
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:18,775
It must be destroyed,
and with it the dead.

486
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,401
Don't speak of the dead anymore.

487
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:24,238
You're with me now.

488
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,365
I am possessed of the dead.

489
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:27,694
You're a warm, living woman.

490
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,869
Who has told you these things?

491
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:30,870
The dead.

492
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:33,831
In Paris, they're
doing wonderful things

493
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,460
to discover the
nature of the mind.

494
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,669
I'll take you there.

495
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:41,297
There are doctors who
can free you from this...

496
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,298
From the dead?

497
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:47,470
The dead cannot reach
out from the grave.

498
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,473
You must come away with me now.

499
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:54,101
I'm afraid.

500
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,062
The night.

501
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,147
There's nothing to be afraid of.

502
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:11,953
You see?

503
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:16,332
Love me and there is no fear.

504
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:21,003
Yes, I do love you.

505
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,008
Then come away with me.

506
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,860
Wait here.

507
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,570
It's all right.

508
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:33,529
Ilsa, my love,
you are not alone.

509
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:36,490
I am here with you now.

510
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:40,828
Soon, I will join
you in eternal sleep.

511
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:47,251
Stefan will flood the crypt
and seal us here together

512
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,669
with our love.

513
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,551
Ilsa?

514
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,760
Ilsa?

515
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,141
Ilsa?

516
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,602
Why do you not talk to me?

517
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:10,107
Ilsa: I am here.

518
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:13,486
I've been waiting for you.

519
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,155
My love, my love.

520
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:23,579
Ilsa: You know what you must do.

521
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,539
No, anything I will do.

522
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:27,083
But that, I dare not.

523
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,210
Do not ask me, I beg of you.

524
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:33,380
Ilsa: You must, or we
can never be together.

525
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:34,381
No, no, I cannot.

526
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,468
I dare not.

527
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:38,928
Ilsa: Look at me, Victor.

528
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,649
Why do you torment me so?

529
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,651
You must do it, Victor.

530
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:59,698
Only then can we be
together... only then, Victor.

531
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,617
I cannot.

532
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:03,702
I dare not.

533
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:07,790
My soul will be damned
to eternal perdition.

534
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,750
Let me see who you really are!

535
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:14,588
No, go back!

536
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:15,797
You must not!

537
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:19,718
Let me go!

538
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:22,429
What kind of a woman are you?

539
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:26,308
Where you are you?

540
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:35,818
Who are you?

541
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,239
Helene?

542
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,258
Is there a doctor
in the village?

543
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,719
His illness is not of the flesh.

544
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:02,720
I have seen this before.

545
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,598
In a day or two, his
mind will return.

546
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:07,725
We can only wait.

547
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,453
The baron tells me
you've been with him

548
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,688
since the Polish campaign.

549
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:15,065
That is true,

550
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:17,860
then you must have been in
this castle for 20 years.

551
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,155
You must know every
section of the estate.

552
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,824
He's regaining consciousness.

553
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:27,953
No, he often moans
during these seizures.

554
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,788
You have keys.

555
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,291
Fetch them, I'd like
to see the chapel.

556
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,168
The chapel?

557
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,669
Yes, if you don't mind.

558
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,543
The hinges have rusted solid.

559
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,671
Do you have a crowbar?

560
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:19,879
Yes, come with me.

561
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,309
What is it?

562
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,230
That light there, that's
the baroness's bedroom

563
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,690
in the tower.

564
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,738
The room has been sealed
ever since that night.

565
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,361
Not even the baron would enter.

566
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:43,569
Come with me.

567
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:08,971
Where's the key?

568
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:12,474
Only the baron has
the key to this lock.

569
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:13,726
Lieutenant, don't!

570
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,948
If the baron should find out
we've entered this room...

571
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,794
Did the baroness have a child?

572
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:42,003
I don't know.

573
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,213
I never though she did.

574
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,174
You spare me nothing.

575
01:04:48,135 --> 01:04:50,471
Baron, if you'll permit me,
I think that I can explain.

576
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:52,055
Forgive me, baron.

577
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:53,264
Stefan!

578
01:04:55,184 --> 01:04:57,519
Take this gun.

579
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:00,022
Escort this gentleman
from the castle.

580
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:07,571
If he resists, kill him.

581
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,615
Yes, baron.

582
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,823
Lieutenant.

583
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,929
My love, my love.

584
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,347
Ilsa: I am here, Victor.

585
01:05:39,395 --> 01:05:42,231
I'm weary, Ilsa.

586
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,026
My soul cries out for relief.

587
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:49,863
There is but one way, Victor.

588
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:55,619
No, the holy covenants
of god forbid it.

589
01:05:55,828 --> 01:05:57,955
Ilsa: You will be forgiven.

590
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,832
If I could be sure.

591
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,335
Take your life as you took mine.

592
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:09,925
Let your own hand destroy you
and bring us together forever.

593
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:12,469
Forever.

594
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:15,305
No more torment,
Victor, forever.

595
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:18,891
Forever.

596
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,272
I will, Ilsa.

597
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,775
I will.

598
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:29,862
I promise you, lieutenant, if
you return to Von leppe castle,

599
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,072
I shall not hesitate
to kill you.

600
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:11,612
Where is she?

601
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,405
Let me be.

602
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:16,992
Why did you lie to
me about the girl?

603
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,207
Call it off.

604
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:31,048
It doesn't matter now.

605
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,841
You're too late.

606
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,593
Tonight, he damns himself.

607
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:38,764
Yes, even now she taunts
him to his own eternal doom.

608
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:42,059
You control the girl, just
as you control that bird.

609
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,310
How?

610
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,145
Mesmerism?

611
01:07:45,354 --> 01:07:46,647
Mesmerism, you fool.

612
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:47,940
Why?

613
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,151
Answer me, old woman,
or I'll break your neck.

614
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,363
To avenge myself on
the baron Von leppe.

615
01:07:54,571 --> 01:08:00,160
She will drive him to god's
one unpardonable sin... suicide.

616
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:01,369
For what offense?

617
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,121
What has the baron done to you?

618
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,545
He killed my son, Eric.

619
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,004
Eric was your son?

620
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,131
Yes.

621
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,634
And tonight, the baron
pays for Eric's life

622
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,179
with his own immortal soul!

623
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:23,016
She spoke of
destroying the crypt.

624
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,852
Too late, too late.

625
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,132
Baron!

626
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,467
Baron, you mustn't go... ah!

627
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:18,571
Baron!

628
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:40,217
Where's the baron?

629
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:41,053
We must get to him.

630
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,679
He's locked himself
in the crypt.

631
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:44,681
Eric is avenged.

632
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,266
Eric avenged?

633
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:50,228
She's used the girl as a puppet
to drive the baron to suicide.

634
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,692
She thinks it was the
baron that killed her son.

635
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,232
She never knew it was you.

636
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:55,192
What do you mean?

637
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,194
He killed my Eric!

638
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,196
Eric is her son?

639
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,530
You murdered!

640
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:02,532
No, wait!

641
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:05,118
Don't you see now
it was all a lie?

642
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:08,121
The baron did return that night
to find Eric with the baroness.

643
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,039
And he did kill her.

644
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:10,247
But there was a struggle.

645
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,168
And in the fight, it was not
Eric who died, but the baron!

646
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:15,128
I killed the baron.

647
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:17,631
Then Eric is still alive?

648
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:18,879
He took the baron's place.

649
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:21,093
And for 20 years,
no one has known.

650
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:24,012
But he took the baron's place
in mind as well as body.

651
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:27,307
In his mind, he is
the baron Von leppe.

652
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:31,228
The crypt... she's told
him to flood the cellars.

653
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,438
Now they'll both be killed.

654
01:10:33,647 --> 01:10:34,981
Eric!

655
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,858
Flood the cellars, how?

656
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:40,195
There's a tunnel that leads
from the sea to the crypt.

657
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,404
Come with me.

658
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,215
He's locked it from the inside.

659
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:14,521
You keep on here.

660
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:16,648
I'll try and get in
through the chapel.

661
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,043
I may need you.

662
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:38,670
No, no, not the chapel!

663
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,380
I may not enter
the house of god!

664
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,215
I have made my
pact with another!

665
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:45,384
No closer!

666
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:40,649
I'm here, Ilsa, my
love, this time forever.

667
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,276
Ilsa: Now, Victor, now.

668
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:44,736
I am waiting.

669
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,330
Hurry, Victor, hurry!

670
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:17,394
Ilsa: Now, Victor, bring
the sea into the crypt

671
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:19,479
to mantle us forever.

672
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:42,294
We will be together
again, Victor,

673
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:45,130
together with our love
here beneath the sea.

674
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,969
Come to me, my love.

675
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,305
Draw the veil.

676
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,515
Look at me.

677
01:13:55,724 --> 01:14:01,813
Come see how eagerly
I await your embrace.

678
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,698
What have you done to me?

679
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:14,951
I have damned you
as you damned me.

680
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,621
The part of me that loved
you lies there, Victor,

681
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:20,206
rotting in the coffin.

682
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:21,583
Look at it.

683
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,169
See what your evil
love has done to me.

684
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:27,505
And die with that
vision in your brain.

685
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,382
Why have you done this to me?

686
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:32,302
I am the spirit of Ilsa that
your unholy sin gave over

687
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,013
to the dark powers.

688
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:37,390
But now, by giving your
immortal soul to them,

689
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:41,353
I will be free, Eric.

690
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:08,685
You're safe now.

691
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,857
It's over.

692
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:14,482
It's over.

693
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:15,691
Do you understand?

694
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:19,612
You're free now.

695
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:25,326
Free?

696
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,578
Andre.
