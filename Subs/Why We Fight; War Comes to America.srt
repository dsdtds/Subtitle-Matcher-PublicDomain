followed all Frances in a mail storm of

506
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,239
activity the Maginot Line had already

507
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,610
opened fire on the German the sparring

508
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,609
is in world war has begun

509
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,650
at home we were asked what country do

510
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:13,529
you consider responsible for causing

511
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:15,869
this war Germany 82% we Americans had no

512
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:18,119
doubt who started it all so we began to

513
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,119
fear that this war was going to concern

514
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,829
us President Roosevelt called a special

515
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,160
session of Congress to reconsider the

516
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:29,069
embargo against selling the missions I

517
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:32,489
have asked the Congress to reassemble an

518
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:35,700
extraordinary session in order that it

519
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:38,279
may consider and act on changes in our

520
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,839
neutrality law the men of Congress

521
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,230
wrestled with their beliefs and our

522
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,880
futures they debated and they argued the

523
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:50,460
arms embargo is far too great a security

524
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,090
to American peace to permit its

525
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,300
surrender without a last ditch fight the

526
00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:00,059
Embargo Act because it now stands is

527
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,240
one-sided and works entirely to the

528
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:06,269
advantage of one side therefore the

529
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:08,399
Embargo Act should be modified we the

530
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:11,699
people also debated and argued whether

531
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,380
we should sell arms and munitions when

532
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:15,989
the question was put to us as we had an

533
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:22,070
answer should we change the Neutrality

534
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:24,569
Act so we can sell war supplies yes 57%

535
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:27,710
shortly after our representatives

536
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,710
changed the Neutrality Act

537
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,670
we lifted the embargo on arms and

538
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,710
emissions now we would sell if purchases

539
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,829
would pay and take the stuff away in

540
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:42,710
their own ships American ships were

541
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:47,360
still barred from combat zones meanwhile

542
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,940
on the other side of the globe Japan was

543
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,820
busy trying to bomb shoot and terrorize

544
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:55,490
the Chinese into submission we began to

545
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:58,130
realize that if Japan conquered 400

546
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:59,809
million Chinese she might become so

547
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,110
strong as to run us right out of the

548
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,110
city

[Music]

550
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,679
you will remember that two years earlier

551
00:37:10,048 --> 00:37:15,389
in September 1937 when we were asked in

552
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,548
the present fight between Japan and

553
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:22,739
China are your sympathies with either

554
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:26,670
side only 43% were with China most of us

555
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:31,649
were undecided in June 1939 when we were

556
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:37,230
asked the same question 74% said we were

557
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:39,358
with China now our minds were made up

558
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,030
when we loaded our scrap iron on

559
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,789
Japanese ships our citizens protested

560
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,740
let mister Atchison assist his Secretary

of State chemists the inside of the

562
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:53,279
story so until the middle of 1940 the

563
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,889
restriction of exports to Japan took the

564
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,220
form of moral embargoes of aeroplanes

565
00:37:55,889 --> 00:38:01,519
and direct munitions then Congress

566
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:04,039
passed the Export Control Act and

567
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,509
increasing cut-offs of scrap iron

items follow exports were curtailed to

the limit which those responsible for

571
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:19,230
our defense were willing to risk it was

572
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,660
a fearful responsibility on one side was

573
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,599
the possibility in fact the probability

574
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:28,139
that one day these materials might be

575
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,440
used against us on the other side was

576
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:33,480
the possibility in fact the probability

577
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,119
but to cut them off would provoke an

578
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,750
attack which we were not then prepared

579
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:43,380
to resist finally in the summer of 1941

580
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:45,480
as it became clear that Japan was

581
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,599
turning her back upon every possibility

582
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,119
of reconciliation and adjustment and was

583
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,349
determined upon her great gamble of

584
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,500
conquest all exports ceased on April 9th

585

586

their war machine into high gear

they smashed into Norway on May the 10th

1940 they blitzed into Holland and

672
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:14,840
said keep out we meant it we must

673
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,659
increase production facilities for

674
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:21,260
everything needed for the Army and Navy

675
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:24,519
for national defense I believe that this

676
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:29,660
nation should plan at this time a

677
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:32,900
program that will provide us with 50,000

678

military and naval planes to protect our

679
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,820
shores we authorized construction of a

680
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:40,009
two ocean Navy the greatest of world has

681

ever known at least it would be the

682
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:46,370
greatest Navy when completed in 1944 but

683
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:48,619
then in 1940 it was only a paper Navy

684
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:50,480
our fighting forces at that time

685
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:53,029
consisted of an army of a hundred and

686
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,429
eighty seven thousand men a navy of a

got together and tried to scare us off

war was necessary to ensure access

authority and the funds sufficient to

defending themselves against unprovoked

antagonism to conquerors imposing their

rule on others by force yes partly but

834
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:06,630
principally it was because the American

835
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,730

on the list of free nations to be
