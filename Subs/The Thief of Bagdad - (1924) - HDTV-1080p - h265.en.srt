1
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:45,642
I never know why men come back

2
00:02:45,746 --> 00:02:47,906
From sea

3
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:54,312
The sea is cruel
but the sea is clean

4
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,474
The cause of this vast purity

5
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,640
Must be

6
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,581
That men at sea
are few and far between

7
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,846
Ah, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

8
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:13,147
Ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh-oh

9
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:16,710
Hardship is all she ever gave to me

10
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,720
Oh, oh-oh-oh

11
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:23,380
And yet I ask
why men come back from sea

12
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,888
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

13
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:31,925
The sea is cruel
but the sea is clean

14
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:35,584
Oh, poor brown earth

15
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:38,594
How kind you might have been

16
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,740
The princess -
Have you got news for me?

17
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,004
No, Master.

18
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,508
- Dead?
- She still sleeps.

19
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:45,805
- You followed my orders?
- Yes, Master.

20
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:48,813
- And the blind man?
- He has been found.

21
00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,382
Hmm.

22
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,448
Alms, for the love of Allah.

23
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:56,483
Alms, for the love of Allah.

24
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,515
Alms, for the love of Allah.

25
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,779
Alms, for the love of Allah.

26
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:08,753
What? Your cur would bark?
A fine reward for charity.

27
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:10,820
If charity be false as that coin.

28
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:13,410
Then you cheat, son of a burnt father.

29
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,579
A blind man cannot tell
truth from false.

30
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:18,315
Alas, I cannot tell day from night.
It was my dog.

31
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:22,323
- How can a dog tell bad from good?
- See for yourself.

32
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,618
Now, by the wonder of Allah -

33
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:33,286
It is a false coin,
and I, myself, knew it not!

34
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:37,020
Come, O frequenter of tree trunks...

35
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,590
now which is the bad one?

36
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:51,490
This is no dog, but the reincarnation
of a tax collector!

37
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:27,076
O ye whom Allah gave
the gift of sight...

38
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,334
to fill your eyes
with beauty and delight...

39
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:32,569
spare me a thought
to whom your wondrous world...

40
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:35,201
is but a city of eternal night.

41
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,872
Alms, for the love of Allah.

42
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,878
Alms, for the love of Allah.

43
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,967
- Bring him to me.
- Alms, for the love of Allah.

44
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,113
Alms, for the love of Allah.

45
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,111
Pray for me.
My name is Halima.

46
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:53,445
- I do not know you?
- Does one always know one's friends?

47
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:55,379
I have none to know.

48
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,882
Can you not trust in one
who brings not words, but deeds?

49
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:02,282
In my house, there is food and rest.
And what is mine is yours.

50
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:05,113
- Why should you offer this?
- For your prayers.

51
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,119
That is much for little.

52
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,484
- Take my hand.
- There's no need. My dog sees for me.

53
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,386
He gives me more
than ever he can receive, like all dogs.

54
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:57,166
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge.

55
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:01,258
Only this I know: When the blind
man comes to her, she will be cured.

56
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:06,032
Strange, Master, he can do something
all your powers cannot.

57
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:08,331
I'll make him do it for me
and cast him away.

58
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,735
But she loves the blind man.

59
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,534
Do you call the lisping
of two children in a garden love?

60
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,408
Love she has yet to learn.

61
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:22,973
And I am here to teach her.

62
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:39,908
- Poor blind beggar.
- Even more unfortunate than you know.

63
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:42,537
- That cannot be.
- But we are unveiled.

64
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,310
And I am... veiled.

65
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,540
- Tell us your name.
- Ahmad.

66
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,878
- Ahmad!
- Ahmad, you'll beg no more.

67
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:52,882
- Nor journey on.
- Stay here with us.

68
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:55,885
O sovereigns of silkiness,
I am sure you are beautiful...

69
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:58,044
but for me there is no staying.

70
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,710
I must on, seeking the one I love,
whom I have lost.

71
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,220
Men with two eyes often seek all
their lives and fail to find that one.

72
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:08,948
Stay. There are great doctors here.
They may restore your sight.

73
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,919
That would be the blackest day
of all my days.

74
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,821
- You talk in riddles.
- I will give you the answer. Listen.

75
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:21,020
There was once a king,
son of a king and of a hundred kings.

76
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:23,990
His subjects countless,
his wealth untellable...

77
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,719
his power absolute.

78
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,488
And this dog was not a dog...

79
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:32,754
but a youth who lived in Bagdad
and became dear to the king.

80
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:36,990
But in those days,
he was nothing but a little thief.

81
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,823
Why do you smell my fish,
master of a copper coin? Be off! Be off!

82
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,929
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen? Eh?

83
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,730
Stop, thief!

84
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,001
Stop, thief! Stop that thief!

85
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,016
Hey!

86
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:32,262
Ahmad the king.

87
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:40,022
Son of Akbar,
grandson of Haroun-el-Rachid...

88
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:42,896
the great, the illustrious...

89
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:47,126
lord of the earth,
defender of the faith...

90
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:50,028
servant of the all-highest...

91
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:54,034
but master of all men.

92
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,364
Ahmad the king!

93
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,968
Ahmad the king.

94
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,038
Alas, I was that mighty man.

95
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,336
365 wives were mine.
In my heart there was no love.

96
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,965
Fifty palaces, and I had no home.

97
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:20,702
Richest among my subjects,
I was the poorest of the poor.

98
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:24,244
Every desire satisfied,
I grew empty of desire.

99
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:28,300
And in my whole vast kingdom,
I could find nothing to do -

100
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:31,539
no task, no aim, no purpose -

101
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:35,603
for always my grand vizierJaffar
stood between me and my people.

102
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:03,986
Another execution.

103
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,315
Why had he to die?

104
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,550
He had been thinking,
my lord and master.

105
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:14,023
- Is it a crime then to think?
- In a subject, it's quite unpardonable.

106
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,420
Are men only to be ruled by fear?

107
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:21,824
Men are evil - hatred behind their eyes,
lies on their lips, betrayal in their hearts.

108
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,951
You will learn one day, great king...

109
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:27,323
that there are about three things
that men respect:

110
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,886
the lash that descends, the yoke
that breaks and the sword that slays.

111
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:36,454
By the power and terror of these,
you may conquer the earth.

112
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,532
Do I want to conquer the earth?

113
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:41,065
What do you want,
my lord and master?

114
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,292
I thought I might try
to give them happiness.

115
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,333
Happiness. They are fools and knaves.

116
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:49,995
Your grandsire knew it,
and if you would know it too...

117
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:52,001
do as he did.

118
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,729
One night, when darkness falls...

119
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,825
leave your palace,
go among your people...

120
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:00,564
mix with the crowds,
go into their houses...

121
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,797
listen, observe and remember.

122
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,306
- Tonight, Jaffar.
- Tonight, my king.

123
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,835
- Your people, my king.
- I've never been so close to them.

124
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:26,707
Go. Listen, observe and remember.

125
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:32,572
It is told, though Allah
be wiser or more merciful...

126
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:36,375
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...

127
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:40,348
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.

128
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,849
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...

129
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,678
and the earth was as pitch in the faces
of his subjects and his slaves.

130
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:49,808
- What's he saying?
- And they groaned together in secret.

131
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,683
Why, I don't know.

132
00:14:52,788 --> 00:14:54,912
Is it the king he's talking about?

133
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:58,112
Don't ask questions.
There are spies everywhere.

134
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:00,948
You must be careful in Bagdad.

135
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:05,490
I'm a stranger here. Surely you can tell
me what the old man's talking about.

136
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,557
Oh, about foolish hopes...

137
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,624
about a prophecy,
about a liberator.

138
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:14,022
Only fools and children believe it.

139
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:17,719
A liberator indeed.
Not while Ahmad is king.

140
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:27,323
And they groaned together in secret
and were slain in the marketplace.

141
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,830
But a wise man among the sages of Bagdad
comforted them with a prophecy...

142
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,865
saying, \x22In the fullness of years,
a liberator shall come upon you...

143
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:38,399
\x22and this shall be the sign ofhim:
he shall be the lowest of the low...

144
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,467
and you shall look for him
in the clouds. \x22

145
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,159
And the people cried, \x22We shall
look for him in the clouds indeed...

146
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:46,326
\x22for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...

147
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,697
how can one of no account avail? \x22

148
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:50,859
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...

149
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:53,731
\x22Have faith, trust in Allah...

150
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:56,704
\x22for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...

151
00:15:56,806 --> 00:16:00,829
\x22the lowest of the low,
mounted upon a cloud.

152
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:03,701
\x22But the cloud shall be as strong
as the hills beneath the snow...

153
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:06,137
\x22and from the ranges of the sky...

154
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:09,106
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice. \x22

155
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,698
- What is the name of the tyrant?
- Ahmad.

156
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:13,502
- Ahmad.
- Ahmad.

157
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,507
I wish the miracle would happen today.

158
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,668
I wish he would die today.

159
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,802
Arrest him. Put him in prison.

160
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,505
When he says he's the king,
tell them he's a madman.

161
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:27,239
His friends and all who might be loyal
to him must be destroyed.

162
00:16:28,347 --> 00:16:32,179
I learned that night not that men
are evil, but that he was evil.

163
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,976
When he persuaded me among my people,
he laid a trap for me.

164
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,947
I was thrown into prison...

165
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:42,246
and there, in prison,
my life began...

166
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,875
for there I met the one who was
to become my only true friend -

167
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:50,018
Abu, the little thief of Bagdad.

168
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:53,417
For only very little thieves
are thrown into prison.

169
00:16:53,521 --> 00:16:54,538
No! No! Not in prison!

170
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,213
No! No! Not in prison!

171
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:59,518
- Don't put me in prison! No!
- Come in, thief.

172
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:01,714
Cut off his right arm,
and then his left.

173
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:04,154
Then his left leg, then his right.

174
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:08,190
- And then his head.
- No! No! No! No!

175
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:12,750
I say no! No! Please, no!

176
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,326
Don't kill me!

177
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:17,723
- I don't want to die!
- Tomorrow morning.

178
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:22,856
And as for the madman,
our great sultan Jaffar is merciful.

179
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:24,953
Only his head.

180
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,120
As the sun rises.

181
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:31,187
No! No, no!

182
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,629
No! No, no!

183
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,567
Poor boy, they've driven you mad.

184
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,663
Me mad?

185
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,673
They just said you were mad.

186
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:13,536
Are you really mad?

187
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,611
That's it. I'm mad. I must be mad.

188
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:20,076
The maddest of all the madmen
that ever lived in the sultan's palace.

189
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,503
- You are mad, quite mad.
- What's it matter?

190
00:18:24,614 --> 00:18:29,174
In the morning, unless the sun stops
still and never rises, we both die -

191
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,314
the thief and the madman-
and I don't want to die.

192
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,716
You are not mad...

193
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,250
and maybe we shall watch the sun rise
from over the river.

194
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:43,681
Didn't you hear the jailer?
\x22As the sun rises. \x22

195
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:48,743
As the sun rises, we'll take a boat
and go down to the sea.

196
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:50,752
I've never seen the sea...

197
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:53,788
but I've heard the sailors
on the riverside talk about it.

198
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:57,447
In the sea are fishes
as big as the great temple...

199
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:01,512
and little ones as tiny
as my little finger, with wings.

200
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:05,080
And boats as big as Bagdad itself...

201
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:07,853
with sails as big as clouds.

202
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:11,553
And when the wind blows,
they go as fast as antelopes...

203
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,491
and carry you to the isles
of India and China.

204
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:16,892
To the isles of India and China.

205
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,462
And we're locked in prison.

206
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:21,585
The ax will fall as the sun rises.

207
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,925
And you say you're not mad.

208
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,322
- Look!
- What's that?

209
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,797
The key of the prison.
I just stole it.

210
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,093
- The key? Give it to me!
- Steady, steady.

211
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,394
You want someone to look after you.
We can't go now.

212
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,365
- Why not?
- We must wait. In an hour they will eat.

213
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,764
After they eat, they sleep.
Then we go.

214
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,408
Hurry! Catch this oar.

215
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:07,369
Give me that rope!
Hurry! We must get away.

216
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,603
Do you want us to be killed?

217
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:12,473
Do you think
they will have mercy on us?

218
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,137
Don't you think if the king knew,
he'd be merciful?

219
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:19,177
The king was a fool. I hope he suffers
as much as he made the people suffer.

220
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,940
- Do you hate him so much?
- Everybody hated him.

221
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:25,207
Oh, if I could only
lay my hands on him just once...

222
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:28,109
if I could only tell him
what a fool he was.

223
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:31,580
Tell it now.
I am Ahmad the king.

224
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:37,717
- Speak.
- Ahmad the king is dead.

225
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:41,274
He died yesterday.
There's a new king, Jaffar.

226
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:44,181
Look!

227
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:54,081
Jaffar would not make
all that fuss over me.

228
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,713
He would not send
the whole guard after me.

229
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,517
Mercy, Master. I'm your slave.

230
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:08,557
Leave me at least one arm for small stealing,
and I'll pay you twice as much in taxes.

231
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:11,321
- What's your name?
- I'm Abu the thief...

232
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:14,224
son of Abu the thief,
grandson of Abu the thief.

233
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,262
Most unfortunate of 10 sons
with a hunger that yawns day and night.

234
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,659
Get up, my little friend.

235
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,424
- We must return to Bagdad.
- How can you be such a fool?

236
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,555
I mean, my king would be killed.

237
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,462
A dead king and a dead thief
cannot do much, you know.

238
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:32,965
If your fingers are as nimble as your
brain, you are indeed the prince of thieves.

239
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:36,467
Come on. Let's catch the morning breeze.
That will carry us to freedom.

240
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,195
Freedom. Strange.
I've had everything but freedom.

241
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:41,235
And I've had nothing but freedom.

242
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,530
And now we've got it,
what shall we do with it?

243
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,570
Anything we like.
In three days, we shall be in Basra.

244
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:50,138
Here. Take this pole. Push!

245
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,539
I want to be a sailor

246
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:24,273
Sailing out to sea

247
00:22:24,383 --> 00:22:29,317
No plowboy, tinker, tailor
is any fun to be

248
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,111
Aunts and cousins

249
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,514
By the baker's dozens

250
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:39,814
Drive a man to sea
or highway robbery

251
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:42,284
I want to be a bandit

252
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:44,854
Can't you understand it

253
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:49,047
Sailing to sea is life for me

254
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:53,055
Is life for me

255
00:22:53,157 --> 00:22:55,146
Abu! Basra!

256
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:00,425
Basra.

257
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,325
Basra. How beautiful it looks.

258
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:28,564
How beautiful it smells!

259
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,038
Pancakes!

260
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:05,339
- Give me one!
- Really, you are a fool.

261
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,808
Whoever heard of eating pancakes
without honey?

262
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,811
But how can you steal honey?

263
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:12,379
Allah give us the pancakes,
and he will provide honey.

264
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,345
- Honey! Honey!
- Ah.

265
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:17,708
Honey! Honey!

266
00:24:17,813 --> 00:24:20,473
- You buy honey?
- Yes, we are thinking of buying some.

267
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,241
- Uh, a jar, of course.
- Jar?

268
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:29,142
- Uh, if it's good honey.
- The best in Basra.

269
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:32,445
Uh, easy to say. First I must try.

270
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:55,189
Ahh. I've tasted better.
What do you think?

271
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,519
- No. No, not good enough.
- No.

272
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,855
Your bees are out ofhumor.

273
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,085
Take better care of them.

274
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:13,221
Hey, old friend.
Whose palace is this?

275
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,525
Why, the palace of the sultan,
children of ignorance.

276
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:19,928
- The palace of a thousand toys.
- Toys?

277
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:23,725
Where have you come from,
you beggars of no importance?

278
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,992
Don't you know that the sultan has the
greatest collection of toys in the world?

279
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,160
Why toys?

280
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,724
The sultan is an old man,
and old men are like children.

281
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:35,893
He guards his toys more jealously...

282
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:37,971
than he guards his daughter.

283
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:42,868
But I say no more. Now out of my way,
you masters of a thousand fleas.

284
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:46,669
Allah be with you, but I doubt it.

285
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:31,484
- What's happening?
- Let me go!

286
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:34,179
- Not until you've told us.
- The princess comes!

287
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,913
- Then why does everybody go?
- It's death to look on her.

288
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,486
- Death?
- Why?

289
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:41,578
No man has ever seen her, nor shall,
till her father gives her in marriage.

290
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:44,917
- Is she so ugly?
- Her beauty is like the sun and the moon.

291
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:58,323
Let me go!

292
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:00,155
- Let us go!
- Where?

293
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:02,227
Up there!

294
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,627
Ah.

295
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:32,031
- Your eating will cause our death.
- Without eating, we die.

296
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:46,140
Abu! Here they come!

297
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:12,653
- I must see her again.
- But I've found Sinbad the sailor.

298
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:15,095
And he has given us
two places on his ship.

299
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,791
It is more wonderful
than I'd ever imagined.

300
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:19,924
And on the next tide, she sails.

301
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:23,330
I can't go.
I must see her again.

302
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:27,892
But, Ahmad, all my life I dreamt of
going in a great ship across the world.

303
00:29:28,003 --> 00:29:31,869
I can't go.
I must see her again.

304
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:35,199
If I help you to see her,
will you then come with me?

305
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:36,565
I will.

306
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:03,869
O throbbing heart of mine

307
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:09,380
Be still today

308
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:15,814
We must await the word

309
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:22,285
That all men say

310
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:38,914
And when, O heart of mine

311
00:30:39,022 --> 00:30:44,481
It comes to you

312
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,549
Leap up

313
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,989
Remembering

314
00:30:52,092 --> 00:30:56,118
It might

315
00:30:56,228 --> 00:31:00,786
Be true

316
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:16,932
It might be true

317
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:21,967
No more. The music of a love song
is as heavy as the noonday air.

318
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:24,534
Let us wait for the nightingale
and the night.

319
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:26,603
To the pool.

320
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:38,506
Oh!

321
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,405
A djinni!

322
00:31:46,543 --> 00:31:48,405
A djinni!

323
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:52,773
A djinni. Don't go! Don't go.
It's a djinni in the pool.

324
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:56,605
A djinni.

325
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:15,313
Are you afraid?

326
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:17,749
Yes. Terribly.

327
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,942
Why don't you run away?

328
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,950
I want to look.

329
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:25,452
I've never seen a djinni before.

330
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:28,042
Well, then what do you see?

331
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,781
Remember always, to a djinni,
you must tell the truth.

332
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:33,980
You don't look wicked.
Are you a good djinni?

333
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:38,147
Not too good. Very good djinni
are just as tiresome as very good men.

334
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,554
- Do you live down there?
- No.

335
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,625
- Why have you come?
- To see you.

336
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:48,657
- I was about to bathe.
- I'm waiting.

337
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,317
Bathe, with you there?

338
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,361
Give me your hand then.
Down into the water.

339
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,330
Oh, djinni, you've gone.

340
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:06,330
I didn't mean you to go so soon.

341
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:10,227
Shall I never see you again?
Never?

342
00:33:14,168 --> 00:33:16,396
Don't be afraid.
I'm not a djinni.

343
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:19,836
Who are you?

344
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,929
Your slave.

345
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,202
Where have you come from?

346
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:34,670
From the other side of time...
to find you.

347
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,574
How long have you been searching?

348
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:41,642
Since time began.

349
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,768
Now that you've found me,
how long will you stay?

350
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,774
Till the end of time.

351
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:55,338
For me, there can be no more beauty
in the world but yours.

352
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:58,312
For me, there can be
no more pleasure in the world...

353
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,380
than to please you.

354
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,677
Will you be here in the garden
tomorrow at the same hour?

355
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:32,415
There's a gardener here
who watches night and day.

356
00:34:32,522 --> 00:34:34,489
His name is Death.

357
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,387
You mustn't come.

358
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,457
Forbid me then.

359
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,393
I cannot forbid.

360
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,063
Tomorrow!

361
00:35:04,197 --> 00:35:06,164
And all tomorrows.

362
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:26,462
- Did you see her?
- I did.

363
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:29,469
Good! Then we can go
with Sinbad tonight.

364
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:34,006
- No, Abu. I can't go.
- Why not? You have seen her again.

365
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:37,403
That's why I can't go -
because I have seen her.

366
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:40,601
All right.

367
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:42,677
Then I'll go alone.

368
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:48,902
If you go there tomorrow again...

369
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,409
how will you pass the guards
without me to help?

370
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:54,444
- Oh, I'll find a way.
- You'll be caught.

371
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:04,115
You'll stay with me?
Oh, Abu, why should you?

372
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:06,945
You have as great a longing
in your soul as I have.

373
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,814
- Why should you stay with me?
- Because I'm as great a fool as you are.

374
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:38,624
Brother of lions.

375
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:40,623
Fountain of hospitality.

376
00:36:48,562 --> 00:36:52,360
You know, I have the largest collection
of these mechanical devices...

377
00:36:52,464 --> 00:36:54,589
in the whole wide world.

378
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:57,595
And this is the most remarkable
of them all.

379
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,388
I-It tells the time.

380
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:03,897
See how it works? Huh?

381
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,899
Sheer magic, isn't it?

382
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:09,662
I hope this dangerous device will never
be allowed into the hands of the people.

383
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:11,666
- Dangerous?
- Yes.

384
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:14,065
If people once begin
to know the time...

385
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:16,499
they will no longer call you
the king of time.

386
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:18,727
They will want to know
how time is spent.

387
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,327
Oh, you're right.
Oh, the people must never know.

388
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,336
Look, look. Come.

389
00:37:24,438 --> 00:37:27,565
Ah! See.
Such workmanship.

390
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:33,471
Such - Such precision.
Such reliability.

391
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:36,370
I do so prefer these things
to my subjects.

392
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:38,840
Watch. Watch.

393
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:43,740
See. No, no.
That's the finest of them all.

394
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,011
See?

395
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:53,211
I have only to wind a
key or press a spring -

396
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,873
and they do exactly
the same thing every time...

397
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,947
and exactly what I want.

398
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,807
And so often my subjects
fail to do exactly what I want...

399
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,907
and then I have to have
their heads cut off.

400
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:10,484
See? Oh!

401
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:13,279
Your collection
is indeed magnificent...

402
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:15,546
and so near completion too.

403
00:38:15,653 --> 00:38:17,280
Near completion? Huh.

404
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:21,377
I'd have you know my collection
is-is the most complete completion.

405
00:38:21,489 --> 00:38:23,511
Please, do not misunderstand me.

406
00:38:23,622 --> 00:38:27,144
I am well aware that nothing short
of a miracle could add luster...

407
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:30,155
to this already dazzling display.

408
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:33,884
But such a miracle does exist.

409
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,788
A mechanical toy better than -
than any of mine?

410
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:41,916
Knowing of your interest in these
matters, I have brought it with me.

411
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,027
Well, let's see it. Let's see it.
Quickly, quickly!

412
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:46,493
Oh, I can't bear to be kept waiting.

413
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,361
Ooh. This is exciting, this.

414
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,335
If Your Highness
would wind it yourself.

415
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,271
Uh -

416
00:39:32,274 --> 00:39:34,435
Oh! What's it going to do? Hmm?

417
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:37,373
Move its legs, or arch its neck?

418
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,534
Or-Or wag its tail? Hmm?

419
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,611
It doesn't kick, does it?

420
00:39:42,712 --> 00:39:45,575
To tell you the truth, I'm always
rather nervous of these things...

421
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,009
till I know what they're going to do,
till I get used to them.

422
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:50,635
Ooh. Ah.

423
00:39:53,948 --> 00:39:55,845
It wants some winding.

424
00:39:56,949 --> 00:39:59,575
- If Your Highness would mount.
- Yes.

425
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:12,317
- And now?
- Pull the reins!

426
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:40,506
Marvelous!
I am no longer a man. I am a bird!

427
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:43,544
I'm the king of birds!

428
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,938
Oh.

429
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,104
No! Oh. Mmm, I want it!

430
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:56,648
I want it. I must have it, and I'll
give you anything you wish for it.

431
00:41:56,749 --> 00:42:00,912
It's yours.
I ask but one thing in return.

432
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,916
Anything you will.

433
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:07,384
- Your daughter.
- My daughter?

434
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,076
Mm-hmm.

435
00:42:09,187 --> 00:42:13,484
Oh, dear, dear, dear. Really.
This is - This is very awkward.

436
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:15,679
Wh - What do you want
my daughter for?

437
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:19,084
- I have to found a dynasty.
- Oh, quite, quite, quite.

438
00:42:19,189 --> 00:42:21,986
I understand entirely
about founding a dynasty.

439
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,957
Delightful thing to do.
I've tried myself, many times.

440
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:28,048
And what have I got?
A daughter.

441
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:31,557
The true offspring
of the mother of miseries.

442
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,524
Her eyes have quarreled. They're
always trying to get at one another.

443
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:37,287
Her eyes are Babylonian eyes...

444
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:41,691
and her eyebrows like
the crescent moon of Ramadan.

445
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:45,354
- Her body's straight as the letter alif.
- How do you know?

446
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,431
- I've seen her.
- Oh, no, you -

447
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,123
- I have.
- Where?

448
00:42:50,232 --> 00:42:53,289
- In my crystal.
- Oh, confound your crystal.

449
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,855
Confound all crystals.
I always did hate the things. I -

450
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,831
- Are you a magician?
- I have some skill.

451
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,902
Oh, say no more. I -

452
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:09,765
Anyhow, I - I must have this horse.
So I suppose you must have my daughter.

453
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,768
Mmm.

454
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:18,170
I will never marry him.
I would rather die.

455
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:21,362
I will go to my sister, who's married
to he sultan of Samarkand.

456
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,839
She will protect me.

457
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:28,807
Go back to the garden. You will find someone
there whom we thought was the djinni of the pool.

458
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,238
Tell him of our misfortune, and tell him
that I will wait for him in Samarkand.

459
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:34,243
Yes, Princess.

460
00:44:08,653 --> 00:44:11,347
Your Highness,
the princess is nowhere to be found.

461
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,920
She is gone. We have searched
the whole garden.

462
00:44:14,022 --> 00:44:16,080
- We have found only two beggars.
- Bring them here.

463
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,954
Jaffar! Jaffar!

464
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,959
Jaffar!

465
00:44:39,863 --> 00:44:44,762
At last, face to face,
man to man, sword to sword.

466
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:47,456
Give me a sword!
Allah will judge!

467
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:50,622
Great sultan, I speak the truth.
My eyes bear witness.

468
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,825
Ahmad!

469
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:22,103
My eyes!

470
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:25,106
I'm blind!

471
00:45:25,207 --> 00:45:27,504
Ahmad!

472
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:29,940
Listen, great sultan,
I know the truth.

473
00:45:30,044 --> 00:45:32,566
You must know who this man is!

474
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:34,768
And this - Listen, good people.

475
00:45:34,878 --> 00:45:38,710
- Son of a dog.
- Allah.

476
00:45:38,813 --> 00:45:42,837
By this, my magic rune...

477
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:45,573
be what your fathers were...

478
00:45:46,948 --> 00:45:49,210
and bay the moon.

479
00:46:08,822 --> 00:46:11,014
And this is my curse:

480
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:14,023
You shall remain a dog...

481
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,947
and you shall walk
in the darkness of the blind...

482
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:24,152
until I hold her in my arms.

483
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:31,520
And now, dispensers of bounty,
you know why a blind man with his dog...

484
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:36,061
searches the world for a lost love,
and with little enough hope.

485
00:46:36,162 --> 00:46:39,029
Yet without that hope,
there would be nothing.

486
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,962
And Allah is merciful.

487
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:45,498
Allah is merciful indeed,
for the one that you seek is here.

488
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:47,689
If you mock me,
Allah will not forgive.

489
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:51,926
I do not mock. Your princess was captured by
slave traders and sold here in our slave market.

490
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:54,398
The richest merchant in the town
bought her.

491
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:57,899
But no sooner was she taken to his house
than she fell into the strangest trance.

492
00:46:58,001 --> 00:47:01,231
She lives, but is as dead.
No doctor can restore her.

493
00:47:01,336 --> 00:47:03,859
Night and day she calls upon
the djinni of the pool.

494
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,995
- I was that djinni!
- And you alone can bring her back to life.

495
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:10,230
Can you take me where she is?

496
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:39,343
O djinni, shall I never see you again?

497
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:43,112
- Never?
- Lead me to her.

498
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,118
Why have you come?

499
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,217
To find you.

500
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,150
- How long have you been searching?
- From the beginning of time.

501
00:48:06,055 --> 00:48:09,581
Now that you've found me,
how long will you stay?

502
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,679
Till the end of time.

503
00:48:14,023 --> 00:48:17,047
The dream - my dream -

504
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:21,918
always the same dream.

505
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:23,993
This is no dream.

506
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:35,361
Ahmad!

507
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:47,434
Finish the masquerade.

508
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:54,900
Don't look at me like that.

509
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:56,968
Suffering has left its mark.

510
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:03,233
For me, your beauty
will always be as I first saw it -

511
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,600
never changing.

512
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:09,502
Your eyes - They're so strange.

513
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:11,938
So full of pain.

514
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:14,872
One cannot go through fire
and not be scorched.

515
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:19,639
Ahmad, you must go.
The master has returned.

516
00:49:19,742 --> 00:49:22,835
I will hide you, and when the master
sleeps in the heat of the noon...

517
00:49:22,945 --> 00:49:25,275
I'll bring her to you.

518
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:31,443
Quiet.

519
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:42,280
From now you're not only mine.
You belong to the princess as well.

520
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,576
Stay and guard her for me.

521
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:03,114
Blind. He's blind.

522
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:05,620
It is in your power
to restore his sight.

523
00:50:05,723 --> 00:50:09,678
There is, in this town, a famous doctor
who would, at your request, cure him.

524
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:12,856
Take me.

525
00:50:20,626 --> 00:50:23,616
Is the doctor here, on this ship?

526
00:50:23,726 --> 00:50:26,853
Yes. He's waiting for you.

527
00:51:17,043 --> 00:51:19,704
Open this door.

528
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:21,709
Open it!

529
00:51:44,484 --> 00:51:46,814
Bring him nearer.

530
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:50,917
Nearer.

531
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,920
How do you find
your dog's life, hmm?

532
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:04,188
Mmm. Strange how an unpleasant child
can be a decent dog.

533
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,752
Throw him overboard.

534
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,395
Welcome.

535
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:35,190
- Jaffar!
- Yes. Jaffar.

536
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:37,389
It's always Jaffar.

537
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:40,397
Since you left your palace,
I have kept you safe.

538
00:52:41,933 --> 00:52:46,028
When you rode hopeless and lost
in the desert, who guided you?

539
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:50,829
When you were sold in the slave market,
who bought you?

540
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:53,060
Always Jaffar.

541
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:57,101
It was in my house you were cared for,
to sleep your sleep...

542
00:52:57,204 --> 00:52:59,397
and dream to its end...

543
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:02,132
your first dream of love.

544
00:53:03,273 --> 00:53:06,263
It was I who woke you.

545
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:09,272
No. It was Ahmad.

546
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:13,234
I was told there was a doctor here...

547
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:15,672
who could restore his sight.

548
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:22,578
But I am that doctor.

549
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:43,284
The same moment
that I hold you in my arms...

550
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,351
Ahmad will see.

551
00:53:50,188 --> 00:53:52,552
Take me in your arms.

552
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:02,156
My eyes!

553
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:46,631
Hey! Ahmad!

554
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:48,634
Ahmad!

555
00:54:48,736 --> 00:54:51,965
Can you see?
I'm Abu again!

556
00:54:52,072 --> 00:54:54,038
Abu!

557
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,030
- Abu, where is she?
- She's with him - Jaffar-on the ship.

558
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:08,040
What good are my eyes to me
without her?

559
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:21,779
Is there nothing for you
without her?

560
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,847
Nothing.

561
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:41,261
No. No.

562
00:56:42,735 --> 00:56:45,793
I have powers that could
force you to my will.

563
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:52,970
But I want more than they can give.

564
00:56:53,073 --> 00:56:55,039
I want your love.

565
00:56:56,674 --> 00:57:00,129
Forget Ahmad.
He's no longer blind.

566
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:04,333
And for a man with eyes,
the world is full of women.

567
00:57:05,643 --> 00:57:08,007
Only I am cursed...

568
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,373
that I can see only you.

569
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,843
Little fool. Trying to end your life
before it has begun.

570
00:57:22,947 --> 00:57:25,846
I tell you, Ahmad has forgotten.

571
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:27,846
Look!

572
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:29,915
It's Ahmad!

573
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:39,781
Wind!

574
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:43,449
Wind!

575
00:57:43,555 --> 00:57:45,350
Wind!

576
00:58:14,628 --> 00:58:17,323
Whip yourself, winds of heaven!

577
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:20,022
Whip till you wail aloud!

578
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:53,372
Ahmad!

579
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,296
Ahmad!

580
01:00:17,331 --> 01:00:19,593
Ahmad!

581
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:39,030
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny?

582
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:41,071
You behave like a slave girl.

583
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,194
I am a slave girl.

584
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:45,202
You could command me.

585
01:00:45,304 --> 01:00:48,034
Try. Ask what you will.

586
01:00:49,075 --> 01:00:52,472
Would you take me back to Basra?

587
01:00:52,575 --> 01:00:55,040
- Helmsman!
- Master!

588
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:57,573
Northward to Basra.

589
01:01:24,016 --> 01:01:27,914
This is a place of desolation.

590
01:01:28,016 --> 01:01:31,315
It is the most beautiful garden
in the world.

591
01:01:31,419 --> 01:01:35,580
If there were ever flowers in it,
they've vanished, like cancer.

592
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:39,451
And the pool - so dark with weeds...

593
01:01:39,554 --> 01:01:42,544
you can't even see
your own reflection in it.

594
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:45,486
I'm not looking for my own reflection.

595
01:01:47,523 --> 01:01:50,547
Father, I don't want to
go to Bagdad with Jaffar.

596
01:01:50,657 --> 01:01:53,680
- But, my dear-
- Don't let him take me.

597
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:57,726
- Don't!
- Oh, there, there, there, there, there, there.

598
01:01:57,827 --> 01:02:01,259
Well, if you don't want to
go to Bagdad with him, you shan't.

599
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,556
No. Never. Never, never, never.
Never while I live. There.

600
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:08,957
There. Oh.

601
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,921
What is it?

602
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:42,079
The newest magical toy:
the silver maid.

603
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:48,430
Does she do anything more?

604
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:50,939
She can embrace you.

605
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:53,202
But any of my wives will do that.

606
01:04:54,543 --> 01:04:57,407
Her embrace will thrill you...

607
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:00,409
as no other woman ever has...

608
01:05:00,512 --> 01:05:02,479
or ever will.

609
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:06,377
Do you mean I might
get rid of all my wives...

610
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:08,504
and have a collection
of these things?

611
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:24,813
She tickles!

612
01:05:57,228 --> 01:05:59,195
Guards!

613
01:06:01,327 --> 01:06:03,227
Make ready for Bagdad.

614
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:34,134
Free! Free!

615
01:06:34,238 --> 01:06:38,899
Free! Free! Free!

616
01:06:39,006 --> 01:06:43,337
Free! Free! Free!

617
01:07:04,045 --> 01:07:05,944
Free again!

618
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:09,776
Free, after 2,000 years!

619
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:14,146
2,000 years ago, King Solomon,
master of all the djinns...

620
01:07:14,251 --> 01:07:16,512
imprisoned me within that bottle.

621
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,417
For me, this is the first moment
of my new freedom.

622
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:27,179
For you -

623
01:07:27,286 --> 01:07:30,981
For you,
this is the last moment of your life.

624
01:07:31,087 --> 01:07:32,486
My life?

625
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:33,680
Your life!

626
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:36,256
In a moment I shall
lift my foot and crush you...

627
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:39,187
insect, beetle, worm that you are!

628
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,552
But, sheik of spirits,
I fished you out of the sea.

629
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:45,421
I opened your bottle. I let you out.
You can't be so ungrateful.

630
01:07:45,526 --> 01:07:47,788
Ungrateful?
Slaves are not grateful.

631
01:07:47,892 --> 01:07:51,486
Not for their freedom.

632
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:53,493
Listen.

633
01:07:53,595 --> 01:07:55,561
Inside my bottle
for the first thousand years...

634
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:59,458
I swore that I'd enrich the one that
freed me with all the riches of the earth.

635
01:07:59,562 --> 01:08:02,654
But in the second thousand years, my
imprisoned spirit turned to vengeance...

636
01:08:02,763 --> 01:08:05,594
on all that lived and were free.

637
01:08:05,698 --> 01:08:09,288
And I swore that I'd kill him
that freed me to satisfy that hate.

638
01:08:09,397 --> 01:08:11,297
Are you ready?

639
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,265
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

640
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:21,096
Please, before I die, may I -

641
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:26,998
May I ask one question?

642
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,297
Ask.

643
01:08:35,306 --> 01:08:38,103
How comes it that you,
as big as a mountain...

644
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:42,140
could ever get into that bottle
I can hold in my hand?

645
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,606
You weren't ever in it really,
were you?

646
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:46,697
- Of course I was.
- Oh, no, you weren't.

647
01:08:46,808 --> 01:08:48,833
- I was!
- You weren't!

648
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:50,841
What? You dare doubt?

649
01:08:50,943 --> 01:08:55,538
If I'm going to die in a moment, I can
dare anything, and I say it's impossible.

650
01:08:55,647 --> 01:08:57,272
- Impossible?
- And I don't believe you.

651
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,005
- Take care.
- And never shall.

652
01:08:59,113 --> 01:09:00,942
- Never?
- Nothing can make me!

653
01:09:01,046 --> 01:09:04,946
- Nothing?
- Nothing. Unless I see it with my own eyes.

654
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:06,981
Then, dog of an unbeliever,
before you die...

655
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:09,105
you shall see, with me,
nothing is impossible!

656
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:13,671
You shall see and believe!

657
01:09:34,823 --> 01:09:37,415
Now, you great, overblown belch!

658
01:09:37,523 --> 01:09:39,423
Let me out! Let me out!

659
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:42,389
Just because you were bigger than me,
you thought you could bully.

660
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:45,287
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Product of inflation.

661
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:49,792
Descendant of a stink. Let you out?

662
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,128
I'm going to throw
you back into the sea.

663
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:57,184
- This time forever.
- Oh, no. Mercy! Mercy, O Master!

664
01:09:57,295 --> 01:09:59,231
- What's that?
- O great and merciful master!

665
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,762
- Say that again.
- O great and merciful master...

666
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,227
let me out,
and I'll grant you three wishes.

667
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:06,854
- Three wishes?
- Your first three wishes shall come true.

668
01:10:06,965 --> 01:10:08,864
- You swear?
- I swear.

669
01:10:08,967 --> 01:10:11,365
By King Solomon,
master of all the djinn?

670
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:14,262
By King Solomon,
the master of all the djinn...

671
01:10:14,366 --> 01:10:16,264
the oath that no spirit can break.

672
01:10:16,366 --> 01:10:19,495
- And you'll behave? No threatening and shouting?
- No.

673
01:10:19,603 --> 01:10:21,502
- No what?
- No, Master.

674
01:10:21,604 --> 01:10:25,503
Now, don't make so much noise again.
You frightened me before.

675
01:10:44,776 --> 01:10:48,300
Master, I hear and obey.

676
01:10:50,178 --> 01:10:54,576
That's better. All bullies
must learn manners in the end.

677
01:10:54,678 --> 01:10:57,110
I'm hungry.

678
01:10:57,213 --> 01:10:59,339
Can't think with my stomach empty.

679
01:11:03,316 --> 01:11:06,543
I wish I had some of those sausages
Mother used to make.

680
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:16,149
Your sausages, Master.

681
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,584
That was the first wish, Master.

682
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:49,183
Two more remain.
Name them.

683
01:11:49,294 --> 01:11:51,852
Don't you hurry me.
I've got to be careful.

684
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:55,419
Two more.
You know what I wish?

685
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,428
Tell me. Where is my friend Ahmad?

686
01:11:57,529 --> 01:12:00,362
Master, to know that,
you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.

687
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:03,090
- Then give me the eye.
- Master, I can take you where it is...

688
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:05,167
but not even I can steal it for you.

689
01:12:05,268 --> 01:12:07,495
Steal? Huh!
I'll see to that.

690
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:10,123
- Little braggart. What have you ever stolen?
- What haven't I?

691
01:12:10,233 --> 01:12:13,860
A key from its lock, ring from its finger,
money from its purse, the strength of a djinni -

692
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:17,697
And the tongue of a liar! But he who
would steal the All-Seeing Eye...

693
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:21,963
from the very brow of the goddess must be
neither a thief nor a braggart, but a hero.

694
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:24,696
I always wanted to be a hero.
Come on!

695
01:12:26,772 --> 01:12:28,704
Then catch on to my hair.

696
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:32,239
All right. But mind you, this
is not my second wish yet.

697
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:34,898
Now I'm rather helping you.

698
01:12:36,273 --> 01:12:37,764
Yes, Master.

699
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:50,140
Djinni! Djinni!

700
01:12:50,247 --> 01:12:52,178
I'm frightened!

701
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:56,144
I hear!

702
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:17,551
All right, Master?

703
01:13:17,652 --> 01:13:21,051
I think so.
Where are we now?

704
01:13:21,153 --> 01:13:23,211
Above the roof of the world.

705
01:13:23,321 --> 01:13:24,843
Has the world got a roof?

706
01:13:24,954 --> 01:13:27,615
Of course, supported by seven pillars.

707
01:13:27,722 --> 01:13:31,782
And the seven pillars are set on the shoulders
of a djinni whose strength is beyond thought.

708
01:13:31,892 --> 01:13:33,916
And the djinni stands on an eagle...

709
01:13:34,025 --> 01:13:36,856
and the eagle on a bull,
and the bull on a fish.

710
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:40,083
And the fish swims
in the Sea of Eternity.

711
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,688
Where are we going?

712
01:13:56,798 --> 01:14:00,231
On the highest peak
of the highest mountain of the world...

713
01:14:00,332 --> 01:14:04,627
where earth meets the sky,
and there is the Temple of the Dawn.

714
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:07,858
And in the great hall of the temple
is the goddess of light.

715
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:11,765
And in the head of the goddess
is the All-Seeing Eye.

716
01:14:40,111 --> 01:14:42,042
And now, my little braggart...

717
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:46,100
you can be a thief
and a hero all in one.

718
01:16:01,768 --> 01:16:06,463
A hero.

719
01:18:07,769 --> 01:18:10,234
I want to be a sailor

720
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:12,393
I want

721
01:18:12,503 --> 01:18:14,664
- I want
- I want

722
01:18:14,772 --> 01:18:19,329
- I want to be a sailor
- I want to be a sailor

723
01:18:26,943 --> 01:18:32,534
I want to be a sailor,
sailing out to sea

724
01:18:32,643 --> 01:18:37,543
No plowboy, tinker, tailor
is any fun to be

725
01:18:37,643 --> 01:18:41,509
Aunts and cousins

726
01:18:41,611 --> 01:18:44,600
- By the baker's dozens
- By the baker's dozens

727
01:18:44,712 --> 01:18:49,478
Drive a man to sea
or highway robbery

728
01:18:49,581 --> 01:18:52,549
- I
- I

729
01:18:53,581 --> 01:18:58,949
Want to be a bandit
Can't you understand it

730
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,243
Can't you understand it

731
01:24:14,175 --> 01:24:17,833
Djinni! Djinni!
Get me out ofhere, quick! Quick!

732
01:24:17,941 --> 01:24:22,170
Djinni! Djinni! Help! Help!
Djinni, help!

733
01:24:22,276 --> 01:24:24,242
Djinni!

734
01:24:28,244 --> 01:24:29,972
Is this the All-Seeing Eye?

735
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:32,670
Not for 2,000 years
will she grow another.

736
01:24:32,778 --> 01:24:35,803
For a hundred generations of men,
she will not know their doings.

737
01:24:35,914 --> 01:24:39,141
- Now shall I know what happened to Ahmad?
- Look.

738
01:24:39,247 --> 01:24:40,906
Look hard.

739
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:51,374
It's true. It's Ahmad.

740
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:55,350
Help!

741
01:24:55,452 --> 01:24:58,044
Help!

742
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:24,191
Help!

743
01:25:25,894 --> 01:25:29,919
- Help!
- Help!

744
01:25:32,596 --> 01:25:34,755
Now my second wish.
Take me to him.

745
01:25:34,862 --> 01:25:37,261
To hear is to obey,
little master of the world.

746
01:25:39,598 --> 01:25:43,997
Hold tight, little brother.
We have to return half across the world.

747
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,845
Don't be afraid, Ahmad!

748
01:26:33,948 --> 01:26:37,073
- It's me, Abu!
- Abu!

749
01:26:37,181 --> 01:26:39,408
Put me down!
Put me down!

750
01:26:41,783 --> 01:26:45,943
Gently, you clumsy good-for-nothing!

751
01:26:48,817 --> 01:26:50,783
- Abu!
- Ahmad!

752
01:26:51,817 --> 01:26:54,445
Allah be merciful.
It's a real djinni.

753
01:26:54,553 --> 01:26:57,610
Yes. He's mine,
and I am his master.

754
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:10,422
I am your master, aren't I?

755
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:12,785
To hear is to obey, O Master!

756
01:27:12,889 --> 01:27:16,415
See? He brought me here,
and he'll carry us away.

757
01:27:26,294 --> 01:27:29,590
What's he laughing like that for?
I don't like the sound of it.

758
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:33,094
Oh, he's all right.
He's a bit big to talk to.

759
01:27:33,196 --> 01:27:35,958
That's the worse part about him.
You have to shout so much.

760
01:27:36,064 --> 01:27:38,361
Hey, you up there!

761
01:27:38,465 --> 01:27:42,363
- What are you laughing for?
- For my freedom. It is at hand.

762
01:27:42,465 --> 01:27:44,796
You get us out of this place.

763
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,265
- Your third wish?
- No, no, no, no.

764
01:27:47,368 --> 01:27:49,300
Not yet.

765
01:27:49,401 --> 01:27:52,299
He is big, but he is sharp.

766
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:55,528
I've got to be careful.
Only one wish left.

767
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:00,570
I have only one wish.

768
01:28:00,671 --> 01:28:03,569
Oh, I know all about that.

769
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:05,467
Your princess.

770
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,630
If only I could see her again.

771
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:11,401
Is that all?
I don't need to waste a wish for that.

772
01:28:11,508 --> 01:28:13,633
- Look.
- What's that?

773
01:28:13,741 --> 01:28:15,798
Look into it - hard, hard.

774
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:20,203
Keep staring into it.
You'll see her.

775
01:28:26,345 --> 01:28:28,472
It's true!

776
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:45,906
A blue rose?

777
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:49,145
I've heard about that.

778
01:28:49,253 --> 01:28:53,208
That -
That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness.

779
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,717
If she inhales its fragrance,
she'll forget... everything.

780
01:29:03,956 --> 01:29:05,888
Blue roses?

781
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:28,292
Exquisite.

782
01:29:42,533 --> 01:29:44,434
Who are you?

783
01:29:46,534 --> 01:29:48,694
I don't know.

784
01:29:48,801 --> 01:29:50,769
I've forgotten.

785
01:29:52,271 --> 01:29:54,238
Why have you suffered?

786
01:29:55,904 --> 01:29:58,268
Have I suffered?

787
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:00,338
I don't remember.

788
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:03,406
It seems I was in love.

789
01:30:04,473 --> 01:30:06,463
Whom did you love?

790
01:30:08,941 --> 01:30:11,601
I cannot tell.

791
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:13,937
I don't know any longer.

792
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,009
I can't look anymore!

793
01:30:17,143 --> 01:30:19,042
There are worse things than blindness.

794
01:30:19,144 --> 01:30:22,701
Knowledge can be more terrible
than ignorance, if one can do nothing.

795
01:30:23,878 --> 01:30:27,276
Nothing.
Why did you give me this?

796
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,939
Take it back and break it
into a thousand pieces.

797
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:33,275
I only stole it to help you.

798
01:30:33,381 --> 01:30:35,872
You stole it
because you enjoy stealing.

799
01:30:35,981 --> 01:30:38,278
Without my stealing, you'd be dead.

800
01:30:38,383 --> 01:30:42,249
I wish I were dead.
I wish I'd never seen you.

801
01:30:42,349 --> 01:30:44,749
I wish -
I wish I were in Bagdad.

802
01:30:44,852 --> 01:30:46,819
I wish you were!

803
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,077
Ahmad! Ahmad!

804
01:30:51,187 --> 01:30:53,915
Ahmad! Ahmad!

805
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,011
Ahmad!

806
01:30:57,122 --> 01:30:59,021
Ahmad!

807
01:30:59,122 --> 01:31:01,021
Where are you?

808
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,952
Where you wished him -
on his way to Bagdad.

809
01:31:03,056 --> 01:31:06,546
Then take me out of this place.
Don't you hear? I want to get out.

810
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:08,558
You stay where you are.

811
01:31:08,659 --> 01:31:11,148
You're a clever little man,
little master of the universe...

812
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:13,487
but mortals are weak and frail.

813
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:16,583
If their stomach speaks,
they forget their brain.

814
01:31:16,694 --> 01:31:19,388
If their brain speaks,
they forget their hearts.

815
01:31:19,496 --> 01:31:24,155
And if their hearts speak-

816
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:27,627
If their hearts speak,
they forget everything!

817
01:31:27,729 --> 01:31:29,526
Am I not your master?

818
01:31:29,632 --> 01:31:33,427
No longer. You've had your
three wishes, and I am free!

819
01:31:33,532 --> 01:31:35,431
Free!

820
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,762
Djinni! Djinni!
Come back!

821
01:31:37,868 --> 01:31:41,265
Don't leave me here!
Don't let me die! Djinni!

822
01:31:41,367 --> 01:31:43,800
And farewell,
little master of the universe.

823
01:31:43,901 --> 01:31:46,492
Farewell! Free!

824
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:51,935
Free! Free!

825
01:31:56,872 --> 01:31:59,498
Everything of the past is forgotten.

826
01:31:59,607 --> 01:32:01,936
You have been in love with me.

827
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,939
You are in love with me.

828
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,007
You will always love me.

829
01:32:07,107 --> 01:32:10,200
Everything of the past is forgotten.

830
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:12,776
I have been in love with you.

831
01:32:12,877 --> 01:32:14,775
I am in love with you.

832
01:32:14,877 --> 01:32:18,037
I shall always love you.

833
01:32:30,282 --> 01:32:33,477
Hey!

834
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:38,508
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

835
01:32:43,418 --> 01:32:45,646
Jaffar!

836
01:32:48,119 --> 01:32:50,085
Ahmad.

837
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,023
Let's go!

838
01:33:51,771 --> 01:33:54,897
Put them in prison.

839
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:58,235
Chain them to opposite walls.

840
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,774
In the morning,
they die the death of a thousand cuts.

841
01:34:34,282 --> 01:34:37,682
I have failed, my love.
Forgive me.

842
01:34:39,118 --> 01:34:41,084
I have no regrets.

843
01:34:41,187 --> 01:34:43,676
We are together.

844
01:34:43,787 --> 01:34:46,718
And shall be for the rest of our lives.

845
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:49,981
We shall never again
know the torture of being apart.

846
01:34:50,089 --> 01:34:53,317
And if death is not the end,
we shall go on together.

847
01:35:01,058 --> 01:35:03,024
Abu and I parted quarreling.

848
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,216
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry.

849
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:11,455
Abu, my friend...

850
01:35:11,561 --> 01:35:14,755
good-bye and forgive me.

851
01:35:14,861 --> 01:35:18,192
No. I won't say good-bye.

852
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:20,991
I'll help.

853
01:35:21,097 --> 01:35:23,121
But how? How?

854
01:35:25,065 --> 01:35:27,530
If I can't help, I won't see!

855
01:36:36,085 --> 01:36:38,177
Welcome, our prince.

856
01:36:49,555 --> 01:36:52,579
Welcome, little prince.

857
01:37:03,392 --> 01:37:06,724
Father of a beard,
there's some mistake.

858
01:37:06,827 --> 01:37:08,760
I'm not a prince.

859
01:37:08,861 --> 01:37:10,759
I'm only a thief.

860
01:37:10,862 --> 01:37:14,488
For you we have been waiting
twice 2,000 years.

861
01:37:14,596 --> 01:37:16,687
Oh, no. Not waiting for me...

862
01:37:16,796 --> 01:37:19,957
because I didn't know I was coming,
and I don't know how I've come.

863
01:37:20,997 --> 01:37:23,087
Who are you, father of miracles?

864
01:37:24,497 --> 01:37:26,466
And where am I?

865
01:37:26,565 --> 01:37:28,828
This is the Land of Legend...

866
01:37:28,933 --> 01:37:33,923
where everything is possible
when seen through the eyes of youth.

867
01:37:34,034 --> 01:37:37,866
We are the remnant of the Golden Age.

868
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:41,027
Golden because gold was nothing.

869
01:37:41,138 --> 01:37:44,570
No more than the sand
beneath your feet...

870
01:37:44,672 --> 01:37:47,230
or the stone that we became.

871
01:37:47,338 --> 01:37:49,271
How did you become stone?

872
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:51,668
We were petrified with horror...

873
01:37:51,774 --> 01:37:54,400
by the evil done among men...

874
01:37:54,507 --> 01:37:56,406
when they ceased to be children...

875
01:37:56,508 --> 01:37:59,475
and to believe in the beauty
of the impossible.

876
01:37:59,575 --> 01:38:04,235
But whenever the heart of a child
returns to us...

877
01:38:04,342 --> 01:38:06,242
and comes into us...

878
01:38:06,344 --> 01:38:08,867
we live again.

879
01:38:08,978 --> 01:38:11,638
And so, as that child...

880
01:38:11,745 --> 01:38:14,075
you are to be my successor.

881
01:38:14,178 --> 01:38:16,739
Now, come with me...

882
01:38:17,913 --> 01:38:22,279
and I will present you
with two insignia...

883
01:38:22,382 --> 01:38:24,405
of true kingship.

884
01:38:31,718 --> 01:38:33,685
Here they are.

885
01:38:43,322 --> 01:38:47,277
Aim this only at injustice,
and you cannot fail.

886
01:38:48,955 --> 01:38:52,252
Oh, no, father of kindness.
I don't want it.

887
01:38:52,356 --> 01:38:54,322
I don't want to be a king.

888
01:38:54,425 --> 01:38:57,119
- I only want to save my friend.
- Well, this will help you.

889
01:38:57,225 --> 01:39:00,783
Take it. And now...

890
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:03,359
I do homage...

891
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:05,618
for you are king...

892
01:39:05,727 --> 01:39:08,956
and all in our kingdom is yours...

893
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:13,827
except that carpet,
which I keep for myself.

894
01:39:13,931 --> 01:39:15,828
For on that carpet...

895
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:19,125
which flies when it is bidden -
\x22Fly, carpet\x22-

896
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:23,325
I shall go to paradise
at the hour appointed.

897
01:39:31,933 --> 01:39:35,334
It is told, though Allah is
wiser or more merciful...

898
01:39:35,436 --> 01:39:38,232
there was in the past of the ages
a king among kings...

899
01:39:38,337 --> 01:39:42,598
a master of arms and of armies,
of vessels and auxiliaries.

900
01:39:42,704 --> 01:39:46,605
And this master of time and people
was an oppressor to both...

901
01:39:46,706 --> 01:39:50,366
until the earth was as pitch on the
faces of his subjects and his slaves...

902
01:39:50,473 --> 01:39:52,497
and they groaned together in secret...

903
01:39:52,607 --> 01:39:54,903
and were slayed in the marketplace.

904
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,998
But a wise man
among the sages of Bagdad...

905
01:39:58,111 --> 01:40:00,167
comforted them
with a prophecy, saying...

906
01:40:00,277 --> 01:40:02,677
\x22In the fullness of time,
a liberator shall come upon you...

907
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:04,611
and this shall be the sign ofhim. \x22

908
01:40:17,382 --> 01:40:20,745
O Allah,
I know you don't much like stealing.

909
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:23,476
I'll never steal again.
You can trust me.

910
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:28,676
Just this once more. Just this little
carpet so as to get to Bagdad in time.

911
01:40:28,785 --> 01:40:31,081
When the old king's hour comes...

912
01:40:31,185 --> 01:40:34,015
he won't want a carpet
to fly to paradise.

913
01:40:34,118 --> 01:40:36,882
Then you, O Allah,
will take him by the hand...

914
01:40:36,986 --> 01:40:39,248
gentle and kind as he is...

915
01:40:39,355 --> 01:40:41,481
and lead him into eternal bliss.

916
01:40:41,588 --> 01:40:46,145
Aren't I right? But I must go
to Bagdad to save my friend.

917
01:40:46,254 --> 01:40:49,018
It's a question of minutes.
You must see that.

918
01:40:49,124 --> 01:40:53,181
O Allah, lord ofjustice,
let me steal.

919
01:40:53,291 --> 01:40:55,850
Fly, carpet.

920
01:40:57,026 --> 01:40:58,822
Wait.

921
01:41:06,961 --> 01:41:08,930
Fly, carpet!

922
01:41:58,075 --> 01:42:00,670
Why do you close your eyes?

923
01:42:00,778 --> 01:42:03,266
There's little time left to see him.

924
01:42:05,612 --> 01:42:08,171
The people cried, \x22We shall look
for him in the clouds indeed...

925
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:10,836
\x22for if the great are powerless
to save us from this tyrant...

926
01:42:10,947 --> 01:42:12,505
how can one of no account avail? \x22

927
01:42:12,615 --> 01:42:15,444
And the reader
of the Milky Way replied...

928
01:42:15,547 --> 01:42:18,537
\x22Have faith, trust in Allah...

929
01:42:18,648 --> 01:42:21,638
\x22for there, one day in the blue,
you shall see a boy...

930
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:24,115
\x22the lowest of the low,
mounted on a cloud...

931
01:42:24,218 --> 01:42:28,117
\x22and that cloud shall be as strong
as the hills beneath the snow...

932
01:42:28,218 --> 01:42:30,118
\x22and from the ranges of the sky...

933
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:34,051
he shall destroy this tyrant
with the arrow ofjustice. \x22

934
01:43:42,306 --> 01:43:44,497
The horse!

935
01:43:53,011 --> 01:43:54,908
Up, quickly!

936
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:58,334
Ahmad!

937
01:43:59,445 --> 01:44:00,809
Jaffar!

938
01:44:58,195 --> 01:45:02,185
My people,
I owe everything to Abu...

939
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,888
and when he grows into a man,
he shall be my grand vizier.

940
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:11,021
He shall be sent
to the best school in Bagdad...

941
01:45:11,131 --> 01:45:15,565
and all the wise men of the East shall
teach him all the wisdom of the world.

942
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:19,599
He shall be the wisest of men,
and in those future days...

943
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,657
when he will be full of knowledge,
science and dignity...

944
01:45:23,769 --> 01:45:27,759
he will be the shining example
for the youths of Bagdad...

945
01:45:27,869 --> 01:45:31,597
and they may remember how the
little thief became the dignifi -

946
01:45:31,703 --> 01:45:35,397
Hey! Abu! Where are you going?

947
01:45:35,505 --> 01:45:37,631
You've got what you wanted.

948
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:40,706
Now, I'm going to find what I want.

949
01:45:40,808 --> 01:45:42,536
- What's that?
- Some fun.

950
01:45:42,641 --> 01:45:46,438
An adventure at last!
