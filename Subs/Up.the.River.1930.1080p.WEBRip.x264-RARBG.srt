1
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:03,091
Look at this, a roadster.
And the gang promised me a limousine.

2
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:06,151
- It's piecrust to you, ain't it?
- Shut up, you sap.

3
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:09,665
We ain't out of danger yet.
It's 10 miles to town. Well, so long.

4
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,825
I hope I never see you again.

5
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,631
- Boy, I hate these country prisons.
- I hate all prisons.

6
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:17,002
- The food is bad.
- Well, listen. Next time–

7
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:19,132
There ain't gonna be any next time.
Not for me.

8
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:22,109
- No? What are you gonna do for a livin'?
- Start a chicken farm.

9
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,408
You can start with 100 eggs,
and by saving the pullets...

10
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,971
at the end of the year
you'll have 10,000 eggs.

11
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,575
- Yeah? Listen. Get out and fix that.
- What's the matter?

12
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:32,052
- I think we got a flat tire.
- Flat tire?

13
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,555
That's luck for you.
I don't see any flat tire.

14
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:37,092
No? Well, buy a mirror!

15
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,391
Hey, there!

16
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:23,200
Friends, we will hear
from Brother Dan...

17
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:26,207
once lost in the sea of sin...

18
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:30,109
but now safe on the shores of love.

19
00:02:30,178 --> 00:02:34,013
Praise be! Praise be! Praise be!

20
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:39,885
Friends, you wouldn't "tink" to look at me
now that I once was as wicked as you.

21
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:44,017
But, yea, verily, there's no sinner
among you what I can't call "brudder."

22
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:47,529
You know how I got lost in crime and sin?
Bad company.

23
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:51,658
But I found the error of my ways.
I found that crime don't pay.

24
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,904
Now I'm happy in the light
and love the whole world.

25
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:58,805
Praise be! Praise be!

26
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:02,675
Yeah, even the-the depraved
wretch what led me into sin...

27
00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:05,578
even him I love and forgive.

28
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:08,173
<i>And remember, "brudders,"
crime don't pay.</i>

29
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,459
No, sir.
Crime don't pay.

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,435
And verily, I say to you...

31
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:32,202
even the depraved wr–
louse... what led me into sin...

32
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:34,334
even him I love and forgive.

33
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:37,299
And there is a blow
of vengeance coming

34
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,994
what– on all sinners
what knows no mercy.

35
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:45,780
There is retribution for all. And there
is "tunderbolts" comin' from the sky...

36
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:48,221
on your head, unexpected.

37
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,285
And verily I say to you, the wages of sin
is a punch in the jaw, you louse!

38
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:06,801
What are you pinchin' me for?
He's the one that did it!

39
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:27,552
Twenty-four, 26...

40
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,828
28, 30, 32...

41
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,396
34, 36, 38, 40, 42.

42
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,752
<i>Another one?
Hello, Al. Another load?</i>

43
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:55,484
- Howdy, Joe. Yeah.
- Got another load for you.

44
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:03,525
- Oh, look at the mug on that guy.
- Look at that pan!

45
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:09,194
Say, is there a piccolo player
in the crowd?

46
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,105
Why, no, sir.
But I can play a saxophone.

47
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:15,584
So that's what you're in for.

48
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:16,903
For three months,

49
00:05:16,928 --> 00:05:20,605
I been tryin' to get a piccolo player,
and all they send up is saxophones.

50
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:23,269
Just a lot of punks.
That's all.

51
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:26,221
<i>Oh, now that's a shame.</i>

52
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,951
<i>What'd you do, boy,
rob your mama's bank?</i>

53
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,550
<i>Poor kids.
What do you think of that?</i>

54
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:34,460
<i>- Ain't that a dirty shame?
- Get the pan on this guy.</i>

55
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,734
I been in this jail 40 years...

56
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:43,636
and the saps they send up here
gets worse and worse.

57
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,640
It's gettin' to be a day nursery.

58
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:48,700
They wouldn't even allow
those kind of guys in here in my time.

59
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:51,590
How'd they keep 'em out?
Blackball 'em?

60
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,759
You know what they'd have
called Big Pete in my day?

61
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:55,931
- What?
- A sissy.

62
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,620
Yeah, there was men in those days–

63
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:02,249
men with needles in their chests,
men like meself.

64
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:04,486
Come on over and play ball.

65
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:15,565
Just one week before the big game,
and they had to go and pardon the pitcher.

66
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:19,665
It's politics.
That's what it is– politics.

67
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:23,508
- Somebody higher up don't want us to win.
- You know who it is?

68
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,648
The governor.

69
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:29,628
Jessell!

70
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:31,836
Well, if it ain't little Morris.
So you're here!

71
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:34,481
Yes, I'm here.
And you're here too, where you belong.

72
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,351
You got me all wrong, kid.

73
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:38,515
I lost more money on
that horse than you did.

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,327
Did you, Jessell? Did you lose
your position and money and friends?

75
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,832
And mother?
She died at my trial. You killed her.

76
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,665
<i>- If it hadn't been for you</i>–
<i>- Shut up, you little swine.</i>

77
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:51,036
- You were a thief long before I knew you.
- That's a lie! Take it back!

78
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,041
Cut it out!
Go on. Scram!

79
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:58,675
Don't do that. Come on.
Don't take it so hard.

80
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,378
I can't help it.
How did your family feel?

81
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:08,647
Well, they don't know.

82
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:13,559
I changed my name.
They think I'm in China.

83
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:17,030
- How'd you do that?
- Well, I got friends out there.

84
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:22,468
They forward my letters home
and cable my folks once a month.

85
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,032
I'll see you around.
I work in the office there.

86
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:32,012
Got a lot of new fish coming in.
You know, associates, inmates.

87
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,174
Come on, son.
Buck up, boy.

88
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:38,985
<i>Come on, you fellas, will you? Come on.</i>

89
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:42,183
All right, Pop.
What's the hurry?

90
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:46,922
- I got plenty of time– 30 years.
- Nix, only 20 for me.

91
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,295
Say, do you think they'd mind
if I was to join in?

92
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,601
- Can you play ball?
- Why, sure.

93
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:02,110
Go on and get over there then.
Pop'll plaster you with kisses. Hurry up.

94
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,046
And this is the men's yard.

95
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:07,776
Aren't you afraid here with
all these dreadful characters?

96
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,445
Oh, dear, no.
They're just like little children to me.

97
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,886
In fact, to all the welfare workers.

98
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,824
Watch it.

99
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,793
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Massey?

100
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:24,765
- How do you do?
- So jolly to see you again.

101
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,961
Uh, I missed you terribly last Thursday.

102
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:30,301
Had some friends up from the city.
Charming people.

103
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:33,706
They were very disappointed
not to meet you.

104
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:37,473
Well, cheerio.
See you again.

105
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:39,776
- You see?
- And who is he?

106
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:43,580
Electrical genius.
Wiretapper.

107
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,123
Hi, Dooley.

108
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:54,619
Famous strangler.

109
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:58,224
Now we go over to the welfare rooms.
You see? They're right over there.

110
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,565
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

111
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:04,003
<i>He's just amusing little Jean...</i>

112
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:06,041
the warden's daughter.

113
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:08,667
Jean, say hello to my friends.

114
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:10,905
- How do you do?
- How do you do, dear?

115
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:12,971
Have you a kiss for Mrs. Massey?

116
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:16,815
- Yes, Mrs. Massey. I gave it to Rex.
- The dog?

117
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:20,185
Let's go over to the welfare room.

118
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:23,657
- Okay, what's next, Eddie?
<i>- Try this one, Jean.</i>

119
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,829
<i>That-a-boy, Eddie.</i>

120
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:31,697
<i>- Oh, I can do that!</i>
- No, you can't.

121
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:32,765
Geez, that-a-girl!

122
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:35,527
Here's one you can't do.
Walk on your ear, Jean.

123
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:37,925
No.
Of course not!

124
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,867
I got him.

125
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:44,030
<i>Look this way please.</i>

126
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:47,241
<i>Keep smilin' now.</i>

127
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,215
<i>Big smile, St. Louis.</i>

128
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:56,217
<i>All right, one with your lawyer,
St. Louis.</i>

129
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,219
Come on.
Get over here, Marvin.

130
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,552
<i>- Thanks!</i>
- Thank you.

131
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:04,787
<i>Come on, buddy. Move up.
Guy with the camera, move up.</i>

132
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:31,180
Through here.
Number one, right here please.

133
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:34,017
- Number two, right here.
- Well, hello, Sophie.

134
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:37,024
<i>- Number three</i>–
- Hello, Kitty. Glad to see you back again.

135
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:39,409
Lemme see. I ain't seen you
in about a month, ain't it?

136
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:40,097
I know.

137
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:42,172
Well, come on. I'm gonna
take care of you two myself.

138
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:46,070
Lovely. By golly, you girls– I'm going
to check these two girls in personally.

139
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:47,423
<i>How's it been?</i>

140
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:49,570
<i>Everything is lovely.
We've got a new wing on the place.</i>

141
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,879
<i>The mockingbirds
are singing just the same.</i>

142
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,343
<i>- Name?</i>
- Judith Fields.

143
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,642
<i>- Age?</i>
- Twenty-one.

144
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:06,410
- Your first offense?
<i>- The first time they caught me.</i>

145
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:11,793
- Fraud?
- I told fortunes.

146
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,260
<i>And they gave you
three years for that?</i>

147
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:18,357
Well, after I'd finished
telling fortunes, I'd, uh...

148
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,368
recommend certain oil stocks.

149
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,529
Oh.

150
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:25,369
Well, then, you worked with someone?

151
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,035
<i>- A broker.</i>
- Did you know what you were doing?

152
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,601
- Of course.
<i>- Well, then, why?</i>

153
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:33,546
It was fun!
I always wanted to travel.

154
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:38,019
You know, we never hit the same town twice.
Oh, you can't understand.

155
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:40,715
Oh, yes, I do.
I've felt the same way.

156
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:43,553
- I was headed for China.
<i>- China?</i>

157
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,787
<i>- Gee, I'd love that.</i>
- Gee, you know...

158
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,492
we had jobs out there– three of us boys
and, well, then this came up.

159
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,865
And you threw that over
to work here?

160
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:56,564
No, you don't understand.

161
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:59,540
I don't work here.
I belong here.

162
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:04,507
- A convict?
- Yes.

163
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,913
But we call ourselves inmates.

164
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:11,714
<i>- Gee, that's tough. You don't look it.</i>
- Well, neither do you.

165
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:16,324
Well, tell me, uh, what–
what did you do?

166
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:22,820
A fight, just before the boat sailed.

167
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,100
- The other boy–
<i>- What a rotten break.</i>

168
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:30,070
Married?

169
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:32,107
No.

170
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,605
Engaged?

171
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:39,773
- Say, is that on the card?
- Oh, no.

172
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:43,443
What are you in for?

173
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,282
Shoplifting.
I was framed!

174
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:47,788
Sure.
We all was framed.

175
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:50,290
- What's yours?
- Spittin' in a river.

176
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:53,760
Gee, I didn't know
they could pinch you for that.

177
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:56,923
Why, you told Mrs. Massey
it was for winkin' at a cop.

178
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:59,729
- For not winkin' at a cop.
- Terrible creature!

179
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,430
Well, at least she don't scare 'em
to death with blackmail.

180
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:06,634
Is it necessary that I wait in here
with these other persons?

181
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:12,113
Cut the ritz! We was all arrested
and here we are, in the "cansky."

182
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,115
- Who's she?
- Edith La Verne.

183
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,714
- I don't see what men see in her.
- Oh, is that the love thief?

184
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:21,984
- The extortionist.
- Extortionist?

185
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,987
Honey, was you in the circus?

186
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:32,429
I'm so sorry for them. Really, I–

187
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,334
And <i>these</i> are the women!

188
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:37,065
Come, girls.

189
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:40,267
Yes, sir.

190
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:49,009
Say, there's nobody but ladies
allowed in here.

191
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,075
So I see.
We want to see the warden a minute.

192
00:14:51,152 --> 00:14:53,485
St. Louis!

193
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,353
<i>Okay, boys.</i>

194
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:58,757
Hey, buddy, buddy,
where's the warden?

195
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:02,797
Oh, you got company.

196
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,795
Not a bad jail.

197
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:12,763
- Hey, hey, what's the idea?
- Hello, Warden. How are you?

198
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,968
Well, St. Louis,
glad to have you with us.

199
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,102
Hello, Curly.
Say, listen, Warden.

200
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,170
I want to make
a little bargain with you.

201
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:21,596
You know, I thought you looked
a little bit worried out there in the yard.

202
00:15:21,683 --> 00:15:22,681
Yeah?

203
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:26,144
Yeah, you know, thinkin' that
I might leave here unexpectedly.

204
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:29,846
I wanna tell you somethin'.
I'm on the square with this.

205
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:32,325
I shoot straight, see?

206
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:34,377
When I decide to go,
I give fair warning.

207
00:15:34,512 --> 00:15:35,252
Yeah?

208
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:37,327
- Yeah. How's that?
- That's fair.

209
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:40,891
- Okay, Warden. That's a bargain.
- Show him to his cell.

210
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:46,134
Oh. Oh, now, please, please.
Wait a minute.

211
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,176
You know, Warden,
about this cell business–

212
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:51,712
<i>- Sorry, I haven't any cigars.</i>
- Thanks, I don't use 'em anyway.

213
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,216
About this cell business, Warden,

214
00:15:53,263 --> 00:15:55,669
if you don't mind, I don't
like to sleep too high up.

215
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:57,419
- No?
<i>- No.</i>

216
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:01,047
And, if you don't mind,
I'd like a nice airy cell, you know...

217
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:03,614
plenty of windows,
and a nice southern exposure.

218
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,956
<i>- Southern exposure?</i>
- Yeah, if you don't mind.

219
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:09,486
- I'd like a double bed. And running water.
<i>- Sure.</i>

220
00:16:09,564 --> 00:16:13,365
And I'd like–
Say, I'm not boring you, am I?

221
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:17,769
No, no. Go on.
Outta here!

222
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,901
Okay, Warden.
See you at supper.

223
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:24,445
Beans again, I suppose.

224
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:28,506
Southern exposure.
Running water.

225
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:32,350
Not too high up.
Sunshine.

226
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,221
- Say, if I had a cell like that,
I'd sleep in it myself.

227
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,340
Don't forget to lock that.
A lot of new guys come in here today.

228
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:03,475
- Letters from home?
- Yeah.

229
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,953
Yeah, pretty regular.
Now, look here.

230
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,818
Here's a picture of my mother here.

231
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:13,156
And here's my kid sister
Frances over here.

232
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:15,753
- Let's see it, Steve, will you?
- Sure.

233
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:21,024
Too skinny.
I don't like 'em so skinny.

234
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:23,094
- I like legs.
- What?

235
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,162
Limbs.

236
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,232
When I left home,
she was a kid on roller skates.

237
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:30,869
- Now she's off to college.
- College?

238
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:33,574
- Yeah.
- Gee, your folks must be swell.

239
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:38,780
And look at that house! You know, it makes
me real sick to look at a house like that.

240
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,845
- Why?
- Why?

241
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:45,359
'Cause I could've had a house like that.
Easiest thing in the world.

242
00:17:45,426 --> 00:17:48,658
Only mine would've had a tower on it
with my chicken farm...

243
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:52,222
- if it wasn't for that big baboon.
- What baboon?

244
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,599
- He come in here today.
- He means St. Louis.

245
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,199
And you shut up about him.
He's the greatest ballplayer you ever saw.

246
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:04,302
Oh, how that guy can pitch.

247
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:08,873
Well, ballplayer or no ballplayer,
he'd better stay out of my way...

248
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:11,817
'cause if I ever lay my hands on that guy,
I'll croak him.

249
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,259
I never know how
they're gonna turn out.

250
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:33,202
You're a fine guy, you are.
Leave me flat in the middle of the road.

251
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:35,402
- You callin' me a double-crosser?
- Yeah!

252
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,570
- You think I'd double-cross a pal?
- Didn't you?

253
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:41,138
- I thought there was a rumble seat.
- There was no rumble seat!

254
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:45,051
- That kind of car don't have a rumble seat.
- Keep quiet!

255
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,790
You're not gonna let–

256
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:49,129
All right, maybe there was
a rumble seat on the car.

257
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,719
- Look out for his arm, will you?
- That's the way, boys. Don't fight.

258
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:55,729
- Don't let 'em fight, Pop.
- I won't let 'em.

259
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,197
- Steve's my name.
- How are you? Glad to know you, kid.

260
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:01,724
Glad to know you too.
What do you say we turn in, boys?

261
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:04,897
- I think you're up there.
- Me?

262
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:19,811
Say, you wouldn't let a pitcher
climb way up there, would you?

263
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:22,186
- He might strain his arm.
- I've gotta throw too, ain't I?

264
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,885
You throw higher than him.
You have to throw way down to second base.

265
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,237
I ain't gonna let that guy
put anything else over on me.

266
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:28,463
I'm gettin' smart!

267
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:31,609
What do you mean,
put something over on you?

268
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:33,600
Wait a minute.

269
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,636
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not dumb.

270
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:39,606
I'm settlin' this thing without any fighting.
Think of a number from one to 10.

271
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:41,437
- One to 10?
- Yeah.

272
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,910
- Seven.
- That's it. You sleep in the lower one.

273
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:46,277
- Get on up there.
- That's fair enough, ain't it?

274
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,285
Long as I lost on the level, it's okay.

275
00:21:01,596 --> 00:21:04,862
Say, on second thought, I remember.

276
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,704
There was a rumble seat
on that car, all right.

277
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:08,796
Oh, shut up!

278
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:49,305
Knock it off, Freda.
Try and get some sleep.

279
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:22,376
All out!

280
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:31,609
Attention.
Forward. March!

281
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:39,494
Well, how are you today, Genesis?

282
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,462
How is y'all, Mrs. Massey?

283
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:51,628
Well, Judy, quite an honor it seems to me to
be selected to instruct the warden's daughter.

284
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,642
Of course, it's quite
against my better judgment...

285
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:57,338
but, uh, I hope it'll turn out all right.

286
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:59,403
Thank you, Mrs. Massey.

287
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,245
<i>Two and two is four.
Four and four is eight.</i>

288
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:05,411
- Sour grapes, kid. Sour grapes.
- Mrs. Reilly...

289
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,955
can Judy and I go in the yard
and take a walk?

290
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:10,218
<i>- Surely, dear. Go right along.</i>
- Thank you.

291
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,828
Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Massey?

292
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:18,091
What a beautiful apple.

293
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,416
Strange. Such good-looking girls,
aren't them?

294
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:25,304
- Not a homely one among them.
- Thank you, Mrs. Massey.

295
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:29,743
Years ago, when I started doing
welfare work, it was quite the reverse.

296
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,837
Well, in those days
women wore long skirts.

297
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,926
The only ones that were acquitted...

298
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,841
were the ones smart enough
to cross their legs during the trial.

299
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:41,509
What a peculiar psychology.
Have an apple, dear.

300
00:23:41,793 --> 00:23:43,242
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Massey.

301
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,385
- And I have a magazine for you, my dear.
- Thank you, Mrs. Massey.

302
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,862
And here's the latest style
magazine for you.

303
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,593
Girls, isn't this jolly?

304
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,158
Dewey's won the Battle of Manila.

305
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,379
I oughta–

306
00:23:56,614 --> 00:23:59,361
Why don't you leave me alone?
I haven't done anything to you.

307
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,039
What a jam!

308
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,696
<i>Let 'im alone!</i>

309
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:07,780
- What do you mean let him alone?
- I said let him alone. Scram, kid.

310
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:10,579
What are you gonna do?
Make a favorite of that punk around here?

311
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:11,764
Keep your hands off him.

312
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,737
Say, who are you to tell me
to keep my hands off anybody?

313
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,588
What's the matter, Steve?
What's all the trouble?

314
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:20,560
Pop and I found this big lug,
and he give me an argument.

315
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,563
He thinks everybody's scared of him.

316
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,099
- Sure, everybody's scared of me.
<i>- Everybody's scared, are they?</i>

317
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,732
You don't wanna bother with them guys.
It's a waste of breath.

318
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:35,470
I know, but look out for your arm.
Look out for your arm.

319
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:37,769
Hey, the "ame-day" is
waitin' at the "ate-gay."

320
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:38,684
Thanks.

321
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,675
Don't mention it.

322
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:46,644
Hey, Steve.
I wouldn't go down there.

323
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:48,301
Keep away from that girl.

324
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,563
Gettin' pretty near your parole.
I wouldn't take any chances.

325
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah, listen, kid.
He's right about that.

326
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:57,371
You do what Pop says,
and you'll never go wrong.

327
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,426
- I'll go.
- Hey–

328
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:04,205
Hey, some guy hit a great big lug
out there right on the button.

329
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:10,843
Hey, buddy, I'm sorry.
I butted into something.

330
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,609
I didn't know. She don't want to see me.
She wants to see you.

331
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,651
- Me?
- Yeah.

332
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:19,482
I didn't know that you two
were fond of each other.

333
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:22,751
Well, gee, I don't know
how fond she is of me...

334
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:25,918
but I think she's a fine girl.

335
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:29,395
- Well, ain't you never said anything to her?
- No, I haven't had a chance.

336
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:33,764
You know what the rules are. Oh, we waved
a couple of times from the window.

337
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,633
Well, you come on over.
I'd like to have you meet her.

338
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:38,832
Yeah, but listen,
if she's caught talkin' to me–

339
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:41,705
Don't let that worry you.
I'll take care of all that.

340
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,869
<i>Hey, lug. Come here.</i>

341
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,479
No, he means you.

342
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,179
Say, who do you think you are,
ordering me around? What do you want?

343
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:56,213
♪ Judy's got a boyfriend
Judy's got a– ♪

344
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,094
Jean–

345
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:00,086
Judy, there's a couple of
fellas in reception to see you.

346
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,232
<i>I got the pass right here.</i>

347
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:13,972
Jean, come over here. Your Uncle Danny
wants to tell you a fairy story.

348
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,067
Aw, Danny.

349
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,271
Why does a chicken cross the street?

350
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:21,372
To get on the other side.

351
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:25,146
Heard you were being paroled
in a few days.

352
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,587
Yes, I am.

353
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:31,626
I just wanted to say good-bye
to you before you left and...

354
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:36,425
thank you for being so sweet
to me that day in the office.

355
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:38,864
Well, that's all right.

356
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:42,267
I've– I've been trying
to get to see you too...

357
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:47,104
because, well, I– I have a lot of things
I want to talk to you about.

358
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:53,914
Remember that first day in the office
when I asked you if you were engaged?

359
00:26:53,981 --> 00:26:57,110
Yes, and I said,
"Is that on the card?"

360
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:01,814
Yeah. Well it–
You know it wasn't.

361
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:06,157
I wanted to know because–

362
00:27:06,227 --> 00:27:08,924
Well, are you engaged?

363
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:13,633
No, Steve, I'm not.
Are you?

364
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:19,932
No, I'm not.
Oh, but I'd like to be...

365
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,942
to you.

366
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,843
Now, look out for this one, Jean.
This is a hard one.

367
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:30,182
Why does the president of the United States
wear a high silk hat?

368
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,542
To keep his head warm.

369
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:42,196
I'm on the level too, Steve.
But I guess it– it can't be.

370
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,528
Why not?

371
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:48,626
Well, I've heard all about
your home and your family and–

372
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,774
- Well, I'm-I'm just–
- Well, wait a minute.

373
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,606
That's just storybook stuff
about the rich boy

374
00:27:56,705 --> 00:27:58,824
and the poor girl
not being able to marry.

375
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,615
Doesn't count here at all.

376
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:06,382
When we get outta here, we're just
gonna be a couple of ex-convicts...

377
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:08,388
and that's not storybook stuff.

378
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:11,220
We got to start all over,
bottom of the ladder.

379
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:16,856
And I–
I'd like for us to start together.

380
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:24,516
Well, that is, if–
if you're fond enough of me.

381
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:30,026
I am fond of you, Steve.

382
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,091
I'm more than fond of you.

383
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:38,604
If there was five birds in a tree,
and St. Louis and I shot one of the birds...

384
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,939
how many of the birds
would be left in the tree?

385
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:43,274
None, because they'd all fly away.

386
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:59,184
Jean, you ain't been reading a book,
have you?

387
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:01,196
- No.
- Can't understand it.

388
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:05,462
- I'll wave you an answer tonight.
- Beat it, kid.

389
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:08,902
- Judy, that isn't the man you–
- Judy, tell 'im you're not at home.

390
00:29:15,944 --> 00:29:20,111
Fellas, Miss Fields.

391
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,117
Two minutes.

392
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:31,652
Well, darling, here I am.

393
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,993
Just three months too late, Frosby,
and never mind the "darling."

394
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,373
But, Judy–

395
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:38,739
I didn't come in here because
I wanted to see you.

396
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:42,098
I came in here because I wanted
to tell you what a dirty rat you are.

397
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:44,106
<i>- You don't understand</i>–
- I do understand now.

398
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:46,108
I thought your business
was a little shady...

399
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,610
but I didn't know
it was gonna land me in jail.

400
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:52,375
- Well, it's finished. I'm paying for it.
<i>- What could I do?</i>

401
00:29:52,448 --> 00:29:54,815
What could you do?
You could have stayed and faced it out...

402
00:29:54,883 --> 00:29:57,216
not run away like a coward
and leave me to take the rap.

403
00:29:57,286 --> 00:30:02,122
<i>Listen, Judy. I've got friends and influence,
and I've got some dough left.</i>

404
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:05,923
<i>- I can get you out, and we can go away.</i>
- We? We can't do anything.

405
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:10,193
<i>I'm through with you and all your kind.
Now, listen.</i>

406
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:14,532
There's a fine, clean kid inside,
and he's stuck on me.

407
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:17,038
And I'm crazy about him.

408
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:19,097
He gets outta here in a week.

409
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:21,473
He's gonna wait for me.

410
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:26,345
We're gonna start together
at the bottom of the ladder–

411
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:27,940
Steve and I.

412
00:30:28,023 --> 00:30:29,156
Steve.

413
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:32,422
Yes, that's the name of the kid
that's waitin' in there for me.

414
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,500
He's waitin' in there now
for my answer.

415
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,797
Okay, Judy.
Time's up!

416
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:51,034
Genny, be sure this gets to him.
Don't forget.

417
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:06,046
And Genesis, poor lamb.

418
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:09,182
Oh, Miss Massey. Miss Massey.

419
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:11,727
You is such a good woman.

420
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:15,230
- And I's such a bad woman.
- No, Genny.

421
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:18,734
If I'd only met you
when I was a little child...

422
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:23,866
I'd have been in my chariot...

423
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:26,238
on my way to glory.

424
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:29,301
- There, there.
- Oh, Genny.

425
00:31:29,378 --> 00:31:35,340
You mustn't cry like that.
Everything's gonna be all right.

426
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:39,718
Don't cry.

427
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:44,896
That's two chocolate bars
and an apple you owes me now.

428
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:57,620
- What's goin' on?
- Signal.

429
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,159
- Yeah?
- Yeah, from the women's quarters.

430
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:03,162
- Oh, is that how they do it?
- Sure. Didn't you know that?

431
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:05,164
With all the cans you've been in.

432
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:08,998
Yeah, but I never stayed in one
long enough to find those things out.

433
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:11,367
- What does it say?
- Wait a minute.

434
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,837
Message...

435
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:22,848
gate.

436
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,850
Good day, boys.

437
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:28,149
Mrs. Massey, look at your shoes!
All dusty again. Imagine that.

438
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:33,319
Why, boys, every time I come through
that gate, you clean off my shoes.

439
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:35,058
That's all right, Mrs. Massey.
It's a pleasure.

440
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,647
Not at all.

441
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:37,980
- Good-bye, boys.
- Good-bye.

442
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,555
- Good-bye. Did you get it?
- For Steve.

443
00:32:40,728 --> 00:32:42,959
Ah, none of them bimbos
ever write me.

444
00:32:43,202 --> 00:32:46,229
No sex appeal, my boy.
No sex appeal.

445
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:48,105
<i>- Where's Steve?</i>
- Why?

446
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,651
- I got a kite for him.
- I'll take it.

447
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,425
- You'll take it?
- I'm in on this.

448
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:52,769
Oh.

449
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:58,716
Hey, don't look over my shoulder
when I'm reading Steve's mail.

450
00:32:58,784 --> 00:33:01,276
This is from a lady.

451
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:12,098
Hey, Steve.
Come here a minute, will ya?

452
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,266
- Congratulations, Steve.
- For what?

453
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:24,003
Well, you're e–
Uh, I got a little note here for you.

454
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:42,818
I'm engaged.

455
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,524
- No!
- Yeah.

456
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:47,931
- Judy.
- No!

457
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,935
Yeah.

458
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,929
Hey, you fellas–
You didn't read this, did you?

459
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:58,034
Nah.

460
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,282
Four times six– 25.

461
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:09,919
- No, dear. It's 24.
<i>- Hello, Judy.</i>

462
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:12,190
<i>- How's the youngster getting on?</i>
- Just fine, Warden.

463
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:14,994
That's great.

464
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:17,296
<i>1136 wants to see you, boss.</i>

465
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:20,338
- I'm busy.
<i>- It's Steve. He wants to say good-bye.</i>

466
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:24,103
Oh, sure.
Show him in.

467
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,141
Good luck to you, my boy.

468
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:33,446
Thanks, Warden.

469
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:38,480
I, uh, I know
it's against the rules...

470
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:42,789
but could I give you a message
for a girl here?

471
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,795
A prisoner?

472
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:48,424
You see, we're, well–
We're engaged.

473
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:51,128
I want her to know that
I'm gonna work hard for her...

474
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,898
and make something of myself
so that when she's free–

475
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:57,305
Just you wait a moment. Wait till
I get a pencil and write that message down.

476
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:59,366
- Here's a pencil, Daddy.
- All right, bring it to me.

477
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:01,810
How am I going to get it
unless you bring it to me?

478
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:06,813
- I'll write every week.
- I won't write at all.

479
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:11,651
Your family mustn't see letters
with this postmark.

480
00:35:11,722 --> 00:35:13,884
They mustn't know.

481
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:17,456
Don't worry.
I'll stick it out.

482
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:21,565
It's only five months.

483
00:35:24,802 --> 00:35:27,169
You won't forget?

484
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:48,619
Huh? Oh-Oh, yes.
I found a pencil.

485
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,627
Now, what was that message?

486
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:55,758
Well, what I wanted to say was,
"Thanks."

487
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,503
So long, Jean.

488
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:10,804
Four times eight– 43.

489
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:15,213
- He's gone.
- Four times nine–

490
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,824
Bye-bye.

491
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:22,826
- Don't come back!
- I'll do that.

492
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:24,953
Take care of yourself, kid.
I'm gonna miss you.

493
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,726
- Look out for the kids.
- You bet I will, Steve.

494
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:30,165
Bye!

495
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:05,726
Well, Stephen!
Why, I'm glad to see you.

496
00:37:05,812 --> 00:37:08,714
Thank you very much, Mr. Sterling.
I'm glad to be home.

497
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:11,598
Well, good-bye.
Hope you've enjoyed the service.

498
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,668
- Yes, we have.
- Hope to see you next Sunday.

499
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:16,170
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, girls. Good-bye.

500
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:21,041
Glad to see you.

501
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:24,041
- Why, hello, Steve.
- Hello.

502
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,674
- How's China?
- Oh, fine.

503
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,776
Thought you'd be wearing a pigtail.
You going back there?

504
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:30,947
No. Not till I've been around home
for a while.

505
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:34,186
No, he's going home a while
and get some of Mother's good cooking.

506
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,524
How do you do, sir?

507
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:39,642
You're a stranger here, aren't you?

508
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:41,511
- Yes.
- I'm glad to see you at our service.

509
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:44,804
Thank you very much.
Most delightfully edifying.

510
00:37:45,102 --> 00:37:48,102
- My name is Frosby.
- I'm Reverend Sterling.

511
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,348
Delighted to meet you, I'm sure.

512
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:53,587
- Oh, isn't that Stephen–
- Jordan. Do you know him?

513
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:58,001
No, I'm not acquainted with him personally,
but I know a very dear friend of his.

514
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:01,532
- I should be delighted to introduce you.
- Most gracious of you.

515
00:38:04,437 --> 00:38:07,032
Mr.Jordan, will you allow me
to present Mr. Frosby?

516
00:38:07,106 --> 00:38:10,304
- How do you do, Mr. Frosby?
- This is her son, Stephen.

517
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:13,039
- How do you do?
- How do you do? My sister, Cynthia.

518
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:15,138
- How do you do?
- Ma'am.

519
00:38:15,276 --> 00:38:18,516
I'm very, very pleased to
meet the Jordan family.

520
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,200
In fact, I might say
I was most anxious.

521
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,229
Really?

522
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,439
Indeed. Your son and I happen
to have a mutual acquaintance.

523
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,904
- Yes?
- A Miss Fields. A Miss Judith Fields.

524
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,660
- She was formerly in my employ.
<i>- Really?</i>

525
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:36,294
How interesting. Perhaps you'd come
and have supper with us tonight.

526
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:37,314
Mother, I–

527
00:38:37,393 --> 00:38:40,387
It's all right, dear.
Sophie always has enough for a dozen.

528
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,636
- You'll come, won't you?
- Thank you very much.

529
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:44,701
- Good-bye, Mr. Sterling.
<i>- Good-bye.</i>

530
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:47,872
- Supper is at 6:00.
- I shall be there most promptly.

531
00:38:51,884 --> 00:38:54,251
See you this evening.

532
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:01,416
Oh, I'm going to open up
a branch office here.

533
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:05,898
Of course, I shall miss Judy.
She was a most valuable assistant.

534
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,963
But as you know everyone in town...

535
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:12,403
you may be able
to take her position.

536
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:23,305
<i>Don't forget your A BC's, boys.</i>

537
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:25,045
Hiya, lug.
What are you doing in there?

538
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:28,646
- We're takin' intelligence tests.
- Thought we was trying out for the show.

539
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,691
Hey, you're in the wrong line.
Get over in front of the welfare building.

540
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:34,227
Any of you guys that's
trying out for the show.

541
00:39:34,293 --> 00:39:36,319
You stick here.
You're gonna take a test.

542
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:40,026
You better take that intelligence test, boy.
You'll need it.

543
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:51,802
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah?

544
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:54,347
- Gimme the works here, will you?
- Right.

545
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,299
Come on, come on.

546
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:59,001
Get a little pep into it.
What's the matter?

547
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:02,015
- What's the matter with you? You stiff?
- St. Louis.

548
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:05,058
Keep your back turned, kid.

549
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,185
- Heard from Steve?
- No.

550
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,594
I have.
He's in a jam.

551
00:40:10,663 --> 00:40:13,258
- How?
- You know Frosby?

552
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:15,324
He's the guy you took
the rap for, isn't he?

553
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:16,109
Yeah.

554
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:19,534
He followed Steve to New England.
He's trying to use him.

555
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:22,871
- Blackmail, huh?
- The old stock racket.

556
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,002
- He threatened to–
- Yeah, yeah. I know.

557
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:29,041
He's gonna tell the folks
that Steve was in the stir, huh?

558
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:34,816
- What'll I do?
- You don't do nothin', kid.

559
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:36,822
Just leave it to me.

560
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:41,184
- Say, listen, Judy.
- Yeah?

561
00:40:42,462 --> 00:40:46,729
- Are you really stuck on Steve?
- Yeah.

562
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:52,871
There's, uh, no chance for a guy
to muscle in there, is there?

563
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,440
I'm on the level.

564
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:01,447
- I really love him.
- Okay, baby.

565
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:08,619
What does m-o-r-o-n spell?

566
00:41:09,655 --> 00:41:12,454
Why– Why, that spells moron.

567
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:15,485
I passed, 100%.

568
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:18,524
Hey, lug, you was never
in New England, were you?

569
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:19,938
No.

570
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,980
Well, you're goin' now.

571
00:41:43,289 --> 00:41:45,349
Hello, fellas.

572
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:48,883
As you know, we're gathered here tonight
for our annual entertainment...

573
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:53,729
which is sponsored by
our good friend, Mrs. Massey.

574
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:02,607
Also, we have as
our honored guests...

575
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:07,375
a number of people from the outside,
which we take great pleasure in welcoming.

576
00:42:12,451 --> 00:42:15,114
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

577
00:42:15,188 --> 00:42:19,558
I take great pleasure in introducing
our master of ceremonies–

578
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:25,257
One who is a master of ceremonies,
one who has acted in a similar capacity...

579
00:42:25,331 --> 00:42:28,358
in a great many institutions
of this kind...

580
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:31,199
both in this country and abroad...

581
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:37,176
and one whom we hope to have with us
for many, many years to come.

582
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,178
Ladies and gentlemen...

583
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:43,774
I take great pleasure in introducing
our master of ceremonies...

584
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:47,183
Honest John Jessup!

585
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:55,753
Mr. Warden.

586
00:42:55,828 --> 00:42:58,821
Ladies... and gentlemen.

587
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:02,664
I can scarcely find the words
to express my gratitude...

588
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:07,537
in having being selected as master of
ceremony for this delightful performance.

589
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:10,509
It is a very unusual compliment.

590
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:12,545
And now,
with your kind permission...

591
00:43:12,612 --> 00:43:17,573
I take infinite pleasure
in presenting that ever-popular team...

592
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,642
Black and Blue.

593
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,361
Come on there, Blue.
Let me ask you somethin' now.

594
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:35,958
You owe me some money,
and what I wanna know is...

595
00:43:36,035 --> 00:43:39,665
- when is you gonna pay me my money?
- Why, I pay you when you alone.

596
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:41,674
- When I'm alone?
- Mm-hmm.

597
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,108
- I'm alone now.
- No, you ain't. I'm here.

598
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,315
- What is that thing you got there?
- That's my bazooka.

599
00:43:51,384 --> 00:43:53,683
- But–
- Musical instrument.

600
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:57,019
Bazooka? You don't mean
to tell me you get music outta that.

601
00:43:57,089 --> 00:43:59,991
- Sure, I do.
- Let me see this thing.

602
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,022
That ain't nothin'
but an old piece of gas pipe.

603
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:11,264
- Yeah, but I makes my livin'
with that piece of gas pipe.

604
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:17,710
Yeah, but I play
good music on this thing.

605
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:19,712
Let me hear you
play something on it.

606
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:22,408
I'm just gonna play
the "St. Louis Blues" on this thing...

607
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:24,347
in honor of St. Louis.

608
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:25,370
I'll be seeing you.

609
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:27,837
Go ahead, mister. Will
you play it for me?

610
00:46:20,663 --> 00:46:23,633
Gee, those guys are swell!

611
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,067
Oh, we certainly knocked them
cold out there tonight.

612
00:46:26,231 --> 00:46:29,360
- Boy, they're laughin' out there yet.
- Mi, mi, mi-mi-mi-mi.

613
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:32,885
Mi, mi, mi.

614
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:37,298
Come on, kid.
Knock 'em in the aisles. You're a cinch.

615
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,529
- They're a pushover.
- Gee, but I'm scared.

616
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:42,072
Go on out and look 'em in the eye
and sing, kid.

617
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:44,073
They can't walk out
on you anyway, kid.

618
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:18,241
Well?

619
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:20,389
Well, I ain't goin' through
with it, I tell you.

620
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:23,406
Now, listen.
I never break my word.

621
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:27,233
And I gave my word to Judy. And we're goin'
to New England, and we're goin' tonight.

622
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:30,109
I can't go to New England, not tonight.
I'm in the finale.

623
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,115
<i>- Oh, what's the use, St. Louis?</i>
- Say, listen.

624
00:48:32,182 --> 00:48:34,913
If you don't do like I tell you,
it's gonna be your finale.

625
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:37,853
All right, I'll go.
What's that got to do with the act?

626
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:41,119
- It's part of my plan, you sap.
- Oh.

627
00:48:41,191 --> 00:48:43,990
- What do I do when I get on the stage?
- You just stand there.

628
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,462
- Don't I sing or dance or do nothin'?
- Yeah. You do nothin'.

629
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,523
I'm gettin' smart.
There's somethin' screwy about this.

630
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:55,435
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
our next act will hardly need an introduction.

631
00:48:55,505 --> 00:48:59,067
Allow me to present
St. Louis and Company.

632
00:49:07,617 --> 00:49:09,552
Thanks very much.

633
00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:12,998
Ladies and gentlemen, they've asked me to do
my little bit for the entertainment tonight.

634
00:49:13,068 --> 00:49:16,300
I can't sing, and I can't dance.
But I'll tell you what I will do.

635
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:20,832
I'll do an act that I used to do when I was
a little kid and ran away with the circus.

636
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:26,206
This is a knife-throwing act,
and I use a human target.

637
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:29,718
And the gentleman that's kindly
consented to act as my target tonight...

638
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:34,189
is none other than my old
partner and pal, Dannemora Dan.

639
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:42,658
Right over there, Danny.

640
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,035
Right over there.

641
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:04,683
Listen, you guys wanna be quiet out there.
I gotta have absolute quiet.

642
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:10,017
Are all the lights in this theater controlled
from that switchboard right there?

643
00:50:10,158 --> 00:50:13,394
<i>- That's right, sir.</i>
- Thanks very much.

644
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:16,035
- Throw a little more light on Danny's head.
<i>- All right, sir.</i>

645
00:50:21,537 --> 00:50:24,837
Listen, you wanna remember that
I haven't done this act for a long time.

646
00:50:24,907 --> 00:50:27,934
I'm liable to make a few slips.
You've got to overlook that.

647
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,674
I'll do my best though to go through
the act without any serious injury.

648
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,552
Now, Danny, Danny–

649
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,530
He missed him!

650
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:36,498
<i>Quiet, quiet. Everybody, now</i>–

651
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:39,939
Quiet, now. Quiet, boys.
Every man stay in his own place.

652
00:52:40,008 --> 00:52:41,943
No commotion, please.

653
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,143
Miss Massey, will you leave
by the side door?

654
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:45,990
Joe, open that door.

655
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:29,614
Thanks, boys. Thanks.
I'm proud of you.

656
00:53:29,691 --> 00:53:32,354
Come on, boys.
Give the warden a great big cheer.

657
00:53:36,598 --> 00:53:39,693
- I guess they made it.
- Yeah.

658
00:54:26,398 --> 00:54:31,029
Frosby. You'd tell everybody
that I was an ex-convict.

659
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,903
But now that you've started
to swindle my mother–

660
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:33,748
Swindle?

661
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:36,581
She told me all about you. She told me
about every crooked deal you ever pulled.

662
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:40,140
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to get out of town.

663
00:54:40,438 --> 00:54:42,271
Well, I won't get out of town.

664
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:46,011
And I'll tell your mother that you
weren't in China– that you were in jail.

665
00:54:46,084 --> 00:54:49,646
- An ex-convict!
- You'd do that?

666
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:54,921
Well, you won't have to,
because I'll tell her myself.

667
00:54:54,993 --> 00:54:58,191
- Now, listen, you little jailbird–
- All right, I am a jailbird!

668
00:54:58,263 --> 00:55:00,664
But in jail, I learned how
to handle crooks like you!

669
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:02,940
You've been threatening me!
Now, I'll threaten you!

670
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:05,833
If you don't get out of this town
by tonight, I'll kill you!

671
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:08,740
We're not intruding, are we?

672
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:10,776
Oh, no, not at all, gentlemen.

673
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:15,246
Would you sit down?
Our business can wait.

674
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,477
Glad to know you, Mr.Jones.

675
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,732
<i>Well, what can I do for you?</i>

676
00:55:19,757 --> 00:55:22,033
I wanted to have a little
business talk with ya.

677
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:24,750
Well, you'll have to make it pretty short,
because he's leaving town.

678
00:55:24,823 --> 00:55:26,803
That's too bad. I'll see you
when you come back.

679
00:55:26,828 --> 00:55:27,715
He won't be back.

680
00:55:27,759 --> 00:55:30,285
Oh. Well, that's–
that's tough.

681
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,229
Oh, say, by the way,
which is the best hotel in town?

682
00:55:33,298 --> 00:55:36,268
Well, there isn't any best.
They're all terrible.

683
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,599
But I'd like very much
to have you stay at my house.

684
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,662
Oh, no. I don't wanna
put you to all that trouble.

685
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:48,670
Why, it won't be any trouble at all.

686
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:53,013
Really, I'd like to have you
meet my mother and my sister.

687
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:55,553
Give you a nice room,
and put him in the garage.

688
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,953
- Swell.
- And I know how you traveling men...

689
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,957
like to get a good home-cooked meal.

690
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:03,483
Ah, boy, now you're talkin'. Say,
I haven't had a home-cooked meal in year–

691
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,292
Uh, it's been quite some time now.

692
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,299
Okay, then.
Suppose we go right over?

693
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:10,358
Fine and dandy.
Come along there, brains.

694
00:56:10,435 --> 00:56:12,631
There are millions
to be made in this stock.

695
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:15,139
Wrap that up and save it for me.
I'll be back later.

696
00:56:15,206 --> 00:56:20,304
<i>Frosby, be down at the train
tonight to make sure you don't miss it.</i>

697
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,313
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.

698
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:36,259
Say, listen, Frosby,
what are you trying to do?

699
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,225
Huh?

700
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,958
Those two guns from New York–
What about them?

701
00:56:40,336 --> 00:56:42,498
I never saw them before.

702
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:45,369
Say, have you got some new game
you're not gonna cut us in?

703
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:46,646
Now, listen, cutie.

704
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:50,498
- As long as you're as pretty as you are–
- Oh!

705
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:54,239
Listen, if you even try
to double-cross us...

706
00:56:54,312 --> 00:56:56,543
you know what will happen to you.

707
00:56:56,614 --> 00:57:00,210
Aw, shut up!
Get out of my way! I'm busy.

708
00:57:11,196 --> 00:57:13,324
Come on in, fellas.

709
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,672
- Oh.
- Hello, Mother.

710
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,674
- Hello, dear.
- Say, listen, Mother...

711
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:26,119
I brought a couple of friends home
to spend the weekend with me.

712
00:57:26,211 --> 00:57:27,367
You don't mind, do you?

713
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,189
Oh, no, of course not.
Bring them right in.

714
00:57:29,214 --> 00:57:31,376
All right.
Come on in, boys.

715
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:35,153
Mother, I want you to meet Mr.–

716
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:36,517
Jones.

717
00:57:36,595 --> 00:57:39,773
Do you belong to the Salem Joneses
or New Bedford Joneses?

718
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,225
Well, I'll tell you, ma'am,
I come from New York State.

719
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,922
Yes, you see, and this is Mr.–

720
00:57:44,996 --> 00:57:47,488
- Dannemora.
- Oh.

721
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:49,898
- Say, where's baby?
- Danny Mora. I think she's upstairs.

722
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:52,802
Hello, Sis. Sis, I want you
to meet a couple of friends of mine.

723
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,271
This is my sister.
This is Mr.Jones and Mr. Mora.

724
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,366
- How do you do? How do you do?
- Thank you.

725
00:57:57,442 --> 00:58:02,881
Now, come right in, children,
and make yourselves perfectly at home.

726
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:05,507
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.

727
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,518
- You sit here, will you?
- Thank you very much.

728
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:12,489
I'll take your hat. And I'll take your hat.
You can sit right here.

729
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:15,493
I hope you'll make yourselves
perfectly at home.

730
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,587
And you may smoke if you like.

731
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,598
Steve smokes.

732
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:24,432
I caught him once smoking corn silk
when he was a little boy.

733
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,437
Gee, Steve, that was wrong.

734
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:29,440
Well, anyway, he's grown up
to be a fine young boy.

735
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:31,738
I'll help Sophie get supper.

736
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:35,712
- Could I help you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, thank you, dear. Sophie's here.

737
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:48,525
Gee, Steve, this is great.
This is swell.

738
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:50,528
Boy, your mother and–
This is great.

739
00:58:50,595 --> 00:58:54,999
Do you like our home?

740
00:58:55,066 --> 00:58:57,797
Sure.
And your mother's nice.

741
00:59:17,622 --> 00:59:20,114
Pretty.

742
00:59:20,446 --> 00:59:23,814
Who's his nobs here, your father?

743
00:59:23,883 --> 00:59:26,580
Oh, no.
That's Abraham Lincoln.

744
00:59:26,652 --> 00:59:28,587
Oh.

745
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:32,455
Is that him? I know.
The father of this country.

746
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:37,895
Come along, children.
Our dinner is served.

747
00:59:37,964 --> 00:59:40,195
Now, let me see.
How am I going to seat you?

748
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:42,428
Mr. Sterling dines with us
about once a month...

749
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:45,528
so I'll put our newest guest,
Mr.Jones, at my right.

750
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:47,540
- Thank you.
- And, Mr. Sterling, my left.

751
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:50,441
And I'll sit here.

752
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:52,876
Oh, thank you, dear.

753
00:59:57,617 --> 01:00:01,281
And, Mr. Mora,
you may sit next to baby.

754
01:00:04,023 --> 01:00:06,015
Thank you.

755
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:16,567
And now, Mr. Sterling,
will you say grace?

756
01:00:18,638 --> 01:00:22,166
Accept our thanks, O Lord,
for this food...

757
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:25,237
and bless it to our use
for thy namesake–

758
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:26,454
Amen.

759
01:00:32,184 --> 01:00:35,780
I think I'll take these flowers off.

760
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:41,556
Daffodils are lovely this time of year,
but they're in the way.

761
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:43,619
- Thank you, dear.
- You're welcome.

762
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:46,461
I hope you'll enjoy
your supper, children.

763
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,467
It's a very simple one.

764
01:00:48,534 --> 01:00:50,799
Our regular Saturday night meal.

765
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:56,138
But no one in the country can cook them
as we New Englanders do.

766
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,803
Boston beans.

767
01:00:58,878 --> 01:01:03,942
- Well, that's– that's splendid.
- Thank you.

768
01:01:04,016 --> 01:01:06,415
I'm so sorry Mr. Frosby
couldn't come tonight.

769
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,238
Frosby?

770
01:01:07,286 --> 01:01:11,621
Yes. I invited Mr. Frosby to come
and have supper with us, but he couldn't.

771
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:14,718
Marvelous stock
he's offering for sale.

772
01:01:14,794 --> 01:01:17,764
It ought to enrich
many of our townspeople.

773
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:21,062
Mr. Sterling, I–
I don't know very much about stocks, but–

774
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:25,036
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't invest
in any stock until I'd consulted my banker.

775
01:01:25,104 --> 01:01:27,369
Are you going to invest much?

776
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,275
- Well, with my modest salary–
- Blessed are the poor in spirit.

777
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:33,312
For their's is the kingdom of heaven.

778
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:40,876
Hayride! Hayride!

779
01:01:40,953 --> 01:01:42,888
Oh!

780
01:01:42,955 --> 01:01:45,151
- We didn't know you had company.
- Oh, that's all right, dear.

781
01:01:45,224 --> 01:01:47,284
We're sorry if we're intruding.

782
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,056
Oh, no, you're not intruding.
Just a couple of friends for supper.

783
01:01:50,129 --> 01:01:52,792
- Oh, Steve, aren't you going?
- Going where?

784
01:01:52,865 --> 01:01:55,130
Well, your friends
are cordially invited...

785
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:58,000
to attend the third annual
hayride and dance.

786
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,063
- The choir leaders are giving it.
- You'd like to go, wouldn't you, boys?

787
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,132
- Sure!
- Where'd you put my hat?

788
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:05,178
Wait a minute.
There's plenty of time, Danny.

789
01:02:05,244 --> 01:02:08,214
Sit down, girls, and have a cup of coffee.

790
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,876
- Sophie, bring some coffee.
- Thank you.

791
01:02:19,191 --> 01:02:23,060
No, they don't have hayrides
in New York.

792
01:02:23,129 --> 01:02:25,530
<i>Sophie, hurry with the coffee!</i>

793
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:41,340
Helen, sing us a song.

794
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:35,886
Ah! Good evening, my dear boys.

795
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:39,557
- How do you do?
- Out in the night air, eh? Delightful.

796
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:44,297
Music and moonlight.
Well, enjoy them while you may.

797
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:47,135
It's always a pleasure
to see the young enjoy themselves.

798
01:04:47,206 --> 01:04:49,698
To some of us, that has been denied.

799
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:52,301
But– Ah, well.

800
01:04:52,378 --> 01:04:54,404
Ah. Good evening.
Good evening.

801
01:05:02,955 --> 01:05:05,447
What was Frosby doing here?

802
01:05:05,524 --> 01:05:09,859
Steve, I've just made
a wonderful investment...

803
01:05:09,929 --> 01:05:13,195
that will make you and your sister
independent for life.

804
01:05:13,265 --> 01:05:15,234
- You bought his stock?
- Yes, dear.

805
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:17,236
You gave him your bonds?

806
01:05:17,303 --> 01:05:20,068
- Why, yes. Why?
- Nothing.

807
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:22,199
Nothing.

808
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:25,039
Aw, Steve don't know
anything about business.

809
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:28,103
He don't know how
those things are done.

810
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,672
You know, Mother,
I think you'd better go to bed.

811
01:05:30,749 --> 01:05:33,480
You know, you had a hard day,
all those people here and everything.

812
01:05:33,552 --> 01:05:37,717
Oh.
Always the nice little gentleman.

813
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:40,919
I believe I will.
Come along, Cynthia dear.

814
01:05:40,993 --> 01:05:43,861
- Oh, Mother.
- Cynthia.

815
01:05:43,929 --> 01:05:47,263
Well, gee,
I had a lot of fun. Thanks a lot.

816
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:50,556
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, boys.

817
01:05:50,641 --> 01:05:51,329
Good night.

818
01:05:51,354 --> 01:05:53,392
Steve will show you where
you're going to sleep tonight.

819
01:05:53,434 --> 01:05:55,166
- Sure.
- Good night. Happy dreams.

820
01:05:55,233 --> 01:05:56,509
Good night.

821
01:06:12,124 --> 01:06:14,889
- Where are you goin'?
- You heard what I told that guy.

822
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,691
Not with that gat, you're not!

823
01:06:17,896 --> 01:06:20,278
You think I'm gonna stand
by and see him rob my mother?

824
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:21,583
Shh!

825
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,957
Give me that gun. Come on.
Get out of my way.

826
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,470
You'll wake up your mother.

827
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:31,007
Go on in there.
I wanna have a little talk with you.

828
01:06:45,357 --> 01:06:47,292
- Here's a cigarette.
- I don't want one.

829
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,351
Smoke it!

830
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:58,861
Now, Steve,
you gotta snap out of this.

831
01:06:58,937 --> 01:07:02,965
You're only a kid.
You're gonna marry Judy, ain't ya?

832
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:06,501
And you got a great home here,
and you got a wonderful mother.

833
01:07:06,578 --> 01:07:10,037
And just one shot out of that gat,
and you're gonna blow the whole works.

834
01:07:10,115 --> 01:07:12,050
- Well, you know what it means–
- Aw, forget it.

835
01:07:12,117 --> 01:07:16,077
Forget it, Steve.
It's a sucker's game.

836
01:07:16,155 --> 01:07:18,852
Nobody but chumps uses guns.

837
01:07:24,763 --> 01:07:27,358
Steve.

838
01:07:27,433 --> 01:07:30,301
Did you ever see a guy go to the chair?

839
01:07:30,369 --> 01:07:35,000
Huh?
Well, I did.

840
01:07:35,074 --> 01:07:37,634
I spent eight months
in that condemned row.

841
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:43,046
Watched 'em go one by one.
Pals of mine.

842
01:07:43,115 --> 01:07:45,414
Guys that you'd say
good morning to in the morning...

843
01:07:45,484 --> 01:07:47,885
and then you'd say
good night at night.

844
01:07:47,953 --> 01:07:50,582
And then they'd go.

845
01:07:50,656 --> 01:07:53,820
And I'd wait day after day,
week after week, month after month...

846
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:58,023
wonderin' if I was gonna
be the next one to go.

847
01:07:58,097 --> 01:08:01,363
Let me tell you,
that's no picnic, kid...

848
01:08:01,433 --> 01:08:06,428
listenin' to the drone of that lousy motor
and watchin' those lights go dim!

849
01:08:25,157 --> 01:08:28,855
Come on.
Don't be a sap.

850
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:32,155
What am I gonna do?

851
01:08:32,231 --> 01:08:35,167
Don't worry about Frosby.

852
01:08:35,234 --> 01:08:37,669
He'll be taken care of.

853
01:08:37,736 --> 01:08:40,467
<i>Well</i> taken care of.

854
01:08:40,539 --> 01:08:44,704
Say, what do you think Danny and I
come up here for, to go on hayrides?

855
01:08:44,776 --> 01:08:46,972
<i>Steve?</i>

856
01:09:05,397 --> 01:09:07,332
Yes, Mother?

857
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:10,927
<i>Aren't you going
to say good night to Mother?</i>

858
01:09:21,947 --> 01:09:23,939
Coming, Mother.

859
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:42,452
There you are, Steve.
There's the works.

860
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:46,458
- What's this?
- Your mother's bonds.

861
01:11:46,525 --> 01:11:49,201
- Why, say– Gee, fellas, I–
- Aw, that's nothin'.

862
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:51,194
- But, listen, I could–
- Aw, forget it.

863
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:52,686
Steve, we gotta scram.
We got a date.

864
01:11:52,764 --> 01:11:54,765
Besides, if you're seen
around here with us...

865
01:11:54,828 --> 01:11:57,495
it'll break your parole,
and you know what that means.

866
01:11:57,567 --> 01:12:00,969
And, Steve, we're gonna tell Judy
just exactly what you told us to tell her.

867
01:12:01,037 --> 01:12:05,532
- Word for word.
- Make her believe it, will ya?

868
01:12:05,608 --> 01:12:09,773
Steve, you're on the square
with Judy, ain't ya?

869
01:12:09,846 --> 01:12:11,974
You bet I am.

870
01:12:12,048 --> 01:12:15,212
That's all we wanted to know.

871
01:12:15,285 --> 01:12:17,914
Oh, and...

872
01:12:17,987 --> 01:12:21,583
here's a little–
little piece of poetry I–

873
01:12:21,658 --> 01:12:23,684
I copied out of a book.

874
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,661
Give it to her for me, will ya?

875
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:27,594
Why, Sure, Steve.
Sure.

876
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:31,226
Hey, that's our freight.

877
01:12:31,301 --> 01:12:34,066
Now, wait a minute.

878
01:12:34,137 --> 01:12:35,366
Nuts!

879
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,472
Don't forget, boys,
everybody on their toes.

880
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:50,350
This is a tough bunch of hombres and they
crave action, and you should see them slug.

881
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:53,715
Now, listen, fellas.

882
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:58,319
I've been in this can 40 years,
and my one ambition–

883
01:12:58,394 --> 01:13:00,693
- Is to get out.
- Oh, shut up!

884
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:04,495
No.
It's to win the–

885
01:13:04,567 --> 01:13:06,536
the Institutional Championship
three times.

886
01:13:06,603 --> 01:13:08,697
You won it twice already
and nearly copped it again last year.

887
01:13:08,771 --> 01:13:10,877
I would've too if my third baseman
hadn't sat down on me.

888
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:11,663
Sat down on you?

889
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,643
- Yes.
<i>- Electrocuted.</i>

890
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:15,679
Look out for his arm, will you?

891
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:17,680
And now, St. Louis
and that other gorilla...

892
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:20,581
have to walk out on me
just one week before this big game.

893
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,518
Now, here's what I want you
to do, fellas. I'm pretty old.

894
01:13:23,586 --> 01:13:25,817
I haven't got very far to go.

895
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:30,383
But I'd be the happiest guy in any jail
if I could cop this game today.

896
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,760
Now, will you go in and fight
and try to win for old Pop?

897
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:36,766
That's the way to talk.

898
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,802
Now, remember our slogan–

899
01:13:38,868 --> 01:13:43,169
From first base
to second base to third base, we roam.

900
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:46,835
Be it ever so humble,
there's no base like home.

901
01:13:46,909 --> 01:13:48,969
That's the place that counts–
home base.

902
01:13:49,045 --> 01:13:52,379
And remember who you're playin' with–
a bunch of crooks.

903
01:13:52,448 --> 01:13:55,145
No ethics.
Show 'em that you're gentlemen.

904
01:13:55,218 --> 01:13:57,847
<i>I want everything in this game
on the up-and-up.</i>

905
01:14:00,089 --> 01:14:03,526
Like needles!

906
01:14:03,593 --> 01:14:05,528
Go after those guys now!

907
01:14:29,585 --> 01:14:32,316
You know, St Louis,
what my ambition is?

908
01:14:32,388 --> 01:14:37,452
To ride on a real train
with towels and everything.

909
01:14:49,238 --> 01:14:52,697
In the distance,
one sees the gray walls and towers...

910
01:14:52,775 --> 01:14:56,906
of dear old Bensonatta.

911
01:14:56,979 --> 01:15:00,973
- Home again, pal.
- Yeah, and I'm glad to get back.

912
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:03,986
Now have you got that poem
for Judy, ya half-wit?

913
01:15:04,053 --> 01:15:06,579
Why, certainly.
I got it right here. There ya are.

914
01:15:47,997 --> 01:15:49,932
How are ya, Bill?
How's your team?

915
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:51,934
We'll give you a game, all right.

916
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:54,163
If our pitcher hadn't busted out,
you wouldn't have a chance.

917
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:56,172
- Oh, yeah?
- Good luck.

918
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,674
Same to you.

919
01:16:06,883 --> 01:16:10,217
Now, listen, fellas,
this game is gonna be on the square...

920
01:16:10,286 --> 01:16:12,221
and be gentlemen at all times.

921
01:16:12,288 --> 01:16:15,258
- Sure, sure. Where's your pitcher?
- There he is.

922
01:16:15,324 --> 01:16:17,259
- Oh, is this your pitcher?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

923
01:16:17,326 --> 01:16:19,554
Now, remember, the game's
gotta be on the up-and-up.

924
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:20,320
Okay.

925
01:16:20,363 --> 01:16:22,088
None of that, you know.
And none of that.

926
01:16:22,113 --> 01:16:22,686
No?

927
01:16:22,732 --> 01:16:25,497
- Not through the game.
- And none of this! See what I mean?

928
01:16:25,568 --> 01:16:29,403
- Where's your pitcher?
- Right here, buddy.

929
01:16:29,472 --> 01:16:31,703
Oh, uh, I've heard about you.

930
01:16:31,774 --> 01:16:33,709
- You just heard the rules, didn't ya?
- Sure.

931
01:16:33,776 --> 01:16:35,711
- None of that!
- Say, what's the idea?

932
01:16:35,778 --> 01:16:37,713
- And none of that!
- Come on! Leave him alone!

933
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:39,715
And none of that!

934
01:16:39,782 --> 01:16:41,717
- You don't have to show him that.
- No?

935
01:16:41,784 --> 01:16:43,719
- Didn't I tell you there was none of that?
- Sure!

936
01:16:43,786 --> 01:16:45,721
- And that?
- Well, how about this?

937
01:16:45,788 --> 01:16:47,778
Say, what's the idea?
Leave that bat alone!

938
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:49,340
Come on! Play ball, you guys!

939
01:16:49,392 --> 01:16:53,090
All right, everybody ready?
Good luck.

940
01:16:53,162 --> 01:16:55,495
- Come on!
- Lots of luck. Go right to it.

941
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:16,279
Over the fence.

942
01:17:16,352 --> 01:17:19,220
- I'll get that ball for ya, Warden.
- Oh, let me get it.

943
01:17:41,777 --> 01:17:43,837
Okay to come in?

944
01:17:57,426 --> 01:18:00,419
Good-bye, dear.

945
01:18:00,496 --> 01:18:02,431
Good luck.

946
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:23,447
St. Louis!
Hello, Danny.

947
01:18:25,588 --> 01:18:28,057
Gee, I'm sorry to see
you kids back here again.

948
01:18:28,124 --> 01:18:32,323
Oh, that's all right, kid. I told 'em
I'd be back, and I never break my word.

949
01:18:32,395 --> 01:18:35,388
Besides, I'll tell ya, it wasn't so much fun
out there as you might think.

950
01:18:35,464 --> 01:18:37,524
You know, travelin' around
by yourself all alone.

951
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,593
- Wasn't I with you?
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

952
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:43,765
Say, what are you gonna do, kid?

953
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:46,035
I don't know.

954
01:18:46,108 --> 01:18:48,043
I'll go back to the old racket,
I suppose.

955
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,017
No, no. No, no.
You won't go back to the old racket.

956
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:56,279
You're goin' right to New England.

957
01:18:56,352 --> 01:18:58,287
- New England?
- Sure.

958
01:18:58,354 --> 01:19:02,155
- Steve's waitin' for you.
- Steve's waitin' for me?

959
01:19:02,224 --> 01:19:05,092
Well, I'm tellin' ya he's waitin'–

960
01:19:05,161 --> 01:19:09,428
Listen, he gave us a message to give to you.
He– He told us to tell ya–

961
01:19:09,498 --> 01:19:12,662
What was that message
that he gave us?

962
01:19:12,735 --> 01:19:15,967
Well, he told us to tell you
all about the–

963
01:19:16,038 --> 01:19:19,805
the birds and the–
the lilacs–

964
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:23,744
you know, flowers–
and the-the blue skies...

965
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:28,342
and, uh, the love
what comes but once–

966
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:31,444
Well, the meat of the whole thing
is you're to go back to New England.

967
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,013
Yeah, yeah. Now,
what he's trying to tell you is this.

968
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:38,755
You know.
You know, the birds are singin'...

969
01:19:38,828 --> 01:19:41,161
and the– and the flowers...

970
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:44,462
and the river's kind of–

971
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:47,332
It's pretty, ain't it?
And it's all– It's–

972
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:49,986
Well, listen, here's the dough
for you to go back there with.

973
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,143
- I don't need it.
- Sure you do.

974
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:58,579
Them Chinese mannequin coats
cost a lot of jack.

975
01:19:58,749 --> 01:19:59,702
Chinese coats?

976
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:01,987
Why, certainly.
Steve's gonna take you to China.

977
01:20:02,018 --> 01:20:04,112
- We told you that, didn't we?
- Sure.

978
01:20:04,186 --> 01:20:06,951
Tokyo, Honolulu–
All them Chinese towns.

979
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,757
Say, are you kiddin'?

980
01:20:11,827 --> 01:20:14,228
<i>No.</i>

981
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:17,357
You mean Steve is...
really waitin' for me?

982
01:20:17,433 --> 01:20:20,801
Say, what the heck–
Listen, baby.

983
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:24,238
I am tellin' ya on my word,
and I never break my word.

984
01:20:24,306 --> 01:20:26,241
That's one thing
I'll say for the louse.

985
01:20:46,295 --> 01:20:50,232
Hey, Sam.
Now here's your big chance.

986
01:20:50,299 --> 01:20:51,971
We're gonna send you
in there to hit that ball.

987
01:20:51,996 --> 01:20:53,782
Do you think you can do it?

988
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:55,964
- Sure, Pop.
- That's a boy. Okay.

989
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:59,270
Now, listen. If ever you laid on
an apple in your life, lay on this one.

990
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:02,368
It's our only chance to win.
You'll do that for your old pals, won't you?

991
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:04,380
- Sure.
- All right. Do it for Pop.

992
01:21:04,447 --> 01:21:07,281
That's the boy.

993
01:21:07,349 --> 01:21:10,046
Hello there, Warden.

994
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:12,247
So you're the fellow
that never breaks his word?

995
01:21:12,321 --> 01:21:14,256
Oh, now, listen, Warden.
I'm sorry about that.

996
01:21:14,323 --> 01:21:17,350
But I had to leave in such a hurry,
I just couldn't say good-bye.

997
01:21:17,426 --> 01:21:19,486
You know that this
doubles your sentences, don't you?

998
01:21:19,562 --> 01:21:23,863
- All right, I'll redouble.
- Gee, that makes me 286 years.

999
01:21:23,933 --> 01:21:26,095
I won't need that.

1000
01:21:26,691 --> 01:21:29,969
- Take them to the cooler.
- Oh, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

1001
01:21:30,039 --> 01:21:33,032
Judy's gone, and we're
losing the ball game.

1002
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:36,238
- Huh? Yeah?
- That's right, Chief. Three runs behind.

1003
01:21:36,312 --> 01:21:38,247
Take 'em to the cooler.

1004
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:41,944
Send St. Louis and uncle Dan to the cooler
when we're losing the ball game?

1005
01:21:42,017 --> 01:21:43,952
Oh, now, listen, Warden.
You're not gonna do that.

1006
01:21:44,019 --> 01:21:47,285
With Jean and the gang waitin' for us
out there, we gotta win that ball game.

1007
01:21:47,356 --> 01:21:49,791
Look here, St. Louis.
Can I trust you and Dan...

1008
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:52,226
to go out to that diamond
without leaving us?

1009
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:54,525
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll give you my word...

1010
01:21:54,597 --> 01:21:56,532
and you know that
I never break my word.

1011
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:59,068
- No?
- Well, never twice in succession.

1012
01:21:59,135 --> 01:22:01,070
Take 'em to the cooler.

1013
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:05,108
After the game!

1014
01:22:07,843 --> 01:22:10,176
Why does a fireman
wear red suspenders?

1015
01:22:10,246 --> 01:22:12,738
To keep his trousers up.

1016
01:22:12,815 --> 01:22:15,307
Say, St. Louis, you know that fellow
McDowell on the other side?

1017
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:18,752
Now, don't give him a high ball.
Keep 'em down and close–

1018
01:22:18,821 --> 01:22:21,814
<i>I don't care if there was a rumble seat
on the car or if there wasn't!</i>

1019
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:24,451
If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't
be spendin' a month in the cooler!

1020
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:26,462
Will you shut up
about that rumble seat?

1021
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:28,464
Take that cigar out of your mouth.
You're in training.

1022
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:29,149
All right!

1023
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:30,949
And I'm tellin' ya,
there was a rumble seat.

1024
01:22:31,019 --> 01:22:33,386
I don't care.
Ever since I met you, I've been in trouble.

1025
01:22:33,502 --> 01:22:35,437
Yeah, well, you know,
you're no turning point–

1026
01:22:52,955 --> 01:22:55,550
<i>St. Louis! Say, what are you guys runnin'?</i>
