1...

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,475
Zero.

9
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,458
Narrator: Since the splitting of the atom

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,225
only a few decades ago

11
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:37,934
and through his god-given
genius of science,

12
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,309
Man at last has succeeded

13
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:42,309
in penetrating further and further

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,018
into the unknown vastness of space.

15
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:47,267
The Moon has become the launching base

16
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,183
for advanced exploration.

17
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,726
From this pivotal point,

18
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:53,309
astronauts, at the risk of their lives,

19
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,183
set out to conquer
nature's mysterious forces.

20
00:00:57,183 --> 00:01:00,334
Yet many questions remained unanswered.

21
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:01,851
What is his Earth

22
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:06,099
in relation to the inconceivable
number of other worlds?

23
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,976
Is his speed truly the fastest,

24
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:11,099
his achievements the greatest,

25
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:14,309
or is he a mere unimportant
piece of driftwood

26
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:18,142
floating in the vast ocean of the universe?

27
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:20,459
Could there be life similar to our own

28
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:21,834
on other planets?

29
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,350
Is it not possible

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,959
that atmospheric conditions
of relative environments

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,718
control their shapes and forms?

32
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:32,976
If so, would they be giants,

33
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,350
or could perhaps the opposite be true?

34
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,667
Could their intellect have
reached a scientific level

35
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,475
far above man's dreams?

36
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:45,099
What, then, will the future reveal

37
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,142
if this story you are about to witness

38
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:51,601
is only the beginning?

39
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,059
Log entry.

40
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,934
Pegasus III.

41
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:12,351
March 16, 1980.

42
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:13,809
Captain Leonard, pilot.

43
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:15,850
Lieutenant Webb, navigator.

44
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,101
This is the seventh and last day

45
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:20,434
of space reconnaissance research,
Flight 361

46
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,300
for United States Air Force Lunar Base 1.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,599
We are 21,000 miles from base,

48
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,975
bearing at 2-7-0 degrees,

49
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,725
2-3 minutes.

50
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:37,892
Azimuth at plus 46 degrees,

51
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,599
4-6 degrees,

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,518
5-0 minutes ecliptic.

53
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:46,934
On routine successive approximation

54
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:47,934
by trajectory computer

55
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,099
using data from the
space position recorder.

56
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,059
It's quiet and lonely out here,

57
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:56,683
and frankly,

58
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:59,301
we'll be happy to get back
to that dreary old Moon.

59
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,184
We're almost a degree
off trajectory, captain.

60
00:03:08,184 --> 00:03:09,599
The equipment check's ok.

61
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,200
Must be an outside acceleration force.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,809
Something approaching fast!

63
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:24,059
I'm setting up auto-evasive pattern.

64
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,599
A large planetoid object

65
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,184
is on a direct collision course with us.

66
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,992
We are under 11 Gs exterior acceleration

67
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:33,459
and have no control whatsoever.

68
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,476
Captain!

69
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:50,392
We're gonna hit!

70
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,476
Ahhh!

71
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,142
It's just incredible.

72
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:49,434
Two ships missing in less than a month.

73
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,226
Nothing within thousands of miles

74
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,351
of their positions,

75
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,600
and yet they crash into something

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,559
that appears suddenly on our radar

77
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,850
big enough to be a planet,

78
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,767
and then the next instant, it disappears.

79
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,392
It's against all theories of space.

80
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:04,142
You get the same reports
from Bases 2 and 3?

81
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,700
It appeared for a second or two,

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,518
then vanished completely.

83
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:09,599
A ship is on a routine flight...

84
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:12,642
controls, rockets, everything in order...

85
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,609
and then all of a sudden...

86
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:17,599
Yes?

87
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,501
Woman on radio: General Gibson

88
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,718
for Colonel Lansfield

89
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:21,201
from Earth Headquarters.

90
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,592
Stand by.

91
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,199
Colonel Lansfield.

92
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,309
Gen. Gibson: Lansfield,

93
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:26,767
what's all the trouble up there?

94
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,799
General, I can't tell you any more

95
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,392
than what was in that report this morning.

96
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,267
You're certain the rockets crashed?

97
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,042
I am. We have their last log entry

98
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,392
through our recording reproduction unit.

99
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:40,351
Now, general,
I've listened to it over and over.

100
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,683
It tells what happened,

101
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:44,017
but not how and why.

102
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,599
What do you suggest?

103
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,683
I don't know, general.

104
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,599
No doubt the rocket's destroyed.

105
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:50,309
We don't know what we're looking for.

106
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,492
This mysterious planet seems to come and go

107
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,934
at such speeds, it's impossible to track.

108
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,392
A phantom planet, Lansfield?

109
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:00,809
You're a little old to
think that, aren't you?

110
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,399
This is a capable base, general,

111
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,599
run by capable men.

112
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,826
Now, there's something out there

113
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:06,300
that isn't supposed to be.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,599
All right, all right. Take it easy.

115
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,599
Send another reconnaissance with Chapman.

116
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,184
Chapman? I need him for the Mars project.

117
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,359
If this phantom planet
thing isn't cleared up,

118
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,642
there won't be any Mars project.

119
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:20,242
Send him!

120
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:20,851
Yes, sir.

121
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:23,592
Ask Chapman to report.

122
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,426
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:26,099
Captain Chapman,

124
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,309
report to the Colonel.

125
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,599
Sir, I've been testing
the pressure equipment

126
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:41,683
for the Mars project.

127
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,167
Forget about that now, Chapman.

128
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,309
You leave tomorrow morning.

129
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,309
The general wants someone
with your experience.

130
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:49,017
I don't know whether
to feel flattered or not.

131
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,683
What exactly will I be looking for,

132
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,299
a floating space monster?

133
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,001
This is no joke, Frank.

134
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,017
I wish it were.

135
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:57,934
Sorry, sir.

136
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,101
You know how rumors move around this base.

137
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:01,099
Well, that's one of the things

138
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,800
we hope that you'll dispel.

139
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,518
Well, you're the Colonel.

140
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,499
I'll take a crack at anything once.

141
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,509
And that's about all you'll get, Frank,

142
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:12,617
one crack.

143
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:29,199
18,000 miles out at 2-7-0
degrees azimuth

144
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,308
and 4-7 degrees ecliptic.

145
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:35,825
Speed... 4.6 miles per second.

146
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:36,533
Check.

147
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,782
Computer guidance on.

148
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,692
Stability course on.

149
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:42,683
Directional rockets port, off.

150
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,599
Directional rockets starboard, off.

151
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,142
Check the automatic.

152
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,142
Check.

153
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,351
Well, that does it, captain.

154
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,683
We can relax a bit now.

155
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,850
Takeoff's always the same.

156
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,559
My heart pounds like a sledgehammer.

157
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,600
Yeah, mine too.

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,017
How about the screen?

159
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:08,809
Never fails to fascinate me from up here.

160
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,199
You know, captain,

161
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,809
every year of my life,

162
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,059
I grow more and more convinced

163
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,309
that the wisest and best

164
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,600
is to fix our attention on the good

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,400
and the beautiful.

166
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,434
If you'll just take the time to look at it.

167
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:25,767
You're some guy, Makonnen.

168
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,017
Woman on radio: Lunar Base 1 to Pegasus IV.

169
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:31,476
Lunar Base 1 to Pegasus IV.
Can you read me?

170
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,683
This is Pegasus IV to Lunar Base 1.

171
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:36,850
This is Lieutenant Makonnen.

172
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,599
Colonel Lansfield for Captain Chapman.

173
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,599
Chapman standing by.

174
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,850
Lansfield on radio:
Anything out there, Frank?

175
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,683
Nothing, Colonel.

176
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:48,101
It's almost too quiet.

177
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,059
Well, keep alert

178
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,683
and don't waver off your course one degree

179
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:52,599
unless you think you're onto something.

180
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:54,476
And if you do get onto something,

181
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:55,725
report at once.

182
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,518
Chapman on radio: Yes, sir.

183
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:59,101
Pegasus IV to Lunar Base 1,

184
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,934
Over. Out.

185
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,009
I hope whatever was out there is gone now.

186
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,776
What's our elapsed time from base?

187
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:16,726
14 hours, 22 minutes, and 30
seconds.

188
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:19,026
We could stay up here
another fourteen hours

189
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,851
and still see nothing.

190
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,601
Even fourteen hundred hours.

191
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,267
It's about all we can do, though.

192
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:27,225
Are you sure we're still on course?

193
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:28,434
Why?

194
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,183
Well, I have an idea.

195
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:33,350
Turn to 2-7-8 degrees azimuth,

196
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,099
0-47 degrees ecliptic.

197
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,059
Yes, sir.

198
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,559
Changing course to 2-7-8 degrees azimuth,

199
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,701
hold 4-7 degrees ecliptic.

200
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,099
Lansfield tells us to
charter the same course

201
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,642
Pegasus III took.

202
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:48,684
Well, that's fine,

203
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,892
but I don't think we'll get anywhere.

204
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,099
if this strange planet dashes about

205
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,099
like it's supposed to,

206
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:56,434
it figures we won't find it around here,

207
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,309
so we're changing course.

208
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:01,267
Lightning never strikes
twice in the same place.

209
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,099
Precisely. You with me?

210
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,475
Like I said, you're the captain.

211
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,799
I'll take a new reading.

212
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,899
Thanks, Ray.

213
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:22,875
Oh, you could go nuts out here

214
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,792
just waiting for something to happen.

215
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,559
You seem pretty much at ease.

216
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,934
Well, I figure it's just
the same as fishing.

217
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:34,999
You've got to be patient and wait.

218
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,309
Electrostatic meter is going haywire.

219
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,325
Woman on radio:
Lunar Base 1 to Pegasus IV.

220
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,851
Can you read me? Over.

221
00:11:43,851 --> 00:11:45,434
Pegasus IV to Lunar Base 1,

222
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:47,142
we read you. Over.

223
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:49,851
You are completely off course, Pegasus IV.

224
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:52,684
Check your position immediately.

225
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:55,350
The computer and spectrometer...out.

226
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,242
Pegasus IV to Lunar Base 1.

227
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,767
We are aware of being off course.

228
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:01,099
Cannot explain at present.

229
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:03,684
We are entering a heavy magnetic field.

230
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:04,659
Several instruments are out,

231
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,176
and I'm afraid others are going.

232
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,692
Give us our exact position.

233
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:09,925
Over.

234
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,699
Pegasus IV, you're...

235
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,899
Cannot hear you, Lunar Base 1.

236
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,800
Over.

237
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,342
Changing to manual control.

238
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,351
Meteors!

239
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,476
Boy, that was close.

240
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:36,199
Yeah and I'm afraid it isn't over yet.

241
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,675
We're in a semi-closing course with them.

242
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,226
Screen one's fading fast.

243
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,059
What about the infrared detector?

244
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:51,092
That's out, too.

245
00:12:51,092 --> 00:12:52,992
The only thing we can
do is turn it 9-0 degrees

246
00:12:52,992 --> 00:12:54,509
to the shower's path.

247
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,551
More meteors are coming.
It's our only chance.

248
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:00,259
That will be to 3-1-1 degrees azimuth

249
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,776
and minus 1-2 degrees ecliptic.

250
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:08,600
Here they come.

251
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,609
This is it.

252
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,226
Looks like the worst is over.

253
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:27,600
Still see a lot of spots.

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,017
Those are ionized trails.

255
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:30,184
They'll persist for a while.

256
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,767
Well, let's hope there are no stragglers.

257
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,559
With these instruments out,

258
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,799
there won't be any way to tell

259
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,017
if they're coming from another direction.

260
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,451
The trick now is to get back to the Moon.

261
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:43,059
I think we'll make it.

262
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,083
Yeah.

263
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:46,383
Ok, Ray,

264
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:47,499
let's go through a Type-B check.

265
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:48,509
Right.

266
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,309
Cabin pressure?

267
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:52,600
Twenty, coming up.

268
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,599
Retro port?

269
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,467
Positive.

270
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,599
Retro starboard?

271
00:13:58,699 --> 00:13:59,850
Positive.

272
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,142
Main circuit one?

273
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,892
Negative.

274
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,642
Main two?

275
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:10,599
Negative.

276
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,909
Let's try the auxiliaries.

277
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:14,934
Main one?

278
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:17,683
Negative.

279
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:18,699
Main two?

280
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,309
It's not in the circuits?

281
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:28,001
Ya know, the meteors must have
smacked into the propulsion elements.

282
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:29,600
Or feed lines.

283
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,518
Yeah, if we're lucky.

284
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:34,092
Well, there's only one way to find out.

285
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:35,999
Looks like it.

286
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,599
You know...

287
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,142
there's one thing sure.

288
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:45,267
What's that?

289
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,199
They knew what they were doing

290
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,192
when they forced us to go through

291
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,199
those space drills dozens of times.

292
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,350
If I remember correctly,

293
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,976
you had a different opinion.

294
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,659
Hey, don't rub it in.

295
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,467
Ray: This looks like it.

296
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,899
The retrorocket feed lines must be cut.

297
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,059
Frank!

298
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,684
Your air line is broken!

299
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,599
Frank!

300
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,309
Our father, who art in heaven,

301
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:55,859
hallowed be thy name...

302
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,684
With all respect to the Colonel, sir,

303
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:04,959
I don't think it's any use.

304
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:06,999
Keep working that radar,

305
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,392
and keep working it
until we locate Chapman.

306
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:10,159
Yes, sir.

307
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,699
He's got to be out there somewhere.

308
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,050
He just has to be.

309
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,392
Ray?

310
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,276
Ray?

311
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:58,983
Lieutenant Makonnen?

312
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,742
Oh, no.

313
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,476
This is Captain Frank Chapman,

314
00:19:35,476 --> 00:19:37,599
pilot, Pegasus IV.

315
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,159
My ship is being drawn toward an asteroid.

316
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,851
Instruments completely out of operation.

317
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,125
Navigator Makonnen...

318
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:48,918
Lost.

319
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:52,084
I cannot read my position.

320
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,059
I'm going to try to land,

321
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,059
but I don't think I'll make it.

322
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,599
If I do, I'll continue recording.

323
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,534
We seem to be entering
a heavy magnetic field.

324
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:20,599
Some of the instruments are out

325
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,667
and others are going.

326
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:22,775
Meteors!

327
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,425
You're completely off course, Pegasus IV.

328
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:26,742
Check your position immediately.

329
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:28,799
Lunar Base 1 to Pegasus IV.

330
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,642
Can you read me?

331
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:32,392
Frank! Your air line's broken!

332
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,850
Navigator Makonnen.

333
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,101
Ray. Ray.

334
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,018
Lieutenant Makonnen.

335
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,209
I'm going to try to land.

336
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:40,883
What exactly will I be looking for,

337
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:43,399
a floating space monster?

338
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,026
This is no joke, Chapman.

339
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:46,434
I wish it were.

340
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,809
Look, look.

341
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,059
His helmet is open.

342
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,399
The giant is getting smaller.

343
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,834
Will he become our size?

344
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,867
Let's go in and get him.

345
00:25:58,867 --> 00:25:59,934
Wait.

346
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:01,142
He may have a weapon.

347
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,459
He should stand trial.

348
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,101
We must take him to Sessom.

349
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,809
We will begin the trial.

350
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:37,959
Yes, Sessom.

351
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:47,683
Thank you, Sessom.

352
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,201
Bring in the jurors.

353
00:26:58,975 --> 00:27:00,734
Will Ypsilatis step forward?

354
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,017
Call the prisoner.

355
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,334
Bring in the prisoner.

356
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,017
Stand here,

357
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:40,042
in front of our leader and our judge.

358
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:44,883
Is the prisoner from another world

359
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:47,175
ready to hear the charges against him?

360
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:49,559
Charges?

361
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,101
What charges?

362
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:53,599
I will ask the questions.

363
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:56,184
Are you ready to stand trial?

364
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:58,599
It seems I have no choice.

365
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,183
But first I want to know
what I'm charged with.

366
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,850
We'll let you know in time.

367
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,599
What are you called?

368
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,892
Chapman.

369
00:28:09,892 --> 00:28:11,126
Frank Chapman.

370
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,434
What is your occupation

371
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:13,809
in the world from which you come?

372
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:15,518
I'm a captain in the Air Force

373
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:16,767
of the United States,

374
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,026
a country on Earth...

375
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:19,409
Space Exploration Wing.

376
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:22,850
But you must know about us.

377
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,099
You speak our language.

378
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,417
We do not speak it,

379
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:29,309
but here on Rayton...

380
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,599
Rayton?

381
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,309
Yes, Rayton,

382
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:34,309
the name of our planet.

383
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,518
Here we are able to translate all languages

384
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:39,934
through voice tone waves.

385
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:42,267
Why all these explanations?

386
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,276
Let us go on with the charges.

387
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:45,599
You're right, Herron.

388
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,592
This is no time for explanations.

389
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:50,476
Man from Earth,

390
00:28:50,476 --> 00:28:53,599
you are accused of causing injury

391
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,017
to one of our people.

392
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:57,399
I thought I was being attacked

393
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:58,884
and I defended myself.

394
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:02,767
I didn't want to come to your world.

395
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,892
I lost control of my ship.

396
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:07,800
It was like being pulled toward your planet

397
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,799
by an enormous gravitational force.

398
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,759
You were...

399
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,117
when you came into our path of travel.

400
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:15,983
Path of travel?

401
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:20,617
Phantom planet.

402
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:24,683
We managed just in
time to control your landing

403
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:28,076
by releasing the pressure
in our space warp.

404
00:29:28,076 --> 00:29:29,299
I don't understand.

405
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:33,292
There are many things
you will not understand here.

406
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:36,234
Maybe in time, you shall.

407
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:37,999
In time?

408
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:39,492
That is correct.

409
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:41,599
The jury will now vote

410
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,434
and find you guilty or not guilty

411
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:48,317
for inflicting injury on a Rayton man.

412
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,099
The verdict, judge.

413
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:16,242
I find you guilty as charged.

414
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:20,517
You are now a free subject of Rayton.

415
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,183
The jury is dismissed.

416
00:30:23,183 --> 00:30:25,225
That is all.

417
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:28,767
You are now a free subject of Rayton.

418
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,099
That is not all.

419
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:32,267
Listen, I don't know
what kind of a place this is,

420
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,099
but you must have some kind of law here.

421
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,099
This planet pulled me to it.

422
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,018
I didn't come here by choice.

423
00:30:38,018 --> 00:30:39,434
But being here,

424
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:42,475
you cannot be permitted to leave.

425
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:46,099
We must keep our security at any cost.

426
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:50,309
So, I must pronounce you guilty.

427
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:54,434
No penalties will be lodged against you,

428
00:30:54,434 --> 00:31:00,517
but you must become a subject of Rayton.

429
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,976
Trial is concluded.

430
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:04,099
Nothing is concluded.

431
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:04,767
What is this?

432
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:06,017
First I'm found guilty

433
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:07,099
of something that's not my fault,

434
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,417
and then I'm set free.

435
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:09,226
Well, free to go where?

436
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:10,975
Back to my world... six inches tall?

437
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:12,726
Don't worry.

438
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:14,517
No harm will come to you.

439
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:19,283
I'm Liara, Sessom's daughter.

440
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:21,459
I'll show you to your quarters.

441
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:24,199
Come. We'll talk on the way.

442
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,475
What has happened to me?

443
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,059
You mean your size?

444
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,599
Our atmosphere,

445
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,375
together with some acceleration

446
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,059
from our gravitational control,

447
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,467
has reduced you to normal.

448
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,242
-Normal?
-Normal for us.

449
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:44,909
You see, everything here

450
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:47,475
is in proportion to our planet's size.

451
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:49,301
We know several worlds

452
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:51,599
that have creatures larger or smaller,

453
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,150
according to the size of their world.

454
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,767
Do you feel any different?

455
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:57,825
No, but it's not exactly funny

456
00:31:57,825 --> 00:31:58,617
to think that someone on Earth

457
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,099
could carry me about in their pocket.

458
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:01,684
Oh, that would never happen.

459
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:04,201
You see, oxygen in your atmosphere

460
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:05,399
would restore you immediately

461
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,892
to your regular size.

462
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,099
But either way, it wouldn't matter.

463
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:12,442
You'll never see your world again.

464
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,892
Nothing yet?

465
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:27,099
No, sir. No contact for two days.

466
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:28,934
I'll wait another 24 hours.

467
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:30,601
Then with or without orders,

468
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,692
I'm sending out a search party.

469
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:38,499
You wanted to see me?

470
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,050
Yes.

471
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,983
Will you excuse me?

472
00:32:46,183 --> 00:32:49,225
We must talk about your future,

473
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:51,099
your future on Rayton.

474
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,517
My future on Rayton?

475
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:55,726
I want to talk about
getting back to my world,

476
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,059
back to Earth.

477
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,726
I'm afraid that is impossible.

478
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:02,309
You might as well accept your fate,

479
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:04,517
your fate of being one of us.

480
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:05,851
And being one of us,

481
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:09,099
you must be productive
in one way or another.

482
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,959
Well, what is it you want me to do?

483
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:13,909
You must help us to keep
spaceships from your world

484
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,009
from landing here.

485
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:18,517
But that's my only hope of getting back.

486
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:20,225
Forget about it.

487
00:33:20,225 --> 00:33:23,225
Two ships in my unit disappeared.

488
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:24,726
Did they crash here?

489
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:26,599
Unfortunately, yes.

490
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,584
They were pulled into our
strong gravitational field.

491
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:31,775
Well, so was I.

492
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:35,018
Yes, but luckily we were
aware of your approach

493
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:38,334
and lowered the power on our gravity field.

494
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,559
I don't get it.

495
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,059
In many ways, you're hundreds
of years ahead of our science.

496
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:46,892
Yet you live in such a primitive manner.

497
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:50,059
It may not be as odd as it seems.

498
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:52,576
It's true that our technology

499
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,959
may be much further advanced than yours,

500
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:58,100
but then a strange thing happened.

501
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,142
What was that?

502
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:01,099
We had machines do all our work.

503
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:05,709
People on Rayton became
completely free of all labor,

504
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:09,266
practically of all responsibilities.

505
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:12,375
Our people became soft and lazy.

506
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:15,641
They did not know how
to cope with their free time.

507
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:19,017
They started to fight amongst themselves.

508
00:34:19,018 --> 00:34:20,684
That's very interesting.

509
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:21,726
Many people on Earth

510
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,809
are beginning to face the same problem...

511
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:26,666
too much free time, too little work.

512
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:29,599
A problem not at all unique

513
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,634
in the history of the universe.

514
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,399
Well, what happened on Rayton?

515
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:36,526
Our forefathers then made a wise decision.

516
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:41,391
They returned to, as you say,
our primitive ways.

517
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:45,233
The Raytons again
had to toil for their living.

518
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:48,641
They became much stronger,

519
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:50,182
much happier,

520
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:51,976
much more valuable.

521
00:34:51,976 --> 00:34:53,099
But you didn't forsake

522
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,800
all of your scientific achievements.

523
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,442
No. We retained the
secret of the gravity control

524
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:00,392
for our survival in space

525
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,499
and the secret of our food production

526
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:06,284
for our survival on this barren planet.

527
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:10,099
You sacrificed advancement for this?

528
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,559
Sessom rules us, and we are content.

529
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,809
Now, can't we get on with this, Sessom?

530
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:18,976
Herron is hasty.

531
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:20,099
We all are.

532
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,517
Our lives have been changed so much.

533
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:28,099
I would like you to become
acquainted with our ways.

534
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:31,099
Later you may choose a wife,

535
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,799
Liara or Zetha.

536
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,892
Zetha cannot speak,

537
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:37,767
but she is a fine woman.

538
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,699
Well, between the two,

539
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,350
it would be difficult to make a choice.

540
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,767
It is no problem.

541
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,475
You may take your time.

542
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:50,517
But once you've made your choice, remember,

543
00:35:50,517 --> 00:35:53,892
it must not be taken lightly.

544
00:35:53,892 --> 00:35:55,267
You must be hungry.

545
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,183
Come with me.

546
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:58,267
Liara.

547
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:01,267
Go now and learn our ways.

548
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,517
Then, perhaps, you may
help us with our problems.

549
00:36:04,517 --> 00:36:06,809
You can decide about this later.

550
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,009
Now you need to eat and rest.

551
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,709
This is good.

552
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:28,776
What is it?

553
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:29,892
I think it's the equivalent

554
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,542
of your breadfruit.

555
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:32,892
We made it chemically for you,

556
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:35,267
since nothing grows here on this planet.

557
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:36,726
Oh, here.

558
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:38,059
Drink this.

559
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:39,099
It's good for you,

560
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,934
and it will help to make you rest.

561
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:42,099
You need it.

562
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,684
You say nothing grows here.

563
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:45,099
Then, how do you exist?

564
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:47,599
Well, our bodies are so constructed

565
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,976
that we need very little food,

566
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:51,076
because of the air we breathe.

567
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:55,242
Feeling better now?

568
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:57,967
I hope so.

569
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,142
Yes,

570
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:02,559
but I'd like to get out of here.

571
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,018
You're a strange one, Frankchapman.

572
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:08,350
I'm a strange one?

573
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:11,099
What about everybody else?

574
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,851
And don't call me Frankchapman.

575
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:15,392
My name is Frank Chapman.

576
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,459
Two words.

577
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:18,584
Yes.

578
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,099
Frank Chapman.

579
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:24,226
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be so rough.

580
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:26,167
It's just that, well, this is so new to me.

581
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:29,576
You know what I'd like
to do if I had a choice?

582
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:30,875
What?

583
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,901
I'd like to return to my ship.

584
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:35,767
Well, that's impossible.

585
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:37,976
Then you see, I'm still a prisoner.

586
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:38,767
Not at all.

587
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:42,392
You're free to go anywhere here on Rayton.

588
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,475
Except to my ship.

589
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:47,399
Your rocket is no longer on this planet.

590
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,726
It was sent off last night

591
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,299
while you were sleeping.

592
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:03,309
Frank on recorder:
I cannot read my position.

593
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:05,142
I'm going to try to land,

594
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:07,392
but I don't think I'll make it.

595
00:38:07,392 --> 00:38:10,483
If I do, I'll continue recording.

596
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:13,601
This is Captain Frank Chapman,

597
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:15,809
pilot, Pegasus IV.

598
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,767
My ship is being drawn toward an asteroid.

599
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:22,099
Instruments completely out of operation.

600
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,517
Navigator Makonnen...

601
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:25,575
Lost.

602
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:36,759
Sir! Unidentified object on-screen.

603
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:41,142
This must be Chapman's ship, Colonel.

604
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,059
It certainly has all the indications

605
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,159
and all the characteristics

606
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,451
of a spaceship,

607
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:46,418
and no other unit of ours

608
00:38:46,418 --> 00:38:48,251
is scheduled for flight in this area.

609
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,459
Any contact?

610
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:51,426
None, Colonel. Just static.

611
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:53,300
His auto-emergency transmitter

612
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,726
should be on full-blast.

613
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,467
I'm tuned to all Pegasus frequencies, sir.

614
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,675
So are the automatic relays on Earth.

615
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:02,099
Good. This must be Chapman's ship.

616
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,100
What else can it be?

617
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,642
Captain Beecher and Lieutenant White

618
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,592
are to report to the
briefing room immediately,

619
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:07,934
and stand by for takeoff.

620
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,617
Now, report immediately any news

621
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:10,567
or anything unusual

622
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:12,299
on your radio and radar relays.

623
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,600
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, Colonel.

624
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,100
The rescue ship is in
the countdown phase, sir.

625
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,999
They're waiting for your
final operation orders.

626
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,592
Put me through to the captain
of the rescue ship on launching.

627
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:30,599
Yes, sir.

628
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,059
Beecher, this is Lansfield.

629
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:35,999
Yes, Colonel?

630
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:37,567
Beecher, your final instructions

631
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,809
are being teletyped on your recorders.

632
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:41,099
Yes, sir.

633
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,592
As you know,
something unusual must have happened

634
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:46,192
to Chapman and Makonnen,

635
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:47,199
and I don't mind telling you

636
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,517
that it's of greatest importance

637
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:50,392
to space travel that we find out

638
00:39:50,392 --> 00:39:52,467
exactly what happened to these two men.

639
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:56,051
So, blast off, and good luck.

640
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,583
We'll do our best, Colonel.

641
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:27,942
Frank on recorder:
I cannot read my position.

642
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,275
I'm going to try to land,

643
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:31,242
but I don't think I'll make it.

644
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:34,999
If I do, I'll continue recording.

645
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,300
This is Captain Frank Chapman,

646
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,225
pilot, Pegasus IV.

647
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:45,083
My ship is being drawn toward an asteroid.

648
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:47,975
Instruments completely out of operation.

649
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:50,099
Navigator Makonnen...

650
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,999
Lost.

651
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,599
Pegasus IV to Lunar Base 1.

652
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
Pegasus IV to Lunar Base 1.

653
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,975
This is Captain Beecher. Over.

654
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:02,699
Woman on radio: Lunar Base 1

655
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:03,625
to Pegasus IV.

656
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:04,934
We read you, Captain Beecher.

657
00:42:05,034 --> 00:42:07,884
Good work. Stand by for Colonel Lansfield.

658
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:10,051
Lansfield on radio: Beecher, how are they?

659
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:10,976
They're not.

660
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:12,609
I mean, there's no one onboard.

661
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,850
There isn't a sign of life.

662
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,351
Two men don't just get
up and walk off a rocket

663
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:19,959
in the middle of space.

664
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:20,699
No, sir.

665
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,400
Then, what the devil?

666
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,559
Chapman recorded a final message, sir,

667
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:27,017
but it doesn't make sense.

668
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:29,359
Our repro units are picking it up.

669
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,409
We're examining it.

670
00:42:30,609 --> 00:42:31,659
Can you bring her in?

671
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,617
I'll have to check out the instruments,

672
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:35,809
but I think so.

673
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:36,899
All right. Give it a try.

674
00:42:36,899 --> 00:42:38,192
White can bring your ship in.

675
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,283
Yes, sir.

676
00:42:39,483 --> 00:42:41,209
And, Beecher...

677
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:42,099
Yes, sir?

678
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:42,983
Good luck.

679
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,299
I can't work under these conditions.

680
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:03,100
I must know more

681
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,976
about the directional flight machine.

682
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:06,183
When the time comes.

683
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,800
Well, the time has come.

684
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
I want to speak to Sessom,

685
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,434
and right now.

686
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:14,084
Very well.

687
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:27,099
Father.

688
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:30,099
Frank Chapman wishes to speak with you.

689
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:33,018
Do you want to talk about Liara?

690
00:43:33,018 --> 00:43:35,726
That isn't what I came here to discuss.

691
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,100
My work has reached a stage,

692
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,017
and I need to know more

693
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:39,526
about your gravity control.

694
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:43,392
It is too soon.

695
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:46,809
Now, how do we know he's
not a spy for the Solarites?

696
00:43:46,809 --> 00:43:49,476
You are too distrusting, Herron.

697
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:53,967
All right. You may see it.

698
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,350
It's incredible...

699
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,475
But how?

700
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:18,567
The high density of our planet

701
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:19,909
made it possible for us

702
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:21,459
to advance gravity...

703
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:24,767
and therefore anti-gravity theories.

704
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:26,099
It's beyond me.

705
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,225
Einstein was working on this problem,

706
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:30,975
but he died before he could
complete his investigations.

707
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:34,392
What causes Rayton's high density?

708
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:36,126
The atoms on this planet

709
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,499
have narrower electronic orbits

710
00:44:38,499 --> 00:44:40,292
than the atoms on most other planets.

711
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:42,099
The smaller they become,

712
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:44,792
the easier it is for us to control

713
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:45,959
and take advantage

714
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,976
of positive and negative gravity.

715
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,392
But why is Rayton getting smaller?

716
00:44:50,392 --> 00:44:53,634
This planet is slowly using up the energy

717
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:56,018
that holds the atomic particles together.

718
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:58,809
You mean you might
disintegrate into nothing?

719
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:01,099
Yes. Someday.

720
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,059
But it will not be in our time.

721
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:05,350
Well, I guess it's the same as on Earth.

722
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,559
We don't seem to worry

723
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,099
that our sun might be cooling off

724
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:09,384
in many millions of years.

725
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:10,684
No. The danger for us

726
00:45:10,684 --> 00:45:12,392
is that sudden bursts of concentrated heat

727
00:45:12,692 --> 00:45:14,601
directed on our Rayton

728
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:18,142
might suddenly speed
up the process of time.

729
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:19,309
You think that's possible?

730
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:22,399
We have enemies who
want our knowledge of gravity

731
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:24,183
and who know our weakness.

732
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:25,809
You're expecting attack?

733
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,099
When you have enemies

734
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,567
you always expect an attack.

735
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:55,734
Hello.

736
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,334
I'm going to take a walk.

737
00:46:12,934 --> 00:46:14,042
Will you join me?

738
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:16,934
Come on.

739
00:46:23,434 --> 00:46:25,009
You know, this is the first time

740
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:26,734
I've had a chance to talk to you alone.

741
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:49,183
How is it you're more different

742
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:50,275
than the others?

743
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,683
I don't mean your silence.

744
00:46:52,683 --> 00:46:55,683
I...I mean, you're warmer

745
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:58,767
and more sensitive.

746
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,809
That wasn't really a question,

747
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:03,683
because I know you can't answer.

748
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:05,599
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

749
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,667
Strange world.

750
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,767
I don't want to hurt Liara.

751
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,542
You don't, either, do you?

752
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,150
I like you.

753
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,726
I have charges to make

754
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:39,001
against the Earthman Chapman.

755
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,809
He is imposing himself

756
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:43,309
both on Liara... your daughter...

757
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:44,976
and the mute girl Zetha.

758
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:47,099
Now, this is an insult to Liara...

759
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,684
you know I love her...

760
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:51,099
and a direct insult to me.

761
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:53,099
I am asking... rather...

762
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:55,099
I am demanding your permission

763
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:57,017
to challenge him to the duel.

764
00:48:08,892 --> 00:48:10,225
You sent for me?

765
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:15,275
Yes. I have reports about
you that are not good,

766
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,350
that you're causing much trouble.

767
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,434
What am I supposed to have done now?

768
00:48:19,434 --> 00:48:22,099
You are forcing your attentions on Liara

769
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,851
and then on the mute girl Zetha.

770
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:24,999
That's not true!

771
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:25,767
Why don't you ask them?

772
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:26,399
He lies!

773
00:48:26,399 --> 00:48:27,475
Silence.

774
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:29,467
Is it true?

775
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:30,799
Has he forced himself

776
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:33,084
or his attentions upon you?

777
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:37,059
Why would she admit it?

778
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:39,099
Perhaps she's afraid of him.

779
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:42,142
Being mute, she's unable to defend herself.

780
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:45,059
Maybe she's protecting me.

781
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,309
Listen, I'm not going to be

782
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:47,534
put on trial or questioned

783
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:48,599
by you or anyone else

784
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,250
for something I haven't done.

785
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,350
You know, buddy, I don't like you.

786
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:54,099
Maybe it's a carry-over from Earth

787
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,142
and not good taste,

788
00:48:55,142 --> 00:48:56,699
but I'd like to hang one on you.

789
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:57,734
Chapman.

790
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:03,099
Herron has challenged
you to the duel of Rayton.

791
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,475
Do you accept his challenge?

792
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,099
A duel for what?

793
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:08,559
What kind of a duel?

794
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,100
This guy doesn't look very honest to me.

795
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,934
A duel of bravery.

796
00:49:15,934 --> 00:49:17,392
You know, Mr. Sessom,

797
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:20,099
maybe this duel business is a good idea,

798
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,517
might clear the air a little.

799
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:24,159
So how do we go about it?

800
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,559
Herron, you know the rules
for the duel of Rayton,

801
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,934
but for him, I'll have to explain

802
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,018
and show the results.

803
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,799
Chapman, come here.

804
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:48,309
Those are gravity plates
that we've had placed here.

805
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:50,159
Their intensity is so high

806
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:52,767
that any object or any person

807
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:55,434
placed on any one of them

808
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:58,475
would immediately disintegrate.

809
00:49:58,475 --> 00:49:59,934
Here, let me show you.

810
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,183
The duel of Rayton

811
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:23,350
is one of physical strength

812
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,899
and skill.

813
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:27,234
You will use this rod

814
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:30,099
and attempt to push your opponent

815
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:33,018
on top of one of the gravity plates.

816
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:35,684
You saw what happened to the rock.

817
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:41,525
Get ready.

818
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:49,551
Put the combat rod in position.

819
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:28,300
At my signal,

820
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,075
you will start the duel.

821
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:32,934
There can be no quarter called

822
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:35,351
and no quarter given.

823
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:36,842
The fate of the victim

824
00:51:36,842 --> 00:51:39,017
is in the hands of the victor.

825
00:51:39,017 --> 00:51:41,559
The moment has come.

826
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,226
At my light signal,

827
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:44,959
you will proceed.

828
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:31,599
Kill him! Kill him!

829
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:52,017
I don't want to kill you.

830
00:52:52,017 --> 00:52:53,709
I never did.

831
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:28,226
Why didn't you kill him?

832
00:53:28,226 --> 00:53:29,599
I didn't want to.

833
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,226
I don't believe in it.

834
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:32,518
In this case, killing him

835
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:33,600
would have accomplished nothing.

836
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,667
But Herron wouldn't
have shown you mercy.

837
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:38,642
He'd have killed you because he wants me.

838
00:53:38,642 --> 00:53:41,001
But I don't love him.

839
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:41,934
I love you.

840
00:53:42,434 --> 00:53:45,309
If you'd felt anything
for either one of us,

841
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,184
you could have stopped this duel.

842
00:53:47,184 --> 00:53:47,851
What?!

843
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:49,099
You know what I think?

844
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,517
I think you were waiting

845
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:51,584
to see which one of us won

846
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,375
and then take the one that was left over.

847
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:54,276
- Wha...
- No, Liara.

848
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:55,499
I don't love you.

849
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,659
I don't even know if I like you.

850
00:53:58,059 --> 00:53:59,892
But let me tell you this:

851
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:03,059
you can't make someone love you.

852
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,184
It's got to come naturally.

853
00:54:05,184 --> 00:54:07,199
You can't force it. You can't command it.

854
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,142
If you do that, you'll never find it.

855
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:14,476
This...this whole thing
is like a nightmare to me.

856
00:54:14,476 --> 00:54:15,876
I miss my people.

857
00:54:15,876 --> 00:54:18,683
So I've got to make
some attempt to get back,

858
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:20,734
and if you feel anything for me,

859
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:22,109
you'll try to help me.

860
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:25,967
Well, perhaps you're right.

861
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,799
Maybe I can help you.

862
00:54:57,017 --> 00:54:58,267
As you said,

863
00:54:58,267 --> 00:54:59,492
I don't want to kill you.

864
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:04,383
No, I think I could understand

865
00:55:04,383 --> 00:55:05,717
your somewhat quaint language

866
00:55:05,717 --> 00:55:07,309
if I were on your Earth a little.

867
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,309
Well, why don't you kill me?

868
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,699
You didn't kill me.

869
00:55:10,699 --> 00:55:11,892
You had the chance.

870
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,350
Well, what about the knife?

871
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,199
This isn't exactly what
I'd call a friendly visit.

872
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,599
If you help me,

873
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,659
I have a plan whereby I might
help you to leave our planet.

874
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:27,900
Perhaps it will work.

875
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,909
I don't see how this is possible.

876
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,559
What about my size?

877
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,434
I inspected your giant suit,

878
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:37,899
and the oxygen tank

879
00:55:37,899 --> 00:55:39,201
holds air from your own world.

880
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:40,376
Now, isn't that right?

881
00:55:40,376 --> 00:55:42,150
- Yes, of course, but...
- Oh, never mind that.

882
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,850
It's not important now.

883
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,017
You see, the whole plan
is based on the theory

884
00:55:47,017 --> 00:55:49,767
that your people are searching for you.

885
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,334
Now, I must get you back

886
00:55:51,334 --> 00:55:52,883
before they attempt to find you here.

887
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:54,392
I know they've been searching

888
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,483
and will eventually zero in on this planet.

889
00:55:57,683 --> 00:56:00,599
I think I can get you back in time.

890
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:01,875
Yes, but...

891
00:56:03,475 --> 00:56:06,859
you're doing this because
of Liara, aren't you?

892
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:09,351
Yes, I am.

893
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:10,699
I'm in love with her.

894
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,642
I don't think she loves me yet,

895
00:56:14,642 --> 00:56:17,475
but perhaps, with you gone,

896
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:18,259
she'll see things

897
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:19,799
in a more realistic light in time.

898
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:22,799
Now, how can we get my suit into the open?

899
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,009
I have some men I can trust.

900
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:26,318
And Sessom?

901
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:27,359
No.

902
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,599
He must never know.

903
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,599
Otherwise we both will be put to death.

904
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,559
Two nights a week, I'm alone,

905
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,500
in complete charge of
the master control center.

906
00:56:39,526 --> 00:56:40,350
Can one man handle it?

907
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,434
Yes,

908
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:43,359
and on one of those nights

909
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,083
in the near future,

910
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:45,826
while Sessom is sleeping,

911
00:56:45,926 --> 00:56:47,009
I will maneuver Rayton

912
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:49,083
within a distance of your Earth's Moon.

913
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:51,209
You think they'll be able to see us?

914
00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:52,317
Precisely.

915
00:56:52,517 --> 00:56:54,742
They will investigate and find you.

916
00:57:04,599 --> 00:57:05,518
Go with her.

917
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:12,434
What is this?

918
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:15,476
What's happening?

919
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:17,892
The siren means we're being attacked.

920
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,626
Attacked? By whom?

921
00:57:22,426 --> 00:57:23,809
Attacked by whom?

922
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:25,599
The Solarites.

923
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,942
We've been here too long.

924
00:57:26,942 --> 00:57:28,392
They've discovered our position.

925
00:57:28,392 --> 00:57:29,600
Who are the Solarites?

926
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,226
I've no time to explain.

927
00:57:31,226 --> 00:57:32,601
I must help Sessom.

928
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:36,999
What will this do to our plans?

929
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,009
We must fight this off,

930
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:41,434
or no one will have any plans.

931
00:57:41,434 --> 00:57:43,599
Is everyone underground?

932
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:44,834
Yes.

933
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:46,150
Then we go.

934
00:58:08,434 --> 00:58:10,518
We're safe for the moment,

935
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:13,683
but I fear they won't give up so easily.

936
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:15,392
Safe for the moment?

937
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:18,142
Well, who are these Solarites, anyhow?

938
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:20,599
They are from a Sun satellite.

939
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,501
For generations, they've been after

940
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:24,725
our universal gravity control,

941
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:26,226
because they want to avoid

942
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:27,599
being pulled into the Sun.

943
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,476
If we don't stop them,

944
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:33,599
they'll eventually attack your Earth.

945
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,059
Liara, show him the prisoner.

946
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:37,200
Chapman: Prisoner?

947
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,259
Come.

948
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:00,876
So that's a Solarite.

949
00:59:00,876 --> 00:59:04,159
Yes. He was captured during the last war...

950
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,659
the only one of their monsters
that didn't die in the attack.

951
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:09,192
When did this attack take place?

952
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:10,484
Several years ago,

953
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:12,317
when Zetha was a little girl.

954
00:59:12,317 --> 00:59:14,175
That's when she lost her voice.

955
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:18,992
What makes those rocks disintegrate?

956
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:22,909
It's as if they were hitting

957
00:59:22,909 --> 00:59:24,284
some invisible wall.

958
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:26,367
That's exactly what it is.

959
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:28,109
The monster is so strong

960
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:30,609
that he could smash any ordinary structure.

961
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,918
Now, what you call an invisible wall

962
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:34,099
is really another way

963
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,618
that we use our gravitational control.

964
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:39,183
By using a high magnetic field,

965
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:42,225
we can lock molecules so closely together

966
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:45,099
that they form a solid wall.

967
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:47,534
It would make a big hit at M.I.T.

968
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:48,699
Where?

969
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:50,999
One of Earth's more
advanced centers of learning.

970
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:52,409
Oh.

971
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:56,826
I only hope your wall
will hold him in check.

972
00:59:56,826 --> 01:00:00,492
Yes. He could kill us all if he escaped.

973
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:03,699
Life on other planets.

974
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:05,483
And we were always wondering

975
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:07,699
if ours was the only one so blessed.

976
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:10,117
There are many inhabited worlds,

977
01:00:10,117 --> 01:00:13,700
but only these fire-people bother us.

978
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:24,192
Man on speaker:
We have been sighted by the enemy!

979
01:00:24,192 --> 01:00:26,442
They are forming a concentrated attack...

980
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:29,992
Pattern 6, vernier index 1-2.

981
01:00:29,992 --> 01:00:31,242
Six?

982
01:00:31,242 --> 01:00:33,709
They never attacked on that one before.

983
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:40,117
What are we going to do?

984
01:00:40,117 --> 01:00:42,534
We must try to break up the attack.

985
01:01:57,499 --> 01:01:58,625
It's fantastic.

986
01:01:58,825 --> 01:02:01,075
We can do one of two things:

987
01:02:01,075 --> 01:02:02,409
Outrun them or fight them.

988
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:04,650
Well, breaking up a formation is one thing,

989
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,399
but how can you fight them?

990
01:02:06,399 --> 01:02:07,699
Do you have a chance?

991
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:10,159
We have to settle that once and for all.

992
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:13,667
Living in constant
danger isn't worthy of us.

993
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:14,701
Don't forget...

994
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:17,242
we still have the gravity control.

995
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:18,699
The gravest danger to us

996
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:20,992
is the high-intensity heat bomb.

997
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:22,009
Right.

998
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,700
They have enough concentrated heat

999
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,084
to blow up our planet instantly.

1000
01:02:26,084 --> 01:02:27,259
What would you do?

1001
01:02:28,759 --> 01:02:29,967
I would fight.

1002
01:02:30,567 --> 01:02:31,626
And you?

1003
01:02:33,726 --> 01:02:34,599
Fight.

1004
01:02:34,599 --> 01:02:35,800
Right.

1005
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,799
That's exactly my decision.

1006
01:02:38,299 --> 01:02:39,617
Prepare for battle.

1007
01:02:40,117 --> 01:02:42,842
Sharp acceleration for attack position.

1008
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:56,999
Maneuver so that we face
the enemy when they attack.

1009
01:03:05,959 --> 01:03:07,042
Herron,

1010
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:10,409
alert our units to be
ready for frontal attack.

1011
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:11,799
All units!

1012
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:13,900
Prepare for frontal attack!

1013
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:31,283
Activate the gravity curtain.

1014
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:55,775
Oh, it was a magnificent victory!

1015
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:58,825
But I'm deeply plagued with regret

1016
01:04:58,825 --> 01:05:01,492
when I'm forced to destroy.

1017
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:03,159
If it wasn't them,
it would have been you.

1018
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:04,767
Perhaps you are right.

1019
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,542
You are wise, Chapman.

1020
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:09,825
One day, you and Herron
will lead our people.

1021
01:05:09,825 --> 01:05:11,617
Well, I'm honored and grateful, but...

1022
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,634
I will teach him all he needs to know.

1023
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:32,409
Where's Zetha?

1024
01:05:32,409 --> 01:05:34,034
She went to sleep early.

1025
01:05:34,034 --> 01:05:35,409
Sleep.

1026
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:36,799
I'm very tired.

1027
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:40,083
Perhaps the battle was
too much of a strain on me.

1028
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,201
Good night.

1029
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:42,867
- Sleep well, Sessom.
- Good night.

1030
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:52,959
Ahh!

1031
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:54,575
What was that?

1032
01:08:54,575 --> 01:08:55,998
It was over there.

1033
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:06,484
Help.

1034
01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:07,299
It's Sessom.

1035
01:09:07,499 --> 01:09:08,575
Oh, father!

1036
01:09:09,575 --> 01:09:10,667
Oh, father.

1037
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:12,099
What happened to him?

1038
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:13,559
I think it was the Solarite.

1039
01:09:13,559 --> 01:09:14,699
Are you all right?

1040
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:16,634
What happened?

1041
01:09:17,034 --> 01:09:18,367
I don't know.

1042
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:19,700
Was it the Solarite?

1043
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,200
Did you see him?

1044
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,558
It was terrible.

1045
01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:53,842
Herron: I'm going to the control room.

1046
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:55,150
Chapman: No, you stay with Liara.

1047
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,434
Chapman!

1048
01:09:57,934 --> 01:09:58,999
Yes?

1049
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:02,026
Go through that corridor.

1050
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:02,792
It's shorter.

1051
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:04,517
- Thanks.
- But be careful.

1052
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,099
I'll be all right.

1053
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:07,350
Oh, Herron.

1054
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,492
Zetha! Are you all right?

1055
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:38,226
Hey! Watch the plates!

1056
01:11:30,084 --> 01:11:31,209
How is Sessom?

1057
01:11:31,409 --> 01:11:33,359
He'll be all right. Liara is with him.

1058
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:34,109
I'm glad.

1059
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:36,492
Do you still wish to return to your world?

1060
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:36,909
Yes, but...

1061
01:11:36,909 --> 01:11:38,367
Well, then tonight's the best time.

1062
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:39,501
You see, the chaos of battle

1063
01:11:39,501 --> 01:11:40,483
has brought us closer to your Moon

1064
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:41,642
than we've ever been.

1065
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:43,892
It will be a simple task to maneuver Rayton

1066
01:11:43,892 --> 01:11:45,100
slowly and steadily even closer,

1067
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,317
and the risk will not be so great,

1068
01:11:46,317 --> 01:11:48,199
because the travel time will be short.

1069
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:50,267
And we'll be well within
the range of Moon's radar.

1070
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:52,359
Yes, but we cannot go unnoticed.

1071
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:55,283
Now, as soon as we're
within range of your Moon,

1072
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:57,667
my men will carry your
suit out into the open.

1073
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:59,699
Now, if your people come to investigate,

1074
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:00,984
we'll pull them into our gravity

1075
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:01,934
and direct their landing.

1076
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:04,242
Meanwhile, you will enter your suit,

1077
01:12:04,242 --> 01:12:06,909
seal it up so that you're not
exposed to our atmosphere,

1078
01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:08,992
and...well, the rest you know.

1079
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:10,292
Where shall I meet you?

1080
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,700
In the control chamber.

1081
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,925
Someone will come for you.

1082
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:24,159
Zetha.

1083
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,551
It's you.

1084
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:27,650
Yes, Frank Chapman.

1085
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,076
But you can talk!

1086
01:12:29,776 --> 01:12:31,109
From my fright.

1087
01:12:31,109 --> 01:12:32,642
When I thought you were going to be killed,

1088
01:12:32,642 --> 01:12:34,099
something happened.

1089
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,018
And after I screamed,

1090
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,517
I found I was able to speak.

1091
01:12:38,517 --> 01:12:39,883
Zetha.

1092
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:42,399
I have many things to say to you,

1093
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,359
Frank Chapman.

1094
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,234
It's so wonderful, you being able to talk,

1095
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:48,559
and I have so many things to say to you.

1096
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:51,950
Oh, everything has been terrible.

1097
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:56,734
You're so lovely.

1098
01:12:56,734 --> 01:12:58,999
You have such an adorable little face.

1099
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:13,899
Isn't it strange?

1100
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:16,326
Here in this place

1101
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:20,334
I've found perhaps what I've
been looking for all my life...

1102
01:13:20,659 --> 01:13:22,534
and I must leave.

1103
01:13:22,534 --> 01:13:26,675
Oh, everything within me wants to stay.

1104
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:30,699
It's my solemn duty to leave.

1105
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:33,042
You understand that, don't you?

1106
01:13:36,142 --> 01:13:38,375
Frank Chapman, I've been in love with you

1107
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:40,959
since the first time I saw you,

1108
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:44,067
and I've never been able to
speak a word of it until now.

1109
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:49,734
But as I know my love for you is so strong,

1110
01:13:50,534 --> 01:13:54,699
so I also know that you will leave.

1111
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:56,283
I must leave.

1112
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:24,084
Good. You're on time.

1113
01:14:25,284 --> 01:14:26,334
Here we go.

1114
01:14:29,034 --> 01:14:31,701
Another hour, and we shall be
close enough for you to be found.

1115
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:51,042
Woman on radio:
Lunar Base 1 to Rocketship 3-8-0. Over.

1116
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:54,900
This is Rocketship 3-8-0 to
Lunar Base 1. Over.

1117
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,759
Radar has just picked
up a giant asteroid...

1118
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:58,509
identity unknown.

1119
01:14:58,509 --> 01:15:01,783
Cannot find any record
of it in the space charts.

1120
01:15:01,783 --> 01:15:03,034
The phantom planet.

1121
01:15:03,134 --> 01:15:05,699
Give us exact position of asteroid.

1122
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,799
Nine degrees, in northern cluster field,

1123
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:10,201
and I have an order from Colonel Lansfield.

1124
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:12,626
You are to land on this asteroid

1125
01:15:12,626 --> 01:15:14,592
and send White to investigate.

1126
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:17,459
I...

1127
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:21,575
I hope you will find happiness
back with your people.

1128
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:23,700
You would be my happiness,

1129
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,817
here or there.

1130
01:15:28,117 --> 01:15:29,775
Frank Chapman, please.

1131
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:32,418
You must take this stone.

1132
01:15:33,618 --> 01:15:35,383
It will be a good luck charm.

1133
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:38,334
Hold on to it.

1134
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,718
It will help you to go
back safely to your people.

1135
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:42,999
Keep it...

1136
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:46,209
and remember my...

1137
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:48,867
my love.

1138
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:49,950
Yes, Zetha.

1139
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:52,318
I'll keep it forever.

1140
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,483
We just confirmed it.

1141
01:15:57,783 --> 01:16:00,559
A rocket similar to yours
is heading in our direction.

1142
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,118
I hope it won't crash.

1143
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:03,392
Don't worry.

1144
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:07,117
I have the best men on gravitation control,

1145
01:16:07,117 --> 01:16:08,034
and I have another man

1146
01:16:08,034 --> 01:16:09,992
who's coming to help me
turn on the oxygen tanks

1147
01:16:09,992 --> 01:16:12,117
as soon as you're in your suit.

1148
01:16:12,117 --> 01:16:13,992
Thank you, Herron.

1149
01:16:13,992 --> 01:16:16,167
You know, we've become friends here.

1150
01:16:17,867 --> 01:16:19,067
Good friends.

1151
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:23,699
We would have become friends anywhere,

1152
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:26,126
your planet or my Earth.

1153
01:16:27,326 --> 01:16:29,767
I wish you and Liara much happiness.

1154
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:21,499
I find you guilty as charged.

1155
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:22,759
Kill him!

1156
01:17:23,659 --> 01:17:25,467
You'll never see your world again.

1157
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,767
Frank Chapman, I've been in love with you

1158
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:42,999
ever since the first time I saw you.

1159
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:48,334
Chapman.

1160
01:17:48,534 --> 01:17:49,592
Chapman!

1161
01:17:50,992 --> 01:17:52,700
White to Beecher.

1162
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,759
Come in, White.

1163
01:17:53,759 --> 01:17:54,999
I found Chapman.

1164
01:17:54,999 --> 01:17:55,999
He's alive.

1165
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:58,534
But there's no trace of Makonnen.

1166
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:01,309
Where's Makonnen?

1167
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:02,967
He's dead.

1168
01:18:03,867 --> 01:18:04,917
He's gone.

1169
01:18:13,926 --> 01:18:15,542
Where are we?

1170
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:18,283
Where are they?

1171
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:20,976
Where are the others?

1172
01:18:22,376 --> 01:18:23,384
Where's who?

1173
01:18:23,884 --> 01:18:24,967
Zetha.

1174
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,642
What are you talking about?

1175
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:28,259
Sessom.

1176
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:30,399
Herron.

1177
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:34,559
Come on. Let's get back to the ship.

1178
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:43,518
White to Beecher.

1179
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:45,783
I'm bringing him in.

1180
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:47,659
He seems to be all right.

1181
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:49,242
He says Makonnen is dead.

1182
01:18:49,242 --> 01:18:50,925
He keeps talking about other people.

1183
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:52,992
I think he's in a state of shock.

1184
01:18:52,992 --> 01:18:54,159
Do you need assistance?

1185
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,275
No, captain. I can handle him alone.

1186
01:18:58,075 --> 01:18:59,959
You know, Frank, you're a lucky guy.

1187
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:03,159
This is a wandering planet.

1188
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:04,699
It could have carried you anywhere.

1189
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:08,475
I'm sure glad we found you.

1190
01:19:09,475 --> 01:19:10,650
Zetha.

1191
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,001
Where is she?

1192
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:17,099
What you need is a rest.

1193
01:19:41,992 --> 01:19:43,725
Prepare for immediate take-off.

1194
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,399
How do you feel, Chapman?

1195
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:52,767
I don't know.

1196
01:19:54,867 --> 01:19:56,299
I don't understand.

1197
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,034
Oh, it's unbelievable.

1198
01:20:00,534 --> 01:20:03,917
Beecher: We'll get you back to
Moon Base for a thorough examination.

1199
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,550
Do you think you're hurt?

1200
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:08,275
I don't think so.

1201
01:20:09,075 --> 01:20:11,626
You must have been
knocked out for quite a while.

1202
01:20:14,326 --> 01:20:15,799
I must have been dreaming.

1203
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:18,699
It's quite possible you were delirious

1204
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:21,199
from the shock of the
crash-landing of your ship.

1205
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,159
Ray is gone.

1206
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:27,599
But I just left Zetha and Herron.

1207
01:20:40,992 --> 01:20:43,484
She had such an adorable little face.

1208
01:20:46,284 --> 01:20:47,700
All rockets ready for firing.

1209
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,067
Stand by for countdown.

1210
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:52,659
The gravity of this
planetoid is very strong.

1211
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:54,767
We'll need every bit
of thrust for our takeoff.

1212
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,809
Don't worry.

1213
01:20:56,409 --> 01:20:58,034
I know we're gonna make it.

1214
01:20:58,334 --> 01:20:59,417
Start your countdown.

1215
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:00,818
10...

1216
01:21:00,818 --> 01:21:01,967
9...

1217
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:02,867
8...

1218
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:04,099
7...

1219
01:21:04,099 --> 01:21:04,917
6...

1220
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:05,818
5...

1221
01:21:05,818 --> 01:21:06,967
4...

1222
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,467
3...

1223
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:09,799
2...

1224
01:21:09,799 --> 01:21:10,487
1...

1225
01:21:10,511 --> 01:21:11,899
zero.

1226
01:21:20,199 --> 01:21:21,592
Cut off power.

1227
01:21:23,092 --> 01:21:24,101
Power off.

1228
01:21:26,201 --> 01:21:27,499
Rear screen.

1229
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:29,742
Rear screen.

1230
01:21:36,242 --> 01:21:38,192
I know now they'll never believe me.

1231
01:21:39,992 --> 01:21:42,500
Even with this, they'll never believe me.

1232
01:21:55,117 --> 01:21:58,699
Narrator:
What, then, will the future reveal

1233
01:21:58,699 --> 01:22:02,700
if this story is only the beginning?

1234
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,075
Is only the beginning...

1235
01:22:05,075 --> 01:22:07,075
Only the beginning...
