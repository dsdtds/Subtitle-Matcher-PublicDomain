Hello, Thelma.
This is Miller.

3
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,626
No, I don't want the desk.
I want to talk to Phelps.

4
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,632
Yeah?

5
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:40,677
Alright. Put him on.

6
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,929
Hello, Miller.
Watch the beep this time.

7
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,597
Oh, why shouldn't I squawk?

8
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,621
I stay out all night on revenue
boats chasing rumrunners

9
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:48,101
and there's no story.

10
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,644
Besides, haven't you heard?

11
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,063
They don't bring it in anymore.
They ship it out.

12
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,482
Being a newspaper man,
you wouldn't know that.

13
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,734
And my new cap ruined by the fog.

14
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:58,361
Not to mention the seagulls.

15
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:01,030
Well, cry on somebody
else's shoulder. I'm busy.

16
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:03,574
If I do any crying, it'll be on my pillow.

17
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,910
Goodbye with a raspberry.

18
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:30,935
Hey.

19
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,146
No, no.

20
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:36,899
Not tonight, Josephine.

21
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:41,863
Hey.

22
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,490
Well, who are you?

23
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:45,742
Oh, nobody much.

24
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,911
Just the guy that owns the bed and the gin.

25
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:51,289
Very bad.
All three of them.

26
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:53,791
What do you mean, three?

27
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,794
Book you're writing.
Oh.

28
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:01,883
Who are you, anyway?

29
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,969
There's a letter over there,
tell you all about it.

30
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,522
Oh, so you're a newspaper man, huh?

31
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:20,568
Friend of Pete Barrett's,
old classmate of mine.

32
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,488
Hey, how is he?
As useless as ever?

33
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,907
How's he doing in Chicago?

34
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,950
Fine.

35
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:31,079
Great newspaper town, isn't it?

36
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:32,955
What are you doing in this dump?

37
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,416
Looking for work.

38
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,043
Any good jobs in your shop?

39
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:39,921
No, I got the only good one,
and that's terrible.

40
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:42,548
Take my advice and go back to Chicago.

41
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:43,758
I wish I could.

42
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,468
Looks pretty good to me right here.

43
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,720
Yeah?
I thought so once.

44
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:50,515
Pete says you cover the waterfront.

45
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,141
Sounds like a good assignment.

46
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,726
Yeah.

47
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,208
You cover everything from Black Plague

48
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:59,107
to herring smells and don't get anywhere.

49
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,694
I've been doing it so long,
the seagulls know me.

50
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,197
Well,

51
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,033
do you mind if I get the bed?

52
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:12,078
I'll tell you what.
I'll cover the waterfront,

53
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,998
you go back to Chicago,
and I'll keep the bed.

54
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:19,001
Come on, Gibb William.

55
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:22,463
What a fine host you turned out to be.

56
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:24,882
Now look what you've done.

57
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:27,176
I'm wide awake.

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,928
Alright.

59
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:30,930
I might as well see what
this place looks like

60
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,557
in the daytime.

61
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:39,897
Ooh, a little harbor.

62
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:45,403
It's grown.

63
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:51,951
Is that a beautiful harbor?

64
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:54,245
Oh, you think so?

65
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:57,165
There's one guy out there
with a rowboat full of junk,

66
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,292
seems to be dragging the harbor.

67
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,878
The only one around here that's
got the depression licked,

68
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,172
and his own boss, too.

69
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:05,673
He drags her bottom of the harbor

70
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:08,134
and lives off of stuff
other people throw away.

71
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:10,636
Anybody left that's got
anything to throw away?

72
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,097
Oh, shut up, will you?

73
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,242
Who's the floozy?

74
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,747
Oh, just the girl I want to marry.

75
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,415
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,250
In love, eh?

77
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,460
Local talent?

78
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,462
I should say not.

79
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,880
Vermont.

80
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,423
That why you want to get out?

81
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:49,091
One reason.

82
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,596
Oh, it never fails.

83
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:00,311
Oh, so you're going to play Indian.

84
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,484
Hello?

85
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:10,404
Listen, Weeping Willy,
I've got a hot lead for you.

86
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,114
A woman just phoned in that a girl

87
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:15,284
is swimming in Santa Ana Cove
without any clothes on.

88
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:17,954
Then the fashion editor out to cover it.

89
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:20,248
I've been out all night
chasing down your crazy leads.

90
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:22,291
Lay off me, will you?
I need some sleep.

91
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,542
I don't pay you to sleep.

92
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:25,419
Go out and get that story.

93
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:27,255
From the way the old lady described it,

94
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:28,464
it's news.

95
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:31,342
I'll switch the call.

96
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,094
Switch this call.

97
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,303
Here you are.

98
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,680
No clothes at all,

99
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,223
bathing right in front of my house.

100
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:40,476
Then how do you know
she hasn't got any clothes on?

101
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:43,229
I have a telescope.

102
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,690
Then what are you kicking about?

103
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:16,595
I suppose you look through keyholes, too.

104
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,098
If there any around your house,
I do from now on.

105
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:20,558
Are you gonna give me my suit,

106
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,185
or do I have to go over there and get it?

107
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,687
Is this your suit?
No.

108
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,606
No, it's my grandmother's,
but she lets me use it.

109
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,859
Well, then why don't you?

110
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:33,029
Because I like to swim
without one, don't you?

111
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:34,447
Now, don't change the subject.

112
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,324
This is business with me.

113
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,326
You don't think I'm here because I like it?

114
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:41,203
Oh, pardon me.

115
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,352
I just had no idea you were
sitting there looking at me

116
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:45,416
because I didn't have any clothes on.

117
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,877
Oh, haven't you?
I hadn't noticed.

118
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,546
Oh, you're very funny.
Come on now.

119
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,340
Give me that.

120
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:54,633
You know, I'm supposed to
get a story about you.

121
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,886
There have been complaints.

122
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,305
What, about my swimming here?

123
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:01,891
Yeah, the neighbors.
They're kicking.

124
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,060
What neighbors?

125
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:06,562
Up there.

126
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,357
A telescope made them very close neighbors.

127
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,567
Oh, I bet it was a woman.

128
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,154
Of course. No gentleman
would say a word.

129
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:17,782
And you're a gentleman, of course.

130
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,450
I haven't said a word.

131
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,118
Come on, give me that suit.

132
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:23,621
By the way, what's your name?

133
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:27,500
Julie Kirk.

134
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,795
Kirk?
Eli Kirk's daughter?

135
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:31,962
Yeah.

136
00:08:32,046 --> 00:08:34,256
Say, I know your old man.

137
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,801
Well, isn't that just dandy?

138
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,720
Come on now,
will you please give me my suit?

139
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,348
Sure.

140
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:44,392
Take it out and have it drove for me.

141
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:47,436
Well, I'll be seeing you.

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,356
You've seen too much of me already.

143
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,633
Oh, cheer up.

144
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:20,177
You can possibly feel as bad as I do.

145
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,680
That cluck, Phelps, chasing me
all over the bay for squibs

146
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,182
and fellows that could be
handled by the rewrite desk.

147
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:27,727
All editors are fatheads.

148
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,312
Except when you're looking for a job.

149
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,440
Give me a Phelps.

150
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:38,342
- Yeah? - Well, the girl's name is Kirk. Julie Kirk.
- Yeah? - Well, the girl's name is Kirk. Julie Kirk.

151
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:39,947
She swims raw because she likes it.

152
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,241
And you know what you can
do with the story.

153
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,744
Okay, we play it upbeat.
Make it a nudist colony.

154
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:48,664
"Police refuse to interfere,
decent citizens up in arms,

155
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:49,980
- and so forth.
- Go ahead!

156
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,834
Plaster it all over the front page,

157
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,357
but if you had any real editorial sense,

158
00:09:53,377 --> 00:09:54,879
you'd let me go after her father.

159
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,172
There's a real story there.

160
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,799
There you go.
Eli Kirk again.

161
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,301
I tell you it's cold.

162
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,552
The boys in the Coast Guard

163
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:03,012
have been watching him for a month

164
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,513
and I haven't got a thing on him.

165
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:06,724
Now listen, you mental midget,

166
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,226
there's Chinese smuggling
going on in this port,

167
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,021
and Kirk's at the bottom of it.

168
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:13,419
Also, if you don't want the story,

169
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:15,900
I'll give it to McGurk at The Herald.

170
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,777
Alright, mental giant.
Go after Kirk.

171
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:20,219
But if you miss...!

172
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:20,219
But if you miss...!

173
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,614
Thanks, big hog.

174
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:25,534
I take back all the mean
things I thought about you.

175
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,411
Now there's a great guy.

176
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:29,580
At last, we agree.

177
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,708
When two guys agree,
one of them is unnecessary.

178
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,628
All city editors are unnecessary.

179
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,264
There you are.

180
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,079
Thank you,
Capitan. Thank you.

181
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:50,976
When you can't make a living off tuna,

182
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,146
you might just as well fish for yellowtail.

183
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,442
You know, they ain't bad folks.

184
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,319
Somebody's got to do the washing.

185
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:01,820
Them, for instance...

186
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:05,199
He gave me the $700 to get him across,

187
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,243
and look what he wrapped it up in.

188
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:10,079
Pretty, eh?
Hmm.

189
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:14,416
Capita, that's gonna look very funny on you

190
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,960
On me?

191
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,003
Well, that's for Julie, my daughter.

192
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,755
Oh.

193
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:37,189
Every time I look at
this fish, I have to laugh.

194
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:40,109
Oh, Capitan, you very smart man.

195
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,695
You've got to be smart these days.

196
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,240
Them Coast Guards are onto everything.

197
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,700
Almost.

198
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,329
What's that?

199
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:56,625
Looks like Coast Guard now!

200
00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:59,086
Maybe.
Come on, let's get busy.

201
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,171
Frank, bring that piece of anchor chain!

202
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,929
Quiet, quiet.

203
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,307
Wrap that around his legs.

204
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,852
Capitan, for why the chain?

205
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,061
So's he'll sink.

206
00:12:16,145 --> 00:12:17,396
With that kind of stop,

207
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,128
we don't want no evidence floating around.

208
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:20,816
Oh, tough on him, alright.

209
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,820
No, he knows he's got to take
a chance to get into the States.

210
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:31,118
Looks like they're gonna board us, alright.

211
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,870
Get him over the rail, but don't drop him

212
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,247
until I give the words, see?

213
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,639
Alright. Let go.

214
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:54,934
Now, Capitan?
Yes, now.

215
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,561
Let go.

216
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,337
What do you got aboard?

217
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,463
Fish.

218
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:26,298
Mind if we take a look?

219
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:30,386
No.

220
00:13:30,469 --> 00:13:31,929
Hello, Kirk.

221
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,724
Looking for another
story to write about me?

222
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:38,435
Yeah. I'm going
to make you famous.

223
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,689
Put your picture on every
front page in the country.

224
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:43,899
If nothing happens to you.

225
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,026
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

226
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,528
You sure of that?

227
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:50,739
So sure I've got the end
of the story written already...

228
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:52,616
your obituary.

229
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,577
It says you were a pretty smart guy, Kirk,

230
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,455
but you took Chinese money.

231
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,672
Bull's eye.
Mm-hmm.

232
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:10,217
Come on, Miller.
There's nothing aboard.

233
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,636
I'll be seeing you again, Kirk.

234
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:35,534
Julie?

235
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:41,915
Hello, Eli!
Hello, kid.

236
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,524
- How are you, Julie? - Fine.
- How are you, Julie? - Fine.

237
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,087
Did you have any luck?

238
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,423
All the luck in the world.

239
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:54,303
All the luck in the world
having you to come to again.

240
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:55,888
Oh, now, don't get sentimental.

241
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:57,473
Did you have a good cruise?

242
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:59,808
What?
Oh... Oh, sure. Yes.

243
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,643
What's the matter, fish not biting?

244
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:04,813
Sure, they was biting.

245
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:06,899
I brought you something.

246
00:15:06,982 --> 00:15:09,985
Oh, gee, thanks.
What is it?

247
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:11,361
Go on, open it up.

248
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,865
I can't.

249
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,865
I can't.

250
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:14,323
Here, here, wait a minute.

251
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:20,162
There.

252
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,955
Oh, say.

253
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,792
Well, that's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

254
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,794
Wouldn't take much.

255
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,670
Oh!

256
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:46,146
Hello, Chris!
Any news?

257
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,441
You know.

258
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,985
Catching anything today?

259
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,613
Oh, I picked up a pretty fair rubber boot

260
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,406
over by the lighthouse.

261
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,077
Worth about a dime.

262
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,077
Worth about a dime.

263
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,701
Who'd buy one rubber boot?

264
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,246
One-legged guy.

265
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:05,415
Got a sack of whiskey last week.

266
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,835
Any of it left?
Nah.

267
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:09,545
How much did you get for it?

268
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:12,047
A good drunk.

269
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,091
Got something.

270
00:16:17,553 --> 00:16:19,555
Easy.

271
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:23,517
Oh.

272
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,894
Feels kind of funny.

273
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,691
Coming up crooked.

274
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:47,416
The sharks around here
are getting highfalutin'.

275
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:50,168
Yellow bait ain't good enough.

276
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,212
How long you think he's been in the water?

277
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:54,715
Oh, not more than a day.

278
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,801
The crabs ain't got at him yet.

279
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:59,199
You know, everything that
goes on around here

280
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,368
- below the surface.
- Yeah.

281
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,097
How have you got it figured?

282
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,390
Well, son...

283
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,267
this here chink didn't put
them there chains

284
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,811
around his feet his self.

285
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,771
And with them chains around his feet,

286
00:17:09,855 --> 00:17:12,482
he didn't do much jumping.

287
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,444
Looks like he was dunked.

288
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:18,947
Seeing as he's used to it,
I'll dunk him again.

289
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,198
Oh, no, you won't.

290
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:21,597
This poor chink tried pretty hard

291
00:17:21,617 --> 00:17:22,951
to get in the United States.

292
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:25,078
I'm taking him in.

293
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:28,373
Don't go flicking your tail at trouble.

294
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,083
Whoever tied them chains around him

295
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,460
ain't gonna thank you none.

296
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:32,586
Never mind.

297
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:35,672
Sell me this chink.
He's news.

298
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,674
Arlene, tell Phelps I want to see him.

299
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:39,468
And get a photographer.

300
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:42,701
- What do you got in the bundle, Miller? - What is it?
- What do you got in the bundle, Miller? - What is it?

301
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,140
Thanks, Rico.

302
00:17:45,223 --> 00:17:46,516
Thanks, Joe.

303
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
What have you got there?
What's the idea?

304
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:49,478
I got evidence.

305
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,959
What do you mean by bringing that in here?

306
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:53,065
Get it out.
What is it?

307
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,442
Something the tide dragged in.

308
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,236
Come on, get half smart, will you?

309
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,695
Do you get it?

310
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,574
Kirk drowned the evidence
and the tide dragged it in.

311
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:04,743
That's simple enough for you to understand.

312
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:06,328
Do you want me to print that?

313
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:08,163
What do you think I want you to do with it,

314
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:09,915
have it stuffed?

315
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:12,084
If we print one line about Kirk's boat

316
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,086
on your story of finding this body,

317
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,088
we'll have a libel suit on our hands.

318
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,589
Probably cost us fifty grand.

319
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:19,424
Oh, for the love of my...

320
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,842
See this chain?

321
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:24,179
Come here, will you?

322
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:27,557
The same chain came off
of Kirk's boat. I checked it.

323
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:30,686
I wouldn't care if the chink
had Kirk's drawers on.

324
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:33,188
The police won't make
an arrest on that evidence.

325
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,274
I want an arrest.

326
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:35,315
But it's true.

327
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,234
Have I ever been wrong? Yes!

328
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,278
The time you got that crazy
countess off the Laconia,

329
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:41,863
said she was expecting a baby.

330
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,573
Ha! She wasn't
even married.

331
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:44,866
Oh, well, that was her story.

332
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,244
She sued and collected.

333
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,704
And when you pulled that yarn

334
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:50,872
about the porpoise that
swallowed a pint of rye

335
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,541
and danced a jig on the dock.

336
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:55,335
The greatest fish story
since Jonah and the Whale.

337
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:58,255
Can I help having imagination?

338
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,424
Come in here.

339
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:06,763
The trouble with you is you've
got too much imagination.

340
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,391
Now you want to accuse Eli Kirk of murder.

341
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:12,394
On a thing like this,
you can only be wrong once.

342
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:13,770
It's a great story.

343
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:15,897
You're right about that,
and I want to print it,

344
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,733
but I've got to have the facts first.

345
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:19,860
Alright, it's a fact I found this one

346
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,383
and it's a fact somebody murdered him,

347
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:23,155
and I'm gonna prove that Kirk did it.

348
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:25,198
How?

349
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:28,410
Kirk's got a daughter.
She must know something.

350
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,078
Is it worth expenses to you?

351
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:31,288
What for?

352
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,206
Gin and roses.

353
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,125
Gonna make love to her?

354
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,086
If I have to.

355
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,713
Okay.

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,923
Say, Julie, you don't remember much

357
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,550
about Singapore, do you?

358
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:46,511
No.
Oh, grand.

359
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:49,097
Well, I loved that funny,
little island, remember?

360
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:53,935
What? Yeah. Oh, it was fun.

361
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,064
How would you like to go back there?

362
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,607
You figuring to move?

363
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,816
Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,903
No, I've been kind of restless lately

365
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:05,614
because I've got the tide in my blood.

366
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:09,826
Besides, I don't like
the price of fish around here.

367
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,539
Eli, you're not in any trouble, are you?

368
00:20:14,623 --> 00:20:17,334
Why... Why, no.

369
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,127
Not exactly.

370
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:22,089
I thought you were going
to stick to fishing.

371
00:20:23,882 --> 00:20:26,927
You're not gonna change your mind, are you?

372
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,805
There ain't no money in it anymore.

373
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:35,435
We better go away
some place else and start over.

374
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,646
Well, when do you want to leave?

375
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:42,818
Oh, another week or two,
I'll have enough money.

376
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:44,069
Alright.

377
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:49,533
Any time you say, anywhere you want.

378
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:52,160
Only take me along.

379
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,446
Just when I start to feel good,

380
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,991
you pour ice water on the parade.

381
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,368
I can't spend all Phelps' dough
buying you liquor.

382
00:21:33,451 --> 00:21:35,036
I got to get this story.

383
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,997
Now here's where we're going.

384
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,458
Wait a minute.

385
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,127
Boarding house?

386
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,421
Well, I'm gonna have to drag you

387
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,214
from one speakeasy to another.

388
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:48,216
That's alright with me, but why?

389
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,614
- You hear that? - Sure.
- You hear that? - Sure.

390
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:50,635
It's Kirk.

391
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,262
When he plays the piano, he's drunk,

392
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:53,763
and when he's drunk, he talks.

393
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,223
Come on.

394
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,697
Ain't that beautiful?

395
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,408
Oh, I eat little girls like you!

396
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:18,288
Why, Grandma, what big teeth you have.

397
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,415
Come on, Mac.
They're not good to eat.

398
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:23,084
What's the matter with you?
Aren't you interested in girls?

399
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:25,170
No.
Oh, I forgot.

400
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:28,715
You're in love.
Girl in Vermont.

401
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,113
What's your matter with her, anyway?

402
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:31,593
Nothing's the matter with her.

403
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:33,845
She's waited for you for five years?

404
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,680
She must be muscle-bound.

405
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:38,433
Oh, shut up and sit down, will you?

406
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,185
What's your name, baby?

407
00:22:40,268 --> 00:22:44,064
Lucy, handsome.

408
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,274
Lucy.

409
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:49,319
I never heard anything so beautiful

410
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,196
in my life...

411
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,578
What's the idea?

412
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:00,413
I eat little girls like you.

413
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:03,333
I am the world's greatest lover.

414
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,501
Sit down,

415
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,962
while you're all in one piece.

416
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:08,463
Come on, honey.

417
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:10,257
Why, I'll kick that guy to death.

418
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,008
Now, listen, Mac.

419
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,135
Have all the fun you want,
but don't get in a fight.

420
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:16,054
I'm here on business.

421
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,639
You mean you're working? Yeah.

422
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:18,890
In here,

423
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:22,060
surrounded by all this wealth and beauty?

424
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:23,561
Yeah, and if I get what I'm after,

425
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,231
it'll be a wire story for
every front page in America.

426
00:23:26,314 --> 00:23:28,338
I'll be able to go East
and get a job at a decent rag.

427
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:31,027
Go East, young man.
Go East.

428
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,238
Get a Pulitzer prize.

429
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:37,117
I'll cover the waterfront.

430
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:01,016
Hello, honey. Oh, hello, Mama Morgan.

431
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:05,312
Eli here? Why, um... why no, he ain't.

432
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:07,689
What's his coat doing by the piano?

433
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:11,192
It's alright.
I'll wait.

434
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:12,652
Uh-oh.

435
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:15,822
I'm think I'm gonna get that
story sooner than I expected.

436
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:18,700
I knew a guy went after a story like that.

437
00:24:18,783 --> 00:24:22,871
He's pushing up daisies now.

438
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:26,875
Work on this until I get back.

439
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:32,839
Well, here's to him.

440
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:40,555
Hello, swimmer.

441
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:44,893
Oh, Nosy Joe, the Peeping Tom.

442
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,354
How are you?
Sick abed.

443
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:49,481
Let's have a drink and
I'll tell you all about it.

444
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:50,940
No.

445
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:52,567
Dancing's my vice.

446
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,402
Your only vice?

447
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:56,154
No.

448
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:59,074
Okay, let's go.

449
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,475
You wouldn't go for a kiss, would you?

450
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,168
No, not very far.
Why?

451
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,503
Well, because...

452
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:14,255
Oh, because I'm the most
beautiful girl you ever saw.

453
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:15,799
That's right.
What's a nice...

454
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,258
Oh, I know that one, too.

455
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:19,886
"What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?"

456
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,179
Well, that's all settled.

457
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:22,931
Now I'll give you my telephone number

458
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,334
and then I guess you can kiss me.

459
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:26,935
Thanks. No, I'm very busy right now.

460
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:28,895
Well, are you being kissed on Friday?

461
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:30,230
What day is that?
Today.

462
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:31,879
Yeah?

463
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:31,879
Yeah?

464
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,483
Ohhh!

465
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,777
Lucy's a great gal.

466
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,279
All for Lucy!
Champagne!

467
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:40,031
Come on, dear.
Let's sit down.

468
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:41,783
Little girl, will you marry me?

469
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:43,368
Later, honey.

470
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:45,036
Eli!

471
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,800
I thought I told you not to start a fight.

472
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,915
Guess that'll teach him
not to fool with me.

473
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,250
One-Punch McCoy, that's me.

474
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,668
Oh, shut up and sit down.

475
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,086
Is he alright?

476
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:55,880
It's one of his dizzy spells.
Gift me a lift, will you?

477
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:57,298
I was waiting to take him home.

478
00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:58,550
Come on, Eli.

479
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:02,470
He owes Babe for it.
$50, $30 more coming.

480
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:04,848
And they make jokes about Scotchmen here.

481
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,683
Hold him.

482
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:14,482
Not a cent.

483
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:17,068
He's been rolled for it.

484
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:24,784
Where's that money?

485
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,286
What money?

486
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:27,954
The money that was in here.

487
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,248
Look who's trying to be funny.

488
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,499
Oh, I know,

489
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:35,170
you never been so insulted in your life.

490
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:36,337
Come on.
Hand it over.

491
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:38,506
Listen, any money I got my sock,

492
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,841
I'm gonna keep.

493
00:26:39,924 --> 00:26:42,927
What you're looking for
is a good slap in the face.

494
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,686
Bravo. Bravo.

495
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:55,899
Thanks, honey.

496
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,275
Get him out of here, will you?

497
00:26:57,358 --> 00:27:00,195
He's halfway home right now.

498
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:03,698
Gee, I'm an heiress.

499
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:05,950
Yeah, over 500 berries.

500
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:10,538
Hey, he must have been catching goldfish.

501
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,252
Oh, here.

502
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,254
Give her this.
She's breaking my heart.

503
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:19,672
All this?

504
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:21,007
Yeah, I guess she earned it.

505
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,800
And take care of the press, too, will you?

506
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:24,700
- Alright.
- You ready?

507
00:27:24,802 --> 00:27:25,845
Come on, we're off.

508
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,018
Hello, cutie.

509
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,937
I eat little girls like you.

510
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,106
Oh, do you?

511
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:42,445
But it would take months
and months and months.

512
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,531
Oh, I'm sorry to cause you
all this trouble.

513
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:46,783
Oh, no trouble at all with you along.

514
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,243
He'll be in terrible shape

515
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:50,328
to go off on another cruise tomorrow.

516
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:51,621
Going out tomorrow, is he?

517
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,748
Yeah. The fish must be running, huh?

518
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:55,041
Yeah, I guess so.

519
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:57,252
You going along?
No.

520
00:27:57,335 --> 00:27:59,587
When he's fishing, he won't
have a woman on board.

521
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:01,005
Says the fish don't bite.

522
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,299
Then you must have a lot of
spare time on your hands.

523
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:04,509
Yeah.

524
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:08,096
You mind if I take up
most of it from now on?

525
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,266
Intentions honorable?

526
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,266
Intentions honorable?

527
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:10,390
No.

528
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:14,018
Oh, that's not very romantic.

529
00:28:14,102 --> 00:28:17,313
Well, this isn't a very romantic situation.

530
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,439
Sure it is.

531
00:28:18,523 --> 00:28:20,692
Marvelous moon, beautiful girl.

532
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:22,193
Taking father home drunk?

533
00:28:22,277 --> 00:28:24,153
Oh, get out, your love you.

534
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:27,031
Say, he and I can get home by ourselves.

535
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,658
If that's the way you feel about it.

536
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,285
I'll be waiting for you. Don't bother.

537
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:32,495
Come on, Eli.
Get up.

538
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:33,935
Come on, now.
You've got to get home.

539
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:36,416
Come on.

540
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:37,584
Oh.

541
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:39,669
I told you we'd be alright!

542
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,754
Come on, Eli.
You can make it.

543
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:45,466
Sure he can... with a little help.

544
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,928
Oh!

545
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:48,344
See? He made it.

546
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:55,435
No. No. No.

547
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:00,481
Oh, wait a minute.

548
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:03,651
Here, come on.
Let go.

549
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:05,695
Leave me alone now.
I'm alright.

550
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,948
No, you're not.
C'mon, bottoms up.

551
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:11,159
I don't like it.
Makes me sick.

552
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,244
That's what you're taking it for. Oh.

553
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:14,996
Get rid of all that poison in you.

554
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,249
If you don't, you'll have
a head like a hot stove.

555
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:23,129
Oh, here's your money.

556
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:24,839
What are you doing with it?

557
00:29:24,922 --> 00:29:27,383
Taking better care of it than you did.

558
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:28,843
Well, listen,

559
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:30,178
I don't want you coming down

560
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:31,929
to that place anymore after me, see?

561
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:33,848
Oh, for Pete's sake, if I didn't go there,

562
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,184
I'd be gonna jail for you tomorrow.

563
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,935
Guess you're right.

564
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,731
I guess I'm lucky to be having
you come anywhere after me.

565
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:44,817
Alright, now don't get
feeling sorry for yourself.

566
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,904
You're alright.
Julie?

567
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,739
God bless you.

568
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:53,451
It sounds kind of funny coming from me.

569
00:29:53,534 --> 00:29:56,954
Hmm!
I must be drunk.

570
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,906
How you coming?

571
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,906
How you coming?

572
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:31,239
I don't know yet,

573
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:33,741
but I'll be alright.

574
00:30:43,543 --> 00:30:46,671
Oh, hello, honey.

575
00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:48,923
So that's all you were waiting for.

576
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:50,842
Come on, now, be your age.

577
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,428
I knew the first time I saw you,
you were nuts about me.

578
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:56,764
Oh, sure. Men can't
resist me, either.

579
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:58,558
Hey, you know something?

580
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:00,184
You look pretty good in swimming,

581
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:02,770
but with that coat on, you're terrific.

582
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:04,021
You like it?

583
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:06,566
If I liked it much more,
I'd start tearing it.

584
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:08,317
New, isn't it?
Mm.

585
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,217
- Chinese? - My father brought it to me this morning.
- Chinese? - My father brought it to me this morning.

586
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,655
Oh, he did?

587
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:16,117
Come on, sit down.
Tell me all about it.

588
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,411
Oh, I get it.
You're a ventriloquist.

589
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:20,037
No, I'm just a dummy.

590
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,126
Don't you love it here?

591
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,419
The waterfront?

592
00:31:26,502 --> 00:31:30,173
No, what's there to love about it?

593
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,633
Summer nights, mostly.

594
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:36,763
When the sun goes down, supper's over,

595
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:40,141
and all the lights come out on the boats.

596
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:41,309
Sure.

597
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:42,915
And the summer days when the sun comes up

598
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,480
and starts to work on the
fish heads lying around.

599
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:47,940
You take a deep breath and it gets you...

600
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:50,693
fish, tar, and bilge oil.

601
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,196
The stink of the waterfront.

602
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,157
You don't write that way about it.

603
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,450
You read my stuff?

604
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,287
Yes.

605
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,287
Yes.

606
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,078
Shake.

607
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:03,331
A lot of cheap baloney
dished up for the farmers

608
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:06,042
who come out here to rot in the sunshine.

609
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,921
Bunk. Fakes.
Drivel.

610
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:11,672
Why do you write it, then?

611
00:32:11,756 --> 00:32:13,591
To eat, darling.

612
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:17,845
Did you ever try writing anything else?

613
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:20,807
I've been trying to finish
a novel for five years.

614
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,975
I wouldn't be surprised.

615
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:24,685
What do you mean?

616
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:27,730
I'll tell you sometime.

617
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:29,065
Oh,

618
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,818
don't let's get serious
on a night like this.

619
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:35,029
Alright, let's get silly.

620
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:37,073
How about a kiss?

621
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:38,366
No.

622
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:42,453
Ah, but we're all alone
with the stars and the sea.

623
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,997
Come on, let's play a love scene.

624
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:46,541
Let's fall in love first.

625
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,549
Miss Kirk? Yeah? Oh, thanks.

626
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,753
Yeah?

627
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:35,590
Take a flyer on "Mrs. Goossens."

628
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:36,988
Oh, spell it yourself, would you?

629
00:33:37,008 --> 00:33:39,552
Became a mother at 8:15 PM
in a water taxi.

630
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,679
Baby will live.
Case a fright.

631
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:45,725
May be responsible, 16-inch guns
during night practice.

632
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:49,270
Yeah? Says she's going
to sue the government.

633
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:50,730
Oh. Oh, yeah.

634
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:52,295
I've got the Empress of Britain
coming in this morning.

635
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:53,441
World cruise.

636
00:33:53,524 --> 00:33:55,234
A Mitzi Vadja, aboard from Bulgaria,

637
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:57,486
wearing pants, going to Hollywood.

638
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,488
Met by three other tough, foreign blonds,

639
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:00,907
also wearing pants,

640
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,867
and they're still kissing each other.

641
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,952
Oh, a lot of notables aboard, all fatheads,

642
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:06,871
had the usual thing to say...
blah blah blah.

643
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:08,354
"What a beautiful hobby you've got.

644
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:09,812
Good times are just around the corner.

645
00:34:09,832 --> 00:34:11,564
Blah blah blah."
Write it yourself, will you?

646
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,545
That Billy you're talking to? Yeah.

647
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:17,673
Give me that.

648
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:22,553
Hey, Miller, that wop florist
is here for $9 more for roses!

649
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:25,806
And the bootlegger
wants %20 for a case of gin.

650
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,600
What are you trying to do?
Marry the girl?

651
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:30,603
If you don't like the way
I make love, you get the story.

652
00:34:30,686 --> 00:34:31,918
But you're not getting the story.

653
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:34,023
You haven't got any dope in three days.

654
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:38,110
Yeah, but she's smart.
Which is more than you are.

655
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,156
Pinhead.

656
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,407
Talking to me?

657
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:45,368
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.

658
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,620
Say, this novel's getting better.

659
00:34:47,703 --> 00:34:49,997
That new love scene is good.

660
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:52,166
You believe those two are falling in love.

661
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:55,461
You never could before.

662
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:57,088
You must be falling in love.

663
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:58,339
Who, me?

664
00:34:58,422 --> 00:34:59,987
With that waterfront girl
you're working on.

665
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:01,258
Her?

666
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:03,803
I'm only playing her to hook a fisherman,

667
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:06,097
and I'll do it,
if Phelps will let me alone.

668
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,848
Can you imagine him kicking about that

669
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:10,206
- case of gin I had sent over your place? - He's kicking?
- case of gin I had sent over your place? - He's kicking?

670
00:35:10,226 --> 00:35:11,582
If there's any kicking
about that lousy gin,

671
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:12,728
I'll do it.

672
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:14,397
I get the headaches.

673
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:28,869
Finest example of the old
prison hulks now in existence.

674
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:32,164
And more poor souls have died in torture

675
00:35:32,248 --> 00:35:36,168
below those blood-stained decks
then I should care to tell you.

676
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:38,796
Visit the torture chamber?

677
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,339
50 cents, please.

678
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:42,717
50 cents? I'm Miller
from The Standard.

679
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,094
I've got to write my usual
column about this old bathtub

680
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,221
for the annual Booze Southern California

681
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:48,514
Blah and Tripe number.

682
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:50,474
Oh yes,
Mr. Miller.

683
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:52,059
Charmed to have you with us.

684
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:53,561
And the little lady, too.

685
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:55,271
Take one of our little booklets.

686
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,961
Take one of your little booklets yourself

687
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:58,295
and stick it in your back pocket.

688
00:35:58,315 --> 00:36:00,943
I know more about this boat than you do.

689
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,125
You wouldn't go for that
kiss now, would you?

690
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,286
Say, I thought you came down here to work.

691
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,934
If you don't think it's work
getting a kiss out of you,

692
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,080
you're nuts.

693
00:36:13,164 --> 00:36:15,916
I've been trying for
three days. Oh, get out.

694
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,128
Come on, now, do your stuff.
What's this?

695
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,172
Oh. Oh, that's
a bird cage.

696
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:22,965
Oh.

697
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:25,968
Well, what's that?

698
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:28,772
- Well, that's a dandruff remover.
- Well, that's a dandruff remover.

699
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:32,516
Ah, but here's the honey.

700
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,397
- C'mere. - Huh? Ow!
- C'mere. - Huh? Ow!

701
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:37,021
They used to hang guys
up here by the wrist.

702
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:38,731
This little contraption is adjustable.

703
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:42,735
They'd raise and lower it
and it always fit you.

704
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:44,153
Of course, they'd raise you high,

705
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,760
so you'd have to stay on your tip-toes.

706
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,448
And then when you were on your toes,

707
00:36:47,531 --> 00:36:49,013
why, they pour hot lead on your feet.

708
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:50,951
C'mere.
I'll show you.

709
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:52,411
They put you there

710
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:54,371
and clamp this around your waist like this

711
00:36:54,455 --> 00:36:55,790
and locked it.

712
00:36:55,873 --> 00:36:58,833
- Then one had one in here like this.
- Then one had one in here like this.

713
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:01,796
And the other.

714
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:03,089
Hey, wait a minute!

715
00:37:03,172 --> 00:37:06,300
In there, and lock that one.

716
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:09,053
And of course, they wouldn't
leave your neck bare.

717
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,305
They always took this strap, and...

718
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:13,622
tightened good and tight around there.

719
00:37:11,388 --> 00:37:13,622
tightened good and tight around there.

720
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:15,893
Ow! Ow!

721
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:18,854
And now you, you little son of a...

722
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,190
You're gonna get kissed.

723
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:24,985
How did you like it?

724
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:26,677
That was torture.

725
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:28,322
Not for me.

726
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,035
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

727
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,663
You wanted to see a newspaper
man at work, didn't you?

728
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:39,166
Well, let me see.

729
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:46,132
Alright, your 16th century.

730
00:37:50,428 --> 00:37:53,848
Spanish.

731
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:58,853
Oh, yeah, this was a manicure parlor.

732
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:04,567
Now, these things, they'd take
and pull your fingernails out.

733
00:38:06,277 --> 00:38:10,948
And no tip to the coat room girl.

734
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:14,243
14th century.

735
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,703
Spanish?

736
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,371
Yeah, thanks.

737
00:38:17,454 --> 00:38:19,540
Enough torture?

738
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:24,044
Mnh-mm.
I could take it.

739
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,990
Well.

740
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:29,990
Well.

741
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,552
Oh.

742
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:32,974
- Not Spanish.
- Not Spanish.

743
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:41,626
All fast?

744
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:41,626
All fast?

745
00:38:41,646 --> 00:38:43,063
All fast!

746
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:45,024
Give it to her.

747
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:51,405
Easy, now.
Easy.

748
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:59,371
That's what we want.

749
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:03,250
Sharks big enough to swallow a man.

750
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:06,128
Capitan, why you fish for shark

751
00:39:06,212 --> 00:39:07,379
when tuna is running?

752
00:39:07,463 --> 00:39:10,090
There's no money in shark.

753
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:12,551
There is for us.

754
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:22,436
Oh, yeah?

755
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,902
Watch it.

756
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,115
We want more like that.
Big ones.

757
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,492
Go aloft, Ortegus.

758
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,452
Ah, si, Capitan.

759
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:50,673
Shark! Off the port bow!
Big one!

760
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,967
I'll say it's a big one!

761
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,219
Slow her down.

762
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,020
Cast off.

763
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:16,448
Straighten your harpoon lines.
We don't want to miss this one.

764
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:24,020
He's a big bruiser.

765
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:24,020
He's a big bruiser.

766
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,333
Easy, Capitan.
Easy.

767
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:32,589
Give it to him.

768
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:35,551
Cast your line!
Shove him in!

769
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,595
He's coming back!
Turn the boat!

770
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,522
Give me that gun, quick.

771
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:04,788
The line! The line!
Cut the line, quick!

772
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,086
He's sounding!
Look out!

773
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,047
He's heading for the bottom!

774
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:18,594
Oh, they're both goners.

775
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:21,555
That big devil's right on top of them.

776
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:24,224
Look out behind you!

777
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,027
He's got him!

778
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,238
Pull in close.
We might save the skipper.

779
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:44,036
Take it easy, boy!

780
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,165
Oh, the leg.
The leg is gone.

781
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,795
Grab it quick, Skipper!

782
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:56,465
Easy now, easy. Easy.

783
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:57,822
We're going down here.

784
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:57,822
We're going down here.

785
00:41:57,842 --> 00:41:59,134
Oh, Capitan.

786
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:04,223
We've got to stop the bleeding!

787
00:42:04,306 --> 00:42:06,975
You're going to be alright now.

788
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,268
Take it easy.

789
00:42:08,352 --> 00:42:11,313
I want to pray.
I want to pray.

790
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:14,942
Cross, Capitan.
Cross, Capitan.

791
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:16,860
You got a cross?
No.

792
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:21,115
Oh, something to pray to.
Oh, my saint.

793
00:42:21,198 --> 00:42:24,326
My saint.

794
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,328
Picture.

795
00:42:26,412 --> 00:42:28,288
Give me picture.

796
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,290
Picture?

797
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:38,173
Candles. Light candles.

798
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:21,592
Don't you men know enough
to take off your hats?

799
00:43:29,224 --> 00:43:31,351
Oh.

800
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,317
Perfect, isn't it?

801
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,652
From where I sit.

802
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:45,115
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if we could go on like this?

803
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,535
We can.
No, we can't.

804
00:43:50,454 --> 00:43:54,374
I got to break a promise to Eli
to tell you something.

805
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,129
I think a lot of you, Joe.

806
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:02,966
So much, I couldn't go without telling you.

807
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:08,096
Break a promise?
Go where?

808
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:12,267
South America, South Seas.
I don't know.

809
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:17,231
He asked me not to tell anybody,
but we're moving on.

810
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:20,567
But when? Why?

811
00:44:20,651 --> 00:44:24,780
Tomorrow, maybe.
I don't know why.

812
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,740
You don't?

813
00:44:28,992 --> 00:44:31,995
Maybe it's better.

814
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,748
I feel we had a whole lifetime of happiness

815
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:39,628
these last two weeks and none of the grief.

816
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:41,672
Let's leave it at that.

817
00:44:41,755 --> 00:44:47,636
Do you really mean that, Julie?

818
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,388
I don't know.

819
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:54,434
No, don't.

820
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:57,354
Afraid?

821
00:44:57,437 --> 00:44:59,856
Yeah.

822
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,697
Yeah, I'm afraid of tomorrow without you.

823
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,411
Why worry about tomorrow?

824
00:45:12,494 --> 00:45:15,622
Oh, why should I think about tomorrow?

825
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:03,503
Ooh!

826
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:14,473
I'll always remember this place.

827
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:18,018
Yeah, and I'll always remember this coffee.

828
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,521
Of course, it could stand
a little cleaning,

829
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:23,440
but I'll get busy on that
today and fix it up.

830
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:25,984
Oh, it isn't worth bothering with.

831
00:46:26,068 --> 00:46:28,779
Want some jam? Yeah, give me the works.

832
00:46:31,114 --> 00:46:32,616
Wait till I get through with it.

833
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,618
It'll be swell here,

834
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:36,912
especially when it rains.

835
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,332
Rains?

836
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:39,706
Yeah.

837
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,502
You know, with the fireplace
going and rain on the roof.

838
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:46,046
Oh, there isn't any fireplace.

839
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:48,548
Well, we'll get one.

840
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:50,052
Where would the cat sit?

841
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:50,052
Where would the cat sit?

842
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:51,510
What cat?

843
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:52,928
The one we're gonna get.

844
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,660
Oh, there isn't any use
putting any money in a cat.

845
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,267
Only have to give it away.
I won't be here much longer.

846
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:01,561
You won't?

847
00:47:05,315 --> 00:47:08,568
I mean, you're going to
some other fishing town

848
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:10,612
and I'm going east.

849
00:47:12,155 --> 00:47:15,158
Have you ever been in Vermont?

850
00:47:15,242 --> 00:47:16,410
No.

851
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,121
The whole place isn't sand and ocean,

852
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:20,414
but earth.

853
00:47:20,497 --> 00:47:22,249
Things grow.

854
00:47:22,332 --> 00:47:24,918
The seasons change once in a while.

855
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:26,461
Things smell better.

856
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:30,465
Around here, everything
smells of dead sardines.

857
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:32,968
This godforsaken seaport.

858
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:37,597
A lot of people like you in every point.

859
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:38,893
Like me?

860
00:47:38,913 --> 00:47:40,142
Yeah.

861
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,477
Always kicking about what they're doing,

862
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:45,731
where they live, why they're
not getting anyplace.

863
00:47:45,814 --> 00:47:50,485
They're always going away
on ships looking for something.

864
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:52,988
Everything you want is right here.

865
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:59,995
Even that book you're writing,
only you can't see it.

866
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,955
You've been living here six years.

867
00:48:02,038 --> 00:48:05,625
I'll bet you you haven't looked
out of those windows once.

868
00:48:07,586 --> 00:48:08,754
Well, you couldn't.

869
00:48:08,837 --> 00:48:11,882
They haven't been washed in six years.

870
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:20,891
C'mere.

871
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:28,648
You can have Vermont.

872
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:35,280
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

873
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:38,867
Men never know what the sea
really looks like.

874
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,952
Women do.

875
00:48:41,036 --> 00:48:42,412
They've looked out there for years

876
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:45,248
waiting for somebody to come back.

877
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:50,337
Joe, I'm not going away.

878
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,671
You're not?

879
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:54,257
I thought you said
you were going with your father.

880
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:56,384
I've changed my mind.

881
00:48:56,468 --> 00:48:59,304
I'm gonna tell him as soon as he gets in.

882
00:48:59,387 --> 00:49:03,850
When does he land?
Tonight.

883
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,060
Where will he dock?

884
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:07,187
Down at the Chinese settlement.

885
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,897
Why the Chinese settlement?

886
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,816
There's no tuna cannery there.

887
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,317
Oh, he's not fishing tuna.

888
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,069
He went south for sharks.

889
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:16,446
South?

890
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,730
How will he feel when he knows

891
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:19,407
you're not going with him tomorrow?

892
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:21,201
He'll kick up a row, I guess,

893
00:49:21,284 --> 00:49:24,538
but I can handle him.

894
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:29,209
Joe, don't you understand?

895
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,420
None of us are going away.

896
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:34,047
Maybe you're right.

897
00:49:37,425 --> 00:49:39,678
I'm not making much headway, Skipper.

898
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,389
Tell them I want to get in before sundown.

899
00:49:42,472 --> 00:49:44,724
Aye-aye, Skipper.

900
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:50,438
Listen, fathead.

901
00:49:50,522 --> 00:49:52,232
We've already given the Coast Guard

902
00:49:52,315 --> 00:49:53,567
one bum steer on Kirk,

903
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,486
and I refuse to let myself in
for another razzing.

904
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,113
Now if you haven't got the real dope,

905
00:49:58,196 --> 00:49:59,406
I won't call them.

906
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,241
Listen yourself, thickhead.

907
00:50:01,324 --> 00:50:03,326
If this isn't the real dope,
then what is it?

908
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,454
First, when everybody's
getting good prices for tuna,

909
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:08,415
Kirk goes south and fishes shack.

910
00:50:08,498 --> 00:50:11,668
Second, he's pulling out
of here tomorrow morning.

911
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:15,088
Third, he's docking at
the Chinese settlement tonight.

912
00:50:15,171 --> 00:50:17,257
Now, don't two and two make four?

913
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,633
Yes, but that makes six.

914
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:20,156
What do the sharks got to do with it?

915
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:21,928
What am I supposed to be, a fortune teller?

916
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:24,556
Maybe it's an excuse for him
to go down below the border,

917
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,891
or it's unnatural.

918
00:50:25,974 --> 00:50:27,654
He's pulling out of here tomorrow morning,

919
00:50:27,726 --> 00:50:29,603
and he's bound to try one last haul.

920
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:30,896
Kirk's no fool.

921
00:50:30,979 --> 00:50:32,335
The minute he sees the Coast Guard,

922
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:33,920
if he's got anything,
he'll dump it overboard.

923
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,109
He did it the last time.

924
00:50:36,192 --> 00:50:38,570
And I thought it took brains
to be an editor.

925
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:40,655
I'll draw you a picture.

926
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:43,909
We all stay under cover
until Kirk ties up at the dock,

927
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:46,703
then we pounce on him and
catch him with his pants down.

928
00:50:46,786 --> 00:50:48,496
And you find a Chinaman in his pants.

929
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,998
Alright, I'll go for it.

930
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,355
But either you bring me back
this story or a piece of rope.

931
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:55,128
Rope? Yeah, so I can tie a can to you.

932
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:56,796
Give me the Coast Guard.

933
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:04,429
Let it go!

934
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:18,360
Take it up slow.

935
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:21,112
Don't bump nothing,
and don't let 'em use any hooks.

936
00:51:21,196 --> 00:51:23,490
I don't want this fish
to be spilling its guts.

937
00:51:23,573 --> 00:51:25,825
Go ahead.
Take it away.

938
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:27,494
Wait a minute, Kirk.

939
00:51:27,577 --> 00:51:30,060
- Hold everything till we tell you. - Hold it.
- Hold everything till we tell you. - Hold it.

940
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,749
Don't you fellows never get
tired of looking me over, huh?

941
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:34,125
Orders, Kirk.

942
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:35,585
Don't miss anything, boys.

943
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:37,462
Well, if you feel like wasting your time,

944
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:39,547
it's alright with me.

945
00:51:54,562 --> 00:51:55,670
Miller of The Standard.

946
00:51:54,562 --> 00:51:55,670
Miller of The Standard.

947
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:56,815
Hello, Miller.

948
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,862
Hello, Kirk.
Good catch tonight?

949
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:05,365
What are you doing on my boat?

950
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:07,867
Looking for that big story I promised you.

951
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:10,036
Nobody comes on my boat
while I'm unloading,

952
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,579
excepting the crew.

953
00:52:11,663 --> 00:52:14,457
It's what comes off your boat
that interests me.

954
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:17,627
You better get out of here
or I'll break your back.

955
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:20,380
From now on, the only thing
you'll break will be rock.

956
00:52:20,463 --> 00:52:22,382
For 20 years...

957
00:52:22,465 --> 00:52:24,592
that's what they give them for smuggling.

958
00:52:24,676 --> 00:52:26,950
- Isn't it, Kirk? - You'll get out of here, do you hear me?
- Isn't it, Kirk? - You'll get out of here, do you hear me?

959
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,849
Okay, tough, remember me?
One-Punch McCoy?

960
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:32,019
Ohh.

961
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:32,019
Ohh.

962
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:33,143
Hey, wait a minute, Kirk.

963
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:38,773
Ah, Christmas has come.

964
00:52:43,486 --> 00:52:44,654
Put that in your pocket.

965
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:46,990
The same to you, and many of them.

966
00:52:56,958 --> 00:53:00,754
Kirk, did you ever read the Bible?

967
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:01,963
What?

968
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:03,506
Someone must have told you

969
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,593
the story of Jonah and the Whale.

970
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:10,722
What do you mean?

971
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:12,265
Just what I said.

972
00:53:12,348 --> 00:53:14,392
Huh. Find anything?

973
00:53:14,476 --> 00:53:16,936
Not this time.
You can go ahead, Kirk.

974
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,148
Pick it up, Jake.

975
00:53:18,168 --> 00:53:19,314
Hey, wait a minute.

976
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:20,565
You didn't find anything?

977
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:22,984
No, just another bum steer, Miller.

978
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:24,861
Don't you ever get anything right?

979
00:53:24,944 --> 00:53:28,490
Oh, all this fuss was his idea, huh?

980
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,075
Yeah, my idea.

981
00:53:30,158 --> 00:53:31,576
Hey, hold that shark!

982
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:34,662
Hey, don't be giving orders on my boat!

983
00:53:41,711 --> 00:53:44,714
Hey, hold!
Hold!

984
00:53:51,888 --> 00:53:53,640
So I never get anything right, huh?

985
00:53:53,723 --> 00:53:54,935
There's nothing on that boat.

986
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:56,184
Not right now, there isn't,

987
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:57,791
but he brought one in and he landed him.

988
00:53:57,811 --> 00:53:58,937
Well, then where is it?

989
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,313
I'm sick and tired of you

990
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:02,315
loudmouthed, half-baked
newspaper reporters.

991
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:04,192
Half-baked, am I?

992
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,445
Has anybody got a knife?

993
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,445
Has anybody got a knife?

994
00:54:05,465 --> 00:54:06,653
Yeah, here's one.

995
00:54:06,736 --> 00:54:09,636
- Thanks. - You might as well admit you muffed this one.
- Thanks. - You might as well admit you muffed this one.

996
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:12,826
Yeah. Well, here's one
nobody can muff.

997
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:17,622
Hey, get away from that shark!

998
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,378
Well, I'll be.

999
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:29,467
Wait a minute, Kirk!
You're under arrest!

1000
00:54:35,723 --> 00:54:37,851
Drop that knife!

1001
00:54:51,614 --> 00:54:54,659
Extra, read about the Chinese smugglers.

1002
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:56,619
Chinese smugglers captured!

1003
00:54:56,703 --> 00:54:59,455
Latest edition papers!

1004
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:22,896
Hello?
Great story, Joe.

1005
00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:25,565
Extra out 10 minutes ago.

1006
00:55:25,648 --> 00:55:28,234
It's the best story to come
out of this town in years.

1007
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,237
It'll hit the front page
of every paper in the country.

1008
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:35,408
I'm raising you $5 a week with a $50 bonus.

1009
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:36,618
Thanks, boss.

1010
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:38,870
If you find Kirk, I'll make it $100.

1011
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:41,831
He's hit pretty hard.
He can't be far away.

1012
00:55:41,915 --> 00:55:44,083
Get down to the waterfront!
Find him!

1013
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:47,295
If you need any help, call on me.

1014
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,088
I got this much of the story without help

1015
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,049
from cops or anybody, including you.

1016
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:52,759
And I'll do it alone!

1017
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:54,427
I'll get the rest of the story.

1018
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,534
I don't want your lousy raise!
I don't want any part of you!

1019
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:57,889
I'll get the story and get out

1020
00:55:57,972 --> 00:55:59,370
and I hope I never see you or your paper

1021
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,934
or this stinking waterfront again!

1022
00:56:01,017 --> 00:56:03,269
That's the stuff, Joe!

1023
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:05,146
Now you are fired.

1024
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,650
Hey, how much rent
do you pay for this place?

1025
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:09,943
Oh, get out, will you?

1026
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:12,362
No, I'm just getting in.

1027
00:56:12,445 --> 00:56:13,947
You're getting out.

1028
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:16,908
But before you go, speak to
Phelps about me for your job.

1029
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:18,785
Oh, you can have it.
You can have this place.

1030
00:56:18,868 --> 00:56:22,664
You can have anything connected
with the waterfront I've got.

1031
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:27,210
You mean you're really going?

1032
00:56:27,293 --> 00:56:29,629
Yeah, going just as far as I possibly can

1033
00:56:29,712 --> 00:56:32,131
and try to forget what
a mess I've made of things,

1034
00:56:32,215 --> 00:56:34,133
particularly myself.

1035
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:37,428
Well, in that case, I'll give you this.

1036
00:56:37,512 --> 00:56:40,306
I opened it. Well, what does it say?

1037
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:42,976
It's from Brattleboro, Vermont.

1038
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:48,648
"Joe, dear, since you are the
dearest friend I have," stop.

1039
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:50,900
"I want you to be the first to know

1040
00:56:50,984 --> 00:56:54,654
I am engaged to Walden Morgan," stop.

1041
00:56:54,737 --> 00:56:58,199
"Affectionately,
Bernice."

1042
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,833
It's a tough break, kid.
I'm sorry.

1043
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:09,836
Oh, you don't have to be.
I wasn't in love with her.

1044
00:57:09,919 --> 00:57:12,714
Oh? No, it was just one of those things.

1045
00:57:23,057 --> 00:57:25,749
That was a great story.

1046
00:57:23,057 --> 00:57:25,749
That was a great story.

1047
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:28,479
Yeah, tough break on Julie.

1048
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:30,189
She believed in me.

1049
00:57:30,273 --> 00:57:32,233
Listen, call Phelps
and tell him you're sick.

1050
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:34,821
I'll finish the story.

1051
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:34,821
I'll finish the story.

1052
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:34,821
I'll finish the story.

1053
00:57:34,841 --> 00:57:37,363
No, I can't stop now,
Mac, you ought to know that.

1054
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:39,699
It's a great story.

1055
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:41,015
I wish I'd done it.

1056
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:41,015
I wish I'd done it.

1057
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,285
And I wish you had.

1058
00:57:42,368 --> 00:57:45,455
I wish anybody in the world
had done it but me.

1059
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:03,056
Well, "meow" yourself.

1060
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:07,143
Come on.
Well, come on.

1061
00:58:07,226 --> 00:58:09,020
Hello, there.

1062
00:58:09,103 --> 00:58:11,564
Hello, there.

1063
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:14,400
Say, I got a job for you.

1064
00:58:14,484 --> 00:58:15,943
Yes.

1065
00:58:16,027 --> 00:58:19,364
How would you like
to sit beside a fireplace, huh?

1066
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:24,619
Oh, just the warmest,
coziest fireplace you ever saw.

1067
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,704
Now, look, isn't that good? Miss Kirk!

1068
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:28,247
What do you want?
You come.

1069
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:29,791
Your father hurt bad.

1070
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:34,504
He say get doctor. Doctor?
What's happened to him?

1071
00:58:34,587 --> 00:58:37,340
What happened to him?

1072
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,777
I brought you the doctor, Eli.

1073
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,779
How does it look, Doc?

1074
00:58:59,862 --> 00:59:02,073
I shall have to remove the bullet.

1075
00:59:02,156 --> 00:59:03,449
Have you got the tools?

1076
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:06,869
Yes, but I have no anesthetic.

1077
00:59:06,953 --> 00:59:08,704
Well, I have plenty of that.

1078
00:59:08,788 --> 00:59:10,623
Go on and get started.

1079
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:11,958
Let's have done with it.

1080
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:14,293
Make a light for me.

1081
00:59:26,347 --> 00:59:28,433
There it is.

1082
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:31,060
How did it happen?

1083
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:33,980
That black-legged reporter
put the police onto me

1084
00:59:34,063 --> 00:59:38,568
and they caught me with the goods.

1085
00:59:38,651 --> 00:59:41,051
What reporter?

1086
00:59:38,651 --> 00:59:41,051
What reporter?

1087
00:59:41,071 --> 00:59:43,489
Miller.

1088
00:59:43,573 --> 00:59:46,534
Miller?
Yes, Miller.

1089
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:47,827
Somebody tipped him off

1090
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,872
where I was gonna land the stuff tonight.

1091
00:59:57,336 --> 01:00:00,214
Somebody did.

1092
01:00:00,298 --> 01:00:02,675
I'm going to get across the border.

1093
01:00:02,758 --> 01:00:04,510
Get me a motorboat.

1094
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:08,806
Yeah. Don't you worry.
I'll take care of all that.

1095
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:11,100
We've both got to get out of here.

1096
01:00:11,184 --> 01:00:12,977
You can't go with me, Julie.

1097
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,646
Oh, I've got to, Eli.
I can't stay here.

1098
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,857
Why? Why?

1099
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:23,488
I... I trusted somebody.
I thought I was in love.

1100
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:25,304
Love?

1101
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:25,304
Love?

1102
01:00:25,324 --> 01:00:27,074
Yeah, I made a mistake.

1103
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:29,660
Who is he?
Nobody.

1104
01:00:29,744 --> 01:00:32,121
Nobody that matters.

1105
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:34,874
You've always told me everything.

1106
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:37,335
It's one thing I can't ever tell you.

1107
01:00:37,418 --> 01:00:39,170
Light a little closer.

1108
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:42,590
This may hurt.
You hold still.

1109
01:00:44,926 --> 01:00:46,677
Hold it!

1110
01:00:51,224 --> 01:00:52,934
There.

1111
01:00:57,271 --> 01:01:00,191
It looks kind of like a cross, don't it?

1112
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:01,734
Give it to me.

1113
01:01:03,736 --> 01:01:06,739
Might come in handy later on.

1114
01:01:06,822 --> 01:01:10,952
No. No, he's gonna be
alright, isn't he, doctor?

1115
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:14,247
Chances are not good.
for going in boat.

1116
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:19,794
If I can get up that ladder,
I'm going tonight.

1117
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,672
Must go very easy.
You have hemorrhage.

1118
01:01:22,755 --> 01:01:24,924
You die. No, no, no. No, you won't.

1119
01:01:25,007 --> 01:01:26,300
You won't, Eli.

1120
01:01:26,384 --> 01:01:28,803
You just lie quiet.
We'll get away alright.

1121
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:30,098
You get that boat ready.

1122
01:01:30,118 --> 01:01:31,347
Yeah.

1123
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,933
Get in provisions enough for four days.

1124
01:01:34,016 --> 01:01:36,269
You be quiet now and don't worry.

1125
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,171
Julie, I...

1126
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,171
Julie, I...

1127
01:02:01,191 --> 01:02:02,295
What do you want?

1128
01:02:02,378 --> 01:02:05,381
I want to tell you
something. Tell me nothing.

1129
01:02:05,464 --> 01:02:09,468
You told me. You don't
like the waterfront.

1130
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:11,137
Things don't grow here!

1131
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,097
No, not like you they don't!

1132
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,725
Maybe not. But I'm sorry
I had to drag you in.

1133
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:17,518
Me?
Never mind about me!

1134
01:02:17,602 --> 01:02:18,894
It's him!
No, it isn't.

1135
01:02:18,978 --> 01:02:20,501
That's my job, and he had it coming to him.

1136
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,315
It's you!
I loved you.

1137
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:24,150
I didn't know it, but I know it now.

1138
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:28,029
You love me?
Oh!

1139
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,406
You just went after me to get my father!

1140
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,074
That's why you're here now.

1141
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:33,556
You think I know where he is and you think

1142
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:35,036
they'll find him.
They will.

1143
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,039
But I came here to get
one thing clear in your head.

1144
01:02:38,122 --> 01:02:39,957
Last night was on the level.

1145
01:02:40,041 --> 01:02:42,001
I loved you, and I'll always love you.

1146
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:44,170
Don't talk about love.

1147
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:47,214
You've been digging around the
muck of the waterfront so long,

1148
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:50,384
nothing means anything to you
but your dirty job!

1149
01:02:50,468 --> 01:02:52,011
You think you're gonna find Eli?

1150
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,429
Well, try it.

1151
01:02:53,512 --> 01:02:56,140
If you do, they'll find
you dead in the harbor.

1152
01:02:56,223 --> 01:02:57,873
Oh, for goodness...

1153
01:02:56,223 --> 01:02:57,873
Oh, for goodness...

1154
01:02:57,893 --> 01:02:59,560
Yeah, and that'll be okay with me, too.

1155
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:01,354
Now get out of here.

1156
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:15,826
I guess you lost your job.

1157
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:33,946
How does that feel?

1158
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:38,909
Kind of hot.

1159
01:04:38,993 --> 01:04:42,663
You don't shoot as straight as you spit.

1160
01:04:42,747 --> 01:04:44,498
Straight enough.

1161
01:04:44,582 --> 01:04:49,545
You'll never write no more
stories about me.

1162
01:04:49,628 --> 01:04:51,964
Oh yes, I will.

1163
01:04:52,047 --> 01:04:56,427
I'll still write your obituary.

1164
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,304
No, you won't.

1165
01:04:58,387 --> 01:05:01,849
I'll be over the border by sunrise.

1166
01:05:04,602 --> 01:05:10,107
Yeah, but not the Mexican border.

1167
01:05:12,485 --> 01:05:15,571
You're pretty game, ain't you?

1168
01:05:15,654 --> 01:05:19,283
You just won't quit, will you?

1169
01:05:19,366 --> 01:05:21,911
Not till I'm through.

1170
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,335
Come on, Eli.

1171
01:05:29,418 --> 01:05:32,338
I've got the boat.

1172
01:05:32,421 --> 01:05:35,132
Eli.

1173
01:05:35,216 --> 01:05:36,884
Eli, are you alright?

1174
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:39,762
Sure.

1175
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:42,306
What's the matter with him?

1176
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:44,475
I shot him.

1177
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:45,935
You shot him?

1178
01:05:46,018 --> 01:05:48,229
He had it coming to him.

1179
01:05:51,232 --> 01:05:53,609
He's right, Julie.

1180
01:05:53,692 --> 01:06:00,115
I gave you a pretty raw deal.

1181
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:01,867
Is he the man?

1182
01:06:04,286 --> 01:06:06,038
Yeah.

1183
01:06:14,588 --> 01:06:17,842
No, no, Eli.
You can't do that.

1184
01:06:17,925 --> 01:06:20,010
What's the use?

1185
01:06:20,094 --> 01:06:23,472
Come on. Come on,
we've got to get away.

1186
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:34,692
You'll never make it, okay?

1187
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:40,865
You can't even get up those...

1188
01:06:40,948 --> 01:06:42,533
stairs.

1189
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:49,081
We can't leave him, Eli.

1190
01:06:53,335 --> 01:06:57,673
If nobody came, he... he might die here.

1191
01:07:04,013 --> 01:07:05,764
I can't leave him.

1192
01:07:19,612 --> 01:07:21,238
Where are we going?

1193
01:07:21,322 --> 01:07:24,450
None of your business.
Come on.

1194
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,420
Eli, you got twisted in the fog.

1195
01:07:36,503 --> 01:07:38,172
We're back home!

1196
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:40,215
Take her outside, you made a mistake.

1197
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:43,719
No mistake.
Not this time.

1198
01:07:43,802 --> 01:07:46,889
Get a doctor to get that
bullet out of the kid there.

1199
01:07:46,972 --> 01:07:49,433
You did it on purpose.

1200
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:52,227
If you love him, he's worth it.

1201
01:07:52,311 --> 01:07:53,981
It's more than I ever was.

1202
01:07:52,311 --> 01:07:53,981
It's more than I ever was.

1203
01:07:54,001 --> 01:07:55,689
Eli!

1204
01:07:55,773 --> 01:07:58,817
Eli!

1205
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,362
Oh, no!

1206
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,656
Eli!

1207
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:35,604
Is that the only tune you know?

1208
01:08:35,688 --> 01:08:39,108
It's very appropriate.

1209
01:08:39,191 --> 01:08:40,943
Say, what's the matter with you?

1210
01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:42,569
Have you got writer's cramp?

1211
01:08:42,653 --> 01:08:43,862
All the time in the world

1212
01:08:43,946 --> 01:08:46,865
and you haven't written
one line of your novel.

1213
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:49,285
I didn't feel like writing.

1214
01:08:49,368 --> 01:08:51,453
Besides, I'm stuck for a finish.

1215
01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:54,039
Well, why not end it very abruptly

1216
01:08:54,123 --> 01:08:58,544
and call it "The Romance
of the Fisherman's Daughter"?

1217
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,715
That'll be enough of that.

1218
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:05,175
Well, that romance ended
very abruptly, didn't it?

1219
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:08,470
Oh, shut up, will you?

1220
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:11,223
I don't see any roses around here.

1221
01:09:11,306 --> 01:09:12,891
I didn't expect any.

1222
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:14,395
Have a crutch.

1223
01:09:12,975 --> 01:09:14,395
Have a crutch.

1224
01:09:14,415 --> 01:09:15,853
Thanks.

1225
01:09:15,936 --> 01:09:18,188
Women are all alike.

1226
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:22,464
- Not all of them. - Sure, they are.
- Not all of them. - Sure, they are.

1227
01:09:22,484 --> 01:09:23,736
When you need them most,

1228
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:26,613
they are conspicuous by their absence.

1229
01:09:26,697 --> 01:09:28,949
Oh, come on, let's get out of here.

1230
01:09:29,033 --> 01:09:30,117
I'm for that.

1231
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,454
The smell of ether intoxicates me.

1232
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:50,345
Hey, are we in the right house.

1233
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:52,389
Yep.

1234
01:09:52,473 --> 01:09:55,017
Well...

1235
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,811
Oh, if you could only cook.

1236
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:03,108
Hey, what's this thing, a desk?

1237
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:04,359
Futuristic.

1238
01:10:04,443 --> 01:10:07,029
What do you think I am, a society editor?

1239
01:10:08,655 --> 01:10:11,992
Where's the Pekinese that goes with it?

1240
01:10:12,076 --> 01:10:14,661
Don't you like it?
Like it?

1241
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:18,457
I think it's the...

1242
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:32,786
You did this?

1243
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:32,786
You did this?

1244
01:10:32,806 --> 01:10:34,056
Yes.

1245
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:37,643
Why?

1246
01:10:37,726 --> 01:10:39,978
Well...

1247
01:10:40,062 --> 01:10:43,398
I had something to say to you, and...

1248
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:47,778
this is my way of saying it.

1249
01:10:47,861 --> 01:10:50,489
You like it?

1250
01:10:50,572 --> 01:10:51,990
I think it's swell.

1251
01:10:52,074 --> 01:10:54,159
Well, it's too bad you
won't be around to enjoy it.

1252
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:56,620
You won't find a desk
like that in the East.

1253
01:10:56,703 --> 01:11:00,999
You go East, young man.
Go East.

1254
01:11:01,083 --> 01:11:02,668
I got it.

1255
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,512
I've always liked fireplaces.

1256
01:11:13,595 --> 01:11:16,890
Yeah, they're awfully nice when it rains.

1257
01:11:24,148 --> 01:11:25,566
Jerry.
No.

1258
01:11:25,649 --> 01:11:28,527
No, Jenny.
Oh.

1259
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,529
I beg your pardon.

1260
01:11:34,074 --> 01:11:35,617
You know, I've...

1261
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:39,538
I've never seen that old harbor
look so beautiful.

1262
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:42,624
Maybe that's because
the windows are washed.

1263
01:11:46,753 --> 01:11:48,589
I've got the finish for my novel.

1264
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,007
What is it?

1265
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:55,053
He marries the girl.

1266
01:11:56,722 --> 01:11:59,433
That's a swell finish.

1267
01:11:59,865 --> 01:12:09,865
