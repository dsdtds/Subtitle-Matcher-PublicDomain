1
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,880
this is the Battle of China

2
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:33,390
this the great city of Shanghai on a

3
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,390
September day in 1937

4
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,659
this the fearful beginning of a new kind

5
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,659
of war

6
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:47,739
this first mass bombing from the air of

7
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,739
a helpless civilian population

8
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:58,949
why hire these innocent Chinese men

9
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,370
women children to die beneath the hail

10
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,228
of Japanese bombs to find the answer to

11
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,550
this question we must first understand

12
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:11,250
something about China and Japan and to

13
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,469
understand China three facts must never

14
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:23,909
be forgotten

15
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:29,430
China is history China is land China is

16
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:33,349
people Chinese history goes back for

17
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,700
more than 4,000 years that's a long time

18
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,469
it was only a hundred and sixty-eight

19
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:39,560
years ago that Washington crossed the

20
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,560
Delaware

21
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:46,250
only 452 years of passed since Columbus

22
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,250
discovered America

23
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:54,229
it's 1,500 years since the world saw the

24
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,359
fall of the ancient Roman Empire 3400

25
00:02:54,229 --> 00:03:00,709
years have gone by since Moses received

26
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:04,340
the Ten Commandments 3,700 years have

27
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:06,889
passed since the pyramids were built but

28
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,289
more than four thousand years ago the

29
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:11,919
Chinese Empire was already in existence

30
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:15,468
and more important so was the Chinese

31
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:21,409
civilization a civilization of art and

32
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:25,759
learning and peace yes China is history

33
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:28,250
and China is also land more land than

34
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,979
the entire continent of Europe a third

35
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,729
larger than the United States and rich

36
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,729
in raw materials

37
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,878
this vast area consists of China proper

38
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:44,840
and for outer provinces to the north is

39
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:49,759
Manchuria huge and desolate but

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,230
abounding in raw materials next to

41
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:57,500
Manchuria our Mongolia and Sinkiang

42
00:03:53,229 --> 00:04:01,098
here lies the Gobi Desert a vast plateau

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,860
twice the size of Texas inhabited by

44
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:05,929
nomads tribes who lead their camel

45
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,810
caravans back and forth over ancient

46
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:14,269
trade routes to the West is Tibet the

47
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,829
icy roof of the world its borders

48
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,280
encompassing the eastern end of the

49
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:22,490
Himalayan mountains the mystery land

50
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,409
that few have entered and from these

51
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,418
vast mountains of the West rise the

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,639
three Great Rivers the northernmost of

53
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:31,399
these is the playing ho the Yellow River

54
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,829
far to the south flows sea Kiang the

55
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,219
Pearl River which enters the sea past

56
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:38,870
the great ports of Canton and Hong Kong

57
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:43,190
but the greatest river of all is the one

58
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,288
that flows between the Yangtze winding

59
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:48,319
for 3,000 miles through the heart of

60
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:50,959
China bringing fertility to the good

61
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:55,038
earth and bearing upon its broad waters

62
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,769
half the Commerce of China yes China is

63
00:04:55,038 --> 00:05:02,149
land next to Russia the largest country

64
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:07,120
in the world but most important China is

65
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:07,120
people 450 million of

66
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:29,318
if the whole population of China would

67
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:31,628
walk past you for a breast there would

68
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,819
never be an end to the procession for

69
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:38,439
new Chinese would be born and would grow

70
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:40,509
up before the last man could pass by of

71
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:44,259
every five persons on the face of the

72
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:46,419
earth one is a Chinese and since

73
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,819
one-fifth of all the human beings in the

74
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:51,788
world are Chinese we should know what

75
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:54,098
sort of people they are well in all

76
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:56,218
their 4000 years of continuous history

77
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:59,699
they have never waged a war of conquest

78
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:01,689
they're that sort of people they

79
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,259
developed the art of printing from

80
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:07,629
movable type they invented the Mariners

81
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:10,000
compass without which no ocean could be

82
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:12,908
cross they were among the first

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,949
astronomers and their observations of

84
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,978
the stars and planets made possible the

85
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:20,770
accurate measuring and recording of time

86
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:23,348
they are that sort of people and why do

87
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,120
we call our dishes China because the

88
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:28,149
Chinese invented the art of making

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,788
porcelain and as we all know they

90
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:33,028
invented gunpowder not as a weapon of

91
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:33,028
war

92
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:41,079
but to celebrate their holidays and

93
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:43,808
religious festivals and it was one of

94
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,938
China's great philosophers who 500 years

95
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:49,149
before the birth of Christ gave mankind

96
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:53,020
these words what you do not want done to

97
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:55,689
yourself do not do to others they are

98
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:59,348
that sort of people enriching the world

99
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:04,110
in which we live yes China is incredibly

100
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:06,938
old incredibly big incredibly pop just

101
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,550
yet it was until recently a land with

102
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:16,149
which few of us concerned ourselves but

103
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:18,639
now a great change has taken place China

104
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:21,728
is now our fighting hour or more

105
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,189
accurately we are China's for China has

106
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:26,399
been fighting our enemy Japan for seven

107
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:26,399
long years

108
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,599
why is this why if the Chinese when all

109
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:36,360
their 4000 years of history have never

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,919
waged an aggressive war then forced to

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,280
fight the fight who died by the millions

112
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:49,319
because China is land 4 million square

113
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:52,349
miles and because China is people 450

114
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,769
million of them and because Japan had a

115
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:58,070
plan to use them both that plan was

116
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:01,560
finally stated in the Tanaka memorial a

117
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:04,259
blueprint for world conquest formulated

118
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,889
in 1927 by Baron de Shi Tanaka the

119
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,800
Japanese Foreign Minister in order to

120
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:14,668
conquer the world we must first conquer

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,439
China here was their mad dream phase 1

122
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:19,409
the conquest of Manchuria for raw

123
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:22,829
materials phase 2 the absorption of

124
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,740
China for manpower piece by piece so as

125
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:28,589
not to arouse the rest of the world

126
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,978
phase 3 a triumphant sweep to the south

127
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:34,769
to seize the riches of the Indies Bay is

128
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:39,718
for the eastward move to crush the

129
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:42,000
United States one fact was obvious China

130
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,640
was to be the giant back on which Japan

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,080
would ride to world conquest just as

132
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:51,689
Russia was to be enslaved for German use

133
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,450
but how was it possible for Japan only

134
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,420
one twentieth the size of China and with

135
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:00,020
only one-sixth its population to think

136
00:08:57,419 --> 00:09:03,599
of conquering China much less the world

137
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:06,088
there were two main reasons for this in

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,459
the first place modern China in spite of

139
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:11,250
its age-old history was like the broken

140
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:13,588
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle each piece

141
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,500
controlled by a different ruler each

142
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:19,589
with his own private army in modern

143
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,720
terms China was a country but not yet a

144
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,050
nation

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,730
while Japan was a united well nip highly

146
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:30,769
regimented military dictatorship second

147
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,649
reason lies in the uses each country

148
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:37,759
made of our Western civilization let's

149
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:39,730
see what China took you will notice that

150
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,199
this is a very old piece of film

151
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,480
actually it is more than 30 years old

152
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:49,429
and it shows a very great man by the

153
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,589
name of soon yat-sen in 1911 this man

154
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:53,088
fathered a People's Revolution which

155
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,579
brought to an end China's ancient

156
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,490
Imperial government and began its new

157
00:09:55,578 --> 00:10:00,769
era as a modern Republic winning for

158
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,750
himself in Chinese history as secure of

159
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,990
place as George Washington has in ours

160
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,639
and he and his followers chose for the

161
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,100
cornerstone of their new republic

162
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,339
Chinese words that echoed those of

163
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:16,370
another believer in democracy government

164
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:18,350
of the people by the people for the

165
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,679
people and to make these principles

166
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:25,939
become reality they built more schools

167
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,500
and colleges they establish scholarships

168
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:29,688
so that their young men and women could

169
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,089
go forth to the universities of America

170
00:10:29,688 --> 00:10:36,558
and Europe and bring back to their own

171
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,600
country other Western ideas and this new

172
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:42,669
generation returned to China with new

173
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:47,449
techniques of Industry architecture

174
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:49,370
science medicine they built more

175
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:52,039
hospitals to free their people from the

176
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,730
blight of disease they introduced

177
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,860
compulsory education they laid down as

178
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,019
essential two of the four freedoms for

179
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,970
which we fight today freedom of

180
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,970
expression and freedom of religion

181
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,860
in 1925 Sun yat-sen died but his

182
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:15,189
disciples led by Chiang kai-shek carried

183
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,759
on his monumental work their aim the

184
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,620
unification and modernization of China

185
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,679
Chinese industry was old-fashioned and

186
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,740
inefficient transportation was slow and

187
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,419
inadequate but now railroads began to

188
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,779
link the great seaports and river

189
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:34,000
harbors with the inland cities a network

190
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:37,079
of Highways began to stretch beyond the

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,220
railroad lines into the deep interior

192
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,889
after leaving them untouched for

193
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:45,540
centuries China was beginning to use her

194
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,539
vast store of raw materials

195
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,120
and soon the tools and machines of the

196
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,300
new factories were delivering the goods

197
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,370
and products for China's new economy for

198
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:04,189
the Chinese believed in using the best

199
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,159
of Western civilization so the progress

200
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,710
of their country and while they were

201
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:12,159
building this new nation just a day and

202
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:15,670
a half by steamer across the Yellow Sea

203
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,669
lay Japan

204
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:20,979
here the god Emperor and his fanatic

205
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,748
warlords were using this same Western

206
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,629
civilization for one purpose and only

207
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:30,528
one to create one of the world's most

208
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:32,808
powerful war machines their aim the

209
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:36,188
absorption of China and the fulfillment

210
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:36,188
of the Tanaka memorial

211
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,000
for years Japan had deliberately copied

212
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:54,360
military weapons and industrial

213
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,759
techniques discovered in other countries

214
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,460
for years Japan under the pretext of

215
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,700
lacking raw materials for industry had

216
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,200
been buying in every corner of the world

217
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,480
materials not only to build this war

218
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,250
machine but materials which could be

219
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,840
stored to feed it in the war of conquest

220
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,879
they were planning for years while other

221
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,269
nations were trying to outlaw war by

222
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:21,809
reducing armaments Japan was feverishly

223
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:26,649
and secretly building a modern army a

224
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:28,809
modern Navy a modern Air Force to strike

225
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,679
its infamous blow at the civilized world

226
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:35,319
and we all now know about the islands in

227
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,829
the Pacific that Japan fortified in

228
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,240
violation of all international treaties

229
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:43,060
these were the reasons why F was

230
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,730
possible for Japan only one twentieth

231
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:48,250
the size of China and only one-sixth the

232
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,889
population of China to think of

233
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,629
conquering China as the first step to

234
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:57,909
world conquest and as you have seen in

235
00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:01,379
1931 they embarked on phase one the

236
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,379
occupation of Manchuria

237
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:07,689
the small bonfire that the Japanese live

238
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:10,328
in Manchuria was to grow and spread with

239
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,290
uncontrollable fury until the entire

240
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:13,289
world was aflame

241
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,879
phase 1 if the Tanaka plan was completed

242
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,009
and exactly as planned

243
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,899
the Japs have been confident that this

244
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:32,579
first and sudden land grab could be

245
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,370
accomplished without their becoming

246
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:38,458
involved in a major war and they were

247
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,528
right the unification of China was still

248
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,929
too remote for the Chinese of the south

249
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:44,568
to care what happened to their kinsmen

250
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:48,149
in the north

251
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:49,828
using the step-by-step technique a few

252
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,309
months later the Japs took a crack at

253
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:52,309
Shanghai

254
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:01,459
but Chinese resistance was so great they

255
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,830
hastily called that deal off waited

256
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,290
another year and then struck in the

257
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,050
north again carving the province of gay

258
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:13,819
whole' out of China proper this too they

259
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:17,659
got away with the world criticized the

260
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,940
Chinese protested but still the Japs got

261
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:23,750
what they wanted another piece of China

262
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:25,700
and without a war on their heads and to

263
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,769
rule over Manchuria and yaho

264
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,450
the Japs then set up a puppet government

265
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:33,579
under their stooge

266
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:36,350
Henri puyi the Chinese Quisling Prince

267
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,180
but the leaders of new China remembered

268
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,540
that in other centuries other barbarians

269
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:44,059
had invaded their country the evidence

270
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:46,099
still stood in the great wall built by

271
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:49,219
their ancestors more than two thousand

272
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,889
years earlier and stretching for 1,400

273
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,779
miles across mountain and desert to

274
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,289
protect themselves from the barbarians

275
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,289
of the north

276
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:02,679
of the Great Wall it has been said that

277
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,980
it is the only work of man which would

278
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:08,169
be visible from the moon but the Chinese

279
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,870
knew that modern barbarians can't be

280
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:14,740
stopped by a wall however strong are

281
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:20,460
high they can't even be stopped by

282
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,460
people unless the people are united

283
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:28,310
and by 1937 the unification of China was

284
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,730
making such progress the Japs got

285
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:34,879
worried the one weapon they could not

286
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,159
permit China was unity they would strike

287
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,850
again before China cat become a nation

288
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:42,889
this time it would be a big bite five

289
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:46,519
more northern provinces out of a heart

290
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:48,710
of China at the United States Embassy in

291
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,230
China as military attache for a number

292
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,570
of years was Colonel William mayor let

293
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,399
him tell you what happened the first

294
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,460
thing the Japs did was to prepare their

295
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:00,199
usual fake alibi this time it wasn't a

296
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,410
damaged railway track as it had been in

297
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,360
Manchuria in 1931 a [ __ ] soldier had

298
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:08,180
disappeared obviously he'd been

299
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,818
kidnapped by the insolent Chinese once

300
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,670
more Japan's honor had been insulted

301
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:16,789
once more the insult must be avenged so

302
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,970
on the night of July 7th 1937 at the

303
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:22,990
Marco Polo Bridge near Peking the jack

304
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,990
war machine struck

305
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,379
within the space of a few weeks the

306
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:36,500
invaders were in control of Tinson and

307
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:43,490
Bay pain it looked as if the Japs are

308
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:45,890
going to have another walkover now the

309
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,259
Japs sat back to digest and organized

310
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:51,380
this new conquest the peace-loving

311
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:53,750
Japanese didn't want a war if they could

312
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,310
get their land grabs without one but

313
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:01,279
this time they were in for a rude

314
00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:07,000
surprise this time instead of protesting

315
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:07,000
and negotiating the Chinese struck back

316
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:15,109
and not in the north but at shanghai

317
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,109
where the Japs least expected

318
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,540
to understand the fighting that followed

319
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:28,500
we must know something about the city of

320
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:30,659
Shanghai itself situated near the mouth

321
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,130
of the Yangtze River it is the biggest

322
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:37,110
city in China as the largest seaport in

323
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,990
the Far East it dominated the commerce

324
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:42,059
and foreign trade of China and through

325
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,299
its great docks and channels passed most

326
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:48,980
of the wealth of the Orient inshallah I

327
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,980
truly the East met the West

328
00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:00,240
and within this city of three and a half

329
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:03,899
million Chinese was another city the

330
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,589
foreign settlement made up of the French

331
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,570
Concession

332
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:09,139
and the well-known international

333
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:11,519
settlement there the various powers

334
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,420
including Great Britain the United

335
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:20,750
States and Japan at station 2 catchments

336
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:24,900
of troops Japanese British French and

337
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,309
our own United States Marines to assist

338
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,040
the police of the Shanghai Municipal

339
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:31,289
Council in the preservation of peace and

340
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,539
order and to protect the boundaries of

341
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,359
the International Settlement these

342
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,730
detachments were limited in size but the

343
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,099
Japs secretly and in violation of all

344
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,990
treaty agreements that increased their

345
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,669
Garrison's so that when fighting started

346
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,670
on the border of their concession in

347
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:50,930
August of 1937 they thought they were

348
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,930
fully prepared for any eventuality

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,079
the force of the Chinese counter-attack

350
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,570
almost drove the Japs into the Wankel

351
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,119
River backed up by the heavy guns of

352
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:19,480
their warships however the Japs managed

353
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:21,889
to hold out until reinforcements arrived

354
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,380
[ __ ] landings were then made in the

355
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,690
vicinity of the Woosung forts and in

356
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:31,520
lieu ho and lo tian on the Yangtze River

357
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:33,529
north of Shanghai the Chinese drew back

358
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,720
to positions five or ten miles inland

359
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:39,160
where they could secure some protection

360
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,160
from the heavy [ __ ] naval gunfire

361
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:57,829
at the same time the invaders succeeded

362
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,799
in making a surprise landing some 20

363
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:03,500
miles to the south of Shanghai put two

364
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,759
divisions short and pushed rapidly north

365
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,759
to our flank the city

366
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:18,209
the Chinese position was thus made

367
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,519
untenable

368
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,920
under withdrawal was ordered to the west

369
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:25,799
and to the south toward Nanking and

370
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,720
Hangchow but only about half of the

371
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,039
Chinese army that had fought at Shanghai

372
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,259
was left to withdraw

373
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,210
meanwhile enraged at the very idea of

374
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:39,029
anyone resisting the Imperial Japanese

375
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,340
might the Japs took their vengeance upon

376
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:44,279
the civilian population of the city a

377
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:46,829
city without guns or planes to defend

378
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,970
itself and deliberately slaughtered

379
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:49,970
thousands from the air

380
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,559
the some there was refuge inside the

381
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,480
International Settlement where Japan was

382
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,730
afraid to bomb the property and people

383
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,730
of the foreign powers just yet

384
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:06,950
there was not room for all for each who

385
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,259
found safety inside there were thousands

386
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,269
huddled beyond the gates standing

387
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:13,670
helpless and undefended against the

388
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:15,920
Chaput acts

389
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,210
there was no escape for these surging

390
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,210
and panic-stricken people

391
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,259
they could only scurry through the

392
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,990
narrow streets pushing and packing

393
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:26,980
themselves into the center of the city

394
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,048
to be exact

395
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,220
buried alive in the collapse of bombed

396
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:32,220
and burning buildings

397
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:24,710
thus for Japanese introduced the world

398
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:24,710
to a new kind of war

399
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:37,509
a war of deliberate terrorization of

400
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:40,048
deliberate mass murder of deliberate

401
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,048
frightfulness

402
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,298
when the campaign was over the Japs

403
00:24:55,169 --> 00:25:00,390
occupied the entire peninsula east of

404
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:03,048
Shanghai reorganizing rapidly they then

405
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,340
launched a coordinated drive on Nanking

406
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:07,490
one column pushed along the railroad

407
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:10,769
while another swung further to the south

408
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,370
this column then split and continued its

409
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:13,349
drive

410
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:15,329
hoping to cut off any possible to

411
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:19,709
retreat of the Chinese armies defending

412
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:21,658
Nanking it was here in the Yangtze that

413
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,470
the blood-crazed Japs attacked an

414
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:28,789
American gunboat the USS Panay

415
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,788
despite its distinctive markings

416
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:41,519
the ship was bombed and sunk with the

417
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:43,528
loss of American lives the first

418
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,528
American warship to go to the bottom in

419
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:48,479
this war but officially at least this

420
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:51,419
was a mistake and the Japanese

421
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:53,999
government apologized meantime at

422
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:56,340
Nanking Chinese armies valiantly

423
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:59,778
defended their city which was the

424
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:59,778
capital of the Chinese Republic

425
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:03,779
but again Japanese power was too great

426
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,150
and after a battle lasting but a few

427
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,149
days the city fell to the invaders

428
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:25,240
their occupation of Nanking the chaps

429
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:27,369
again outdid themselves in barbers the

430
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:33,700
helpless populace was tapped by the city

431
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:37,349
walls he did not flee Japanese soldiers

432
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:41,279
went for certain they raped and tortured

433
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:41,279
they killed and butchered

434
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,460
in one of the bloodiest massacres of

435
00:27:54,249 --> 00:28:01,110
recorded history they murdered 40,000

436
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,110
men women children

437
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:33,430
but those who live might better have

438
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:37,239
died for the horror of their twisted and

439
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:39,130
porn bodies was worse than death these

440
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,289
scenes were photographed by an American

441
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:45,030
missionary and smuggled out of China

442
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:45,029
after the rape of Nanking

443
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:55,460
this nightmare of cruelty was all the

444
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,559
more horrible because it was

445
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,259
deliberately planned by the Japanese

446
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:04,509
High Command to tear the heart out of

447
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:04,509
the Chinese people once and forever

448
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:18,710
and then it happened that which soon

449
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:21,950
yat-sen had dreamed of that which Chiang

450
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,319
kai-shek at toiled for that which is

451
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:28,029
stronger than stone walls had at last

452
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:31,389
been born in China the will to resist

453
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:31,389
ten Yemen

454
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,650
in their last bloody blow the Japanese

455
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:52,319
that accomplished what 4,000 years had

456
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,679
failed to bring into being a united

457
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,678
China

458
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:33,529
but the Chinese knew that the will to

459
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,359
resist was not by itself enough they

460
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:38,509
knew that China must develop the power

461
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:41,629
to resist also and this cannot be

462
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:44,839
created in an instant so they too made a

463
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:47,450
plan and it was this they would slowly

464
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:49,849
yield territory piece by piece

465
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,160
while they developed the power and built

466
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:55,219
the weapons to rid the land of its

467
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,769
invaders the industrial strength of

468
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,069
China must be moved to the west beyond

469
00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:03,829
the mountains beyond the railroad lines

470
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:06,379
beyond the lines of communication they

471
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:08,599
are safe from enemy attacks they might

472
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,240
produce the rifles and guns that China

473
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:14,859
so tragically needed

474
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:20,140
thus China would trade space for time

475
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:20,139
space for time blow up the roads

476
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,390
space for time sports the earth

477
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,289
space for time blow up the factory

478
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,289
building

479
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:45,240
leave nothing to the invaders

480
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,308
and then the people rose and moved

481
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:54,308
riding walking crawling

482
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,210
thirty million of them spontaneously

483
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:17,429
driven by an epic impulse rose and made

484
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:19,798
their way west the earth teeming with

485
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:21,960
them moving westward on a trek that

486
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:24,598
stretched through two thousand miles of

487
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,038
road less wilderness thus the world

488
00:32:24,598 --> 00:32:29,398
witnessed one of the most amazing

489
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:34,138
spectacles in human history the greatest

490
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:36,449
mass migration ever recorded whatever

491
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:38,338
could be abuse and could be moved the

492
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,509
Chinese took with them on a Homeric

493
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:46,108
journey their libraries their schools

494
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:49,769
their hospitals all dismantled and

495
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:52,769
carted away the machinery from over a

496
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:55,618
thousand factories weighing over 300

497
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:59,659
million pounds was moved away in trucks

498
00:32:55,618 --> 00:33:04,638
and ox carts and on their banks

499
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:07,200
2,000 miles away 2,000 miles west

500
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:09,778
wherever they could they gathered along

501
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,389
the few remaining railroads waiting

502
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:15,358
hoping for some chance to ride part of

503
00:33:12,388 --> 00:33:17,338
the way toward their westward goal and

504
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:19,408
when they attacked the last train with

505
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:22,888
the last ounce of humanity and machinery

506
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:27,028
the tracks themselves were taken up rail

507
00:33:22,888 --> 00:33:31,608
by rail tie by tide to be transported

508
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:31,608
westward to leave nothing for the enemy

509
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,820
every river pointing westward was heavy

510
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:57,340
late every sampan every bar was pressed

511
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:59,529
into service weighted down to the

512
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:02,039
water's edge with the precious tools for

513
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,039
new China

514
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:14,009
nothing could stop not even the rivers

515
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,240
that narrowed in the mountain gorges

516
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:19,470
westward with their loads of machinery

517
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,469
more precious than gold

518
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:28,050
progress was measured by the mile by

519
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,970
feet by inches the trail had broke this

520
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,000
noise and every step of the way by their

521
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:35,730
sweat where there were no trains no

522
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,789
boats no ox carts there were still

523
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:43,219
willing hands and willing feet straining

524
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:46,529
backs 30 million people moving west

525
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:52,159
westward from the invader westward from

526
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:52,160
slavery and death westward to freedom

527
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,610
now in the free mountain lands of the

528
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,110
West

529
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:36,900
ancient cities sprang in fresh and

530
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:42,210
modern life chief of them all was the

531
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:44,220
new capital of free China Chongqing here

532
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,829
on the cliffs high above the Yangtze

533
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:49,619
River the Chinese had reestablished

534
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,480
their government they knew however that

535
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,819
the people of the city would not be safe

536
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,130
from [ __ ] air raids the memories of

537
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,740
Shanghai were fresh in their minds and

538
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:01,380
in the sandstone cliff on which the city

539
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:03,269
is built thousands of workmen rushed the

540
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,220
construction of enormous caves as

541
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:07,920
shelters for the people and for the

542
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:13,079
pitifully few machines more important

543
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,880
than life to the Japs Chongqing became

544
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,069
the heart of the Chinese nation they

545
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,230
were determined to conquer destroyed

546
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,220
Chongqing and they would break the

547
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,219
spirit of new China

548
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:37,539
as they could reach the city by land

549
00:37:34,929 --> 00:37:40,679
they would send their bombers to blast

550
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,679
it from the face of the earth

551
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,849
against these Japanese are modest slow

552
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:23,460
and obsolete Chinese planes made a

553
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:23,460
suicidal attempt to defend Chongqing

554
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:15,649
but neither Japanese planes nor Japanese

555
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:18,500
mugs can destroy the life of the city

556
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,170
but not only the people but the

557
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,179
factories have gone underground where

558
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,329
the vital machines could operate by day

559
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:28,659
and by night safe from bombs and

560
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,660
strapped

561
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:42,950
this time the Chinese had anticipated

562
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:46,068
their enemy in spite of bombs and fire

563
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:48,969
and destruction this time the Chinese

564
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,969
stood fast

565
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:05,809
blaming chongqing became the symbol of

566
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,809
their indestructible spirit

567
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:22,449
and now the cold ones sounded throughout

568
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:26,739
new China and from the past interior

569
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:26,739
China's millions answered the call

570
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:38,460
they came from the south and from the

571
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:45,149
north from the east from the West the

572
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:46,019
form of People's Army with a new faith

573
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,780
in their hearts

574
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:50,789
men and women left their homes and farms

575
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,369
to fight for something bigger now than

576
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:56,159
each man's home and each man's farm in

577
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,849
each man's life they were fighting for

578
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,848
new China

579
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:16,440
new soldiers awkward and unskilled like

580
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:18,710
all new soldiers but I toughened and

581
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,710
trained

582
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:37,349
they learned the discipline and order of

583
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:43,670
drill they knew they must strike and

584
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:43,670
strike hard they learned to kill

585
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:49,789
the youth of trying also came forward

586
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:52,940
training to care for the sick and the

587
00:42:49,789 --> 00:43:01,778
wounded girls joined their husbands

588
00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:04,670
brothers and sweethearts in uniform and

589
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:06,798
to the aid of China came volunteers from

590
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:08,568
other lands men who pledged themselves

591
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:12,199
to fight against tyranny and oppression

592
00:43:08,568 --> 00:43:13,909
no matter where Americans like the

593
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:17,328
legendary Colonel Charlotte and his

594
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:20,149
Flying Tigers who were there few

595
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:23,210
American planes were knocking down enemy

596
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:27,950
planes of the fantastic ratio of 20 nips

597
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:29,809
to one of their own had hoped to ride

598
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:32,899
the world conquest on the back of the

599
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:34,880
giant Chinese workhorse Phase two of the

600
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,309
Tanaka plan called for breaking the

601
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,680
horse to their will but the great

602
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:44,420
patient horse refused to be broken the

603
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:48,078
enraged [ __ ] saw their whole plan of

604
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:50,690
conquest bogging down so they set out to

605
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,460
drain the Giants strength by cutting the

606
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,489
arteries through which flowed China's

607
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,548
lifeblood of supplies they penetrated

608
00:43:55,489 --> 00:44:00,650
along the rivers railroads destroyed by

609
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:03,349
the Chinese were rebuilt with slave

610
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,960
labor as the Japanese moved inland

611
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:07,530
secured control of key rail lines and

612
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,289
important communications

613
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,210
and China's supply lines from the

614
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:14,789
outside world were cut off by [ __ ]

615
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:17,099
warships blockading the coast the

616
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:22,769
Japanese strategy was the isolation of

617
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:24,509
China port after port was occupied this

618
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:26,460
meant China was being cut off from

619
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:29,100
supplies she couldn't manufacture for

620
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:33,809
herself supply as she was getting from

621
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:37,110
her Western friends without oil gas guns

622
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:39,000
and planes china was doomed with the

623
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,740
whole of the chinese coast in the hands

624
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,690
of the chance there would only be two

625
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:45,929
roofs over which to bring the vitally

626
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:48,389
necessary materials from Indochina a

627
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:51,089
narrow gauge railway ran inland from the

628
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:53,639
sea to kun Ming connecting with a truck

629
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,190
road that went to Chongqing but its

630
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,259
capacity was limited and then there was

631
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,570
the old trail of the camel caravans from

632
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:03,360
Russia across the Gobi Desert which

633
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,039
could bring in even less not only did

634
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,380
these routes provide too little for

635
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,019
China's needs but they were too near [ __ ]

636
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,360
territory to be safe there was only one

637
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:14,070
other possibility in Burma was a

638
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,309
railroad that ran from the port of

639
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:19,860
Rangoon to Lazio separating it from the

640
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:21,809
truck road at Kunming were hundreds of

641
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,760
miles of high mountains and deep river

642
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:26,130
gorges

643
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,930
if this stretch of tortuous mountain

644
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:31,050
trails could be replaced by a modern

645
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:33,509
highway where now only pack trains could

646
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:36,300
pick their plodding way China would have

647
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:40,170
a practical supply route to Burma and

648
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,210
the sea several internationally known

649
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,000
firms of Engineers were called in to do

650
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:47,820
the job they said the work might be

651
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,230
completed in six or seven years if China

652
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,900
could supply them with the most modern

653
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:54,179
machinery but China didn't have the

654
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:57,059
modern machinery nor did she have the

655
00:45:54,179 --> 00:46:00,889
six or seven years so she began building

656
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:00,889
the road with her bare hands

657
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:25,090
by thousands by tens of thousands by

658
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:27,490
hundreds of thousands they toiled at the

659
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,650
back-breaking pass of carving this

660
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:32,819
desperately needed supply line out of

661
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,820
the reluctant madness

662
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:06,769
and out of their toil and their sweat

663
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:08,930
they created the Burma Road not in six

664
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:12,289
or seven years but in less than twelve

665
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:15,230
months a monument for the new spirit to

666
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:17,329
the new China as soon as it was

667
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,990
completed the road went into immediate

668
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:19,989
service

669
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:31,659
by thousands the truck shuttled back and

670
00:47:27,608 --> 00:47:36,748
forth between its terminals climbing to

671
00:47:31,659 --> 00:47:39,519
nearly 10,000 feet around hairpin curves

672
00:47:36,748 --> 00:47:42,218
along the edges of sheer precipices

673
00:47:39,518 --> 00:47:44,518
we're passing trucks had barely 1 foot

674
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:44,519
of clearance

675
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:51,110
the blood plasma of new supplies flowed

676
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:54,019
steadily over China's lifeline to the

677
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:57,320
sea protected by Colonel Chennault

678
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:59,389
incredible Flying Tigers the Chinese

679
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,970
sacrifice cannot be measured only in

680
00:47:59,389 --> 00:48:03,799
miracles of construction that must be

681
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:06,559
counted too in the tragedy of

682
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,200
destruction for while still the Burma

683
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,869
Road was being built the invading

684
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:13,759
Japanese had fanned out and straddled

685
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:16,039
fully two-thirds of the railroad lines

686
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,380
of the country in the summer of 1938

687
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:20,779
they set out to capture the remaining

688
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,869
one-third starting with the vital

689
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,640
railroad junction at Chang Chau change

690
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:26,269
how is situated on the banks of the

691
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:29,659
Yellow River

692
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:32,090
China's sorrow originally the river

693
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:34,849
flowed from Chang Chau southeast way to

694
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:37,670
the Yellow Sea but nearly a century ago

695
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:38,239
a great flood abruptly changed its

696
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,570
course

697
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:44,029
swinging it far to the north for

698
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:47,000
generation upon generation as the spring

699
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:49,010
floods rushed down to the sea thousands

700
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,409
of Chinese worked on the dikes to hold

701
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:54,640
the river in its new course protecting

702
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:54,639
their homes and their crops

703
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:03,650
now as the Japs advanced on Cheng Chao

704
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:06,220
the Chinese blew up the southern dike of

705
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,220
the Yellow River

706
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:11,920
thus loosing a flood between themselves

707
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,920
in the jacks

708
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:22,309
once more the river flowed in it's old

709
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:24,559
course forming a barrier which to this

710
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:28,299
day was prevented the [ __ ] from

711
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,299
entrenching himself in this area

712
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:36,569
thus once more with no thought of the

713
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:44,730
human sacrifice of the material cost the

714
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:46,800
Chinese traded space for time and the

715
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:50,099
Chinese had still other tricks to pull

716
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,660
from their patched and faded sleeves you

717
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,549
will notice that this map of [ __ ]

718
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:55,739
conquests doesn't look like the military

719
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:58,289
Maps you have seen in the previous films

720
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:00,449
by all military standards it should have

721
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:03,750
looked like this which is the way the

722
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:05,609
Japs wanted it to look but the Japanese

723
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,670
were learning that the occupation of

724
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:12,090
Chinese cities and control of Chinese

725
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:14,530
rivers and railroads still was far from

726
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,420
meaning the subjugation of China

727
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:19,300
but the Chinese have formed themselves

728
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:22,150
into guerrilla bands trained to Harris

729
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,820
the [ __ ] forces these guerrillas were

730
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,559
mostly farmers who had stayed behind on

731
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:30,210
the land when the great migration to the

732
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:33,610
west took place peaceful farmers one day

733
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:37,980
deadly fighters the next they made an

734
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:37,980
unpredictable and uncontrollable enemy

735
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:58,720
the chaps sell the lines of

736
00:50:56,289 --> 00:51:01,420
communications but in the pockets thus

737
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:03,959
formed these uncomfortable guerrillas

738
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:06,820
constantly sniped at the [ __ ] invaders

739
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,579
when the Japs tried to annihilate them

740
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:12,360
they disappeared only to reappear in

741
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:12,360
another pocket

742
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,210
tender

743
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:37,079
attacking with speed and surprise they

744
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:37,079
ambushed enemy patrols

745
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,870
the Japanese were fighting more than the

746
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:55,650
Chinese people they were fighting the

747
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:59,420
Chinese land the great distances the

748
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:02,280
rivers the floods the swamps and marshes

749
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:05,760
these two were enemies that defied the

750
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,580
[ __ ] war machine the giant back Japan

751
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,740
intended to ride to world conquest was

752
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:14,369
proving to be a bucking bronco

753
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:16,619
phase two of the Tanaka plan had fogged

754
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:19,380
down in what the Japs still referred to

755
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:22,679
as the China incident this left them in

756
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,440
a fateful quandary phase two of the

757
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,989
Tanaka plan was still incomplete but

758
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,590
phase 3 in phase 4 could no longer be

759
00:52:27,989 --> 00:52:33,479
delayed in Russia the overwhelming

760
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:36,480
German offensive was taxing Russia's

761
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,130
military capacity to the limit removing

762
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,219
any Japanese fear of Russian

763
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:43,230
interference Britain after the

764
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:45,629
sledgehammer blows of Dunkirk in the

765
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:48,990
Battle of Britain was left groggy and

766
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:51,690
militarily almost exhausted her Navy

767
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:55,349
scattered across the seas guarding her

768
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:57,420
lifeline of supplies but here in America

769
00:52:55,349 --> 00:53:01,529
we were finally awakening to our danger

770
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,970
and taking steps to protect ourselves we

771
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:05,519
had appropriated funds for the

772
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:09,009
construction of a two ocean Navy and our

773
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:11,769
army was rapidly expanding

774
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:14,530
if the ultimate objectives of the Tanaka

775
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:15,608
plan were to be achieved now was the

776
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:18,820
moment to strike

777
00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:22,480
now when Russia was otherwise occupied

778
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:25,050
now before Britain could recuperate now

779
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,960
before we could gather too much strength

780
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:32,200
so the Japs made a fateful decision they

781
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,090
would embark on phase 3 and phase 4 the

782
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:36,730
conquest of the Indies in the United

783
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:39,250
States without waiting to complete phase

784
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:42,550
2 the conquest of China

785
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:46,090
thus the paralyzed American power in the

786
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:50,130
Pacific without warning as they have

787
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,130
always struck they struck again

788
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:02,849
according to all the rules China's

789
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:06,039
position should now be greatly improved

790
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:09,159
for inner war with Japan China now had

791
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:12,400
fighting allies ourselves the British

792
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:16,960
the Dutch but it didn't work that way

793
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:20,740
for China for in those tragic early

794
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,750
months of 1942 when we sustained defeat

795
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:25,079
after defeat at the hands of our common

796
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,079
enemy

797
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:36,449
China endured the worst setback of all

798
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:38,750
out of our defeat China lost the Burma

799
00:54:36,449 --> 00:54:38,750
Road

800
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,460
but still china's courage never faltered

801
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,260
her determination never weakened and in

802
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,139
the history of those long and tragic

803
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:56,100
months of black defeat in 1942

804
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:59,879
one bright page stands forth the page

805
00:54:56,099 --> 00:55:03,029
written by our Chinese Eliza here is the

806
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,700
city of Changsha the Japs wanted it for

807
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:08,190
two reasons it was in the center of the

808
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:11,159
Chinese rice bowl and it was also an

809
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:13,440
important railway Junction place before

810
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,379
they have tried to take it and twice

811
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,090
before they have been thrown back

812
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:21,840
massing a large striking force near yo

813
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:23,760
choke on Christmas Eve 1941 the Japs

814
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,579
started southward toward Shanghai and

815
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,740
three columns of three points during the

816
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:31,469
drive south the Chinese forces put up

817
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:33,839
token resistance but instead of

818
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:36,529
withdrawing toward Changsha they

819
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,880
withdrew east into the mountainous flank

820
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:41,460
by New Year's Eve the Japs had

821
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,079
surrounded the city they quickly pierced

822
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,720
the outer defences and attacked the

823
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,819
inner defenses from four directions in

824
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:49,799
spite of fierce resistance the Japs were

825
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,960
certain of the fall of Changsha was only

826
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,760
a matter of hours what they didn't know

827
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,730
was that they had walked into a well

828
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,290
baited trap for the Chinese forces which

829
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,230
had withdrawn into the hills

830
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:03,380
now swept down on the [ __ ] supply light

831
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:06,360
he cut them to ribbons

832
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:09,119
the [ __ ] forces attacking the city soon

833
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,070
ran out of food and ammunition and began

834
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,420
a withdrawal

835
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:14,490
whereupon the Chinese launched a

836
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:18,110
