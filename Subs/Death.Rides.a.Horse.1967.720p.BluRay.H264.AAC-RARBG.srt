1
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,979
You better watch out. That gang's around here.

2
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:02,978
Yeah. With what we've got
in the cart, 200,000 dollars,

3
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,982
then we'd better keep our eyes open.

4
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:08,994
- Here, this will warm you up.
- Great. We can use it.

5
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:13,778
- I'm going back now. You stay on guard here.
- Don't worry.

6
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,004
- He goes to his nice warm house while <i>we...
- </i> Shut up.

7
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:29,794
- I wish it was tomorrow already.
- Let's have a drink.

8
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,731
- Hey, did you hear anything?
- Yeah, I heard you gurgling down that bottle.

9
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,174
I heard it. Let's go take a look.

10
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,243
Jack? Pat?

11
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,359
John? John!

12
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,414
That's all. Let's go.

13
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,646
Well, let's get going.

14
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,663
Yah! Yah!

15
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,590
15 years, ain't nobody seen you laugh.

16
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,589
As for me, I understand you.
Ain't no laughing matter to be in jail.

17
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:19,383
But you can laugh today
because today different. I'm telling you, today is a big day for you.

18
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:24,388
You know something, you go out of here with that face,
the first thing you know, you're gonna be right back again.

19
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,723
Come in.

20
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,729
Come in, Ryan.

21
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,663
When I look at you, it doesn't seem
so many years have gone by.

22
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,753
At least, not for you.

23
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:33,331
It seems it was only yesterday
that we met for the first time.

24
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,761
Here's the 83 dollars
you had in your pocket 15 years ago.

25
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,766
Yeah. I hope it helps
you get started again.

26
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,780
My gun.

27
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,797
Thank you.

28
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,806
- Now the bullets.
- The bullets?

29
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,811
15 years ago, you put 'em
in one of those bottom drawers there.

30
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,832
27. You have a good memory.

31
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,746
Well, sometimes it's not difficult.

32
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,835
I still had 6 in my gun and 21 in my belt.

33
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,427
If they hadn't double-crossed me,
the count would be a little bit different.

34
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,476
Here you are. Beautiful horse, isn't he?
Take it from me, he's worth the 60 dollars.

35
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,056
Hey! Come back here! Hey!

36
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,094
What can I do for you?

37
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,681
I haven't been around here in quite
a while. Everything's changed.

38
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,107
Your parents?

39
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,112
That was my entire family.

40
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,028
I'm sorry.

41
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,117
I heard about it some time ago.

42
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,189
Ah. Hi, Bill.

43
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:56,114
I'm glad you're in town.
I wanted to speak with you.

44
00:19:56,404 --> 00:20:00,904
I've just been talking to the judge and he goes along with me.
Now how would you like to be deputy sheriff?

45
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,205
I know that the job doesn't pay much,
but I'm gonna retire before long

46
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,130
and then you'll move up a step.

47
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,918
What do you say Bill? It's time you settled down. I've noticed
that there's something between you and Betsy.

48
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:20,798
I've got other things on my mind, sheriff,
for the time being.

49
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,139
Bill, no one knows you better than me.

50
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,153
I was a good friend
of your mother and father.

51
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,937
I know what's on your mind now,
but don't you think it's about time to forget it?

52
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,236
Thanks anyway, sheriff.

53
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,428
Over here.

54
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,021
What's going on?
Who's doing that shooting? Open up!

55
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,374
Come on in.

56
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:18,462
- What's going on? Night target practice?
- Oh!

57
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,472
Somebody tries to shoot me in the back,
I defended myself.

58
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,387
You defend yourself
almost too well, mister.

59
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,476
They're both dead as doornails.

60
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,404
They came in the window.
It wasn't to wish me pleasant dreams.

61
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,414
Ok, ok, self-defense, I guess.

62
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,407
But in this town we don't like violence.

63
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm asking you to get out of town
as quickly as possible.

64
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,506
Good morning, Bill.
How many glasses have you got in the house?

65
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,431
- A couple.
- Can we dirty them?

66
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,510
I want to have a little talk with you.

67
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,541
What brings you all the way out here?

68
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,549
What's on your mind?

69
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,560
This.

70
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,475
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That my memory is still pretty good.

71
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:12,275
Now I've thought about this all night. Whether
what I'm about to do is the right thing.

72
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:18,281
But I've known you
for too many years to keep quiet.

73
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,591
Where'd you find them?

74
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,598
On a dead man's feet.

75
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,682
Who?

76
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:46,309
Last night, two men were killed.
Those were on one of them.

77
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,534
- Who killed them?
- A stranger.

78
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:55,318
A certain Ryan. He went west.

79
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,690
Alright, stand up.
Don't turn around.

80
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,703
Keep your hand away from your gun.

81
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,716
If you're gonna follow somebody youngster,
do a better job of it.

82
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,641
This world is full of nervous characters.

83
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,640
They'll shoot you in the back first
and then introduce themselves.

84
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,654
Tell me what you're after.

85
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,727
15 years, there's been no new track.

86
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,741
Only a spur.

87
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,745
Then you come along
and there's three spurs.

88
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:13,330
If you know the story, then you can
figure out what I'm looking for.

89
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:17,671
We've both got an account
to settle with the same people.

90
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:22,465
- Only I want to take first crack at them.
- We can go on together.

91
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,470
No, son, you got too much hate in you.
Sooner or later, that's gonna get you in trouble.

92
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,766
Hate's hate. There's no two ways.

93
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:39,356
Somebody once wrote that revenge
is a dish that has to be eaten cold.

94
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,703
Hot as you are,
you're liable to end up with indigestion.

95
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,703
No, I'm going on alone.

96
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:52,495
- You better shoot me.
- Do I have to?

97
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:58,501
If you don't, I'm gonna end up
on your heels again.

98
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,796
Yeah, I suppose so.

99
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,803
Important thing is to get there first.

100
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:12,389
That's why I'm gonna leave your horse
at Red Rock, that's ten miles from here.

101
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:18,521
An advantage you're gonna
have to give me. Good luck, son.

102
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,830
You might need that.

103
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,887
Whiskey and water.

104
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,816
Where do I find Cavanaugh?

105
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,905
Another drink?

106
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,905
I'm looking for Burt Cavanaugh.

107
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,919
Look, friend...

108
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,922
<i>l'm</i> selling whiskey.

109
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,933
Thanks for the information.

110
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,944
Hold it. What do you want up here?

111
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,971
Ryan.

112
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,980
Well, this certainly is a surprise.

113
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,984
Was it a good surprise or a bad surprise?

114
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,989
Why? Did you think
I wasn't happy to see you?

115
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,905
How much did you give those two
to get rid of me?

116
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,915
I don't think I understand what you mean.

117
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:25,708
It doesn't make much difference. Whatever
you paid, it was a bad investment.

118
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,028
I should kill you.

119
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,958
Or maybe I have learned something
after all these years.

120
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,958
As an example, even a rat like you

121
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,051
could be worth more alive than dead.

122
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,629
Look Ryan, I know it was not a nice trick
walking out on you at the trial, but...

123
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,971
No, no, no.

124
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:20,763
You didn't walk out on me, you sold me.
You turned me in. There's a big difference.

125
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,979
Look, it was a long time ago.
Why don't we drop it?

126
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:29,072
Here. Here's 100 dollars.

127
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:34,651
I know it's not much,
but business hasn't been good lately.

128
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,992
- 100 dollars?
- Yes.

129
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,076
100 dollars for 15 years in jail?

130
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,075
Maybe I was right in the beginning.

131
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:54,671
- Maybe a rat like you is better dead.
- All right, don't get excited, Ryan.

132
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,012
- What do you want?
- 15,000.

133
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,804
- What?
- 15,000; 1,000 for every year in jail. Cash.

134
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:06,099
Where am I going to get my hands
on that kind of money?

135
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,108
Oh, you'll find it.

136
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,027
I'm sure you'll find it.

137
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:23,826
I'm not in a hurry.
Tomorrow morning will be all right.

138
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,708
It warms my heart
to see all my old friends doing so well.

139
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:36,049
You're all pretty well established,
aren't you?

140
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,053
I'm gonna visit our friend in Lyndon City.

141
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:43,056
See what the first citizen
has to say for himself.

142
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,140
Till tomorrow. <i>Oh...</i>

143
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:50,727
Watch out for these things.
Wouldn't want you to get hurt.

144
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,145
Not yet.

145
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:22,179
- Bad luck at the table, friend?
- Not bad luck, mister.

146
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:27,764
It was robbery.
They took everything I had.

147
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,105
You look like you need a drink.

148
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,108
You don't understand.
That was just a warning.

149
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:38,111
They got all my money,
but I wanna keep my skin.

150
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,115
Sure you do. Who said anything different?

151
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:44,118
- I can't go back in there.
- Come on.

152
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,211
No. I don't want to. No, no, no.

153
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,210
I don't wanna get killed.

154
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,218
Listen, they'll kill me. Do you hear?

155
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,230
Two whiskeys.

156
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:17,814
- How much did you lose?
- 30 dollars.

157
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,244
What are you doing? Are you joking?

158
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,246
Drink.

159
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,260
Thanks

160
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,268
well, take the dough. And beat it.

161
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,273
I never leave without finishing my drink.

162
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,309
That should take care of it.

163
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,894
Alright, stranger, I'm putting you under arrest,
and charging you with attempted homicide.

164
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,235
Means you can be put in prison
for ten years.

165
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,239
- When can we try this man, judge?
- Tomorrow!

166
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,332
Take him to jail.

167
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,329
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

168
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,333
Hold it!

169
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,920
If I'm worth anything as a witness,
I'd say this is a case of self-defense.

170
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,274
More than anything I've seen in my life.

171
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:21,063
Based on the personality of the witness,
the charge is hereby withdrawn. The prisoner may go. Cards.

172
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,944
You were lucky. Just get out of here now.
I want to talk with our friend here.

173
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:33,366
Well, young man, you're a faster draw
than all those stupid idiots.

174
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:39,956
If you're looking for a job, I may
be able to help. Come up to my office.

175
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,452
Hands behind your head, son.

176
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,464
Now let that hammer down. Slow.

177
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,478
At ease.

178
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,482
You still got a lot to learn, son.

179
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,487
This time you got something to learn, too.

180
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,491
Oh?

181
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,494
What?

182
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,497
Cavanaugh's paying me 500 dollars
to kill you.

183
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,423
- Another bad investment.
- You think so?

184
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:51,213
- Maybe I didn't take him seriously.
- If you didn't, you'd have been right.

185
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:56,218
But tell me, why does he want you killed?
And who is Cavanaugh?

186
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,439
You ask too many questions.

187
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,518
I can pay for the information with his 500.

188
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,526
He's worth more than that to me. 15,000.

189
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,531
So I suggest you keep your distance.

190
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,446
'Cause if you don't,

191
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,544
I might get mad.

192
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,541
That's a warning.

193
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:40,136
I'll find out who he is.
And if he's who I think he <i>is...</i>

194
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,563
get ready to get mad.

195
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,488
Hey! Hey, wait a second.

196
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:04,497
Wait. I wanna thank you. Yes, sir.

197
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:09,291
I ain't worth much and it's been a real
spell since anybody's done anything for me.

198
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:14,296
But if you asked me to walk on fire, mister,
I'd just started walking.

199
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,511
I might ask you a lot less.

200
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,604
Like what you know about Burt Cavanaugh.

201
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:26,182
- How long's he lived here in Holly Spring?
- When I got here mister, he was already boss of the place.

202
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,313
But if you want to know more about him,
well I just know the right man.

203
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,608
Get yourself a good, strong bottle of rum,

204
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,615
'cause the more this man drinks,
the more he talks.

205
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,623
All the sheep are gone,
and the pastor lies sleeping alone.

206
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,629
The bottle. The bottle!

207
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,552
Better drunk than dead, I always say. Here's to you.

208
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:59,642
Bottoms up.
Now tell me what you know about Burt Cavanaugh.

209
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,562
- That's my drunken wife. Shh!

210
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:08,561
If there's any alcohol a mile away,
she smells it.

211
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,565
The bottle. Where's the bottle?

212
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,568
- There isn't any bottle.
- Where is the bottle?

213
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,571
I know you've got some.

214
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:21,584
- There it is.
- But it isn't ours. It's his.

215
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:26,368
My good man, forgive the impression you're
getting of us. It's just that she's my wife.

216
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,674
She's a bit... the poor woman's a drunk.

217
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,672
<i>Uh...</i> Before you finish that off,
tell me about Cavanaugh.

218
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:40,256
Cavanaugh. I'll tell you.
He's a scorpion, he's a snake, a beast!

219
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,597
All right, let me tell it.

220
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,600
When I first arrived here,
the church was in good order.

221
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,694
I was an upright preacher then too.

222
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,691
- But what about him?
- What about who?

223
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,614
- Cavanaugh.
- Oh, Cavanaugh.

224
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:59,612
All he had was
a pistol and a pack of cards.

225
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,696
And you know, now he's called... four aces.

226
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,633
- Full house. Queens.
- Not enough. Full house, Aces.

227
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:20,723
Poor man. The ladies love you
but not lady luck.

228
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,636
- Give me another chance Cavanaugh.
- What security have you got?

229
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,646
You know I've lost it all.
You've taken everything I had.

230
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:37,439
My farm, my cattle, everything.
You know that.

231
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,744
Then get out of here. You're using space.

232
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,742
Only 500 dollars.

233
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:49,325
Just give me a chance, that's all I ask.
Just 500 dollars.

234
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,755
- Who wants to come in the game?
- I do.

235
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,772
My employees don't play.

236
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,783
Deal the cards.

237
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,754
How many?

238
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,843
I stand.

239
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,842
I'm happy to take your 500.

240
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,848
Four aces.

241
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,851
Me, too. Four aces.

242
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,438
Look, young man,
I'm afraid I don't feel like joking.

243
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,859
Neither do I.

244
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,880
Remember, Cavanaugh,
15 years ago at the Mesita Ranch?

245
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:08,464
You and your friends killed everybody.
But you forgot one thing:

246
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,885
To kill me.

247
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,901
Give him a gun.

248
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,907
Get up!

249
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,916
Piano player, hit three notes.

250
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,911
Two lessons, my son.

251
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,910
First, watch behind you.
Second, count your shots.

252
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,004
Four bullets for one man, that's a waste.

253
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,008
I'll go and drive away his horse.

254
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,021
Hey!

255
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,041
Damn.

256
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,051
Hey!

257
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,966
- Listen, are you the man in charge of this here place?
- Yes, sir. What is it?

258
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:03,055
- What time's the train leave for Lyndon City?
- It just left 15 minutes ago.

259
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,984
- What time's the next one leave?
- The day after tomorrow.

260
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,983
Ah-ha! Come on, keep calm my boy.
Your pal left your horse with me.

261
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,986
- He took the train, huh?
- Sure. But that's not all.

262
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,990
This guy told me a pal of his would be coming along.

263
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:21,783
He said I should give you the horse
and a kiss. The horse is there waiting for you.

264
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,998
Now, where do you want that kiss?

265
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,092
No, thanks. I'll settle for the horse.

266
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,669
I am proud indeed to be here today,
and I consider it a great honor

267
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,800
to introduce to you
our leading banker, Mr. Walcott.

268
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,068
There is more. Yes.
Senator Carlyle has kindly agreed

269
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,858
to have the Atchison-Santa Fe line
pass through our enterprising growing little town!

270
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,740
Which augurs a fine,
prosperous, up-and-coming future...

271
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,090
Citizen, while I'd be delighted
to continue to address you,

272
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,170
I must go because duty calls me.

273
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,177
Hooray for Senator Carlyle!
Hooray for Lyndon City!

274
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,121
One is here and
the other will be here very soon.

275
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,210
That's the one who killed Cavanaugh.

276
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:33,209
Well, go on and get Pedro and Paco and the others.

277
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:39,125
Just say that I decided
the party is for nine. Hello.

278
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,215
Nothing else. The boys'll get it.

279
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:47,223
Walcott, a stranger's asking for you.

280
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,228
Show him in, then.

281
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:01,239
Easy, friend.

282
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,243
You're all alike.

283
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:13,249
Years go by and you all do the same things.

284
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:18,254
Gun in the drawer, knife in the back. Lies.

285
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:23,259
You were afraid that I
wouldn't receive you?

286
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,184
Quite the contrary.

287
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:30,182
I expected you to receive me too well.

288
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:33,266
So I figured it's safer
to come in from behind.

289
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,274
Walcott, that stranger's gone.

290
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,199
I'm already here, friend.
So you can go on out.

291
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:47,989
Close the door behind you.
This is a private talk.

292
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,294
The door!

293
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:58,294
Well... looks like you've become important.

294
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,222
And rich.

295
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:09,221
You've changed your old clothes,
haven't you?

296
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,305
But you still haven't been able
to change your face, have you?

297
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,233
You still got the meanest-looking face
I ever did see.

298
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,323
- Now listen, Ryan...
- Shut up.

299
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,901
And I can tell you where I've been
all these years, because of you.

300
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:31,237
I've seen some mean faces. Plenty of them.

301
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:34,247
Things aren't the same as they used to be.

302
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,250
Because I can pay now.

303
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:40,343
Just sit down. We'll talk about it.

304
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:47,344
There isn't that much talking to do.

305
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,258
Just five words.

306
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:54,346
Fifteen thousand plus fifteen thousand.

307
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,345
15,000 bucks doubled?

308
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,938
A lot of money, Ryan.
It's a pretty high figure.

309
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:08,069
But not for 15 years in jail.
And you'll have to pay Cavanaugh's share.

310
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:13,074
He was killed right under my nose and
I didn't get a chance to collect the money.

311
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,956
I'll give you an advance now.
How about... 10,000 bucks?

312
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,384
All right.

313
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,389
The rest tomorrow.

314
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,473
Now it's my turn.

315
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,504
All right?

316
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,507
Hold it.

317
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,431
Don't kill him yet.

318
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:36,509
He's useful to us for the time being.

319
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:47,523
We could finish you off now.
But that would be too simple.

320
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,438
Let me tell you this, boys.

321
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,446
- Ryan was sent to us by heaven.

322
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:58,239
Yes, good old Ryan is going to be helpful to us
like in the good old days.

323
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,541
Wait.

324
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:23,138
I've been working at this for years,
building their confidence in me,

325
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,559
the citizens as well as
the governor of this state.

326
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:32,147
But the most important thing is, believe it or not, I have
in my bank more than a million dollars now.

327
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:39,154
The funds the state deposited with me
in view of our future public works.

328
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,502
What do you think?

329
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:49,290
Should I build
their stupid old public works

330
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,585
with this mountain of dollars?

331
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,514
Well, they don't think I should.

332
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,602
I guess I'll have to go
along with their idea.

333
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,622
Whoa.

334
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,632
You make sure you don't lose him.

335
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,653
- Ah, Mr. Walcott.
- Yes. Good evening, Frank.

336
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:05,240
- Some extra work, Mr. Walcott?
- Frank, go and open the door back there while I close this one.

337
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,699
- Who's there?
- Me. Mr. Walcott.

338
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,703
Good evening, Mr. Walcott.

339
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,722
- My God, look at that.
- A million dollars.

340
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,777
Hyah! Hyah!

341
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,799
Untie him.

342
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,804
Throw him out.

343
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,831
- Let me get through here.
- Get back.

344
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,856
He was with me for ten years.

345
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,860
A loyal man, a good worker.

346
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,775
And a friend.

347
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:31,793
Hey boss, they killed the other guard
and blew up the safe.

348
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:34,787
- They didn't leave a penny.
- They caught one of the bank robbers!

349
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,790
Hey, they caught one of them!

350
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,883
Hey, they got one!

351
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,892
Hang him!

352
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,885
All right, out of the way.
Let them through.

353
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,821
I recognize this one.
Yesterday he was in my office.

354
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:08,821
I'm sure that he robbed the bank, he and his men.

355
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:14,614
Calm down! Take it easy! Now this man has
a right to have a regular trial.

356
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,910
Killers and thieves don't have any rights.

357
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,828
- Calm down!

358
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,837
Don't you worry. He'll be hanged. That's a promise.

359
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,919
But first he's gonna tell us
who his accomplices were.

360
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,838
Walcott, don't you wanna
get back what they stole?

361
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:33,847
Now listen to me!

362
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,849
Give me some time,
then tomorrow you'll see.

363
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,943
I think that the sheriff's idea is good.

364
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,860
I lost my temper for a moment.
Now I see he's right.

365
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:46,939
Don't worry, this man's going to be hanged.

366
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:53,949
Put him in the jail.
There's something funny going on. There's a rotten smell around here.

367
01:05:56,035 --> 01:06:00,535
- On your horses. Let's go.
- Sheriff... I'll go with you.

368
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:33,049
Whoa!

369
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,965
The prisoner escaped.
He must have had some help.

370
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:43,764
This is your fault sheriff. You were against us.
Dead men don't escape from jail.

371
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:47,979
Now this man has become a danger for us all.
You catch him, you hear.

372
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:50,983
I'm gonna make you pay if you fail.

373
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,066
Alright, let's go, men.

374
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:31,686
I think I'll go back to Lyndon City.
I'm anxious to meet Walcott face to face.

375
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,025
What'd you say, grandpa?

376
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:42,823
- I'd say you'd be making a mistake, as usual.
- Why?

377
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,703
Well, in the first place, Lyndon City's all excited right now.
They're mad at strangers.

378
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:52,134
You get recognized,
you're gonne get a rope around your neck.

379
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:56,132
And second place, Walcott isn't there any more.

380
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,046
What makes you think so?

381
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:04,055
I'm in the habit of using my head.
You ought to try it some time.

382
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:08,139
You know, Walcott had a pretty good plan.
Thanks to you, it failed.

383
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:12,148
Now, with me free, he's had to go

384
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:16,152
and give up playing
that honorable-citizen role.

385
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:21,736
- Which way you think he's headed?
- Same way as the gang and the loot.

386
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,162
Which is?

387
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,745
After criss-crossing their tracks
to add a little confusion and to gain a little time,

388
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:35,086
they went to El Viento.

389
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,880
That's a village in Mexican territory,
Walcott's favorite hang-out.

390
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:49,184
Now boy, you really know everything,
don't you, grandpa?

391
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:57,112
Except that now you'll stay here quietly.

392
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,202
You can go ahead and finish your shave.

393
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:07,203
This time I get there before you do.

394
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:19,214
Course, I'll leave you on foot,
just like you taught me.

395
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:24,799
Except I won't leave your horse
ten miles from here, so I suggest you look for another one.

396
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:32,227
Don't you wanna try some of this meat before you go?
It's just about ready.

397
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:38,233
I'll see you around, grandpa.

398
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,245
Bill!

399
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,181
I was thinking.

400
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:07,259
I'd like to have had a son like you.

401
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:12,177
'Cause someday I'm gonna
wind up with a bullet in the back.

402
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,267
Ah, forget it. Get out of here.

403
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,288
Might need that.

404
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,434
I'm thirsty.

405
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:26,462
Why did they run away when they saw me?

406
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,471
What are you afraid of?

407
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:40,476
You... you aren't with the others?

408
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,483
I'm on your side.

409
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:07,423
- Run away. Please.
- Why?

410
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:10,422
They'll kill you.

411
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:14,505
Before anybody kills me,
they got to get my ok.

412
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,514
And I don't think I'll give it to 'em.

413
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:03,137
Glad to see me, eh?
I came as fast as I could, little one.

414
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,558
Because I figured you were worried about me.

415
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:17,151
Kiss me, little one.
The whole time, I kept thinking about you.

416
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,577
"She's grown up, she's a woman now."

417
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:27,502
Was I right? Are you a woman now?

418
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,592
<i>You</i> dirty <i>little...</i>

419
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,597
You. Who are you?

420
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:47,603
Someone who takes his anger out on men.

421
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,609
What are you trying to say?
That I'm afraid?

422
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,616
You've got a stupid face, but you get it.

423
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:23,217
Come on, hero.
Let's you and me see which of us is afraid.

424
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:33,227
Something the matter?
Did you change your mind, hero?

425
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,648
Yeah. I've decided to kill you.

426
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,674
Unlatch your pistol.

427
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,678
The other hand.

428
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,686
Remember 15 years ago
at the Mesita Ranch,

429
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,610
another time you took it out on a woman?

430
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,689
Unfortunately for you, that woman happened to be my mother.

431
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:34,711
I want to deliver him alive to Pedro.

432
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:40,716
He ought to revenge his own brother.

433
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,773
Hey!

434
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:45,863
<i>Ok.</i>

435
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,830
All right, let's roll it.

436
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,837
Watch out.

437
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,420
You stay here. And whatever happens,
wait till you get relieved.

438
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:16,873
Where is Paco?

439
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,882
I asked you where my brother was!

440
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:33,949
Who did it? Who?

441
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,954
We have him, Pedro.

442
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,958
Alive.

443
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,975
You rotten murderer.

444
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,922
You rotten murderer!

445
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:30,710
You killed my brother!
You dirty rat, you're still alive!

446
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:37,013
Murderer!

447
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:42,596
- We must find out who he is.
- He's the one who shot Cavanaugh.

448
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,041
Well, that's interesting.

449
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,048
Then you're tied up with Ryan.

450
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:18,632
As his pal, you must know
where he happens to be now.

451
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,061
Men, prepare a deep hole outside.

452
01:24:27,145 --> 01:24:31,065
I'll make you talk, boy. Be sure of it.

453
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:39,653
Because we happen to be very interested
in where your pal is at present.

454
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:44,079
And my men want to surprise Ryan.

455
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:50,664
Talk. Do you want to finish your life
by dying of thirst?

456
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:55,005
Or chewed up by ants?
You've got a handsome face.

457
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:59,799
It would be a shame for it to end
like those mummies outside.

458
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:06,101
If l talk, who'll stand good for my life?

459
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:11,685
You tell me where we can put our hands on Mr. Ryan
and you won't die by either of these methods.

460
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:16,106
Pedro will kill you in a regular duel.

461
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:22,117
Do you agree?

462
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:28,043
All right, then.

463
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:30,042
Ryan sent me here thinking you wouldn't be back so soon.

464
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:34,834
He headed for Redstone Pass to meet friends
who'll help get rid of the lot of you.

465
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:39,129
And when is he supposed to
meet these men?

466
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,139
Today.

467
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:48,142
Redstone Pass is 20 miles from here.

468
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:54,069
We better be on our way.

469
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:57,148
For your sake, I hope
you told us the truth.

470
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:01,157
Bring him outside.

471
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,163
This is gonna be fun!

472
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:13,169
All right.

473
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:21,755
- All right, shovel it in.
- That's right. Go on.

474
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,181
That's better. Go on.

475
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,118
I see you're a man of your word.

476
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,127
We should be back in ten hours.

477
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:00,920
But you'll probably think it's longer,
out here in the sun.

478
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:06,221
The honor of serving the salt... is yours.

479
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,184
Let's get going.

480
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,273
Hyah!

481
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,287
- Let's see them.
- Here they are.

482
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:58,334
Hey, look. What's that?

483
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:06,340
Hombre, what are you doing here?

484
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:30,364
You better stop there.
The next one I shoot, I'll aim at your head.

485
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:00,385
You had to get here
ahead of me, didn't you?

486
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,402
Idiot.

487
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:21,995
Are you on your way in or out of that hole?

488
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:26,416
You remind me of a groundhog
that couldn't make up its mind.

489
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:30,416
Now, let's see.

490
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,436
I'll just leave you there for a while.

491
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:49,022
Hey... stop joking around,
will you, grandpa?

492
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,440
Here, don't give him too much.

493
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,520
Or too fast.

494
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:43,468
Give me that, please. Here. Please.

495
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:47,557
Senor, I don't know who you are,
you and your young friend,

496
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:53,146
but I feel you were sent by God to help us
and to protect us against the evil ones.

497
01:32:55,653 --> 01:33:00,153
Well, actually, I don't think I'm in that really close
relationship with our good Lord.

498
01:33:00,784 --> 01:33:04,504
And I don't recall
receiving any messages from him.

499
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:09,288
But I am here for personal reasons
and it may just those reasons coincide with yours, huh?

500
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:26,179
I think you've invented some tall tale
that sent Walcott and his men on a wild-goose chase.

501
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:31,516
- Yeah.
- How soon do you think they'll be back?

502
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:34,525
Eight or nine hours.

503
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:39,318
That gives us time
to prepare a nice, warm welcome.

504
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:44,323
All you men, listen to me.
You must dig a ditch from there to there.

505
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,623
I want it this wide and this deep.

506
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:51,536
Fill it with dried branches
and anything that'll burn.

507
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:54,625
Then stand by with your barrels of oil.

508
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:59,633
It must be done within a few hours. Now go!

509
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:28,241
- Is there a safe place for the the women folk and the young ones?
- Yes, outside the village at the old mission.

510
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:30,672
- Take them there.
- Vamos.

511
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:01,697
Pour that over there.

512
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:26,803
Go there.

513
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:36,732
I guess Ryan is at El Viento

514
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,645
and that he's had enough time
to prepare his reception for us by now.

515
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:46,445
- How do we fight him?
- Well, I'm taking four men and I'm attacking the rear.

516
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,660
You take the others through the front.

517
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:53,753
- Come on.
- To El Viento!

518
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,756
Here they come!

519
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:49,924
You should've knocked first.

520
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:13,949
They'll leave us alone.

521
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,034
For tonight.

522
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:28,882
The night is going to be long for them,
I think.

523
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,972
A little music might soothe them.

524
01:39:58,075 --> 01:39:59,905
It's an old Mexican custom.

525
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:03,923
They play you a funeral march
to wreck your nerves.

526
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:06,917
But don't listen to it. Go to sleep, son.

527
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:10,000
You gotta be well rested tomorrow.

528
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:14,150
That's good.

529
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:18,777
We'd better get to them now
before the wind comes up and hits us.

530
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:22,082
We've no time to lose, men.

531
01:41:48,185 --> 01:41:51,095
Ah, good morning. I hope.

532
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,167
You were there, too.

533
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:59,172
There weren't four, there were five of us that night.
I came in late.

534
01:43:05,262 --> 01:43:09,762
If it means anything to you, When I saw what was happening,
I was too late to stop it.

535
01:43:10,393 --> 01:43:14,893
All I could do was save a child
and now that child is gonna kill me.

536
01:43:15,398 --> 01:43:18,188
All right. I've been waiting for that.

537
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:22,106
But let me do something first. Let me help you now.

538
01:43:22,405 --> 01:43:26,905
There's too many of them out there
for just you alone.

539
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:29,200
When it's over...

540
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:34,208
I won't run away.

541
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:57,232
Manuel.

542
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:03,319
Pedro.

543
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:10,295
Out the back!

544
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:22,495
Before you fire again,
remember the Mesita Ranch.

545
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:20,665
How many bullets you got?

546
01:51:24,761 --> 01:51:26,681
Three.

547
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:31,604
This time I'm out.

548
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:35,694
I can see that.
You don't even have your razor.

549
01:52:09,806 --> 01:52:11,716
Turn around, Ryan.

550
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:19,734
Defend yourself!

551
01:52:25,822 --> 01:52:27,742
Turn around, Ryan!

552
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,750
- Turn around, Ryan!

553
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,836
Thanks for leaving me my horse.

554
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:34,869
Good luck, son.
