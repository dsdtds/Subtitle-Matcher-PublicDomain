00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:15,125
LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY

2
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,417
Brooklyn, New York...
in the 1880's.

3
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,542
I never saw a man meet death
with finer courage.

4
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,375
Don't let her stay in there too long.

5
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,542
Dearest, is Father...

6
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,042
is Father well now?

7
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:46,250
Yes, dear, he's well, he's quite well,

8
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,458
but we have no one left
now but each other.

9
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,750
No one at all.

10
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,083
My baby!

11
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:10,250
<i>Ceddie was not old enough to 
<i>know of anything else to do,</i>

12
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,583
<i>so he did what he could</i>

13
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:17,917
<i>and was more of a comfort to 
<i>her than he understood.</i>

14
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,875
Strawberries! Fresh strawberries!

15
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,708
Strawberries!

16
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,875
Fresh strawberries!

17
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,917
He'll be pleased, won't he?

18
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,500
Ach, the darlin'! To think of him
getting the like of that for his birthday.

19
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:43,167
Sure he'll be the happiest boy in all
Brooklyn till he falls off of it!

20
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,375
Dearest!

21
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,792
Dearest!
- All right, Ceddie.

22
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,667
Oh, Dearest... Look! Look!

23
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,792
Mary's brother, Michael, has made
it for me and Mary's given me this book.

24
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,667
It's "The Adventures of Robin Hood
and His Merry Men".

25
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,708
Listen,

26
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:09,125
<i>Back varlets! Touch Maid Marian at your
<i>peril. However many you be, I defy you all!</i>

27
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,583
See, Dearest, you're Maid Marian,
and I'm Robin Hood.

28
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:17,750
They crowd around you. I'll never leave
your side however many there are!

29
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,958
Oh! - Now, Dearest, you cry out:
"Help me, Robin Hood!"

30
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,667
Help me, Robin Hood! Help! Help!

31
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,625
Down with you, varlets! Now I'm...
- Oh!

32
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:26,875
There!

33
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,083
Do you like it?

34
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,333
Oh my!

35
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:43,375
Of all events in my life
this is the most magnificent!

36
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:49,792
Do you really like it, darling? It's what
you wanted? - It's exactly what I wanted!

37
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:54,750
I do hope it is! Only you will be careful,
won't you and not let it run away with you?

38
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,333
I suppose I'm about the safest bicycle
rider in the whole Brooklyn!

39
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,042
Ha-ha - d'ya mind that now!

40
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,208
Can I ride it now, Dearest? 
Can I go now? - Go!

41
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,917
I can't wait one minute.
Mr. Hobbs has to see it and Dick.

42
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,500
Can I go now, Dearest, at once?
- Yes, dear, only do be careful.

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,542
All right, there we are!

44
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,750
Bring it down slow.

45
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,417
Ceddie! Ceddie!

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,250
Do be careful of the streetcars
if you get out the sidewalk.

47
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,792
Oh, I will! - Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

48
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,042
Good-bye, Dearest!

49
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,208
Good-bye!

50
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,725
Ah-ha! Be careful.

51
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,125
I'll be careful, I'll be careful,
I'll be careful.

52
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,750
I'll be careful.

53
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,500
Good morning, Mrs. McGillycuddy.
- Good morning, Ceddie, a very good morning.

54
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,458
How are your bones
today, Mrs. McGillycuddy?

55
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,292
Oh, none too good after
the rainstorm yesterday.

56
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:51,583
Oh, they ached last night somethin' cruel.

57
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,250
Ties me up in knots the rain does.
- Does it? How very peculiar.

58
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,292
But, ah, it's a fine day to go bicycle riding.

59
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh, I suppose so, for them that
has bicycles and can ride them.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,375
I suppose everybody who has a new bicycle
will take it out and ride it today.

61
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:14,042
Glory be the goodness! And whose
bicycle might that be? - It's mine!

62
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,333
It's my birthday present from Dearest.
- Oh, it's a daisy, shure.

63
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:22,375
Fine enough for the president to ride.
- And it has all the latest improvements.

64
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,208
Oh! Sorta sounds like
the bells of St. Patrick!

65
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,625
Shure it's the luckiest
boy in the world ya are.

66
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,375
Well I'll have to be going.

67
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,750
I nearly forgot. Please choose my
apple now, Mrs. McGillicuddy.

68
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,000
But would you mind keeping it for me
until I get back? -Sure.

69
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:18,000
<i>Oh, there he goes oh, there he goes
<i>All dressed up in his purty clothes</i>

70
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:22,250
<i>The way ain' near away'n it be
<i>That's as tough as it's going to be</i>

71
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,458
Hey, where'd ya get de ice wagon?
- I'd like to get by, please.

72
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,625
Give us a little ride, will ya, bub?
- I'm sorry, no.

73
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,500
Aw, scared I'd get it dirty?
- No, but I'd rather ride it myself.

74
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,708
[indistinct protesting]

75
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,917
Hey, English, when did ya get back from
dear old London? - I'm not English.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,875
I'm American.
- Then where'd ya get that kinda gab?

77
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:47,333
My Father was English.
- Oh, does yer mudder know you're out?

78
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,083
Don't you dare talk about my mother!
- Mama's pet!

79
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,500
Mama's pet! Mama's pet! Ha, ha, ha.

80
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,917
I think you'd better take your hand off
that wheel. - Want to make anything out of it?

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,625
I want to make you get out of the way.

82
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,583
Ooh, ha... ha.

83
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,833
You don't dast, you sissy cat.?- Sissy cat! Sissy cat!

84
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,458
Ha, ha... ha.

85
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,708
Wait a minute, Ceddie!
Don't let them bluff you! I'll be right there.

86
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:14,750
Ha, ha... ha.

87
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,500
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!

88
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,583
Let go!

89
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,000
Go on, Dick! Strike him on the snoot!

90
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,625
Booo!

91
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,875
Hit him with the right!
Poke him in the kisser!

92
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,625
Heh, cheese it - a cop!

93
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,667
Here, ye young devils!
Git outta here! Git out! Git out!

94
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,917
Aw, why couldn't that copper
leave us alone? - We had 'em licked!

95
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,792
Thanks terribly for coming
to my rescue, Dick.

96
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,417
That makes us even for me 
givin' ya de mumps, hunh?

97
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,375
They didn't even scratch it.

98
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,125
Gee whillikers! Where'd you swipe that?

99
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,917
Dearest gave it to me. Isn't it
magnificent? - It's a lalapalooza!

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,125
I want you to be the very first
person to ride on it. - Aw, t'anks.

101
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,625
Ahem!

102
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,708
Aw!

103
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:51,833
Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr.
O'Brien. - It's a pleasure, Ceddie, me lad.

104
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,292
Course, I think we might have won anyway.

105
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:59,167
Sure, and don't I know it! But I had 
to keep ya from committin' murder.

106
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,500
I tell you what, Dick. I'll just go once
around the block and then you can ride it

107
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,583
to Mr. Hobbs store.

108
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,500
Make it later, 'cause I gotta see
me brudder Ben off. He's goin' out West.

109
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,375
Oh, is he? Where? Texas?
- No, Chicago.

110
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,875
Oh, that would be splendid!
Riding mustangs and shooting bears!

111
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,750
Dere's me brudder Ben now.

112
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,125
Come on, Dick. I've got to leave.

113
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,375
Well, come on down to Mr. Hobbs' store
as quickly as you can.

114
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,458
HOBBS' FANCY VEGETABLES & GROCERIES

115
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:41,250
What do you say to a little birthday party?
Ginger pop and cookies, and some candy?

116
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,417
That would be perfect Mr. Hobbs! Only...
- Only?

117
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:51,708
Well, oh, Dick's coming very soon and
I was thinking, oh, if we could wait.

118
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,792
I guess there'll be enough to go around.

119
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,958
There's a lump coming, 
I think, quite a big one!

120
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,750
What are you reading, Mr. Hobbs?

121
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:06,917
Ah! That's the way they go on now.
British aristocracy!

122
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,042
I've got no use for 'em - earls and
marquises goin' around as if they was

123
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,875
lords of creation, wearin' their coronets.

124
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,542
Did you ever know any marquises, Mr. Hobbs,
or earls? - No, I should say not.

125
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,708
I'd just like to catch one of 'em
inside here, that's all!

126
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,750
I'll have no graspin' tyrant sittin' 
around on my cracker barrels!

127
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:28,958
Perhaps they wouldn't be earls
if they knew any better.

128
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:33,375
Oh, wouldn't they though!
They just glory in it! It's in 'em.

129
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,167
They're a bad lot.

130
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,042
Here you are, Dick. Just in time
for Ceddie's birthday feast.

131
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,083
Jimminity... ginger pop and everything!

132
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,792
Here's to your health, Ceddie.
Many happy birthdays!

133
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,917
Thank you very much, Mr. Hobbs.

134
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,333
Why, Mary?

135
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,500
Come on home, darlin'.
The mistress is wanting ya.

136
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,375
Oh, glory be! Would you look at your face!

137
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,875
I'm very sorry, Mr. Hobbs, but I shan't be
able to stay for the feast.

138
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:05,417
Is anything wrong with the Dearest?
- Not at all. Sure, there's nothin' the matter.

139
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,208
What's happened, Mary?
- Now, don't be askin' me any questions.

140
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,458
But there's the queer, strange things
happenin' to us.

141
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,125
If you'll forgive me, Mrs. Errol, you must
not disregard the great position

142
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:21,667
to which your son has fallen heir through
the death of his uncle, your late husband's brother.

143
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:26,333
But what it amounts to, Mr. Havisham, is
that you want to take my boy away.

144
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,375
Mrs. Errol, you must remember
that I'm acting quite impersonally

145
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,458
and simply as the lawyer of the earl of Dorincourt.

146
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,833
The earl of Dorincourt disowned his son

147
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,417
and has refused to recognize
his grandson until now.

148
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,583
Why should I give up my boy?

149
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,667
I'm afraid I've been very stupid, 
Mrs. Errol. I should have told you.

150
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,417
My instructions are that you shall accompany
Lord Fauntleroy to England. - Oh!

151
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,125
However, I must remind you that Lord
Dorincourt is not very friendly towards you.

152
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:58,167
He's an old man and has always 
had very strong prejudices

153
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:02,625
against America and Americans and was
bitterly opposed to his son's marriage.

154
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,167
He's fixed in his determination
not to see you.

155
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,542
You will live at the lodge and a suitable
income will be provided for you.

156
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,875
The only stipulation is that you make no attempt

157
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:20,292
to visit your son in the castle,
nor even enter the Park Gates.

158
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:25,875
There's your sister, Mary.

159
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:29,208
Hello, Bridget. Why, what's the matter?

160
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:34,250
It's Michael! He's worse and we've no
money we can't pay the rent.

161
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:39,458
I don't know what... - Now, Bridget, I've
more important things to attend to!

162
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,208
I wonder what your husband's wishes
would have been in this matter?

163
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:52,542
You knew my husband?

164
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,708
Yes, I knew Captain Errol well
and liked him, as everybody did.

165
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,167
He was greatly attached to his old home.
- Yes, I know.

166
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,417
He, above everyone, would have appreciated
what this means to your son

167
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,417
the very great advantages he'll have.

168
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,625
Yes, you're right.

169
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,458
My husband would have wished it.

170
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,167
Mr. Havisham, I must ask you to let me
tell Ceddie about this in my own way

171
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:29,583
and in my very own time. He must never
know his grandfather dislikes me.

172
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,917
If he did, it would make it harder
for them to be friends.

173
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:37,125
Very well. Your son will thank you
for this when he is a man.

174
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,792
I hope his grandfather will love Ceddie.

175
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,208
He has a very affectionate nature
and he's always been loved.

176
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,750
This is Mr. Havisham, dear, whom your
grandfather sent to see us,

177
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,000
all the way from England.

178
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:04,542
How do you do, sir?
- So this is little Lord Fauntleroy.

179
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:21,042
You see, dear, your grandfather has no
more children now, and he's very lonely.

180
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:23,958
So he wants us to go
and live with him in England.

181
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:30,292
Because he's an earl and you're his heir,
you will have a new name - Lord Fauntleroy.

182
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,125
And someday you will be
the earl of Dorincourt.

183
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,292
Oh, Dearest, do I have to be an earl?
None of the boys are earls.

184
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,542
Can't I not be one? - I'm afraid it can't
be helped, dear.

185
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,333
Just think, dear,
soon we'll be starting for England.

186
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,292
Do we have to go to England, Dearest?
I'd much rather not.

187
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,708
Oh! What will Mr. Hobbs say?

188
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,042
Anything else ma'am?
- How much is your table butter?

189
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:08,083
13 cents a pound.
- 13! The last I bought was 12,5 cents.

190
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,625
Must've been last month. It's 13 today.
- Oh, indeed. Well, never mind the butter.

191
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,750
Heavens and earth, if the prices go any
higher, we'll all starve to death!

192
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,833
Good day!
- Good day, ma'am.

193
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,750
Hello, Ceddie. What's the matter?

194
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,667
Mr. Hobbs, do you remember what we were
talking about yesterday morning?

195
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,542
It seems to me we was 
talkin' about England.

196
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,292
Yes, yes and earls. Don't you remember?

197
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, yes, we did touch 'em up a little.
That's so.

198
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,917
You said you wouldn't have them sitting
around your cracker barrels.

199
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,917
So I did and I meant it too!
Just let them try it, that's all!

200
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:55,708
Mr. Hobbs, one is sitting on this barrel now.

201
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,458
What?
- Yes.

202
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,250
I'm one or I'm going to be.
I won't deceive you, Mr. Hobbs.

203
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,208
It's the heat!

204
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,333
It is a hot day.

205
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,542
How do ya feel? Got any pain?

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,292
Thank you, I'm all right.

207
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,625
I'm sorry to say it's true, Mr. Hobbs.

208
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:35,500
Mr. Havisham, he's a lawyer, came all the way
from England to tell us about it.

209
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,125
My grandfather sent him.

210
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,625
Who is your grandfather?

211
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,208
I couldn't very easily remember it,
so I wrote it down.

212
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,875
John Arthur Molyneux Errol,
earl of Dorincourt.

213
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,958
That's his name, and he lives in a castle
'er two or three castles, I think.

214
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,500
All his sons have died now. That's why I
shall be an earl. Now I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

215
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:06,375
Well, I'll be jiggered.
One of us has got a sunstroke.

216
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:12,625
Oh, no, we haven't. We'll have
to make the best of it, Mr. Hobbs.

217
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:19,542
What did you say your name was?
- Cedric Errol Lord Fauntleroy.

218
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,667
Well, I am jiggered.

219
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,250
Well... you always did talk
more English than American.

220
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,542
You think there's no getting out of it?

221
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,375
I'm afraid not, Mr. Hobbs.

222
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,500
Dearest says that Father
would wish me to do it

223
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,833
but if I have to be an earl,
I can try to be a good one.

224
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,167
I'm not going to be a tyrant, Mr. Hobbs

225
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,833
and if there's ever to be another war
with America, I shall try and stop it.

226
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,083
England's a long way off, isn't it?

227
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,042
It's across the Atlantic Ocean.

228
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:09,208
That's the worst of it. Perhaps 
I shan't see you for a long time.

229
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,958
I don't like to think about that, Mr. Hobbs.

230
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:17,583
Well... the best of friends must part.

231
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,167
I'm afraid, Mr. Havisham, our American
food must seem very strange for you.

232
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,625
A little, ma'am. I find that muffins are
biscuits, and biscuits are cookies

233
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,750
but the cooking's excellent.

234
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:46,125
And after all, it's the company that
makes the meal exquisite, not the food.

235
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,500
Thank you, Mr. Havisham.

236
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,917
When you're an earl, you'll give splendid
dinners in one of the most beautiful castles

237
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,667
in England.

238
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,125
Do you know, I'm not sure I know
exactly what an earl is?

239
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,958
If anybody's going to be one,
he ought to know, don't you?

240
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,000
Would you mind explaining it to me?

241
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:09,167
Well, someone is made an earl generally
because he's done some service

242
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,208
to his sovereign or some great deed.
- Oh, that's like the president!

243
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,917
Oh, is it? Is that why
your presidents are elected?

244
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:20,667
Yes, sir, When a man's very good and
knows a great deal, he's elected president.

245
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:25,750
And they have torchlight processions, and
bands, and everybody makes speeches.

246
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,750
I used to think I might like to be president
but never thought of being an earl.

247
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:33,333
No, being an earl is rather different
from being a president.

248
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,083
An earl is generally
of very ancient lineage.

249
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:38,792
Uh, what's that?

250
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,417
A very old family - extremely old.

251
00:20:42,917 --> 00:20:46,958
Oh, that's like the apple woman.
She's a hundred, I should think.

252
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,875
She's of such ancient lineage, it'd
surprise you how she can stand up.

253
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,750
You feel sorry for anyone who's so poor
and has such ancient lineage.

254
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:03,292
She says hers has gone into her bones
and rain makes it worse. - Ha, ha, ha.

255
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,833
When I said ancient lineage,
I didn't mean old age.

256
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:11,417
The first earl of Dorincourt was created
an earl hundreds of years ago.

257
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,625
Well, that was a long time ago,
wasn't it Dearest? - Yes, dear.

258
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:19,792
Many earls have been very brave men
and have fought in great battles.

259
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,042
I should like to do it myself.

260
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,542
My father was a soldier and a very brave
man as brave as George Washington.

261
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,500
I'm glad earls are brave.
That's a great 'vantage.

262
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,833
Would you excuse me a moment, please?
There's someone I must see. - Oh, certainly.

263
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:42,625
There's, um, there's another
advantage of being an earl.

264
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,750
Some of them have a great deal of money.

265
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,167
That's a good thing to have. I wish I had
a great deal of money. - Do you? Why?

266
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,500
There's so many things
a person can do with money.

267
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,500
If I were rich, I'd buy the apple 
woman a tent to put her stall in

268
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:04,042
and a stove. I'd give her a shawl, because
then her bones wouldn't feel so badly.

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,583
What else would you do
if you were rich?

270
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,125
I'd buy Dearest all sorts
of beautiful things. - Dearest?

271
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,958
I call Mother, "Dearest"
because Father did.

272
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,333
Then there's Dick.
- And who's Dick? - Dick's a bootblack.

273
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,875
I'd buy him some new cloths, some brushes
and a new sign - and start him out fair.

274
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:28,583
He says that's all he wants is to start
out fair. - Hmm. Is there anything else?

275
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:33,000
Well, I think Mr. Hobbs would
like a gold watch and chain.

276
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:37,042
But what would you get just 
for yourself, if you were rich?

277
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:42,333
Isn't there one particular thing
you've dreaming of having? - Yes.

278
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,417
A pony... but I suppose that would 
be too much to even dream about.

279
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,792
I'm so sorry.

280
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,375
A poor woman in trouble came to see me.

281
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,125
Oh, is it Bridget?
- Yes, dear.

282
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,625
I wish we could do something for her.

283
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,292
She has six children and her husband
is out of work.

284
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,250
He has inflammatory rheumatism and that's
the kind of rheumatism that's dreadful.

285
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,250
Before I left Dorincourt castle, the earl
said that if you expressed any wishes,

286
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:20,875
I was to gratify them and give you
anything you desired.

287
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,333
Now, here... here are five pounds -

288
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,708
in your money, 25 dollars.

289
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:32,167
If you have any desire to assist this
poor woman,

290
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,667
I am sure your grandfather would wish it.
- Can I have it now?

291
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,042
Can I give it to her this minute?

292
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:43,583
May I be excused, please, Dearest?
- Yes, Ceddie. - Bridget!

293
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,417
Bridget, wait a minute!
Here's some money!

294
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,833
My grandfather gave it to me!
It's for you!

295
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,792
That's a great deal of money, Mr.
Havisham. We've never had very much.

296
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,167
I'm just beginning to realize
the great power Ceddie will have.

297
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,917
Such a child still...
I'm a little afraid.

298
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,833
I think whom what I've seen of him
that you have nothing to fear.

299
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:11,083
Oh, I hope not. He mustn't be spoilt
by all these wonderful changes.

300
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:20,083
She cried!
She said she was crying for joy.

301
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:25,125
I newer saw anyone cry for joy before.

302
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:30,583
My grandfather must be a very good man.

303
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:38,167
It's more... more agreeable being an earl
than I thought it was going to be.

304
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,792
In fact I'm almost quite glad
I'm going to be one!

305
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:44,792
Heh.

306
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:49,958
MRS. CEDRIC ERROL COURT LODGE
ERLESBORO ENGLAND

307
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,750
We always liked that little house, didn't
we, Dearest? - We always will like it.

308
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,583
Yes, darling, yes.

309
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,042
I've come to say good-bye.
I have to go to England to be a lord.

310
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:39,875
I shouldn't like your bones in my mind
every time it rains. - Oh, ho!

311
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:45,000
Bless your dear little heart with all kindness
to me, me bones is as quiet as anything.

312
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,625
Can I give you a kiss for luck?
- Of course.

313
00:25:57,042 --> 00:26:00,917
Here's an apple to eat on the boat.
- Thank you very much.

314
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:04,542
Oh, no, darlin'... Why should you pay?

315
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,417
As me late husband used to say,
"This one's on the house."

316
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,625
Thank you again. Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye, darlin'.

317
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,667
Well...

318
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,625
Well...

319
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:50,417
Well...

320
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,208
Well...

321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,208
Well, good-bye.

322
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,208
I hope trade will be good.

323
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,708
Chee, if trade gets any better, I'll be
rollin' around in di'monds and poils!

324
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,042
That would be splendid, wouldn't it!

325
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,167
I hope you have every sort
of luck and happiness.

326
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,333
Thanks - same to you!
An' I hope you t'ink about us sometime

327
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:20,458
when you're way over dere,
as dey say, "on foreign surl".

328
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,833
I'll think about you all the time. I'll
write to you. And you must write to me.

329
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,458
Here's where you send your letter.

330
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,417
Chee, I...

331
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,583
I wish you wasn't goin' away.

332
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,000
T'anks, mister, for the t'ings
you're done for him.

333
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,250
He certainly deserves 'em.
He's a game little kid.

334
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:46,792
Chee, I almost forgot!

335
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,042
Here, I bought dis for ya.

336
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,125
It's a hankercheef. You can use it 
when you get among dem swells.

337
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,833
Oh, Dick! It's beautiful!

338
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:02,208
It's extraordinary!

339
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,292
I'll use it always.

340
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,833
Thank you, Dick.

341
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,167
Thank you very much.

342
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:14,500
Well... good-bye.

343
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,292
Well... good-bye.

344
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,458
Would you mind very much
not going in with me?

345
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:32,208
I think I'd better be alone.
- Certainly. I quite understand.

346
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,417
This is for you, Mr. Hobbs.

347
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,875
It'll look fine when you're smoking it.

348
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,208
Why, Ceddie...

349
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,917
That's just what I wanted for a long time.

350
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,417
This is my real present, Mr. Hobbs.

351
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,292
There's something written on it -
inside the case.

352
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:30,667
I told the man what to say. You read it.

353
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:43,792
<i>From his oldest friend,
<i>Lord Fauntleroy, to Mr. Hobbs.</i>

354
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:49,125
<i>When this you see, remember me.</i>

355
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:59,167
When this you see, remember me.

356
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,292
I don't want you to forget me.
- Oh, I won't forget you.

357
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,708
Don't you go and forget me when you go
over there amongst those British aristocracy.

358
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:15,333
I shouldn't forget you whoever I was
among. I hope you'll come to see me.

359
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,958
Perhaps my grandfather
will write and invite you.

360
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,333
You - you wouldn't mind him
being an earl, would you?

361
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:27,417
I mean, uh... you wouldn't stay away
just because he was one?

362
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,708
Oh, I'll come and see you.

363
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,750
I... I won't be able to help myself.

364
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:21,917
Cleared!

365
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,375
Cleared!

366
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:58,917
Is this Dorincourt Castle, Dearest?
- No. This is Court Lodge where your...

367
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,417
There's Mary! We had a splendid
time in London, Mary.

368
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:12,458
I'm so glad you came before us, Mary.
We don't feel so strange,

369
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,000
finding you here to welcome us.

370
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:18,000
Sure 'tis the great happiness I wish you
ma'am, in your lovely, new home.

371
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,833
This is Mrs. Baines, the cook, ma'am,
and that's Susan, the parlor maid.

372
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:31,708
I'm sure we'll do everything, ma'am,
to make ye comfortable.

373
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,042
Oh, I'm sure you will.

374
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,417
I must say good-bye. The carriage is
waiting to take me to the castle.

375
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:48,833
I must tell the earl of your safe arrival.
- He needn't go tonight?

376
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:53,542
I'd so like to have him with me
my first night here.

377
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:57,000
No, I'm sure Lord Dorincourt 
won't expect his grandson tonight.

378
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:58,792
Tomorrow will be time enough.

379
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:04,083
I dread so to tell him that we're not 
going to live together anymore.

380
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,542
I'm a coward, I know, 
putting it off so long, but

381
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:14,333
it's the most difficult, the most 
cruel thing I've ever had to do.

382
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,917
I wish you'd tell His Lordship that
I'd rather not have the money.

383
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,042
You mean the income he wishes
to settle on you?

384
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:31,083
I have little money of my own
quite enough to live simply on.

385
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,542
I must accept the house, because that makes
it possible for me to be near Ceddie.

386
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,750
I'm grateful to him for that, but...

387
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,167
He'll be very angry.
He won't understand it at all.

388
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,833
I think he will understand.

389
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,667
He must understand that I can't 
accept money from a man who...

390
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,333
hates me so much that he's separating me
from my boy. - I'll deliver your message.

391
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:14,458
I think it's beautiful here,
don't you Dearest?

392
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:23,500
Ceddie, darlin', there's something
I must tell you.

393
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,792
You're not going to understand it, I know,

394
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:31,458
but I want you to believe me as you
always have when I tell you it's for the best.

395
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:38,625
Tomorrow, Mr. Havisham will take you
to your grandfather

396
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:43,542
and you will live with him at the 
castle. I shall not go with you.

397
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:49,958
This pretty house will be my home, and
Mary will be here to look after me.

398
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:53,833
But Dearest you don't mean

399
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,500
you can't mean that

400
00:34:56,917 --> 00:35:00,125
we're not going to be together
just as we've always been?

401
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,542
Oh, no! I can't! I couldn't!

402
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,583
I won't! I won't!

403
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,542
Ceddie, you must be brave and sensible.

404
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:19,958
If there are some things you can't
understand now, you'll understand them later.

405
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:26,500
It’s best for you to live there. There...
there are good reasons why it tis.

406
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:33,833
You mean, you want me to go away from you?
- Of course not, darling.

407
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,542
But now you're growing older and we 
must trust and help one another,

408
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,375
without asking any questions.

409
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:47,458
And you know, Ceddie, your grandfather 
loves you and wants you to love him.

410
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:51,917
He's so kind he... he wants you to be 
happy and to make other people happy.

411
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:57,042
But Dearest, I can't be happy without you.

412
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,792
But you won't be without me all the time.

413
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:05,375
I'm not far from the castle here and 
you'll run in and see me every day.

414
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,667
You'll love the castle and there'll always
be something new and interesting to tell me.

415
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:15,542
And I'll have things to tell you! Oh,
Ceddie, we'll have such good times together!

416
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:21,500
We'll be finding things out,
both of us. We'll be explorers.

417
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:26,917
Yes. Like... like Mr. Stanley
and Mr. Livingston.

418
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,625
That'll be exciting.

419
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,583
And every night when it grows dark,
I'll put a candle in the window

420
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,167
to guide you through
the jungle, Mr. Stanley.

421
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:30,083
Ah, Newick. How's His Lordship?
- He's in the rare mood!

422
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,917
He told me to evict all the tenants
if they weren't paid up.

423
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,708
I dare say, that'll be a job
to your liking.

424
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:47,292
Oh, sir.
- Ah, Purvis, glad to see you again.

425
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,417
Very glad to see you, sir.

426
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:54,667
Fool! Idiot! Do what you're told,
bring what's ordered!

427
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,958
Gout?
- Oh, yes, sir.

428
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,792
These last few weeks have been 
the worst I've ever known, sir.

429
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:09,167
I'm surrounded by a lot of incompetent
nincompoops! Shut the door, you blockhead!

430
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,875
I can't stand 'im no longer, Mr. Purvis.

431
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:16,083
He's too much for any man - cursin',
swearin' and callin' people out

432
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,083
of other names like 'e does.
It ain't just today, it's every day!

433
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:23,167
Thomas, you brought him the '63 port.
He prefers the '51.

434
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,500
'Ow was I to know? He didn't say!
- Fetch the other bottle!

435
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,333
W'at business has 'e got drinking' 
Port anyway in 'is condition!

436
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,958
I can't feed and house every lout
in the parish and I won't!

437
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,042
You and your poor - I've had
enough of 'em! - But, my lord...

438
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,250
Mr. Mordaunt is with him.

439
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:46,583
I've said all I have to say, now, good
night! - Good day, my lord... good day.

440
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:47,583
I beg your pardon.

441
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:49,417
How'd you do, Mr. Havisham?

442
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:50,708
Yes, ah, Mr. Mordaunt.

443
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,000
Mr. Havisham, my lord.

444
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:08,042
Well, Havisham. - My lord.
- Come back, have you?

445
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,792
Put that cushion right for me, will you?

446
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,542
Aie! Aie! Careful!

447
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,667
That foot's full of hot needles!

448
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,625
Well, what have you got to tell me?

449
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:28,250
Lord Fauntleroy and his mother
are at Court Lodge.

450
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:31,167
They bore the voyage excellently,
and in good health.

451
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,833
Ah... what else? - His Lordship remains
with his mother tonight.

452
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,125
I'll bring him to the castle tomorrow.
- Well, go on! Tell me everything!

453
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:42,708
Never mind about the mother.
What sort of a lad is he, I say?

454
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:46,583
It's rather difficult to judge the
character of a child of nine.

455
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,958
A fool, huh? A clumsy cub?

456
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:53,167
I don't know much about the children, 
but I thought him rather a fine lad.

457
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,958
Healthy, well grown, eh?

458
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,958
Apparently healthy, quite well grown.
- Straight limbed? Well enough to look at?

459
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,417
Rather handsome, my lord - as boys go.
- Ah.

460
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,333
Although I'm... I'm scarcely a judge.

461
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,833
I dare say you will find him a little
different from most English children.

462
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:15,292
No doubt of that! American children are the most
impudent and the worst brought up in the world.

463
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:20,708
I've heard that often enough.
- I would hardly call it impudent.

464
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:24,875
The difference is, that he has lived more
with older people than with children

465
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:29,583
and I should call it a mixture
of maturity and childishness. - Exactly!

466
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,917
Beastly impudent bad manners -
that what it tis!

467
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,583
I have a message
to deliver from Mrs. Errol.

468
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:40,042
I want none of her messages!
The less I hear, the better!

469
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,042
Ah, but this is rather an important one.

470
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:46,500
She prefers not to accept the income
you propose to settle on her.

471
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,208
What's that? What d'you say?

472
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,375
She says it's not necessary that as the
relations between you are not...

473
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,667
not friendly...
- Not friendly!

474
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,667
I should say they were not friendly!

475
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,250
Mercenary, sharp-voiced American!

476
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,750
My lord, you could hardly call
her mercenary. She's asked for nothing!

477
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:11,833
Nah... all done for effect! She thinks
she can wheedle me into seeing her.

478
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:16,875
Thinks I shall admire her spirit but
I don't! Have the money sent to her.

479
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:21,458
She won't spend it. - I don't care whether she
spends it! She shall have it sent to her.

480
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:26,083
She shan't tell people she's to live as a
pauper because I'm doing nothing for her!

481
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,917
I suppose she's poisoning
the boy's mind against me too.

482
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:37,667
No, I have another message that will
prove she's not done that.

483
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,208
I won't hear... Ow! Oh! Ah!

484
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:48,708
She asks you not to let Lord Fauntleroy
hear anything that might lead him

485
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:53,458
to understand that you are separating him
from her because of your prejudice against her.

486
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,875
She says he wouldn't comprehend it.

487
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:59,250
That it might make him fear you in some
measure, or at least,

488
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:01,375
cause him to feel less affection for you.

489
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:05,083
She wants there to be no shadow
on your first meeting.

490
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:09,500
Come now, Havisham, come now!
You don't mean that mother hasn't told him?

491
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:14,042
Not a word, my lord. Nothing has been said
to the boy to give him the slightest doubt

492
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,125
of your perfection.

493
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:21,125
He's prepared to believe you the most
amiable and affectionate of grandparents.

494
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,958
In fact, he already regards you
as a wonder of generosity.

495
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,625
Uh!

496
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,083
He does, eh?

497
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:41,042
I would suggest, my lord,
that Fauntleroy's impressions of you

498
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,875
depend entirely upon yourself.

499
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,167
I make a further suggestion

500
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:50,000
you will succeed better with him if you
take care not to speak slightingly to him

501
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,417
of his mother.
- The boy's only nine.

502
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:56,500
Nevertheless, those nine years have 
been spent at his mother's side.

503
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:58,792
She has all his affection.

504
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:01,417
Hmm...

505
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,833
So he thinks me generous, eh!

506
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,417
Ah, Purvis, this is Lord Fauntleroy.

507
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,292
My lord. - How do you do?
- Thank you, my lord.

508
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,167
My lord.

509
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,417
This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon.

510
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:23,583
Lord Fauntleroy, this is Mrs. Mellon,
the housekeeper. - How do you do, ma'am?

511
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,500
I should know His Lordship anywhere, sir.
He has the Captain's face and way.

512
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:33,583
Oh, was it you who sent the cat?
I'm ever so obliged to you, ma'am.

513
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
How do you do?

514
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:40,458
It is a great day this, sir?

515
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,958
Where is His Lordship?
- In the library, sir.

516
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,708
Lord Fauntleroy is to be
sent to him alone.

517
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:07,750
Lord Fauntleroy, my lord.

518
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:25,333
Dougal! Come back here!

519
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,583
How do you do, sir?

520
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:55,583
Are you the earl? I'm your grandson that
Mr. Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

521
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,625
I hope you are quite well.

522
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,417
I'm very glad to see you.
- Hunh!

523
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:10,000
You're glad to see me, are ya?
- Yes, very.

524
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,792
I kept wondering what you would look 
like if you'd be like my father.

525
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:27,500
Oh, and am I? - Well, I don't think you
are, very. - You're disappointed, I suppose.

526
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,917
Oh, no! Of course you would enjoy the way
your grandfather looked,

527
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,083
even if he wasn't like your father.
You know how it is yourself,

528
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:40,583
about admiring your relations.
- Eh? I'm not sure that I do.

529
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:44,208
Any boy would love his grandfather,
especially one who's been

530
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:48,042
as kind to him as you've been.
- I've been kind to you, have I?

531
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:52,542
Yes. I'm ever so obliged to you about
Bridget, and the apple woman, and Dick.

532
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:56,958
Bridget? Dick? Apple woman?
- They were particular friends of mine.

533
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,833
The ones you gave me all that money for,

534
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,917
the money you told Mr. Havisham
to give me if I wanted it.

535
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,833
The money you were to spend as you liked, eh?
So, you spend it all on these people, did ya?

536
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,625
Bridget, Dick, and the apple woman?

537
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:15,667
Yes, and I gave Mr. Hobbs
a gold watch and chain, and a pipe.

538
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:22,833
I put some poetry in the watch.
It was: "When this you see, remember me."

539
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:30,167
I'm going to miss Mr. Hobbs very much.
- Who is Mr. Hobbs?

540
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:36,250
He was our grocer - fancy vegetables and
groceries, you know. He's my closest friend.

541
00:47:37,292 --> 00:47:39,583
Mr. Hobbs is a very clever man.

542
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:43,750
Do you know, he can recite the Declaration
of Independence right through.

543
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:46,958
Oh!
- What's the matter?

544
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:52,708
I just remembered you might not like to
hear about the Declaration of Independence.

545
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:55,917
I forgot you were an Englishman.
- Hunh! You forgot!

546
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,417
You were English too, didn't ye?
- Oh, no! I'm an American!

547
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:04,250
You are English! Your father was
an Englishman. - I was born in America.

548
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,917
You have to be an American
if you are born in America.

549
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,708
You don't... - I beg your 
pardon for contradicting you.

550
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:15,167
Mr. Hobbs says if there's ever to be another
war, that I should have to be an American.

551
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:19,500
I promised him if there were another
war, I should try to stop it.

552
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:21,292
You would, would you? Ha, ha.

553
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,333
Dinner is served, my lord.

554
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:28,417
Ugh!

555
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:31,250
Now, be careful, man... be careful!

556
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,208
Careful now, careful.

557
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:35,625
Ow!

558
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:41,375
Would you like me to help you?
You can lean on me.

559
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:44,875
Once Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato
barrel falling on it.

560
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:47,875
He used to lean on me.
- Do you think you could do it?

561
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,250
I think I could. I'm very strong.
I'm nine, you know.

562
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:56,542
Lean on your stick on one side and on me
on the other. - Well... you may try it.

563
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:04,000
Just lean on me. I'll walk very slowly.

564
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:09,792
Don't be afraid of leaning on me.
I'm all right.

565
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,208
If it isn't a very long way.

566
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:19,625
D'you see that old fellow in red velvet?
He was the tenth earl of Dorincourt.

567
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:27,792
King George I decorated him for services
during the war with Spain and Austria.

568
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:33,458
He was tremendously strong, could bend
a bar of iron between his hands.

569
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:38,708
You get your strength from him.
- How... how very int'resting.

570
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:46,083
Did you ever try putting your foot in hot
water and mustard? Mr. Hobbs used to.

571
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,500
Arnica is a good thing too, they tell me.

572
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:51,208
Ah, thank ye. I'll try it.

573
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:13,292
It's warm, isn't it? A person can't 
help getting warm in the summertime.

574
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:21,625
Great heavens! What's that? - It's a
present from Dick. Isn't it beautiful?

575
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,333
<i>When this I see, I...</i>

576
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,708
I shall always remember Dick.

577
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:35,125
Yes, I should think you would.
It would be difficult to forget him.

578
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:40,458
Dick's a professional bootblack.
You'd like him. He's so square.

579
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:46,583
Square? - Yes, he wouldn't cheat anyone
or hit a boy under his size.

580
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,292
Oh. Very praiseworthy.

581
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:53,917
Thank ye.

582
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:03,333
What's the matter?
Don't you like your soup? - Oh, yes.

583
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:08,708
I was just wondering.
- Wondering? Wondering what?

584
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,542
You don't wear your coronet
all the time, then?

585
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,167
No, no. It, er, it doesn't become me.

586
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:21,917
Mr. Hobbs said you wore it all the time.

587
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:28,292
After he thought it over, he said you must
take it off sometimes to put your hat on.

588
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,333
Yes, I, ah...

589
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,417
I take it off occasionally.

590
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:52,167
You must be very proud of your house.
I never saw anything so beautiful.

591
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,500
It's a very big house for just two people
to live in, isn't it?

592
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:57,958
Do you think it's too large?

593
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,167
I was only thinking that if two people
lived in it who were not good companions,

594
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,708
they might get a little lonely. - Do you
think I shall make a good companion?

595
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:12,958
Yes, I think you will. I think you should be
almost as interesting as Mr. Hobbs. - Oh.

596
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:19,458
Mr. Hobbs and I were very great friends.
He was the best friend I had expect...

597
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:31,667
Fauntleroy, what are you thinking of?
- I was thinking of Dearest.

598
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:36,333
Who is Dearest?
- She is my mother.

599
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:45,125
I... I think I'd better get up
and... and walk up and down.

600
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,125
He's a very nice dog. He's my friend.

601
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:02,292
He knows how I feel.

602
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,042
How do you feel?

603
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,292
Come here.

604
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:32,292
You see, I... I never was away
from my own house before.

605
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:37,583
It... it makes a person feel a strange
feeling when he has to stay all night

606
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:40,583
in another person's castle,
instead of his own house.

607
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:47,125
But... but Dearest is not very far away
from me. She told me to remember that.

608
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,500
And, after all, you know,
I'm nine, you know

609
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,708
and I can look at the picture she gave me.

610
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:00,583
Look! You press this spring
and it opens and there she is!

611
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,375
I suppose you think you're very fond of her?
- Yes, I do think so and it's true.

612
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:27,417
Mr. Hobbs and the others were my friends,
but Dearest is my close friends.

613
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,833
My father left her to me to take care of.

614
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:35,833
And when I'm a man, I'm going to 
work and earn money for her.

615
00:54:35,917 --> 00:54:37,875
Oh, and what do you think of doing?

616
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:42,167
Well, I did think of going 
into business with Mr. Hobbs

617
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,333
but I should like to be president.

618
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,333
We'll send you to
the House of Lords instead.

619
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:54,708
Well, if I couldn't be president and if
that's a good business, I shouldn't mind.

620
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,542
The grocery business is dull sometimes.

621
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,083
Yes, so is the House of Lords,
but it's the business

622
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:08,792
that every earl of Dorincourt goes into.
- I shall have to talk to Dearest about it.

623
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,500
Good night.

624
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:50,375
God keep you all the night.

625
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,083
Morning, Thomas.
- Good morning, sir.

626
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:59,917
Where's His Lordship?
- In his library, sir and such goings on

627
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,792
I've never heard in my life!
- Do you think, it'll be all right?

628
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:05,500
Yes sir, he's expecting you.
- Oh!

629
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
Ah-ha.

630
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,375
Oh... ha, ha.

631
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:23,875
Ah...

632
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,292
Morning, Mordaunt.
I've found a new employment, you see.

633
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,083
Any good at marbles, Mordaunt?

634
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:35,833
My muscles are a little stiff, my lord,
but... I'll see what I can do.

635
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:38,667
Hah, pity about that!
I'd forgotten about your age.

636
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:39,958
Ha, ha, ha.

637
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:42,833
Ouch! Oh!

638
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,500
This is the new Lord Fauntleroy.

639
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:48,875
Fauntleroy, this is Mr. Mordaunt,
rector of the parish.

640
00:56:49,167 --> 00:56:51,417
I'm very glad to make
your acquaintance, sir.

641
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,667
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy.

642
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,500
Well, what is it this morning, 
Mordaunt? Who's in trouble now?

643
00:56:57,833 --> 00:57:01,125
It's one of your tenants,
my lord. Higgins of Edge Farm.

644
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,667
Newick has told him that if he doesn't
pay the rent he must leave the place.

645
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:09,083
He's a bad tenant, always behind,
Newick tells me.

646
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:13,292
He's devoted to his wife and children,
and if the farm is taken from him,

647
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,958
they may literally starve.
- That's like Michael!

648
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:22,000
I forgot we had a philanthropist here.

649
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Come here.

650
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:30,292
What would you do in this case?

651
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,583
If I were very rich, I should let him stay
and give him things for his children.

652
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,792
Nonsense! You're Lord Fauntleroy. It's time
you learned to deal with these situations.

653
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:43,583
You can write, can't ya?
- Yes, but not very well.

654
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:46,333
Well, go over to the desk
and write Newick his orders.

655
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:55,750
Now, what must I say?
- You must say:

656
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:59,958
Higgins is not to be interfered
with for the present.

657
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:02,875
Oh!

658
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,333
And sign it, "Fauntleroy."

659
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:15,458
Do you think it will do?

660
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:21,542
<i>Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. higins is
<i>not to be inturfeared with for the present</i>

661
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,625
<i>and oblige. Yours rispecferly</i>

662
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:24,792
<i>"FAUNTLEROY."</i>

663
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yes.

664
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:30,292
Higgins will find it
entirely satisfactory.

665
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:35,167
Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that
way and I thought I’d better say "please."

666
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:38,917
Is that exactly the right
way to spell "interfered?"

667
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,125
Well, it's not exactly the way it's
spelled in the dictionary, but...

668
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:44,958
I was afraid of that.

669
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,833
Yes, Higgins won't
complain of the spelling.

670
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:52,375
I think you must be the best person in the
whole world, don't you, Mr. Mordaunt?

671
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,917
I shall write and tell Mr. Hobbs.

672
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,000
Oh, what'll you tell him?

673
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:01,417
I shall tell him I think you're the
kindest man I ever heard of,

674
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:05,083
and that you're always thinking of other
people and making them happy and...

675
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,375
and that I hope when I grow up
I shall be just like you!

676
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,167
Just like me, eh?

677
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:23,667
There you are, Mordaunt. Take that with
you. - I will indeed. This is good news!

678
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:26,583
Thank you, my lord. - Oh, don't
thank me, thank Fauntleroy.

679
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:31,167
Thank you.
- Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye.

680
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:43,250
May I go to see Dearest now?
I think she'll be waiting for me.

681
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:46,625
There's something for you to see
in the stables first. Ring the bell.

682
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,375
In the stables!

683
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:56,250
If you please, I'm very much obliged,
but I think I'd better see it tomorrow.

684
00:59:56,875 --> 01:00:01,833
She'll be expecting me all the time.
- Ah, very well. We'll order the carriage.

685
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:08,125
You don't care to see what's 
in the stables? - Oh, I do! I do!

686
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,458
Oh, it doesn't matter, it's only a pony.

687
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,542
A pony! Whose pony is it?
- Yours.

688
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:20,042
Mine!
- Yes.

689
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:24,792
Oh, I never thought I'd have 
a pony! I never thought that!

690
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,208
How glad Dearest will be.

691
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,250
You give me everything, don't you?

692
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,667
Wouldn't you like to see it?

693
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:39,292
Of course I want to see it! I want 
to see it so much I can hardly wait

694
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:43,958
but I'm afraid there isn't time.

695
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:51,583
You must see your mother this afternoon?
You can't put it off till tomorrow?

696
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:57,083
Why, she's been thinking about me all the
morning and I've been thinking about her.

697
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:58,583
Oh, you have, have you?

698
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,250
Very well, ring the bell.

699
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,833
Let me give you your stick. Lean on me
when you get out. - I'm not going to get out.

700
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:34,542
Not... not to see Dearest?
- Dearest will excuse me.

701
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:38,125
Tell her that even your new pony
would keep you away.

702
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,583
She'll be disappointed.

703
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:49,333
She'll want to see you very much.
- I am afraid not.

704
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:53,875
The carriage will call for you as we
come back. Drive on, Jeffries.

705
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,792
It's a shame, parted from his own mother.

706
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:26,792
Cook at Court Lodge was telling Sarah
she'd never worked for a sweeter lady

707
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:27,875
than Mrs. Errol.

708
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:31,542
The letter was written by the 
little gentleman his own self.

709
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:39,750
Signed with his name too, "Fauntleroy,"
as large as life. - The little precious!

710
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:43,125
Ay, that's the mother.
- A pretty young thing too.

711
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:47,208
Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning.

712
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,708
God bless you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

713
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,625
Good morning.
- Good morning.

714
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:01,208
It's His Lordship coming to services.
That's a new notion.

715
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,292
They say even 'is gout's improving.

716
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:14,583
An' look at the young lord.
- He's captain Cedric all over again.

717
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,125
He's the Captain's self to the life.

718
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:22,125
How glad the people are to see you.

719
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:25,417
Take off your hat, Fauntleroy.
They're bowing to you. - To me?

720
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:29,042
How do you do?

721
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:35,125
God bless, Your Lordship. Long life to ya.

722
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:36,792
Thank you.

723
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,042
Good morning, my lord.

724
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,667
<i>[organ plays "Crown Him With Many Crowns"]</i>

725
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:27,708
<i>Crown Him with many crowns</i>

726
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:32,458
<i>The Lamb upon His throne</i>

727
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:38,292
<i>Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns</i>

728
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,583
<i>All music but his own</i>

729
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,750
<i>Awake my soul, and sign</i>

730
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,792
<i>Of Him who died for thee</i>

731
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:58,292
<i>And Hail Him as thy matchless King</i>

732
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:03,042
<i>Through all eternity</i>

733
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,500
<i>Crown Him the Virgin's son</i>

734
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:14,333
<i>The God incarnate born</i>

735
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:19,875
<i>Whose arm those crimson trophies won...</i>

736
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,458
May I whisper?
- What is it? - Who are they?

737
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:33,875
Some of your ancestors who lived
a few hundred years ago. - Oh!

738
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:37,125
Perhaps I got my spelling from them.

739
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:42,458
<i>...Shepherd King of Israel's fold</i>

740
01:05:42,542 --> 01:05:46,542
<i>The Babe of Bethlehem</i>

741
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:55,292
Well, Higgins?
- Oh, is this Mr. Higgins?

742
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:59,917
Yes, I suppose he's come to look
at his new landlord. - Yes, my lord.

743
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:03,958
I understand His young Lordship
was kind enough to speak for me

744
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:06,083
and I thought I'd like to say
a word of thanks.

745
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,792
I've got a great deal
to thank Your Lordship for.

746
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:13,667
Oh, I only wrote the letter.
It's my grandfather who did it.

747
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:16,292
You know how good he always is to people.

748
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,333
Is Mrs. Higgins well now?
- Yes, Your Lordship.

749
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:24,083
The Missus is better since 
the trouble was took off her mind.

750
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:28,458
My grandfather was very sorry about 
your children having the scarlet fever.

751
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:33,250
You see, Higgins, you people
have all been mistaken about me.

752
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:38,167
Lord Fauntleroy understands me. If you
want a little reliable information

753
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:41,083
on the subject of my character, apply to him.

754
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,875
Get into the carriage, Fauntleroy.

755
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:13,667
You miss your mother very much?
- Yes, sir. I miss her all the time.

756
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:19,375
You don't miss her, do you?
- I don't know her.

757
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:23,375
I know and that's what makes me wonder.

758
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,833
She told me not to ask
any questions, and I won't.

759
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,792
Well, you see her almost every day,
don't ye? Isn't that enough?

760
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,958
We used to see each other all the time
and we could tell each other things

761
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,375
without waiting.

762
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,708
Well, don't you ever forget 
about her? - No, sir. Never.

763
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,250
I shouldn't forget about you, you know.

764
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:51,542
If I didn't live with you I should
think about you all the more.

765
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,500
Upon my word I believe you would!

766
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,542
<i>My Dear Mr. Hobbs.</i>

767
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:18,833
<i>I must tell you about
<i>my grandfather immediately.</i>

768
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:25,333
<i>It's all a mistake earls being 
<i>tyrants. He's not the tyrant.</i>

769
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:30,750
<i>He has the gout in his
<i>foot and is a great suffer.</i>

770
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:37,000
<i>He is such a good earl. He reminds
<i>me of you. He is a universal favorite.</i>

771
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,375
Well... Reminds me of you...

772
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:46,000
Think of that, now. He's known this
earl only a little while, and we...

773
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,083
We was lifetime acquaintances.

774
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:53,333
I don't know as I want him to be
reminded of me by this earl.

775
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:56,667
They been usin' influence of
him, I betcha. - You're right.

776
01:08:57,417 --> 01:08:59,667
They got twisty ways, those aristocrats!

777
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:03,000
They'd wheedle their little finger around
your heart as soon as look at you,

778
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:05,167
all for their own purposes, mind!

779
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:09,042
It's a pity they're makin'
an eril outta him. - Yeah...

780
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:14,875
He would have been a shinin' light in
grocery business, a shinin' light!

781
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,250
You know any particklars 'bout dat
stuff like castles and erils?

782
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:23,333
No, not much,
except they're haughty and mean.

783
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,917
Sure is a jim-dandy letter he wrote. Almost
as good as seein' him only it ain't o' course.

784
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:35,083
Aw, he was a plumb-daisy of a kid. I betcha
sometimes he wishes he was back here.

785
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,583
I do.
- You lonely?

786
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:42,042
Aw, not so bad.
- Where you livin' now?

787
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,292
Me an' two udder fellas, we got a room
in a lodgin' house.

788
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:48,167
The udder two get drunk and 
fightin' but it's cheap.

789
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:51,833
That's no sort of a place
for a lad like you to be livin'.

790
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:56,042
Now, look here, I gotta clean,
dry loft over my stable

791
01:09:56,250 --> 01:10:00,000
and there's an old bed you can have.
Why don't you come here and stay?

792
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,708
It won't cost you a cent.
- Chee! D'ya mean dat, Mr. Hobbs?

793
01:10:04,792 --> 01:10:07,125
Why, I certainly do.
- Ya...hoo!!

794
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:10,208
Chee, Mr. Hobbs! Talking about erils -
you ain't no eril - you're a prince!

795
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:13,125
Aw, phsaw!

796
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,792
I wonder whether he will
have an American accent.

797
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:32,292
My dear, won't it be interesting if he
has the Dorincourt eyebrows? - Ha, ha, ha!

798
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:37,167
When do we see the mother? - I believe she's
supposed to be kept in the background.

799
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:46,542
Well, Molyneux, is this the boy?
- Yes, Constantia, this is the boy.

800
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:49,542
Fauntleroy, this is your great-aunt,
Lady Lorridale.

801
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:53,917
How do you do. Great-Aunt? - How d'ye
do young man? You're like your father.

802
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,417
I loved him more than most
people in this wicked world.

803
01:10:57,542 --> 01:11:01,042
Did you know my father?
- Know him? Of course I did.

804
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,500
Oh, then you must meet Dearest! She will
enormously like to talk to you about him.

805
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:10,250
You see, I was the only one she could
talk about him to, who knew him.

806
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:12,333
I was so small when he...

807
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:15,792
Yes, Fauntleroy, this is your
great-uncle, Sir Harry Lorridale.

808
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:18,542
How do you do, sir?
- Hear, you're fond of horses.

809
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:23,042
I'll confess to you, Constantia, that
what you will probably see for yourself

810
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:27,667
there's a risk of my becoming rather
an old fool about him. - Becoming?!

811
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:32,625
Ha, ha, ha! - By the way the mother,
what does she think of you?

812
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,708
I don't know. I haven't asked her.

813
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:38,167
You must come over to
Lorridale Park to see us.

814
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:42,333
There are some new cocker puppies in the
kennel. You shall have your pick.

815
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:47,042
Oh, thank you very much, indeed, uncle,
only, Dougal might be offended.

816
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:51,958
He's very fond of me and I really shouldn't
like to hurt his feelings. - Ha, ha, ha.

817
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,750
Hurt his feelings! That's a good one!
Did you hear that, Con?

818
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,250
Hurt his feelings! Ha, ha, ha!

819
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:03,917
This is Miss Herbert, Fauntleroy.
I want you to be great friends with her.

820
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,583
How do you do? Have you met Dougal?
He shakes hands beautifully.

821
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,625
Shake hands with Miss Herbert, Dougal.

822
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:17,708
He's a great friend of mine. I like 
making friends, don't you? - Yes, I do.

823
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:22,125
May I be your friend? And Dougal's?
- Oh, yes, if you please!

824
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:27,583
How's your lumbago, Fortescue?
Better, I hope? - Thanks. Much better.

825
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:33,042
I've known Dorincourt as well as anyone
could know him for five and thirty years,

826
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:37,458
and that's the first time he's ever
bothered to inquire about my health!

827
01:12:38,042 --> 01:12:39,667
Most extraordinary!

828
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,375
Well, Havisham, you're late.
What's kept you?

829
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:47,542
I beg your pardon, my lord. I was 
detained by extraordinary news.

830
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:52,292
News? What... what news? - Not now,
if you don't mind. Later, my lord, later.

831
01:13:03,208 --> 01:13:06,750
<i>The young May moon is beaming, love</i>

832
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:10,875
<i>The glowworm's lamp is gleaming, love</i>

833
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:15,583
<i>How sweet to rove through Morna's Grove</i>

834
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:20,250
<i>While the drowsy world is dreaming, love</i>

835
01:13:21,042 --> 01:13:24,333
<i>Then awake! Till rise of sun, my dear</i>

836
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,250
<i>The Sage's glass we'll shun my dear</i>

837
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:33,167
<i>Or in watching the flight
<i>of bodies of light</i>

838
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:38,042
<i>He might happen to take
<i>thee for one, my dear</i>

839
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,042
Charming! Charming! What a sweet song!

840
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,500
Thank ye, my dear, thank you.

841
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,792
Do you like music?
- Yes. I like it when you sing it.

842
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:58,167
Tell me, Lord Fauntleroy, why you look at
me so? - I was thinking how beautiful you are.

843
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:02,875
Fauntleroy, make the most of your time. When you're
older, you'll not have the courage to say that!

844
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:06,542
Nobody could help saying it.
Don't you think, she's pretty too?

845
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:11,000
We're not allowed to say what we think.
- Lord Fauntleroy shall say what he thinks.

846
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:13,375
I am sure he thinks what he says.

847
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,500
I think you're prettier than anyone I ever
saw, expect Dearest.

848
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:21,917
I think she's the prettiest person
on the world. - I'm sure she is.

849
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,042
And I must tell her how kind you’ve been to me.

850
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:30,417
I never was at a party before, 
and I've enjoyed myself so much.

851
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:33,375
Oh, I beg your pardon.

852
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,625
Good night, little Lord 
Fauntleroy. Sleep well.

853
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,792
Good night. So glad you came.

854
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:06,667
Well, Havisham, 
what in the world's the matter?

855
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,125
Something serious must have happened
to make you behave like this. What is it?

856
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:14,792
It's bad news, the very 
worst of news, my lord.

857
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:18,167
I'm sorry to have to be the bearer of it.

858
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:23,125
Why do you look at the boy so? You 
hang over him like a bird of ill omen.

859
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:30,042
Has it anything to do with Fauntleroy?

860
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:34,375
My lord, I'll waste no words. My news 
has everything to do with him.

861
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:38,042
If we are to believe it, it's not Lord
Fauntleroy who lies asleep before us,

862
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,125
but only the son of Captain Errol.

863
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:44,708
The present Lord Fauntleroy is the son
of your boy Bevis, and at this moment

864
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:49,833
is in a lodging house in London.
- What do you mean? You're mad!

865
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,500
It's a lie!

866
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,292
An abominable lie!

867
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:02,333
If it's a lie, it's painfully like the truth.

868
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:08,542
A woman came to my chambers this morning
and told me that she married your son Bevis

869
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:12,042
in London 11 years ago.
She showed me the marriage certificate.

870
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:16,250
The child was born shortly after Bevis
deserted her and was taken by her to America.

871
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:20,208
The woman's obviously an imposter!
It's a trumped-up fraud!

872
01:16:20,417 --> 01:16:23,333
I'm afraid not, my lord.
I saw the boy's birth certificate.

873
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:27,583
She is, I'm afraid, a very ignorant person

874
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,833
but she has consulted a lawyer who advises
her, that her son is, of course,

875
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:32,875
Lord Fauntleroy and the rightful heir.

876
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:35,417
She demands that his claim
be immediately acknowledged.

877
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,667
I'll protest this to the last!
I'll disown Bevis' boy!

878
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:43,875
I'll have nothing to do with him or his
mother! - You can't disown him, my lord.

879
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:48,125
Nothing we can do can keep the eldest
son's child from his inheritance.

880
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
The woman, you say is an 
ignorant vulgar person, eh?

881
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:07,708
She can hardly spell her own name. She is
obviously uneducated and openly mercenary.

882
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:14,958
And I... I objected to his mother.

883
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:19,917
I suppose it's retribution.

884
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:25,750
If anyone have ever told me that I could
be fond of a child,

885
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,667
I wouldn't have believed them.

886
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:34,667
I always detested children -
my own more than most.

887
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:43,000
But I'm fond of him, and oddly 
enough - he's fond of me.

888
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:48,875
You know, Havisham, I'm not 
popular. I never was

889
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,083
but he is fond of me.

890
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:58,750
He never was afraid of me,
always trusted me.

891
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:08,750
Yes, Havisham, he'd have filled my 
place better than I've filled it.

892
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:13,458
He'd have been an honor to the name.

893
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,250
You rang, my lord?

894
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:21,542
Take...

895
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,500
take Lord Fauntleroy

896
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:26,667
to his room.

897
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,583
What a pity! The boy's
thoroughbred if ever there was one.

898
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:50,792
I suppose you may say it's a
judgment of Molyneux.

899
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:52,625
That boy...

900
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,417
the first human being he ever loved!

901
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,042
Will Molyneux take the case
to the courts d'you think?

902
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,083
Can't tell. He's obstinate enough.

903
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,833
You go in with your best suit,
buckles on your shoes

904
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:06,875
and you come out as nature made you

905
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:11,667
Bless my soul, Constantia, whoever would
have dreamed that I'd felt sorry

906
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:12,583
for the old boy!

907
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:15,750
I wouldn't have minded our having
a boy like that, Harry.

908
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:19,083
Yes, bit of luck for us,
old girl, if we had. - Yeah.

909
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:25,333
I'll tell you one thing - if his
Little Lordship loses his title,

910
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:27,417
the village loses the best friend it has.

911
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,458
That's right. An' I'll tell you another thing -
it'll drive the earl mad if this goes wrong for him.

912
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,708
He's been so proud of the boy,
you hardly believe it

913
01:19:35,792 --> 01:19:39,667
if you knew him for what he was before.
- And the new one's no lady, that's sure.

914
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,958
Bold-faced thing, that's what she is.

915
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:44,792
The dark-eyed brazen-faced wench!

916
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:47,875
'Ere's the earl comin' now
with Mr. Havisham.

917
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:57,417
You've somebody here calling herself
Lady Fauntleroy? I want to see her.

918
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,875
Come the ways, my lord. This way, my lord.

919
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:05,958
Come in.

920
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,542
T' earl of Dorincourt!

921
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,250
Pleased to meetcha, I'm sure, my lord.

922
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,250
Bevis!

923
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,667
Go shake hands with your grandpa.

924
01:20:57,417 --> 01:20:59,625
So that's the way you're 
gonna treat your grandson?

925
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,542
You needn't try to look so fierce about
it - he's your grandson all right!

926
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:07,250
Ah, yes, me lord, we have proof
of young gentleman's birth.

927
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,292
He is the son of the late Lord Fauntleroy.

928
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:14,542
Allow me to introduce myself.
Joshua Snade at your service. My card.

929
01:21:16,917 --> 01:21:19,958
I've already had the pleasure of making
Mr. Havisham's acquaintance.

930
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:24,292
Lady Fauntleroy has placed
all the evidence in my hands.

931
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:29,125
I can assure you, lord, it is sufficient
to justify her case should it come into court.

932
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:33,208
But may I suggest that, uh,
we come to an arrangement

933
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:36,500
and settle this matter amicably
on a friendly basis...

934
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:38,083
Friendly? Huh!

935
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:41,958
Look at him starin' as though I was 
dirt! His own daughter-in-law!

936
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:46,125
Oh, your son Bevis married me, 
all right and a fine rotter he was!

937
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:49,208
But he was the father and I can 
prove it! - Lady Fauntleroy, please...

938
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:51,792
You may think you can fight me -
a lot of good it'll do!

939
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:54,292
They don't love you - you know it!

940
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:57,458
I've heard plenty about you
and your dirty, snobbish pride!

941
01:21:57,583 --> 01:21:59,708
Plenty of pride you'll have when
I'm finished with you!

942
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:04,458
Unless you want to get reasonable
with your own flesh and blood.

943
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,750
Lady Fauntleroy, I beg you...
- Shut up!

944
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:09,667
I'll stop at nothing! I drag this case
through every court.

945
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:13,833
I'll let the world know what you are -
you and your precious son Bevis!

946
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,500
Deserting me and his own
child - a babe in arms!

947
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,375
How I've suffered,
heaven only knows!

948
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:24,542
And you standin' and lookin' at me
and my boy as if we was scum!

949
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,333
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

950
01:22:27,083 --> 01:22:28,833
You say you married my eldest son.

951
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:32,083
If that's proved to be true,
the law's on your side.

952
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:38,625
In that case your son will be Lord
Fauntleroy. and you will be provided for.

953
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:42,750
But I warn you - the matter
will be sifted to the very bottom.

954
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:49,292
I'll only add that I want to see nothing
of you or your boy as long as I live.

955
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:54,625
After my death, you can, unfortunately,
do as you please.

956
01:22:57,583 --> 01:23:03,833
Yes, you're exactly the kind of person that I
should have expected my son Bevis to choose.

957
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:11,750
Ha, ha, ha!

958
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:17,375
I'm afraid, Dorincourt,
there can be no two opinions.

959
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,917
At least, that's how I see it.
You agree, Semple?

960
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,750
Yes, I'm afraid we can see it no
other way. - But it's... it's monstrous!

961
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:31,083
That woman... 
that boy are utterly unfit!

962
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:34,000
Alas, the law can take
no cognizance of such things.

963
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:38,417
I sympathize, Dorincourt, more than I can
say. - Sympathize! What's the use of that?

964
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,458
If we take it to the courts there can
be only one result? - I'm afraid so.

965
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,458
The birth certificate, everything
we have, point the same way.

966
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:49,667
If you take it to court, you'll have
the expense and notoriety,

967
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:52,417
and only, I fear, one possible result.

968
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:56,000
Perhaps the boy won't turn
out so badly as you fear.

969
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,000
Perhaps you can do something
with him. - That boy?

970
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:00,750
That... oaf!

971
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:10,875
With the other one - yes.

972
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:14,833
Well...

973
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:19,000
I have no other course but 
to accept your judgment.

974
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,500
Come, Havisham. - Thank you, my lord.
- And you, Mr. Semple.

975
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:36,000
It's the earl, ma'am. The earl himself!

976
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,250
Show him in.

977
01:24:58,292 --> 01:25:01,500
Mrs. Errol, I believe.
- Yes, I'm Mrs. Errol.

978
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,708
I'm Lord Dorincourt.

979
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:07,542
The boy is very like you.

980
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,917
People have often said so.

981
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:15,500
I'm glad to think he's like his
father too. - Yes, he is - like my son.

982
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:19,125
Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

983
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:31,292
I've come to tell you that I've had the
very best, the highest legal opinion.

984
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:37,167
But I'm sorry. This outrageous 
woman and her child...

985
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:41,125
Perhaps she cares for him as much as
I care for Ceddie, my lord.

986
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,958
Her son is Lord Fauntleroy - mine's not.

987
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:47,333
Yes, I'm afraid you're right.

988
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:52,292
Perhaps you would have preferred that
Ceddie should not be the earl of Dorincourt.

989
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:58,500
It's a very magnificent thing to be
the earl of Dorincourt, my lord. I know that.

990
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:02,750
But all I care about is that Ceddie
should be what his father was -

991
01:26:03,208 --> 01:26:06,583
brave, just and kind always.

992
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:11,417
Hmm, a striking contrast
to what his grandfather is, eh?

993
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:14,500
I haven't had the pleasure
of knowing his grandfather.

994
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,458
I know my little boy believes...

995
01:26:18,583 --> 01:26:20,208
I know that Ceddie loves you.

996
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,792
Would he, if you have told him why
I didn't receive you at the castle?

997
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:31,375
No, honestly, I think not. That's
why I didn't wish him to know.

998
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:38,083
Well... there are very few women
who wouldn't have told him.

999
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:45,875
Dearest, Ceddie is fond of me.

1000
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:49,458
And I am fond of him.

1001
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:53,375
I can't say

1002
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:57,042
that I was ever fond of anyone before.

1003
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:01,250
But he pleased me from the first.

1004
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:05,375
I'm an old man and
I was tired of my life.

1005
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,667
But he's given me something to live for.

1006
01:27:09,917 --> 01:27:14,958
More than that - more than
that, I am proud of him!

1007
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:19,167
I was satisfied to think that one day

1008
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:24,583
he'd be taking my place
as the head of the family.

1009
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:29,917
I'm miserable...

1010
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,500
miserable!

1011
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:46,958
Please, sit down. You've been so
much troubled, you must be tired

1012
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:48,958
and you need all your strength.

1013
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:51,583
Thank you.

1014
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:02,250
Perhaps it's because I'm
miserable, I've come to you.

1015
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:05,250
I used to hate you.

1016
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,208
I've been jealous to you.

1017
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:12,333
But this wretched disgraceful 
business has changed all that.

1018
01:28:13,167 --> 01:28:16,000
And after seeing this repulsive woman who...

1019
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,125
Well, I felt it would be
a relief to come to you.

1020
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:27,583
I'm an obstinate old fool, I suppose.

1021
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:34,292
I... I know I've treated you badly.

1022
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:39,292
But I've come to you
because the boy cares for you

1023
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:43,125
and because I care for him.

1024
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:49,958
Treat me as well as you can

1025
01:28:51,917 --> 01:28:52,917
for the boy's sake.

1026
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:07,708
Whatever happens,
he shall be provided for.

1027
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:12,000
Ceddie shall be taken care 
of now, and in the future.

1028
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:14,500
Always!
- Thank you.

1029
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:17,458
Do you like the house?

1030
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:20,042
Oh, very much.

1031
01:29:20,958 --> 01:29:22,167
It's a cheerful room.

1032
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:30,958
May I come back again and
talk this matter over?

1033
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:33,583
As often as you wish.

1034
01:29:55,833 --> 01:30:00,667
You've heard bad news, haven't you?
- Yes. The worst.

1035
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:06,333
Then I'm not Lord Fauntleroy
anymore, am I?

1036
01:30:08,125 --> 01:30:09,375
No, she's beaten me.

1037
01:30:11,542 --> 01:30:12,917
Then, the other boy...

1038
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:15,667
he will... have to be...

1039
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:19,583
your boy now, won't he? Like I was?
- No!

1040
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:23,792
But he'll have to live in the castle
if he's Lord Fauntleroy, won't he?

1041
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:26,917
That common little brat shall never 
enter this place in my lifetime!

1042
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:28,167
I'll take care of that!

1043
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:33,625
Then, I can still be your boy
even if I'm not going to be the earl

1044
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,042
just like I was before?

1045
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
My boy!

1046
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:42,208
Yes, you'll be my boy as long as I live.

1047
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:49,083
And, by Jove, sometimes I think you're
the only boy I've ever had!

1048
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:52,958
Then, I don't care about
the earl part at all.

1049
01:30:54,208 --> 01:31:00,667
I thought, you see, that the one that was
going to be the earl had to be your boy

1050
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:03,208
and that I couldn't be.

1051
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:07,083
They shall never take anything from you
that I can hold for you.

1052
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:12,250
Come what may, you shall have
all that I can give - all!

1053
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:17,000
And Dearest? Will the house
be taken away from her?

1054
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:19,917
No, they can take nothing from her -

1055
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:22,833
nothing from either of you!

1056
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,625
Come, it's time you were asleep.

1057
01:32:01,792 --> 01:32:05,458
Good night, Grandfather.
-. Good night, my boy.

1058

Yes! Here it says.

Well, I'm jiggered.

1065
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:44,958
At last they've succeeded in robbin'
him outta bein' a earl.

1066
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:48,417
I thought you was ag'inst erils?
- So I am!

1067
01:32:49,417 --> 01:32:53,583
Ain't it just like 'em - cheatin' 
the poor kid outta his rightful estates!

1068
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:56,125
Now, what's goin' to become of him?

1069
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:58,958
I know one thing. He done everyt'ing for
me - he can always come back

1070
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:00,833
an' have half of my shoe-shining business.

1071
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:02,833
Well now, I'll tell you, Dick,

1072
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:07,917
I'd always had it in my mind
that Ceddie would come in with me someday.

1073
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,958
He'd be a shining light
in the grocery business.

1074
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,083
<i>The new Lady Fauntleroy

1076
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,167
Here's a picture of her.

1077
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:34,125
Holy mackerel!
- What?

1078
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,208
Look at this! it's her!
- Her?

1079
01:33:36,292 --> 01:33:40,583
She ain't no 'ristocrat! I know her as
I know you! It's Minna, Ben's wife!

1080
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:43,500
Your brother's? - Sure!
- You mean it's some hocus-pocus?

1081
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:45,667
Sure I do.
- Well, I'm jiggered.

1082

She was married before - I never hoid of
her havin' no other kid but Ben's.

1083
01:33:49,667 --> 01:33:52,500
The one Ben went to look for?
- Sure.

1084
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:56,292
Maybe she had another kid in England.
- Maybe she did - maybe she didn't.

1085
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,917
We'd oughta do somethin' about it.
- You're dead right, we'd oughta!

1086
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,750
But we gotta get the proper advice.
- Chee, I wisht I knew Alderman Moiphy.

1087
01:34:04,208 --> 01:34:05,250
I know Alderman Moiphy.

1088
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,792
Ya do? - Yeah, come along,
let's go right now!

1089
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:13,042
Them earls! They've always had a spite
against us Americans ever since the revolution!

1090
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:22,458
What a place! What a hole!
I'm sick to death of it!

1091
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:27,458
Cooped up here week in and week out
with nobody to talk to!

1092
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:30,042
You're complimentary!
- I wasn't meaning to be! - I'm grateful.

1093
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:33,292
You're getting your money, aren't you?
- Business is business, you know.

1094
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:38,083
Business! I'm sick of business! I want
some fun! - Why don't you go to London?

1095
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:41,042
London? Not on your tintype!

1096
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:44,875
Nothing would please that old devil at
the castle better than to see me clear out.

1097
01:34:45,417 --> 01:34:48,917
Well, I'll stay here... here in this
rotten country pub if I...

1098
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,250
You've lived in worse places, I've no
doubt! - That's none of your business!

1099
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:57,542
You keep a civil tongue or I'll hand you
your walking papers! - I wouldn't.

1100
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:04,542
What do you mean? - Just what I said.
I wouldn't try anything like that, Minna.

1101
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:09,000
I'm Lady Fauntleroy, to you!
- Ha, ha.

1102
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:12,292
Come in!

1103
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,500
Why, it's Lord Dorincourt!

1104
01:35:18,292 --> 01:35:22,833
Why, this is a pleasure, a real 
pleasure, I'm sure. Won't you take a...

1105
01:35:24,917 --> 01:35:25,917
Hello, Minna.

1106
01:35:27,292 --> 01:35:28,500
Why, hello, Dick.

1107
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:40,750
Why, Ben. What are you doing here?

1108
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:42,917
Where have you been all this time?

1109
01:35:43,917 --> 01:35:48,958
You knew her? - Funny, if he didn't...
seein' how he was my second husband.

1110
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:53,000
Where is the child? - What child?
- You know, our boy, Tom.

1111
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:57,625
Oh, Ben, but you know...
You must have heard...

1112
01:35:58,083 --> 01:36:00,958
Someone must have told you.
- Told me what?

1113
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:07,500
It was pneumonia. Only three days
and he was gone. It broke my heart.

1114
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:10,458
I meant to write.
I didn't know where you were.

1115
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:13,708
If that's true, who is this 
boy you've got with you?

1116
01:36:13,792 --> 01:36:15,292
That's none of your business, Ben Tipton!

1117
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:21,500
Can I see him? - You can't! - Tell us why
Mr. Tipton should not see your boy?

1118
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:25,042
Oh, hello, Uncle Dick.

1119
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:27,917
Well, I'll be jiggered!

1120
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,125
Mom, honest, I'm sorry...
- Shut up!

1121
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:35,208
You're a dirty pair, comin' to spy on me!
Tryin' to do me hurt!

1122
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:38,708
I'll have the law on ya
for houndin' me, you... you... you...

1123
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:39,792
Silence!

1124
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:43,042
Come here, Tom.

1125
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:53,333
I knew nothing, my lord, I assure you!

1126
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:57,875
There's a little matter of a forged birth
certificate. - But I swear to you!

1127
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:00,958
Never mind, Havisham.
I've had enough of this - too much!

1128
01:37:01,208 --> 01:37:03,583
The sooner you are out
of this country, the better!

1129
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:07,875
Come on, Havisham. - You'll be sorry - you will!
It's prosecution, that's what it is - it's robbery!

1130
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:22,583
<i>The Earl of Dorincourt and Ceddie requests

<i> on the eleventh of May at 
<i>8 p.m. at Dorincourt Castle</i>

This will be somewhat in the manner
of a museum, my lord?

1134
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:46,292
Not exactly a museum, Mr. Hobbs.
They are portraits of my ancestors.

1135
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:50,167
Your aunt's sisters!["ancestors"] All of them?

1136
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:55,625
Well, I'll be jiggered! Your great-uncle,
he must have had a family!

1137
01:37:56,292 --> 01:37:57,500
Did he raise 'em all?

1138
01:37:57,583 --> 01:38:01,208
Ah, you mean that they were early
distinguished members of the family.

1139
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:06,750
Do you know, earl, I used to have a very
poor opinion of your aristocracy,

1140
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:12,667
but I've changed. Take you, for instance,
you're a good sort, even if you are an earl!

1141
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:13,833
I'm very gratified.

1142
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,875
A bit gay, wasn't he? - Yes, that's why
I have the gout, Mr. Hobbs.

1143
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,333
Oh!

1144
01:38:28,042 --> 01:38:33,583
And they was all earls! And Ceddie's
goin' to be one and own all this!

1145
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:37,333
And he'll be worthy of it, Mr. Hobbs.
- Sure he will.

1146

All these earls!

1147
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:45,542
Do you know, I wouldn't have
minded bein' one myself! - Hmm!

1148
01:38:47,625 --> 01:38:50,125
Speech! Speech! Speech!

1149
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:52,792
Speech! Speech!

1150
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:56,250
Thank you very much.

1151
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,833
It's such a lovely day. I always like having
birthdays, but never one so much as this,

1152
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:04,458
because you're all so kind to me.

1153
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:08,667
My grandfather wants everybody to be
happy and comfortable

1154
01:39:08,792 --> 01:39:10,917
and I'll want it too when I'm grown up.

1155
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:17,208
I think that's all, because I'm not very
good of making speeches.

1156
01:39:18,167 --> 01:39:22,292
But I must say that I'm very much obliged
to you for liking my birthday.

1157
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:29,208
Ripping little nipper!
- Ain't he a daisy?

1158
01:39:29,625 --> 01:39:31,625
I'll bet you boids elect him king some day!

1159
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:36,708
I didn't know the little feller
could talk so good.

1160
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,167
He makes a better speech than
Alderman Murphy - by Jove.

1161
01:39:40,417 --> 01:39:42,583
Ugh, well, I'll be jiggered!

1162
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:46,125
And I've another birthday present for you.

1163
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:50,708
Another one, besides all the things this
morning? - Yes, the best of them all.

1164
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:55,042
Oh, Dearest!

1165
01:39:55,875 --> 01:39:57,333
Oh, Dearest!

1166
01:40:01,792 --> 01:40:05,417
Oh, Dearest, I was wanting you here!
I was wanting you here so terribly much!

1167
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,500
Were you, darling?

1168
01:40:08,125 --> 01:40:10,958
Fauntleroy, your mother has
come to live in the castle.

1169
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:14,875
To live with us, to live with us for always?
- Are you sure you really want me?

1170
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:18,333
We always wanted you, but we 
weren't exactly aware of it.

1171
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:23,833
Well, Mr. Hobbs, it's so nice
having you here with us.

1172
01:40:24,125 --> 01:40:26,375
I dread to think of you
going back to America.

1173
01:40:26,792 --> 01:40:28,875
Not to live there!

1174
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:32,250
America's a good enough country for 
them that's young and stirrin',

1175
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:37,750
but there's faults in it! There's not an
aunt's sister among 'em, nor an earl!
