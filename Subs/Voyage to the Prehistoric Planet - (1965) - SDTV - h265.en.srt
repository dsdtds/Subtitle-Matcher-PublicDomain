1
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:32,459
The year, 2020. The moon has been
explored and colonized.

2
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:35,459
And the next space goal is about to be reached.

3
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:39,251
The first landing by man on the planet Venus.

4
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:46,126
Scientists profoundly hope that life, similar
to that on earth, may be found on this planet...

5
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:49,042
where so many physical conditions are like our own.

6
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:57,459
Three rocket ships of an international
space expedition — the Sirius, Vega and Capella...

7
00:01:57,876 --> 00:02:01,626
after having successfully traveled
two hundred millions miles...

8
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:04,459
are in the final stages of their journey...

9
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,917
rapidly approaching their destination.

10
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,751
What is it? What's happened?

11
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:30,000
Capella, sir. I'm afraid she's been hit by a meteorite.

12
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,042
Damaged?

13
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,626
Completely destroyed, sir.

14
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:34,835
Contact the Sirius at once.

15
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:35,959
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,875
And almost there. It seems so unfair.

17
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:58,835
There's no fair or unfair to
a meteorite. You get hit.

18
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,543
You die.

19
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,793
Seems so unreal.

20
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,209
I'd just spoken to them.

21
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,292
We joked.

22
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:16,126
It's Lunar 7, Commander!

23
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:17,459
Patch it in.

24
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:21,917
Attention, crews of Sirius and Vega!

25
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:25,376
We were deeply sorry to learn of the loss of the Capella.

26
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:29,126
Flight Path A, however, must still be followed.

27
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:35,626
Therefore, we request both ships to go into orbit
and remain there til the arrival of Spaceship Esther...

28
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:37,459
due to blast off here immediately.

29
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,126
Meanwhile, secure and relay instrument information
about conditions on Venus.

30
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:44,875
That is all.

31
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,875
That's swell.

32
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,042
Orbit and wait.

33
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,751
For how long?

34
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,584
- Huh?
- Why complain?

35
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,418
It's Hartman. He's the one who built this baby.

36
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,875
And know when he says we should go
fly all around Venus...

37
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,251
it's precisely what'll happen.

38
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:08,626
Better plan on it.

39
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,126
There's more I can do than orbit and wait.

40
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:13,668
What do you mean?

41
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:17,710
Look, the plan before was to land at one ship.

42
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,959
That's true, with the cybernetic machine.

43
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,834
You keep it! Why don't I pilot?

44
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:25,334
But, Andre, the machine will study the land.

45
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:29,751
This I know. But I'm more observant, more apt
to see what's going on.

46
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,917
You don't wanna send a monster.

47
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:35,834
Venus must be seen by more than a robot!

48
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,959
Alright. Just suppose we go
along with you, Andre.

49
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,585
What about Hartman's plan?

50
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:43,959
- Hartman would agree with me.
- But we can't take that chance.

51
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:45,834
Then, what do we do?

52
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:50,750
We contact Kern, and we ask him to have the
robot computer landing plan for the auxiliary spacecraft.

53
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,710
Assuming he'll be out for it.

54
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,334
Awaken, John.

55
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,668
Awaken.

56
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:08,251
Go, John. Monitor, John.

57
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,042
I hear you.

58
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:17,293
Preview us. Be extra precise.

59
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,876
There are changes you must make in our
present landing pattern program.

60
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,876
Plan now for Sirius and Vega.

61
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:29,792
You, me and Sherman.

62
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,001
On the same spaceship.

63
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:36,543
Commander Lockhart, Walters and Ferneau
on the second ship.

64
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,626
First ship, Sirius. Second ship, Vega.
Problem? Land on Venus and return.

65
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:47,876
Land three, and three. Sirius return five,
leaving one.

66
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,418
What man remains?

67
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:57,750
Then one of six must remain.
That one shall be me.

68
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:01,834
Lunar Station 7.

69
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:03,917
Lunar Station 7.

70
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,876
This is command ship Vega calling.
Command ship Vega.

71
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,126
Come in, Vega. We read you.

72
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,834
Professor Hartman, message from the Vega.

73
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,750
Alexandre Townman has computed a new flight plan.

74
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:24,585
We request approval for landing of Kern, Sherman,
and robot in the auxiliary spacecraft.

75
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,501
They will seek a safe area on Venus to land.

76
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,209
Command ship Sirius with Lockhart,
Walters and Ferneau.

77
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:37,168
I will keep the Vega in orbit, in order to ensure the
safe return of the Sirius with our men.

78
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,709
We feel it unnecessary to have to wait for the
arrival of the auxiliary.

79
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,543
This is Professor Hartman speaking.

80
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,084
Your plan is quite logical.

81
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,625
But I'm concerned about the possible psychological
danger to you in remaining too long on the Vega.

82
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:55,418
Get the psychological tests ready.

83
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,959
Well, I had expected to land with the others, but...

84
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:02,293
In view of the emergency situation, I feel this is a better plan.

85
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,293
Professor Hartman, I'm positive I can handle it.

86
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,667
So am I, doc.

87
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:08,959
Who's that?

88
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:12,543
Sherman, professor. Didn't anyone ever tell ya
ladies are tougher than men?

89
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:20,209
You're quite right, Sherman.
Perhaps I did forget.

90
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,001
Permission granted.

91
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:28,251
Thank you, Professor Hartman. I will contact
you again with a progress report at 0400 hours.

92
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,709
Commander Lockhart, Vega's calling.

93
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:52,834
Yes?

94
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:56,209
We've received permission to land, to be followed by the Sirius.

95
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,543
Well, now. And just how do you suggest
we manage that?

96
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,543
- Marsha will stay and keep Vega in orbit —
- It's her job.

97
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:06,376
But it sounds like it's all set.

98
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,876
Kern's robot calculated the details.

99
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:10,917
If you're sure, let's get moving on it.

100
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:15,959
Andre?

101
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,376
I'm ready, Skipper.

102
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,251
I'm with you also.

103
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,917
Sherman, make room for a spaceship.

104
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:35,251
I'll join you there.

105
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,126
Maybe.

106
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,418
Good luck.

107
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,792
See you on Venus.

108
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:55,460
Pressure reading on planet's surface...

109
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,251
Two and three.

110
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,418
No sign of opening.

111
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,792
Cloud formations, thirty percent ash content.

112
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,460
I see something.

113
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:10,584
A spot of red glowing with great brilliance.

114
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:11,792
Right through the spectrums.

115
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:13,376
Spot of red could be Hades.

116
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:20,043
We are now gathering all possible data
in preparation for landing.

117
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,751
However, no observation from orbit can let us know
the answer to the most important question...

118
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:28,251
we've come to ask of Venus.

119
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:34,001
Does life in any form exist on this planet?

120
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:38,293
And if so, what kind?

121
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:41,626
I personally doubt if any does, my dear Marsha.

122
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,667
A planet of fire below us.

123
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:49,667
This is a new world, or will it consume us all?

124
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:57,709
Suppose that vibrant spot could be a city or something?

125
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,459
Attention, Sirius. Attention, Sirius.

126
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:06,709
Sherman, Kern and Automaton John,
ready to embark at 0100 hours.

127
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,251
I envy you, Sherman.

128
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,500
And you Kern.

129
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:14,209
To be the first humans to set foot on Venus.

130
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:16,792
We wish you all a success.

131
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:22,709
I envy you both. Good luck.

132
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:24,335
Bon voyage.

133
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,918
It's about to hit the cloud layer.

134
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:34,959
She's moving well.

135
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,084
At any moment now.

136
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:53,210
Black clouds. Lightning.

137
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:55,417
I don't like the looks of this.

138
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,792
I'm turning control over to robot John.

139
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:06,001
Ahead steep mountain.
I am going up.

140
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,584
Wow, close call.

141
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,084
We're watching on the location-finder.

142
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:15,251
The area is strange. This is truly a prehistoric planet.

143
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,043
- Prehistoric planet is right!
- Hey, there's a hard, level spot.

144
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:20,084
Right.

145
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,375
Attention, Sirius. Your landing location
is square 73.

146
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:26,584
We're now dropping our beacons.

147
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,459
Landing three hundred meters
southwest of square 73.

148
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,168
Uh-oh, there's water beneath us.

149
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,542
We're drifting.

150
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,709
Commander Lockhart!

151
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,210
Commander Lockhart, what happened?

152
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,375
Marsha.

153
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,168
Don't be too worried.

154
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,501
The signal was only broken by the horizon.

155
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:56,834
I'm sure they've landed.

156
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,542
In an hour, when we pass in orbit,
we'll contact them again.

157
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:02,709
Yes, sir.

158
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,210
Is there anything further you'd like me to do?

159
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,459
Not for now.

160
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,584
We might as well all get some rest.

161
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,126
Sherman.

162
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,043
Kern.

163
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:31,334
Answer.

164
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,168
Kern!

165
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,001
Sherman!

166
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,085
Kern!

167
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:38,375
Are you there?

168
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:46,834
It's hopeless.

169
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,584
We've no choice.

170
00:12:58,876 --> 00:12:59,751
Let's break orbit.

171
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,667
We'll prepare the ship.

172
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,876
You'd better bring her about and plan the course to find it.

173
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:12,876
Marsha.

174
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,292
Marsha, are you listening?

175
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:20,126
Yes, Commander?

176
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,292
It's likely they're in trouble and need help.

177
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:25,501
The responsibility's ours.

178
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:27,918
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,667
Listen to me.

180
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,417
If something should happen...

181
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,334
Don't you be afraid.

182
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,250
I won't.

183
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,626
I promise.

184
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:45,918
Shall I sign off now?

185
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:47,918
You can help us most...

186
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,793
if you will be brave and keep faith.

187
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:52,626
I will.

188
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,250
Hello, Sirius!

189
00:13:56,584 --> 00:13:58,334
This is Professor Hartman speaking.

190
00:13:58,709 --> 00:13:59,584
Hello, Sirius!

191
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,501
This is Professor Hartman speaking.

192
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:07,168
We wish you to feel free to discontinue the
expedition at your own discretion.

193
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,501
Don't take unnecessary risks.

194
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,501
Your lives are too valuable.

195
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:15,834
All the nations of Europe are eagerly
awaiting the results of your exploration.

196
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,876
We wish you all success.

197
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:21,584
Switch.

198
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,167
Lunar 7.

199
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:24,751
My men.

200
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:26,250
The ship.

201
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,584
Are just about to break through en route.

202
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,334
The plan is to land approximately the plot area 73.

203
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,709
This should put us in position to contact Sherman
and Kern or to give them help if needed.

204
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,043
My people are proud and privileged to be...

205
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:46,126
chosen members of this expedition.

206
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,043
The first on Venus' surface.

207
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,668
Our special thanks to all people of Earth.

208
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,834
Well, my boy...

209
00:14:58,417 --> 00:14:59,584
All we can do now is wait.

210
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,459
What do you think they'll find, doctor?

211
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,626
Your guess is as good as mine.

212
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:09,167
Let's just hope that they arrive there safely.

213
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:41,459
We're landed.

214
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:43,834
Voila.

215
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,251
Don't begin celebrating yet.

216
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,043
Ooh.. Oh!

217
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:56,417
Is our level okay?

218
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,751
Yep, there it is.

219
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,125
On the button!

220
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,960
Boy, it sure feels strange to have weight!

221
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,292
Yes, it does seem strange.

222
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:09,668
That's sure.

223
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:11,292
But it's nice and solid.

224
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,417
Well, I don't know about you fellas...

225
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:14,751
But I'd like to see Venus.

226
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,043
Open number 3 and hit the beam.

227
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,334
Paper. Try the port viewer.

228
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,459
Telescreen gets it okay.

229
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,626
We'll pan port.

230
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,543
Formations of weird rock.

231
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,209
Something's there.

232
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,125
I'll switch on the outside sound pickup.

233
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,000
What is it?

234
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,000
- A human being?
- Hold it.

235
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:21,376
It's finished.

236
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,209
Transfer it to playback.

237
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,876
Meanwhile, you might check up on the atmosphere, Hans.

238
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:28,209
It better be good.

239
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,292
And you better get your spacesuit. We'll move out.

240
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:35,042
Andre, I want you to attempt a contact
with Sherman by radio.

241
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,376
If you raise them, tell them to report their position.

242
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:40,376
Then get yourself into a spacesuit and walk about.

243
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,292
- I'm right behind you.
- That'll be handy if I slip.

244
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:44,417
Get hopping now.

245
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:48,084
It's 4.7 on oxygen.

246
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:49,167
That's pretty close.

247
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,376
I thought we were lucky!

248
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,209
Good solid rock.

249
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:31,668
I'll check out there.

250
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,251
Keep on the rope. Don't get out of visual contact.

251
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,167
- I just received a message.
- What did they say?

252
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:33,917
- Marsha has radared Sherman.
- Sherman?

253
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:39,126
She can't be sure, but it looks like two objects, one
metallic and moving in the area we expected to search.

254
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:40,835
Probably Kern and Sherman.

255
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:42,042
Come on, Andre!

256
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,668
As soon as she knows for sure,
she'll contact us.

257
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:18,167
Andre!

258
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:26,668
It's got Andre!

259
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,376
Cut 'em free.

260
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:10,543
Nothing's broken?

261
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,959
Get a shot at that thing.

262
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:19,834
Careful, Andre.

263
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,501
Can ya imagine that?

264
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:27,959
He's bashful.

265
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,710
Why don't we take one o' those things home to the zoo?

266
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,334
You've got to be more careful, Andre.

267
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,668
- If we hadn't heard you call me —
- I didn't call.

268
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,167
You called out to us. We heard you.

269
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:40,792
But I didn't call you.

270
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:46,042
- It sounded like 'Lockhart'.
- Let's be getting back.

271
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,209
Call Marsha again, Andre.

272
00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:01,876
Made contact with crew of Sirius
again at 0825.

273
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:05,459
They reported a perfect landing on square 73 as planned.

274
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:08,042
Marsha, this is Commander Lockhart.

275
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:13,001
Yes, Commander.

276
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:17,459
I'm afraid you haven't given us enough information
about the location of the spacecraft.

277
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,126
I need to know their precise position.

278
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,418
I'm sorry. I was so happy you'd made
a safe landing, I forgot to tell you.

279
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:30,792
They're at square 107, about a mile from the red spot.

280
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,626
The direct distance from you is
thirty-two miles across the bay.

281
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,084
We'll have to go by air.

282
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:40,834
Is the car ready?

283
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,750
Lowered and ready.

284
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,917
- Will the car make it there?
- It does, or we walk.

285
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,626
I'd sure like a four-lane freeway.

286
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:54,626
Bet that you get a flag.

287
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:55,959
- Commander?
- Yes?

288
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,585
What's happened to the robot?

289
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:02,667
Marsha...

290
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:04,418
Marsha?

291
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:10,959
Have you been apprised at all about the robot?

292
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,168
Well, apparently they're having some difficulty with him.

293
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,876
He was loaded aboard the ship
partially disassembled.

294
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,126
I'm afraid they haven't been able to reassemble him yet.

295
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:31,792
Keep coming.

296
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,751
Come on, John.

297
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,418
Go and return!

298
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:42,751
Look out! Here's another one!

299
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:46,001
Behind you!

300
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,625
Look out!

301
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,834
Move John.

302
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:06,043
Adjusting...

303
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:11,792
There.

304
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:16,334
There's one hundred and ten.

305
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:18,625
Secure yourself to that boulder, John.

306
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,625
Proceed. Proceed!

307
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,792
He's as shocked to find this place as we are.

308
00:24:54,084 --> 00:24:56,168
I'm wondering if we should be here at all.

309
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,251
Why don't you catch a bus and go home?

310
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,834
Don't think I wouldn't if I could find one.

311
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,709
There he is.

312
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:04,667
He's off.

313
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:06,418
Pull aside, he can hold it.

314
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:10,834
You'd better go first.

315
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,335
I'll come along after you.

316
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,293
Stop the car about here.

317
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:45,751
See what I see?

318
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,168
Snoozing.

319
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:50,834
he may want us for lunch.

320
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,418
I'll try for a blood sample. I don't know.

321
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:55,251
Take the blood out of his tail!

322
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,293
- Stay out of his vision!
- Right!

323
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,043
Make it straight now!

324
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:11,500
Push back!

325
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,751
He never even knew I was there!

326
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:21,542
I told you he was snoozing.

327
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,335
What did Marsha say?

328
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:31,335
They're all moving toward our present position now.

329
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:32,751
Very slowly.

330
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:46,542
Let's rest.

331
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,751
We have very little oxygen left us.

332
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:51,001
But they're on their way.

333
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,709
- Looking for us.
- Through this heat?

334
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,084
They may not be able to make it through to us.

335
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:04,251
You better hope they'll get through it and spot us.

336
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:14,210
I'm beginning to feel like my head's swimming.

337
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:16,834
Of course.

338
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:19,293
It's your torn suit.

339
00:27:20,043 --> 00:27:21,792
The infection is getting through.

340
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,417
- Maybe we oughtta take some Quinsel —
- No.

341
00:27:25,168 --> 00:27:26,959
We'd have to rest after.

342
00:27:27,876 --> 00:27:30,542
Must... keep...

343
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:33,084
moving.

344
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:03,459
The shoreline's the best.

345
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:05,667
If we do, my friend, we'll never make it to 'em.

346
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,417
Fat chance there is of finding 'em.

347
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:25,334
That noise again!

348
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:26,375
Hold off?

349
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,210
Almost sounds like a girl.

350
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:58,126
A girl?

351
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:00,126
Perhaps.

352
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,168
Or a monster.

353
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,834
It's a human sound.

354
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,375
Well, there are sure no humans here.

355
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:17,417
Well, we're humans.

356
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:21,001
Well, no one else has made it. You better believe it.

357
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,584
But it sounds so human.

358
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:25,751
Sub-human, you mean, like that forty-armed
plant that just grabbed you.

359
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:27,126
I still say it's a girl.

360
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:29,834
A girl! With blue scales!

361
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,709
Could be he's on to something.

362
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,667
It's possible that before us, other men got here.

363
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,626
Especially in this age.

364
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,210
You ought to know that, Hans.

365
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,417
To a man of science, anything is possible
until proven otherwise.

366
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,959
It wouldn't be surprising if maybe
Andre'd find something.

367
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:54,085
Furthermore, this whole galaxy could be
explored and inhabited.

368
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:59,626
Well, I can't imagine any people in their right
mind exploring planet Venus.

369
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:03,501
Come on, Hans.

370
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:06,959
We're here. And we're in our right minds.

371
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,918
- Aren't we?
- Ha! Let's go.

372
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:56,334
To cross water. My magnetism
is in danger.

373
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,793
Need protection.

374
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:02,292
Alright, John. Find shelter.

375
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,126
Don't stop.

376
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:22,626
- We have to go on.
- Come on up.

377
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:50,417
We can't stay here. We'll be washed away.

378
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:57,751
Bring him this way. There is no water.

379
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,584
Come on.

380
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,043
A little bit further.

381
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:04,043
There's a cave right over there.

382
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:05,459
Come on.

383
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,251
That's it.

384
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,209
Just a few steps further.

385
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:19,834
There.

386
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:23,960
There.

387
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:32,793
I don't think I can go much further.

388
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,668
John, stay with us.

389
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,125
Make sure they find us.

390
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,001
They should know. Trust.

391
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:47,001
Must continue to work the laws of mathematics.

392
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:51,251
There's always a precise probability
mathematics might prove...

393
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:53,376
mathematics might...

394
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:01,125
Marsha... Marsha.

395
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:04,084
Hear us. Hear us, Marsha.

396
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,543
You... you must help us.

397
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,001
It's... it's close in here.

398
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:17,001
I await your orders. I await your orders.

399
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:22,417
Help.

400
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,793
Find us.

401
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,001
John.

402
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:30,084
Kern, Sherman.
Kern, Sherman.

403
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:31,751
Come in, please.

404
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:33,459
Come in, please.

405
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:36,417
Kern, Sherman, answer, please.

406
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:45,042
Hans Walters, do you hear me?

407
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,334
I sure do. What seems to be the matter?

408
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,960
What makes you think there's something wrong?

409
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,876
I can always tell by the tone of your voice.

410
00:33:55,543 --> 00:34:00,543
Oh. Well, I can't seem to contact Kern and Sherman
any longer. I don't know what's happened to them.

411
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:02,751
We're on our way to them now.

412
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,334
So just keep trying.

413
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,876
Will do.

414
00:34:09,084 --> 00:34:11,292
- Lord save 'em.
- What?

415
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,960
No response from Kern or Sherman.

416
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,042
Well, we should soon be there.

417
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:17,209
Keep trying.

418
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:19,084
Maybe we can bring them in on the helmet mike.

419
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,876
Kern has an auxiliary.

420
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:22,793
I am.

421
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,167
I'm getting him.

422
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:29,459
A woman.

423
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:30,959
Must be Marsha.

424
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:34,000
Static's really awful.

425
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:35,626
Hear it?

426
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,251
has been slightly damaged.

427
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,709
the frequency...

428
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:49,376
Move it up.

429
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,626
Going to a point on the dial, we'll find them.

430
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,209
I'll try it.

431
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:57,584
Hello.

432
00:34:58,292 --> 00:34:59,418
John, hello.

433
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:02,251
John, listen. This is the command ship.

434
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:03,501
Are you there?

435
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:06,918
- Come in.
- Up one more place.

436
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,543
Come in.

437
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:10,251
Better go to solar battery.

438
00:35:10,584 --> 00:35:11,501
Much bigger reach.

439
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,917
I'm on it now.

440
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:15,000
Hello. Hello.

441
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,751
Hello. You must hear me, John.

442
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,251
Please open your mike and answer me!

443
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:21,917
You must obey me, John.

444
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,793
No response.

445
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,501
Try another point.

446
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,042
One, two, five.

447
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:33,917
You have to readjust your frequency
for transmitting, if you hear me.

448
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:36,501
I hear you.

449
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:38,459
I have adjusted.

450
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:42,209
Can you report your position and plot number? Over.

451
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:45,334
Square 40, in shelter.

452
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:47,626
Tell me what's outside.

453
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:52,126
Waterfalls above falling on large rocks.

454
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:53,959
- That's square 40.
- Not far.

455
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,626
Ask him about the men.

456
00:35:56,209 --> 00:36:01,292
Hello. We would like to know about
Kern and also about Sherman.

457
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:07,710
They will not be safe to pass with.

458
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:14,959
How much time before we get there?

459
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,668
- Who knows?
- Commander, maybe the robot can help.

460
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:19,251
Try.

461
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,001
Keep an eye on the compass.

462
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,959
Drive out to them.

463
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,293
Hello, you will listen, John.

464
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:31,084
First, you will obey me and do precisely what I say.

465
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,251
You will listen.

466
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,167
Listen, John.

467
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,334
Obey my every command.

468
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:44,167
Remove container 2 from Kern's first aid kit.

469
00:36:44,543 --> 00:36:47,001
Repeat. Container 2.

470
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:05,334
Remove one tablet.

471
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,209
One tablet.

472
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,834
Then open his helmet.

473
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:18,126
I have one tablet.

474
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,875
Place the tablet in his mouth.

475
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:24,084
You must do this quickly.

476
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,084
Revive him with water.

477
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,084
Pour it over his face.

478
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,917
Quickly, then close his helmet.

479
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:57,459
At 0915 hours, I transmitted all data status
from Venus to Lunar Station 7.

480
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:03,710
At 0130 hours, I passed, in orbit, over the aircar.

481
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:08,042
It was at that time about to embark
on the Venusian Ocean.

482
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,876
At least we know they're alive.

483
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,251
Let's hope they stay that way.

484
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:19,293
Commander! Look there.

485
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:27,334
I'm ready for the action.

486
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:28,501
It's a kind of flying reptile!

487
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:30,293
He may not see us.

488
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:36,834
He hit us! He's turning around!

489
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,126
We're in for it now. He knows we're here!

490
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:43,459
Take it down!

491
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,626
Here he comes!

492
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,251
Don't miss him.

493
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:53,959
Marsha.

494
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,792
We're being attacked by a flying animal.

495
00:38:58,293 --> 00:38:59,668
Aircar damage.

496
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,334
Transmit to Lunar 7.

497
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:05,668
Commander Lockhart, what happened?

498
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:07,709
What shall I transmit?

499
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:25,001
Here he comes again!

500
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:30,917
Take 'em down.

501
00:39:43,501 --> 00:39:44,376
They're gone!

502
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:59,626
Lunar Station 7...

503
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,667
This is Marsha Evans calling from Command Ship Vega.

504
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:05,834
Marsha Evans calling from Command Ship Vega.

505
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:07,876
Yes, Marsha, we read you.

506
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:09,959
I need emergency protection immediately.

507
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,293
Professor Hartford speaking. What is it, Ms. Evans?

508
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:17,084
I have now lost contact with both parties on Venus.

509
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,709
At last contact, Lockhart, Ferneau and Walters...

510
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,792
were being attacked in the aircar over water
by an unknown flying animal.

511
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:30,084
They apparently have submerged and I'm afraid
they may need my help. Shall I land?

512
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:34,209
Listen carefully, Evans. It would be
extremely —

513
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,917
Lunar Station 7?

514
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:41,917
Lunar Station 7, I can't hear you. Come in, please.

515
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:43,876
Hello, Vega.

516
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,043
- ... your instructions...
- Come in, Vega.

517
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:49,001
What is it? What's happened with Vega?

518
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,625
Just a moment, doctor, I'm checking the power.

519
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:54,876
Calling Vega. Calling to Evans at Vega.

520
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:57,168
Attention, Marsha Evans.

521
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:00,876
Under no circumstances are you to leave orbit now.

522
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:02,501
This is extremely important.

523
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,709
I'm sorry, doctor. We just can't get through
to her. I'm afraid there's a short in the power.

524
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,501
Find it and fix it!

525
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,625
We simply can't allow it to go now!

526
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,792
Dr. Hartman, come in please.

527
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,834
I just don't know what to do.

528
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,251
The aircar isn't fit for submerging.

529
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:49,418
If their suits aren't damaged, they could get out.

530
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:51,501
But maybe they're hurt.

531
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,542
And if they are, they need my help.

532
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:00,501
I can only land on the next orbit.

533
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:07,335
I'll have to wait an hour yet, before switching on the propeller.

534
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,500
A whole hour.

535
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:15,335
But I feel I must go to them. I must!

536
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,792
Let's put it down for a minute, take a rest.

537
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:50,834
It's not far to the beach,
if our calculations are correct.

538
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,418
I hope this will run again.

539
00:42:56,335 --> 00:42:57,542
Don't worry, it will.

540
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,209
Look, the cliffs are all in even rows.

541
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:06,918
Like streets.

542
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:10,168
I'll look around, just five minutes.

543
00:43:10,542 --> 00:43:11,709
Might find something interesting.

544
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,209
Look.

545
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:18,751
That's a shark's tail.

546
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:21,667
Yes, but with the head of a dolphin.

547
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,667
Andre, don't go to far!

548
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:11,667
Found a cave. Only the entrance looked like it's been carved.

549
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,168
You've gone far enough!

550
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:18,751
Why don't you come back now?

551
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,834
Just a quick look. Might find something.

552
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:41,542
Commander!

553
00:44:50,043 --> 00:44:51,001
Well, what do ya know?

554
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,876
It's... It's a statue.

555
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:56,751
Andre!

556
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:01,334
What's up?

557
00:45:02,293 --> 00:45:03,459
You just look here.

558
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:08,043
- That's only a petrified tree.
- Only? Why, it's a bronze statue!

559
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:11,501
And much more, Hans.

560
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,918
Rubies.

561
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:15,459
You say rubies?

562
00:45:15,918 --> 00:45:16,667
Show me.

563
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:19,626
Simple.

564
00:45:21,043 --> 00:45:22,251
The eye of an idol.

565
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,584
An idol?

566
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,459
Yes, a reptile.

567
00:45:28,168 --> 00:45:31,126
A reptile resembling that flying monster that attacked us earlier.

568
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:33,001
Up there.

569
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:35,667
You're right, Andre. I'm not laughing anymore.

570
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:39,043
- There was a civilization here.
- And I'll bet ya there still is.

571
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:14,918
Look, Kern! Volcanic, foam-like metal!

572
00:46:15,584 --> 00:46:16,918
It absorbs oxygen!

573
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,626
Pull harder, John!

574
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:38,876
Harder!

575
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:42,501
Can you imagine a home built out
here in this beautiful valley?

576
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:43,793
Looks nice.

577
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:47,709
Don't expect too many visits from me if you do,
my friend. I'm ready.

578
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:49,959
Look, we'd have fun fighting the lizard men!

579
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:52,250
Look! The tree's falling!

580
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:53,751
It'll soon have our bridge.

581
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:13,459
Good work, John!

582
00:47:13,668 --> 00:47:17,793
We are ready to cross now.

583
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:20,417
Play some music!

584
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:22,459
To march across by!

585
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:28,459
What would you like to hear, Mr. Kern?

586
00:47:28,668 --> 00:47:31,001
Anything you are programmed to play, my dear John.

587
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:02,834
We're here.

588
00:48:03,209 --> 00:48:04,960
I couldn't've lasted much longer.

589
00:48:05,626 --> 00:48:06,709
You're not alone.

590
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:16,751
Here we are, Skipper.

591
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:19,626
Good. We'll need more fire.

592
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:21,668
Everything in the car is soaking wet.

593
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:29,251
Ah, feels good to sit.

594
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:31,417
How are the batteries, Hans?

595
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:32,542
They stayed dry.

596
00:48:34,918 --> 00:48:36,043
And the atom plant?

597
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:37,459
Still hot.

598
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,834
You've got that worried look again, Hans.

599
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:53,626
You're right. I've pulled and checked every wire
in that darn radio.

600
00:48:54,251 --> 00:48:55,251
It won't operate.

601
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:59,167
I've tried everything I know.

602
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:01,209
I tell ya, it's simply hopeless.

603
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:04,417
How 'bout a long string and an oatmeal box?

604
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:07,334
Oatmeal box!

605
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,584
The radio will dry out.

606
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:11,668
We know it's not a dead planet.

607
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:13,918
Not completely.

608
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,834
Our proof is the statue.

609
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:18,417
It will be.

610
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:22,918
- And the woman.
- She's probably somewhere.

611
00:49:23,584 --> 00:49:24,417
What do you say?

612
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:29,001
But the main thing is, there could be a whole
race of people out there watching us.

613
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:31,167
Hiding, afraid that we'll observe them.

614
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:32,376
And bite 'em?

615
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:34,376
We came from above.

616
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:39,001
Yeah, to them, we're probably some kind of monster.

617
00:49:39,835 --> 00:49:41,584
What if they're human-shaped?

618
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:43,334
They very well could look like us.

619
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:48,251
But mind you, I'm only advancing
a little hypothetical science fiction.

620
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:50,751
'Cause nothing should be overlooked.

621
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:54,918
Let's face it. They built the city that's
now under the sea.

622
00:49:58,001 --> 00:49:59,459
Hans, it must be true.

623
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:02,543
Many made it to shore from the sea.

624
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,459
Then, why didn't they build themselves another?

625
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,334
We may find they did.

626
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:09,751
When we explore the planet.

627
00:50:14,548 --> 00:50:16,590
Beautiful song and a beautiful girl.

628
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:20,965
She must've heard you.

629
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:22,882
Where is it?

630
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,673
Everywhere.

631
00:50:25,757 --> 00:50:27,590
Suppose it could be a woman?

632
00:50:30,256 --> 00:50:31,715
Or maybe she's helping us?

633
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:36,924
If I could just see what she looks like.

634
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:57,423
Can the car make it?

635
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:58,757
I'm sure.

636
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,298
Are you a lovely lady?

637
00:51:08,964 --> 00:51:14,423
Or a monster looking down on us with scorn,
breathing fire?

638
00:51:27,423 --> 00:51:28,423
Andre!

639
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:29,715
Andre!

640
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:39,715
Thanks for waiting.

641
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:42,256
She'd take care of you!

642
00:51:42,964 --> 00:51:44,256
Stop teasing him, Hans.

643
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,340
He's in love.

644
00:52:06,298 --> 00:52:09,715
- Strange. It's gotten suddenly dark.
- Well, no wonder!

645
00:52:10,048 --> 00:52:11,173
What makes you say that?

646
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:14,340
There's an ash cloud above us.

647
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,131
An ash cloud?

648
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,715
- A volcano.
- Yes.

649
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:27,298
It's spectacular.

650
00:52:28,006 --> 00:52:29,256
And beyond the volcano...

651
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:31,089
it looks like the lights of a city.

652
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:33,173
The red spot Andre saw.

653
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:37,256
- We must get a move on.
- Not right away.

654
00:52:37,548 --> 00:52:39,590
This might be our only chance to gather some samples!

655
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:41,173
Lava and ash.

656
00:52:41,757 --> 00:52:42,923
To take away with us.

657
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:47,173
Alright. We'll go to a much better
vantage point right now.

658
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,340
- Sherman, come.
- But look at the magnificence!

659
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,423
No one on Earth has seen such a sight.

660
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:30,715
Hurry, we've got to move to higher ground.

661
00:53:31,465 --> 00:53:32,340
I am hurrying.

662
00:53:32,715 --> 00:53:34,006
Are you getting the spectra sample?

663
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,381
Getting it now.

664
00:53:41,548 --> 00:53:42,507
That's enough.

665
00:53:43,048 --> 00:53:44,340
The lava is rising.

666
00:53:52,256 --> 00:53:53,382
We've waited too long.

667
00:53:53,673 --> 00:53:54,673
It's covered our path!

668
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:57,923
Perhaps we could run a rope.

669
00:53:58,382 --> 00:53:59,839
- How?
- We did before.

670
00:54:00,923 --> 00:54:03,048
- With John.
- There is no more time.

671
00:54:07,923 --> 00:54:10,798
- John?
- Yes, I hear you.

672
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,131
Carry us across the lava.

673
00:54:12,923 --> 00:54:13,923
Climb on, quick!

674
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:49,674
Audibility getting better.

675
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:51,507
Why's he talking?

676
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:58,131
Giving radio assistance
according to your request.

677
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:02,881
And determining distance, two miles.

678
00:55:03,923 --> 00:55:04,839
It's Lockhart!

679
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,674
I hope so, my friend.

680
00:55:07,048 --> 00:55:07,173
I'm sure!

681
00:55:08,465 --> 00:55:10,674
They'll be by here any minute, yelling taxi.

682
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,382
A remarkable invention you have here!

683
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,298
Nice to here you admit it, Allen.

684
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:25,632
Temperature for extremities,
five hundred degrees.

685
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:34,423
My self-preservation mechanism says I must
eliminate extra weight.

686
00:55:34,881 --> 00:55:36,090
What now?

687
00:55:36,714 --> 00:55:37,965
Disconnect the mechanism.

688
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:39,256
Where?

689
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:40,798
Open the door.

690
00:55:41,215 --> 00:55:42,714
- Here?
- Press panel.

691
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,548
- Hurry, or we're dead for sure.
- I have no wrench!

692
00:55:46,548 --> 00:55:47,923
Let me!

693
00:55:50,257 --> 00:55:55,673
I am forced to get rid of this weight.

694
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:01,714
He's gonna throw us off!

695
00:56:02,257 --> 00:56:03,465
Pull the wires!

696
00:56:10,507 --> 00:56:12,465
- He's going through the lava.
- Speed, Hans.

697
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:14,006
Press the tunnel!

698
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:17,006
I have! I've done everything!

699
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:20,465
Kern.

700
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:38,756
Kern...

701
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,798
We must hold on!

702
00:56:48,257 --> 00:56:48,965
They'll be here!

703
00:56:57,048 --> 00:56:57,839
Wish me luck.

704
00:56:58,756 --> 00:56:59,881
For God sakes, hurry.

705
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,090
He's here!

706
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,714
Sherman! Kern!

707
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:48,965
Commander!

708
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:52,006
- Andre!
- Here, let me help you out, my friend!

709
00:57:52,382 --> 00:57:54,673
I never thought I'd see your ugly face again.

710
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,881
We save 'em, and he insults us!

711
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:05,006
We should've saved Kern's robot instead!

712
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,465
Kern, you really did make it.

713
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:13,340
Is the robot finished?

714
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:15,798
Yes.

715
00:59:09,631 --> 00:59:11,132
Just a metal monster.

716
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:14,965
Yet, when his destruction was imminent...

717
00:59:15,923 --> 00:59:17,132
He called my name.

718
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,673
Looks pleasant and calm.

719
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:25,923
But frightening.

720
00:59:26,506 --> 00:59:30,340
Yes, I suppose it does, if you use imagination.

721
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:34,506
- We'll soon be home.
- That's right.

722
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,424
But we'll leave a friend behind.

723
00:59:39,548 --> 00:59:40,589
Come.

724
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:42,257
Join the rest of us.

725
00:59:54,589 --> 00:59:55,923
- Any luck?
- No.

726
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:58,881
No.

727
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,090
We'll be out of here soon.

728
01:00:05,673 --> 01:00:06,589
How do you know that?

729
01:00:06,923 --> 01:00:07,923
What else is there to do?

730
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,840
Well, we can look for Andre's girl.

731
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:24,298
Very cute, Hans.

732
01:00:26,548 --> 01:00:27,881
Did you name them after us?

733
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:32,548
Well, with triplets, it's better with numbers.

734
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:35,798
Looks to me like he's raising his own countdown.

735
01:00:36,715 --> 01:00:37,631
Why not names?

736
01:00:40,007 --> 01:00:41,132
Might forget.

737
01:00:41,506 --> 01:00:42,548
I'm worried about him.

738
01:00:45,132 --> 01:00:48,215
So you really found proof there were people on this planet?

739
01:00:49,506 --> 01:00:50,548
Hard to believe.

740
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:58,506
Believe it or not, my dear Mr. Kern, it's true.

741
01:00:59,464 --> 01:01:00,798
And they could still be here.

742
01:01:01,464 --> 01:01:02,340
I don't go along with that.

743
01:01:04,132 --> 01:01:07,173
Could a human survive in a place like this?

744
01:01:07,506 --> 01:01:08,299
You survived.

745
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:13,132
And man will almost always adapt himself in time.

746
01:01:13,756 --> 01:01:16,506
And don't forget, in the dim past we all lived in water.

747
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,173
For centuries, our earth was toxic.

748
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:22,631
But that atmosphere evolved mankind's form.

749
01:01:23,299 --> 01:01:24,673
Adjusting's the answer.

750
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:28,965
And I bet that these people on our planet couldn't live.

751
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:31,464
The air'd be poison.

752
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:33,881
Afraid I don't share your opinion.

753
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:36,132
You just can't close your mind to it.

754
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:40,965
We've found proof, proof of intelligent beings.

755
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:43,631
And those lizard men of Kern's. That's proof.

756
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:48,339
Look, suppose they do look like lizards.
Couldn't they be people?

757
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:51,548
Suppose they saw the ship.

758
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:55,257
Got frightened, then got their lizard costumes on...

759
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:58,090
Then jumped up and down to spook us away!

760
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:03,007
What possible story could explain it better, eh?

761
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:04,048
Now, you're the winner.

762
01:02:05,756 --> 01:02:11,173
Joking aside, my friend. Man, lizard or what...
I know there were or are intelligent people here.

763
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:12,715
If we just had time!

764
01:02:13,048 --> 01:02:15,090
I think they might come to us!

765
01:02:15,548 --> 01:02:20,173
Look, even you, Kern, said you thought you saw the
lights of a city beyond the volcano.

766
01:02:22,048 --> 01:02:24,381
I said they looked like, not were.

767
01:02:25,464 --> 01:02:28,548
Here, you two. Have some coffee and rest your voices.

768
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:35,007
That voice that comes to us now and then...

769
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:36,381
What does she look like?

770
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:39,756
If I could only see her...

771
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:42,048
She couldn't be anything but beautiful.

772
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:44,423
Why do I keep thinking about it?

773
01:02:46,339 --> 01:02:48,423
I'll probably never know the answer.

774
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:04,715
- Hey! Hey, watch that!
- Now, that's where you countdown!

775
01:04:32,214 --> 01:04:34,882
Better get out our locator, Andre.
She wants you to stay on path.

776
01:04:35,423 --> 01:04:39,256
- Just you wait.
- I think perhaps we should be trying to find her.

777
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,840
And take her with us!

778
01:04:42,506 --> 01:04:43,757
I vote for that.

779
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,298
But she might not like us much anyway.

780
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:51,715
If we can explore beyond those hills, I'd
bet ya money we'd find her. And the city.

781
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:54,506
You've been reading too many comics.

782
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:59,631
Kern wouldn't believe she existed if she
were sitting on his lap right now!

783
01:05:00,256 --> 01:05:01,214
Wanna bet?

784
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,923
We're here.

785
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,214
Boys, I think we did a job we can be proud of.

786
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:19,631
Look at all the samples we got!

787
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:24,548
There's gonna be a large headline when they
see all these great things we're bringin' back to 'em.

788
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,340
This one's loaded.

789
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,465
- Old man...
- Steady, child.

790
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:32,298
Bring the spectra.

791
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:45,381
That's the last.

792
01:05:48,173 --> 01:05:51,965
Commander Lockhart, hurry! We have
Marsha's recording from Vega!

793
01:05:55,798 --> 01:05:59,923
I hope the automatic recorders in Sirius
will record this message.

794
01:06:00,882 --> 01:06:05,381
I have been unable to contact Lunar Station 7 for further instructions.

795
01:06:06,256 --> 01:06:10,423
I cannot wait any longer while my fellow
astronauts are in need of my help.

796
01:06:11,757 --> 01:06:15,381
I am therefore disobeying Plan 1 and landing on Venus.

797
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,715
The dial of the automatic control system
is now indicating...

798
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:22,798
that in one minute the propellants
will be ignited.

799
01:06:23,256 --> 01:06:24,632
I —

800
01:06:35,715 --> 01:06:37,131
This is a mess now.

801
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:39,423
More than that.

802
01:06:40,173 --> 01:06:41,882
Marsha's mistake was the worst.

803
01:06:42,923 --> 01:06:43,882
The worst.

804
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:48,048
We'd better make a plan.

805
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:49,131
A good one.

806
01:07:02,173 --> 01:07:03,256
No more can this go.

807
01:07:03,632 --> 01:07:05,256
I hope she's still safe.

808
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:09,423
Hello, Vega. Hello, Vega.

809
01:07:09,924 --> 01:07:11,548
She may have crashed and burned.

810
01:07:12,673 --> 01:07:13,506
I pray not.

811
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:19,673
- We should notify Hartman.
- We can only contact Hartman through Vega.

812
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:24,381
Men, we must act.

813
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:31,381
You Sherman, Kern, Andre, I suggest this.

814
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:33,006
Maybe she's there.

815
01:07:34,298 --> 01:07:36,715
Hans and I must blast up in orbit.

816
01:07:37,757 --> 01:07:39,131
We will try to locate Vega.

817
01:07:40,006 --> 01:07:43,089
If we find her there at all, and I pray we do...

818
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,673
We'll contact you and Dr. Hartman.

819
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:47,840
- Yes, sir.
- How do the rest of you feel?

820
01:07:48,924 --> 01:07:51,964
I'm for moving on just as fast as we can get airborne.

821
01:07:57,964 --> 01:07:59,006
Quickly, Andre!

822
01:07:59,548 --> 01:08:00,256
Come on!

823
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:12,507
This was all level ground when we landed!

824
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,381
The stream's cutting a whole new channel above!

825
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:18,840
Kern, look here!

826
01:08:21,048 --> 01:08:22,340
A crack running clear across!

827
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:23,923
Widens any more and we'll all be lost!

828
01:08:24,715 --> 01:08:26,757
Quick! Lighten ship for emergency blast-off!

829
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:28,006
Maybe we can beat it!

830
01:08:45,507 --> 01:08:47,089
Hurry, the weather station's next.

831
01:09:02,757 --> 01:09:03,964
It's Marsha!

832
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:07,006
Hans, when was the last transmission from Marsha?

833
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,715
7:20.

834
01:09:09,048 --> 01:09:10,423
I thought I heard you say you saw her.

835
01:09:11,131 --> 01:09:12,923
I didn't, but radar did.

836
01:09:13,256 --> 01:09:15,256
There's a record of her passing after that time.

837
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:21,256
She didn't land after all.

838
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,423
She's still up there.

839
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:23,465
You sure?

840
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:26,507
Let's track her.

841
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:33,757
Marsha, hello. Come in.

842
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:35,340
Marsha, what happened to you?

843
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:39,757
I'm alright. Professor Hartman reached me again.

844
01:09:40,006 --> 01:09:41,465
Just as the ship was about to start.

845
01:09:42,673 --> 01:09:45,215
He ordered me to wait, no matter how I felt.

846
01:09:45,923 --> 01:09:49,590
He made me realize my responsibility. I'm
very grateful to him now.

847
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:51,173
But your orbit is —

848
01:09:51,964 --> 01:09:55,340
Well, the propellant had already started
and it changed before I could shut them off.

849
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:58,090
Now Hartman's plan makes good sense.

850
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:02,381
Hello, now give me your new orbit plot and position.

851
01:10:05,048 --> 01:10:08,048
Attention! Everyone return to the ship.

852
01:10:09,632 --> 01:10:11,964
- What could it be?
- We've heard from Marsha!

853
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,632
She's still in orbit!

854
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:17,298
Marsha!

855
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,839
Andre, throw the switch on the weather station!

856
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:24,256
Yes, sir.

857
01:10:43,173 --> 01:10:44,173
Hurry, Andre!

858
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:45,256
Hurry, Andre!

859
01:10:45,548 --> 01:10:46,382
Just finished.

860
01:11:06,173 --> 01:11:07,465
Look what I found!

861
01:11:10,006 --> 01:11:11,507
Hey! They're humans!

862
01:11:24,048 --> 01:11:25,715
Look! Look, her face!

863
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:33,048
Commander, they're like us! Don't you see?
They're like us!

864
01:11:33,465 --> 01:11:36,173
We must stay! We must stay!

865
01:13:20,756 --> 01:13:25,798
And so, man's search for intelligent life on other planets
and in other galaxies...

866
01:13:26,257 --> 01:13:27,257
will continue.

867
01:13:27,756 --> 01:13:33,756
For this is the heart and the meaning of that
great adventure... the exploration of the universe.
