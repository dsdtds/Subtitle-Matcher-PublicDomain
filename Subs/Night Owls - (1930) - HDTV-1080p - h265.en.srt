1
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:38,558
Hey, look here!

2
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:40,860
Who was on duty in my
neighborhood last night?

3
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:42,562
Why...

4
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:45,389
I was, sir.

5
00:00:48,192 --> 00:00:49,035
You were?

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,837
Yes, sir.

7
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,337
I was down there all night.

8
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:54,307
Did you look at this morning's paper?

9
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:54,508
No.

10
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,075
No, I didn't see this morning's.

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,911
You didn't?

12
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:57,944
No.

13
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,039
Well, take a squint at this.

14
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,694
Well, what about it?

15
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:17,797
I'm just about fed up
with your kind of stuff.

16
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:19,365
Now listen to me.

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,734
If there's any more robberies in

18
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,035
that neighborhood and you don't

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,704
make an arrest, you're fired!

20
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:26,339
You get me?

21
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:27,635
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,754
Poor old Kennedy.

23
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,016
The only way that you'll ever
make an arrest is frame it yourself.

24
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:50,021
Frame it myself.

25
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:55,635
Frame it myself.

26
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,277
Come on, come on.

27
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:04,944
Come on.

28
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:05,779
Get up out of this.

29
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:06,747
Come on.

30
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:09,415
Get up, get up.

31
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,460
Get up out of there.

32
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:19,667
I suppose you fellas know you can
get 90 days on the rock pile for this.

33
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:22,002
If I should let you go,

34
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:25,881
would you do... me a little favor?

35
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,804
We'd be glad to.

36
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,041
Kennedy's my name.

37
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,175
Mr. Hardy's mine.

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,144
This is Mr. Laurel, Mr. Kennedy.

39
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,229
How do you do, Mr. Laurel?

40
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:44,733
Now, here's the proposition.

41
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,945
The chief and I are on the outs,

42
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:51,573
and I want to get on
the good side of him.

43
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:52,959
Naturally.

44
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,535
Certainly.

45
00:02:56,154 --> 00:03:01,500
What I want you boys to do is to
go up and rob the chief's house.

46
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:08,841
Why, we'd be arrested.

47
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:11,093
That's the idea.

48
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,979
And I will arrest you.

49
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:15,931
That will put me in
good with the chief.

50
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,645
But what's going to become of us?

51
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,357
Oh.

52
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,292
Don't let that worry you.

53
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,110
Kennedy will fix it.

54
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,533
We won't do it.

55
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:38,004
All right.

56
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:40,507
Then the rock pile for you.
Come on.

57
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:42,108
Just a moment.

58
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,077
Pardon me.

59
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,078
I'll speak with my friend.

60
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,013
Just a little conference.

61
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,089
Well, make it snappy.

62
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:58,927
No good will come of it, and
we'll be put in... put in jail.

63
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:02,186
Excuse me.

64
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,339
All right?

65
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,109
We'll do it.

66
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:14,040
I thought you would.

67
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:19,312
You looked like you had
intelligence, and so do...

68
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:21,872
Come on, and I'll show you where
that house is.

69
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:05,457
That's the house.

70
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,363
Now, be as quiet as you can.

71
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,091
I'll see you later.

72
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,939
It's the garbage men, sir.

73
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,360
Climb over the wall.

74
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,497
Oh!

75
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:45,865
Shhhh!

76
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,033
Don't shush me.

77
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,168
Pick those things up.

78
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:57,384
What's the matter?

79
00:05:57,735 --> 00:05:59,303
I'm scared.

80
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,882
There's nothing to be afraid of.

81
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,557
Kennedy will fix it.

82
00:06:18,456 --> 00:06:19,781
Come on. Let's go.

83
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,451
Oh!

84
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:25,542
Oh!

85
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,138
Shh!

86
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,107
Shhh!

87
00:06:58,429 --> 00:06:59,409
Aah!

88
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:18,757
Hey!

89
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,092
Hey!

90
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,551
Oh!

91
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,782
Shhh!

92
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,094
Shh!

93
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:35,459
Shh!

94
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:13,038
See what that racket is out there.

95
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,176
Oh, it's the cats, sir.

96
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:30,764
Let's pretend we're cats.

97
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:41,108
Do something about it.

98
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,235
Will you quit your playing?

99
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:29,316
Shh!

100
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,908
Shh!

101
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,032
Get in.

102
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:13,625
I'm afraid.

103
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,229
There's nothing to be afraid of.

104
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,538
Kennedy will fix it.
Now come on.

105
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,651
Oh, shoot!

106
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,698
Get something, quick!

107
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,593
Oh!

108
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,749
Get your hands off of it.

109
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:49,379
Why don't you do something to help me?

110
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:52,049
What can I do?
It blew shut.

111
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,393
Oh, "blew."

112
00:12:54,518 --> 00:12:57,804
Now we've got to go
through the window again.

113
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,101
Get on it.

114
00:14:27,177 --> 00:14:28,354
Shh!

115
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,729
Oh...

116
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,541
Hey! Psst!

117
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:28,404
Oooh!

118
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,641
Oh!

119
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:53,038
Shhhh!

120
00:15:53,272 --> 00:15:56,524
Will you get me the hammer, please?

121
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,839
Aah!

122
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:24,219
Shh!

123
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,137
Shh!

124
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,001
Shh!

125
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,943
Shh!

126
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:37,333
Shh!

127
00:17:38,577 --> 00:17:41,004
Get me something to tie this with.

128
00:18:14,013 --> 00:18:15,747
Did you ring, sir?

129
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:20,210
No, I didn't ring, sir!

130
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,796
Would you get out of here so I
can get some sleep?

131
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,092
I believe you're getting old

132
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:29,552
and nutty.

133
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:36,893
We'll wait here for Kennedy.
And don't make any noise.

134
00:18:40,272 --> 00:18:43,691
I told you, keep quiet!

135
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:13,638
Meadows, quit playing
the piano this time of night!

136
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:17,618
Oh!

137
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,053
Meadows!

138
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,687
Yes, sir?

139
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,564
You go and phone the police.

140
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:32,073
- Me?
- Yes, you. Hurry up.

141
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,342
Aaah!

142
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,310
Kennedy!

143
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,704
So it's you that's been
robbing the neighborhood!

144
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,322
You'll get life for this!

145
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:17,670
There's the police now!

146
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:18,837
Hurry up, will you?

147
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,372
Give me a good pull!

148
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:23,133
I'm doing the best I can!
