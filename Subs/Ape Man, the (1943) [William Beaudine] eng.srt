-Was she nice?

168
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,329
-Yeah, but she lied to me.

169
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,205
-Oh?

170
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,313
-She told me her boyfriend
was in boot camp.

171
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,509
Okay, Mason, let's go.

172
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,240
Mason?

173
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,289
-I'm Billy Mason.

174
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,231
-Huh?

175
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,230
-I said, I'm Billy Mason.

176
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,080
I'm taking Barney's
place, whoever he is.

177
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,393
-Well, why didn't you say so?

178
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:16,318
Come on.
Let's go.

179
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,999
-Where are we
going if I may ask?

180
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:37,286
-The Poindale, the
old Brewster home.

181
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,159
Gonna interview a screwy old
dame and get some pictures.

182
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,720
Good pictures, I hope.

183
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,730
-Why the I hope?

184
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,090
A good reporter generally
gets an interview.

185
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,509
-I'm not worried about
the interview,

186
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,939
it's the pictures
I'm worried about.

187
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:50,800
-Oh, I get it.

188
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,439
Well, listen, Mr. Insane,
you take care of your end of it

189
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,320
and don't worry about mine.

190
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,499
My pictures will be as
good as your interview.

191
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:58,949
And maybe a little bit better.

192
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,770
-Cocky little wench, aren't you?

193
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,609
-Well, I've had to hold my
own against four brothers

194
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:03,730
all my life.

195
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,030
I guess I can handle a
4F like you.

196
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,780
-All right.

197
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,430
And what gives you the
idea I'm a 4F?

198
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,119
-Well, I can't think of
any other good reason

199
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,750
you're not in uniform.

200
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,364
-Listen, baby, you're looking
smack dab at a 14 carat 1A.

201
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,719
Totally fit, physically perfect
with a personal letter

202
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,450
in his pocket from
the president.

203
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,715
30 days from now
I'll be Jefferson B. Carter,

204
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,189
seaman first class.

205
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,570
-Oh.

206
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,291
-Oh, yes.

207
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,040
30 days hath
September, April,

208
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,609
June, and Jefferson B. Carter.

209
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:32,470
-Well, I'll take back the
part about 4F.

210
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,259
But the rest of it still stands.

211
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:36,840
-It makes me wish I was
in the Navy right now.

212
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,070
-That makes two of us.

213
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,890
All right, sailor.

214
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,983
Shove off.

215
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,719
-You have no idea
what I have gone

216
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:11,160
through in the
last three months.

217
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,547
Sometimes I am perfectly normal.

218
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,766
But later,

219
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,777
I sit for hours and hours

220
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,507
looking in the mirror

221
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:23,427
hoping

222
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,450
and praying for
the slightest sign

223
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:28,392
on my face to change.

224
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:32,035
It doesn't come.

225
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,978
And I feel myself holding back
the animal instinct.

226
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,569
I try to fight it.

227
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:46,639
And I try to fight it
with all my willpower.

228
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:50,415
And I feel it's not limited.

229
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,810
I locked myself in
there with him fearing

230
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,576
that I might do
something terrible.

231
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,319
Oh, I can't stand it any longer.

232
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:08,239
I can't stand it.

233
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:11,129
But I am the
master of me.

234
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,890
I must do what I am asking him.

235
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,939
-What did you ask him to do, James,
and he refused?

236
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:24,561
-I must have human spinal
fluid injected into me.

237
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,650
It's my only chance.

238
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,000
Randall and I both agreed to it.

239
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,199
It's the only way to counteract
the ape fluid injection.

240
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:37,934
But he won't do it.

241
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,560
Won't do it.

242
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,400
-Please, James, please.

243
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,410
I'll talk to George.

244
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,799
I know he'll do
anything to save you.

245
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,719
I'll ask him.

246
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,890
-No, he won't.

247
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,062
I pleaded... and begged.

248
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,269
-James tells me you refused
to help him any further.

249
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,559
-Did he tell you why?

250
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,211
-No.

251
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,490
-Then I'll tell you.

252
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,149
I'd have to commit
murder to do it.

253
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:08,801
-Murder?

254
00:17:08,851 --> 00:17:10,690
-Yes, cold blooded murder.

255
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,169
You see this spinal fluid,
it might might cure him.

256
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,209
And there's a great
possibility it would.

257
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,270
Discuss the chance with him.

258
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,099
That fluid must be taken
from a living person.

259
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:22,949
And the taking of it
means instant death.

260
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,582
-Oh.

261
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,659
-Well, I must say the house
matches the old girl to a t.

262
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:33,920
-What do you mean?

263
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,230
-She's a ghost hunter?

264
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,399
-Did you say ghost?

265
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,050
-Yeah.

266
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,911
Ever see any?

267
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,399
-[LAUGHS] Don't be silly.

268
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:40,580
-She has.

269
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,280
[LAUGHS]

270
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,241
No kidding.

271
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,680
She's written books about them.

272
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,419
She's been all over
the world poking around

273
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:47,569
in cemeteries and
haunted houses.

274
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:51,058
She just got back from a Cook's tour
of haunted castles in Europe.

275
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:51,980
[CHUCKLES]

276
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,571
Come on,
let's go over there.

277
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,072
-Oh, I, ah, forgot my camera.

278
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,219
-That's your job.

279
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,500
[BANGING]

280
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:09,851
-Shut up!
Stop that racket!

281
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,190
[GORILLA SOUNDS]

282
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,579
-Well, here's a chance for
you to photograph a ghost.

283
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:30,259
-Very funny.
Very funny.

284
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,481
-Better see who it is.

285
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,709
It may allay any suspicions
those screams arouse.

286
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:52,709
Jim has probably seen who
it is in the televisor.

287
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:54,170
He won't give himself away.

288
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,441
-Hello.

289
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,160
Remember me from the boat?

290
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,910
Jeff Carter?

291
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
-Oh, yes.

292
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,360
-Uh, this is Billy Mason.

293
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,829
I brought her along to
get some more pictures.

294
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,830
The others were lou--
they weren't good.

295
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,210
-Well, uh, I'm afraid it's
too dark in here for pictures.

296
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,098
-Oh, no, it'll be perfectly okay.

297
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,718
-Oh sure, it's okay.

298
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,609
She, eh, takes pictures
in tunnels.  [LAUGHS]

299
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,663
-All right.

300
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,760
-I'll be going, Miss Brewster.

301
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,809
Just keep on with the
prescription I gave you.

302
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,810
-Oh, I, I will, doctor.

303
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,270
Won't you come into the library?

304
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:51,020
-If you don't mind,
Miss Brewster,

305
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,009
I'd like to know a little more
about your work, your book,

306
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:53,951
your successes.

307
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,479
I think our readers
would be interested.

308
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,470
-Oh, certainly.

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,749
Won't you sit down?

310
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,816
-Thanks.

311
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,879
-I hope you'll pardon the
affairs of this room.

312
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,859
But I don't dare change a thing.

313
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:11,859
The entities that haunt this
house will not appear

314
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,877
if they spy a difference.

315
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:17,539
They only want the old
familiar things.

316
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,796
-You mean this house
is really haunted?

317
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:24,260
-Certainly, child, all
houses are haunted.

318
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,188
All prisons are haunted.

319
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,975
Throngs of spirits
follow us everywhere.

320
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,040
We are never alone.

321
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,910
This room is crowded right now.

322
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,889
-I don't see anything.

323
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:43,980
-Oh, you can't see them,
anymore than you can see the room.

324
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,051
They can destroy you
just for peering through the veil.

325
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:52,800
Some spirits are honest,
gentle and kind,

326
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,279
and all they want is to
bring happiness and peace.

327
00:20:56,682 --> 00:21:00,000
But a few are evil.
