1
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,418
A fine piece of property.
With a little work and attention ..

2
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:54,096
Too bad to see it go for a song, sir.

3
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,818
Too bad for Hugh Dawltry, I say.

4
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:58,693
Yes. The Gymkhana Club.

5
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,827
Not at all my, dear Reginald.
Not at all. It's this way you see.

6
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:32,168
But Simpson, old fellow.
I told you I did not see.

7
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:36,496
But my dear Reginald, you must see.
- But how can I see when I don't see?

8
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,458
That is just the point.
If you did, you could.

9
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:41,860
But I told you I didn't, old fellow.

10
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,545
Anyone about?
- Hello, Wey-Smith.

11
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:51,713
We're going to be officially rid
of that bounder Dawltry at last.

12
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:54,434
The poor devil will be
only a memory soon.

13
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,795
And a jolly bad one.

14
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,779
He should have been expelled
from the club long ago.

15
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:01,138
Rules, my dear Everard. Rules.

16
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,497
This country is a stickler for rules.
- And honour, old fellow.

17
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,895
Without it none of us could live
in this beastly climate, what?

18
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:09,836
Stuffy in here, eh?

19
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:12,222
Hey there.

20
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:13,606
Punkah-wallah.

21
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:19,048
That's better.
- What's the difference?

22
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,245
It doesn't cool off this
climate to keep it moving.

23
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:23,895
A Scotch and soda might.

24
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,351
How about it?
- Yes.

25
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,851
A Scotch and soda.
- Twice.

26
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:31,708
Seen the evening paper?

27
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:34,618
Same as yesterdays, isn't it?
- All except the shipping news.

28
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:35,948
What's new about that?

29
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,475
Nobody but cooks,
tourists and missionaries ..

30
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:41,489
Would be foolish enough to stick
their heads into this furnace.

31
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,966
Well, I'd hardly call Hugh
Dawltry a missionary.

32
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,070
Dawltry?
- That's the gentleman.

33
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,400
There is his name on the
next boat's passenger list.

34
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,017
Coming back to Khota?

35
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,963
He wouldn't have the crust.

36
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:56,224
I can't believe that is true.

37
00:02:56,673 --> 00:02:59,327
He had crust enough to say
this place is an old ladies' home.

38
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:01,154
And to say it right to our faces.

39
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,874
Why didn't he keep out of it then?

40
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:04,714
He did, most of the time.

41
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:07,958
He seemed to like the homes of
the younger ladies much better.

42
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,579
A man who won't respect the moral
code down here doesn't belong.

43
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:15,364
There's no law against stealing other
men's wives if they want to be stolen.

44
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,767
But you don't have to
associate with the thief.

45
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:19,957
He made that plain enough
before he cleared out.

46
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,863
It deserves a drink.
This unexpected homecoming.

47
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,450
I wonder what he came back for.

48
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:27,567
That plantation of his probably.

49
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:31,407
A stubborn fellow, Dawltry.
He needs good discipline.

50
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,198
You are quite right, Wey-Smith.

51
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:36,694
No woman is safe here if we
tolerate rotters like Dawltry.

52
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,065
Cheerio.
- Cheers to you.

53
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:41,031
Cheerio.

54
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:54,726
Yes, sir?

55
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,115
Ah, steward.

56
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:59,684
The young lady who sits at this table.

57
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:01,368
She ..

58
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,778
Seems to be dining rather
late this evening, huh?

59
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:05,359
I'm sorry, sir.

60
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,609
But Miss Crosby had dinner
served in her state room.

61
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:10,448
Oh.

62
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:13,527
Well, in that event I will ..

63
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,096
I will just have some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

64
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:17,898
And .. on deck.

65
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:19,898
Yes, sir.

66
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:22,234
Will you have breakfast here
sir, or at your own table?

67
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,694
I'll answer that one in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,317
You know, for a very
proper English lighter.

69
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,502
You should be ashamed of yourself.

70
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,206
A person would think that one
flame would be enough for you.

71
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,909
Without annoying every lady you see.

72
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:09,011
Even make them dine in
stuffy cabins to avoid you.

73
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,135
I'm going to make you apologise.

74
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,892
If I ever meet the charming lady.

75
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,837
In the meantime I think I'll drown
you in a tall brandy and soda.

76
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,586
For being so rude.

77
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:56,124
No.

78
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,101
Leave the bottle.

79
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:00,624
Why didn't you take me out?

80
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,796
So we'd lose the rubber my dear.

81
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,217
False chivalry.

82
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,213
It's too confounded hot for bridge.

83
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,363
Absurd, you know.
- And too hot to argue about it.

84
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:12,480
Is it your first trip out here?

85
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,443
No. But it is my last.

86
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,456
The tropics is no place for a white man.

87
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,679
Unless he has no place else to go.

88
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:20,409
Well, bridge helps.

89
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:23,224
Playing solitaire is a lonely game.

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,373
Out here.

91
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,136
Cyril, you ought to stick to rummy
or hearts or something like that.

92
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,738
I'm sorry, my dear.
I didn't deal the cards, you know.

93
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:33,585
Alright, I don't want to play the game.

94
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:45,226
There you are.

95
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,378
Thank you, sir. I hope you've
had a pleasant voyage.

96
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:49,564
Thank you.

97
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:51,224
We've docked, sir.

98
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,987
I fear Reggie, this is as
plain as a London fog.

99
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,104
I know my dear Simpson. I know.

100
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:07,952
But I can't see through it.

101
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:11,329
And if it wasn't so plain you
could. I know you could.

102
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:13,883
But that is just why
I can't, old fellow.

103
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:25,399
A beastly climate, sir.
Khota is the hottest port we make.

104
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,557
Perhaps I shan't mind it.

105
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,157
Goodbye, sir. Thank you again.

106
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:48,412
Goodbye, good luck.

107
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:59,407
You will find it gets rather damp.

108
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:00,849
Won't you join me?

109
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:24,108
If you're not careful you'll fall out of
that funny thing and break your neck.

110
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:27,266
And you'll be drowned. So why not take
this umbrella and save both our lives?

111
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:30,780
I can't take an umbrella from someone
whom I never expect to see again.

112
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,249
Most people do just that.
It's an international custom.

113
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:34,862
So. Our introduction.

114
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,308
I wonder how Adam met Eve.

115
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,557
It was probably raining.
- Not much harder than this surely?

116
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:42,920
Now see here.

117
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,041
Anyone can see you're a stranger here.

118
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:47,736
And since you have a
corner on transportation ..

119
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:49,173
Where may I take you?

120
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:58,590
You may drop me at
number 17 Khota Road East.

121
00:09:58,843 --> 00:09:59,515
17 ..?

122
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:01,725
17 Khota Road East?

123
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:02,881
Good.

124
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:25,920
The rain has stopped.

125
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,065
Do you think we need the
umbrella any longer?

126
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,695
Oh, the sun is just as bad.

127
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:34,149
You know when this country
gets tired of parboiling you ..

128
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:35,612
It begins baking you.

129
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,559
Until you are done to a crisp.

130
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:39,160
What a charming future.

131
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,507
Of course, I take it for granted that
you are going to be here for some time.

132
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:47,875
You are taking a lot for
granted, aren't you?

133
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:55,752
Well.

134
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:57,250
This is it.

135
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,133
I will .. help you in.

136
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:17,897
Rickshaw.

137
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:22,471
He ..

138
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,531
Said for us to go right in
and make ourselves at home.

139
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:26,982
Here we are.

140
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,409
The servant seems to
know you, Mr Dawltry.

141
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:32,789
Oh yes, yes. I am a
frequent visitor here.

142
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,718
Where is everybody, do you suppose?

143
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,977
Well, there only three places in
this town where they could be.

144
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:44,573
The bar of the club.

145
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,268
The card room of the club.

146
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,559
Or the swimming pool of the club.

147
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:53,634
You say they were expecting you?
- I cabled them of course.

148
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:57,235
Well, delivering the cable in
Khota is quite another matter.

149
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,400
Sometimes we get our
Christmas greetings by Easter.

150
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:01,842
You are an optimist.

151
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,177
Well, trying to be.

152
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:04,942
There goes your limousine.

153
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,190
Oh yes, yes. I .. I sent it away.

154
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,419
Well, how do you expect to get home?

155
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:15,052
I walk.

156
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,230
My bungalow is ..

157
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:18,883
Very close.

158
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,834
Won't you sit down?

159
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,407
Isn't that a lovely skin?

160
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,219
Yes, it is.

161
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,214
I'll see if I can't dig up
something to drink.

162
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:47,754
Doesn't George look funny.

163
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,951
Your brother was an intern
when that was taken.

164
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:56,780
They all look funny until practising
medicine makes them look worse.

165
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,653
Is that why you are still
a bachelor, Dr Muir?

166
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:02,029
That and my pocketbook.

167
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:03,997
George is lucky.

168
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:08,123
I couldn't find a girl who'd wait until
I made a success and then send for her.

169
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:10,164
Doctor Muir.

170
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,370
Hello everybody.

171
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:16,776
I say, these native women have babies at
the most unexpected times and places.

172
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:18,660
Well, where is the bride?

173
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,005
Isn't she with you?

174
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:22,331
An emergency call came
to the hospital just as I left.

175
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,475
So I sent Ali to the dock
in the car to meet her.

176
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,467
She should be here now.
The car is outside.

177
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:28,193
Ali .. Ali.

178
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,681
Ali, where are you?

179
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,484
What are you doing out here?
- Nothing, sahib.

180
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,155
Did you go to the boat as I told you?
- Yes, sahib. I go now.

181
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,813
You've been at the gin again?

182
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:40,135
No, sahib. Been at boat. Not see nobody.

183
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,209
Don't lie to me you
sneaking, heathen rat.

184
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:44,967
George, don't.

185
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,204
I will not tolerate drunken servants.

186
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:51,087
Everybody has got to keep
his place in this country.

187
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:53,492
What will Phil think if nobody
is at the boat to meet her?

188
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,821
The poor girl is probably
standing at the dock now.

189
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:57,322
Come on, some of you.

190
00:13:57,522 --> 00:13:58,537
I'll get the hats.

191
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,978
But my dear Jimmy, it was a leopard.

192
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,093
No, my dear Reggie. It was an elephant.
- I say it was a leopard.

193
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:24,631
An elephant.
- Leopard.

194
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,636
Elephant.

195
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,855
Rene, you can drive faster than this.

196
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,391
She is driving quite fast enough for me.

197
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:41,425
The boat must be in alright.
- Dawltry is home.

198
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,685
What about Dawltry?

199
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:45,741
You're so busy with the old hospital
you don't even hear any news.

200
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,234
News? What news?

201
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,924
Dawltry is coming back today.

202
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,885
On the same boat with Philippa?

203
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,022
They can't deliver a passenger
like him to women.

204
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:55,566
An outrage. Men like Dawltry
shouldn't be at large.

205
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,046
Cigarette?

206
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,030
I prefer Turkish.

207
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:16,054
He looks like such a
well-behaved little lighter.

208
00:15:19,921 --> 00:15:22,133
I can hardly believe all
the gossip about him.

209
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,015
Perhaps I was talking about ..

210
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,344
Myself.

211
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:34,404
Must you prove it?

212
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,762
I had no chance aboard the boat.

213
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,079
And you consider Dr March's
house a more suitable place?

214
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:47,723
This isn't Dr March's house.

215
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,339
I don't understand.

216
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,042
I lied to you.

217
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,976
This is my house.

218
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,273
And just why did you bring me here?

219
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:08,426
To get acquainted.

220
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,998
You were such a stranger
aboard the boat.

221
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,428
I'm still a stranger.

222
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,549
I hope you won't be after dinner.

223
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,979
My houseboy is really
a very excellent cook.

224
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,756
And I suppose his mater is
an excellent entertainer?

225
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,708
That depends upon the audience.

226
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,847
The audience is leaving.
Without any sign of applause.

227
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:29,680
And does this also ring down the
curtain on some future engagement?

228
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:30,969
I am afraid so.

229
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:32,581
Since I came here to end one.

230
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:35,063
By marrying Dr George March.

231
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:41,894
You are going to marry .. him?

232
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:42,764
Yes.

233
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:00,568
I'll see you along of course.
- No thank you.

234
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:02,113
I've had enough of guides.

235
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,503
It is the next plantation.

236
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,163
Thank you.

237
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,437
Just a neighbourly step.

238
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:25,492
You know, my dear.

239
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:27,520
Where are you going for your honeymoon?

240
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:30,013
Really I don't know yet, Mrs Wey-Smith.

241
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:31,160
Don't you know?

242
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:34,371
Where are we going, George?
- Going?

243
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:35,742
Going where?

244
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:37,205
On your honeymoon, doctor.

245
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:41,765
We are beyond such
juvenile customs as that.

246
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:43,009
Aren't we, dear?

247
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:44,692
You see, Philippa was a nurse.

248
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,934
At St Mary's when I was
house surgeon there.

249
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:47,956
Oh, I see.

250
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:50,287
We've more important things
than honeymoons to think of.

251
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,920
Haven't we?
We've a lot to talk over, eh Phil?

252
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:56,087
And the bungalow has been all done over.

253
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:57,896
Dressed up in your honour.

254
00:17:58,418 --> 00:17:59,462
New curtains and ..

255
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,226
You did get new curtains,
didn't you Rene?

256
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:04,511
Yes, George.

257
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,081
New curtains and twin beds.

258
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,019
Hmm. Yes.

259
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,758
Who is it, Khan?

260
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:29,670
Doctor sahib Muir.

261
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,293
Come in, Doc.

262
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,437
Come in.

263
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:36,077
Hello. Can I .. lend a hand?

264
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,252
Well you might hold a leg.

265
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:39,729
Cut.

266
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:41,431
Bite.

267
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:44,186
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

268
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:45,393
Not at all, Doc.

269
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:48,175
My hospitality is a byword in Khota.

270
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,263
So was your unexpected homecoming.

271
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:53,018
You're a bit late for a
welcoming committee, Doc.

272
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,678
I'm just acting as post-boy.

273
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:56,847
Your club box was full of
mail so I brought it up.

274
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:57,880
Thanks.

275
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:00,557
We can't get away from
the London Times, can we.

276
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:03,659
My guess is, this is about as close
as you intend to get to London.

277
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:06,093
For a while, by the look of things.

278
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,633
What's the use of continuing
in this place with ..

279
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,318
Every door closed against you?

280
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,323
Ah, forget it, Doc.

281
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,383
Alright little laddie? What do you say?

282
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:27,977
Now let that be a lesson to you.

283
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,579
Hereafter don't you get too
friendly with Johnny crocodile.

284
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:31,826
On your way.

285
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:33,970
Will you have one, Doc?

286
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:35,775
No. Too soon after luncheon.

287
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,955
Well, sit down and watch me then.

288
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:42,360
Wagering at my capacity is the latest
indoor sport at the Gymkhana Club.

289
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,463
Now I'm again a member in good standing.

290
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:47,451
You must have a very good reason to
stay on here in the face of everything.

291
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:48,788
Perhaps I have.

292
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,541
A very good one.

293
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,732
Another scandal like that ..

294
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,235
That last one.

295
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,171
Might prove serious.

296
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,091
The Doris Drayton divorce
case is still news.

297
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,257
The men here are very
down on you, Dawltry.

298
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:04,717
Are you?
- Huh?

299
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,266
No.

300
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:07,821
Confound it.

301
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:11,052
An old bachelor or like me
can afford to be neutral.

302
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:13,027
And anyway.

303
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,978
You remind me too much of myself.

304
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:17,584
Yourself?

305
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:19,704
I mean.

306
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:24,048
The self I would have liked to have been
at your age if I'd had your courage.

307
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,290
And your technique.

308
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,044
You cad.

309
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,470
George.

310
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:21,558
Sorry.

311
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,174
I thought you were asleep.

312
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,080
Confound that chair always being in
the middle of the room. I don't know ..

313
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:30,288
Every night the same thing happens.

314
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,478
You should wear a tail light also.

315
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,477
What do you mean? What is
funny about bumping my shin?

316
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,937
Go and look at yourself.

317
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:42,626
If there were beer bars in Khota at this
time of the night, I'd say you're tight.

318
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:46,044
My reflector. And I looked everywhere
for it before I left the hospital.

319
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,686
But it's a wonder I
didn't forget my head.

320
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:49,994
Why what happened?

321
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:52,006
A sacrococcygeal tumour.

322
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,575
You don't tell me.

323
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,746
It sounds like a new case of lockjaw.

324
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,380
Please, no. This is no joke.

325
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:02,565
Just imagine. Finding a sacrococcygeal
tumour right here in Khota.

326
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:03,823
Just imagine it.

327
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,397
Well I've never really
looked for one very hard.

328
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,921
They are very rare. You don't
bump into them everywhere.

329
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,979
They are as rare as
spondylosis deformans.

330
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:13,799
I haven't seen one for ..

331
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,022
Yes, five years.

332
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,119
You remember.

333
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:20,622
You were nursing at St Mary's back home.

334
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,017
But you must remember
your first surgical case.

335
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:29,268
I gave the anaesthetic.

336
00:22:30,664 --> 00:22:32,278
But this is much worse than that was.

337
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,268
This is .. look, Phil.

338
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:37,799
It's affected all these vertebrae.

339
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:39,744
But I want to show you.

340
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:43,188
It's affected all these vertebrae
down to the coccyx bone.

341
00:22:43,523 --> 00:22:45,438
Stop, you're hurting me.
- Not there?

342
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,105
Everywhere.

343
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,365
What's the matter, Phil?
Don't you feel well?

344
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:52,799
Perhaps I've a patient right here at
home and I've been too busy to notice.

345
00:22:53,074 --> 00:22:55,702
A doctor's family usually
does come last, doesn't it.

346
00:22:56,738 --> 00:22:59,433
Let me see your tongue.
- Oh please, I'm alright.

347
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:00,805
Go to bed.

348
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,106
I hope so.

349
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:07,212
You should have seen
that tumour. It was a beauty.

350
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:15,224
I wouldn't have missed finding
it for ten club dances.

351
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,188
As tired as a horse.

352
00:23:51,622 --> 00:23:52,879
But it was worth it.

353
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,401
A case like that puts fire into a man.

354
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,838
It seems to go out before you get home.

355
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,438
What you need is a change.
Something to occupy your mind.

356
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,809
How would you like to nurse this case?

357
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,327
Hmm? And work together as we used to.

358
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,117
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

359
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:26,335
I'm never going back
to it, George. Never.

360
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:28,179
Not for a moment.

361
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:31,400
I came out here to be a wife.

362
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,580
Not a nurse.

363
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:11,753
How flushed your face is.
- It must be excitement.

364
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:14,096
Excitement?
- Who wouldn't be excited?

365
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,130
Another dinner at the Gymkhana Club
with the same old Nikko to take me.

366
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,856
And the same fussy old
people to dance with.

367
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,659
I think I'll create a
diversion and go like this.

368
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,581
Rene!

369
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,078
Ouch!

370
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,760
It's a bore and you know it.

371
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,627
You are too young to be bored.

372
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:32,896
Married people aren't the
only ones to suffer that way.

373
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,000
And you're much too young to be cynical.

374
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:35,883
Huh.

375
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,884
What are you grinning at?

376
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,589
I was just thinking how
frightfully funny it would be ..

377
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,807
If you didn't really
care for George at all.

378
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:46,758
If secretly you thought he had
turned out to be an awful sinker.

379
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:49,049
Sinker?
- Yes, you know. Blob.

380
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:54,295
It might be funny if we didn't have to
spend the rest of our lives together.

381
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:58,642
I imagine you're the kind who would take
a marriage contract awfully seriously.

382
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,006
I suppose George is
alright as husbands go.

383
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,476
But if I were married, I'd want
my husband with me always.

384
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:08,089
You rarely see him unless
you go to the hospital ..

385
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:11,073
And sit in that smelly waiting
room full of native patients.

386
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:13,130
Nope. I'm sorry.

387
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:16,642
George is my brother but he
is not my type for a husband.

388
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,646
Rene March, what have you been reading?

389
00:26:19,014 --> 00:26:20,173
You would be surprised.

390
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:21,083
Phil.

391
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:23,954
There is your sweet Papa now.
- He mustn't come in here.

392
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,453
Rene. Where is everybody?

393
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,417
In here.
- But you can't come in.

394
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:32,485
It's about these place-cards
for Rene's birthday dinner.

395
00:26:32,795 --> 00:26:34,657
He pokes his fingers into everything.

396
00:26:35,032 --> 00:26:36,452
George is a doctor, my dear.

397
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,821
Rene, do you hear me?

398
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:40,341
Get into your dress before
he pokes himself into here.

399
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:43,360
What is it, George?

400
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:45,193
Well, is this some joke?

401
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,836
What are you talking about?
- These place-cards.

402
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:49,376
Dawltry's name is among them.

403
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:50,809
You mean Hugh Dawltry?

404
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,442
Well there can't be more than
one Dawltry in Khota, I hope.

405
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,683
Didn't you make these out?

406
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,046
Why ..

407
00:26:57,642 --> 00:26:58,600
Of course but ..

408
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:00,215
You can't be serious about it?

409
00:27:00,664 --> 00:27:03,297
But from the fuss you are making
it must be terribly serious.

410
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:05,913
I think it's going to be thrilling.

411
00:27:06,113 --> 00:27:09,304
You don't mean to say that you sent him
an invitation to your birthday dinner?

412
00:27:10,491 --> 00:27:11,530
Why shouldn't we?

413
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,441
Now please, Phil. You haven't been here
long enough to know about Dawltry.

414
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:17,446
But I can't understand such
an oversight on Rene's part.

415
00:27:17,877 --> 00:27:19,084
Surely she has heard.

416
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,253
But Rene didn't send
out all the invitations.

417
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:22,567
I helped her.

418
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:25,398
You sent it?
- I'm quite sure I did.

419
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:27,523
He's our next-door neighbour.

420
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:29,637
But he's strictly taboo.

421
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,960
You forget Phil's still a stranger here.

422
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:33,955
She hasn't even met the gentleman.

423
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:36,947
And she's not going to be placed
in a position where she has to.

424
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:39,542
But he's probably the most
interesting man in town.

425
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:43,230
They say Doris Drayton
followed him all over the orient.

426
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:45,932
After she left her husband.
- You're not going to meet him either.

427
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:48,388
Stop growling, you old bear.

428
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:50,163
Who wants to meet him anyway?

429
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,390
What is that awful smell?

430
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:56,253
Huh? Oh, antiseptic.

431
00:27:56,686 --> 00:27:58,102
A new case of malaria broke out.

432
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:00,557
What is it?

433
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:03,163
Memsahib is here, Memsahib.

434
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,038
Here is Nikki. I must run.

435
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:09,630
I hope Dawltry gets gloriously drunk and
makes love to every woman in the place.

436
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:11,072
Including me.

437
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:12,138
Rene!

438
00:28:13,383 --> 00:28:15,670
Now look here, Phil.
Something has to be done.

439
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:18,733
Why worry about something
that can't be undone?

440
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:19,813
It's Rene.

441
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:21,610
She's just at the impressionable age.

442
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:25,738
And I suppose this notorious Dawltry
person is just at the dangerous age?

443
00:28:26,056 --> 00:28:28,858
You don't understand Phil,
or you wouldn't try to shield her.

444
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:30,150
Shield Rene?

445
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:33,184
You don't suppose I believe for a
moment that you sent that invitation?

446
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,675
Of course I did.

447
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,923
But if the poor man knows how
hospitable you feel about him ..

448
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:41,946
He probably won't accept anyway.

449
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:43,343
No.

450
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,730
Perhaps you are right.

451
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,553
Perhaps you had better dress
for dinner before it's too late.

452
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:52,768
Suppose he does come?

453
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,977
But I thought we just
decided he wouldn't.

454
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:58,485
Yes. Alright.

455
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,789
Now, let me see.

456
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:07,731
Telephone, Dr March.

457
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,486
The hospital, I suppose.

458
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:13,198
It was the Duke's brother.

459
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:15,384
But you are wrong, old Eddie.
It was his cousin.

460
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:17,934
But, my dear fellow.
I assure you it was the Duke's brother.

461
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:21,839
You can take it here, Dr March.
It's the hospital.

462
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,324
Get me a whisky and soda.

463
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:24,653
Very mild.

464
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:27,375
Yes?

465
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:28,873
Dr March speaking.

466
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,131
Yes. Yes. I'm listening.

467
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,256
I'm sure I detect whisky in that.

468
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,618
Oh, Miss Wey-Smith.

469
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:58,191
Just a little bit to the right.

470
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:03,436
I shall still be in the picture?

471
00:30:03,874 --> 00:30:04,920
Of course.

472
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,413
Good heavens.

473
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,538
What is it?
- Dawltry.

474
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:23,707
With the usual liquid cargo aboard.

475
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:25,886
It will sink him one of these days.

476
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,694
Mr Dawltry, isn't it?

477
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:38,886
Good evening.

478
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,225
Miss March.

479
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:43,492
You're ultra-fashionable,
aren't you, Mr Dawltry.

480
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:45,773
Not too late to wish you
a happy birthday I hope.

481
00:30:46,015 --> 00:30:48,093
We had .. we had about given you up.

482
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:49,848
I can hardly blame you.

483
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,609
Everyone in Khota has done that.

484
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:52,905
Quiet, please.

485
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:55,500
Oh.

486
00:30:56,363 --> 00:30:58,233
Well I am holding up a picture.

487
00:30:58,758 --> 00:30:59,516
So sorry.

488
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:00,895
Look at me please.

489
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,351
Everybody smile.

490
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,997
Now very still.

491
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:07,281
One.

492
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:08,363
Two.

493
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:09,486
Three.

494
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:10,696
Four.

495
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,766
Five.

496
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,521
That's very good.

497
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:16,586
Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

498
00:31:19,602 --> 00:31:21,319
The first dance and it's a tango.

499
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:23,033
Don't you love it, Mr Dawltry?

500
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,803
Come on Rene old dear. My dance.

501
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:37,932
Shall we dance this?

502
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:39,868
Well.

503
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:41,564
Really, I ..

504
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,222
You must smash that plate.

505
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:44,663
I am afraid.

506
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:45,898
Of what?

507
00:32:06,378 --> 00:32:07,871
But nobody moved, sir.

508
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,063
It's too bad you missed the picture.

509
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:18,171
Yes. The hospital, you know.
- Yes, you doctors.

510
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,785
You're such busy creatures.

511
00:32:23,063 --> 00:32:24,214
Shall we dance?

512
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,362
I'd be delighted, Mrs Wey-Smith.
But I don't tango.

513
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:29,218
I will teach you, George.

514
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:30,815
It's quite simple.

515
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:41,588
Come, I'll show you the new step.
This is the new one.

516
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,446
And this is what gets exciting.

517
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:54,306
You rather dance it as a
straight tango. Then we go ..

518
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,766
You are bored, aren't you.

519
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:07,560
On the contrary.

520
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:08,798
Have a cigarette?

521
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,467
Your brand on that side.

522
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,194
No thanks.

523
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:14,591
There won't be time.

524
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:16,835
You.

525
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,275
Enjoy Khota society then?

526
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:21,265
I thought you might for a change.

527
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,601
Am I living down to my repudiation?

528
00:33:26,892 --> 00:33:28,501
I never believe all I hear.

529
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,392
So you invited me here to find out, huh?

530
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:34,778
I doubt if you're half as
bad as they see you are.

531
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,039
Oh yes?

532
00:33:38,322 --> 00:33:40,635
In my bungalow you had
me at a disadvantage.

533
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,031
You were unprotected then.

534
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:44,577
And now that I am married?

535
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:52,997
Please.

536
00:33:54,885 --> 00:33:57,180
I thought I wouldn't
entirely disappoint you.

537
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,063
Since I am here on parade.

538
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,579
You.

539
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:03,632
You think that?

540
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:06,938
Is there any other reason that would
make you invite me here as your guest?

541
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:11,241
No.

542
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:13,310
No.

543
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:15,524
No. You were right in the first place.

544
00:34:15,724 --> 00:34:17,117
Phil .. where are you?

545
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,795
Here I am, George.

546
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:25,728
Are you in the habit of dancing
with ladies that you've never met?

547
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,762
Only when the lady is my hostess.

548
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:30,864
Oh, Sorry, Dawltry.

549
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:33,132
This is my wife. Mrs March.

550
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,030
It's a pleasure.

551
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:37,215
Now that we really know each other ..

552
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:39,843
Come along, Phil.
- Goodnight, Mr Dawltry.

553
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,702
I hope you won't think me rude.

554
00:34:41,902 --> 00:34:44,760
Tearing myself away like this without
even one dance with your sister.

555
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:46,463
I hope you'll excuse me, George.

556
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:49,605
I would never excuse you if
you did dance with my sister.

557
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:55,431
Well, in that event I can go home
with a perfectly clear conscience.

558
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:59,362
Oh, Mr Dawltry.

559
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:03,079
So that is where you've been hiding.

560
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:05,841
We all wondered what had become of you.

561
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:07,953
I would hardly call it
hiding, Mrs Wey-Smith.

562
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:08,932
I should.

563
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,275
With such divine music.

564
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:14,883
Do you tango, Mr Dawltry?

565
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:16,700
No.
- I know you do.

566
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:20,162
After having just seen
you with our hostess.

567
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,632
Come with me and I will show you ..

568
00:35:40,077 --> 00:35:42,603
I could dance like this forever.

569
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:43,917
With you.

570
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,133
My husband is so jealous.

571
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,208
Oh yes, I can understand that.

572
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:51,711
George, I have ..
- What is it?

573
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:53,524
I have my new shoes on.

574
00:35:53,842 --> 00:35:54,485
What?

575
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:55,921
Did I step all over them?

576
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,726
Well, there may be one
tiny spot you've missed.

577
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:00,179
Well, let's chuck it.

578
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:01,726
No, George.

579
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:06,172
No. I insist on finishing it.

580
00:36:08,398 --> 00:36:10,562
Doctor March says I'm like a feather.

581
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,684
I am so light on my feet.

582
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:14,495
Who's feet?

583
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:26,531
Will that be all, Sahib?

584
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,209
Yes. Goodnight, Khan.

585
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:31,526
Did you open another bottle
of brandy and leave some ice?

586
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,575
Yes, I have. And your bed
also is very cool now.

587
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,941
No use trying to sleep
with those drums going.

588
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:44,966
What is that?

589
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,194
A funeral or a wedding?
- No, Sahib.

590
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,894
It's a love feast to the Goddess Kronos.

591
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,913
All our young men
take brides at this time.

592
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:56,346
It lasts one, two ..

593
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,030
Three, four days.

594
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,082
Long enough for most marriages.

595
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:02,782
Yes, Sahib.

596
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:57,448
I've got to get up.

597
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:59,103
I've got a lot to do today.

598
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:06,345
Phil?

599
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,492
You're up so early.

600
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:18,419
Phil.

601
00:39:32,932 --> 00:39:33,689
Rene.

602
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,624
What on earth do you want?

603
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:39,910
Have you seen Phil?
- She went out riding.

604
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:42,892
She said she couldn't sleep all night.
Needed some fresh air.

605
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:45,919
Why didn't she tell me?
- She told me to tell you.

606
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:48,985
I can't understand Phil
these last few weeks.

607
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:53,010
She acts as though
she's contracting a fever.

608
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,835
Mrs Wey-Smith says it's ..

609
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,328
The heat.

610
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,560
Well, that's cooled me off a bit.
- Cooled you off?

611
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:08,996
I said a bit.

612
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,743
The only thing that will cool
me off is a drink at the bar.

613
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,286
I'll have a Stinger with you too.
- Alright.

614
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:23,913
Wey-Smith.

615
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,491
Everard.

616
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:30,275
Duckworth.

617
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:32,848
Some new game?

618
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:33,862
No.

619
00:40:34,983 --> 00:40:36,502
Just killing off a few pests.

620
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:41,953
Here.

621
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:45,016
March.

622
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:46,733
What?

623
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:49,664
I beg your pardon.

624
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:51,504
Granted.

625
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:53,443
Have a drink.

626
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:55,744
I've better things to do than
to hang around drinking.

627
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,559
Until then, doctor .. your health.

628
00:40:58,295 --> 00:41:00,059
I preserve mine with plenty of brandy.

629
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:02,425
Brandy and ..

630
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:04,035
Early morning rides.

631
00:41:04,473 --> 00:41:06,633
Nothing like horseback
riding to pep you up, George.

632
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,584
It gives you a new lease on life.

633
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,014
You should follow my example.

634
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:17,316
Is that you, Phil?

635
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:19,916
Hello George.

636
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:20,760
Rene.

637
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:22,568
Where have you been?

638
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:25,104
Just riding.

639
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,589
What are you doing here?

640
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:33,227
Waiting for Phil. We are going
to have luncheon together.

641
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:36,105
The club is no place
for a young girl alone.

642
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:39,338
How cross you are. Where do
you want me to wait, in the pool?

643
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,947
Not in here at any rate.

644
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,118
Under the circumstances.

645
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:51,451
Thought I forgot something.

646
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,579
The telephone, Miss March.

647
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:57,663
Hurry it up, will you?
I'll wait at the car.

648
00:41:57,863 --> 00:42:00,115
But I have my horse.
- Alright. Hurry up and get right home.

649
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,464
Alright, Hello?

650
00:42:02,115 --> 00:42:03,139
Hello, Nikko.

651
00:42:03,347 --> 00:42:05,444
No, I haven't forgotten. Goodbye.

652
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,086
Where did you ride this morning?

653
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,486
I didn't see you.

654
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,113
Lonely men take lonely paths.

655
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:28,681
Do you always ride alone?

656
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:32,314
Sometimes the horse goes with me.

657
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,492
Silly.

658
00:42:35,104 --> 00:42:36,324
I love riding.

659
00:42:36,872 --> 00:42:37,563
But ..

660
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:41,081
Why does everyone start
out at the crack of dawn?

661
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,947
You know what they say
about the early-bird.

662
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:46,443
I suppose the lazy ones
only catch the heat.

663
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:49,214
And a scolding from their big
brothers for going out in it.

664
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:51,572
George isn't my keeper.

665
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,412
I belong to no-one but myself.

666
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:57,020
The safest possible companionship
for very young ladies.

667
00:42:58,507 --> 00:42:59,828
But it isn't much fun.

668
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:01,661
Belonging to oneself.

669
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,818
Don't you try to vamp me young woman.

670
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:07,153
I could, easily.

671
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,253
Well.

672
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:13,093
If this keeps on I shall either have to
turn you over my knee or run for home.

673
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:15,113
In the first place, I'd scream.

674
00:43:15,352 --> 00:43:17,197
In the second, I'd run after you.

675
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,096
I've been dying to see
your bungalow anyway.

676
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:21,920
You wouldn't like it.

677
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:23,749
Orgies. Terrible goings on.

678
00:43:24,178 --> 00:43:25,605
I wouldn't be a bit frightened.

679
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,879
Even of being alone with you.

680
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:30,583
In my bungalow?
- Uhuh.

681
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,092
Wouldn't it be thrilling?

682
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,757
I think there is something wonderful
about a secret shared by two people.

683
00:43:36,092 --> 00:43:38,595
It certainly gives the rest of the
community something to talk about.

684
00:43:39,636 --> 00:43:41,208
Must you treat me like a child?

685
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:42,447
I hope not.

686
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:45,028
Because I don't want
to have to spank you.

687
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:47,547
Whoo, what a fierce ogre.

688
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,334
Well, I really am.

689
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:52,376
But I don't spend my leisure
eating up baby sisters.

690
00:43:53,117 --> 00:43:54,046
You little mug.

691
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:57,592
Oh you, you're the most annoying person.

692
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,655
Suppose your brother walked in here?

693
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,802
And heard you call the notorious
Hugh Dawltry by his first name?

694
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:05,038
But he won't. He's going away.

695
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:08,470
George is?
- Yes.

696
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,936
He sails this evening to take a special
patient to the hospital in Colombo.

697
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:15,160
Well.

698
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,827
I'll have to send him some
flowers to wish him Bon Voyage.

699
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:21,086
A nice basket of fruit.

700
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:22,924
What kind does George like best?

701
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:24,783
I wish you would forget George.

702
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,456
I intend to.
- So do I.

703
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,764
And also stay out as late
as I wish while he's gone.

704
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,426
You'll find that a rather boring
privilege with no place to go.

705
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:40,934
Oh yeah?

706
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:45,549
No, you are wrong.
- I'm right.

707
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:48,041
It was in the spring of 1864.

708
00:44:49,348 --> 00:44:50,197
65.

709
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,586
64.

710
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:53,527
65.

711
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:12,403
Nice to hear that piano again.
- Hello George.

712
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:13,704
You look much better.

713
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:15,880
I was afraid you were
coming down with a fever.

714
00:45:16,117 --> 00:45:18,013
But not with those sparkling eyes.

715
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:21,726
You look quite your old self today.
- Do I, George?

716
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,702
It's nice to hear you say that.

717
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:26,374
You know, I'm worried about Rene.

718
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:29,076
You always have to
worry about something.

719
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:30,482
You lunch with her?

720
00:45:30,786 --> 00:45:33,576
Why, no. I haven't seen Rene
since early this morning.

721
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:35,009
Then she lied to me.

722
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:36,782
About what?
- About everything.

723
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:38,701
Do you know what she did this morning?

724
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:40,661
She's been riding with Dawltry.

725
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,924
But that is impossible. I ..
- Why is it impossible?

726
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:44,053
Well ..

727
00:45:44,606 --> 00:45:46,300
Well, I mean it is absurd.

728
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:47,830
Rene is just a child.

729
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,909
She's eighteen.
That's a woman in the tropics.

730
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:50,914
George.

731
00:45:51,114 --> 00:45:54,732
The heat is bad enough on married women.
But on young girls it is dynamite.

732
00:45:55,518 --> 00:45:57,515
It makes them man-crazy.
- Really, George.

733
00:45:57,715 --> 00:46:00,561
I know what I'm talking about.
It's a pathological fact.

734
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:03,985
Has it another long name or do
you just call it a heatwave?

735
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,037
Now please, Phil.
This is no laughing matter.

736
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:09,270
And it means danger with
men like Dawltry around.

737
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,178
Really George, you are precious.

738
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:12,690
I'm not wrong though.

739
00:46:13,495 --> 00:46:17,163
You tell Rene to pack her bags because
I'm taking her to Colombo with me.

740
00:46:19,537 --> 00:46:21,745
And by the way. I forgot to tell you.

741
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:23,967
Our weekend trip to
the mountains is off.

742
00:46:24,245 --> 00:46:26,181
Business before pleasure, my dear.

743
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:30,251
Then you are going to Colombo instead?

744
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:33,566
I see.

745
00:46:35,284 --> 00:46:36,728
And you are taking Rene with you?

746
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:39,332
Yes. So I can keep my eye on her.

747
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:53,202
For me?
- Yes, Memsahib.

748
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:05,650
Was that Rene?

749
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:07,666
No. Just the mail.

750
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:09,602
For me, isn't it?

751
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:11,458
No, George.

752
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,187
George.

753
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:41,707
What is it?

754
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:43,717
I wish you'd come and help me pack.

755
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:46,157
I can't find a thing.
- Alright, George. But ..

756
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:51,163
Do you think taking Rene
with you is exactly wise?

757
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:53,282
You know, I'll be here alone.

758
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:55,371
Better alone than with
her on your hands.

759
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:57,412
She is too much of a responsibility.

760
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:59,665
I'm not going to ask
you to play detective.

761
00:48:03,877 --> 00:48:07,387
Where are my socks and my
clean shirts? I can't find a one.

762
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:11,077
Are you coming, Phil?
- Yes, George. I'm coming.

763
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:46,048
Well.

764
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:49,184
See? I did find a place to go after all.

765
00:48:49,405 --> 00:48:50,735
Rather childish I should say.

766
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,085
I'm old enough to know that
when a man like you ..

767
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:58,912
Says 'no' to a woman,
he really means 'yes'.

768
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,095
And besides, I like your style.

769
00:49:03,763 --> 00:49:04,621
So I see.

770
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:08,775
And I like your bungalow.

771
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:12,071
But I couldn't find an orgy any place.

772
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:13,637
Now that's nice.

773
00:49:14,047 --> 00:49:15,594
Now that you have seen everything.

774
00:49:15,814 --> 00:49:17,179
Oh, but I haven't.

775
00:49:17,551 --> 00:49:19,085
Not everything.

776
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:22,001
What's in here?

777
00:49:22,856 --> 00:49:24,273
That is where I sleep.
- Ooh.

778
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:25,822
How thrilling.

779
00:49:26,203 --> 00:49:27,944
I've never found sleep so thrilling.

780
00:49:29,277 --> 00:49:30,658
Except in Khota.

781
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:34,564
I don't believe you're half as
bored as you always pretend.

782
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:35,585
No?

783
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:37,874
Just careful.

784
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:40,709
I am.

785
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:42,444
Very careful.

786
00:49:43,141 --> 00:49:45,215
No, shall I call you a rickshaw
or will you walk home?

787
00:49:45,446 --> 00:49:47,374
But I'm not ready to go home yet.

788
00:49:48,772 --> 00:49:51,036
Now I know how you
fascinate all the women.

789
00:49:52,404 --> 00:49:56,077
You make them think you don't want
them When you really do all the time.

790
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:57,351
Or ..

791
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,151
Are you afraid of me?

792
00:50:04,145 --> 00:50:05,663
Oh, Mr Dawltry.

793
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,419
Oh, where are we going?

794
00:50:07,692 --> 00:50:08,907
What are you going to do?

795
00:50:10,018 --> 00:50:11,697
You mustn't take me there.

796
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,301
Where else, my sweet?

797
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,611
Let me go. I'll scream. Let me go!

798
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:17,226
Let me go, let me go.

799
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:19,583
I'll scream, let me go. Let me go.

800
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:27,102
Well, for a woman with
experience in such matters.

801
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:28,663
I am disappointed.

802
00:50:30,048 --> 00:50:31,330
I think I am too.

803
00:50:32,016 --> 00:50:32,787
Well.

804
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,163
Good afternoon, Mr Dawltry.

805
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:36,838
I had a nice time.

806
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,179
So, my suspicions were right.

807
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:48,792
This is where you've been.

808
00:50:49,537 --> 00:50:52,613
But I haven't. Really.
I just dropped by from the club.

809
00:50:52,976 --> 00:50:55,597
You've not been at the club for hours.
I looked for you every place.

810
00:50:56,202 --> 00:50:56,833
Hmm.

811
00:50:58,317 --> 00:50:59,145
Well.

812
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:02,006
I hope we haven't made
an old maid of her.

813
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:07,138
But ..

814
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,098
What were you doing
in Dawltry's bungalow?

815
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:10,415
Nothing.

816
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:11,989
That is, I ..

817
00:51:12,254 --> 00:51:13,821
I came to borrow a phonograph record.

818
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:19,836
You go home and pack because you
are coming with me to Colombo.

819
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,115
Now, hurry.

820
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:22,417
Yes, George.

821
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:31,441
Well.

822
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:39,685
Been waiting long?

823
00:51:40,337 --> 00:51:41,066
Dawltry.

824
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,342
My sister was just here.
- You don't tell me.

825
00:51:44,616 --> 00:51:46,176
Well, now I am sorry I wasn't home.

826
00:51:46,468 --> 00:51:47,775
Lucky for you, you weren't.

827
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:49,728
Unlucky, I should say.

828
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,763
This has gone far enough, Dawltry.

829
00:51:51,963 --> 00:51:54,795
I'll tell Rene the next time I see her.
- There will be no next time.

830
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,905
And if I ever see you
even talking to her ..

831
00:51:58,105 --> 00:51:59,692
You are going to have another patient.

832
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:01,561
If you don't stop your talk about me.

833
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:06,531
That is if you are contortionist enough
to patch your own rather boring face.

834
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:08,684
Now get out.

835
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,642
And stay out of my affairs
until they concern you.

836
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,376
If they ever do, Dawltry.

837
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:16,200
I'm coming back here with a gun.

838
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,115
Rene, can't you hurry?

839
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:31,291
We have plenty of time.
- But my patient is aboard.

840
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:57,680
She is there, doctor March.

841
00:52:58,061 --> 00:52:59,648
I'll ask the Captain to hold the boat.

842
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:03,696
What on earth is the matter now?

843
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:05,313
The patient died.

844
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:07,811
And we're not sailing?

845
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:10,172
There is no use now.

846
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,320
But you couldn't help it, dear.

847
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:16,348
Every doctor must lose some patients.
- You don't understand, Rene.

848
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:19,172
This one had sacrococcygeal tumour.

849
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:22,041
I would have been photographed with it.

850
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:25,571
All the medical journals would
have mentioned my name.

851
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:27,135
Come, George.

852
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:31,090
Perhaps you'll find another disease with
a much longer name, right here at home.

853
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:46,157
Angry?

854
00:53:46,931 --> 00:53:48,159
I should be, shouldn't I?

855
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,719
Ah, but she's such
a kissable little girl.

856
00:53:51,741 --> 00:53:53,468
You know I think you are rather nice.

857
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:56,393
Almost too nice for all the
things they say about you.

858
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,595
Do you know what I think?

859
00:54:00,459 --> 00:54:01,476
No. Tell me.

860
00:54:04,938 --> 00:54:05,667
Shall I?

861
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:13,870
Well.

862
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:15,259
Perhaps not.

863
00:54:16,031 --> 00:54:16,739
Now.

864
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,144
Those drums.

865
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,005
They've been going incessantly
for the past two nights.

866
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:33,794
It is a native feast to Kronos.

867
00:54:35,136 --> 00:54:36,466
She is their goddess of love.

868
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:38,678
Some hideous idol, I suppose.

869
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,111
No. This goddess was rather human.

870
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:44,994
A virtuous lady who sneaked
off to earth for one night.

871
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:47,183
To taste sin.

872
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,825
Was she forgiven?

873
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,317
She found love.

874
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,216
For only one night?

875
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:01,339
That's where she ceased to be human.

876
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:06,460
And what happened to this
very modern goddess of love?

877
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:09,006
After her one night.

878
00:55:11,372 --> 00:55:12,845
She went back to her spirit world.

879
00:55:13,797 --> 00:55:15,327
A childish sort of legend, isn't it.

880
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:17,224
Yes.

881
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,694
No woman could go back after that.

882
00:55:24,544 --> 00:55:25,357
Philippa.

883
00:55:25,746 --> 00:55:26,439
Hugh.

884
00:55:30,689 --> 00:55:32,834
Oh please, Hugh.
- Philippa.

885
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:34,880
Do you love me?
- Yes, I am afraid I do.

886
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:36,092
And I love you.

887
00:55:36,824 --> 00:55:37,953
Do you?
- Believe me.

888
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:40,147
Oh, I want to believe you.

889
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,847
Even though I shouldn't.

890
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,064
You mean ..

891
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:49,698
My dear.

892
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:53,500
Sometimes, even reputations
have false faces.

893
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:01,952
Wasn't Doris Drayton a
misunderstood wife also?

894
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:04,363
Not only misunderstood.

895
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,130
But misguided.

896
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,706
By her trust in a certain man?

897
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,898
By her appraisal of that
man's feelings for her.

898
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,434
Surely you weren't one of those
innocent correspondents?

899
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:20,354
Not from any virtuous
inclination on my part.

900
00:56:21,806 --> 00:56:24,626
I simply never wanted Doris Drayton.
Not even for a moment.

901
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:26,795
But she spent the night
in your bungalow.

902
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,973
The third night of her honeymoon.

903
00:56:29,728 --> 00:56:31,415
On the strength of her own convictions.

904
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:33,523
And I suppose your strength of will ..

905
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:36,846
Was not enough to convince the
newspapers and the court differently.

906
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:38,402
In the face of appearances.

907
00:56:39,453 --> 00:56:40,328
Besides.

908
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:42,610
Doris didn't want vindication.

909
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:44,404
She wanted a divorce.

910
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:46,929
I was only her tool to get it.

911
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:53,008
And after that night, what happened?

912
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,335
Well her father and I
went on a glorious jag.

913
00:56:57,304 --> 00:56:59,239
Her father?
- Finished up in China.

914
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:01,374
There weren't two drunker
men in the orient.

915
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:02,961
A bit maudlin, wasn't it.

916
00:57:04,403 --> 00:57:06,240
You call that .. maudlin?

917
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:07,809
Don't you?

918
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:12,031
I think it's the nicest ending
to a story I ever heard.

919
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:21,370
There could be a much
nicer ending to ours.

920
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:26,910
A boat sails tomorrow at dawn.

921
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:29,206
For Singapore and the Far East.

922
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:32,102
I'm going to let you write
the last chapter of ours.

923
00:57:32,862 --> 00:57:34,112
If it ends without one.

924
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:36,295
I will understand.

925
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,689
I wonder where Phil is.

926
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:01,300
In bed probably at this hour.
And that's where you go, young lady.

927
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:04,299
Goodnight, you crosspatch.
- Goodnight.

928
00:58:06,093 --> 00:58:07,341
And don't wake Phil.

929
00:58:45,307 --> 00:58:46,392
Well, where is Phil?

930
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:49,143
Probably at the club.

931
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:51,261
Where else could she be in this town?

932
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:09,990
Do you suppose I should call the club?

933
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,272
What's that you have there?

934
00:59:14,154 --> 00:59:14,994
Nothing.

935
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,664
Will you please go to bed and
stop worrying about Phil and me.

936
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:18,822
That's a letter.

937
00:59:19,113 --> 00:59:19,842
What is?

938
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:21,851
That piece of paper you hide.
- George ..

939
00:59:22,051 --> 00:59:23,552
And it's from that rotter, Dawltry.

940
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:25,257
I see it all now.

941
00:59:25,606 --> 00:59:28,150
You had a date with him. That's why
you didn't want to go to Colombo.

942
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:29,817
Don't be silly.
- Let me see it.

943
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:31,404
Let me see it.
- George, stop.

944
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:33,706
Don't take it from me.
- Give it to me. Let me have it.

945
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:47,834
It's all a mistake.
I'm sure it is, George.

946
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:49,558
Please. Please don't go.

947
00:59:49,867 --> 00:59:50,805
It's not true.

948
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:53,973
Now this doesn't concern you at all.
This is entirely my business.

949
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:55,404
Please, George.

950
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:56,948
It's between me and my wife.

951
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:25,280
Philippa.

952
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:28,682
Do you notice how differently
those drums sound?

953
01:00:29,553 --> 01:00:31,510
There's a certain music
in them, isn't there.

954
01:00:34,174 --> 01:00:35,469
Philippa.
- Yes, dear?

955
01:00:36,743 --> 01:00:37,872
I want to talk to you.

956
01:00:38,238 --> 01:00:39,298
Please, not now.

957
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,818
Much wiser now than later.

958
01:00:42,627 --> 01:00:44,243
Are you afraid I'll be sorry?

959
01:00:47,427 --> 01:00:48,373
Yes, I am.

960
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:51,614
Like all the others.
- Don't, dear.

961
01:00:52,646 --> 01:00:54,039
I want to forget all that.

962
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,726
But you don't want to be forgotten.

963
01:00:58,183 --> 01:00:59,055
As they were.

964
01:00:59,373 --> 01:01:01,042
But you couldn't if you loved me.

965
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:02,386
I do now.

966
01:01:03,608 --> 01:01:06,141
But there's always a chance that
it won't last with a man like me.

967
01:01:07,387 --> 01:01:09,666
I've never known anything
deeper than a conquest.

968
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:12,672
This has suddenly turned
out to be something else.

969
01:01:12,981 --> 01:01:15,494
But if we love each other,
what else is there?

970
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:17,086
For you, nothing.

971
01:01:17,557 --> 01:01:19,151
But dear ..
- Philippa.

972
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:21,978
I lied to you about Doris Drayton.

973
01:01:23,094 --> 01:01:24,636
I really did break up a home.

974
01:01:25,241 --> 01:01:26,399
I thought I wanted her.

975
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,671
Then found I didn't.

976
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,012
I'm not going to leave another
Doris Drayton behind me.

977
01:01:31,382 --> 01:01:33,062
Now you are just being heroic.

978
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:35,146
And I don't want you to be.

979
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,278
She furnished the
heroics the other time.

980
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:39,411
Took her lover so seriously.

981
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,942
His departure left the door
open to many lovers.

982
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:43,868
As her only consolation.

983
01:01:44,713 --> 01:01:46,588
She wasn't the kind who
could go back either.

984
01:01:46,817 --> 01:01:47,938
I'm not afraid.

985
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:51,129
If a woman can't hold a
man it's her own fault.

986
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:52,887
But the risk is there.

987
01:01:53,727 --> 01:01:54,914
I won't let you take it.

988
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,845
It's not much of a risk for happiness.

989
01:01:59,013 --> 01:02:02,106
Do you think I am going to give it
up because of a noble gesture?

990
01:02:10,053 --> 01:02:10,912
George.

991
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:16,729
That door leads to the hall.

992
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:18,895
You can go out the back
way without being seen.

993
01:02:19,095 --> 01:02:20,083
I'm not leaving.

994
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,825
You can't let him find you here.

995
01:02:22,025 --> 01:02:23,737
That's just what I am going to do.

996
01:02:24,022 --> 01:02:25,679
Philippa, think what this means to you.

997
01:02:27,383 --> 01:02:29,245
This isn't the time or
the place for heroics.

998
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:31,363
That is just what I said a moment ago.

999
01:02:33,406 --> 01:02:36,489
I'm not going to let you make
any more noble gestures for me.

1000
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:48,510
Dawltry, open this door and let me in.

1001
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:52,062
Why, George ..

1002
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,664
This is a surprise.

1003
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:54,935
It is meant to be.

1004
01:02:55,674 --> 01:02:56,753
Where is my wife?

1005
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:58,990
How should I know?

1006
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:00,185
Don't lie to me.

1007
01:03:01,964 --> 01:03:03,263
I know Phil is here.

1008
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:04,512
Oh.

1009
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:07,131
Well, unfortunately she didn't
accept that invitation.

1010
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:10,942
None of your family will allow me
to repay your gracious hospitality.

1011
01:03:11,326 --> 01:03:12,661
I feel very badly about it.

1012
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,539
Someone dined here.

1013
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:16,075
Yes.

1014
01:03:16,732 --> 01:03:18,233
The identity of my dinner guests ..

1015
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:20,012
Is hardly any of your business.

1016
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:23,187
When the guest is my wife
it becomes my business.

1017
01:03:25,894 --> 01:03:27,052
She's here someplace.

1018
01:03:27,966 --> 01:03:30,029
You are right. As usual, George.

1019
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:34,342
What are you doing here?

1020
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:38,709
If I answer you truthfully it will force
me to a very embarrassing admission.

1021
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,620
This is no time for evasions.

1022
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:42,839
Neither is it the time to
ask awkward questions.

1023
01:03:43,105 --> 01:03:44,206
I'm in earnest, Phil.

1024
01:03:44,464 --> 01:03:45,580
In dead earnest.

1025
01:03:46,147 --> 01:03:47,562
I also was in earnest.

1026
01:03:48,785 --> 01:03:49,890
But Mr Dawltry.

1027
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:51,238
Refused me.

1028
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,909
Refused you?
I don't understand what you mean.

1029
01:03:55,258 --> 01:03:57,501
You couldn't, with the opinion
you have of Hugh Dawltry.

1030
01:03:57,796 --> 01:04:00,182
You are just trying to shield him.
- Must you make a scene?

1031
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:01,536
Not with you.

1032
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,177
We will have ours at home, I suppose.

1033
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:05,809
As usual.

1034
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,083
No, Phil. There's going to
be no scandal in my house.

1035
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,845
But Dawltry is leaving Khota for good.

1036
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,168
And so am I, George.

1037
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:14,143
And I am also leaving you.

1038
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,197
I came out here in search
of love and happiness.

1039
01:04:20,006 --> 01:04:21,523
I found instead a machine.

1040
01:04:22,469 --> 01:04:24,940
A machine of cold steel.

1041
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:27,466
As cold as the instruments you use ..

1042
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:31,253
To probe into the bodies of unconscious
patients on operating tables.

1043
01:04:34,028 --> 01:04:36,349
Nursing hasn't changed me from a woman.

1044
01:04:37,024 --> 01:04:38,297
But surgery in the tropics.

1045
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:40,667
Have changed the man I came to marry.

1046
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:45,180
So I turn to Hugh Dawltry for the love
and affection you didn't give me.

1047
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:48,658
If I didn't know that you
were suffering from a ..

1048
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:50,981
Pathological complaint
common to the tropics ..

1049
01:04:51,332 --> 01:04:52,776
I should think you were neurotic.

1050
01:04:53,404 --> 01:04:54,950
It's just a physical heatwave.

1051
01:04:56,303 --> 01:04:58,555
And that cad took advantage of it.

1052
01:04:58,762 --> 01:05:00,289
Not of me, George. You did that.

1053
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,522
All you wanted was a wife.
Any woman would have done as well.

1054
01:05:03,785 --> 01:05:06,466
And some other woman can
take my place from now on.

1055
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:11,080
I was going away with Hugh Dawltry.

1056
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:15,127
But he refused to put me in
the position of Doris Drayton.

1057
01:05:16,266 --> 01:05:18,139
He said he loved me too much.

1058
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,263
You swine.

1059
01:05:21,695 --> 01:05:24,968
Perhaps my heroics
were a mistake after all.

1060
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:31,616
Men have such different and
peculiar definitions of love.

1061
01:05:32,773 --> 01:05:35,079
To a woman, there can
be only one meaning.

1062
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,354
To be loved.

1063
01:05:39,253 --> 01:05:40,276
Goodbye, George.

1064
01:05:42,587 --> 01:05:44,031
But you can't leave me like this.

1065
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:45,880
You will get over it.

1066
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,600
You may even find another
sacrococcygeal tumour to comfort you.

1067
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:52,418
Who knows?

1068
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:53,818
What will people say?

1069
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,550
My name? My reputation.

1070
01:05:56,154 --> 01:05:58,823
I am taking the boat that
leaves at dawn for Singapore.

1071
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:02,950
And nothing you can
say or do will stop me.

1072
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:08,127
Philippa.

1073
01:06:38,443 --> 01:06:39,237
Dawltry.

1074
01:06:39,598 --> 01:06:41,657
A moment ago I said
you were leaving Khota.

1075
01:06:42,174 --> 01:06:44,191
You decided to get rid
of me at last. It that it?

1076
01:06:44,765 --> 01:06:46,786
For good, Dawltry. And I meant it.

1077
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:48,198
I am glad you did.

1078
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:50,796
Because that fits in
with my plans exactly.

1079
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:54,197
But you may be going to quite a
different place than you anticipated.

1080
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:55,202
Yes?

1081
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:56,265
Yes.

1082
01:06:56,745 --> 01:06:58,732
I'm going to kill you, Dawltry.

1083
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:01,888
When they know the truth
they'll all cheer me for it.

1084
01:07:03,215 --> 01:07:04,354
Before you do ..

1085
01:07:04,742 --> 01:07:05,929
Do you mind if I finish?

1086
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,565
I have a horror of an
undertaker dressing me.

1087
01:07:10,218 --> 01:07:12,321
I've never known one yet
who can tie a bow correctly.

1088
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:14,984
I'm not Sam Drayton. You can't
make me the laughing stock of Khota.

1089
01:07:15,184 --> 01:07:16,708
And then brazen your way out of it.

1090
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,329
The laugh is really on me, George.

1091
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:23,834
For the first time in my life.
I've made a fool of myself over a woman.

1092
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:26,972
Because I thought she was
making a fool of herself over me.

1093
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:29,871
But even an attempt
at fidelity on my part.

1094
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:32,777
Would be better than letting a
wonderful woman like Philippa.

1095
01:07:33,272 --> 01:07:35,488
Shrivel up and rot in this
hole like the rest of you.

1096
01:07:37,132 --> 01:07:39,366
So, I've decided to take
your wife away from you.

1097
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:43,848
If you are going to shoot me, George.

1098
01:07:44,629 --> 01:07:45,817
Now is your last chance.

1099
01:07:48,091 --> 01:07:49,893
Because I am leaving
to take that same boat.

1100
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:51,447
For Singapore.

1101
01:08:08,075 --> 01:08:09,176
I'm sorry old fellow.

1102
01:08:09,456 --> 01:08:11,387
But you will have to find
a new partner in crime.

1103
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:12,717
From now on.

1104
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,281
I'm a one-play man.

1105
01:08:17,615 --> 01:08:18,374
Cheerio.

1106
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:39,318
..r-o..
