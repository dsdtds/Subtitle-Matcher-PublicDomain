1
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,544
War. Total war. A struggle for
survival.

2
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:39,831
In this era of force and
destruction...

3
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:44,380
historians will argue. What was
the most influential factor.

4
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:48,690
What was the most deadly
instrument? The most deadly weapon?

5
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:54,691
Was it the overwhelming manpower?
Was it the blistering fire of the rockets?

6
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:03,973
Was it the thundering mail from
heaven? The bombs, the blockbusters?

7
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:14,954
Was it the lightening descention of
the parachute?

8
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:20,573
Was it the whithering stutter of the
light machine-gun?

9
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:26,374
Or the spectacle from the
commanding troops?

10
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,719
Or the pattended tanks?

11
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,920
Was it the flame-thrower?

12
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:40,721
Or was it the screaming anger of faster
than sound, quicker than this: the B-2 rocket?

13
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,024
No! It was none of these things.
The most effective, the most deadly...

14
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:50,021
The most terrifying weapon of all
time was.

15
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:55,222
Yes, you're right. The sergeant's
whistle.

16
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,256
All right you guys, now I'm gonna
tell you something.

17
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:03,257
The adjutant is coming, see? And
as usual the Colonel ain't very happy.

18
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:09,842
And I ain't very happy either. Look
at this joint. It looks like Coney Island on a Monday morning.

19
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:12,366
- Hi Serg, what's the action?
- Have you seen Corwin?

20
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:16,527
Yeah, I seen him, but I couldn't take
him so I sent him over to the mess hall. He's on KP.

21
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:19,611
- Okay, take them away.
- Right Serg.

22
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:28,412
All right my friends. I want you to fall
out, spread out, and pick up everything that ain't growing or nailed down.

23
00:03:57,373 --> 00:04:00,235
Let's go. Give us some food.
Come on, come on!

24
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:01,867
Come on, let's have it.

25
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:04,602
- What are they gripping about?
- Well, they've got to eat them.

26
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:08,203
Well, I've got to cook them.

27
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,499
Let's get out of here, it the
Sergeant.

28
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:19,270
- What do you think you're cooking
around here? - Beans?

29
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:24,535
Oh shut up! You've been getting
away with murder, and it's got to stop. Understand? Shut up!

30
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:27,988
Just because we were friends
before and used to work together, I've been covering up for you.

31
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,050
That's gotta stop too. Do you
understand? Shut up!

32
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:36,305
Now get your pack and everything
that goes with it. I want to see you down front in 5 minutes. Understand?

33
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:37,794
Shut up!

34
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:41,199
You're going to go on a long, long
journey and you may not be back this way. Understand?

35
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Shut up!

36
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,738
Get to packing, everything goes
with it, be down there in 5 minutes. SHUT UP!

37
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,419
Going on a long, long trip, might not
be there when you're finished. SHUT UP!

38
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,020
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

39
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,309
It'll go under AR 605/300..

40
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,609
before the CO can get it un 104 and
107.

41
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,170
Now the record goes on WVA 20
and 24.

42
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,424
He could be eligible for a 615/360.

43
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,913
Section 7, paragraph 49.

44
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:17,114
Oh sure, I get it.

45
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:28,877
Sure and an MR19-2 and the profile
is 24.4.4.4D.

46
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:32,215
Oh boy, I ain't in the army, I'm back
in the numbers racket.

47
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,004
Here's the mail Corporal.

48
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:37,837
Well, guess I'll take another crack at
that bandit. Do you think it will work?

49
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:40,435
Should. There was a guy in here a
while ago who fixed it.

50
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,436
Bout time.

51
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,404
How do you like that? Now you
don't even get the nickel back.

52
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:59,405
Crazy army. I asked for a transfer
again and they throw me right out of Italian headquarters.

53
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:03,914
Shawnessy, how many times do I
have to tell you that this ain't a day room.

54
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,220
- Got a cigarette?
- Yeah, here.

55
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:08,922
- Tell Sergeant McWell I want to see
him right away. - Right!

56
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,523
- Is Miller in?
- Yeah.

57
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:17,878
Hey Miller, what do you think we've
got here, midgets?

58
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,384
Captain, what about this training
film here tomorrow morning?

59
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:28,378
Oh yes... that begins at 7 o'clock.

60
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:32,548
The theater is 2 blocks away so I
think we'd better fall out at 6:35.

61
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,686
They'll want us in front of ltalian
headquarters.

62
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,385
Not later than 6:25.

63
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:39,549
In that case Davenport, have the
men lined up and ready to go

64
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,950
at... 6:15.

65
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,229
Serg, that guy is lost again.

66
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,430
Well, you'd better find him.
- Right Serg.

67
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:51,502
Hey, you see them lights? You see
that sign?

68
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:53,890
Let's be turning them off.

69
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:56,572
Sergeant McWeel, we've got to see
the work, don't we?

70
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:02,086
Well, what if Colonel Davis comes?
He don't like lights on in the daytime.

71
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:05,230
Another thing McWell, the company
has an early formation tomorrow and

72
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:09,167
you'd better have those men fall out
at 5 minutes before 6.

73
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,162
- 5 minutes before 6 huh?
- Yeah.

74
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:16,363
I tell you, I've got some names here
that are cock-a-may-mes.

75
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:21,328
Rodowsky. .. Smellywesh...
Keselioshmiasch.

76
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:24,528
Why don't we pull them out early,
say 5:45 huh?

77
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,129
- Okay.
- Right Serg.

78
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,475
Some day this guy is going to blow
his brains out.

79
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:36,076
If you ask me, he's already done it.

80
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,015
Yes sir. Yes Captain.

81
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:13,016
Yes sir!

82
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:45,946
See the first Sergeant in the other
room.

83
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:57,716
Go around the outside. Through
that door.

84
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,493
That door.

85
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,965
I said that door.

86
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:05,741
Got a cigarette? No, I quit.
- Can't afford it.

87
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,418
There you are. Where've you
been?

88
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,470
Fine looking specimen you are.
Get over there. Look at you! Look at this!

89
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:23,969
Fix the helmet. Now get out on
the parade grounds. Ten times round. Double time. Understand?

90
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,970
Then come back here. I've got
plans for you.

91
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,468
Go on, get the lead out of your
bucket.

92
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:35,269
Wait a minute. Come here.

93
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:38,565
Got a cigarette?

94
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:55,680
- I've been arguing with him again.
- Oh yeah?

95
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:59,118
I don't dig this army at all. I want
overseas...

96
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:02,718
.I stay here. The guys that want
to stay here, get overseas.

97
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:06,198
- You forget, there's a war on.
- Yeah, but what do we get to do about it?

98
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,657
When I was a civilan, we had
something going every minute. Singing, dancing, working in nightclubs.

99
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,946
I join the army, I sit on my hands.

100
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:18,747
I'm hungry. Think I'll inspect the
mess hall.

101
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:24,010
- Hi ya Serg. Been waiting up for me?
- How come you're late Edwards?

102
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:28,309
I was drunk. I don't blame you.
With a kisser like that, I'd be loaded all the time.

103
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,170
- Thank-you. - You're welcome, now
go to your barracks Edwards, get into your fatigues and report back here.

104
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:38,371
And if you have any social
engagements, call your secretary and have her cancel them.

105
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:44,771
Sergeant's real brave today.

106
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:48,172
I get any mail?

107
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:51,240
Sure took you a long time to sober up.

108
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,414
took me a long time to get drunk.

109
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:56,218
My new girl had a date with another
Joe last night.

110
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:59,819
What's the matter, losing your
appeal?

111
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,342
Does that look like I'm losing my appeal?

112
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:06,743
Wow! Very tasty.

113
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,832
Hello.

114
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,527
Hello.

115
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:22,430
- Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?
- No, he's out.

116
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,328
What did you want to see him
about?

117
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:28,033
It's of a rather personal nature.

118
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:32,865
- Would you like to leave a
message. - Yes, just tell him Nelly was here.

119
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,008
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

120
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:40,670
On second thought, do you mind if I
sit here and wait for a while.

121
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:44,871
- Oh no, go right ahead.
- Thanks.

122
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:49,519
Clark, do you have that field...

123
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,520
manual?

124
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,769
I want four copies of this Clark, it is
to go to the ad agent.

125
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,060
- But sir, I did this yesterday.
- Oh you did?

126
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,861
Yes sir.

127
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,488
So you did. Well, I want one more
copy.

128
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:25,557
Yes, sir.

129
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:30,927
You know, it takes a fantastic amound
of paperwork to administer even a little tank company, such as we have here.

130
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:33,189
Are you ready Ernie?

131
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,295
Not yet dear. I'll be right with you.

132
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:40,296
I've decided we can do without
another copy of this.

133
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:47,853
- That's our commanding officer.
- Which one?

134
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,155
Who in the company is that girl
married to?

135
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:54,607
I don't know dear. Shall we call the
detectives?

136
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,902
Now darling, don't get testy.

137
00:17:56,903 --> 00:18:02,080
just happen to know that she's the
tidiess little girl, she works on the post, she had calcium deficiency, and...

138
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,868
she's expecting.

139
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:07,040
- Expecting?
- Yes, and don't ask me what she's expecting.

140
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,571
Where in the world did you uncover
all of this, Mrs. Shelock Holmes?

141
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,047
At the clinic yesterday.

142
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:16,318
I was there for my cold shot and
one of the nurses told me about her.

143
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,288
Say, I just remembered, there's
been a mix-up in the OD roster.

144
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:23,603
- I know.
- I may get it.

145
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:27,036
No you won't. Lt. Tourrey is stuck
as officer of the day.

146
00:18:27,037 --> 00:18:28,983
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

147
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:33,864
Sally Pearson told me, that the
adjutant's wife told her, that the adjutant said so at noon.

148
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:37,865
Oh well, if Sally said so, that settles it.

149
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:45,453
How are you getting along with
Colonel Davis?

150
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:49,415
Well, that depends. How are you
getting along with Mrs. Davis?

151
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:53,491
That woman! She's so rank-
conscience.

152
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,149
How soon will you be ready to leave?

153
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,396
Why don't you go to the club and
wait. I have a lot of papers to sign.

154
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:03,051
- Can't someone else sign those?
- I'm the only one.

155
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:06,149
The United States Army has high
regard for my signature.

156
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,550
I wish The First National Bank did.

157
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,849
Where'd you get these clothes
Sergeant?

158
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,650
- Quarter master sir.
- Why didn't you get a shipping ticket when you got the clothes?

159
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:33,144
I don't know sir. Maybe they
weren't paying attention when I drew the issue?

160
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:37,476
Then this is stolen goods.

161
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,469
No sir.

162
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,154
I think I'll have to have a look at
army regulations.

163
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:43,235
But Lt. Davenport, don't you trust me?

164
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:47,436
This is no way to run a business.
Carry on.

165
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,809
He's going to tell me how to run a
business.

166
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,513
He used to be a soda-jerk. He just
ran out of soda.

167
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:07,936
- I got to see the First Sergeant.
- Hi ya kid. I see you're still wearing your old hat.

168
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,766
You leave me alone. I got troubles.

169
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,914
In the army? You got troubles?

170
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:14,612
Yeah, and I gotta see the First
Sergeant right away! It's important.

171
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,814
Take it easy...

172
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,748
Don't tell me how to take it. I got to
get a three-day pass.

173
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:22,048
Last guy in the army that got a
three-day pass, was Sergeant York.

174
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,745
Yeah, well I don't care. I got to see
my wife. It's an emergency.

175
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:27,816
I've had emergencies, but could I
get a pass?

176
00:20:27,817 --> 00:20:29,622
Bet you were never having a baby.

177
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:33,279
Kid, I've never even
had my appendics out.

178
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,743
- Corwin!
- Yes sir.

179
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,764
- Did you do those penalty tours?
- Yes Corporal.

180
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,526
- Did you report to the drill
Sergeant? - Yes Corporal.

181
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,264
- Did you report to the mess
Sergeant? - Yes Corporal.

182
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:43,589
Okay.

183
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,444
Boy, if I ever get overseas, the first
thing I'm gonna do is surrender.

184
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,445
Concentration camps have got to
be better than this.

185
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:54,671
What crumby coffee. Why I
wouldn't wash my...

186
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,511
Hey! It's here, the shipping order.

187
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:59,020
- Came while you were out.
- Now watch me get out of this hole.

188
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:01,018
- Hey Serg, I wanna...
- What do you want?

189
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:06,019
- Nothing. I just thought that maybe I...
- Get out of my way. Can't you see I'm busy?

190
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:09,712
Captain Caldwell, I've just seen the
shipping orders and I have just the man for you sir.

191
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:10,733
Good. Who is he?

192
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:13,168
Me! First Sergeant Victor
Puccinelli.

193
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,925
Don't be foolish Sergeant.

194
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:19,394
This call is only for Privates and
PFC's. You'd better make up your mind, you're staying here.

195
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:22,491
- I've seen...
- I won't argue that point.

196
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:27,409
Now, about this shipment. We can't
be expected to cripple ourselves, so...

197
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,211
. don't send anyone who is useful.

198
00:21:29,212 --> 00:21:31,612
How about that kid that never
doesn anything right?

199
00:21:31,613 --> 00:21:33,885
- You mean Corwin?
- That's the one.

200
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:35,734
He's right out here now sir.

201
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:39,303
Maybe Eisenhower can do
something with him.

202
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:41,191
Yes sir.

203
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:44,152
Corwin!

204
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:46,777
- I want to see you.
- I've been wanting to see you too Vic.

205
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:47,574
I wanted to know if...

206
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:50,238
Get you hands off my desk and call
me Sergeant.

207
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:53,311
- Can't you stand up?
- Yes Sergeant.

208
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,950
I just wanted to know if I could get a
three-day pass.

209
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:59,263
What'd you say?

210
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:00,657
I want to know if I can get a three-
day pass?

211
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:03,104
Did you get permission from your
platoon Sergeant to come in here?

212
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,005
No, Sergeant, but I...

213
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:07,402
How many times must I tell you that
in the army you must go through channels.

214
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:11,864
Yeah, but this is an emergency and if I go
through the section leader and the platoon sergeant and you and everbody else,

215
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:16,289
my kid will be old enough to be
drafted himself.

216
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,930
Very funny.

217
00:22:17,931 --> 00:22:20,490
I can't be giving you a three-day
pass every week.

218
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:21,869
You just came off one.

219
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,140
That's not true. I haven't been on
one in a long time.

220
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:26,964
And if my wife forgets what I look
like, you'll be responsible.

221
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:31,135
You should get that lucky. We'll see
about it when the time comes.

222
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,206
- You heard me.
- Yes Sergeant.

223
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:37,407
- Aren't we going to rehearse our
act for the show? - Oh get going.

224
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,509
Wait a minute. Come here.

225
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,542
How come you didn't shave today?

226
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:45,818
I didn't know I was suppose to. I didn't
shave yesterday and nobody said nothing.

227
00:22:45,819 --> 00:22:49,019
Get out of here.

228
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,927
You didn't always used to treat me
like this.

229
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:53,332
Oh stop mumbling.

230
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,603
you didn't always used to treat me
like this, that's what I said, so there so.

231
00:22:56,604 --> 00:22:58,682
- Are you going to start that again?
- Yes, I am.

232
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:02,642
You're suppose to be my friend.
We lived on the same block, in the same city.

233
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:04,476
And you know what you promised
my mother.

234
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:07,022
Stop hitting my desk. And what did
I promise your mother?

235
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,832
That no one would harm a hair on
my head.

236
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,812
You mean both heads.

237
00:23:09,813 --> 00:23:11,646
Ho, ho! That's rich!

238
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:14,655
Oh quiet pea-head. Just cause we
were friends before...

239
00:23:14,656 --> 00:23:16,119
Friends before is right.

240
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,724
Anything to do with now.

241
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:19,677
I have a responsibility and you're
part of it.

242
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,465
I'm warning you, you're driving me
crazy.

243
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,523
That's no drive, that's a short putt.

244
00:23:24,524 --> 00:23:26,107
Ah what do you want? Special
privileges?

245
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:30,005
No, I just want to remember you as the best
man at my wedding. You're not kidding.

246
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:33,692
We were buddies, and we wrote
songs, and we dansed and we sang together.

247
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:36,491
And you still owe me 8 dollars and
75 cents, since before the war.

248
00:23:36,492 --> 00:23:39,270
And we was friends and family. We
was just like brother and sister.

249
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:43,733
And what happens? Along comes a
crumby little war and clip-clap, you turn into a Dr. Jerkyll and Mr. Clyde.

250
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:45,186
What is it with you anyhow?

251
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:49,621
- Okay. .. okay. ..
- Okay. .. okay. .. Big man!

252
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:52,296
Couple of stinking stripes. Big deal!

253
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,923
- Go home and wash your face.
- Go home and wash your face.

254
00:23:55,924 --> 00:24:00,033
Big deal. Look at him, General
Delivery.

255
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:03,234
Get out of here.

256
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,341
What's the matter with Einstein?

257
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:07,348
He thinks I bombed Pearl Harbour.

258
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:10,292
When Edwards comes back, tell
him he's being shipped out.

259
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:13,713
- Say, there was a Nelly here
looking for you. - Millie?

260
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:16,464
Wonder what she wants? Oh,
what's the date?

261
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:19,684
- The 29th.
- That's it! Tomorrow is the anniversary of our first alert.

262
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:22,032
Alert? This office has never been
alerted.

263
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:24,690
I know it. I just used it as a gag.

264
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,133
You know the first time I saw Nelly,
she looked real good to me.

265
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,416
- But all I got was ice-cubes.
- So?

266
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,741
- So I told her we were being
alerted. - So?

267
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:34,370
So she let me kiss her.

268
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:35,537
So?

269
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:38,102
- So, I took her out a few more
times. - So?

270
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:41,577
- So, she let me kiss her a few more
times. - What's wrong with that?

271
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:45,802
Nothing, expect one day she
started to talk and I found out how dumb she was.

272
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:48,785
You know that dame is really 60
cents short.

273
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:51,613
Not only that. She got on a getting-
married kick.

274
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:54,193
What is it with these dames? They
all want to get married?

275
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,184
I know a lot of nice people that
aren't married.

276
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:59,585
Then one night I took her out...

277
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,406
Yes sir! Yes sir! Right sir!

278
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:09,727
After you tell Edwards he's being
shipped out, send him into Miller..

279
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:12,728
to have his supply record checked
out. Right.

280
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:34,334
Hello! You're that cute Corporal that
was here when I came before, aren't you?

281
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:37,406
Yes, but the Sergeant still isn't in.

282
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:42,349
I don't suppose you know if he's going
to stay in camp tonight or tomorrow night?

283
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,772
- No you see, we never know when
we're going to be alerted. - I know.

284
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:50,458
Ours is not the reason why. Ours is
to do or die.

285
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,170
That's cute.

286
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:55,452
Look, why don't you write him a
note.

287
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:59,561
Write him? Well, you do it.

288
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:04,842
Just say: I'll be back at 6:45 when I
get off from work.

289
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:07,985
And put down it's important.

290
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:12,547
And if I don't see him, there might
be trouble.

291
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:17,917
Okay. If I see him. You know, he's
not the easiest guy in the world to locate.

292
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:19,830
Don't I know it.

293
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:26,231
Well, I have to get back to the PX.
We're terribly busy today, we're closed.

294
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:29,732
Closed for inventory.

295
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:32,933
Good-bye.

296
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,304
Well, they did it again.

297
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:38,495
The adjutant just stuck me with
Officer of the Day.

298
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,936
- I know.
- You know?

299
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:44,604
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- My wife just told me.

300
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,581
Did she also mention when the war
would be over?

301
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:51,182
She doesn't tell me everything she
knows.

302
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:59,376
- Clark?
- It's okay. She's gone.

303
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:00,910
What Millie have to say?

304
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:04,570
She left you a note. She said she'd
be back 6:45.

305
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,055
Come in.

306
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:07,269
No.

307
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,789
- But Sergeant!
- Have you got permission to come in here?

308
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,425
- No.
- Well get out.

309
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:16,825
They think all I have to do around
here is hand out passes. Now, what was I talking about?

310
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:20,211
Nelly. She said if she doesn't see
you tonight, there's going to be trouble.

311
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:22,709
I'd better catch the first bus into town.

312
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,510
- Hey Corporal. Would you know where I can...
- Hey! Douse them lights. The Colonel's coming.

313
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:33,024
The offices too.

314
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:39,455
Hey! Oh, I'm sorry sir, but the
Colonel is coming and you know how he feels about lights burning in the daytime.

315
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:43,456
- And you know how I feel about it.
- Yes, I do sir.

316
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:53,827
- All clear.
- Okay, turn them on.

317
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:55,240
Hey, where's Corwin?

318
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:59,808
He's been running in and out of
here all day long, and if it keeps up, we're going to have to put in a revolving door.

319
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:01,778
Does he got permission to skip training?

320
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,960
No and you'd better find him and
we'll send him to the CO.

321
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:04,864
Right Serg!

322
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:08,622
And another thing. Edwards and
these guys are shipping overseas.

323
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:09,493
Come in.

324
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:11,240
Come in.

325
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:16,241
- Get out of here.
- Come back.

326
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:19,661
You need to be explaining why you
haven't been in no classes this afternoon.

327
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:22,478
- I've been looking all over for you Mc Vie.
- Oh, you've been looking for me huh?

328
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,517
Yeah, can I have permission to see
the first Sergeant?

329
00:28:24,518 --> 00:28:25,518
No!

330
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,458
- But I gotta see him.
- You don't gotta see nobody!

331
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:31,357
I've got a message for the first
Sergeant from battalion headquarters.

332
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:33,327
- Why didn't you say so?
- He didn't let me.

333
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:34,892
Corwin, will you never learn?

334
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:40,493
You know, before you take off on
detail, you gotta tell your platoon Sergeant.

335
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:45,902
All right! What's the message?

336
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:50,253
It says you gotta report to the dispensory
in the morning for a physical examination.

337
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,289
Physical! Let me see that.

338
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,370
My application went through.

339
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,714
Serg, you need me for anything?

340
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:59,315
No, take two weeks off.

341
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:03,975
Wait a minute Serg. Form 38 is
filled out in case of discharge.

342
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,641
- Discharge? What does that mean?
- Oh he's right Sergeant.

343
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:13,287
According to paragraph 8, article
40-100, 24 hours prior to discharge of an enlisted man,

344
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:19,489
for reasons other than disability, he
must be examined and form 38 filled out.

345
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,638
They can't do this to me.

346
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,931
- Sergeant!
- What?

347
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:24,722
When you get home, will you call
my mother?

348
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,400
Get out of here.

349
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:30,472
I'll refuse. I'll go in and tap his head
with a 4x4.

350
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:36,037
Captain Corwin, can you tell me
about this? They want to discharge me.

351
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:40,038
- Now Serg.
- Go ahead and read it for yourself.

352
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:43,080
Sergeant Goosenelly. Nelly will be...

353
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,081
No, no, no

354
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:55,456
WDA... Form 30...

355
00:29:55,457 --> 00:30:00,469
Oh calm yourself Sergeant. Your applicatioin
for warrant-officer has come through.

356
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,413
You're being discharged to accept
the appointment as warrant-officer.

357
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:06,268
Me an officer? Well, that's worse.

358
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,726
- Sergeant.
- Yes sir?

359
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:11,727
Will you make out tomorrow's
morning report and send it to battalion.

360
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,795
Morning report tonight?

361
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:17,796
Yes, from now on, they want it in
the night before.

362
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,960
- It's a discharge, so I can become a
warrant-officer. - Congratulations!

363
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:27,819
Hey what's this deal about me
shipping out?

364
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,825
It's no deal. You're just on a movement.
You'll be leaving in a couple of days.

365
00:30:30,826 --> 00:30:34,359
Look Serg. How about crossing my
name off that list?

366
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,694
You know, I've got a new girl in town
and we're pretty serious.

367
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:39,157
- That's very touching.
- Listen, I've got to see my girl.

368
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:41,928
I've seen the girls you go with.
You'll do better where you are going.

369
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:44,278
Yeah? Well, I've seen your type too.

370
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,836
Well, why don't you drop down to
Realdo theater sometime?

371
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,509
- Renaldo?
- Yeah, the new red-headed usher.

372
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,159
- Helen?
- Yeah, that's right.

373
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,139
Well I'm a dirty, low-down, no-
good...

374
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,532
You win that argument. Go ahead,
start another one.

375
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,462
You're cutting in on me. I go with
Helen.

376
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:59,791
- You went with Helen.
- Now I see why I'm on shipment.

377
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,412
You're pulling your rank on me.

378
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:06,213
Don't do it Serg. 96 article of war.
Sock him and the Captain will bust you.

379
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:10,088
Put this on the bulletin board.

380
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:17,620
Sgt. Puccinilli, Millie will be here at
6:45. There may be a problem.

381
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:22,095
You can take off wise guy and start
packing. I've got work to do.

382
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:24,454
- This ain't no poolroom.
- No?

383
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:29,055
- I could have sworn I just saw an eightball.
- Get out of here.

384
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,498
- And what do you think you're doing?
- I'm singing.

385
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,284
You call that singing?

386
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:09,488
- Didn't you like it a little?
- I didn't even like it a lot.

387
00:32:09,489 --> 00:32:11,564
You have to admit, my voice is
different.

388
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:13,433
Come on Serg, let's hear you sing it.

389
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:16,705
I can't. I've got some work to do
and besides, I've got a date in town.

390
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:18,958
Come on Sergeant!

391
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,959
Okay. One chord.

392
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:29,443
All right boys. Let's get going.
Come on.

393
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:37,514
- How long before Miller gets here?
- About 20 minutes.

394
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:41,364
I'd like to find the joker that spread
the rumor around that I'm already a warrant-officer.

395
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:41,965
Why?

396
00:34:41,966 --> 00:34:46,866
Every time I walk into the barracks
some nitwick shout Attention!

397
00:34:55,778 --> 00:34:59,337
Okay you lucky people. You can
get ready and go to town now. I'm ready to take over.

398
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:01,772
Take that junk into the Captain's
office.

399
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:02,972
And take that with you!

400
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:06,573
Hey Corwin, give me a hand will
you?

401
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:12,172
Well I guess that wraps things up
Clark. Go on, get home to the little woman.

402
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:14,172
Thanks Serg! See you in the
morning.

403
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:19,973
I'll be back in a minute. Hey Corwin.
Don't forget you have to polish up outside too.

404
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:24,872
Hey Shawnessay. Some dame
might drop in here asking for me, so tell her I'm out running the obstacle course.

405
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,773
Okay.

406
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:34,172
You know Shawnessay, I kind of
wish Mc Vie would cut this throat.

407
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,172
How could he blow his whistle?

408
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:40,772
You know, some people say when
you get in the army, you get used to it.

409
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:43,972
But they don't say how long it takes,
and I ain't getting any younger.

410
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:47,973
- You know something Corwin?
- Hey Corporal!

411
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:55,334
I guess I'll get me a couple of
beers...

412
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:59,135
- So, going to wet your whistle eh?
- You bet.

413
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:04,173
Come on, let's be hurrying.

414
00:36:08,096 --> 00:36:11,496
Hey, there's something you missed.

415
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:16,074
Let's be getting on the ball.

416
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:17,703
Yeah, but nobody can see up there
Sergeant.

417
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:20,553
That don't make no difference!

418
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,354
It's awful sloppy around here.

419
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:27,352
You gotta be neat.

420
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,852
You gotta be tidy.

421
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:34,253
Cause if we ain't, somebody's
gonna get it.

422
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:38,830
This army ain't just a place to have
fun you know.

423
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:43,511
Well, if anybody asks for me, I'm
painting the town.

424
00:36:43,512 --> 00:36:49,112
And when I'm painting the town..

425
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,349
..I'm painting the town.

426
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,550
Big man.

427
00:36:57,964 --> 00:37:01,364
Gotta be neat.

428
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:04,957
Gotta be tidy.

429
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:12,025
Here's something you missed.

430
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,423
Let's be getting on the ball.

431
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:16,838
Yeah, but Sergeant, nobody can
see tthat.

432
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,439
That don't make no difference!

433
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:28,178
If anybody asks for me, I'll be out
painting the town.

434
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,760
And when I paint the town...

435
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:35,945
I'm painting the town.

436
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:37,514
Take it easy son.

437
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:41,297
Why does that Mc Vie have to be in
the army? Why couldn't he be in the navy?

438
00:37:41,298 --> 00:37:43,180
I can't sleep in the afternoon on
account of that guy.

439
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:45,373
Why don't you take a poke at him?

440
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:47,034
Me take a poke at Sergeant Mc Vie?

441
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:47,514
You know what they'd do to me?

442
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,839
What can they do to you? There's
nothing lower than what you are now.

443
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,135
Look, in the regualtions, it says that
you can challenge anybody in the army.

444
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:58,016
If you think they're taking advantage of
you, ask them to put the gloves on with you.

445
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:00,693
You mean I could sock Sergeant
Mc Vie in the nose and nobody would say nothing?

446
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:02,757
Suuuure.

447
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,373
- What if he hit me first?
- But you don't let him.

448
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:09,374
You see it's a matter of science lad.
Come here, I'll show you.

449
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:13,485
Strike a pose.

450
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:16,489
See first you gotta take a style.

451
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,504
John L. Sullivan.

452
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,766
No, that's not for you.

453
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:25,167
Wait a minute. The Jack Dempsey
crouch.

454
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:27,727
That's better. You're a killer!

455
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:32,328
Get low! Lower, lower.

456
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:38,695
Hey I got it. Come here.

457
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:42,280
Toni Cassaneri. That's it.

458
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:45,681
He was a ballet dancer.

459
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:06,563
Oh no. Look, you gotta have
rhythm. Watch.

460
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:31,899
Corwin. Come here.

461
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,920
- What are you doing?
- I'm training.

462
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:34,560
For what?

463
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:37,826
- I'm going to put the gloves on with
Sergeant Mc Vie. - Mc Vie?

464
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:38,831
Yeah, I'm going to jab his head off.

465
00:39:38,832 --> 00:39:40,894
Where do you want the body sent?

466
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:43,781
- Send it to Mc Vie's parents.
- Your body!

467
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:47,382
Go on, get in and finish the rest of
your work.

468
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,474
- Vic.
- No!

469
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,277
Can't I just talk to you for a minute?

470
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:57,656
All right. What do you want now?

471
00:39:57,657 --> 00:40:00,440
- Remember that song we wrote together?
- Yeah, what about it?

472
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,803
Well, we got a telegram fromt he
music publisher and he...

473
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:05,273
.. wants us to put the song on a
record and send it to him right away.

474
00:40:05,274 --> 00:40:06,999
Go ahead and make a record of it.

475
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,294
No, I want you should record it.

476
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,898
Get Bing Crosby.

477
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:12,293
I like you better.

478
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:15,299
Oh you don't have to fight Mc Vie.
You're punchy already.

479
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,876
Why? Just cause I like you better?

480
00:40:17,877 --> 00:40:20,892
At least you could do, is show a
little consideration for me.

481
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:23,980
Sure, I know you're a sergeant and
I'm only a private.

482
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:25,797
At least you could do, is be a little
friendly.

483
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,231
All right. I love you, I'm your friend.
What do you want me to do?

484
00:40:28,232 --> 00:40:32,235
If you never ever give me a pass
again, I don't care. Just take this song into town tonight.

485
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:34,565
You know that place where you put
a quarter in the machine...

486
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:38,766
instead of writing home to your
mother, you send your voice on a record.

487
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:45,442
- Here's a quarter.
- But I got a date.

488
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,668
So what? Take your date to the
recording booth with you.

489
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:51,811
Might be a little warm, might be a
little fun.

490
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:53,960
All right. I'll record it.

491
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:57,283
Millie!

492
00:40:57,284 --> 00:41:00,284
I'll be seeing you.

493
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,775
Come in.

494
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:05,276
Oh hello.

495
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:08,667
Hello. Is Sergeant Puccinelli in?

496
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:14,393
- Oh no, he out on a bizzwhack.
- Oh that's a shame. How'd it happen?

497
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:17,217
Say, haven't I seen you someplace
before?

498
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:22,808
You might have seen me at the PX.
Number 10. I used to sell beer.

499
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:25,915
But I asked to be transfered to the
candy counter.

500
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,358
What happened? Did you get
hungry?

501
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,540
- Good-evening Corporal.
- Oh hi.

502
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,642
Aren't you going to introduce us?

503
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:34,988
Private Edwards meet a friend.
Friend, meet Private Edwards.

504
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:36,319
Your name's Millie, isn't it?

505
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,101
Millie doesn't look it, but she just
switched from beer to candy.

506
00:41:39,102 --> 00:41:41,829
Would you like to take your break
now Corporal?

507
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,806
Definetly.

508
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:45,197
Glad to have met you.

509
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:48,852
Oh thank-you. If you want
anything, just ring for the bellboy.

510
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:51,506
He's nice, isn't he?

511
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:57,554
- Do you think Cutie will be here tonight?
- Cutie? Do you mean Puccinelli?`

512
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:59,976
No, I don't think he can make it.

513
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:04,777
But anything you want to tell him,
why you can tell me.

514
00:42:05,535 --> 00:42:10,475
What's your name? The charge of
quarters was so crazy when he introduced us...

515
00:42:10,476 --> 00:42:14,491
..is all that I remember is that you're
a friend of his.

516
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:20,292
U.S. That's cute. Monogrammed
blankets.

517
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:25,759
My name is Caldwell. Private Ernie
Caldwell.

518
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,792
I was just thinking that if you're not
doing anything tomorrow night..

519
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,385
Oh tomorrow night.

520
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:33,503
Hello.

521
00:42:33,504 --> 00:42:36,482
Don't you know enough to knock
before you come into a room?

522
00:42:36,483 --> 00:42:39,978
Gee whis. I was just down at the
PX and I thought that Corporal Shawnessay would like some ice- cream.

523
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:43,579
Set it on the desk. I'll see that he
gets it.

524
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:51,755
The spoon's inside.

525
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:03,347
We'll keep this between the two of us.

526
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:06,948
You don't got to worry about me.
I'm no snitcher.

527
00:43:16,933 --> 00:43:20,333
Got a cigarette?

528
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:40,231
Corporal I've got to get into town
right away. Can I get a pass?

529
00:43:40,232 --> 00:43:41,167
Are you nuts? You're restricted.

530
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,551
But the fellas forgot the music. I've
got to have a pass.

531
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:44,712
Nothing doing.

532
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:45,990
Corporal it's a matter of life and
death.

533
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:49,191
Nothing doing.

534
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:36,156
Can you sing Melancholy Baby?

535
00:45:36,157 --> 00:45:39,276
- No!
- That's okay, I'm glad.

536
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:43,477
I hate that Melancholy Baby.

537
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:06,856
I beg your pardon, did you see..

538
00:46:06,857 --> 00:46:11,257
I beg your pardon. Oh never mind.

539
00:46:13,257 --> 00:46:17,876
Hey Charlie. What was that?

540
00:46:17,877 --> 00:46:20,284
I don't know Serg.

541
00:46:20,285 --> 00:46:23,001
Excuse me..

542
00:46:23,002 --> 00:46:26,443
I beg your pardon.

543
00:46:26,444 --> 00:46:29,844
Did you see what I saw?

544
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,444
Here's a light.

545
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:50,819
What'll you have?

546
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,673
Creme d'cassise.

547
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:57,874
Creme d'cassise?

548
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:29,721
Excuse me little lady. How about a
little drink? Please!

549
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:34,713
- Hey, can you sing Melancholy Baby?
- Bartender!

550
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:36,509
All right Romeo.

551
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,671
I'm just buying a little drink for
Melancholy Baby.

552
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:43,610
You've had enough Serg.

553
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:49,611
I ain't going to stop drinking, until
she starts looking good to me.

554
00:47:56,992 --> 00:48:00,967
You're the first dame I ever met..

555
00:48:00,968 --> 00:48:05,968
.. who didn't remind of any other
dame I ever met.

556
00:48:06,098 --> 00:48:07,980
Bartender, How much
do I owe you?

557
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,181
A half a buck.

558
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:17,674
- Thank-you.
- Thank-you! You've been very nice.

559
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:22,803
- What were you saying?
- How about singing a little song?

560
00:48:22,804 --> 00:48:25,459
A little song for soldier? Would you
like ah...

561
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,770
good-night song? Or a...

562
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:33,073
children's song? Or a

563
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:37,274
.. foolish song?

564
00:48:37,865 --> 00:48:41,065
Oh I'm awfully sorry.

565
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:47,301
- Will you play this please?
- Oh sure.

566
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:56,754
- It's me Alvin.
- Alvin? What on earth are you doing in that outfit? Are you nuts?

567
00:50:56,755 --> 00:50:59,394
- Me nuts?
- You guys ran off and forgot the music.

568
00:50:59,395 --> 00:51:00,386
What if you get caught?

569
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:03,938
Never mind. Get Puc in that
recording booth. We got to have those records the first thing in the morning.

570
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:07,139
He's over there.

571
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,682
- Now as I was saying.
- Yes Vic?

572
00:51:11,683 --> 00:51:17,683
Helen, you look so wonderful
tonight. Could I interest you in a slightly used kiss?

573
00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:19,487
Now what do you guys want?

574
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:21,389
We had to go back to camp. We
forgot the music.

575
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,028
Well don't bother me. Give it to
Sam at the piano.

576
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:27,029
Okay Serg.

577
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,097
- What's the matter Vic?
- Oh nothing. Just one of those things.

578
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:35,487
Come on. What is it?

579
00:51:35,488 --> 00:51:38,403
- I didn't want to tell you...
- But what?

580
00:51:38,404 --> 00:51:41,758
- We're being alerted.
- Alerted?

581
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:43,759
But Vic.

582
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,124
Well what am I going to do when
you're gone?

583
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:48,441
Why Helen, are you going to miss
me that much?

584
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:50,939
Sure Vic.

585
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,275
This might sound a little hokey, but I
wrote a song...

586
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:57,481
.. and I would like to make a record
of it, just for you.

587
00:51:57,482 --> 00:52:00,492
Oh Vic. That's nice.

588
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:02,977
Would you mind stepping into the
booth while I record it?

589
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:06,178
I'd love to.

590
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:48,543
All right Corwin. What are you doing?
Are you going to make this your life's work?

591
00:54:48,544 --> 00:54:52,436
What do you want from me? Why
don't you worry about what you are doing and I'll worry about what I'm doing...

592
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:56,916
I never made this stuff before in my
life. When those guys are ready, I'll give it my all.

593
00:54:56,917 --> 00:55:01,145
Worry about what your doing, I'll
worry about what I'm doing, I've never done anything like this before in my life.

594
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:04,546
Who are you?

595
00:55:12,917 --> 00:55:17,725
Good boy Corwin, good boy. Now
let's got down to the dispensary.t.

596
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:18,784
The what, the where?

597
00:55:18,785 --> 00:55:23,156
The little old dispensary. We're
going to take the little old arm, and we're going to roll up the little old sleeve...

598
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:26,779
then we'll get the little old needle
and give you a little old shot...

599
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,763
and it aint' going to hurt a little old
bit. Come on.

600
00:55:28,764 --> 00:55:32,721
- You sure it ain't going to hurt?
- No it won't hurt you a bit. Come on.

601
00:55:32,722 --> 00:55:35,922
Good boy, go ahead.

602
00:55:36,524 --> 00:55:40,603
Believe me, you won't even feel the little old
needle.

603
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,328
I won't feel the little old needle?

604
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:45,909
- Noooo, won't even hurt you a little bit?
- Won't even hurt me a little bit?

605
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:46,951
Noooo.

606
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:49,354
- Is it a square needle?
- Round needle.

607
00:55:49,355 --> 00:55:52,355
Next.

608
00:56:11,524 --> 00:56:14,524
Corwin!

609
00:56:15,398 --> 00:56:18,598
Now just relax.

610
00:56:19,991 --> 00:56:21,213
Roll up your sleeve.

611
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:24,337
Think of something pleasant.

612
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:25,866
You're eating ice-cream.

613
00:56:25,867 --> 00:56:29,565
You're dancing with a beautiful,
beautiful girl.

614
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:33,966
You're sleeping in a white dreamy bed.

615
00:56:38,575 --> 00:56:41,040
I didn't bet to the last part.

616
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:44,630
Now that didn't hurt a bit, did it?
How do you feel?

617
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:49,431
Feel good? Okay. Come on, let's
go.

618
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:53,872
Corwin!

619
00:56:54,363 --> 00:56:57,363
Come in.

620
00:57:06,374 --> 00:57:09,391
- Does this finish up your maleria shots?
- Yes Corporal.

621
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:13,803
- And me too.
- Here take this note into the mess sergeant.

622
00:57:13,804 --> 00:57:16,404
How do you feel?

623
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:22,012
- You said it wouldn't hurt me.
- You'll live.

624
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:25,213
That's what I'm afraid of.

625
00:57:25,672 --> 00:57:28,303
- Good-morning Corporal.
- Good-morning Captain.

626
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:31,504
As you were.

627
00:57:32,643 --> 00:57:36,847
Puccinelli, I talked to Colonel
Davies and he is going to put you on that overseas movement.

628
00:57:36,848 --> 00:57:38,133
That's swell Captain.

629
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:42,074
Coporal Clark tell you about the
army woman that was in army room yesterday?

630
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:42,784
Yes sir.

631
00:57:42,785 --> 00:57:46,356
She's having trouble locating some
man in the company.

632
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:48,083
And I want you to find the man.

633
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:50,671
Yes sir. I'll try, but it won't be easy.

634
00:57:50,672 --> 00:57:53,401
She could make things nasty, if she
got to the Colonel.

635
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:55,937
- Will you take care of it?
- I'll do my best sir.

636
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:59,444
Good! As soon as you find the
man, I want to see him.

637
00:57:59,445 --> 00:58:02,245
Yes sir.

638
00:58:02,956 --> 00:58:05,988
How do you like that? Now I'm in
charge of domestic relations.

639
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:10,728
Even that little old alert gag I pulled
on Millie just to kiss her a few times...

640
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:14,729
Hey douse them lights. The
Colonel is coming by.

641
00:58:25,226 --> 00:58:30,500
Sarg Puccinelli, I'd like to see your
copy of the master training schedule

642
00:58:30,501 --> 00:58:34,199
It's supposed to be posted
on the bulletin board Yes Sir

643
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,000
Clark, show the Colonel
how we posted the schedule

644
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:46,225
- It's here sir.
- I can't see it.

645
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,138
It's, it's... I'm sure I put it here

646
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:50,767
Well it doesn't seem to be here now.

647
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:54,368
I think it's in the other room Colonel.

648
00:58:55,987 --> 00:58:58,944
- What was that?
- I think it's in the other room.

649
00:58:58,945 --> 00:59:01,745
Colonel.

650
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,884
- Good-morning Colonel.
- Good-morning Caldwell

651
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:26,228
We can't seem to find a copy of that
master training schedule.

652
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,136
It should be posted in every orderly
room.

653
00:59:29,137 --> 00:59:31,626
It's probably there sir.

654
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:36,327
- No it isn't on that board.
- I can't understand why it isn't up.

655
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:44,417
Here it is.

656
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:51,254
I hope it looks better than your
orderly room.

657
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:54,855
Sergeant Puccinelli.

658
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:02,767
Open that door!

659
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:32,892
I hope someday to see a copy of
that master training schedule.

660
01:00:32,893 --> 01:00:36,464
We found it sir. It was posted under SOP.

661
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:40,665
Ah yes. Well no wonder I didn't see
it. It's too dark in here.

662
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:45,152
Turn on those lights.

663
01:00:52,998 --> 01:00:55,998
Here's the envelope from ltalian.

664
01:00:56,065 --> 01:00:58,511
- So you're really going to ship me out?
- That's right.

665
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:02,620
Well "Cutie". I had a nice little talk
last night with Millie and...

666
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:03,472
And?

667
01:01:03,473 --> 01:01:06,418
And I'll give you the rest of the day
to get my name off that list.

668
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:10,619
Don't threaten me. Out!

669
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:12,552
Wait a minute.

670
01:01:12,553 --> 01:01:13,164
It's a pleasure.

671
01:01:13,165 --> 01:01:17,365
Here's a telegram for Corwin. Give
it to him in the messhall.

672
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:18,897
Sergeant Puccinelli.

673
01:01:18,898 --> 01:01:21,395
Colonel Davies is going to inspect
the supply room.

674
01:01:21,396 --> 01:01:25,196
- And following that, the messhall.
- Yes sir.

675
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,897
- Miller!
- Yeah?

676
01:01:27,898 --> 01:01:31,017
- The Colonel is going to inspect in
a minute. - Oh no Serg!

677
01:01:31,018 --> 01:01:33,436
Ditch this for me.

678
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:37,119
Where am I going to hide this? A
long one for Louie.

679
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,770
It's all right. We're part of the
charges.

680
01:01:41,771 --> 01:01:44,266
Captain, what's gotten into this
company?

681
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,331
- Well a few things have gone wrong sir.
- A few things?

682
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:50,732
Captain I have never...

683
01:01:52,468 --> 01:01:55,167
- What was that?
- Sounds like the messhall.

684
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:57,968
Messhall?

685
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,720
- Signal's over.
- What's the meaning of this?

686
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:07,606
Sergeant Puccinelli, what's going
on here?

687
01:02:07,805 --> 01:02:11,157
What's that whistle? Is there a fire?
What is it?

688
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:14,615
It's a baby. Vic look! It's a little
baby!

689
01:02:14,616 --> 01:02:18,022
Look when we first married, we
didn't think we'd have any, then...

690
01:02:18,023 --> 01:02:22,823
we got a little... COLONEL!

691
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:27,363
Colonel said this is the most
outrageous company he's ever seen.

692
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:29,112
He's cancelled you off that shipping
order.

693
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:32,189
- You mean I can't go overseas?
- That's right.

694
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,590
Here it is in writing.

695
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:42,404
I'm sorry sir. Yes sir.

696
01:02:43,484 --> 01:02:45,326
How do you like that?

697
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:49,496
709. Five years in this man's army.
Five years and the day before I go on shipping...

698
01:02:49,497 --> 01:02:52,847
I get caught in this filthy machinary.

699
01:02:52,848 --> 01:02:55,630
What's the first class this
afternoon? Calisthenics.

700
01:02:55,631 --> 01:03:00,731
Of fine, that's all I need. There's got
to be an easier way to make a living.

701
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:10,409
I'm afraid this little number will keep
us busy for a week.

702
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,850
- Oh good-afternoon Mrs. Caldwell.
- Good-afternoon.

703
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:14,921
How soon will you be ready?

704
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:18,442
Well, well, well. All dressed up to
go places, I see.

705
01:03:18,443 --> 01:03:22,527
I'm afraid for once in my life, I have
a surprise for you.

706
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:23,790
Really?

707
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,077
It seems without consulting you..

708
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:31,481
the Colonel has given B-company
officers a special problem which will undoubtly take all night to do.

709
01:03:31,482 --> 01:03:33,561
What kind of problem?

710
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:38,829
We have to identify a number of
South Pacific islands by their topography.

711
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:41,630
- Sally said you wouldn't get that till
tomorrow.

712
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:45,509
Then you must have done
something to anger Sally, because she gave it to us today.

713
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:47,591
Well I'll tell her a thing or two..

714
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:50,992
I might have come out without the
answers.

715
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:53,277
The answers?

716
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:56,478
I've got them right here,
some place.

717
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:01,266
Here you are.

718
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:05,730
Munich, Straussberg, these aren't
the answers.

719
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:08,677
Oh, that's C-company.

720
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,878
Here's yours.

721
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:17,057
Ero, colsoe, Dagora...

722
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:19,717
If I thought there was another
woman like Dorthy on this earth...

723
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:22,993
..I'd tell you to get married at once.

724
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:25,449
I'm certainly glad you appreciate me.

725
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:32,250
Well, I've got a few things to pick up
at the PX. And I'll be back to pick you up in exactly 20 minutes.

726
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:39,818
I'd better give this to Captain
Conner in C-company.

727
01:04:40,256 --> 01:04:43,856
At ease men.

728
01:04:45,342 --> 01:04:52,405
- That Mc Vie. He wants another
good-conduct ribbon. - How does he lose so many?

729
01:04:53,406 --> 01:04:56,755
I don't know. He gets plastered and
deal them out like fraternity pins.

730
01:04:56,756 --> 01:05:01,156
Hey, the Colonel is checking
calisthenics.

731
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:08,159
- I beg your pardon sir.
- Yes, what is it?

732
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,760
Colonel is checking orderly rooms...

733
01:05:24,645 --> 01:05:27,103
- Sergeant Miller on duty sir.
- Where is Segeant Puccinelli?

734
01:05:27,104 --> 01:05:30,493
With the company, taking calisthenics
sir. Shall I get him for you sir?

735
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:32,159
No.

736
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,353
No, the exercise will be good for him.

737
01:05:34,354 --> 01:05:35,355
Yes sir.

738
01:05:35,356 --> 01:05:36,701
- Miller. ..
- Yes sir?

739
01:05:36,702 --> 01:05:41,611
At ease. What's the name of that
Sergeant, the one with the whistle?

740
01:05:41,612 --> 01:05:43,830
Oh you mean Mc Vie sir.

741
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:50,298
I want you to find Mc Vie immediately.
Tell him to get this entire outfit on the obstacle course in 10 minutes. Understand?

742
01:05:50,299 --> 01:05:53,299
Yes sir!

743
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:15,559
Hey Corwin.

744
01:06:43,118 --> 01:06:46,093
Come on let's go. Head's down.

745
01:06:46,094 --> 01:06:51,494
Come on you guys, keep it moving.
I want to hear them helmets. Keep moving.

746
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:14,672
All right, come on. Come out fresh,
keep moving.

747
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:22,850
Hey Corwin, come out. You're beginning
to fall back. Let's get out of there.

748
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,300
All right come on, keep crawling.

749
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:32,840
All right let's go. Stay with it.

750
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:37,841
Come on let's go. You're holding it
up there.

751
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:45,164
Come on Corwin, let's go. You're holding
up the detail. All the guys are waiting.

752
01:07:45,165 --> 01:07:47,596
On this side Corwin, are you crazy?

753
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:50,979
On this side! Stay here now!

754
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,180
Come on, you can do it.

755
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,790
Taken like a bird.

756
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:12,923
Corwin!

757
01:08:12,924 --> 01:08:17,124
- Yes Serg?
- You've got to stop this clowning.

758
01:08:25,659 --> 01:08:29,259
All right you guys, keep it low.

759
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,199
Hey Corwin!

760
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,600
What happened to Corwin?

761
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,921
Hey Corwin!

762
01:09:02,641 --> 01:09:08,041
Okay, let's go. You're holding it up.
Look alive there.

763
01:09:09,815 --> 01:09:14,215
All right you guys. Come on now,
come on.

764
01:09:24,145 --> 01:09:30,145
Keep moving. What are you doing
up there? Mailing letters?

765
01:09:32,027 --> 01:09:35,716
Corwin...

766
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:38,841
Hey Corwin you all right?

767
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:41,379
Water! Get some water! Hurry up!

768
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,142
Here you are Serg. What do I do
with it?

769
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:46,143
Let him have it.

770
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:56,658
Wait a second. Now take it easy.

771
01:09:56,659 --> 01:10:00,059
Come on. You all right Corwin?

772
01:11:53,756 --> 01:11:57,503
Well I'm glad to see that they finally
fixed that soft drink machine.

773
01:11:57,504 --> 01:12:01,895
Well, I think I'll go in there and take
care of that supply sergeant now.

774
01:12:01,896 --> 01:12:07,582
You know, he turns the same
articles in for salvage over and over again.

775
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:11,783
You'd think he was going to open up
and army and navy store.

776
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,722
As you were.

777
01:12:16,723 --> 01:12:20,123
- Sergeant Miller?
- Yes Sergeant?

778
01:12:20,857 --> 01:12:24,080
- Hey where's Sergeant Puccinelli?
- I don't know.

779
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:25,886
Boy he's sure in trouble again.

780
01:12:25,887 --> 01:12:29,397
The Colonel's after him, the
Captain's after him and Millie's after him.

781
01:12:29,398 --> 01:12:33,398
I wouldn't trade places with him with
14 points.

782
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:48,029
I see that you took care of that
supply situation to your satisfation.

783
01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:49,849
Yes sir!

784
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:53,850
I don't think we'll have anymore
trouble with Sergeant Miller.

785
01:13:10,376 --> 01:13:14,850
Boy that was close! The Colonel
almost had me that time.

786
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:18,251
- Got a cigarette.
- Yeah, sure Serg. Here, roll your own.

787
01:13:18,252 --> 01:13:21,252
That'll be all Sergeant Miller.

788
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,870
What's Miller featuring today?

789
01:13:39,779 --> 01:13:42,979
- 40. medium?
- Yep.

790
01:13:52,218 --> 01:13:52,909
Yes sir?

791
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:57,410
Have you made any progress
finding out about that girl?

792
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,920
- What girl? - The one who was
in the orderly room yesterday.

793
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:03,991
Oh yes sir. I have a hunch sir.

794
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:06,239
I want to see that man as soon as
possible.

795
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:09,240
Yes sir.

796
01:14:13,963 --> 01:14:16,892
- Hey where's Corwin?
- He's in the rec hall rehearsing.

797
01:14:16,893 --> 01:14:20,893
Rehearsing for what? How to
become a mental case?

798
01:15:43,329 --> 01:15:45,146
- Okay, come on, let's go.
- Where?

799
01:15:45,147 --> 01:15:47,870
- To see Captain Caldwell.
- What'd I do now?

800
01:15:47,871 --> 01:15:51,975
- You'll find out and I'm delivering
you C.O.D. - What about the number?

801
01:15:51,976 --> 01:15:54,483
- What number?
- You promised Pokey you'd do it.

802
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:57,884
Well tell him to get with it, but hurry up.

803
01:15:58,074 --> 01:15:59,211
All right, go ahead, ask him.

804
01:15:59,212 --> 01:16:02,319
But watch how you ask him. In a
nice way. Use a little diplomacy.

805
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,586
You say: Pokey, will you play a
song for Vic and I, we're going to dance.

806
01:16:05,587 --> 01:16:10,262
Cause you and me Alvin. We're
going to be together a long, long time. You and me, we're friends right?

807
01:16:10,263 --> 01:16:15,010
So go ahead and ask Pokey. So go
ahead and ask him and I'll wait too. Go ahead.

808
01:16:15,011 --> 01:16:18,871
You say: Pokey, play some music
for Vic and I. Go ahead. What are you waiting for?

809
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:21,255
Okay!

810
01:16:21,256 --> 01:16:24,282
I forgot what I was going to ask him now.

811
01:16:24,283 --> 01:16:28,648
Oh yeah! Pokey, will you play this dance
song so that Vic and I can do this together?

812
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:32,049
- Sure.
- Thanks a heap.

813
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:36,763
- Old song and dance?
- Old song and dance?

814
01:17:35,248 --> 01:17:38,848
No, the whole band, they should
play it together.

815
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:43,942
What are you waiting for?

816
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:47,943
Look buster, I don't do it unless the
Sergeant tells me.

817
01:17:48,426 --> 01:17:51,226
Okay folks.

818
01:18:12,984 --> 01:18:15,276
All right folks, let's quiet down now.

819
01:18:15,277 --> 01:18:20,088
We'd like to present First Sergeant
Victor Puccinelli and Private First Class, Alvin Corwin.

820
01:18:20,089 --> 01:18:24,289
Doing their impression of two great
personalities.

821
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:41,599
Well, top of the morning to you
friend.

822
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,116
How are you me boy?

823
01:18:45,117 --> 01:18:49,717
I just thought I'd stop over now son,
and let you know that...

824
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:53,500
I don't knock the idea of you leaving
in St. Dominique's charge.

825
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:57,571
Well I kind of hate to see you leave
the place too padre.

826
01:18:57,572 --> 01:19:03,972
- I was just wondering if I might ask
a wee bit of a favor son. -Well, go right ahead.

827
01:19:04,132 --> 01:19:09,250
I would love you to sing one of me
old Irish lullabyes. Just once now, before you go.

828
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:13,078
Now which little lrish lullabye you
thinking about?

829
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:17,679
The one you did that night I was so
sick in bed son. You remember that one, now don't you lad?

830
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:22,857
Well, couldn't rightly do it for you
tonight Padre, for I got to have music behind me, you know that.

831
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:27,641
But I've got a musicbox with me.
Won't you try now son?

832
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:33,442
- It should be a pleasure to do it for you.
- Just open it wide open.

833
01:20:45,999 --> 01:20:49,531
Sir, would you still like to see the
man I spoke to you about? The one that caused all the trouble.

834
01:20:49,532 --> 01:20:51,831
- Most definetly!
- Yes sir.

835
01:20:51,832 --> 01:20:53,281
Corwin...

836
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:56,282
Come here.

837
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:07,353
Private First Class Corwin reporting
sir, as ordered.

838
01:21:07,354 --> 01:21:08,858
At ease.

839
01:21:08,859 --> 01:21:10,462
Corwin...

840
01:21:10,463 --> 01:21:11,463
What's your first name?

841
01:21:11,464 --> 01:21:13,626
- Alvin.
- Alvin?

842
01:21:13,627 --> 01:21:14,642
Yes sir.

843
01:21:14,643 --> 01:21:19,910
Alvin, bringing children into the
world is a solemn matter.

844
01:21:19,911 --> 01:21:23,100
Solemn sir? I didn't think it was so
solemn.

845
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:24,693
That's the trouble.

846
01:21:24,694 --> 01:21:27,986
Sometimes we don't realize it until
it's too late.

847
01:21:27,987 --> 01:21:30,917
Now, what do you intend to do
about this matter?

848
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:32,623
Nothing sir. Everything been done
already.

849
01:21:32,624 --> 01:21:35,442
That's the wrong attitude entirely.

850
01:21:35,443 --> 01:21:38,832
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No sir. I'm very proud.

851
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:39,853
Proud?

852
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:42,797
Yes sir. We wanted a baby, so we
got a baby.

853
01:21:42,798 --> 01:21:45,614
- You wanted a baby?
- Yes sir.

854
01:21:45,615 --> 01:21:49,737
But don't you understand? You
can't let this baby grow up without a name.

855
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,528
I know. We'll think of a name for it.

856
01:21:51,529 --> 01:21:53,759
That's not what I mean.

857
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,311
Now Corwin, listen to me closely.

858
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,987
Do you have any love for this
woman?

859
01:21:59,988 --> 01:22:04,483
- Yes sir. I love her very much.
- Then my job should be simple.

860
01:22:04,484 --> 01:22:09,023
I'm going to give you a three-day
pass, so that you can go to this girl and do right by her.

861
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,062
Oh thank-you sir.

862
01:22:10,063 --> 01:22:14,298
But understand, this pass is only to
give this baby a name.

863
01:22:14,299 --> 01:22:16,738
Three-day pass to think of a
name...

864
01:22:16,739 --> 01:22:18,375
I know sir, we'll name it after you.

865
01:22:18,376 --> 01:22:20,272
That's not necessary.

866
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:25,171
But I'll tell you this: when the baby
is born, I'll see to it that you get an emergency furlow.

867
01:22:25,172 --> 01:22:27,336
But sir I... No buts about it!

868
01:22:27,337 --> 01:22:33,937
Get into class A uniform.
- Yes sir.

869
01:22:38,136 --> 01:22:40,867
Puccinelli. I've decided to give
Corwin a three-day pass.

870
01:22:40,868 --> 01:22:43,453
Pass? But Captain, after what he
did?

871
01:22:43,454 --> 01:22:47,142
Well I have to give him a pass, so
he can get married.

872
01:22:47,143 --> 01:22:49,205
Get married? What for?

873
01:22:49,206 --> 01:22:53,224
Puccinelli. Is this or is this not the
man who is in trouble?

874
01:22:53,225 --> 01:22:59,091
Sir, yes sir! He's in trouble all right.
What he means is, the baby's already been born.

875
01:22:59,092 --> 01:23:00,998
- Is that right Corwin?
- Ah, yes sir.

876
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:03,140
Yes mam', yes sergeant.

877
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:05,887
Oh, that's different. Give me that pass.

878
01:23:05,888 --> 01:23:09,142
- Oh but Captain!
- We'll give you an emergency furlow.

879
01:23:09,143 --> 01:23:11,455
Oh thank-you.

880
01:23:11,456 --> 01:23:14,480
Get this Corwin, you'd better bring
back a marriage certificate.

881
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:16,588
Oh that's easy. I got one in the
barracks.

882
01:23:16,589 --> 01:23:21,373
He doesn't mean his own sir. One of
the boys has one tacked up on the wall.

883
01:23:21,374 --> 01:23:23,903
Corwin, you'd better get ready to go.

884
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:27,104
Yes Sergeant.

885
01:23:33,315 --> 01:23:36,005
- Well I'm off to battalion.
- Sir, do you want me to type up these furlow papers?

886
01:23:36,006 --> 01:23:40,606
No, I'll have it done at
headquarters. I want to push it right through.

887
01:23:42,953 --> 01:23:45,127
Clark, don't leave me here alone.

888
01:23:45,128 --> 01:23:48,596
- Cutie!
- Millie, what a surprise to see you here.

889
01:23:48,597 --> 01:23:51,727
Well, I've been trying so hard to see you.

890
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:54,528
Millie, come here.

891
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:58,134
- Now tell me the truth.
- Are you going to have... Yes Vic.

892
01:23:58,135 --> 01:23:59,300
Where did you hear?

893
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:03,101
Where did I hear? Well it's
practilly a coast to coast hook-up.

894
01:24:03,466 --> 01:24:05,780
Look honey. Step into the Captain's
office, just for a minute.

895
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:08,011
NO! There's too much traffic in there.

896
01:24:08,012 --> 01:24:10,177
Please Millie.

897
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,978
Come in.

898
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:17,931
Victor Puccinelli. I have a few
questions to ask you.

899
01:24:17,932 --> 01:24:18,915
Helen, listen.

900
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:21,517
And the first one has to do with
Jack Edwards.

901
01:24:21,518 --> 01:24:23,009
Oh if that's all that's bothering you.

902
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:26,975
- Listen Cutie.
- Please Millie.

903
01:24:26,976 --> 01:24:28,750
Who was that girl?

904
01:24:28,751 --> 01:24:31,163
Mrs. Caldwell, the Captain's wife.

905
01:24:31,164 --> 01:24:35,544
If you send Jack Edwards out of
this camp, you can consider our relationship at an end.

906
01:24:35,545 --> 01:24:37,508
Oh you wouldn't do that, would you
honey?

907
01:24:37,509 --> 01:24:43,271
On the contrary. I'm not sure I'm in
love with either one of you. Well, I want to be fair to you both.

908
01:24:43,272 --> 01:24:45,479
- Now look...
- Good-afternoon Sergeant.

909
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,793
Captain Caldwell, Miss Palmer, I'd
like to have you meet her.

910
01:24:48,794 --> 01:24:51,582
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

911
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:55,783
Captain, I think you are wanted
down at battalion headquarters.

912
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:00,022
Can I help you?

913
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:02,051
Lt. Davenport!

914
01:25:02,052 --> 01:25:05,852
Now wait a minute. Don't mix me
up in this.

915
01:25:06,052 --> 01:25:08,313
- Maybe I'd better leave.
- No! One moment.

916
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:11,650
You've made a startling recovery,
haven't you?

917
01:25:11,651 --> 01:25:14,102
I don't know what you're talking about.

918
01:25:14,103 --> 01:25:16,994
- Sergeant Puccinelli.
- Yes sir.

919
01:25:16,995 --> 01:25:19,058
There he is. Corwin, come in here.

920
01:25:19,059 --> 01:25:21,013
Sit down young lady.

921
01:25:21,014 --> 01:25:24,133
- Can you explain...
- First Class Corwin reporting as ordered sir.

922
01:25:24,134 --> 01:25:29,007
Can you kindly explain why this
young lady is sitting here completely recovered...

923
01:25:29,008 --> 01:25:31,491
and you're about

924
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:33,751
and you're about to start an
emergency furlow?

925
01:25:33,752 --> 01:25:35,597
Recovered sir? What was wrong
with her?

926
01:25:35,598 --> 01:25:37,544
Don't try to be funny.

927
01:25:37,545 --> 01:25:40,669
I don't understand Captain. I never
saw that woman before last night.

928
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,845
You never saw her before last night?

929
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,718
- No!
- Then why do you think you're getting this furlow?

930
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,376
Cause my wife had a baby.

931
01:25:47,377 --> 01:25:49,720
Your wife had a baby.

932
01:25:49,721 --> 01:25:53,721
Yes sir. Here's a telegram I got.

933
01:25:55,892 --> 01:25:58,538
Well, I think I get this now.

934
01:25:58,539 --> 01:26:03,137
- Do you know him?
- No, but he's cute.

935
01:26:03,138 --> 01:26:07,302
- Here's your furlow.
- Take it and get out. Thank-you Captain. Yes sir.

936
01:26:07,303 --> 01:26:12,303
- And give my love to the baby.
- Yes sir, I will sir. Thank-you Captain. Good-bye.

937
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:20,021
Now young lady...

938
01:26:20,022 --> 01:26:22,336
Where is everybody? Sergeant
Puccinelli.

939
01:26:22,337 --> 01:26:23,364
Yes sir.

940
01:26:23,365 --> 01:26:26,097
Do you realize that this whole mess
is still up in the air? Corwin wasn't the man.

941
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,464
He wasn't sir?

942
01:26:27,465 --> 01:26:29,913
I can't understand your attitude lately.

943
01:26:29,914 --> 01:26:31,721
I guess I'll have to take care of this
myself.

944
01:26:31,722 --> 01:26:34,218
Give me the company roster with
the physical descriptions of the men.

945
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:36,619
Yes sir.

946
01:26:58,179 --> 01:27:05,130
Well, I suppose we should introduce
ourselves. I'm Helen Palmer and this is ah...

947
01:27:05,131 --> 01:27:08,136
Captain Caldwell's wife.

948
01:27:08,137 --> 01:27:11,245
And, who are you?

949
01:27:11,246 --> 01:27:13,452
I'm not quite sure.

950
01:27:13,453 --> 01:27:15,092
The Captain would like to see you.

951
01:27:15,093 --> 01:27:20,293
Me? Oh, but I was just in there.

952
01:27:22,379 --> 01:27:25,426
Ernie Caldwell! What's the
meaning of this?

953
01:27:25,427 --> 01:27:27,302
She was introduced to me as your wife.

954
01:27:27,303 --> 01:27:28,516
Now wait a minute.

955
01:27:28,517 --> 01:27:31,397
What do you mean when you said
you had just been in here?

956
01:27:31,398 --> 01:27:35,743
I was just in here. I was here last
night too.

957
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:39,381
The desk was here, there was a
chair there and over there...

958
01:27:39,382 --> 01:27:43,574
Now darling, this is an army matter.
This is not your affair.

959
01:27:43,575 --> 01:27:44,754
Now young lady, what's the
meaning of this.

960
01:27:44,755 --> 01:27:46,318
- Captain, I can...
- Sergeant Puccinelli.

961
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:49,936
- Ernie Caldwell! Can't you stay
outside until this is settled?

962
01:27:49,937 --> 01:27:51,939
If there's anything going on, I want
to know about it.

963
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:55,000
Then let's both get outside and I'll
try to explain.

964
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:57,728
- I don't understand...
- But Captain.

965
01:27:57,729 --> 01:27:59,531
Oh come on Millie, let's get out of here.

966
01:27:59,532 --> 01:28:02,305
But I still don't understand.

967
01:28:02,306 --> 01:28:05,162
Why is everybody picking on me?

968
01:28:05,163 --> 01:28:08,603
Hi ya Cutie! Well honey, what are
you doing here?

969
01:28:08,604 --> 01:28:12,250
I was worried. I came over here to
ask Vic about you going on that shipment.

970
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:15,385
Oh don't worry. Cutie will see that I
don't go.

971
01:28:15,386 --> 01:28:17,734
Come on, why don't you give up?`
You can't win.

972
01:28:17,735 --> 01:28:19,460
Puccinelli, we have something that
must be settled.

973
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:23,547
Now just a minute. For 5 years this
army has been deciding things for me to do...

974
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:27,558
But I'm in the driver's seat this time.
I don't want to be a warrant-officer. I want to go overseas.

975
01:28:27,559 --> 01:28:30,959
I want to get away from everything.
Away from all this.

976
01:28:32,442 --> 01:28:34,990
That sir is something else I'm
deciding. I'm busting myself.

977
01:28:34,991 --> 01:28:39,191
- You can't do that.
- I can't, but you can do it for me. Watch.

978
01:28:39,475 --> 01:28:41,808
- Oh honey.
- Ernie!

979
01:28:41,809 --> 01:28:43,339
- What did you call him?
- Ernie.

980
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,480
- Did he say he was Ernie
Caldwell? - Yes.

981
01:28:45,481 --> 01:28:47,477
- Then there is something...
- Ladies, please!

982
01:28:47,478 --> 01:28:51,078
Now if you'll just wait dear.

983
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,552
Is he the man you have been going
steady with?

984
01:28:53,553 --> 01:28:56,976
- No, I only met him last night.
- Last night?

985
01:28:56,977 --> 01:29:00,691
Oh I think this whole thing is silly.
Let's get out of here.

986
01:29:00,692 --> 01:29:03,746
Now then Miss. You must have
gone out with another in this company?

987
01:29:03,747 --> 01:29:04,883
Present sir!

988
01:29:04,884 --> 01:29:09,756
So it's you Puccinelli. Well, I'm going
to give you exactly what you asked for.

989
01:29:09,757 --> 01:29:11,655
You'll be reduced to private and
shipped overseas.

990
01:29:11,656 --> 01:29:12,731
Thank-you sir.

991
01:29:12,732 --> 01:29:16,962
And don't think this relieves you of
your responsibilities to this woman you are married to.

992
01:29:16,963 --> 01:29:19,012
- Married to me?
- Now don't deny it.

993
01:29:19,013 --> 01:29:23,400
Oh but he isn't. I'm already
married, to someone else.

994
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:28,022
John Slaker. Has been since a
week after I broke up with Vic.

995
01:29:28,023 --> 01:29:30,201
Well what have you been looking
for me for?

996
01:29:30,202 --> 01:29:33,479
Because I want to tell you not
to come and

997
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,394
see me tonight, like you
promised 4 months ago.

998
01:29:36,395 --> 01:29:40,527
Before John and I were married.
You won't come, will you?

999
01:29:40,528 --> 01:29:43,168
Holy Toledo, no!

1000
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:47,538
I'm so glad. My husband might not
understand...

1001
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:52,095
. he's not very bright and I don't
want to cause any trouble.

1002
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:57,450
Oh well, good-bye and thanks so much.

1003
01:29:57,451 --> 01:30:00,391
- Don't think that this will clear you.
- We're still busting you.

1004
01:30:00,392 --> 01:30:03,234
Okay, so I'm busted. For once I've
beaten the army.

1005
01:30:03,235 --> 01:30:05,260
While all these other guys are
rotting here in the states...

1006
01:30:05,261 --> 01:30:09,261
., I'll be on the other side and the army
had nothing to do with it. I did it all myself.

1007
01:30:10,045 --> 01:30:12,105
- What the devil is that?
- I don't know sir.

1008
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:13,815
It sounds like a special call.

1009
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:17,735
Captain Caldwell. Have you heard
the news. All movements, transfers and furlows have been cancelled.

1010
01:30:17,736 --> 01:30:19,103
- Movements cancelled.
- Sure.

1011
01:30:19,104 --> 01:30:20,927
Sure, the whole outfit is going
overseas.

1012
01:30:20,928 --> 01:30:24,508
- But darling, why didn't you?
- Sally never told me.

1013
01:30:24,509 --> 01:30:28,028
Ernie Caldwell. Step into my office.

1014
01:30:28,029 --> 01:30:31,829
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1015
01:30:32,379 --> 01:30:33,582
Let go of me.

1016
01:30:33,583 --> 01:30:36,616
Serg, I just caught this man trying to
sneak off the boat.

1017
01:30:36,617 --> 01:30:38,641
Don't bother me, I'm out of business.

1018
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:41,585
Sneak off the boat nothing. I've got
a furlow. I've got to see my baby.

1019
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:43,692
- You ain't got no furlow.
- I have!

1020
01:30:43,693 --> 01:30:45,987
- No you don't.
- I have!

1021
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:46,382
QUIET!

1022
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:48,899
- All furlows is cancelled.
- Cancelled!

1023
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:54,700
Right, the whole division is going
overseas. - OVERSEAS!

1024
01:30:54,924 --> 01:30:59,045
Wait a minute, you too.

1025
01:30:59,046 --> 01:31:06,046
That's right. Come on Private
Puccinelli. Join your buddy. Let's be getting on the ball.

1026
01:31:08,499 --> 01:31:10,675
- Pick it up.
- Pick what up?

1027
01:31:10,676 --> 01:31:12,538
The suitcase.

1028
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:16,139
Private Puccinelli.

1029
01:31:21,865 --> 01:31:24,865
Vic.

1030
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:27,600
I'll take it.

1031
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:30,699
- What?
- The bag.

1032
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,700
Nah, come on. I'll take it.

1033
