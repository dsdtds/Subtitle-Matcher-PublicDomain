1
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,758
What are you looking for?

2
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:54,192
Where is my hat?

3
00:00:58,163 --> 00:01:00,154
Well, why don't you look for it?

4
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:04,433
Why don't i look for it?
I've looked everywhere!

5
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:08,476
- Everywhere?
- Yes. Everywhere that a hat might be.

6
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:10,798
That's the trouble with you wives,

7
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:14,119
You're always hiding things
so we can't find them.

8
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:17,121
I can't even find the telephone in this house.

9
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:20,951
But i'll find that hat if it's the last thing i do.

10
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:31,635
Yoo-Hoo.

11
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:33,480
Tilly.

12
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:40,158
Have you seen my hat?

13
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:43,400
- Why... L...
- Don't stand there stuttering!

14
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:47,197
- Have you seen my hat?
- Of course she's seen your hat.

15
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:49,438
You may leave.

16
00:01:57,443 --> 00:01:59,354
There you are.

17
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:03,032
How do you expect me
to uphold the dignity of my home

18
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:06,359
When you belittle me
in front of the servants?

19
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:08,519
This has gone far enough.

20
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,394
If i don't find that hat,

21
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:14,231
I'm leaving this house
never to darken its doors again.

22
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:36,273
Ahem.

23
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:41,117
I'm gonna take one more look

24
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:44,075
And if i don't find it...

25
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:46,193
Have a care.

26
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:02,198
Oh, you've found it!

27
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:04,916
Yes. What was it doing under the bed?

28
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:14,672
Now where are you going?

29
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,191
I have an appointment with stanley.

30
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:19,234
What about our radio?

31
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:23,799
- What about it?
- It hasn't worked in three months.

32
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:27,995
Just because you've been
too indisposed to put up an aerial.

33
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:33,515
- I'll put it up tomorrow.
- You'll put it up today! Right now.

34
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:41,992
I thought you were going to meet me.

35
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,758
I was, but i've got to put the aerial up.

36
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:53,152
Mrs hardy wants to get japan.

37
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:59,511
Gee, i'd like to hear japan, too.
Do you mind if i help you?

38
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,551
I don't mind.

39
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,594
That is if you'll help me.

40
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:09,399
Back your car in.

41
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,556
- What's the matter?
- Get some water! Water!

42
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,033
Now pick that ladder up.

43
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,554
Pick up the ladder.

44
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,958
Well, come on, pick up those things.

45
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:28,837
The quicker we get the aerial up,
the quicker we get away.

46
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:32,001
W-Why don't you be... C-C-Careful?

47
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,078
Have you got everything?

48
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:49,593
Everything.
We don't have to go down for a thing.

49
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:56,598
Put one of those poles on that end.

50
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,791
Ohh!

51
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:55,313
Hey! What did you go down for?

52
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,399
Here. Now put that end on that pole.

53
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:29,434
Go ahead! Oh!

54
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,034
Take that.

55
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,558
Ohhhh!

56
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:04,434
Will you stop your playing?

57
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:16,680
I think you'd better go in the house
and i'll pass the wire down to you.

58
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:21,834
Well, go ahead.

59
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:50,476
Hook that on binding post a.

60
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:32,399
Listen! I think you better let that radio go.

61
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,434
I should say not!

62
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,919
I'll get that thing working
if it's the last thing i do.

63
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,954
Come on.

64
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,875
Now listen, if you don't be careful,

65
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,914
I'm gonna break your neck.

66
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:18,234
Oh, oliver, darling, this is terrible!

67
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,843
Don't cry over me, dear, i'm not hurt.

68
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:25,434
I'm not crying over you,
the man came and took the radio away.

69
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:51,960
Hey!

70
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:56,037
Get that thing out of here, will you?
