1
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,900
Strange looking place.

2
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,990
What I thought.

3
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,840
Fuel pump.

4
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,506
How long you think
it'll take you to fix?

5
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,160
Has to be replaced.

6
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,140
Take about a half an hour
if they have the part.

7
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,020
They should have one with
all these wrecks around here.

8
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,867
This back highway's good for
time, but have car trouble

9
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,631
and you've got problems.

10
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,711
If it had to happen, I'm
glad it happened where it did

11
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:31,240
and when it did.

12
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,260
I didn't much relish the idea of
being stuck on those mountains.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,850
I'd say we're lucky.

14
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,671
Another few miles, we'd
have been in desert.

15
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:40,150
Is it what you
thought, Mr. Stiles?

16
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,661
I'm afraid so.

17
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,450
Can we still make the game?

18
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,240
Oh, we got 40 miles to go.

19
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,190
12:01.

20
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,430
Game doesn't start 'til 1:30.

21
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,360
We can still make it
if they have the part.

22
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,985
And if they don't?

23
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:57,511
It's plain stuck.

24
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,851
If it wasn't Sunday, they
could order one from Lancaster.

25
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,000
Where are the people
who run this place?

26
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,071
Hello?

27
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,820
You see, when the
player swats the ball...

28
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,980
Not swats the ball, Doris.

29
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,581
Bats.

30
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:45,581
The player bats the ball.

31
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:46,170
Yeah.

32
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,516
When the player bats the ball
and it goes over the fence...

33
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,270
That's a home run.

34
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:49,870
I know.

35
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,595
But if no one can
make him out, why

36
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,320
does he have to run
around the bases?

37
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,455
Because he has to.

38
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:55,555
That's the rules.

39
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:57,335
He must touch every base.

40
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,180
Would you like a Coke?

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,820
Oh, thank you.

42
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,000
Somebody can run off
with the whole place

43
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,336
and the owner would
never know it.

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,095
Coke, Ed?

45
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:17,430
Sure.

46
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,531
From the looks
of things, nothing

47
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,840
'round here worth taking.

48
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,780
It's a wonder they get
any business at all.

49
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Everything is so
dirty and greasy.

50
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,060
All work isn't white
collar work, Miss Page.

51
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,650
I was in the Army.

52
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,660
I had my fill of
this repairing tanks.

53
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,020
Miss Prim and Proper
should have known me then.

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,860
Doris Page is a sweet girl,
Ed, and a good math teacher.

55
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,630
Uh, a little on the
prudish side, perhaps.

56
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:59,471
A boy in my phys ed class
calls her Miss Ice Buckets.

57
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:02,351
Mr. Oliver, I think
theirs is a, a silly rule.

58
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,571
There is no reason why a man
should have to run around

59
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:07,410
the bases when they
can't get him out.

60
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,750
Isn't that a woman for you?

61
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,471
Never seen a baseball
game and already

62
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,030
she's changing the rules.

63
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,805
You should go to a
ball game with my wife.

64
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,481
Well, I still think
that's a silly rule.

65
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:21,770
We're never going to
see any baseball today.

66
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,740
Where's the guy that
runs this place?

67
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,620
Hey, what about some service?

68
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,460
Hello?

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,411
They must be around
here some place.

70
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Doesn't seem likely
they'd go away

71
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,800
and leave everything wide open.

72
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,330
Perhaps they're around
in back some place.

73
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,310
Hey, anybody here?

74
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,760
Hello?

75
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,970
Hello?

76
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,206
If the pump hadn't already
been stripped off that Chevy,

77
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,481
we might be in business.

78
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:53,600
We got ourselves a fuel
pump if it's any good.

79
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,311
Will that work on our car?

80
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:59,190
Take a few adjustments,
but should get us to LA.

81
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,571
I'll borrow a few wrenches,
and we'll soon be out of here.

82
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,511
Our Mr. Stiles
has many talents.

83
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:12,570
A fine young man.

84
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,050
Be a lucky woman that hooks him.

85
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,590
Oh, Mr. Oliver, I do believe
you're playing Cupid again.

86
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,300
You're only young
once, Miss Page.

87
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,620
Why, Mr. Oliver, you
sound like an old man.

88
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,381
Well, 52 yesterday.

89
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:43,080
I'd say you'd had a
fine and full life.

90
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,980
A nice home, a lovely wife,
two handsome children.

91
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,880
Carl Junior graduates from
West Point in two weeks.

92
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,740
Wife and I are going
back for the graduation.

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,680
This guy really takes
care of his tools.

94
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,390
Wonder where these people are.

95
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:02,331
I'll look around and see
if I can find somebody.

96
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:11,605
I don't want to
shock you, Miss Page,

97
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,940
but I'd rather not
get my shirt dirty.

98
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,210
Oh really, Mr. Stiles,
I'm not that stuffy.

99
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,510
I don't know.

100
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,695
We've taught the same
school for over a year

101
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,780
and it's still Miss
Page and Mr. Stiles.

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,180
I do think Ed and Doris
would sound a lot better.

103
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,680
From now on it shall
be Ed and Doris.

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,730
Just a snake skin.

105
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,850
They shed this time of year.

106
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,725
I can't stand snakes.

107
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,500
Most people can't.

108
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,605
Part of the country's
loaded with them, big ones.

109
00:08:56,705 --> 00:09:00,710
I hear they get to be as
much as nine feet long.

110
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,500
Well, I was certainly
wrong, wasn't I?

111
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,250
Hello?

112
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,900
Hello?

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Anybody here?

114
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,740
Hello?

115
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:57,171
Hello?

116
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,570
Doris?

117
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,915
Ed?

118
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:04,761
Hello?

119
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,420
Hello?

120
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,856
You'd never know
he's the same history

121
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,740
teacher from old Lancaster High.

122
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,330
He really cuts loose.

123
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,550
Today he'll really be in
this glory with his red flag.

124
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,981
I know.

125
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,071
Edna told me last night
that he hasn't seen them

126
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:38,081
play since they left Cincinnati.

127
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:39,936
She said ever since he got
the tickets he's been...

128
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,620
There's something going on
here that just isn't right.

129
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,380
Settings were four at the
kitchen table, two plates eaten

130
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,150
from and two plates
untouched, pie still warm.

131
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,820
Except for a cat there's
not a sign of life.

132
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,460
The sooner we get out of here,
the better off I'll feel.

133
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,415
Just keep working,
mister, because you're

134
00:12:35,515 --> 00:12:37,497
going to fix your car
just like you intended.

135
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,580
Young man, you have
no right to take our...

136
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,470
Shut up.

137
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,740
What if I don't fix it?

138
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,320
You'll fix it all right, mister.

139
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,001
You better not take
too long, either.

140
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,820
Supposing I get it
fixed, what happens then?

141
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,640
Me and my girl go away
and won't bother you.

142
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:03,490
How do we know
you'll keep your word?

143
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,380
Looks like you're just going to
have take it, ain'tcha, mister?

144
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,090
You, give me your wallet.

145
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,840
There's not much, but
you're welcome to it.

146
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,600
Well, we're only
schoolteachers, young man.

147
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,320
You hear that, Judy?

148
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,020
"We're only schoolteachers."

149
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,090
We don't like
schoolteachers, do we, Judy?

150
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,861
Teachers think they're so much
smarter than everybody else.

151
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,250
You have our money.

152
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,775
Isn't that enough?

153
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,200
What else do you want?

154
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Just keep working, mister.

155
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:57,470
Teachers used to call
Judy dumb, make fun of her,

156
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,951
send her home from
school crying.

157
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,730
No!

158
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,930
Stop it!

159
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,671
You're a pretty good size, boy.

160
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,761
I wonder how tough you'd
be without that gun.

161
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:28,210
Ooh, you're one
of them real big talkers,

162
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,060
ain't you, mister?

163
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,050
All right, big talker,
hand over your wallet.

164
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,180
Come on.

165
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,691
Pick it up.

166
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,000
You pick it up.

167
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,125
You're a real big man in
front of your lady friend.

168
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,787
But I'm going to show her
just how big you really are.

169
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:02,779
Put down that gun and I'll
show you how big you are.

170
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,771
I'm giving you three seconds,
mister, to do what I say.

171
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm saying you pick
up that wallet.

172
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,840
One, two.

173
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,480
Please, do as he says.

174
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:29,410
Uh, you put on the fender.

175
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,841
Or do you want the gun, huh?

176
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:32,040
You want the gun?

177
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,730
On the fender.

178
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,330
Big man, huh?

179
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,590
I guess you got showed
how big you really was.

180
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,900
Start working.

181
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,561
May I get some water?

182
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,781
This poor man has been
blinded by his own blood.

183
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,761
Don't you even have the decency
to let me care for this man?

184
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,520
What kind of a person are you?

185
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,641
Do you enjoy hurting
others, seeing them in pain?

186
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:47,580
How can you be so inhuman?

187
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:50,090
How is he?

188
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,020
His head is all right,
but I know it must hurt.

189
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,291
The gash in his cheek
isn't too, too bad,

190
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:58,421
but the cut over his eye,
it won't stop bleeding.

191
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:01,451
I'm afraid he might
bleed to death.

192
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:04,481
Now, now, Doris, it
can't be that bad.

193
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:05,686
Where do you think you're going?

194
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,886
This man needs
help, and he's going

195
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,510
to get it if you
want this car fixed.

196
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,290
He's going to be
all right, Doris.

197
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,841
You're lucky, Carl.

198
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,810
A little more to the right
you wouldn't be here.

199
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,036
If we can get you some
water and in the shade

200
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,361
we can stop the bleeding.

201
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,221
What about letting this
man get in the shade?

202
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,301
How can you be so cruel?

203
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,682
You get back in that car, and
he won't be needing nothing.

204
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:03,960
Oh, by all means,
enjoy your lovemaking.

205
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,040
Well, the least
you can do is allow

206
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,020
a suffering man a little water.

207
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,680
Carrying on like that when...
You're no more than an animal!

208
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,980
You get your dirty hands off me.

209
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,080
You leave her alone if
you want the car fixed.

210
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,120
And he won't fix it unless
you let us get some water.

211
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,337
There's a pump by the house.

212
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,130
You keep working
on that car, mister.

213
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,150
And you, go ahead.

214
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,960
Shoot if they move, Judy.

215
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:14,620
If I hear a shot, your
girlfriend is dead.

216
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,360
Don't get no ideas.

217
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,050
Judy don't know
how to use a gun.

218
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:15,470
I wonder, I wonder why
he changed his mind.

219
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,630
Ed, I don't like this.

220
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,500
I know something else
you won't like, Carl.

221
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,720
Remember reading last week
about those brutal killings

222
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,335
in Arizona?

223
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,140
Will you please let me by?

224
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,315
Why are you putting us
through this torture?

225
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:11,900
You have our money and
you're taking our car.

226
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,020
Isn't that enough?

227
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,060
You keep your
dirty hands off me.

228
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,341
You think your so
much better than me.

229
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:24,270
Your kind all think that way.

230
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,001
You called me inhuman.

231
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,320
All right.

232
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:28,970
I apologize.

233
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,980
I shouldn't have said that.

234
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,800
Now, will you let me go?

235
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,620
Called me an animal.

236
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,930
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,471
I'm sorry I said those things.

238
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,440
Now, can I go?

239
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,020
You're sorry, but
you still think it.

240
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,730
You think I'm dirt.

241
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,341
You think Judy's dirt.

242
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:48,670
You'll always think it 'til
you don't think no more.

243
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,351
Your kind means
nothing, you hear?

244
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:52,550
Nothing.

245
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:58,840
Why don't you scream?

246
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,650
Maybe the big talker
will come and help you.

247
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,605
Maybe Miss Goodie
Good Good still

248
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:06,560
thinks she's so
much better than me.

249
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:15,040
How does it feel to be
touched by dirt, huh?

250
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,670
Goodie Good Good don't like it.

251
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,490
Taste it.

252
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,850
Taste it!

253
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,950
Eat the dirt.

254
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,410
Taste it.

255
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,311
Miss Goodie Good don't think
she's so much now, does she?

256
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,351
She don't mind being
touched by dirt.

257
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,715
Get moving.

258
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,980
What did he do to you, child?

259
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,201
It's all right, Mr. Oliver.

260
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,200
It's all right.

261
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,910
Get back to work.

262
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,350
You want that car fixed,
you can do it yourself.

263
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,340
Starting to be the
big man again, huh?

264
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,860
You're the big man, Tibbs.

265
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,380
That's the name, isn't it?

266
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,840
Charlie Tibbs?

267
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,270
The big man who
killed seven people.

268
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,161
Made them get on their knees
and shot them in the head.

269
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:56,131
The paper calls you
a thrill killer.

270
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:58,440
Must be a real thrill to
wipe out a family of five.

271
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,750
How many thrills have you
had since you left Arizona?

272
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,916
What about the people here?

273
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,740
Did you kill them too?

274
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,187
How long do you
think you could keep

275
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:05,850
getting away with this, son?

276
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,530
The law's bound to catch up
with you sooner or later.

277
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,510
And the law has ways
of handling murderers.

278
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,090
Please don't
antagonize him any more.

279
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,555
What's going to happen to you?

280
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,020
Anybody opens their mouth again,

281
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,520
I'll blow their brains out.

282
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,600
Listen, big man, you get
back to fixing that car,

283
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,510
or you're going to be
a big dead man fast.

284
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,525
All of a sudden
everybody's becoming

285
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,161
the big talker,
getting kind of brave.

286
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,910
Nobody wants to
talk no more, Judy.

287
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,740
I'm going to get my goodie bag.

288
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,210
Judy, bring me a soda.

289
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,951
Just a little target practice.

290
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,620
I'm going to shake
the bottle over

291
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,811
head.

292
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,010
Mr. Oliver, they're going
to do something terrible,

293
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,510
I just know it.

294
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,020
You, get up.

295
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,301
Over there.

296
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:08,281
What are you going to do?

297
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:09,690
Shut up.

298
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,940
Move!

299
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,741
That's far enough.

300
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,610
Down on your knees.

301
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,881
On your knees!

302
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,670
Seeing as how you like to
talk, go ahead and talk.

303
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,670
Talk all you want.

304
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,650
As soon as I finish this, you
going to be through talking.

305
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,060
School be out for you, teacher.

306
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,690
You better start
talking, mister.

307
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,380
Your time's running out.

308
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,690
You can't shoot me like this
for no reason, for nothing.

309
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,281
Surely blowing my head off
can't give you a thrill.

310
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,000
Is it money you need?

311
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,241
I have close to
$2,300 in the bank.

312
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:22,605
Tomorrow you can call my wife.

313
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,870
She'll give it to
you, all of it.

314
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:31,131
You and your girlfriend can
have a lot of fun on $2,300.

315
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:33,171
He sure is talking
a lot different

316
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:37,660
than he did a while
ago, ain't he, Judy?

317
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,410
You have a father, don't you?

318
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,710
Would you want someone
doing this to him?

319
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:51,201
Think of your own father
in my place, or yours.

320
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:53,620
Save your breath on her, mister.

321
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,121
I'm the only thing
in the world she has.

322
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:00,330
Her old man's dead, and
her old lady's a drunk.

323
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,980
Young lady, can't you
realize this is wrong?

324
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,410
You love him, don't you?

325
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,280
You know what it is to be
around someone you love

326
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,240
and who loves you?

327
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,251
I have loved ones too, a
daughter a little older

328
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:26,940
than you, a son about his age.

329
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,370
Please, I beg of you,
talk to your boyfriend.

330
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,510
Tell him this is wrong.

331
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,030
Tell him, please.

332
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,320
My god, child, haven't
you any feelings at all?

333
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,270
Can't you understand?

334
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,930
Look at him squirm, Judy.

335
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,960
They're all alike, ain't they?

336
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,780
Yellow when they go.

337
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:25,450
You just can't wipe out a man's
life like this, not like this.

338
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,440
We just can't stand
here and watch.

339
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,425
Ed, you can't let him do this.

340
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:34,410
Maybe he'll listen to you.

341
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,760
Talk to him.

342
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,011
Ed, talk to him.

343
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:41,280
Make somebody do something.

344
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,830
Tell him you won't fix the car.

345
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:43,660
Don't let him do it.

346
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,140
You want the car fixed?

347
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,380
Maybe the big man wants
to take your place.

348
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,720
He says one more word, he will.

349
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,330
What about it, big man.

350
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,940
You feel like talking?

351
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,780
Maybe Miss Good Good
wants to take his place.

352
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,661
I guess nobody wants to
take your place, mister.

353
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,171
School's out, teacher.

354
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:44,300
No.

355
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,340
No, please.

356
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,690
Don't.

357
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,210
Ed, Miss Page.

358
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,571
You monster, you monster!

359
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,066
Doris, Doris.

360
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,561
Go ahead, do it.

361
00:39:03,661 --> 00:39:04,431
Shut up.

362
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:05,130
Shut up yourself.

363
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,541
Doris, get control of yourself.

364
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,210
And you, you coward.

365
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,810
Doris!

366
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,660
Don't touch me.

367
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,206
Doris, you're going
to get us both shot.

368
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:11,770
I don't care.
I don't care.

369
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,190
Why don't you go
ahead and shoot?

370
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,030
Go on, shoot.

371
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,591
Go on, go on, shoot, shoot.

372
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:16,790
I don't care.

373
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,420
In another couple of minutes,
I'll have the pump out.

374
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,170
Shut up.

375
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,370
It won't take very long
to put it in the other car.

376
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,250
I said shut up.

377
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,726
Look, you're going
to need that car now,

378
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,550
and I'm the only
one that can fix it.

379
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,570
I ain't waiting too long.

380
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:55,641
Judy, go get me a
soda, and that pie too.

381
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,101
Poor Edna.

382
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:13,990
How will anybody
be able to tell?

383
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,525
His son's graduation.

384
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,960
Doris, believe me.

385
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,471
I feel as badly as you.

386
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:20,070
He's dead.

387
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,260
Nothing can bring him back.

388
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,800
We're alive.

389
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,441
We've got to think
of ourselves now.

390
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:35,400
Do you think I wanted to
stand there and watch him die?

391
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,200
What could I do?

392
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,805
What could anyone have done?

393
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,310
You can't reason with that kid.

394
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,770
He wants blood,
Doris, and nobody's

395
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,980
going to talk him out of it.

396
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,070
Don't you understand
what we're dealing with?

397
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,510
He's a psycho, Doris.

398
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,896
Or should I have
taken his place?

399
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:54,436
Would that have made
you feel better?

400
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:56,961
What would you be saying to Carl
if it was me lying over there?

401
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,225
The pump's out.

402
00:41:25,325 --> 00:41:26,970
All right.

403
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,810
Put it in the other car.

404
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,350
Ed, I'm sorry.

405
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,550
Forget it.

406
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,400
I feel so ashamed for
acting the way I did.

407
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,391
There was nothing we could do.

408
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,420
Why don't we just run?

409
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,705
The highway is only a
few yards from here.

410
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:37,812
He'd cut us down
before we got five feet.

411
00:42:37,912 --> 00:42:41,920
I'll die running before
I get on my knees.

412
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,031
I can still see him
drinking with us.

413
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:39,240
Maybe a car will
come by and stop.

414
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,971
Sure, Doris.

415
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:42,780
Maybe a car will pull in.

416
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,220
Supposing a car does
pull in, they won't know.

417
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,951
He'll kill them and us too.

418
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:57,780
The police, maybe the
police will pass by.

419
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,921
They do patrol this highway.

420
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:02,680
They will, Ed.

421
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,340
They will.

422
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,930
Sure they will.

423
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,530
They'll find a way to
make them stop then.

424
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,901
Doris, miracles do happen,
but you can't count on them.

425
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,245
I'm sorry.

426
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:30,841
Now listen.

427
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:33,911
I'm going to try to find out
how many more shots he has left

428
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:35,315
or if he has reloaded or not.

429
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:37,220
But how will we find out?

430
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,440
Four shots we know
of, that leaves four.

431
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,390
He probably shot
the people here too.

432
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:47,120
There must have been two.

433
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,546
Remember what Carl told us about
the settings in the kitchen.

434
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,070
Yes.

435
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,550
Two plates eaten from
and two plates untouched.

436
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,780
Tibbs must have surprised
them while they were eating.

437
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,646
They were to frightened
to eat while those two

438
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,550
were stuffing themselves.

439
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:03,140
If he shot them, that
leaves two shots.

440
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,730
He certainly didn't
walk here from Arizona.

441
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,160
Maybe he shot someone else.

442
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,090
And if he hasn't reloaded...

443
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,805
Go ahead and talk, mister.

444
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:40,530
You talk all you want.

445
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:43,150
You thinking somebody's
going to save you.

446
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,570
Why should I fix the car if
you're going to kill us anyhow?

447
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,770
You'll fix it because
that lets you live

448
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,995
a little longer,
like back there.

449
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:55,120
I know that you were stalling.

450
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,060
If you don't want to fix
the car, you die right now.

451
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,610
You want this car, Tibbs.

452
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,710
Who are you fooling?

453
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,200
Oh, you can kill us,
but you'd be stranded.

454
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,120
That's a road, ain't it?

455
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,200
Where there's a
road, there's cars.

456
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,090
Somebody will pick us up.

457
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:13,320
They always have.

458
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,610
Is that how you got
here from Arizona?

459
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,475
A sailor picked us up.

460
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,240
How far did he take you?

461
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,350
Better than real
love, huh, Judy?

462
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
Suppose you shot him too.

463
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,390
Naw.

464
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,160
I just cut his throat.

465
00:46:31,881 --> 00:46:34,020
Why haven't you
still got his car?

466
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,100
Ran out of gas last night.

467
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,430
You're sure asking a lot
of questions, mister.

468
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,970
But you go ahead and
ask all you want.

469
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,390
How did you get here?

470
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,711
A farmer picked us up.

471
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:51,500
His old crate broke down
up the road a piece.

472
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,350
Too bad.

473
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:56,520
I was beginning to
like that old codger.

474
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,410
Shoot him too?

475
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,731
He sure prayed when he
went, Judy, remember?

476
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:03,610
He reached for the sky and
talked to the Lordy Lord.

477
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,180
Then you shot him.

478
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,681
Yeah.

479
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:12,120
Right between the eyes.

480
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,781
What about the two
people you shot here?

481
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:20,570
Did they pray too?

482
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,560
You must think I'm dumb,
mister, don't know nothing.

483
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:27,720
You're counting bullets.

484
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,245
Count all you want.

485
00:47:32,345 --> 00:47:34,430
I can count too.

486
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:38,360
You know I only fired
seven shots, only got

487
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,350
one bullet left
unless I reloaded.

488
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,221
How many bullets do I have left?

489
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,860
Come on, come on.

490
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,670
You the big man.

491
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,270
Come on.

492
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,460
The one bullet's gone.

493
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,510
Come on, maybe the gun's empty.

494
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,110
Come on, mister.

495
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,140
I'm giving you a chance.

496
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,310
Come on, big man.

497
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,775
Come on, mister.

498
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,740
Come get the gun.

499
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,970
What's the matter, you afraid?

500
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,190
You had a chance, mister.

501
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,845
You should have taken it.

502
00:48:28,945 --> 00:48:31,357
You ain't gonna get no more.

503
00:48:31,457 --> 00:48:33,870
See how yellow they are, Judy?

504
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:37,330
Afraid of an empty gun.

505
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:38,570
Big man.

506
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,311
Big talker.

507
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,720
Push her

508
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,880
Ed, they're getting
ready to do something.

509
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,280
You.

510
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,860
No.

511
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:13,670
The police.

512
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,330
They're coming, Mr. Stiles.

513
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,170
I told you they would.

514
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,070
They will stop.

515
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:21,730
They will.

516
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,290
They will.

517
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:25,020
They're coming after him.

518
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,750
They're coming after you.

519
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,350
You hear me?

520
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,730
You, you, you're not
going to kill anymore!

521
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,630
Doris.

522
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,130
Get in back.

523
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,510
Get in back or I'll
kill you right now.

524
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,710
Do as I say!

525
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,161
Go!

526
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,120
Over there.

527
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,245
Lie down.

528
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:51,270
Lie down!

529
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,290
They're stopping.

530
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,640
Get up.

531
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,020
Get to the car.

532
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,620
Hurry up.

533
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,405
It must be the police.

534
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:22,090
You get in the trunk.

535
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,830
Get in there or I'll
blow your brains out!

536
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,450
One noise and your
lady friend dies.

537
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,040
Keep her out of sight.

538
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,240
She makes one noise,
you slit her throat.

539
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,280
Hi.

540
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,730
Hello, son.

541
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,671
Sure a scorcher.

542
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:36,890
Sure is.

543
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,740
Don't recall having seen
you around here before, son.

544
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,900
Friend of the family.

545
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,581
Just talked to Milt's son
in town about an hour ago.

546
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,520
Funny, being the
talker he is, didn't

547
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,910
mention anything about visitors.

548
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,300
Uh, he just left
before I got in.

549
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,815
Lancaster, huh?

550
00:53:12,915 --> 00:53:14,140
Yeah.

551
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,000
Been working on the car.

552
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:16,980
Fuel pump trouble.

553
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,670
Mine went out only last week.

554
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,210
You know, Jim, it cost
over $30 to get it fixed.

555
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,141
Boy, what a crook that guy was.

556
00:53:29,561 --> 00:53:31,700
Look, somebody lost a 45 clip.

557
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,270
Where is Milt?

558
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,810
Out back someplace.

559
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:56,780
Boy, he can get more parts of a
car than the factory put in it.

560
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,460
Yeah, he sure can.

561
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,565
Help!

562
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:15,452
Help!

563
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:17,891
Help!

564
00:54:19,955 --> 00:54:21,977
Help!

565
00:54:22,077 --> 00:54:23,388
Help!

566
00:54:23,488 --> 00:54:25,300
Help.

567
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:45,810
Get out.

568
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,940
I told you to keep quiet.

569
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,451
Should have done
what I told you.

570
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,580
Get moving.

571
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:49,395
I told you
nobody could help you.

572
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:51,120
You're going to
have every officer

573
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,790
in California looking for you.

574
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:54,860
They don't scare me.

575
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,830
Nobody scares me.

576
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,020
I'm going to give you
a choice, big man.

577
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,930
You die now, or
you fix that car.

578
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,840
I'll give you 15
minutes to fix it.

579
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,810
Why should I fix it?

580
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,570
You'll only kill
us when I get done.

581
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,080
I'm giving you 15 more
minutes of life, mister.

582
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,810
If you don't want it, I'll
blow your head off right now.

583
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,180
Hers too.

584
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,185
It's 1 o'clock.

585
00:56:22,285 --> 00:56:24,092
You got until 1:15.

586
00:56:24,192 --> 00:56:26,000
You start working.

587
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,190
Who would ever believe
something like this?

588
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,380
How could he shoot two officers?

589
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,500
There were two of them.

590
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,940
Two of them.

591
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,550
Judy, give me that gun.

592
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,010
15 minutes.

593
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,591
What are we going to do?

594
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,860
All units, all units,

595
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,170
be on the alert for two Arizona
murder suspects believed to be

596
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:10,020
in California, possibly driving
a green 1958 Ford sedan,

597
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,150
license number Mary
Nora 4-6-9-8-3.

598
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,330
Suspects hitched ride with the
driver of this car, a sailor

599
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,120
en route to San Diego.

600
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,980
The sailor was found murdered
two miles east of Needles

601
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,461
approximately 10:30 this date.

602
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:28,160
Tibbs, Charles A, male
Caucasian, age 20.

603
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,880
Light brown hair, blue eyes.

604
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,681
Height 6'1", Weight
approximately 180 pounds.

605
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:34,561
Fair complexion.

606
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:37,491
Wearing Levi jacket
pants when last seen.

607
00:58:37,591 --> 00:58:42,180
This suspect is armed and to be
considered extremely dangerous.

608
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,810
In company with
suspect number one

609
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,601
is Bradshaw, Judy,
female Caucasian, age 18.

610
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:49,210
Black hair, blue eyes.

611
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,800
Height approximately
5'4", weight

612
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,100
approximately 100 pounds.

613
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,551
Dark complexion.

614
00:58:55,651 --> 00:58:58,370
Wearing a yellow flowered
dress when last seen.

615
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:08,200
If only that radio call had
come two minutes earlier.

616
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,690
We've got to do something.

617
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,641
Looks like we'll
have to run for it.

618
00:59:25,177 --> 00:59:27,980
Move closer.

619
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,500
Get in front of me.

620
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,451
I got an idea.

621
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,971
It may not work, but
at least it's a chance.

622
00:59:37,071 --> 00:59:39,491
It's obvious he doesn't
know much about cars.

623
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:41,630
Now look, when I
get the pump in,

624
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,030
I'll ask you to get in
the car and start it.

625
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,431
Leave it in neutral.

626
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:46,940
I'll race the motor from here.

627
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,810
When I give you the
first signal... uh,

628
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:51,290
I'll scratch my shoulder.

629
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,870
When I do, you shift into drive
and push down on the brake.

630
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:55,570
Got that?

631
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,770
Yes.

632
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,780
When I give you
the second signal...

633
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,710
I'll wink... hold on tight
because I'll be pulling

634
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,680
the gas pedal to the floorboard.

635
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,620
I'm going to try to lure
him in front of the car.

636
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,510
Oh, Ed.

637
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,740
It's just a chance.

638
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,930
We might not hit him, but if
we can at least startle him,

639
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,510
it may give me the
few seconds I need.

640
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,890
Let's just pray this
doesn't kick out on us.

641
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,965
What if it does?

642
01:00:38,065 --> 01:00:40,940
Run for it.

643
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,140
What if he won't let
me get in the car?

644
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,340
It's a chance we'll
just have to take.

645
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,830
You got 11 minutes.

646
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,470
Doris.

647
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,290
Damn it.

648
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,260
I can't fix the car
with you starting it.

649
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:32,990
This is Dick Woods bringing you

650
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,410
music from Dodger
Stadium as we do

651
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,730
every Sunday preceding
the ball game.

652
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,980
Talking about baseball,
those red hot Cincinnati Reds

653
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,090
are in town, riding a
nine-game winning streak.

654
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,200
It's going to be Bob
Purkey going for the Reds

655
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,920
and Sandy Koufax
for the Dodgers.

656
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,820
It should be quite
a pitchers' battle.

657
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,950
There's still plenty of
good seats to be had,

658
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:57,300
so if you're not doing anything,
come out to Dodger Stadium

659
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,541
and see exciting
National League baseball.

660
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:04,405
It's a beautiful
day for a ball game.

661
01:05:04,505 --> 01:05:07,478
Time is 1:10, still
time to come on down.

662
01:05:07,578 --> 01:05:10,551
And now stay tuned
for Dodger warm-ups.

663
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,060
If we could just get them away
from the car long enough to...

664
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,850
Music.

665
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:32,950
All those people laughing
and yelling, so happy.

666
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:41,501
Oh Ed, I don't want to die.

667
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:43,990
I don't want to die.

668
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,590
You're not going to die, Doris.

669
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,931
Four minutes.

670
01:06:12,481 --> 01:06:13,626
Doris, get in the
car and start it

671
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,510
so I can see if the
pump holds pressure.

672
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,371
Doris, get the car and start it.

673
01:06:21,471 --> 01:06:23,251
Just a minute.

674
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:24,210
You want the car to run.

675
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:27,695
I want to live those
extra few minutes.

676
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:31,180
Now I have to check
the pump for pressure.

677
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,410
All right.

678
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:35,280
But it better run good.

679
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:25,580
Start it up.

680
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:39,600
You ain't got much more time.

681
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,360
Two minutes.

682
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,331
How does it feel when
you're about to die?

683
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,300
Try it now.

684
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,820
I think you're yellow belly.

685
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,211
Yeah.

686
01:08:17,311 --> 01:08:18,800
One of them squirmers.

687
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,920
Get out.

688
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,400
I said get out!

689
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:06,480
Move.

690
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:26,960
You must think I'm stupid.

691
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,520
You trying something?

692
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,840
You did something.

693
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,500
I did nothing.

694
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,206
It was running pretty
good a few seconds ago.

695
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,246
You must have did something.

696
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,816
Look, this pump has
been in a wrecked car

697
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,750
for who knows how long.

698
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,100
Now sometimes they get clogged
and don't hold a pressure.

699
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,580
I should take it
out and clean it.

700
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,925
You ain't got time for that.

701
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:00,733
It's not holding pressure.

702
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,441
It needs to be cleaned.

703
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,600
You're out of time, ain'tcha?

704
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,660
It won't take very long.

705
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,120
You ain't taking nothing out!

706
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,500
You think you're
fooling me, don't you?

707
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,170
Think I don't know nothing
about cars, don't you?

708
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,275
That thing right there,
that's a carburetor.

709
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:21,381
The car can't run unless
there's gas in it.

710
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,120
All you gotta do is prime it.

711
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:27,090
Now, I seen that
done, so you prime it.

712
01:11:29,471 --> 01:11:30,070
Well, go on.

713
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:31,670
There's a gas pump over there.

714
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,461
Doris, get in the car and
start it when I tell you to.

715
01:12:03,561 --> 01:12:06,670
Nobody gets in that car but me.

716
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,116
Well, if I'm going
prime it, somebody

717
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,240
has to pump the gas pedal.

718
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,261
Just never you mind.

719
01:12:10,361 --> 01:12:12,010
You just put that gas
in that carburetor.

720
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,270
Charlie!

721
01:13:16,251 --> 01:13:18,740
Oh my god, Judy!

722
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,470
Judy, no.

723
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:35,445
Judy.

724
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:44,371
Judy, Judy, Judy.

725
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,060
I know you're hiding!

726
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,875
I'll find you.

727
01:14:21,975 --> 01:14:23,347
I'll find you.

728
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:25,320
I'll kill you!

729
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,385
Doris, run!

730
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,650
Purkey's out again.

731
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:35,770
Gets the sign,
wind up once more.

732
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,100
Ball low, outside.

733
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:42,470
A curveball just missed the
outside corner, Fairly swung.

734
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,810
Ball one, strike one to Fairly.

735
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:47,770
Say, incidently, there are lots
of good seats here for you fans

736
01:30:47,870 --> 01:30:49,256
to enjoy the Dodgers
and the Redlegs.

737
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,420
If you're close by,
won't you come on down?

738
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,440
You'll enjoy it here at Dodger
Stadium, a gorgeous day.

739
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:57,460
Shirtsleeved crowd, everybody
having a wonderful time.

740
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,100
OK, we're set to go.

741
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,770
The bases loaded, bottom
of the first inning,

742
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,510
Ron Fairly up there, Purkey the
great pitcher of the Redlegs

743
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:06,315
set to go.

744
01:31:06,415 --> 01:31:07,277
He faces in.

745
01:31:07,377 --> 01:31:08,140
He has his sign.

746
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,680
There's the wind up, the pitch.

747
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:11,480
Fairly belts it.

748
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,580
Oh, what a smash.

749
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:14,550
Frank Robinson

750
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:16,981
is He's going
back. races

751
01:31:17,081 --> 01:31:18,081
towards the wall.

752
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,981
Back, back, back, he goes.

753
01:31:20,081 --> 01:31:21,930
Oh, it's a home run!
