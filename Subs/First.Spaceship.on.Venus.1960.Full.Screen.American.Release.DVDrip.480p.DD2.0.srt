1
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:13,655
In 1985, during
the course of the

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,303
work undertaken to
irrigate the Gobi desert.

3
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:19,489
A strange fragment
of rock was discovered.

4
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,644
Several remarkable features
of this rock attracted the

5
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,282
attention of the scientists
engaged on the project.

6
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:28,669
Research revealed
that it contained a spool.

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Further analysis

8
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,500
showed the material to
be extraterrestrial in origin,

9
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,593
and not of human manufacture.

10
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:40,307
Where did it come from?

11
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:48,851
Then, somebody remembered
that in June 1908, in Siberia,

12
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,889
an explosion had occurred
equivalent in force to a hydrogen bomb.

13
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,142
An explosion visible
within a radius of 350 miles.

14
00:01:57,744 --> 00:02:01,170
At the time it was thought to have
been caused by a giant meteor.

15
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,499
Seventy seven years later,

16
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,799
an international
expedition tried to determine

17
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:07,650
the trajectory and
the point of impact,

18
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:11,556
and to find some debris of what
was called the Tongu meteor.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,040
Shortly afterwards, under the auspices of
the World Federation for Space Research,

20
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:20,102
scientist meet to celebrate
the anniversary of the

21
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:22,683
establishment of the first
space station on the moon.

22
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:25,341
Professor Harringway,
from the United States

23
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,189
makes a public statement
about the famous meteor.

24
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:34,633
Our calculations indicate,

25
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,960
confirmed also by the results
recently transmitted to us

26
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,851
by our colleagues on Luna 3,

27
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:43,440
that the mysterious Tongu
meteor was really a spaceship

28
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,498
from another planet,

29
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,150
which exploded in
the air before landing.

30
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,718
This hypothesis stimulated
scientific thought throughout the world.

31
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,761
Reporters of every
nation are waiting to hear

32
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:58,888
what the nuclear physicist
Professor Orloff has to say.

33
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,657
Professor Orloff, is this another
hoax of the flying saucer variety?

34
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:09,917
And what about this spool
that was found in the desert

35
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:12,256
some 350 miles from
the crater of the explosion.

36
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,035
How do you explain
that, Professor Orloff?

37
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,124
Oh, I believe there
was a grave emergency.

38
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:20,170
When the rockets, normally used
for deceleration, refused to function

39
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,956
the captain of the spaceship
decided to save what he considered

40
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,770
was most valuable.

41
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,288
I'm referring naturally to
the spool which may contain

42
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:29,872
a document of prime importance
in an unknown language.

43
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,079
Recorded apparently
by a magnetic process.

44
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,321
An international
committee of expert linguists

45
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,326
was offered access to the
world's largest computer,

46
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:43,200
to try to decipher
this strange language.

47
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,419
This is Dr. Tchen Yu.

48
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,256
Not only is he one of the world's
leading authorities on languages,

49
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,600
but also his biological work
is of immense importance.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,121
Humanity is in debt to
him for the technique of

51
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:05,150
transforming inorganic
substances into foodstuffs.

52
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,635
He directs the
committee with world

53
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,288
famous mathematician
Professor Sikarna,

54
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,760
whose work rivals
even that of Einstein.

55
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,467
In the astrophysical domain
we've made rapid progress,

56
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,032
and although we haven't
deciphered the mysterious

57
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:22,464
message, we have determined
the ship's launching base.

58
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:25,259
At the moment there
can be no doubt.

59
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,122
This spaceship

60
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,573
was launched within our
solar system, I can even say

61
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:34,207
that it was definitely launched
from within the path of our planet.

62
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,308
Now, since there can
be no life on Mercury,

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,380
there is only one other planet
that it could have come from.

64
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,120
I am referring to the
Earth's sister planet,

65
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,101
Venus, the morning star.

66
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,356
Listen!

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,560
The elements existing on Earth.

68
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:21,830
That's right.

69
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:25,816
It certainly is a chemical physical
analysis of the atmosphere and

70
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,914
What's that, sir?

71
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:51,360
What we have just heard
are the first words of the

72
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,742
inhabitants of another
planet, a cosmic document.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,140
Yes.

74
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,256
Yes, but

75
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,260
it's unfortunate that the
magnetic spool was damaged

76
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,172
through the effect of
the high temperature

77
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,890
which prevailed aboard the cosmic
vessel at the time of the crash.

78
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,979
That's the reason we've
only heard a part of the text.

79
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:18,492
We must try to find a
method to renovate the rest.

80
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:22,053
First we'll immerse the
spool in a chemical catalytical

81
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:25,053
medium, and after that,
subject it to radiation.

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,815
Tchen Yu.

83
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:29,389
Yes, that's a very good idea.

84
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,975
All that we have
learned indicates that on

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,215
Venus there is a highly
developed life form.

86
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,373
Yet, I'm wondering
why Venus stays silent.

87
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,691
It's very surprising.

88
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:43,390
Now we know a
little of this language.

89
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,110
We must,

90
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,231
at every cost,
communicate with her.

91
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:50,077
I agree with you. It's high
time we made an attempt.

92
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,517
Well then, I'd like to
propose a course of action.

93
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,740
I think the most
logical thing to do,

94
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,755
would be to request
that our government's

95
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,432
consent to train all the
radio and radar stations

96
00:07:01,457 --> 00:07:02,852
of the world on Venus.

97
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,797
Polar station calling Moon
space station, attention please.

98
00:07:22,044 --> 00:07:23,157
Luna 3.

99
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,129
Attention please, Luna 3.

100
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,180
Thank you.

101
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,857
<i>This is station Luna 3.</i>

102
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:31,938
I'll keep it in mind.

103
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:34,223
<i>Station Luna 3 calling Earth.</i>

104
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:36,151
No replies yet from Venus.

105
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,529
Our signals are reaching the
planet, but so far there's no reply.

106
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,022
We'll keep you informed.

107
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,943
- Good morning, my friends.
- May I please have an interview?

108
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,650
This afternoon I have news of
the utmost importance to announce.

109
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,376
As you probably know already,

110
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:02,913
our most modern spaceship,
the Cosmostrator, is now

111
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:05,890
completed, and ready to set
forth on our exploration of space.

112
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,739
The World Federation for
Space Research has decided

113
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:11,165
to change the destination
of the Cosmostrator.

114
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:13,414
Instead of sending her to
Mars, she will be directed

115
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,955
toward the planet Venus.

116
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,810
Oh, that's great news, isn't it?

117
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:18,755
Have you any idea as to
the date of the take-off?

118
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,717
One more question if
you don't mind, professor.

119
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,502
Do you think there's
anybody living on Venus?

120
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,167
Did you manage to
make contact with Venus?

121
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:27,799
No, my friends, Venus is
silent, but we'll soon discover why.

122
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:29,599
And who's going with you?

123
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,594
Well, let me present
some of the other

124
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,548
scientists who will take
part in this expedition.

125
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,800
They are all
first-class specialists.

126
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,950
Chosen from among the most
qualified in their particular fields.

127
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:42,433
They, with others who are coming,
will form the crew of Cosmostrator 1.

128
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,870
Well, all the units of propulsion
are in perfect working order.

129
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,750
Well, that's fine. The crew can
now attend to their personal affairs.

130
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,485
We'll start late tomorrow night.

131
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,698
We'll fly following the
hyperbolic trajectory.

132
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,332
- Good, I'll make a last check.
- See you later, Durand.

133
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,030
Talua.

134
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:17,664
Will you please make a
thorough recheck of the radar.

135
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,801
Right away, professor.

136
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,043
This is Intervision calling the world.

137
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,789
We have just showed you the preliminary
tests of the Cosmostrator's rockets.

138
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,819
Arriving now is Brinkmann.

139
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:31,673
The first Amercan spaceman
to land on the Moon.

140
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:39,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

141
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,856
I have an important
announcement to make.

142
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,423
Intervision is going to
present you minute by minute,

143
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,790
the historic launching of
the Cosmostrator.

144
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:49,756
We know very well how much
you'd like to be here with us.

145
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:51,642
Unfortunately, that's impossible.

146
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:54,425
The only ones admitted
are those directly concerned

147
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,670
with the countdown and
final blastoff of the rocket.

148
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,604
So I will try to describe in detail
everything that's taking place.

149
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:03,652
Intervision will bring to you the
wonderful story of this great event.

150
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:07,233
Ah, but here come the
first members of the crew.

151
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:11,140
Among them is Professor
Durand, the chief engineer.

152
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,427
He's a French scientist, well
known for his work on robots.

153
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,572
We'll load the Crawlercopter
later on in the evening.

155
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:21,218
That's of course if it's alright
with you. - Yes, of course.

156
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,285
I've checked out your
electronic equipment. - Good.

157
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,556
Professor Durand,
report from Station A,

158
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,716
- your celestial charts are ready.
- Thank you.

159
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:36,706
Hello, Durand.

160
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:39,600
- Oh, Durand, I'm glad to see you again.
- So am I.

161
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,773
Still working as hard?

162
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:43,081
How about showing me
your latest creation in robots,

163
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:44,346
I hear it's a masterpiece.

164
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,639
Around here we have
nothing but masterpieces.

165
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:48,320
Omega.

166
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,793
Come here, Omega.

167
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,913
Omega, what's the weather
report for the next 10 hours?

168
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,590
The barometer will rise 4 millibars.

169
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:16,467
Four millibars, [??] and clear.

170
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:17,867
Well, that's fantastic.

171
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,556
- Your latest invention?
- Oh, nothing special.

172
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,130
- Just a small gadget.
- You're a lot too modest, Durand.

173
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,614
What else does it do?

174
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,730
He reacts to stimuli
in his environment,

175
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,814
evaluates them with
his electronic brain.

176
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:34,161
I recently managed to give
Omega an elementary memory.

177
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:35,763
Wonderful.

178
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:38,903
Perhaps he might consent
to play chess with me.

179
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,446
Why of course. Why shouldn't he?

180
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,547
Oh, Harringway.

181
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,398
The specially picked crew of the
Cosmostrator have reached Urania.

182
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:50,546
Eight of them, scientists,
mathematicians, and astrophysicists.

183
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,272
Seven men, and

184
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:54,855
and a woman.

185
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,408
She's the physician
of the expedition,

186
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:59,042
and has already spent
two years on Luna 3.

187
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,582
Sumiko.

188
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:02,715
Brinkmann.

189
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,737
Have I changed that much?

190
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:13,006
I don't know. I've got it! Your hair
used to hang down to your waist.

191
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,506
- Mr. Brinkmann.
- Yes.

192
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:16,414
- You forgot this.
- Oh, thank you.

193
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:20,488
Robert Brinkmann.

194
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,781
The man who's always
forgetting something.

195
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
I have a reputation for that.

196
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,220
You're right.

197
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,019
But there are things
I'll never forget.

198
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,190
No, Brinkmann.

199
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,438
On a voyage of this kind,

200
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,891
there'll be no room
for excess baggage.

201
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,437
Dr. Sumiko Ogimura.

202
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,163
Thirty hours left.

203
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:45,016
Thirty hours and the
Cosmostrator will blastoff

204
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,350
into the unknown.

205
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:48,882
Now we will leave the air.

206
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:52,229
In the next few hours the crew
of 8 picked for the Cosmostrator

207
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,569
will be unable to
communicate with the world.

208
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:57,596
They are going into a
state of artificially induced

209
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,935
sleep till the time comes
for them to take off.

210
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:02,033
This is to make sure
that they will be in good

211
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,973
physical condition
for the effort to come.

212
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:06,092
This is Intervision.

213
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,560
Good afternoon.

214
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,546
Brinkmann.

215
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,208
In 2 minutes you'll be asleep

216
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,666
like all your kind.

217
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,610
Whether you want to or not.

218
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,260
You'll be able to see
and hear your heart.

219
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,778
I'm very glad you're
coming with us, Sumiko.

220
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,226
That way, I'll be near you.

221
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:48,823
Your heartbeat is normal.

222
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,978
Sumiko.

223
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:52,898
My heart is...

224
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:54,478
No, Brinkmann, no.

225
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,404
No, please, we mustn't
speak of that, ever.

226
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,556
Goodnight, Robert.

227
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,202
It's time for you to
sleep too, Dr. Sumiko.

228
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:15,355
Yes, you're right.

229
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,618
This is Intervision.

230
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:43,097
Intervision calling the world.

231
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,278
It won't be long now
until the blastoff.

232
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:50,473
Tension is mounting among the
scientists and technicians on the base

233
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:52,741
as zero hour approaches.

234
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,430
Everything is ready.

235
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,256
All we're waiting
for is the crew.

236
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:01,865
And here they are.

237
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,320
Interviews of the
crew are finished.

238
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,830
They are now boarding the vehicles
which will take them to the Cosmostrator.

239
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:35,256
Time check.

240
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:37,004
Fifty one.

241
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,100
Fifty two.

242
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:40,600
Fifty three.

243
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:42,160
Fifty four.

244
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,570
Fifty five.

245
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:45,010
Fifty six.

246
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,870
Fifty seven.

247
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,470
Fifty eight.

248
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,116
Fifty nine.

249
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,000
Sixty.

250
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,050
Okay.

251
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:55,268
Rockets primed,
ready for blastoff.

252
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,573
Breathe calmly.

253
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:02,080
Relax.

254
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,327
Don't tense up.

255
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:06,186
Ignition system ready.

256
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,270
Ten seconds.

257
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,390
Nine.

258
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:11,749
Eight.

259
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
Seven.

260
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,770
Six.

261
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,970
Five.

262
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:17,631
- Four.
- Stand by.

263
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:18,831
Three.

264
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,290
Two.

265
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,504
One.

266
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:22,843
Zero.

267
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,903
Luna 3 calling Urania, have
Cosmostrator on our radar screens.

268
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,310
Appearance normal.

269
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:14,253
Feeling alright?
No ill effects, huh?

270
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,469
Riding the clouds.

271
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,749
At over second cosmic velocity,
we've left them way behind us.

272
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:26,100
I'm going to loosen this
belt, it's uncomfortable.

273
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:33,284
Hey, be careful. Don't forget there's
no gravity. We're in free fall now.

274
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:01,751
Durand,

275
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:04,311
switch on the artificial
gravity field, will you?

276
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:10,199
Orloff, careful.

277
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:12,087
I'm pushing the button.

278
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,258
That was a dirty trick.

279
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,851
Cosmostrator calling Luna 3.

280
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,763
Come in, Luna 3.

281
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:41,610
This is Luna 3.

282
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,640
We are receiving you well.

283
00:18:43,816 --> 00:18:45,022
Over and out.

284
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:47,389
Hello, Luna 3, we
hear you loud and clear.

285
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,973
Minus two.

286
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,700
Plus five.

287
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:53,793
Course normal.
Course normal.

288
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,169
Our course is exactly
hyperbolic, no deviation.

289
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:58,546
We are passing within
1200 miles of you.

290
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:02,560
This is Luna 3, we have
established visual contact with you.

291
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,756
That's the Sinus Roris crater.

292
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:09,045
On the top of it is Luna 3.

293
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,936
There's the solar reflector.

294
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:15,963
They're signaling us.

295
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:26,859
That's where her husband fell.

296
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:31,072
I brought him back to the
camp, but he was already dead.

297
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,231
We were friends.

298
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:35,818
You know,

299
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,265
Sumiko is a wonderful women.

300
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,765
This is luna 3.

301
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,948
Have picked up unexpected
swarms of meteorites on our radar.

302
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,235
Their present trajectory
shows that they may

303
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,529
cross your path and
be very dangerous.

304
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,041
We are receiving you. Over.

305
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,205
Here are the trajectory
coordinates and orbital velocity.

306
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,910
Alpha X, seven degrees

307
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,006
two minutes.

308
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,439
Beta epsilon.

309
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,764
Forty eight degrees

310
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,060
forty two minutes.

311
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,768
Listen, I've had an
extremely urgent message

312
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:09,013
from Luna 3, a
meteorite warning.

313
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:16,143
Professor Sikarna, here's
the latest meteorite report.

314
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,386
Alpha X, 7 degrees, 2 minutes.

315
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:24,437
Beta Epsilon, 48
degrees, 42 minutes.

316
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:29,462
A meteorite swarm should
reach us in 48 hours at the latest.

317
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,620
That is if there are
no orbit fluctuations.

318
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,317
Keep close radio
contact with Luna 3.

319
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:39,720
Cosmostrator calling Luna 3, have
received your meteorite warning,

320
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:43,430
will be sending you regular coordinates
of our course, so stay in close contact.

321
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,767
This is the beginning
of my personal logbook.

322
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:55,170
There's no one in the nerve
center of the Cosmostrator.

323
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,474
The computer is
keeping us on our course.

324
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,690
In case of unforeseen
circumstances,

325
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,914
it can take immediate
decisions to alter our speed

326
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:06,047
or direction.

327
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,850
This electronic
brain will be our pilot

328
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:10,221
for the next 30 days.

329
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,055
Because no human being
could handle the immensely

330
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,844
complex machines of
the spaceship by himself.

331
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:17,635
Up to now,

332
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,800
we have covered a
distance of two million

333
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,853
six hundred thousand miles.

334
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,479
Doctor Ogimura is noting
our reactions carefully,

335
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,118
and keeping close check
on our health and well-being.

336
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:32,534
The special liquid food which can easily
be absorbed in a state of no gravity,

337
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,110
is proving very
successful with all of us.

338
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,157
Our chief engineer spends most
of his time in his machine shop,

339
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,832
testing his automates
over and over again.

340
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:50,796
It is thanks to them,

341
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,296
and to the fact that they
are in perfect running order,

342
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,893
that we are relieved
of many tiresome tasks.

343
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:00,737
Our expert in cybernetics
has to be everywhere.

344
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,595
He's one of the key
men of the expedition.

345
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:11,017
Professor Sikarna devotes all his
time to the message from Venus.

346
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,121
He and Tchen Yu are trying
to decipher the damaged spool,

347
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:16,746
which means they spend
long hours at the Marax.

348
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,806
The electronic brain is
working night and day,

349
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:22,246
but no one can be sure
what the result will be.

350
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:34,410
Harringway, our commander, is
keeping a constant check on our course.

351
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:37,542
Your computer
was active last night.

352
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:41,365
It switched the rockets
on for nearly 17 seconds.

353
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:44,853
Perhaps to avoid
the meteor swarm.

354
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,540
We won't be running
into it till tomorrow.

355
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,902
It looks like your automats

356
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:52,436
don't have the same
idea that you do.

357
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:58,818
Professor Orloff is an
enthusiastic chess player.

358
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:03,632
It has beaten all of us, but I think
he's found his master in Omega.

359
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:08,143
King-G8.

360
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:16,752
King-E6.

361
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:22,789
It's amazing.

362
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,430
He plays his
endgame wonderfully.

363
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:29,546
I thought that I had got him, but
you see he's put his king on E6.

364
00:23:30,062 --> 00:23:32,115
And I'm forced into
the corner at H8.

365
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:44,313
King-E7.

366
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:47,431
Check mate next move.

367
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:59,843
That is the tenth
match that I've lost.

368
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:01,596
I should give up, I guess.

369
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,902
I would suggest that you
make an improvement in Omega.

370
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:06,470
Oh, really.

371
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,786
If he only had a heart,

372
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,513
he would let Orloff
win once in a while.

373
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:14,803
Don't you think you
could be able to do that?

374
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,863
Just a little bit
of heart, Durand.

375
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,609
Meteorites!

376
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:44,508
Brinkmann, switch on
the emergency gyros!

377
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:21,478
Brinkmann, see if Tchen Yu
and Sikarna are alright.

378
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,077
How could this happen?

379
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:33,286
I thought that the
Cosmostrator was

380
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,579
able to avoid meteor
swarms, automatically.

381
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:38,225
Well, she didn't react
quickly enough,

382
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,335
she was regulated to a
shower of under mass 8.

383
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,956
That was why we had to
switch on the emergency gyros.

384
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:49,746
Orloff.

385
00:25:50,072 --> 00:25:51,559
How much course deviation?

386
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:00,135
Twelve degrees.

387
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:02,269
Seventeen minutes.

388
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,515
Our speed?

389
00:26:03,756 --> 00:26:06,111
Constant, 8.2 miles a second.

390
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,887
I estimate the principal
swarm will be on us soon.

391
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:14,089
If we continue at maximum
speed, it'll mean disaster.

392
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,169
Cut the motors!

393
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:18,191
We're going to decelerate.

394
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:25,123
The braking motors
aren't working.

395
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,523
What's the matter, Durand?

396
00:26:34,907 --> 00:26:37,727
A meteor fragment has
damaged the deceleration unit.

397
00:26:38,177 --> 00:26:40,650
We'll have to go outside and
try and repair it, right away.

398
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:42,457
I'll go at once.

399
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,616
How long before the
main swarm hits us?

400
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,130
I can't say, it may be
on us any second now.

401
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:48,896
Brinkmann, will you help me?

402
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,993
Professor Sikarna,
Tchen Yu, are you alright?

403
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:53,260
No bones broken.

404
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,584
That's fine.

405
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:56,528
Please give me our
present deviation,

406
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:58,873
direction coordinates,
and corrected course.

407
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:54,571
Watch out.

408
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:56,398
Everybody fasten your belts.

409
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:08,326
Stand by.

410
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,814
The principal swarm's in sight.

411
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,647
Is it safe to start
the motors yet?

412
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:21,270
Repair is completed.

413
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:22,584
Durand's back.

414
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,352
Cosmostrator calling Luna 3.

415
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:35,347
Cosmostrator calling Luna 3.

416
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,086
The meteor swarm has past.

417
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,033
Everything okay on board.

418
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:54,798
Three weeks have gone
by since we left the Earth.

419
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:57,179
We should reach
Venus in about ten days.

420
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,378
In spite of our enormous speed,

421
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:01,418
the stars seem to
hang motionless.

422
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,190
Due to all types of disturbances
caused by the planet,

423
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:06,488
radio contact with Earth
is no longer possible.

424
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:07,804
Nothing.

425
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:09,097
Too much interference.

426
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,630
I can't hear a thing.

427
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,003
Keep trying.

428
00:29:15,594 --> 00:29:16,840
Alpha X.

429
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:18,834
Thirty two degrees,
eight minutes.

430
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,267
Beta Y.

431
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:21,613
Seven degrees.

432
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:27,665
What are you doing.

433
00:29:29,178 --> 00:29:31,142
I'm making a heart for Omega.

434
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:34,845
Ten consecutive defeats
are driving our friend crazy.

435
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:37,212
I want him to enjoy
his favorite game.

436
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:40,251
I would like you to do
something also for me.

437
00:29:40,376 --> 00:29:42,518
It would be nice to see
you eat occasionally.

438
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,005
I swear not to forget anymore.

439
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:48,098
Sikarna said exactly
the same thing.

440
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,191
Professor.

441
00:29:58,385 --> 00:29:59,598
What do you want?

442
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,250
No, please, not now!

443
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:05,924
Your health is
my responsibility,

444
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,429
and you haven't eaten for days.

445
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,256
I haven't a second to spare.

446
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:23,138
Sumiko.

447
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:27,594
You mustn't insist.
He's nervous.

448
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:29,622
He's having a very
hard time with that spool.

449
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:30,842
You understand.

450
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:40,485
Knight-E6.

451
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,262
Check.

452
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:50,168
He doesn't like that.

453
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,755
King-B8.

454
00:30:58,634 --> 00:30:59,694
Mate!

455
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:01,511
Congratulations.

456
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,417
You've won at last.

457
00:31:05,011 --> 00:31:06,672
A neat classical end play.

458
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:08,118
I think you deserve to win.

459
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,582
He plays a good game,
he's not very easy to beat.

460
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:15,011
But I did it at last.

461
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:16,624
Man has defeated the machine.

462
00:31:16,922 --> 00:31:18,702
Yeah, too much heart.

463
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:22,232
- Want to try?
- Why not?

464
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:24,066
Will you all come to
the Marax, please?

465
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:27,815
Perhaps it's the
cosmic document.

466
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:42,816
We have finally deciphered
the last part of the spool.

467
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:45,431
It gives complete meaning
to the cosmic document.

468
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,692
I will translate.

469
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,852
We will initially
subject the planet to

470
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:17,538
a very intense
bombardment of radiation.

471
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:21,874
The conquest and occupation of
the Earth will then present no difficulty.

472
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,496
When the ionization
intensity has fallen by one half,

473
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,048
the final extermination
phase can start.

474
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,095
This can only mean,

475
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,721
an attack, against are planet.

476
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:36,595
An invasion by the
inhabitants of Venus.

477
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:40,171
The cosmic document was
not intended for us to read.

478
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,898
It's a cold blooded
blueprint of destruction.

479
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,392
We must inform the Earth!

480
00:32:44,432 --> 00:32:45,865
I'll try and make contact!

481
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:48,435
- Wait, Talua!
- No, let him try.

482
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:51,422
Will it do the Earth any good
to know what we know?

483
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:53,559
The Earth is in danger,
we must warn them!

484
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:55,781
No.

485
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,485
Our planet was in peril before they
discovered the spool and nothing happened.

486
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:03,195
That's no argument, as we haven't
any idea how the Venusians

487
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:04,564
calculate time.

488
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:07,425
If the Earth knew of the
terrible danger threatening her.

489
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,643
Unrest and even hysteria

490
00:33:09,776 --> 00:33:11,463
would spread like wildfire.

491
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:14,831
From pole to pole the whole
world would be in a panic.

492
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,218
No.

493
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:19,396
No, Orloff.

494
00:33:19,753 --> 00:33:21,239
I'm convinced you're wrong.

495
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:24,531
For years and years
the whole of the human

496
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:26,672
race faced the danger
of an atomic war. -Yes.

497
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:28,170
And they survived.

498
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,928
Not through ignorance,
but through knowledge.

499
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,128
Because they knew
what the danger was.

500
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:37,151
No.

501
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:39,004
There won't be a panic.

502
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:42,152
Tchen Yu, don't
you agree with me?

503
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:46,442
I'm sure that if we meet
the inhabitants of Venus,

504
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:48,722
we'll be able to
convince them

505
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:50,702
that it will be folly
to start that war.

506
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:52,328
Talua!

507
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:53,642
Try to contact the Earth.

508
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,640
I can't get through, too
much disturbance from Venus.

509
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:00,584
Our signals are distorted.

510
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,573
The Earth won't hear us.

511
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:11,747
Well, what do you say?

512
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,561
Should we turn back to Earth.

513
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:17,949
No.

514
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:22,249
Ach! Nonsense.

515
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:27,279
Return?

516
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:28,586
No.

517
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,495
Never.

518
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:39,648
Uh-uh.

519
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,013
Durand, our speed?

520
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:48,653
Thirty one thousand
miles per hour.

521
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,209
- In 3 days we'll reach Venus.
- Good.

522
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,802
Talua, check our course.

523
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,642
Orloff.

524
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,243
The latest readings.

525
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,503
Gamma radiation
increasing steadily.

526
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:00,156
I'll recheck the neutron count.

527
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,492
Five thousand miles.

528
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:14,192
After only 31 days of flight, we
have nearly reached our destination.

529
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,486
All our efforts to
communicate with the Earth

530
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,545
via Luna 3 have
been unsuccessful.

531
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:22,361
We have started to decelerate
by means of our rocket motors.

532
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:24,365
Professor Harringway
is guiding the ship

533
00:35:24,502 --> 00:35:26,475
into an elliptical orbit
around Venus.

534
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,505
We are now a satellite
of this silent planet.

535
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,953
We are still
trying, but in vain,

536
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:34,792
to establish radio contact
with her inhabitants.

537
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,460
A thick wall of clouds
surrounds the planet.

538
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:42,178
Three thousand
five hundred miles.

539
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,532
First analysis Venus atmosphere:

540
00:35:45,732 --> 00:35:47,732
Twenty seven
percent carbon dioxide,

541
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,718
Fourteen percent, formaldehyde.

542
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:53,512
No oxygen. Atmosphere poisonous.

543
00:35:54,973 --> 00:35:56,833
Now, we're faced
with a difficult decision.

544
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,932
As you know, we can
only land and take off once.

545
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:02,805
No point in taking any
unnecessary chances.

546
00:36:03,431 --> 00:36:05,484
So one of us has got
to go ahead as scout.

547
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:06,497
2,000 miles.

548
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:08,884
We're close enough now,
I'll go in the Crawlercopter.

549
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:10,752
Okay, Brinkmann.

550
00:36:11,312 --> 00:36:13,672
You've got to try and
find a landing place for us.

551
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:17,174
We'll stay in orbit at 150
miles altitude, alright?

552
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,405
The Crawlercopter's ready.

553
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,265
One thousand five hundred miles.

554
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,140
- Well.
- Now, let's don't be formal.

555
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:33,996
Action stations!

556
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:35,969
Action stations, everyone!

557
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:43,752
Seven hundred and fifty miles.

558
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:45,532
Stand by.

559
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:48,413
We are now entering
the atmosphere of Venus.

560
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:49,513
Attention!

561
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:13,923
We're flying at
300 miles altitude.

562
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:17,410
Present speed is
4.3 miles a second.

563
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:20,277
Are you ready, Brinkmann?

564
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,004
Alright, let her go.

565
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:31,447
Release!

566
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,146
Brinkmann, hello!

567
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:50,780
Hello, Brinkmann.

568
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:51,866
Hello.

569
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,378
What's the matter
with his receiver?!

570
00:37:54,512 --> 00:37:55,692
I'm not getting you.

571
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:59,345
There's something wrong with
your receiver, can you hear me now?

572
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:02,329
I can't understand you, something's
wrong with your transmitter.

573
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:05,380
Talua, what's the matter
with our transmitter?

574
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:06,909
Heavy electrical disturbance.

575
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:08,622
We're completely blocked out.

576
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,788
Hello.

577
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:11,812
Brinkmann!

578
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:13,429
What is it, Brinkmann?

579
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:16,517
Harringway, can you hear me?

580
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,772
I'm now at 1500
feet, visibility nil.

581
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:26,397
Radar indicates that the
surface is extremely mountainous.

582
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,070
I can't see anything, I'm completely
surrounded by thick clouds.

583
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:34,584
Wait a minute.
Yes! I can see land.

584
00:38:35,024 --> 00:38:36,291
I can see land!

585
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:44,038
Hello! Hello!

586
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,392
Cosmostrator, I can't hear you!

587
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,804
I'm landing. Here she goes!

588
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:57,257
Brinkmann is not receiving us.
I can't make contact.

589
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:01,010
Our altitude?

590
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,823
Twenty four thousand feet.

591
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,565
Omega, you take the lead.

592
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,055
Go on.

593
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:44,645
I'm right behind you.

594
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:52,552
I don't understand.

595
00:39:53,198 --> 00:39:56,544
I'm puzzled by these strange flashes
of light which we keep seeing.

596
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,637
They're bursting all around us.

597
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:02,751
What do you make
of them, Orloff?

598
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:04,464
In my opinion,

599
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:07,074
the atmosphere in
this area is ionized.

600
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,391
- But what's the cause?
- Atomic radiation!

601
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:11,987
Then that means that
they're attacking us.

602
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:13,814
And Brinkmann!

603
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,474
We must fly lower.

604
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,635
We must get below
this bank of clouds

605
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:20,868
if we want to establish
contact with Brinkmann.

606
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,220
It's the only way.

607
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,180
Brinkmann calling Cosmostrator,
please answer me, over.

608
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:32,513
Omega.

609
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:35,699
Hello. Answer me.

610
00:40:38,022 --> 00:40:39,781
Be careful!

611
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,135
Danger!

612
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:43,199
Go on, Omega.

613
00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:44,653
Intense

614
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,600
radiation.

615
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:49,488
Eight curries.

616
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:51,308
How long can we stay here?

617
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:56,295
Eight minutes maximum.

618
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:57,746
Turn back, Omega.

619
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:06,234
Cosmostrator.

620
00:41:06,307 --> 00:41:07,554
Cosmostrator!

621
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,334
I don't hear you!

622
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,796
Hello! Hello!

623
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:14,716
You hear me?

624
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:18,999
This blasted radioactive forest
won't let radio waves through.

625
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:21,652
Go on, Omega.

626
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:22,732
Go on.

627
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:25,845
Keep going.

628
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:28,771
Keep on!

629
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:38,291
Hold it, Omega.
They're attacking us.

630
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:40,406
Cosmostrator!

631
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,493
Cosmostrator!

632
00:41:41,518 --> 00:41:42,593
Do you hear me?!

633
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:44,447
The Crawlercopter's exploded!

634
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:46,470
A flash!

635
00:41:48,776 --> 00:41:49,823
Did you see that?

636
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,090
What was it?

637
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:52,794
I don't know.

638
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:55,768
The computer shows a pressure
wave, apparently an explosion.

639
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:58,184
Distance, 120 miles.

640
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,487
Brinkmann.

641
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:04,307
Or, it could be a signal
from the Venusians.

642
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,152
We'd better land at
once as best we can.

643
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:09,439
Talua,

644
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:11,251
make a careful
check on our position.

645
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,271
And try to contact
Brinkmann again.

646
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,887
Omega, back here, quickly!

647
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:06,567
Stand by.

648
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:07,606
Deceleration rockets.

649
00:43:07,631 --> 00:43:08,528
Thrust.

650
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:09,540
18.

651
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:10,622
21.

652
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:11,671
24.

653
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:13,451
27.

654
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:14,812
30.

655
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,380
His Crawlercopter exploded.

656
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,277
Poor old Brinkmann.

657
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:10,219
There's the cause.

658
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:12,112
There's a high tension
line underground.

659
00:44:12,137 --> 00:44:14,136
Durand, get the
crawlers out of the way,

660
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,763
or the next time
the voltage mounts

661
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,689
exactly the same
thing will happen to us.

662
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,728
Omega!

663
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,928
Brinkmann, we
thought you were dead!

664
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:39,228
Ha ha, I was lucky.

665
00:44:39,281 --> 00:44:41,381
You might have chosen
a better place to land.

666
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:42,434
Why, what do you mean?

667
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:44,205
There's a high
tension line over there.

668
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,960
Now, your machine blew
up just because you landed

669
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,940
right on top of that
surface power line.

670
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:51,048
All we have to
do is to follow it,

671
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:53,751
and it will probably lead us
to the inhabitants of Venus.

672
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:56,771
There's no point
in trying to do that.

673
00:44:57,138 --> 00:44:59,038
I've already found the
inhabitants of Venus.

674
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:01,651
And I've brought one
of them back for you.

675
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:07,725
What is it?

676
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:11,122
I wonder if it
is a form of life.

677
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,207
I'll investigate at once.

678
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:18,107
Alright, Tchen Yu.

679
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:19,787
And while he's doing that

680
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,667
let's go and try
to follow that line.

681
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:22,825
Okay.

682
00:45:33,593 --> 00:45:34,606
Omega.

683
00:45:34,686 --> 00:45:35,686
Come on.

684
00:45:45,885 --> 00:45:47,412
Crawler, please come in.

685
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:48,999
Crawler, please come in.

686
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,514
We're following the power line.

687
00:45:51,927 --> 00:45:53,547
Something very strange here.

688
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:55,495
A white sphere
that looks like a

689
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:57,228
an immense golf ball.

690
00:46:06,321 --> 00:46:07,536
It's incredible!

691
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:09,534
Do you think it's
a machine, Orloff?

692
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:11,281
Well, I can't say yet.

693
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:13,306
I don't know.

694
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:15,243
Everything here is so strange.

695
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:19,462
It's as if we're trying to decipher
a book in an unknown language.

696
00:46:20,008 --> 00:46:22,208
Let's hope that soon
we'll be able to read it.

697
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:25,939
Then perhaps we'll understand.

698
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,771
Orloff, let me know when
you've got your instruments ready.

699
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:31,638
I'll need all the
figures I can get.

700
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,022
Okay, Sikarna.

701
00:46:33,513 --> 00:46:35,133
Good. Thank you.

702
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:36,860
Talua, stay in close
contact with us.

703
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:38,065
Very well, professor.

704
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:44,110
I am looking at Venus on the
observation screen of the Cosmostrator.

705
00:46:44,726 --> 00:46:46,439
Everything is strangely quiet.

706
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:48,417
Is this the calm
before the storm?

707
00:46:49,046 --> 00:46:51,057
Why don't the Venusians answer?

708
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,077
Or are these metallic insects
really the masters of this planet?

709
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:58,105
Tchen Yu is
working day and night

710
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,784
to solve the mystery of
these strange creatures.

711
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:25,309
We have investigated
your strange inhabitants.

712
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:26,846
They're completely harmless.

713
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:28,389
They're not a form of life.

714
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:30,549
When I think how
scared I was in that hole.

715
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:33,556
Your discovery is more
significant than you think.

716
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:36,266
I put one of the micro
crystals in the Marax.

717
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:37,472
Listen.

718
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:04,969
Yes.

719
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:08,160
Those were the
voices of the Venusians.

720
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:11,066
I would say that these
strange metallic insects

721
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:14,336
had a way of storing sound
in their crystalline nuclei.

722
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:16,391
Are you trying to tell us

723
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:20,366
that the Venusians used these insects
to record both speech and sound?

724
00:48:20,403 --> 00:48:22,210
- That's right.
- But that's fantastic.

725
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:23,760
Yes, but it's true.

726
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,853
Well, that would
mean that the hole

727
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:28,907
which Brinkmann fell into,
is a chamber of archives.

728
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:31,420
Containing some of the records

729
00:48:31,953 --> 00:48:33,066
of this planet.

730
00:48:33,888 --> 00:48:35,728
But then where can
the inhabitants be?

731
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,580
They certainly saw our spaceship
land, they couldn't have missed it,

732
00:48:38,604 --> 00:48:39,857
yet nothing happened.

733
00:48:41,037 --> 00:48:42,126
Nothing at all.

734
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,526
And my machine blowing up,

735
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:45,110
you call that nothing?

736
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:47,898
I need more figures.

737
00:48:48,476 --> 00:48:49,476
More data!

738
00:48:49,603 --> 00:48:51,961
And especially, more
of those metallic insects.

739
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:59,642
The research program
is going according to plan.

740
00:48:59,992 --> 00:49:02,555
We are all fascinated
by the vitrified forest.

741
00:49:03,031 --> 00:49:04,808
But our spacesuits are so heavy

742
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,078
that working outside
the ship is difficult.

743
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:11,222
The investigation of the power
lines leading to the white sphere,

744
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,886
and measurement of tension
changes is done by oscillograph.

745
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:17,949
The storms which whip across
Venus only make the work harder.

746
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:23,516
That's where the
lines lead to, alright.

747
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:26,995
There's no doubt.

748
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:31,027
That's it.

749
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:42,851
Tchen Yu was collecting samples
of the sand carried by the storm.

750
00:49:43,886 --> 00:49:45,566
Sometimes they are radioactive.

751
00:49:46,136 --> 00:49:47,384
Sometimes they are not.

752
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:50,628
He is searching
for traces of life.

753
00:49:54,043 --> 00:49:55,805
The long Venusian night

754
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,761
is always preceded
by a violent storm.

755
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,616
Then the outside work must stop.

756
00:50:06,766 --> 00:50:09,939
And we spend our time studying
what we have found so far.

757
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:21,340
Do you think this vitrified
forest is a biological formation?

758
00:50:22,743 --> 00:50:23,743
Why not?

759
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:26,890
It could come from
a dried-up seabed.

760
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:28,446
You're wrong.

761
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:30,597
It's not a natural formation.

762
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:36,591
Professor Sikarna has been feeding
figures and data into the electronic brain.

763
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,312
He now has some conclusions.

764
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:42,655
He says that the vitrified forest
is an enormous energy projector,

765
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,690
capable of destroying

766
00:50:44,934 --> 00:50:47,578
all life within a radius
of millions of miles.

767
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,056
Then it was built by the
inhabitants of Venus.

768
00:50:51,656 --> 00:50:52,673
Yes.

769
00:50:52,923 --> 00:50:56,622
This vitrified forest was made
to be a weapon of aggression.

770
00:50:59,272 --> 00:51:01,642
But then something
went unexpectedly wrong.

771
00:51:02,674 --> 00:51:04,472
Perhaps they decided to disarm.

772
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,052
I'm afraid it was
more serious than that.

773
00:51:10,127 --> 00:51:11,211
The metal insects

774
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:12,632
you found for us,

775
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:15,277
show us something
very significant.

776
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:18,406
That's very interesting.

777
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,467
Go on, tell us more,
Professor Sikarna.

778
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:24,171
I do not yet have all the facts.

779
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,876
But I think that a terrible
catastrophe took place on Venus.

780
00:51:28,767 --> 00:51:30,067
I reach a certain stage,

781
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:32,779
and I can't get any
further. It's chaotic.

782
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:34,712
It's like,

783
00:51:34,762 --> 00:51:36,500
it's like everything was broken.

784
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,772
Now, if there really
was a catastrophe,

785
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,701
which changed the
face of the whole planet.

786
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:45,764
Then it was so huge
a catastrophe as to be

787
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:48,202
absolutely beyond our
powers of comprehension.

788
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:52,589
We can only solve this problem,

789
00:51:55,754 --> 00:51:57,869
by means of further
systematic research.

790
00:51:57,894 --> 00:51:59,252
Take this great white sphere,

791
00:51:59,277 --> 00:52:00,929
to which all these
power line lead,

792
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,661
and whose function
we don't understand.

793
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:04,272
It appears to be

794
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:06,128
a giant transformer unit.

795
00:52:06,428 --> 00:52:07,545
Or else it is a

796
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:09,845
a force field generator!

797
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:12,902
Another strange thing

798
00:52:13,184 --> 00:52:16,175
is that there is periodic
tension in the main power line.

799
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:19,432
I would even suggest

800
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:21,889
that there might still be
Venusians inside the sphere,

801
00:52:22,128 --> 00:52:24,473
who have survived the
colossal catastrophe

802
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:25,995
that befell their planet.

803
00:52:26,134 --> 00:52:27,467
They could still be trying

804
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,434
to send an SOS
to another station.

805
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:32,346
What should we do?

806
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:35,924
We must go out and explore.

807
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,657
We'll follow the main power
line to the other at end. - Yes.

808
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,030
Calling the Cosmostrator.

809
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:58,936
We have been driving
for nearly 7 hours now.

810
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:01,040
We are following the energy line

811
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:03,352
and so far we haven't
found a trace of life.

812
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,673
This power line's got
to end somewhere.

813
00:53:22,937 --> 00:53:25,265
Doctor Harringway,
shall we keep going?

814
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:26,699
Yes.

815
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:52,845
We're still going forward.

816
00:53:53,182 --> 00:53:54,888
Keep on following
us and watch out.

817
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:57,797
What's that?

818
00:53:58,513 --> 00:54:01,051
I don't know, they're
not natural forms.

819
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:03,679
They must have been
buildings of some sort.

820
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:29,294
There must have been as
high a temperature here

821
00:54:29,594 --> 00:54:30,702
as on the sun.

822
00:54:31,788 --> 00:54:34,188
And every living
thing was destroyed

823
00:54:34,212 --> 00:54:36,171
by an incredible catastrophe.

824
00:54:46,987 --> 00:54:48,783
What are you thinking, Sumiko?

825
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,760
Of the damage.

826
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:15,836
Come.

827
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:18,259
The power line goes in here.

828
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:19,699
This must be the entrance.

829
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:21,484
Let's follow it.

830
00:55:21,515 --> 00:55:22,633
I agree with you.

831
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,130
Come on, Omega, we're going in.

832
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:56,687
Look, Venus and the Earth,
and their orbits around the sun.

833
00:55:59,867 --> 00:56:03,112
Perhaps it's a model for
instructing space pilots.

834
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:07,508
No, it probably has
a deeper significance.

835
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,192
Over here, there's a shaft.

836
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:22,099
Looks like one of the
Venusian nerve centers.

837
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:27,003
A huge control room.

838
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,496
But who was servicing it?

839
00:56:30,468 --> 00:56:31,950
Since it's apparent
that this whole

840
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:33,740
installation is
still under tension.

841
00:56:45,274 --> 00:56:46,300
Omega.

842
00:56:46,742 --> 00:56:47,742
What is it?

843
00:56:47,766 --> 00:56:49,115
Beats me.

844
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:54,632
Strange, what could it be?

845
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:56,497
It might be the
missing power source.

846
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:07,445
Look at those bubbles.

847
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:10,207
Could be a kind of organic life.

848
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,030
Omega, stop!

849
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:51,022
He's coming after us. Look!

850
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:54,356
Up the ramp, Sumiko. Quick!

851
00:58:31,098 --> 00:58:32,443
Sumiko, I'm coming!

852
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:54,714
Hold on to me, Sumiko.

853
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:32,005
- Don't panic, Sumiko!
- We'll find a way out.

854
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,056
Don't shoot,
Durand, don't shoot!

855
00:59:58,464 --> 00:59:59,464
What was that?

856
01:00:01,905 --> 01:00:03,951
Where are the others?
I can't see them.

857
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,741
I see what Durand meant now.

858
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:31,449
It's a model they used to work out
their plans of attack on the Earth.

859
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:33,974
Remember the cosmic document?

860
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:36,467
It said they would
first subject the planet

861
01:00:36,606 --> 01:00:39,160
to a highly intense
radiation bombardment.

862
01:00:39,756 --> 01:00:42,592
Thanks to this device they
calculated how atomic beams

863
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:44,345
could be directed to our planet.

864
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,207
I think you're quite right.

865
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:49,142
And directly beneath us is
their operational headquarters.

866
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:15,914
Professor Sikarna.

867
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:18,736
The glass forest is radiating
energy. Come quickly!

868
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:27,561
That's just what
I was afraid of.

869
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,525
Look at that.

870
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:32,663
The spheres turned red.

871
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,083
Gravities increasing.

872
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,248
I am not surprised.

873
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:38,776
But it's incredible.

874
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:41,163
No.

875
01:01:41,276 --> 01:01:42,732
Now everything is clear.

876
01:01:43,475 --> 01:01:45,622
The sphere creates
an artificial force field.

877
01:01:46,188 --> 01:01:48,348
Which strengthens
the gravitation of Venus.

878
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:49,671
Or diminishes it.

879
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,563
This very moment the
power is augmenting.

880
01:01:53,238 --> 01:01:54,858
When the the energy is inverted,

881
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:57,085
the field will reverse itself!

882
01:01:57,769 --> 01:01:59,549
And we'll be hurled
into space again!

883
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:02,255
Don't worry professor,
there's still time.

884
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,163
Call Harringway, quickly!

885
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:09,290
Hello, Harringway!
Come in, please!

886
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:58,227
The shadows!

887
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:00,234
Thrown on the wall

888
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:02,426
when they were hit
by an atomic explosion.

889
01:03:03,684 --> 01:03:04,859
Incredible.

890
01:03:07,478 --> 01:03:10,012
And now, the only
thing that is left of them

891
01:03:10,483 --> 01:03:11,529
is their shadows.

892
01:03:19,636 --> 01:03:23,256
The Marax is picking up commands
from the underground nerve center.

893
01:03:23,886 --> 01:03:26,353
Look at the key it's
using to decode them.

894
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:27,837
Why, it's,

895
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:29,775
it's incredible, Sikarna.

896
01:03:31,158 --> 01:03:32,910
E equal to MC squared.

897
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:35,776
That's Albert
Einstein's old formula.

898
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,837
Yes, but their
integration factor

899
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:39,818
is a curve closed upon itself.

900
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:48,850
Take a look. It's interesting.

901
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:58,534
But that's wonderful,
those are seeds.

902
01:03:59,608 --> 01:04:00,967
They're plant seeds.

903
01:04:01,668 --> 01:04:02,998
Where did you find them?

904
01:04:03,411 --> 01:04:05,642
I found them on the surface,
near the nerve center.

905
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:09,387
They were certainly carried there
by one of those big storms.

906
01:04:09,793 --> 01:04:13,280
If these seeds are still fertile, it
proves there is life on this planet.

907
01:04:14,937 --> 01:04:17,717
Professor Sikarna wants
everybody in the Marax, please.

908
01:04:25,673 --> 01:04:28,732
Our research on the metal
insects found in the cave,

909
01:04:29,114 --> 01:04:31,548
have told us a little of
this planet's history.

910
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:35,396
As to the message we
heard, there's no doubt about it.

911
01:04:36,555 --> 01:04:38,855
The inhabitants of Venus
were contemplating

912
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:41,178
launching an atomic
attack on our planet.

913
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:44,508
But the attack
wasn't carried out.

914
01:04:45,405 --> 01:04:48,125
An accident they didn't
expect, upset their plan.

915
01:04:49,145 --> 01:04:51,860
Their atomic weapons
got out their control,

916
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:54,145
a chain reaction was unleashed,

917
01:04:54,688 --> 01:04:55,948
and they all perished.

918
01:04:55,973 --> 01:04:57,799
Only their shadows remained.

919
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:00,218
And their energy projectors,

920
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,770
although partially destroyed,
are capable of working again,

921
01:05:04,169 --> 01:05:06,304
if their energy reactions
are set in motion

922
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:08,457
by some accident,
or even by one of us.

923
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:10,092
Why,

924
01:05:10,538 --> 01:05:11,758
what do you mean?

925
01:05:12,025 --> 01:05:13,785
That we've started the reaction?

926
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,380
When that rock fell
into the black mud,

927
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,664
what happened?

928
01:05:19,737 --> 01:05:22,983
But the rock was thrown out
as if the slime with a living thing.

929
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:25,015
Then something
terrible happened.

930
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:26,722
The slime began to grow rapidly.

931
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,423
First it dilated.

932
01:05:29,778 --> 01:05:30,778
Now tell us,

933
01:05:31,124 --> 01:05:32,507
what happened next?

934
01:05:32,538 --> 01:05:34,128
The black slime started to move.

935
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,811
Yes, it began to follow us.

936
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:39,023
- We were cornered.
- What did you do?

937
01:05:39,176 --> 01:05:42,236
I used the deuteron
ray gun, and I shot into it!

938
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:46,420
You should never have done that.

939
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:49,128
You started an atomic reaction!

940
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:51,230
But there was
nothing else to do.

941
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:53,477
We had no other
way of getting out.

942
01:05:54,234 --> 01:05:55,234
Yes.

943
01:05:56,463 --> 01:05:58,149
You started a chain reaction,

944
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:00,534
over the whole
atomic installation.

945
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:02,715
Now we're really in a nice mess.

946
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:04,974
What can we do?

947
01:06:04,999 --> 01:06:06,928
- What time was it?
- Seventeen hours ten.

948
01:06:06,953 --> 01:06:08,066
I remember.

949
01:06:08,348 --> 01:06:09,348
Yes!

950
01:06:10,074 --> 01:06:11,975
Yes, it was at that moment

951
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,542
that the sphere turned red.

952
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:17,361
It looks as if mass changed
into energy by a process

953
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:19,638
rather like that
of the atom bomb.

954
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:23,244
The people of this planet
knew how to reverse the process.

955
01:06:23,584 --> 01:06:25,397
They've changed
mass into energy,

956
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:28,281
but also they could change
energy back into mass.

957
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:29,900
Fantastic.

958
01:06:30,257 --> 01:06:32,036
The inhabitants of Venus are,

959
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,088
or rather were,

960
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:35,996
far in advance of us in
the applications of physics.

961
01:06:36,031 --> 01:06:38,096
That's one thing we
have to acknowledge.

962
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,210
Omega, stop!

963
01:06:52,364 --> 01:06:53,470
Omega!

964
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:03,507
Durand! Durand,
Omega's out of control!

965
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:07,867
Brinkmann, switch
off all the automats!

966
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:09,894
Talua, come and help me!

967
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,406
The glass forest!

968
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,107
The glass forest, Orloff!

969
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:21,386
The sphere is turning red!

970
01:07:23,876 --> 01:07:24,882
Orloff!

971
01:07:26,402 --> 01:07:28,049
The radiation from
the glass forest

972
01:07:28,074 --> 01:07:30,142
has upset Omega's
electronic brain.

973
01:07:30,284 --> 01:07:32,424
The Farax computer's
gone out of action as well.

974
01:07:32,755 --> 01:07:33,822
Look!

975
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:46,094
If the radiation keeps
on increasing like this,

976
01:07:46,918 --> 01:07:48,051
we won't have a chance.

977
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,890
Even the Cosmostrator's lead
shielding won't be enough to protect us.

978
01:07:52,078 --> 01:07:53,078
Durand!

979
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:57,654
I think he has internal
injuries, I must operate.

980
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:01,434
Start up the rockets, Orloff!

981
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:03,834
We must take off at once,
before it's too late!

982
01:08:04,868 --> 01:08:06,098
The motors won't work!

983
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:08,234
The gravity field is
increasing more and more.

984
01:08:08,259 --> 01:08:10,708
The radiation's paralyzed
everything, nothing is working.

985
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:14,606
The whole Cosmostrator is
nothing but an inert lump of metal.

986
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,338
There's only one chance.

987
01:08:26,573 --> 01:08:28,804
We must try to do
what the Venusians did.

988
01:08:28,886 --> 01:08:31,108
Make the energy of the
glass force in the sphere

989
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:32,825
change back into mass once more.

990
01:08:34,224 --> 01:08:35,224
Yes, but how?

991
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:37,090
When the mat attacked
you on the tower,

992
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:43,814
and you decided to use the ray gun,
which changed the mass into energy,

993
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:47,518
I think I saw something was
happening in the Venusian nerve center.

994
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:48,878
I think I know

995
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,758
how to start the
reverse process.

996
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:53,118
Can I use the rocket plane?

997
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:56,561
No, you're forgetting
the gravity field, it won't fly.

998
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,875
But the Crawlercopter will work!

999
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:03,945
You mustn't go alone.

1000
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:05,618
I'll come with you.

1001
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,006
We're entering
the Venusian city.

1002
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,224
The hurricane is
getting much worse.

1003
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,553
How is Harringway?

1004
01:09:38,606 --> 01:09:40,159
The doctor's operating now.

1005
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:44,120
Sumiko will manage.

1006
01:09:50,537 --> 01:09:51,537
Swab.

1007
01:10:08,328 --> 01:10:09,875
How are you coming
along, Durand?

1008
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:12,247
Fine, I've managed
to fix the computer.

1009
01:10:12,481 --> 01:10:14,668
Tchen Yu, can you hear me?

1010
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:15,966
Where are you?

1011
01:10:15,991 --> 01:10:18,725
We're starting to climb down
into the Venusian nerve center.

1012
01:11:08,368 --> 01:11:09,548
My space suit!

1013
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:11,074
It's punctured!

1014
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:14,261
I'm coming to help you.

1015
01:11:15,307 --> 01:11:16,854
No, Talus, go on down.

1016
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:18,616
You must save the others!

1017
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:21,012
Harringway!

1018
01:11:21,123 --> 01:11:22,356
I can't hold out for long!

1019
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:23,763
My air's escaping!

1020
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,633
The sphere is white again!

1021
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:44,759
Look, Sikarna!

1022
01:11:44,991 --> 01:11:47,152
Talua has succeeded
in reversing the field.

1023
01:11:47,238 --> 01:11:49,102
My spacesuit is punctured!

1024
01:11:49,452 --> 01:11:52,325
My oxygen's escaping and
the safety device has failed.

1025
01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:54,598
Try to hold out, Tchen Yu.

1026
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,227
You've got to!

1027
01:11:57,394 --> 01:11:58,834
The gravity is back to normal!

1028
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,829
I'll set off at once
in the rocket plane!

1029
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:03,224
I'll get you out
of it, Tchen Yu.

1030
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:05,644
Hold on, I'm coming with oxygen.

1031
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,797
Tchen Yu?

1032
01:12:10,276 --> 01:12:11,543
Hello, Tchen Yu.

1033
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,123
Hold out!

1034
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:15,067
Brinkmann is coming!

1035
01:12:21,192 --> 01:12:22,192
Tchen Yu!

1036
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:23,512
Tchen Yu!

1037
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:24,625
I must talk to him.

1038
01:12:25,005 --> 01:12:26,220
Tchen Yu, listen to me!

1039
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:27,636
Those seeds that you found.

1040
01:12:27,963 --> 01:12:30,256
They're growing! They're
growing, Tchen Yu!

1041
01:12:30,867 --> 01:12:32,967
You've proved that
there's life on the planet.

1042
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:35,534
Yes, Tchen Yu, there's
still life on Venus!

1043
01:12:40,619 --> 01:12:41,659
Sumiko.

1044
01:12:42,346 --> 01:12:43,414
There's life.

1045
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:58,093
The braking motors,
Durand, the braking motors!

1046
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,405
Talua! Tchen Yu! Brinkmann!

1047
01:13:02,531 --> 01:13:03,711
Come back at once!

1048
01:13:03,802 --> 01:13:05,362
We can't hold the
Cosmostrator down!

1049
01:13:05,387 --> 01:13:06,822
We're being
pushed off the planet!

1050
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:08,728
The reverse
process is in action.

1051
01:13:08,753 --> 01:13:10,881
The energy field is
acting like a catapult!

1052
01:13:10,912 --> 01:13:12,594
The negative
gravity is increasing!

1053
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:29,955
Brinkmann, can you hear me?

1054
01:13:30,055 --> 01:13:31,675
We're being hurled into space!

1055
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:34,759
Talua! Tchen Yu! Brinkmann!
Are you receiving me?!

1056
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:36,074
Sumiko.

1057
01:13:37,201 --> 01:13:38,281
Sumiko!

1058
01:13:39,032 --> 01:13:41,799
Orloff, we must try and go back!

1059
01:13:41,865 --> 01:13:43,839
Please! Please!

1060
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:50,437
Cosmostrator, where are you?

1061
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:53,654
Are you receiving me?
I can't get back!

1062
01:13:53,947 --> 01:13:56,087
I'm being hurled off the planet!

1063
01:14:16,622 --> 01:14:19,222
Cosmostrator, you're taking off?

1064
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:20,536
You're leaving me?

1065
01:14:21,062 --> 01:14:23,372
Harringway! Orloff!

1066
01:14:23,397 --> 01:14:24,579
Don't leave me!

1067
01:14:24,824 --> 01:14:25,979
Don't leave me!

1068
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,654
Cosmostrator!

1069
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:30,094
Cosmostrator!

1070
01:14:38,162 --> 01:14:39,709
Luna 3 calling the Earth.

1071
01:14:39,983 --> 01:14:41,789
The Cosmostrator is returning.

1072
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:43,570
The Cosmostrator is returning.

1073
01:14:43,662 --> 01:14:46,491
We have called them, but at
the moment there is no reply.

1074
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:44,374
I greet the Earth.

1075
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:46,221
I greet you all.

1076
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:56,102
We have learned much.

1077
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:58,235
But we have sacrificed

1078
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,458
a lot.

1079
01:16:59,822 --> 01:17:00,935
To much!

1080
01:17:19,312 --> 01:17:22,018
Let us honor the
memory of 3 great men.

1081
01:17:23,753 --> 01:17:26,620
Talua saved the expedition from disaster.

1082
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:28,992
Tchen Yu,

1083
01:17:29,738 --> 01:17:31,385
discovered life on Venus.

1084
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:37,138
And Brinkmann was the first
human ever to set foot on the planet.

1085
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:40,931
May they never be forgotten.

1086
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:46,911
We found traces
of a great civilization

1087
01:17:46,936 --> 01:17:49,528
that had advanced
beyond our comprehension.

1088
01:17:50,163 --> 01:17:53,344
The Venusian science had gone
beyond their power to control it.

1089
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:56,004
A dreadful catastrophe
fell upon them.

1090
01:17:57,355 --> 01:17:59,482
They were destroyed
by their own machines.

1091
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:05,003
We still have a
grave task before us.

1092
01:18:06,423 --> 01:18:08,722
(Bad audio dropouts) We must use our knowledge
to establish life again on Venus. And then, after that,
go on to explore the other planets.

1093
01:18:08,842 --> 01:18:10,789
We'll fly further and further.

1094
01:18:12,084 --> 01:18:14,284
It's Mankind's destiny.
