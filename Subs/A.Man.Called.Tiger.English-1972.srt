Look here, look here.
Look carefully.

3
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,976
Look, look.
Get a good look.

4
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,229
Here we go.

5
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:04,981
Place your bets!

6
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:14,574
There's a hidden tile!

7
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,368
Hey you!

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,203
- Mind your own business!
- Get lost!

9
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:44,770
My name's Jin Hu.

10
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,148
Staying at Arashiyama Taniguchi Hotel.

11
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:50,234
If you want more of me,
find me there.

12
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,870
CHINESE NOODLES

13
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,164
Thank you.

14
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,584
Hey, hey!

15
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,587
Wait, you haven't paid
for your noodles.

16
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,047
Dammit! We have to pay?

17
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,217
- Why did you hit me?
- Stop!

18
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,930
Why didn't you pay for your noodles?

19
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,654
I'm Jin Hu. I'm Chinese.

20
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,406
C'mon, baby.
Dinner's on me, ok?

21
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,535
- My treat, ok?
- Let's go together.

22
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:46,415
Wait, wait!

23
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,361
Come on.

24
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,840
My name's Jin Hu.
Staying at Arashiyama Taniguchi Hotel.

25
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:57,194
<i>Do you know
what it means to wander?</i>

26
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:04,160
<i>Do you know
what it means to be lost?</i>

27
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:11,333
<i>When you look around
and see no horizon found,</i>

28
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:17,757
<i>then you'll know
what it means to be lost.</i>

29
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>Do you know what desolation is?</i>

30
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>Do you know what sadness is?</i>

31
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:38,027
<i>When your tears dried up
and your heart is down,</i>

32
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:43,824
<i>then you'll know
what desolation is.</i>

33
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:50,539
<i>I used to only know happiness.</i>

34
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:57,546
<i>I used to have so much hope.</i>

35
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:03,636
<i>But since I lost you,</i>

36
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:10,935
<i>then I knew what sadness was.</i>

37
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:18,275
<i>Do you know what sorrow is?</i>

38
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:25,157
<i>Do you know what disappointment is?</i>

39
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:32,164
<i>When you've lost your love
and he's forever gone,</i>

40
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:39,255
<i>then you'll know what sorrow is.</i>

41
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:59,567
<i>When you've lost your love
and he's forever gone,</i>

42
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:07,449
<i>then you'll know what sorrow is.</i>

43
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,932
- Excuse me, have you seen this man?
- I'm sorry, no.

44
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,726
- Have you seen him?
- No.

45
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,942
- Excuse me, sir. You've seen this man?
- No.

46
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,277
And you, sir?

47
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:50,367
You're the only one who didn't clap.
Didn't like her singing?

48
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,495
How about another drink?

49
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,665
I don't have enough cash on me.

50
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,459
That's fine. It's on me.

51
00:06:58,542 --> 00:06:59,919
No, thanks.

52
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,046
I don't want to owe you.

53
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,303
I'm sorry.

54
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,472
I only have enough money
for my drink.

55
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,349
It's ok.

56
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,310
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

57
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,439
Who is he to you?

58
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:23,275
He's my father.

59
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,069
No, I haven't.

60
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:31,283
Did you like my song?

61
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,995
It was too sad.
You're too young for that.

62
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,539
Then I'll sing a happy number
for you, ok?

63
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,213
I've already told you.
I'm out of money.

64
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,923
It doesn't matter.

65
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,925
As long as you like it
then I'm happy.

66
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,950
<i>Farewell sadness, bye bye.</i>

67
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,245
<i>Farewell sorrow, bye bye.</i>

68
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,832
<i>From now on,
I'll always be smiling</i>

69
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:21,583
<i>because I have your...</i>

70
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,460
Stop singing!

71
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,838
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

72
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,172
We can talk this over.

73
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,266
What's your name?

74
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,520
My name is Yoshida Ayako.

75
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:45,024
Don't you know the rules?

76
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,067
What rules?

77
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,403
If you want to sing here,
it's 5,000 yen per day.

78
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,363
5,000 yen?

79
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,157
I don't have that kind of money.

80
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,910
Boss, go easy on her.

81
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,329
She's just a girl
looking for her father.

82
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,749
She just arrived from Hokkaido
and didn't have the time to...

83
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,213
Don't. He's Shimizu's top fighter,
Shigeo Hayashi.

84
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,926
Hmm... so you don't have money?

85
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,720
Hey, you got quite a lot here!

86
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,347
Please, I beg you.
Don't take my money!

87
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,977
Don't take my money!
Don't take my money!

88
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,021
- Get out of the way!
- I'm begging you!

89
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:30,110
A bunch of tough guys
bullying a poor little girl.

90
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,195
What gives?

91
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,489
You lecturing me?

92
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,865
I'm warning you.

93
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:45,667
I'm Jin Hu.
I'm Chinese.

94
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,128
Staying at Arashiyama Taniguchi Hotel.

95
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,548
You better get all that down.

96
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,101
I'll take you home.

97
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,021
You did the right thing.

98
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,911
Where are you staying?

99
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,580
- The same place as you.
- Really?

100
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,251
I'm also staying at
Arashiyama Taniguchi Hotel.

101
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,002
How did you know
I was staying there?

102
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,338
You forgot?
You just said it yourself.

103
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,099
My father
used to come back every year.

104
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,892
But recently,
there's been no sign of him.

105
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,811
So mother and I
came looking for him.

106
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,729
Your father must love you very much.

107
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,606
Yes. I'm his only daughter.

108
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm his most precious.

109
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,736
Mother and I came here
from Hokkaido.

110
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:56,780
But we haven't found
any trace of him.

111
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,450
And you're making a living
by singing?

112
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,079
I've been very lucky.
Everyone's been liking my singing.

113
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,747
You do sing very well.

114
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,471
Be careful!

115
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:08,518
Climb up!

116
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,094
Stop fighting!

117
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,892
- Miss Zhang.
- What is it?

118
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:33,520
That guy hit our leader, Hayashi.

119
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,439
He's my tenant.

120
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,066
Any problems,
tell Shigeo Hayashi to find me.

121
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:38,567
Yes.

122
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,863
Alright, the fight's over.
We're going back. Let's go!

123
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,208
Mr Jin.

124
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,294
Care for a lift?

125
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,162
Thank you.

126
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,890
Don't let your mother know
what happened tonight.

127
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:54,017
It'll make her old heart worry.

128
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,104
My mother's actually quite young.

129
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,064
She's only 36 years old.

130
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:05,112
Sorry. I thought mothers
were all old ladies.

131
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,290
Goodbye.

132
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,760
Madam... see you tomorrow

133
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,566
You've got some real skills there.

134
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,902
That singer just arrived
and she's already hooked.

135
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:58,498
No man's ever impressed me before.

136
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,418
Except for poor you.

137
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,045
I'm warning you.
Don't get any big ideas.

138
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,467
Since you already know everything,
you can stop bothering me.

139
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,720
Mr Jin.

140
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,599
A man should have a heart.

141
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:27,736
You're Chinese too
so I lowered the rent.

142
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:31,948
That's on you. I owe you nothing.

143
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:35,744
At least I've treated you so well.

144
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,040
Don't get too close to me.

145
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,134
If I had money, I'd buy you for a night.

146
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,889
I'm not that kind of person!

147
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,145
Even if you had the money,
money can't buy me!

148
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,814
You certainly look the part.

149
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,525
Why else would you
be so thick-skinned?

150
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,909
Fine, I won't be going then.

151
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,829
And why not?

152
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:27,212
You just said I looked the part.

153
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,589
Then I'll show you!

154
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,553
I've already told you.

155
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:35,845
I have no money.

156
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,768
You can buy now
and pay later.

157
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,479
Get the hell out!

158
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:45,981
You!

159
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,149
Madam!

160
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,277
What is it?

161
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:52,279
Someone's here to see you.

162
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,198
Tell them I'm not here!

163
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,576
It's one of Shimizu's men.

164
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:58,785
Where is he?

165
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,370
In your room.

166
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,215
I knew you'd come.

167
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,342
I didn't expect you'd be so fast.

168
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,727
How about that Chinese guy?

169
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,604
Where did you hide him?

170
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,606
I know he offended you.

171
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,274
You want to get back at him?

172
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:32,068
He didn't offend me
in the slightest.

173
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,904
But he is a troublemaker.

174
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,491
Can you give me some face?

175
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,368
Don't make it hard on him.

176
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,829
It's not up to me anymore.

177
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,248
Mr Shimizu wants to see him.

178
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,459
Mr Shimizu?

179
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:54,924
Young man, you shouldn't be so stubborn.

180
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,636
Fists can't beat guns.

181
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,888
You have some skills there.

182
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,599
Better the devil you know
than the devil you don't know.

183
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,559
I see true value in you.

184
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,394
Think about it,

185
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,897
isn't all this goofing around
just wasting your time?

186
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,567
What should I do about it, then?

187
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:16,446
Join my organisation.
We'll rule the world.

188
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,573
What? As one of your henchmen?

189
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,082
I said I value you.

190
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,377
I want you to be my right-hand man.

191
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,587
And run my entertainment line.

192
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,255
Everything you need,
you got it.

193
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:35,715
Sounds good, I'm in!

194
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:40,303
From now on,
you'll be my right-hand man.

195
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:44,140
You can command anyone
including Shigeo Hayashi.

196
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:48,853
Remember,
our biggest enemy is Yamamoto.

197
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,315
They stole a lot of
business from me.

198
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,485
I hope you can win it back.

199
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:58,154
Bring the business back here.

200
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:00,240
I'll do my best.

201
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:03,785
Also, Miss Zhang now belongs to you.

202
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,246
Thank you, Mr Shimizu.

203
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:10,458
- Can I refuse?
- No way.

204
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:15,463
How could my right-hand man
lack a pretty lady by his side?

205
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,299
You should do
as Mr Shimizu says.

206
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,930
Is this taking care of me
or monitoring me?

207
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,682
It can be both.

208
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,940
Wait.

209
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:39,487
From now on, you can't collect
their money anymore.

210
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,740
What?

211
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,247
Where's your manager?

212
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,916
Boss!

213
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,171
Sir, what would you like to drink?

214
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,257
We're not drinking.

215
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,927
Your deadline was yesterday.

216
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,720
Why haven't you pay us yet?

217
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:51,559
Sorry, I can't give you
the money anymore.

218
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,269
Why not?

219
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,735
Who's your boss?

220
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,157
I'm Yamamoto's man,
Sano Taro.

221
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,150
I'm Jin Hu.

222
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:47,115
Go and tell Yamamoto
this place belongs to Shimizu now.

223
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,367
Scram.

224
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,467
Jin Hu, you're incredible.

225
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:09,053
I don't see you for a few days,
and now you're the top dog.

226
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,017
Where you've been recently?

227
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,769
My mother was sick.

228
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,354
Did you find your father?

229
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,941
No, not yet.

230
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,235
Can I sing here today?

231
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,612
You're welcome to.

232
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:29,324
But you should ask Mr Jin.

233
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:34,829
Mr Jin Hu?

234
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:40,293
He's Mr Shimizu's right-hand man.
You must be surprised.

235
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:57,185
Mr Jin, will you let me sing here?

236
00:23:57,518 --> 00:24:02,899
Yes, not just here.
Anywhere that belongs to Shimizu.

237
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,485
Really?

238
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,988
But a fee is required
according to the rules.

239
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:14,577
100 yen a day.

240
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:18,039
Only that much?
I can afford it.

241
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,248
Chief.

242
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,002
Chief.

243
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:24,671
Come, sit!
Have a drink.

244
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:26,381
Thank you.
I don't have the time.

245
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,799
What's the matter?

246
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,926
There's something
that requires your help.

247
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,552
No need to be so polite.

248
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:35,139
There's a Chinese restaurant
that won't pay up.

249
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:37,141
You need to bother me with that?

250
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,102
This restaurant's run by Chinese.

251
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,938
Doesn't matter who it is,
the same rules apply.

252
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,942
The owner's son's an expert
in Chinese martial arts.

253
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:47,986
He's a good fighter
and not easy to handle.

254
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:49,654
Hope you can personally handle it.

255
00:24:51,864 --> 00:24:53,700
What do the rules say?

256
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,369
A warning. Then break up the place.

257
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:05,837
Let's go.

258
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:10,091
Strange.

259
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,301
How did Mr Jin become like this?

260
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,099
Society changed him.

261
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,800
Jin Hu, when did
you come back to Japan?

262
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,057
I'm here to collect
for Mr Shimizu.

263
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,266
You?

264
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:07,398
Why won't you pay UP?

265
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,151
Business is bad.
My father's ill.

266
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:14,322
Dammit!
You always have excuses!

267
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,075
What do you want?

268
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,994
What do we want?
Give us the money!

269
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,621
I don't have it now.

270
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,749
By the rules, deal with him.

271
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,326
Chief.

272
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,300
Jin Hu,
why are you doing this?

273
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,223
I don't need help from others.

274
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,437
According to the rules,
first a warning, no one dies.

275
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:15,735
If you don't pay up tomorrow,

276
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,738
I'll tear your place apart.

277
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,991
Let's go.

278
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,224
<i>Farewell sadness, bye bye.</i>

279
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,936
<i>Farewell misery, bye bye.</i>

280
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:53,189
<i>From now on
my heart will blossom</i>

281
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,775
<i>because I have your love.</i>

282
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:59,528
<i>Farewell loneliness, bye bye.</i>

283
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:02,990
<i>Farewell pain, bye bye.</i>

284
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:06,786
<i>From now on
my heart will blossom</i>

285
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,331
<i>because I have your love.</i>

286
00:29:11,123 --> 00:29:14,126
<i>The splendour of love</i>

287
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:17,630
<i>has brought me happiness.</i>

288
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,050
<i>The fire of love</i>

289
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:25,096
<i>has pushed away
the sorrow in my heart.</i>

290
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:28,057
<i>Farewell loneliness, bye bye.</i>

291
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:31,686
<i>Farewell pain, bye bye.</i>

292
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,231
<i>From now on
my heart will blossom</i>

293
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,484
<i>because I have your love.</i>

294
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,794
<i>The splendour of love</i>

295
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,214
<i>has brought me happiness.</i>

296
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,884
<i>The warmth of love</i>

297
00:30:03,884 --> 00:30:07,596
<i>has pushed away
the sorrow in my heart.</i>

298
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,474
<i>Farewell loneliness, bye bye.</i>

299
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,228
<i>Farewell pain, bye bye.</i>

300
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:18,190
<i>From now on
my heart will blossom</i>

301
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:21,360
<i>because I have your love.</i>

302
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,888
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

303
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:51,932
Thank you.

304
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:53,768
Miss Ayako.

305
00:30:58,647 --> 00:31:00,191
Mr Jin.

306
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:01,859
Please sit.

307
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:03,819
I'm fine.

308
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:06,489
Can you finish early tonight?

309
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,574
What is it?

310
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,868
I need you to do something for me.

311
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,707
Alright.

312
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,377
I have 150,000 yen here.

313
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:25,091
Deliver it to Liu Hanming
at Horikawa Chinese Restaurant.

314
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,186
I just heard you and your men today

315
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,563
attacked his place.
Is this true?

316
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:43,692
I've sold out my conscience.
I want to buy some of it back.

317
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,453
Don't tell him I sent the money.

318
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,872
And don't tell anyone.

319
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,044
Why ask me to send the money?

320
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,672
Because I trust only you.

321
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:29,238
I heard from someone
you know that Liu Hanming.

322
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,323
He's my father's student.

323
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,453
What's your father's name?

324
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,745
Jin Keqiang.

325
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:41,292
You know him?

326
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:42,960
I've met him.

327
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:47,089
When he killed himself at Pearl Club,
I was there.

328
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,258
What happened on that day?

329
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,844
I suspect someone cheated him.

330
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,262
Cheated?

331
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,599
Is there evidence?

332
00:32:56,724 --> 00:33:00,019
Evidence?
That'll be hard to find.

333
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,938
He didn't gamble with Yamamoto.

334
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,692
Yet Yamamoto now owns
your family fortune.

335
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:08,944
So I'm a bit suspicious.

336
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,742
Yamamoto Toshihiko...

337
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:19,038
I hear your old training school

338
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:21,582
will become the Yamamoto Amusement Park.

339
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,587
My father never gambled.

340
00:33:26,837 --> 00:33:29,131
When I find out who cheated him,

341
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,425
his life is mine!

342
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,187
If you won't tell me who sent this money,

343
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,564
then I won't accept it.

344
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,361
If I tell you his name,

345
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,488
then you'll accept the money?

346
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,367
It was Mr Jin Hu.

347
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,244
Him?

348
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,913
That swine.

349
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,084
Take the money back.
I want nothing to do with him!

350
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,933
Mr Jin said he felt he wronged you.

351
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:23,060
I don't need his apology.

352
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:26,021
Look what he did to my place!

353
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,566
My master was an honourable man.

354
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,568
How could his son be like this?!

355
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,987
Even though he didn't tell me,

356
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,156
I think there's a reason
why he's like this.

357
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,033
I think he's heartless!

358
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,455
If he really was heartless,

359
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:46,250
why would he ask me
to bring you this money?

360
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,967
He was very sincere.

361
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,014
I'm sure he means well.

362
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:03,183
Mr Liu, you should take this money.

363
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,727
After you fix the place up,

364
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,812
you can resume your business.

365
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,439
Things will become clear
in the end.

366
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,400
Take it.

367
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,863
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

368
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:19,825
Miss Ayako, please ask him
to meet me.

369
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:21,452
I want to ask him myself.

370
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:24,580
Alright.
I will give him the message.

371
00:35:24,663 --> 00:35:26,624
If I have any news,
I'll give you a call.

372
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:28,334
Alright.

373
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,251
I'm sorry.

374
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,671
I want to know why you're doing this.

375
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:15,297
What's really your plan.

376
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,675
And why did you mix up
with those hooligans.

377
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:22,513
It's on purpose.
I want to take a place among them.

378
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,807
And find out about everything.

379
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,308
Why?

380
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,063
To find out how my father died.

381
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,857
More importantly,
recover the overseas Chinese donations

382
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,776
my father was entrusted with.

383
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,404
They all said master was senseless.

384
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:41,281
He shouldn't have
gambled away their donations.

385
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,869
You know yourself,
he never gambles.

386
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:49,498
But master jumped to his death
from the casino building.

387
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,625
How do you explain that?

388
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,045
That's why I can't face anyone,

389
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,173
and it's also why I didn't ask
for your help.

390
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,887
Overseas Chinese compatriots
are good and honest.

391
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:07,558
What master did,
they chose to put it to rest.

392
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:11,186
Kind people donated from all around.

393
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:13,564
This devotion is truly admirable.

394
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:17,526
It hurts me more to hear that. Truly.

395
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:21,321
They donated their hard-earned money.

396
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,073
And entrusted it to my father.

397
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,534
Now he's dead for no clear reason.

398
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,412
And the money's gone without a trace.

399
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,459
I don't believe he'd be this senseless.

400
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,086
Something must've happened.

401
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:40,632
When I tended master's body,
one of his ribs was broken.

402
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,721
It's obvious he fought someone
before his death.

403
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,265
Someone who's definitely
a strong fighter.

404
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:52,603
I knew something was up.

405
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:55,230
I must avenge my father.

406
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,149
And get rid of them,
once and for all.

407
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,909
You'll be on your own.
Won't it be too dangerous?

408
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:10,412
I'll do my best.
The rest is up to fate.

409
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:11,914
Do you have any leads?

410
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:17,211
I only know that a Yamamoto Toshihiko
cheated my father.

411
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,588
I want to confront him.

412
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,591
Yamamoto?

413
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:25,886
I have a friend,
he's one of his henchmen.

414
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,555
He asked me to join them.
I refused every time.

415
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,849
I can join them
and help you investigate.

416
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,769
My hands are already dirty.

417
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:35,521
I won't drag you into this.

418
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,357
As long as our intentions are just,

419
00:38:38,398 --> 00:38:40,734
who cares what happens,
why must we fight?

420
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,328
The hell's this?

421
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,647
You called me?

422
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,405
I heard you found a fat sheep.

423
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,741
He came to me himself.

424
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,827
I won't ask how.

425
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:17,247
I just want you to be honest.

426
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,250
What do you mean?

427
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,212
Are we going to split the share,
like we did before?

428
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,382
This deal has nothing
to do with you.

429
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,890
You mean I'll get nothing?

430
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,892
There's no reason
to give you anything.

431
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:42,105
Did you know that Jin Keqiang's son,
Jin Hu, works for me now?

432
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,900
Don't use him to threaten me.

433
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:49,738
I may have planned his father's death,
but you were the one who carried it out.

434
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:51,281
You think he'll believe you?

435
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,493
I'll stop at nothing to
protect my interests.

436
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,828
You don't want peace then?

437
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,456
I didn't start the problem with you.

438
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,459
Think you'll win me at a game of dice?

439
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,253
May the best man win.
We'll meet at the gambling table.

440
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,255
Fine. Let's see what you got.

441
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,885
Mr Shimizu, I'll show you.
Any time, any place.

442
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,948
Open.

443
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,868
How's your luck been?

444
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:22,372
Not great.
How about we try yours?

445
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,167
With your money?

446
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,461
If you win, it's mine.

447
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,379
Sure.

448
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:34,593
I'll bet the lot.

449
00:42:34,968 --> 00:42:35,969
Go ahead.

450
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:47,773
Seven! Lucky seven!
Lucky seven!

451
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,484
Seven”.

452
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,280
I'm really sorry, we lost.

453
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:58,366
Let's try another one.
This time I'll buy the chips.

454
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:01,953
I didn't come here to win.

455
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,372
There's a show
in the club downstairs.

456
00:43:05,957 --> 00:43:08,960
Let's find a quiet place to chat.

457
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:11,004
Chat? With Who?

458
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:13,507
With you, of course.

459
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,303
Let's go upstairs, then.

460
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:41,451
There's drinks and music here.
We can chat and dance too.

461
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,955
This place's not bad.

462
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,457
Even if you lost everything downstairs,

463
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:50,836
you wouldn't jump to your death
after coming here.

464
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:53,755
You're quite funny.

465
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:57,008
My name's Reiko.
What's yours?

466
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,135
Jin Hu.

467
00:44:00,011 --> 00:44:01,888
What an honour.

468
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:04,266
You're very well known
in Kyoto recently.

469
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:08,228
What brought you to the casino?

470
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:11,398
My father jumped to his death here.

471
00:44:11,606 --> 00:44:12,732
Jin Keqiang?

472
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,361
What's your intention?

473
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,574
To find out what really happened.

474
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:22,492
Oh, I see.

475
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,912
He lost miserably.
80 million, in fact.

476
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:28,039
I'd like to see the boss here.

477
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:31,376
He won't see you.

478
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,752
How do you know?

479
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:35,088
Do you know who you're drinking with?

480
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,090
Miss Reiko?

481
00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:42,012
You're half right.
I'm also Yamamoto's woman.

482
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,140
I thought so. You work for Yamamoto.

483
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,851
I didn't expect you're Madam Yamamoto.

484
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,352
Pardon me.

485
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:53,315
You're mistaken. I'm not married to him.

486
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:55,066
I just belong to him.

487
00:44:57,777 --> 00:45:00,405
I think you better leave here now.

488
00:45:01,656 --> 00:45:03,450
And if I don't?

489
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,870
I wouldn't want anything
bad happening to you.

490
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,040
Is that a warning from Yamamoto?

491
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:12,125
Leave or not, it's up to you.

492
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,337
I never take threats.

493
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,796
Then you just wait here!

494
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,342
HOW long?

495
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,554
Hard to say. Maybe a minute.

496
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,265
That fast, eh?

497
00:45:27,682 --> 00:45:29,517
Look over there.

498
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,109
You want your men to take me out?

499
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:42,030
It's the best way
to deal with someone like you.

500
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:47,827
Hold it!

501
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,455
The hell you doing?
Using force on a girl?

502
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:51,539
This is absurd!

503
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,335
Take me to Yamamoto.
I'll apologise later.

504
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:01,049
Thank you.

505
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,305
Who are you?

506
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:09,599
Jin Hu.

507
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:12,352
Jin Keqiang was my father.

508
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,523
To what do I owe the pleasure?

509
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:19,359
I want some answers from you.

510
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,154
Reiko, you may go now.

511
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:28,076
Please sit down.

512
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:44,301
Who sold you
my father's martial arts school?

513
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,221
Did Shimizu tell you that?

514
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,056
That doesn't concern you.

515
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:54,144
Then who I bought it from
doesn't concern you either.

516
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,275
Is that your answer?

517
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,111
My answer's simple.

518
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:06,114
Get the hell out!

519
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:12,620
No need to get so angry now.

520
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,877
You dare to make a scene?!

521
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:22,672
I'm not satisfied with your answer.

522
00:47:23,798 --> 00:47:24,799
Teach him a lesson!

523
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:48,114
Talk! Who sold you
my father's school?

524
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:49,824
Why should I tell you?

525
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:51,951
Are you going to talk or not?

526
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:56,956
Talk, now!

527
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,294
It was through a broker.

528
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,088
Show me the deed!

529
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:05,507
Let me go first!

530
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,677
I'm warning you!

531
00:48:10,011 --> 00:48:12,097
These guys are no match for me.

532
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,141
You wouldn't dare to shoot me here.

533
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:19,020
Do what I say. Show me the deed.

534
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,563
Show it now!

535
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,574
See for yourself. It's all legal.

536
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:36,121
DEED
SELLER: JIN / BUYER: YAMAMOTO

537
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,540
ADDRESS: 4TH BLOCK, KAWARAMACHI, NI-CHOME

538
00:48:38,623 --> 00:48:41,459
BROKER: NAGATANI SHOKI

539
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,090
Sorry for the trouble.

540
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:48,902
After him! Quick!

541
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,198
Get up there, quick!

542
00:50:16,137 --> 00:50:17,639
In the car! Get him!

543
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:25,897
Who are you?

544
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:29,692
Didn't expect me, huh?

545
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,486
It is unexpected.

546
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:34,572
Someone's following us.

547
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,743
Go faster!

548
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,328
With me driving,
they'll never catch up.

549
00:51:01,015 --> 00:51:03,851
Take the key.
The car's over there.

550
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,665
Dammit! He escaped!

551
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,166
Let's go.

552
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,174
- Why are you helping me?
- I like men like you.

553
00:51:35,174 --> 00:51:37,302
You're hard to make out.

554
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,512
Why? You think this is a trap?

555
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,055
I wouldn't fall for it anyway.

556
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:44,100
Even my sexiness and beauty
couldn't tempt you?

557
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,979
- Won't be easy.
- C'mon. Wanna make a bet?

558
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:51,649
- I won't admit defeat.
- Fine, come to the hotel with me then.

559
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:53,401
I'm not interested.

560
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,363
Why don't you admit
you don't have the balls.

561
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:01,242
Fine, I accept your challenge.

562
00:52:02,493 --> 00:52:04,370
You're so brave!

563
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,914
But I have to go somewhere first.

564
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,082
You're gonna run away?

565
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:11,169
Don't worry. I'm not afraid,
even if it's the lion's den.

566
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,796
Good. So where you heading to?

567
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,425
4th Block, Kawaramachi, Ni-chome.

568
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,678
4TH BLOCK, KAWARAMACHI, NI-CHOME

569
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,313
Don't forget.
Tonight at Grand Hotel. I'll be waiting.

570
00:52:54,295 --> 00:52:56,798
Excuse me, do you know
Nagatani Shoki?

571
00:52:56,881 --> 00:52:58,800
That's my father.

572
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,511
I'd like to see him.

573
00:53:01,594 --> 00:53:03,179
He went to Thailand.

574
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:07,308
Does he like to gamble?

575
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,435
He never gambles.

576
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,565
Does he work
in the realty business?

577
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,860
He doesn't have any business
except for this bar.

578
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,864
Thank you.

579
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:25,993
- Chief, I looked all over for you.
- What is it?

580
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:28,246
Mr Shimizu wants to see you.

581
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,467
Jin Hu, this is Mr Yama Hiro.

582
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:47,932
He tells me, Yamamoto's dealer
Ohmura is no good.

583
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,727
I think it's rather suspicious.

584
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:54,021
So you doubt my judgement then?

585
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,899
No, what I mean is,

586
00:53:56,899 --> 00:53:59,360
Yamamoto's clever enough
to cook up something.

587
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,405
He'll definitely have
someone good tomorrow night.

588
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,949
No one's ever beaten me
except for my master.

589
00:54:05,616 --> 00:54:07,243
Who's your master?

590
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,078
Nagatani Ichiro.

591
00:54:10,204 --> 00:54:11,581
Can you find him?

592
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,542
I heard he went to Thailand.

593
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,253
Thafland?

594
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:20,923
Jin Hu, tomorrow's game
is very important.

595
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:22,800
You must protect Mr Yamashiro.

596
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:25,762
Yes, sir.

597
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,515
After your mission's complete,
I'll pay you the 10% bonus as agreed.

598
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,558
Thank you.

599
00:54:30,641 --> 00:54:33,394
Mr Shimizu, do you need me
to go with him?

600
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,396
No need.

601
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:39,066
You two should have
an early night.

602
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,693
Yes, sir.

603
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,662
Dammit.

604
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,331
Hayashi.

605
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:01,005
- Sir.
- Unhappy, are we?

606
00:55:01,672 --> 00:55:03,382
I'd dare not, sir.

607
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:07,887
Master, these jobs used to be mine.

608
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,681
It's not your concern.
I know what to do

609
00:55:11,265 --> 00:55:12,517
Yes, sir.

610
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,584
Sorry to keep you waiting.

611
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:39,896
Don't forget.
This is about gambling.

612
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,647
Without patience, how can you win?

613
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,735
Please stop tormenting me.

614
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,904
I admit I've lost.

615
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,530
I love you.

616
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,742
I don't want to use love to cheat you.

617
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:53,993
Cheat me?

618
00:56:54,785 --> 00:56:56,329
Because I need your help.

619
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,248
You want to avenge your father?

620
00:57:03,502 --> 00:57:07,089
I need you to tell me
how my father died.

621
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:14,055
I only know a little.

622
00:57:16,849 --> 00:57:23,064
Yamamoto wanted the land
your father used for his school.

623
00:57:23,147 --> 00:57:26,233
So he sent for Nine-fingered Ichiro.

624
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,527
Nine-fingered Ichiro? Who's he?

625
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,657
He's a dice dealer and a cheat.

626
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,493
My father wouldn't befriend a cheat.

627
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,997
I only know that he fell
from the roof.

628
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:42,083
I don't really know
much more than that.

629
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,319
Don't go to Pearl Club anymore.

630
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,738
Yamamoto sent
a professional killer after you.

631
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,992
Oh? Who is he?

632
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:18,285
Yoshida Ryohei.
He's a famous knife-thrower.

633
00:58:18,452 --> 00:58:20,329
What can you tell me about him?

634
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:23,499
He's maybe around 40 years old.

635
00:58:23,582 --> 00:58:25,876
He's missing
a portion of his left ear.

636
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,337
I heard he lost it in a fight.

637
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,174
He must be pretty tough then.

638
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:34,927
Promise me, please.
You won't go there again.

639
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,346
The money that your father lost...
I'll think of something.

640
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:39,348
Why are you so kind to me?

641
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:42,727
I love you.

642
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:46,397
It's dangerous
to love a man like me.

643
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:48,899
I'm not afraid.

644
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:01,078
Chief.

645
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:06,751
What are you doing in my car?

646
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,419
Something bad happened.

647
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,629
Only you can take care of it.

648
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,757
- Where?
- I'll take you.

649
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,073
Where?

650
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,699
Over there.

651
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,108
You can stop stalling around.

652
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,903
Guess you tricked me.
So what do you want?

653
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,405
You're a smart man.

654
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,825
I want to settle the matter today.

655
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:23,244
How do you want to do it?

656
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,412
I want to settle the score
with you!

657
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:27,081
Come out!

658
01:00:33,712 --> 01:00:36,715
So what? You've came prepared.

659
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:38,050
Just this bunch though?

660
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:42,179
Jin, Shimizu's business
used to be mine.

661
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,140
Don't think you can
just show up, Chinaman,

662
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,433
and take what belongs to the Japanese.

663
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:51,230
Sorry to tell you,
today you die!

664
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:53,482
Don't be so happy about it.

665
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:55,943
We don't know
whose clay to die it is just yet.

666
01:00:56,193 --> 01:00:57,903
Bring it on!

667
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,238
Get him!

668
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,741
Hello?

669
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,161
You lazy bum. Still sleeping?

670
01:05:57,202 --> 01:05:58,745
Where are you?

671
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,039
Am I not in your heart?

672
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,418
I want to do something for you.

673
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,003
Really?

674
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:09,339
The funds for tonight's big game,

675
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:12,426
Yamamoto entrusted them to me.

676
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,928
I can steal them.
Consider this revenge for your father.

677
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,014
What do you think?

678
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:20,184
It's too dangerous.

679
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,978
I'd risk it for you.

680
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:26,398
Be at Arashiyama Station
tonight at 9:45.

681
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,402
There's a ship to Yokohama at 10.
We'll take it and leave Japan.

682
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,739
- Goodbye.
- Hello? Hello?

683
01:07:21,703 --> 01:07:24,289
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

684
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,209
I need your help again.

685
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,586
You're too kind.

686
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,005
If I can do it, no problem.

687
01:07:33,173 --> 01:07:37,177
Can you come with me to the station
tonight to pick up a girl?

688
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:39,721
What do you need me for?

689
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:43,517
I need to hide her in your room.

690
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,979
If madam finds out, then what?

691
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:49,648
Madam won't be at the hotel tonight.

692
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,858
But you need to keep it a secret.

693
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,989
Aright, I promise.

694
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:03,745
Why didn't you say
you were back tonight?

695
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:08,458
Something came up.
I didn't have enough time.

696
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,545
Can't even call me?

697
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,017
Fine, I'll make it up to you.

698
01:08:37,362 --> 01:08:39,197
Go on, what is it?

699
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:44,536
Don't ask now.
Be at Cat's Eye Bar tonight at 10.

700
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:46,955
We'll go to Pearl Club together.

701
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,027
Get in.

702
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,428
Thanks but I don't smoke.

703
01:09:43,428 --> 01:09:44,513
I know.

704
01:09:44,846 --> 01:09:47,849
If you see me being followed,
light this cigarette.

705
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:49,726
Then throw it out the window.

706
01:09:52,604 --> 01:09:53,730
Sit in the back seat.

707
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,483
If anything happens
after I get off the car,

708
01:09:56,608 --> 01:09:57,984
close the door.

709
01:09:57,984 --> 01:09:59,361
I'll handle it.

710
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:06,743
You scared?

711
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:09,371
Yeah, a little bit.

712
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:13,834
Don't be. I'm just being cautious.
There won't be any danger.

713
01:10:15,752 --> 01:10:17,671
Why are you trembling?

714
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,966
I'm... I'm not.

715
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:25,011
You're still a kid.

716
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,521
ARASHIYAMA STATION

717
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:27,532
Don't be afraid.
There's no one else around.

718
01:11:27,532 --> 01:11:29,201
- Did you buy the tickets?
- Yes.

719
01:11:29,242 --> 01:11:30,327
How are things at the club?

720
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:33,705
Everyone's busy gambling.
No one noticed me.

721
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,500
- How much altogether?
- 700 million.

722
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:38,960
I was so scared to death.

723
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:41,213
You were just too nervous.

724
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,384
Smoke one to calm your nerves.

725
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,608
I'll carry that for you.

726
01:12:03,151 --> 01:12:07,155
I feel so dizzy...
So dizzy...

727
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:56,872
Mrs Yoshida.

728
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:59,207
Please hold onto this.

729
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:00,584
Thank you.

730
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,506
I'm sick. My apologies
I can't be more hospitable.

731
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,216
Not at all.

732
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,387
She'll sleep for about three hours.

733
01:13:12,512 --> 01:13:15,724
If she wakes up sooner,
don't let her go out.

734
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:17,684
Wait for me to come back.

735
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,978
Alright.

736
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,331
Mr Jin!

737
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:44,461
Mr Jin.

738
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,633
What is it?

739
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:52,928
- Are you going to Pearl Club?
- Yes.

740
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:55,805
Can you not go?

741
01:13:58,558 --> 01:14:03,355
Since I can't stop you,
please be careful.

742
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:10,111
I know.

743
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:20,121
Wear this on your neck.
It'll protect you.

744
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,046
Thank you.

745
01:14:57,575 --> 01:14:58,994
Sorry to keep you waiting.

746
01:14:59,202 --> 01:15:00,870
A single lady waiting alone in a bar -

747
01:15:00,912 --> 01:15:02,664
what kind of an impression
does that give?

748
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,499
I'm sorry. Let's go.

749
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,212
Wait here for a moment.

750
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,508
- Miss Emi.
- Yes?

751
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:16,511
Does your father
also go by the name Ichiro?

752
01:15:16,636 --> 01:15:18,722
Ichiro? That's his nickname.

753
01:15:18,763 --> 01:15:21,516
Does anyone call him Nine-fingered Ichiro?

754
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:25,937
No but two years ago,
the little finger of his left hand

755
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,355
was cut off by a car door.

756
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,443
Why are you asking me this?

757
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:34,696
There's an expert gambler called
Nine-fingered Ichiro.

758
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:37,115
He might come
to Pearl Club tonight.

759
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:38,992
It couldn't possibly be my father.

760
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:40,326
He's gone to Thailand.

761
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:42,412
He's an honest old man.

762
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,913
And he never gambles.

763
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,416
I hope it's not the same man.

764
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:47,917
Let's go.

765
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,546
Why do you keep saying
he's a gambler?

766
01:15:51,629 --> 01:15:53,923
I'm not sure.
I'm just asking.

767
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:59,095
What's going on?

768
01:16:00,096 --> 01:16:03,183
Xiao Li,
go with me to the club.

769
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,685
You're going to the club?

770
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:08,313
I want to see
if he's really my father.

771
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,340
Excuse me,
can you come here?

772
01:16:41,554 --> 01:16:43,473
- What happened, miss?
- I sprained my ankle.

773
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:44,933
Do you need help walking?

774
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:47,727
It's alright.
Can you just help me park the car?

775
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:49,813
Sure. Sure.

776
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:51,022
Thank you.

777
01:16:51,147 --> 01:16:52,398
PEARL CLUB

778
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:32,438
Are you Jin Hu?

779
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:36,151
You must be the assassin,
Yoshida Ryohei.

780
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:40,196
That's right.
The wait has been my honour.

781
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,739
To what do I owe the pleasure?

782
01:17:41,906 --> 01:17:44,325
Please follow me to the roof.

783
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:46,119
I have something to tell you.

784
01:17:46,911 --> 01:17:49,164
Can't you just kill me here?

785
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,250
You're not welcome at this casino.

786
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:55,211
So I'll find a comfortable place for you.

787
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:57,505
Save yourself the trouble.

788
01:17:57,797 --> 01:18:00,008
Welcome or not,
I'm still going in.

789
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:03,469
If you try,
I'll have to kill you.

790
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:07,390
You wouldn't dare to shoot me here.

791
01:18:19,235 --> 01:18:20,486
Don't shout!

792
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,559
Stop! Put the gun away.

793
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,400
Why are you still here?!

794
01:19:05,448 --> 01:19:06,574
Mr Yamamoto,

795
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:10,370
does your club usually
use violence on its guests?

796
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:12,914
No.

797
01:19:13,164 --> 01:19:15,041
This has nothing to do
with the club.

798
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,834
A misunderstanding on my part.

799
01:19:20,004 --> 01:19:22,215
Everyone, please sit.
Everything's fine now.

800
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,300
Carry on please.
Please sit.

801
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:26,219
Carry on.

802
01:19:30,139 --> 01:19:32,517
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

803
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:48,950
Please sit.

804
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:53,871
- How is it?
- Nothing much here.

805
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:09,637
10 million.

806
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,973
- 10 million?
- 10 million?

807
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:13,599
That's a lot.

808
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,023
It's your bet. You decide.

809
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:44,964
Wow! A straight!

810
01:21:04,567 --> 01:21:07,487
Wow! A high score!

811
01:21:22,668 --> 01:21:24,837
He's faking it.

812
01:21:24,879 --> 01:21:28,132
You mean he's pretending
to be nervous?

813
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:30,093
He lost the first roll.

814
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,595
This time he'll have six of a kind.

815
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:36,557
Open!

816
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:41,229
- All red!
- All red!

817
01:22:05,169 --> 01:22:07,880
20 million. Stacking dice.

818
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:21,102
Mr Nagatani, can I raise the pot?

819
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:25,523
Welcome.

820
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:29,986
Another 20 million.

821
01:22:39,078 --> 01:22:40,580
Call.

822
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:18,910
1, 2, 3, 4...

823
01:23:18,993 --> 01:23:21,329
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!

824
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:58,157
<i>What? It's not a 6!</i>

825
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:02,620
<i>What happened?</i>

826
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:14,173
Wait!

827
01:24:14,882 --> 01:24:15,925
What is it?

828
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:18,970
Mr Yamashiro,
with big stakes,

829
01:24:19,053 --> 01:24:21,681
please reveal the dice slowly.

830
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:24,350
May I open it now?

831
01:24:24,433 --> 01:24:26,143
You may.

832
01:24:37,863 --> 01:24:40,741
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's take a break.

833
01:24:40,866 --> 01:24:42,868
We'll resume in one hour.

834
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:44,579
Please have some rest outside.

835
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:47,331
- Let's go. Alright.
- Take a rest.

836
01:24:57,633 --> 01:24:58,926
Mr Shimizu, I'm so sorry.

837
01:24:59,176 --> 01:25:00,928
I don't know what happened.

838
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:04,765
Mr Ma.

839
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:07,602
Boss, I'm sorry.
I failed you.

840
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:10,187
Don't worry about it.
Just stay calm.

841
01:25:10,313 --> 01:25:12,315
Everyone, stay alert.

842
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:14,775
It's gonna be a rough night.

843
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:25,536
Strange.

844
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,414
I've never failed
at stacking dice before.

845
01:25:28,497 --> 01:25:29,957
What happened?

846
01:25:30,082 --> 01:25:33,919
We were tricked.
When he yelled out, "Wait",

847
01:25:33,919 --> 01:25:35,212
there was something wrong there.

848
01:25:35,254 --> 01:25:36,922
Boss, I'm sorry.

849
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:39,133
It's fine, don't worry.

850
01:25:39,508 --> 01:25:41,636
Plenty of other chances.
Just stay calm.

851
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,485
It should be here.

852
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:05,868
What do you want?

853
01:26:07,995 --> 01:26:10,081
We're here to gamble.

854
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:11,957
You're here to gamble?

855
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:15,461
What? Isn't this a club?

856
01:26:15,836 --> 01:26:17,129
What if it is?

857
01:26:17,254 --> 01:26:18,798
You have money?

858
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,717
Of course I do!
Would I'd be here if I didn't?

859
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,969
Show me your chips!

860
01:26:25,262 --> 01:26:26,681
Chips?

861
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:28,891
Chips...

862
01:26:29,558 --> 01:26:31,394
The chips are...

863
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,562
- The chips...
- Get out of here!

864
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:37,483
He's my friend. Let him in.

865
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:46,867
If not for you, I'd beat him up.

866
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:48,744
Why are you here?

867
01:26:48,744 --> 01:26:50,246
I'm looking for Jin Hu.

868
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,749
He's inside.
Act like you don't know me.

869
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,868
What are you doing here?

870
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:32,329
You said there was a gambler
that looks like my father.

871
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:33,873
I asked him to take a look with me.

872
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:42,381
The heavy man in the corner,
brown suit, smoking a cigar.

873
01:27:42,506 --> 01:27:43,924
See if he's the one.

874
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:02,902
No.

875
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:04,945
It's not him?

876
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:09,283
Then he's someone else's father,
I've found him by accident.

877
01:28:09,366 --> 01:28:11,243
Whose father is he?

878
01:28:11,243 --> 01:28:12,912
Ayako's.

879
01:28:12,953 --> 01:28:15,539
He's the assassin
Yamamoto sent after me.

880
01:28:16,081 --> 01:28:17,374
Where?

881
01:28:22,671 --> 01:28:24,799
His name is Yoshida Ryohei.

882
01:28:25,299 --> 01:28:27,384
He's been waiting for me.

883
01:28:27,384 --> 01:28:30,137
The second I'm alone,
he'll make his move.

884
01:28:30,429 --> 01:28:31,806
Then I'll bring Ayako.

885
01:28:31,847 --> 01:28:33,557
That way you'll have one less enemy.

886
01:28:33,682 --> 01:28:34,934
Alright.

887
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:39,164
Mr Ohmura isn't feeling well.
I'd like to switch with a new dealer.

888
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:40,332
That's fine.

889
01:29:40,457 --> 01:29:44,128
I came here to gamble
and meet more professionals.

890
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:46,505
Excellent. Sit.

891
01:30:03,814 --> 01:30:06,567
- May I know your name?
- Nagatani.

892
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:11,113
Oh? Nagatani?
I'm Nagatani Ichiro.

893
01:30:11,196 --> 01:30:12,615
Is that your name, too?

894
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:19,496
What a coincidence.
Two people with the same name.

895
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,209
It is, it is.

896
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:26,003
Place your bet, please.

897
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:31,258
50 million. Stacking dice.

898
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,053
Wait.

899
01:30:34,136 --> 01:30:35,930
What's the matter?

900
01:30:37,056 --> 01:30:39,350
Remove your gloves, please.

901
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:41,393
Oh... my apologies.

902
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,329
Call?

903
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:04,458
WW aren't you calling?!

904
01:31:17,513 --> 01:31:18,097
Wait!

905
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:21,558
Don't worry.

906
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:26,981
My dice will still stack up
even if there's an earthquake.

907
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,545
It's all red!

908
01:31:56,218 --> 01:31:57,094
Please.

909
01:32:01,473 --> 01:32:02,641
I lost this one.

910
01:32:10,774 --> 01:32:11,942
100 million.

911
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:30,044
What's the matter with you?!

912
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:32,588
I'm truly sorry.
We have to stop here.

913
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:33,672
Why?

914
01:32:33,922 --> 01:32:36,091
That dealer is my master.

915
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:39,011
Is he Nine-fingered Ichiro?

916
01:32:39,803 --> 01:32:42,473
I'm not so sure.

917
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:17,174
Miss, you're awake?

918
01:33:17,257 --> 01:33:18,675
Where am I?

919
01:33:18,801 --> 01:33:21,553
How did I get here?

920
01:33:21,637 --> 01:33:23,180
This is my home.

921
01:33:23,263 --> 01:33:25,349
Mr Jin brought you here.

922
01:33:25,432 --> 01:33:26,975
Where did he go?

923
01:33:27,017 --> 01:33:29,103
Pearl Club.

924
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:31,188
Oh no! I must go and see him.

925
01:33:32,064 --> 01:33:33,982
He told me not to let you leave!

926
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:36,151
You don't know the danger he's in.

927
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:37,486
I must go!

928
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:41,865
I know but he clearly said
you must wait for him to get back.

929
01:33:42,032 --> 01:33:43,367
Miss Ayako!

930
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:45,786
That must be Mr Jin.

931
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:52,751
Miss Nagatani, Mr Li,
come in, have a seat.

932
01:33:58,006 --> 01:33:59,550
This is my mother.

933
01:34:01,093 --> 01:34:04,012
Miss Ayako, I got good news.
I saw your father.

934
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,392
- Really?
- Yes!

935
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:10,561
He's alive?

936
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:12,312
Where is he?

937
01:34:13,522 --> 01:34:15,149
Pearl Club.

938
01:34:16,191 --> 01:34:18,735
Is Yashida Ryohei your husband?

939
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,697
Yashida Ryohei?

940
01:34:22,364 --> 01:34:24,241
That's Yamamoto's assassin.

941
01:34:24,366 --> 01:34:27,619
Nonsense.
He's no hired assassin.

942
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:29,037
I don't believe you.

943
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:30,998
He's out to kill my friend Jin Hu.

944
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:32,332
That's why I'm here to see you.

945
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:36,670
You're lying!
My father isn't a bad person!

946
01:34:37,838 --> 01:34:40,674
Mother, tell me, father isn't a killer.

947
01:34:40,799 --> 01:34:42,509
He's not a bad person, right?

948
01:34:43,051 --> 01:34:45,387
I didn't want to tell you.

949
01:34:45,721 --> 01:34:48,390
Your father's not a good man.

950
01:34:48,515 --> 01:34:50,893
He's killed so many people.

951
01:35:01,111 --> 01:35:04,323
Miss Ayako, Mr Jin is in great danger.

952
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:05,908
And he's a good person.

953
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,910
We have to find a way to help him.

954
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:09,995
What can I do?

955
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:12,080
There's nothing I can do.

956
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:14,291
Please speak to your father.

957
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:16,501
At least Mr Jin can stand a chance.

958
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:20,631
Miss Ayako, I beg of you.
Please help us.

959
01:35:20,839 --> 01:35:24,051
Tell your father, Mr Jin saved us.

960
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:27,304
He can kill anyone but not Mr Jin.

961
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,181
We have to go, now!

962
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:33,810
50 million.

963
01:35:52,871 --> 01:35:56,250
Mr Nagatani,
you're on a winning streak.

964
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:59,836
Seems like you'll never lose.

965
01:36:01,129 --> 01:36:04,591
Guess it's my lucky day.

966
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:07,761
It's not luck.

967
01:36:07,844 --> 01:36:10,722
Your skills... reminds me of...

968
01:36:11,765 --> 01:36:13,433
Nine-fingered Ichiro.

969
01:36:14,142 --> 01:36:16,061
Nine-fingered Ichiro?

970
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,165
Nine-fingered Ichiro.

971
01:36:37,165 --> 01:36:38,792
Is your real name Nagatani Shoki?

972
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:40,877
And so what if it is?

973
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:43,797
I win by skill and not by cheating.

974
01:36:45,424 --> 01:36:47,509
If you're really Nagatani Shoki...

975
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,636
Now just hold on.

976
01:36:55,642 --> 01:37:00,230
Mr Yamamoto,
I've already lost over 200 million.

977
01:37:00,522 --> 01:37:03,608
Please remove these two
who only came here to watch.

978
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:06,528
Alright. You two, leave.

979
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:08,196
Yes, sir.

980
01:37:09,614 --> 01:37:10,907
Let's go.

981
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:20,625
Don't move!

982
01:37:22,919 --> 01:37:26,131
Let me ask you all,
are guns allowed in here?

983
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,592
Absolutely not.

984
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:30,427
Why are you still here?!

985
01:37:36,933 --> 01:37:40,062
If you cause more trouble,
I'll take you to the police station!

986
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:48,945
Did you open this place
just to have a sure win?

987
01:37:50,405 --> 01:37:51,948
Nobody can guarantee that.

988
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,789
But you can.

989
01:37:58,872 --> 01:38:00,832
You have proof?

990
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:05,379
First, you don't have
any available funds.

991
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:09,132
Second, the cash guests
used for the chips...

992
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,009
has been stolen!

993
01:38:12,302 --> 01:38:13,553
What proof do you have?!

994
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:16,139
There's not a penny in the safe.

995
01:38:16,264 --> 01:38:20,685
- How dare you accuse me!
- He took all of our money!

996
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:23,397
I'm warning you!
If any money is missing, I'll kill you!

997
01:38:23,438 --> 01:38:24,523
Give us the money back!

998
01:38:24,606 --> 01:38:26,566
You know not to mess
with Mr Shimizu!

999
01:38:26,608 --> 01:38:28,318
Cheat us and we'll destroy this club!

1000
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:30,821
- That's breaking the law!
- We'll close your club!

1001
01:38:30,862 --> 01:38:33,698
- Give back the money!
- Everyone, calm down!

1002
01:38:33,824 --> 01:38:35,283
Facts speak louder than words!

1003
01:38:36,701 --> 01:38:37,994
Where are you going?

1004
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:40,705
- I'll show you where the cash is!
- I don't believe you.

1005
01:38:40,705 --> 01:38:42,582
- You don't? Come and look for yourself!
- Fine!

1006
01:38:42,624 --> 01:38:44,209
- Everyone, let's follow him!
- Yes.

1007
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:00,016
Though you've been forced
to be a tool by others,

1008
01:39:00,058 --> 01:39:03,728
what you've done
was for hurting.

1009
01:39:05,021 --> 01:39:09,192
Not only have you cheated yourself,
but also your daughter.

1010
01:39:09,192 --> 01:39:13,029
She always thought
you were a good father.

1011
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:16,491
You know my daughter?

1012
01:39:19,744 --> 01:39:23,498
Emi is a nice and humble girl.

1013
01:39:23,623 --> 01:39:26,877
If she knew that her father
was a cheat...

1014
01:39:26,918 --> 01:39:28,211
imagine how hurt she'd be.

1015
01:39:29,045 --> 01:39:30,297
I'm no cheat!

1016
01:39:31,756 --> 01:39:34,926
Even now, you still deny it?

1017
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:39,347
Who the hell are you?
Why do you want to expose me?!

1018
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,474
I'm Jin Hu.

1019
01:39:40,515 --> 01:39:43,768
My father, Jin Keqiang,
committed suicide because of you!

1020
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:45,770
Jin Keqiang?

1021
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:48,482
I've never gambled with him! Really!

1022
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:49,941
Oh?

1023
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,251
He sold his house
to Yamamoto through me.

1024
01:40:08,376 --> 01:40:12,255
I don't know anything
about him jumping to his death.

1025
01:40:12,297 --> 01:40:13,924
You telling me the truth?

1026
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:15,967
Everything I said is true.

1027
01:40:16,009 --> 01:40:18,094
Kill me, cut me to pieces,
do whatever you want.

1028
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:22,682
Fine. I'll let you go this one time.

1029
01:40:22,807 --> 01:40:25,101
Never be a cheat again.

1030
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,523
Go home.
Emi is waiting for you.

1031
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:31,650
I promise you.

1032
01:40:47,415 --> 01:40:51,586
Where's the money?

1033
01:41:13,441 --> 01:41:15,860
Yoshida, stop fighting!

1034
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:18,697
Your wife and daughter
are looking for you everywhere.

1035
01:41:18,738 --> 01:41:21,157
You're lying!
They're both in Hokkaido.

1036
01:41:21,283 --> 01:41:22,742
I'm Ayako's friend.

1037
01:41:22,784 --> 01:41:24,286
I sent someone to get her.

1038
01:41:24,327 --> 01:41:25,870
She'll be here soon.

1039
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,501
I only want you
to help me as a witness.

1040
01:41:31,626 --> 01:41:35,880
Prove that Yamamoto's cheating
and that he sent you to kill me.

1041
01:41:47,934 --> 01:41:52,063
Yamamoto, killing Nine-fingered Ichiro
was useless.

1042
01:41:52,188 --> 01:41:55,650
This club of yours is a scam.

1043
01:41:55,775 --> 01:41:58,194
A scam? What?
Give us the money back!

1044
01:41:58,194 --> 01:42:00,030
Show us the money!

1045
01:42:00,071 --> 01:42:02,490
Everyone,
it's all a misunderstanding.

1046
01:42:02,616 --> 01:42:04,326
We've been running
for over 10 years

1047
01:42:04,409 --> 01:42:05,785
and nothing like this
has ever happened.

1048
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:08,204
I've entrusted the money with Reiko.

1049
01:42:08,246 --> 01:42:09,789
She must've gone out.

1050
01:42:09,914 --> 01:42:12,417
When she returns,
you'll see the money.

1051
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,753
We don't believe you!
Give us the money back now!

1052
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:19,382
Everyone, Yoshida can
tell you it's a scam.

1053
01:42:21,551 --> 01:42:26,056
Yamamoto, he confessed
that you sent him to kill me.

1054
01:42:26,139 --> 01:42:28,099
What? There's that, too?

1055
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:29,684
He opens a casino to kill people?

1056
01:42:29,726 --> 01:42:31,019
This is absurd!

1057
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,520
Give us the money
or there's going to be trouble.

1058
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,688
You dare betray me?!

1059
01:42:36,941 --> 01:42:38,276
Put the gun down!

1060
01:42:40,528 --> 01:42:42,238
I'm Officer Miyamoto.

1061
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:44,532
You're under arrest!

1062
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:47,410
No one leaves this place alive!

1063
01:43:33,873 --> 01:43:36,292
Hello, hello...

1064
01:43:36,292 --> 01:43:39,879
Kyushu. No. 47 Miyamoto,
calling Kyoto.

1065
01:43:51,307 --> 01:43:52,475
Send the men!

1066
01:43:52,475 --> 01:43:53,601
Inside!

1067
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:58,314
Stay calm. We won't get involved.

1068
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:50,033
Han Ming!

1069
01:45:22,023 --> 01:45:23,274
Han Ming!

1070
01:45:25,109 --> 01:45:27,445
Han Ming! Han Ming!

1071
01:45:54,848 --> 01:45:57,183
Talk!
How did you kill my father?

1072
01:45:57,308 --> 01:45:58,852
It wasn't me!

1073
01:46:00,478 --> 01:46:01,729
It wasn't me!

1074
01:46:02,021 --> 01:46:03,898
It was Shimizu...

1075
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:07,318
Get ready!

1076
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:08,671
Hold it! Nobody moves!

1077
01:47:08,796 --> 01:47:11,925
- No one moves!
- Everyone, hands in the air!

1078
01:47:11,966 --> 01:47:13,968
Quickly!

1079
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:15,803
You came at the right time.

1080
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:17,722
I'm Officer Miyamoto.

1081
01:47:17,805 --> 01:47:20,391
No one is allowed to leave.

1082
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:23,353
Carry away the dead
and the wounded.

1083
01:47:23,686 --> 01:47:25,229
Sir!

1084
01:47:25,563 --> 01:47:27,690
- You, go and prepare the stretchers.
- Sir!

1085
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:29,525
Arrest these thugs.

1086
01:47:29,567 --> 01:47:30,818
Everyone, form a line!

1087
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,404
Go over there. Let's go!

1088
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:51,589
Father!

1089
01:49:47,872 --> 01:49:50,708
- Mr Jin, are you alright?
- Are you badly hurt?

1090
01:49:52,627 --> 01:49:54,587
Will you be alright?

1091
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:57,840
It's not much. I'll be alright.

1092
01:50:05,431 --> 01:50:07,892
Thanks to this for protecting me.

1093
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:16,734
Where's Shimizu?

1094
01:50:24,992 --> 01:50:28,287
Oh my, almost turned
into mincemeat.

1095
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:42,385
Officer Miyamoto, you saw
how everything went down.

1096
01:50:42,468 --> 01:50:45,596
I hope you'll give me a fair trial.

1097
01:50:46,305 --> 01:50:47,598
Of course.

1098
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:50,017
The police have been watching
this place for a while now.

1099
01:50:50,059 --> 01:50:52,770
I was disguised as a guest to investigate.

1100
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:57,316
Officer Miyamoto, the 700 million
from the casino - I have it all.

1101
01:50:57,358 --> 01:50:59,026
But I have one request.

1102
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,988
The 80 million they cheated
off my father

1103
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:04,407
were donations from
overseas Chinese compatriots.

1104
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:06,409
I hope you can return it to me.

1105
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:10,121
You must have proof
and recover it legally.

1106
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:12,331
We'll give you back what is yours.

1107
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:14,750
My father never gambled.

1108
01:51:14,792 --> 01:51:17,753
They were the ones who ruined him.

1109
01:51:17,795 --> 01:51:20,882
I hope you'll clear his name.

1110
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:25,303
Alright, I'll share all the details
with the press.

1111
01:51:25,887 --> 01:51:27,305
Thank you.

1112
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:34,937
Miss Emi, I must apologise to you.

1113
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:38,316
I took your father for a cheat.

1114
01:51:38,733 --> 01:51:41,152
The Nine-fingered Ichiro I saw today...

1115
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:42,987
was not your father.

1116
01:51:57,335 --> 01:51:58,711
Don't be sad anymore.

1117
01:51:58,794 --> 01:52:02,506
Your father died an honest man.

1118
01:52:04,383 --> 01:52:09,555
Before I found him,
I was so hopeful.

1119
01:52:10,306 --> 01:52:12,600
Now I feel nothing but despair.

1120
01:52:15,394 --> 01:52:17,104
Don't say that.

1121
01:52:17,188 --> 01:52:19,148
You now have many friends.

1122
01:52:19,148 --> 01:52:21,108
They'll take care of you.

1123
01:52:25,738 --> 01:52:29,533
<i>When you've lost your love</i>

1124
01:52:29,575 --> 01:52:32,954
<i>and he's forever gone,</i>

1125
01:52:33,037 --> 01:52:41,963
<i>you will know what sorrow is.</i>
