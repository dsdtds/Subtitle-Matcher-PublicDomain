00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,505
(bold orchestral music)

4
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:32,561
(upbeat swing music)

5
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:03,961
(triumphant orchestral music)

6
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:25,937
- Hello, Miss Simmons.

7
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:26,872
- Hello.
- Hi, Mary.

8
00:01:26,872 --> 00:01:28,225
- Hello, Mr. Haskell.

9
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:29,107
- Here's your shirts, Jimmy.

10
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:29,940
I turned the cuffs.

11
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,857
- Oh, thanks very much.

12
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,094
- It's little enough for
letting Mary come here

13
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,112
and practice every day.

14
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:37,207
- Ah, it's all right.

15
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:38,392
- How's she doing?

16
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:39,679
- Ah, just don't you discourage her.

17
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:40,706
She keeps up this practice

18
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:43,048
and she'll be able to play real good.

19
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:43,979
- I'll be back in an hour.

20
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,396
- Okay, I'll take good care of her.

21
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:47,969
All right, hop to it, Mary.

22
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,969
(complex classical piano music)

23
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,590
Mary uh, gimme an A, will ya.

(single piano keys striking)
(banjo string syncs)

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,371
That's it. Okay, thanks.

26
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:15,371
(complex classical piano music)

27
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,216
- Hey, Jimmy, when you going
to get some new records?

28
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,321
- Well, you kids haven't quite
worn out the old ones, yet.

29
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:24,361
- [Boy] Won't be long, now.

30
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,194
- Hi, Tommy.

31
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:27,446
- Here's some eggs for
my last lesson, Jimmy.

32
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:28,767
Tomorrow, I'll bring the bacon.

33
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,554
- Okay, here's your horn.

34
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:33,260
I think you left your music
over there some place.

35
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,260
(complex classical piano music)

36
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,730
(rousing horn music)

37
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,814
(big band music)

38
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:02,283
(lively harmonica music)

39
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:08,947
(random harmonica blasts)

40
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,344
Well, Uncle Charlie,
hello. Glad to see you.

41
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:19,567
- Hello, Jimmy, I'm glad to see you, too.

42
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,618
- Well, this is quite a surprise.

43
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,107
What brings you up in
this neck of the woods?

44
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:24,150
- Well, I came up to see you,

45
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,524
since you didn't take the
trouble to answer my letter.

46
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:29,052
- Letter? Oh, well, I wanted a
little time to think it over.

47
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,805
Well, come on in, Uncle Charlie.

48
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,472
(chaotic music)

49
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,143
- I, I, I wrote you.

50
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,079
I wrote you three months ago.

51
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,668
- Oh, is it that long?

52
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,743
I don't know, you know how it is,

53
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,223
a fellow gets busy and everything.

54
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,011
Now these, these things in dry weather,

55
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,774
you have to change the oil
every thousand miles on it.

56
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,658
(chaotic music)

57
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:51,594
Now that does it.

58
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:54,334
(jaunty harmonica music)

59
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,003
- Jimmy? Jimmy!

60
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,921
I came up to have an
important talk with you.

61
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,867
- Go ahead, go ahead, I'm listening.

62
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:01,951
Go ahead.

63
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,839
- Can't we go some place
without this infernal racket?

64
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,093
- Oh, oh, yeah. We'll go
right in my room, there.

65
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:08,926
- Where?

66
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:09,759
- Right, right over there.

67
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,592
- Oh!

68
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:13,509
(lively orchestral music)

69
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:14,676
- Here we are.

70
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:18,408
Oh, not that chair, Uncle Charlie.

71
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:19,472
That needs a little fixin'

72
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:23,798
I took it in on a trade
for a second-hand clarinet.

73
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:27,248
- Jimmy, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

74
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:30,216
As you know, you and I
have not been very close.

75
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,206
After all, we are the
last of the Haskells.

76
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,426
- Oh, is that very serious?

77
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:35,313
- It is to me.

78
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:36,973
I want to keep the name of Haskell

79
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,649
in the health-food business.

80
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:41,239
- Yeah, well, I understand
how you feel, Uncle Charlie.

81
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,749
I wanna keep the name of
Haskell in the music business.

82
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,073
- I'm talking about big business.

83
00:04:46,073 --> 00:04:48,373
Can't you understand?

84
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:50,493
I need you, Jimmy.

85
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:54,081
Someday, you're going to
get everything I've got.

86
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,013
But you're not going to
get it if you persist

87
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:59,171
in frittering your life away in this town,

88
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,671
this whistle stop.

89
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:05,024
- I like it here.

90
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:07,045
My dad was happy here.

91
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,994
- Oh, I could never understand my brother.

92
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:12,208
And I told him when he opened this place

93
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,861
he'd never make a go of it.

94
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,856
- Well, he kept it fairly
successfully for 25 years,

95
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,106
that's not bad.

96
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,504
- If he'd listened to
me, he'd been a rich man.

97
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:25,320
But, no. So what did he have when he died?

98
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,690
- The biggest funeral this town ever saw.

99
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,843
Everybody was there.

100
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:31,254
- Why not? Everybody owed him money.

101
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,646
- Maybe so.

102
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:35,815
Dad just had a wonderful
time living. He liked things.

103
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,126
He liked to hunt and fish. He liked music.

104
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:39,897
- [Charlie] Music!

105
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:42,568
- Yeah he, he talked a
great deal about you.

106
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,164
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,643
Always seemed to feel so sorry for you.

108
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:47,893
- Sorry for me?

109
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:51,398
- You didn't get anything out
of life, just making money.

110
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:52,864
- Is that so?

111
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:54,801
Since when has making money been a crime?

112
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:55,651
Since when?

113
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,757
Oh, I'm not going to argue with you.

114
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:00,794
And I'm not going to let myself be upset!

115
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,841
No sir!

116
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:02,674
(wood crumbles)

117
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:03,757
Jimmy! Jimmy!

118
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,061
- Uncle, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:08,848
- Oh, don't hit him,
Jimmy, he's an old man.

120
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,391
- Oh, no, it was just the chair, you see?

121
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,591
Are you hurt, Uncle Charlie?

122
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:13,648
- Oh, don't mind me.

123
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:14,481
- [Jimmy] Oh, hello, Bud.

124
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,638
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

125
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:17,098
- Oh, yeah, well, outside here.

126
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:20,681
Will you excuse me a
minute, Uncle Charlie?

127
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,915
- Afraid I've got some
bad news for you, Jimmy.

128
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,284
- Well, what's the trouble, Bud?

129
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,402
- I'm suppose to tack up this attachment

130
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,896
unless you can dig up some money.

131
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:31,668
- Oh. Well, I guess
you have to tack it up.

132
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,165
Unless you think eggs are
gonna go up to $500 a dozen

133
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,783
all of a sudden.

134
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:37,083
- Well, see what you can do.

135
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,593
I'll hold this off as long as I can.

136
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:40,426
- Okay, thanks, Buddy.

137
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,550
Oh, that was uh,

138
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,309
uh, he was just tellin'
me about some people

139
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:50,623
that wanted some musical instruments.

140
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,276
- He's the sheriff, isn't he?

141
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:53,109
- How'd you know?

142
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:54,562
- I knew his father.

143
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,826
He was serving a paper on your father

144
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:57,501
the first time I came up here.

145
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,626
- That's right.

146
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,425
- Well, Jimmy, what's it gonna be?

147
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,639
You can stay here chasing
rainbows or you can come with me.

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,396
I can show you a real pot o' gold

149
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:06,026
that's yours for the taking.

150
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:06,859
- Well, I, I. .

151
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,028
- Wait a minute.

152
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:12,097
That's a good idea for my
radio program tomorrow night.

153
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,940
You've heard my "Happiness
Hour," of course?

154
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,688
- Oh, yes, everybody's heard that. Once.

155
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,291
- Listen to this.

156
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,557
The clouds that make the day so gray

157
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:23,083
must sooner or later pass away.

158
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,087
There's always a pot o' gold
at the end of the rainbow.

159
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,510
Good ol' homespun philosophy.

160
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,343
- Oh, boy.

161
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,530
- Well, I've got to be going.

162
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,133
What are you going to do?

163
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,514
- Well, I'll tell ya, Uncle Charlie, I,

164
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,468
unless a miracle happens
in the next few days,

165
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,811
looks like I'll slide down that rainbow.

166
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,644
- Fine.

167
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:46,894
- Land right in the pot.

168
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,517
(horns honking)

169
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:55,301
- Uh, what, what was I saying?

170
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:56,466
- And furthermore. .

171
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:58,964
- And furthermore, I see no
reason to change the old. .

172
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:00,511
(loud boom)

173
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,798
What was I saying?

174
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:02,776
- And furthermore. .

175
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,797
- And furthermore, I see no
reason for changing the air guns

176
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:09,074
we are now using to puff
our rice and other cereals.

177
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,499
(loud boom)

178
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:14,478
Our present air guns are
exceptionally quiet in operation.

179
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:15,615
I therefore would suggest that. .

180
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,110
(big band music)

181
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,360
There goes that band again.

182
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,989
Oh, I'll fix this.

183
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:27,739
(big band music)

184
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,794
How can a man transact any business

185
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,674
with that going on day after day?

186
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:41,816
Tom-toms, jungle screeches,
they're a menace to sanity.

187
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:42,751
(loud boom)

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,584
What did I say?

189
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,156
- Tom-toms and jungle screeches.

190
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:47,015
- No, no, but that's what I mean.

191
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,785
The McCorkles took that
band in their house

192
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:50,590
just to annoy me.

193
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,276
That's why they've ignored
all of my protests.

194
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:55,446
- Well, I understand it's
a new band just organized.

195
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,155
- Who wants a new band?

196
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,096
Let 'em organize in a cave somewhere.

197
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:00,212
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

198
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:01,188
(imitates Indian war whoops)

199
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:02,021
(loud boom)

200
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:03,940
I'll settle this once and for all.

201
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,441
(big band music)

202
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:07,274
Hey!

203
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,148
Hey, you!

204
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:11,878
Hey!

205
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:12,711
(Charlie clapping)

206
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:13,824
Hey, you!

207
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,407
Hey, somebody, hey!

208
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,419
Hey, hey!

209
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:20,128
- What's the matter?

210
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:24,321
- Stop that, that blasted
bedlam or I'll have it stopped!

211
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,771
- Oh, you will, eh?

212
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,557
Ha, you and who else?

213
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:28,705
- The police.

214
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:31,939
I'll have that gang of
noisy loafers thrown in jail

215
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,415
for disturbing the peace!

216
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,115
- Disturbin' the peace, are we?

217
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,181
(loud boom)

218
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:41,598
What about that air gun of
yours, boomin' all day and night?

219
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:44,218
I suppose that's a baby's lullaby,

220
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,215
you white-headed old baboon.

221
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:47,851
(loud boom)
(crowd laughs)

222
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,535
- That boomin' is business.

223
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,099
And besides, we're all used to it.

224
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:52,297
- The band is business.

225
00:09:52,297 --> 00:09:55,065
And you'll get used to it too
or it's your own hard luck.

226
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:56,581
- I'll get out an injunction.

227
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,097
- Oh, you will, 'eh?

228
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,131
Well, listen, you
black-hearted old skinflint.

229
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,761
For years, you've tried every trick

230
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:04,568
to make me sell my house here,

231
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,478
so you could enlarge your factory.

232
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:09,511
Well, I'm not sellin'
Haskell, not at your price.

233
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:11,848
So go ahead, call the cops if you think

234
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,121
you can have this band thrown outta here.

235
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:17,507
- You just wait, you'll find out.

236
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:21,897
(descending notes trombone)
(crowd laughs)

237
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:24,106
- Go ahead, boys, go to
it, but loud. (laughs)

238
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,020
(big band music)

239
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,184
- Jasper!

240
00:10:26,184 --> 00:10:27,351
Go get Jasper.

241
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:29,664
Jasper! Jasper!

242
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,226
Go get him, find him, don't
stand there like a dummy.

243
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:34,889
Do I have to do everything
myself around here?

244
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,101
Jasper! Jasper!

245
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:36,934
- Do you want me, CJ?

246
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,911
- Do I want you? Why aren't
you here when I need you?

247
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,081
Go get the police.

248
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:41,978
- The police, CJ?

249
00:10:41,978 --> 00:10:43,720
- The militia, if necessary.

250
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,914
That McCorkle woman has
insulted me for the last time.

251
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:47,914
- But you've said that before, CJ.

252
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,767
- I know, but this time I mean it.

253
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,035
That band is driving me insane.

254
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,177
- It certainly is.

255
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,838
- Well, have 'em arrested.

256
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:56,671
- I will.

257
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:57,504
- Good!

258
00:10:57,504 --> 00:11:00,254

do for the McCorkles.

I'll take a half a dozen.

283
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:05,327
Here, Willie.

284
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,494

00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,214
Here, stupid.

288
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:14,381
Well, take it.

289
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:17,936
Thank you.

290
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:19,826
Come on.

291
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:24,741
Too bad you can't carry a few
bundles without complaining.

292
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:26,914
- Oh, I don't mind carrying them.

293
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,620
- Well, who are you?

294
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,461
- I'm the guy carrying the bundles.

295
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,660
- (chuckles) Well, thanks.

296
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,030
I thought my brother Willie was behind me.

297
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,036
- Oh, no, no he went ahead of you.

298
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:38,440
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

299
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,491
(laughing) You must've been surprised.

300
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:41,930
- No, no, I guess life in the big city's

301
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,968
just one big surprise after the other.

302
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:44,801
- For instance?

303
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,948
- Well, for instance, band
music comin' down outta the sky

304
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,542
in broad daylight.

305
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,120
- Oh, that. That's up on our roof.

306
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,031
- On your roof, is it?

307
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:54,126
- The band is strictly on the
house. Until we get a job.

308
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,500
- Oh, well, you with the band?

309
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,087
- Well, my sister Donna
and I sing with it.

310
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:59,032
My brother plays in it
but Mother feeds it.

311
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:01,410
- Oh, well it certainly
is a swell band all right.

312
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,840
- There's a slight difference
of opinion around here

313
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,673
about that.

314
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,358
- Oh, you mean the neighbors object?

315
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:08,176
- Oh, no, the neighbors are all. .

316
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,343
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

317
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:13,895
- Well, Miss McCorkle, as you can see,

318
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:14,867
I'm here with the law.

319
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:15,792
- For protection, huh?

320
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:18,803
- Certainly not. We are here
to give you the last warning.

321
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:21,628
That music must cease,
definitely once and for all.

322
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:22,912
- I'm comin' Molly.

323
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:26,488
What does this weasel want
this time? As if I didn't know.

324
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:29,812
- No violence, now. Speak to her, officer.

325
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:30,689
- Hello, Mom.

326
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:31,785
(crowd chuckles)

327
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:32,696
- You've been in bad company, Mac.

328
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,246
- Well, I've been sent
to deliver an ultimatum.

329
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,518
- Oh, ye have, have ye?

330
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:36,863
- Yes, and this band must go.

331
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,066
They're disturbing the peace
of the entire neighborhood.

332
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,839
- Oh, the entire neighborhood?

333
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,041
Does it disturb you, Mrs. Poppadolis?

334
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,349
- Not-a me, it-a keeps me young.

335
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:47,853
- Disturbin' the peace.

336
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:49,649
What about you, Mrs. Sweeney?

337
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,222
- It's a big advantage to me.

338
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,575
My old man can't fight
when he hears music.

339
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,029
(crowd laughs)

340
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:57,963
- They will, will they?

341
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,311
The hoodlums, they're ruffians.

342
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:01,678
- Now, go back to your kennel

343
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:04,022
and tell Old Man Haskell
what you've heard.

344
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:04,855
Go on now.

345
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,371
(crowd grumbling)
- Hey! Hey!

346
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,028
- Hey, what's goin' on here?

347
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:09,499
- You've heard about the
feud between the Hatfields

348
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:10,431
and the McCoys, haven't you?

349
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,536
- Yeah.

350
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:12,369
- Well, this is the one

351
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:14,470
between the McCorkles and the Haskells.

352
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,303
- What'd you say? Who?

353
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,934
- Come on.

354
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,055
- [Jasper] Officer, do something!

355
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:18,888
- Hey, what are you doing?

356
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,590
- I'm looking for a nice soft one.

357
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,099
(crowd grumbling)

358
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:24,485
- [Jasper] Oh, quit kicking
me, quit kicking me!

359
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,318
- Look out.

360
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,721
- Now, just a minute, just a minute.

361
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,637
You might miss him.
- Ow! Ow!

362
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,995
- Down.

363
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:35,591
- Oh, you hoodlums, you'll
pay for this, you hoodlums.

364
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:37,148
- Now!

365
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,074
- Stand aside, Jasper.

366
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:40,755
(crowd laughter)

367
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,773
- Gosh, I hit the wrong man.

368
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:45,219
- Oh, no you didn't. You
hit the right man. Run!

369
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,052
- Well, wait, the. .

370
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:46,885
- Come on!

371
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,199
(crowd laughing)

372
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,750
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, it's blood.

373
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,027
I've been shot, I've been stabbed!

374
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,868
- You're all right, CJ, take it easy.

375
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:58,268
- No, I'm not all right. Call
a doctor, call an ambulance.

376
00:14:58,268 --> 00:15:00,371
- But that isn't blood, CJ.

377
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:01,423
- It isn't blood?

378
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,476
Well, what is it, what is it?

379
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:03,645
- Tomato juice.
(crowd laughing)

380
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:06,933
Somebody hit you with a tomato.

381
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,100
- All's clear, come on in.

382
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:15,101
- Whew. Boy, you sure do know
your backyards and fences.

383
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,241
- Oh, I'd have made better time yet

384
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:17,542
if I hadn't had to wait for you.

385
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,875
- Well, I didn't wanna ask
you to carry my suitcase.

386
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,352
- Have a doughnut, hero,
the best I can offer.

387
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:26,891
- Well, thanks. Hero? Me?

388
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:28,244
- You certainly are.

389
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:29,814
You know, I wouldn't be
surprised if they put up a statue

390
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,201
of you throwing that tomato.

391
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:32,625
You know, like the discus fellow?

392
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,024
- Oh, well, that was an accident.

393
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,048
Hitting my, uh, that man.

394
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:38,317
- Accident? That was a stroke of genius.

395
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,850
If you only knew how everybody
hates Old Man Haskell.

396
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,833
- They do, why?

397
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,812
- Why?

398
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:44,814
I could give you a reason
for every dollar he's got

399
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:45,647
in the bank.

400
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,233
Do you know that he tried
to drive us out of our home

401
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,376
because he doesn't like music?

402
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,539
- He's sort of a stinker, isn't he?

403
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:51,847
- And how.

404
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:54,788
Believe me, the name of Haskell's
pure poison around here.

405
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:55,621
- It is?

406
00:15:58,511 --> 00:15:59,344
Well.

407
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:03,681
Guess I better be going.

408
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,544
- Oh, what's your hurry?

409
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:05,972
- Well, I have to find a place to live.

410
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,914
I sort of expected to live
with a relative of mine,

411
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:10,052
but it doesn't seem like
a very good idea now.

412
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,889
- Well, if you'd like a place

413
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:11,800
where there's never a dull moment,

414
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,636
what's the matter with this?

415
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:14,827
- Well, I didn't know. .
- Molly, are ye going?

416
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:16,285
What's goin' on here?

417
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,355
Who are you and what do you want?

418
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:18,598
- Mom, he's looking for a place to live.

419
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:20,233
- Oh, are you a new member of the band

420
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,358
or will you be livin'
here on a cash basis?

421
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,075
- Mom, this is the fellow
that hit Old Man Haskell

422
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:25,242
with a tomato.

423
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:27,958
- Oh, glory be.

424
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,713
(laughing) Oh, you darlin'
Why didn't you tell me?

425
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:33,973
So, you're the fellow? (laughs)

426
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,158
Now, listen young man.

427
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:36,416
You're not lookin' any further.

428
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,954
You're gonna live right here with us.

429
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:39,100
Here, give me the bag.

430
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,214
- Well, that's very nice of you but. .

431
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,618
- There'll be no buts now.

432
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,153
Why the best room in the house
is none too good for you,

433
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:45,617
whether you can pay for it or not.

434
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,015
Come on now, gimme the bag.
- Well, well here, I'll. .

435
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:47,964
- You're not leavin'

436
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:48,797
this house.
- I'll take the bag.

437
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:51,148
- [Mary] Willie! Willie, where are you?

438
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:52,426
- Hey, Molly, been lookin' for you.

439
00:16:52,426 --> 00:16:53,814
I have that arrangement finished.

440
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:54,762
- [Molly] Oh, fine.

441
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:55,595
Can we try it?
- Right now.

442
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,181
- I want you to take this
bag up to the big room.

443
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,747
- Can't anybody besides
me ever carry anything?

444
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,910
- Go on with ye, now,
you're always grumblin'

445
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,743
- [Willie] I'm not grumbling.

446
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:03,968
- Lemme see it, Horace.

447
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,655
- Gee, these changes are swell.

448
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:07,322

beat out by the garbage dumps.

500
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,786
A little argument with Old Man Haskell.

been here a little while ago,

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,664
you'd have been even for life.

504
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:36,912
- Yeah, what happened?

505
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:38,344

507
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,599

call it poetic justice.

00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,093
- It must have been good.

509
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,058

came steaming over here.

- Yeah?

514
00:20:52,506 --> 00:20:54,071

516
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:57,344

- No, nobody but me.

524
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,483
But I'm big-hearted.

525

shake the hand of the man

(drown out by group talking excitedly)

528
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:25,360

529
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,962
to keep your big mouth shut?

530
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,069
- What did I say?

531
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:29,986
- Too much.

532
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:34,163
Open up, boys, open up, open up.

533
00:21:34,163 --> 00:21:35,741
Open up.

534
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,165
My boy, you should have a medal.

535
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,099
Yes, sir, I'm sorry I
can't be giving you one

536
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,096
instead of this.

537
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:43,844
- Oh, thanks very much.

538
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,677
What is it?

539
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,491
- It's a warrant for assault and battery.

540
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:49,180
Old Man Haskell swore it out.

541
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,404
- [Jimmy] Mm-hmm.

542
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:52,071
- Come on, son.
- Hm?

543
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,614
- Wait. Wait a minute.

544
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:57,447
Grady.

545
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:01,758
Wouldn't you like to
give me a good swift kick

546
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,248
before you go?

547
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:04,636
- Oh, no, that's all right.

548
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:06,226
This has been fun, here.

549
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,726
And I enjoyed jumpin' over
those fences with you.

550
00:22:08,726 --> 00:22:10,436
If I ever get this thing straightened out,

551
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:13,623
I hope you'll let me come back some time.

552
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:18,623
And uh, oh, thanks for that
doughnut. That was all right.

553
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:21,445
Eh, well, come on Grady.

554
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,278
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

555
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:25,799
(gavel banging)

556
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,132
- The next case.

557
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,012
- Hold everything, judge,
we'll be right there.

558
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:32,384
Molly, where are you?
(gavel banging)

559
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,966
Come on, hurry up, the case has started.

560
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:37,087
- Order, order in the courtroom.

561
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,087
Mary McCorkle, sit down.

562
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,100
- Now listen, Mike,

563
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,623
don't you be gettin' on
your high horse with me.

564
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,979
- Sit down.

565
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,562
(man chuckles)

566
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:51,300
Now what's this case all about?

567
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,599
Young man, what's your name?

568
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,793
- My name?

569
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:57,742
- [Judge] I'd prefer your real name.

570
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:58,575
- Uh-huh.

571
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:02,928
Uh, oh, my name is James Hamilton.

572
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,343
- James Hamilton?

573
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:08,960
Yeah, put that down.

574
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,554
And where do you live, James Hamilton?

575
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:13,496
- He lives with us at my house.

576
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:14,996
- 419 63rd Street.

577
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:19,488
Now, tell me, James,
how did you get enmeshed

578
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,488
in the coils of the law?

579
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:25,410
- I threw a tomato.

580
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,501
(gallery laughs and claps)

581
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,551
- He's too modest, Mike. (laughs)

582
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,997
He made a bulls-eye right
in Old Man Haskell's face.

583
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,755
- He did? (laughs)

584
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:39,936
(gallery laughs)
(gavel banging)

585
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:41,148
Uh, where were we?

586
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:43,179
- I'd just thrown the tomato, your honor.

587
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,914
- Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

588
00:23:45,914 --> 00:23:49,084
And now tell me, Jimmy, my boy,

589
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:51,786
did you with premeditation and intent,

590
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:55,175
deliberately aim at the
aforesaid Haskell's face?

591
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:56,259
- Well. .

592
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,127
- And the defendant refuses
to answer on the grounds

593
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:01,765
that he might incriminate himself.

594
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:04,918
- Glory be, Mike, you
certainly know the law.

595
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:07,421
- Having weighed the evidence,

596
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,786
the court rules that the case be postponed

597
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:13,619
and the defendant release on bail.

598
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,773
Provided anybody has any money.

599
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:19,552
- We have $200. Is that enough?

600
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:23,573
- That was the exact sum
that the court had in mind.

601
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:24,674
Who has it?

602
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:26,123
- I have it, your honor.

603
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:28,373
- The clerk will accept it.

604
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:30,560
(gavel bangs)

605
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,644
Next case.

606
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:32,563
- Thank you, Mike.

607
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:34,169
- Stand aside, please.

608
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:35,324
Will you move over?

609
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:36,546
- All right, who ya pushin'?

610
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:37,467
- [Charlie] I'm not pushing you.

611
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,627
- Take it easy, will ya?
- Hey, wait a minute.

612
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:40,561
- Don't you push me.

613
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:42,641
- Here comes double pneumonia.

614
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:45,553
Open the windows, boys,
I smell stale tomatoes.

615
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:47,096
(crowd laughs)

616
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:49,662
- Very funny, Mrs. McCorkle, very funny.

617
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,475
I only wish it had been
you that threw that tomato.

618
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:54,914
- So do I, only I'd-a put a rock in it.

619
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:56,292
- Oh, you would?

620
00:24:56,292 --> 00:25:00,292
Well let me tell. .
(gavel bangs)

621
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:04,154
Proceed with the case, judge. I'm here.

622
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,687
Where's the man that assaulted me?

623
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:08,066
- [Judge] If you don't
mind, I'll conduct this case

624
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:10,199
without any advice from you.

625
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:12,032
- [Mrs. McCorkle] That's
tellin' him, Mike.

626
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:17,032
(crowd laughs)
(gavel bangs)

627
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:23,216
(car engine rumbling)

628
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:28,919
- Move along, in you go.

629
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:36,098
All right, take it away, Eddie.

630
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:42,949
- I bring a legitimate
charge against a hoodlum.

631
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:44,938
And before I can give my evidence,

632
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:47,470
the thug is permitted to walk
out right under your nose.

633
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,847
- In the first place,
he wasn't under my nose.

634
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:52,972
And in the second place, the
defendant was released on bail.

635
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,361
And the third place, you're
in contempt of court,

636
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:58,684
and I sentence you to 25 days or $25.

637
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,276
- [Mrs. McCorkle] Oh,
that ain't enough, Mike.

638
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,977
(gavel bangs)
- Quiet, quiet.

639
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,976
- This is an outrage.

640
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:05,512
It's, it's a travesty on justice.

641
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,363
- $50 or 50 days.

642
00:26:07,363 --> 00:26:09,188
- What?
- Make up your mind.

643
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:11,276
- It's worth 50 to tell you what I think.

644
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:12,638
- Is it worth a hundred?

645
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:16,462
- All right, but you wait
until the next election.

646
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:17,676
You wait until. .

647
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,451
- I'm waiting.

648
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:20,701
- Until the uh,

649
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:25,764
your honor, it appears that
I haven't any money with me.

650
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:26,994
- Take him away, bailiff.

651
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:28,205
- You can't do this to me!

652
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,733
- Court declares a recess.
(gavel banging)

653
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,921

- Come on. Come on.

00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:06,971
(men murmuring quietly)

885
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:15,134
- Thank you.

886
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:19,719
(silverware clinking)

887
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:21,470
- What's the matter?

888
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,387
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

889
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:27,559
Would you excuse me, I
don't feel very well.

890
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,880
- Oh, it's probably too much excitement.

891
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,233
- Yeah, maybe you're right.

892
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,918
The jail and everything,

893
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:32,795
Well, I think I'll be all right

894
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,197
if I could go out and get some fresh air.

895
00:36:34,197 --> 00:36:35,411
- Willie, you'd better go with him.

896
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:36,320
- Sure.

897
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,153
- Oh, well, you don't.

898
00:36:39,427 --> 00:36:41,227
Well, maybe I'd be better off
if I just went up to my room

899
00:36:41,227 --> 00:36:42,286
for a while.

900
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,468
- Willie, show him his room.

901
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:48,444
- Come on, Willie does everything
around here except eat.

902
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:51,444
- If you want anything, just holler.

903
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:54,520
- Home sweet home.

904
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
- Oh, thanks

905
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:57,970

933
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,587
- You'll be sorry for this.

934
00:38:12,587 --> 00:38:16,329
Look what they've done to my voice.

935
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:17,856
How am I going to broadcast

936
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,978

00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,126
- Well, would there be any complaints

938
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:22,633
if you just called the whole thing off?

939
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,466
- What?

940
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,824
- Tell 'em you lost your
voice singing in a jail.

941
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:27,657
- Don't be ridiculous!

942
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,192
- Ladies and gentlemen,
due to circumstances

943
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:32,169
beyond our control. .

944
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:33,169
- Oh, oh-oh.

945
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:36,353
- We again bring you the
"Haskell Hour of Happiness,"

946
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:38,795
with CJ Haskell, makers
of Haskell's patty cakes,

947
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,795
the health food supreme.

948
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:44,470
- Ladies and gentlemen. (coughs)

949
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,787
I can't do it, I'm sick, I'm croaking.

950
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:48,389
- You're all right,
you're all right. Come on.

951
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:49,222
- Jimmy, you do it for me.

952
00:38:49,222 --> 00:38:50,401
- Oh no, oh no.
- Oh, yes, oh, yes.

953
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:51,360
- Oh, none of that, no.

954
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,324
- Mr. Haskell will be
with you in just a moment.

955
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:55,991
- Sh, bring the microphone here.

956
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,009
- Ladies and gentlemen!

957
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,426
- Sh!
- Sh! Sh-sh.

958
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:06,578
- Tonight, I want to share
a little poem with you.

959
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,967
(clears throat) We, we
all should be grateful

960
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:11,764
and happy as kings.

961
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:15,290
The world is so full of
such wonderful things.

962
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,326
The rain and the sun help
the earth to grow wheat.

963
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:19,474
Perhaps its the most healthful. .

964
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:22,371
- Hey, Willie.
- of any cereal we eat.

965
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:23,346
- What do you want?

966
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:24,477
- Listen to this, will ya?

967
00:39:24,477 --> 00:39:26,845
- [Jimmy] The sun on the
ocean, sparkling and bright.

968
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:27,678
- Why do you wanna
listen to that stuff for?

969
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:28,919
- Just listen for a moment.
- The breeze in the trees

970
00:39:28,919 --> 00:39:31,147
and the planets at night.

971
00:39:31,147 --> 00:39:34,440
The pansies, the pansies and lilies,

972
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,561
the primrose so fickle,
they're ours to enjoy

973
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:39,301
without spending a nickel.

974
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:42,718
The pra. .
(Jimmy crashes)

975
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:55,756
- [Parks] Good evening, sir.

976
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:58,236
- Good evening, Parks.

977
00:39:58,236 --> 00:39:59,069
Parks?

978
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:04,359
Is the guest room in order?

979
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,066
- Certainly, sir.

980
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:08,320
- This is my nephew, Mr. James Haskell.

981
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,403
- Oh. How do you do, sir?

982
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,066
- Same to you.

983
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:16,626
- Pardon me, is your
luggage in the car, sir?

984
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:17,459
- Luggage?

985
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,485
Oh, I just had one suitcase
and I left that at. .

986
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:20,604
- What are you whispering about?

987
00:40:20,604 --> 00:40:22,565
- I don't know, you started it, sir.

988
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:23,954
- I lost my voice singing.

989
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,304
- Singing? You, sir?

990
00:40:25,304 --> 00:40:26,137
- Yes, I was. .

991
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:27,454
- I think I better go and get my suitcase.

992
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:29,467
- You won't need it, we
have everything here.

993
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:30,300
Come on.

994
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:36,292
Well, here you are, my boy.

995
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:38,365
This is all yours from now on.

996
00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:40,804
I'm so happy to have you with me at last.

997
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:42,976
- [Jimmy] Well, thank you, sir.

998
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:44,880
- In case you need
anything, it's right there.

999
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,434
- Well, that's fine.

1000
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,100
- We'll have breakfast at 7:30,

1001
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,852
then I'll take you over to the factory

1002
00:40:49,852 --> 00:40:51,461
and introduce you around.

1003
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:52,294
- Uh-huh.

1004
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:55,419
- Best of all, I'm going to put
you on the payroll (laughs)

1005
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,560
I don't imagine you've got much money.

1006
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,582
- Well, your cashier
cashed a check for me.

1007
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:02,250
- Your personal check?

1008
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,781
How much?

1009
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:05,525
- Oh, it was certified.

1010
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:08,881
$214, that's what was left
when I closed up shop.

1011
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,803
- Oh, well, that dismal episode

1012
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,132
is behind you forever, my boy.

1013
00:41:13,132 --> 00:41:15,532
Tomorrow is another day.

1014
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:18,255
With more music by the
McCorkles, probably.

1015
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:21,997
Jimmy, that old lady is deliberately

1016
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:23,780
trying to wreck my health.

1017
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,637
- But why?

1018
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,699
- Just because I want her property.

1019
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:27,969
- Oh, that's very unreasonable.

1020
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,924
- Yeah, it's getting on my nerves,

1021
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,954
I can't stand it any longer.

1022
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:34,931
- Well, Uncle Charlie, why
don't you go on a vacation?

1023
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:37,634
- And let the McCorkles
think that they're chasing me

1024
00:41:37,634 --> 00:41:38,477
out of town?

1025
00:41:38,477 --> 00:41:40,827
That's just what they want.

1026
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:43,046
Nothing is going to stand in the way

1027
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:47,213
of my getting the man who
hit me with that tomato.

1028
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,558
This is my room if you want me.

1029
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:58,611
I'm going to take a hot bath
and a hot toddy and go to bed.

1030
00:41:58,611 --> 00:41:59,937
Goodnight, Jim.

1031
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:01,009

tell ya, he's my uncle.

Well, here, I'll prove it to you.

1110
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:15,867
Here's a letter he sent me.

1111
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:17,918
To James Hamilton Haskell, that's me.

1112
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:18,751
Here, you wanna read it?

1113
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:20,094
- No, I'd rather not.

1114
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:22,684
- Say, what is this?
What are you doing here?

1115
00:47:22,684 --> 00:47:25,278
- Oh, well I almost
forget what I came for.

1116
00:47:25,278 --> 00:47:26,481
In the first place, there's $200.

1117
00:47:26,481 --> 00:47:27,576
Now you can get your
instruments outta hock.

1118
00:47:27,576 --> 00:47:29,053
- Did you get that from your uncle?

1119
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,054
- You don't know my uncle.

1120
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:31,887
- Thanks, Jim.

1121
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:33,409
- That's all right, that's all right.

1122
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,496
I like the people in this house.

1123
00:47:35,496 --> 00:47:37,390
'Specially, well, I like everybody.

1124
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,285
I'd sorta like to live here all the time.

1125
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:42,366
But, soon as Molly finds out who I am,

1126
00:47:42,366 --> 00:47:44,254
she'll kick me out in the alley, so I. .

1127
00:47:44,254 --> 00:47:45,584
- Well, suppose she doesn't find out.

1128
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:46,744
- Well, that'd be very nice but. .

1129
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,222
- Now, look, you've been regular.

1130
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:50,154
You didn't have to come
across with that dough.

1131
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:51,232
I'm for you, Jimmy.

1132
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:52,210
How 'bout you, Horace?

1133
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,043
- Sure thing, I'm for you.

1134
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:56,390
- Well, thanks very much, I just.

1135
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,635
No, I, I still got troubles.

1136
00:47:58,635 --> 00:47:59,689
Don't you see, sooner or later,

1137
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:01,700
Molly's gonna find out who I am.

1138
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,639
Just like sooner or later Old
Man Haskell's gonna find out

1139
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:05,911
who threw that tomato.

1140
00:48:05,911 --> 00:48:08,173
And it, it just won't work.

1141
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:10,157
Either way, I'm a dead duck.

1142
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:12,338
- Look, how's your uncle gonna find out?

1143
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,485
- Well, he'll see me
at the trial, won't he?

1144
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:16,161
- What would happen if
Uncle Charlie didn't show up

1145
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:16,994
for the trial?

1146
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,912
- They'd throw the case outta court.

1147
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:21,474
- Well, there's your answer.
We get rid of Uncle Charlie.

1148
00:48:21,474 --> 00:48:22,363
- How?

1149
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:24,950
- Well, we'll let Red run
over him with the ice wagon.

1150
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,783
- Oh, do you think he'd do it?

1151
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:27,390
Oh, you couldn't do that.

1152
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:28,956
- What do you mean we couldn't do that?

1153
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:30,178
Red'd love it, I'll go get him.

1154
00:48:30,178 --> 00:48:31,817
- Oh, wait a minute, now hold on here.

1155
00:48:31,817 --> 00:48:34,021
Couldn't you do somethin'
not quite so drastic?

1156
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:35,021
- Any ideas?

1157
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:39,675
- Yeah, I think I better
go back to Point Jervis.

1158
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:41,306
Uncle Charlie's a pretty
tough guy to deal with.

1159
00:48:41,306 --> 00:48:42,888
And from the way he talked tonight,

1160
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:45,288
you better find some place
else to rehearse your band.

1161
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:46,251
Well, so long Horace.

1162
00:48:46,251 --> 00:48:47,084
- Well, so long, Jimmy.

1163
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:47,917
- Sorry about this.

1164
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:48,801
And Willie, thanks for everything.

1165
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:49,979
- So long, Jimmy.
- It's been very nice.

1166
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:51,270
- Jim, wait a minute.
- What?

1167
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,427
- That's it. The band, he doesn't like it.

1168
00:48:53,427 --> 00:48:55,320
- No, he certainly does not.

1169
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,969
What?

1170
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,643
- [Horace] Come on.

1171
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:01,861

Jimmy.

1187
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:31,515
- Here he comes, do you
think it'll work, Horace?

1188
00:50:31,515 --> 00:50:32,665
- If these whiskers don't fall off.

1189
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:33,498
- Yeah.

1190
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:35,834
Yes, Uncle Charlie?

1191
00:50:35,834 --> 00:50:36,667
- Jimmy.

1192
00:50:37,524 --> 00:50:39,330
What are you doin' down here?

1193
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:40,163
And who is this man?

1194
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,139
- Well, I'll tell you, Uncle Charlie,

1195
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:42,737
I got worried about you, I couldn't sleep,

1196
00:50:42,737 --> 00:50:43,850
so I called in a specialist.

1197
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:47,207
Now, this is Professor Heidt,
this is my Uncle Charlie.

1198
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:49,453
- Oh nonsense, I don't need a doctor,

1199
00:50:49,453 --> 00:50:51,092
I eat my own health foods.

1200
00:50:51,092 --> 00:50:53,387
It's my nerves that are cracking.

1201
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:56,003
- That's why I'm here, Mr.
Haskell, to work on your nerves.

1202
00:50:56,003 --> 00:50:57,170
Relax, please.

1203
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:03,419
- Relax? How can anybody relax
with that music going on?

1204
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:04,715
- Music?

1205
00:51:04,715 --> 00:51:05,548
- Music?

1206
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:09,905
- [Both] What music?

1207
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:13,155
- That creepy music. Don't you hear it?

1208
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:17,525
- You see what I mean, Professor?

1209
00:51:17,525 --> 00:51:19,942
(doctor hums thoughtfully)

1210
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:22,559
- I tell you, I hear music.

1211
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,559
Maybe it's the radio in the library.

1212
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,529
It's not the radio.

1213
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:31,793
- Do you still hear it, Uncle Charlie?

1214
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:33,579
- Yes, it's still playing.

1215
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:36,722
- Mr. Haskell, tell me,
where does this music

1216
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:37,555
seem to be coming from?

1217
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:41,638
- I don't know, but just
a moment, I'll tell you.

1218
00:51:44,621 --> 00:51:47,434
It's here, it's plainer down here.

1219
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:49,623
Da do dee da dum, da do dee da dum.

1220
00:51:49,623 --> 00:51:51,676
- Uncle Charlie, don't you
think you better go back to bed?

1221
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:53,374
- I tell you, Jimmy, I hear it.

1222
00:51:53,374 --> 00:51:56,917
(grunting) Here.

1223
00:51:56,917 --> 00:51:59,080
Here, here it is.

1224
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,913
Da da da da.

1225
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:02,237
It, it's coming from the furnace.

1226
00:52:02,237 --> 00:52:03,811
- Music in furnace.

1227
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:06,378
- Well, listen yourself.

1228
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:09,711
Jimmy, please tell him that you hear it.

1229
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:14,873
I'll get Parks, he'll get me out of this.

1230
00:52:14,873 --> 00:52:16,821
Parks, he'll back me
up, you see if he don't.

1231
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:19,910
- What's the matter?
(horse-racing trumpet call)

1232
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,163
- There.

1233
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:22,735
Don't tell me you don't hear anything.

1234
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:23,723
- Oh, yes.

1235
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,846
- It's about time, I was
beginning to get nervous.

1236
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,064
- Beautiful string quartet.

1237
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:29,581
- String quartet? It's bugles.

1238
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:30,860
(trumpets blasting)

1239
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,083
- Hears bugles on phone.

1240
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,328
- I tell you, I hear bugles.

1241
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:34,242
- It's bugles.

1242
00:52:34,242 --> 00:52:35,471
- Don't try to humor me.

1243
00:52:35,471 --> 00:52:37,326
- All right, now let's
go and get some air.

1244
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:38,192
You've nothing to worry about

1245
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:40,228
until you start seeing things.

1246
00:52:40,228 --> 00:52:41,081
There you go.
- There's nothing wrong

1247
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:42,180
with me.

1248
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,763
(orchestral fanfare music)

1249
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,640
(Charlie gasping)

1250
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,385
Jimmy, look. Doctor,
look. What do you see?

1251
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:54,656
- [Jimmy] What do you
want us to see, Uncle?

1252
00:52:54,656 --> 00:52:56,812
- [Charlie] Girls, dancing on the lawn.

1253
00:52:56,812 --> 00:52:58,032
- Where?

1254
00:52:58,032 --> 00:52:59,009
- There.

1255
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,668
(wind whipping)

1256
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:03,309
(Charlie gasping)

1257
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:05,885
- Sees paper dolls dancing on lawn.

1258
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,366
- Paper dolls?

1259
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:10,446
You're right, Jimmy,
I'm in terrible shape.

1260
00:53:10,446 --> 00:53:12,366
My nerves are all gone.

1261
00:53:12,366 --> 00:53:14,895
Doctor, what do you think I better do?

1262
00:53:14,895 --> 00:53:18,082
- Mr. Haskell, give your
nerves a good, long rest.

1263
00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:20,045
Get outta town.

1264
00:53:20,045 --> 00:53:21,626
- I'll do it.

1265
00:53:21,626 --> 00:53:22,721
I'll go up in the woods.

1266
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:23,923
- Fine, we'll help you pack.

1267
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:28,734
- No. Not until I find the
man who threw that tomato.

1268
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:30,400
- Now, Uncle Charlie, your
health is much more important

1269
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,745
than that silly tomato.

1270
00:53:31,745 --> 00:53:32,580
- Yes, Mr. Haskell, that's right.

1271
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,112
- Sure, now let me handle this.

1272
00:53:34,112 --> 00:53:35,432
I'll put the finger on that fella,

1273
00:53:35,432 --> 00:53:38,167
he's as good as in jail right now. Almost.

1274
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,232
And while you're up there resting,

1275
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:41,494
he'll be well taken care
of, don't worry about that.

1276
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:43,559
And I'm the guy that can do it.

1277
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,155
- Good.

1278
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,185
I'll take the first
train out in the morning.

1279
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:49,121
Oh!

1280
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:50,740
- What's the matter now?

1281
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,970
- The music stopped.

1282
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,726
(bass string music)

1283
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:55,038
All but the bull fiddle.

1284
00:53:55,038 --> 00:53:56,692
- Now you see, you're improving already.

1285
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:57,525
(happy orchestral music)

1286
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,358
- Yes.

1287
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:03,952
(chipper violin music)

1288
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,753
(door clicks shut)

1289
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:08,541
- Hiya, Mr. Haskell,
what can I do for you?

1290
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:09,387
- Hello, Mr. Louderman.

1291
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:10,968
Well, I just dropped in
to see if we couldn't make

1292
00:54:10,968 --> 00:54:13,814
the "Haskell Happiness
Hour" a little bit happier.

1293
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:15,802
- Welcome, stranger, sit right down.

1294
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:16,901
What'll ya have to drink?

1295
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:17,734
- Well, I. .

1296
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:19,511
- Hello, Mr. Baccus.

1297
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:21,044
- What's the purpose of this meeting?

1298
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:23,055
- Well, we were about
to discuss the program.

1299
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,301
- You know very well that I have charge

1300
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:26,450
of the "Happiness Hour"
during Mr. Haskell's absence.

1301
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:27,683
He trusts me implicitly.

1302
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:28,969
- Well, not a hundred percent.

1303
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,042
- I beg your pardon?

1304
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,372
- Look, I have a note from my uncle

1305
00:54:31,372 --> 00:54:34,030
giving me complete charge
of the program, hm?

1306
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,851
- Well, it didn't take
you long to undermine me

1307
00:54:35,851 --> 00:54:36,684
with your uncle, did it?

1308
00:54:36,684 --> 00:54:37,517
- Hm-mm.

1309
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:39,165
- How do I know you didn't
write that yourself?

1310
00:54:39,165 --> 00:54:40,723
Now listen, Mr. Louderman,
they'll be no change. .

1311
00:54:40,723 --> 00:54:42,181
- Would you excuse us a minute?

1312
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:43,113
- Certainly.
- I wanna talk to you.

1313
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,770
- Yes. We had better talk this over.

1314
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,468
- Yeah, yeah, right.

1315
00:54:46,468 --> 00:54:47,635
Be right back.

1316
00:54:50,118 --> 00:54:51,997
(fist punches)
(Jasper cries out)

1317
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,256
(objects crashing)

1318
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,107
- I'd like to make some
other improvements, too.

1319
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:57,303
- Go right ahead.

1320
00:54:57,303 --> 00:54:58,631
- Well, I'd like to use a band.

1321
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:01,169
- Oh, no, no, please, no.
We're overloaded with bands.

1322
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:03,743
- No, but this is ideal,
because my uncle hates it.

1323
00:55:03,743 --> 00:55:04,720
- What?

1324
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,126
- Yeah, it drove him clear up to Canada.

1325
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:07,843
- Well, then what do you wanna
put it on his program, for?

1326
00:55:07,843 --> 00:55:09,258
- Well, it's pretty hard to explain,

1327
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:11,628
but you see it'll give the band a break.

1328
00:55:11,628 --> 00:55:13,269
And then they'll have
to thank my uncle for it

1329
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,081
and that'll make him feel pretty good.

1330
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:15,914
- Up in Canada?

1331
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:16,747
- Up in Canada
- Yeah, yeah.

1332
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,375
- And there's sort of a feud going on.

1333
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,355
- A feud?

1334
00:55:19,355 --> 00:55:21,351
- Uh-huh. And uh, then there's a girl.

1335
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,235
- Oh, a girl.

1336
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,068
- Yeah.

1337
00:55:24,485 --> 00:55:25,486
- Hm.

1338
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:27,469
- Sounds pretty confusing, doesn't it?

1339
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:29,517
- Well, no, it sounds pretty good.

1340
00:55:29,517 --> 00:55:30,525
- It does?

1341
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:32,168
Well, that's it, you play Thursday night

1342
00:55:32,168 --> 00:55:33,792
over a coast-to-coast
hookup at the opening

1343
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,146
of the Eastchester Country Club.

1344
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:36,668
- That's great, Jim,
how did you ever do it?

1345
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:37,645
- Well, I don't know.

1346
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:38,874
I just started to talk,
the fellow listened.

1347
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:41,009
I'm just as surprised about it as you are.

1348
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:42,213
- How much do we get for it?

1349
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:43,380
- Uh, nothing.

1350
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:45,088
- Nothing?

1351
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:45,936
- No, you don't get anything.

1352
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:47,262
- Oh.

1353
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,095
- Well, what of it?

1354
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,415
Is it any different than
playing for the neighbors

1355
00:55:49,415 --> 00:55:50,419
and Old Man Haskell?

1356
00:55:50,419 --> 00:55:51,413
What do we get out of that?

1357
00:55:51,413 --> 00:55:53,537
At least this way, there's a chance.

1358
00:55:53,537 --> 00:55:55,635
- [Band Member] I'm
sold, what can we lose?

1359
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:57,843
- That's all right for me.

1360
00:55:57,843 --> 00:56:00,426
(wind gusting)

1361
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:10,932
- [Charlie] Hey, gimme a push.

1362
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:12,751
- Bonsoir, monsieur.

1363
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:13,810
- What did he say?

1364
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,947
- Bonsoir, monsieur.

1365
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:18,330
- And you made me drag
this pack through the woods

1366
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:20,021
for four hours to get to a place

1367
00:56:20,021 --> 00:56:21,435
where nobody can talk English.

1368
00:56:21,435 --> 00:56:23,685
What kind of a guide are you, anyway?

1369
00:56:23,685 --> 00:56:28,193
Hey, Pierre, have-ay-voo
a machine, talkie-talkie?

1370
00:56:28,193 --> 00:56:29,942
- Uh, no, I don't think so.

1371
00:56:29,942 --> 00:56:31,839
I've got a good one right there.

1372
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,500
- I'm not a peddler, this one is busted.

1373
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,240
I want to hear a program in America

1374
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,733
that goes on at eight o'clock.

1375
00:56:37,733 --> 00:56:39,400
- Oh, help yourself.

1376
00:56:41,946 --> 00:56:44,547
- Here, get this avalanche off my back.

1377
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:45,687
- Oui, monsieur.

1378
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:47,881
(Charlie growls)

1379
00:56:47,881 --> 00:56:49,214
- Oui, monsieur.

1380
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:52,892
(swing music)

1381
00:57:08,078 --> 00:57:11,015
(audience applauding)

1382
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:12,312
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1383
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:13,348
That's all right now.

1384
00:57:13,348 --> 00:57:15,130
We're about to start our broadcast.

1385
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,260
(audience applauding)

1386
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,093
Well, boys, here we go. Good luck.

1387
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:22,798
- What, are you scared?

1388
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:24,470
Well, just take deep breath.

1389
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:27,803
(Molly breathes deeply)

1390
00:57:30,324 --> 00:57:31,946
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1391
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:33,755
The "Haskell Happiness
Hour" comes to you tonight

1392
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:34,784
from the dining patio

1393
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,064
of the exclusive Eastchester Country Club.

1394
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:39,056
- Country Club? What the. .

1395
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:40,607
- This marks the first
appearance on the air

1396
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,246
of a new band. .

1397
00:57:42,246 --> 00:57:43,116
- Music?
- Horace Heidt

1398
00:57:43,116 --> 00:57:45,270
and His Musical Knights.
- On my program?

1399
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,248
- Thank you and good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1400
00:57:47,248 --> 00:57:49,418
This is Horace Heidt, and the
first number on our program

1401
00:57:49,418 --> 00:57:53,487
is "Broadway Caballero,"
featuring Miss Molly McCorkle.

1402
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:55,126

1484
01:03:12,578 --> 01:03:13,936
- Well, it certainly took you long enough

1485
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:15,068
to get around to it.

1486
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:18,595
- Eh, no, this is just something
that's been worrying me.

1487
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:20,706
You don't know anything
about me, who I am.

1488
01:03:20,706 --> 01:03:23,358
- Oh, as if that made any
difference. You're you and I'm me.

1489
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:24,553
- Well, I think I'd better tell you

1490
01:03:24,553 --> 01:03:25,746
about this.
- Oh, there you are.

1491
01:03:25,746 --> 01:03:26,674
- Oh, go away.
- Looks like you made

1492
01:03:26,674 --> 01:03:27,507
quite an impression.

1493
01:03:27,507 --> 01:03:28,586
Well, it'll be a different story

1494
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:29,941
when I tell your uncle about it.

1495
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:33,858
Believe me, CJ won't pay
for your philandering.

1496
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:36,076
- Is Haskell your uncle?

1497
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:37,599
- Yes, now that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

1498
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,022
If you'll just let me explain.

1499
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:41,617
- I don't need any explanation,
it's all perfectly obvious.

1500
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,533
Sneaking into our home,
pretending that you wanted

1501
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:44,826
to help us and then
making me feel for you so.

1502
01:03:44,826 --> 01:03:46,601
- Now wait a minute, will
you please let me explain?

1503
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:48,410
- What a cheap trick, you are a Haskell.

1504
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:51,048
- Hey now, Molly, quiet,
they can hear you out here.

1505
01:03:51,048 --> 01:03:52,493
- Yeah, how 'bout that?
- That's fine!

(audience applauding)

1507
01:03:55,324 --> 01:03:58,421
Hello everybody. I have
some good news for you.

1508
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:01,274
Every week beginning next
Thursday, Mr. Haskell,

1509
01:04:01,274 --> 01:04:04,531
the sponsor of our program,
is going to give away $1,000

1510
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:06,364
in cash to somebody.

1511
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:09,821
- A thousand dollars a week! That's a lie!

1512
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:11,265
- Isn't that generous, folks?

1513
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:15,501
(audience applauding)
(audience chatter excitedly)

1514
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:18,932
Now, Mr. Haskell, trick
your way out of that.

1515
01:04:18,932 --> 01:04:21,369
(peppy big band music)

1516
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:22,291
- I've gotta get back home.

1517
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,059
How long is it gonna take
me to get outta here?

1518
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:26,051
- Well, first portage take two days.

1519
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:27,173
- How long it take it to get here?

1520
01:04:27,173 --> 01:04:28,153
- A week!

1521
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:29,495
- With luck, you can
make it back in a week.

1522
01:04:29,495 --> 01:04:30,984
- A week and, huh!

1523
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:32,484
Let's get started.

1524
01:04:34,314 --> 01:04:36,335
- Jimmy! Jimmy!

1525
01:04:36,335 --> 01:04:38,122
Jimmy, my boy, congratulations.

1526
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:39,595
That was a marvelous idea.

1527
01:04:39,595 --> 01:04:40,681
How did you come to think of it?

1528
01:04:40,681 --> 01:04:42,448
- Just came out of a clear sky.

1529
01:04:42,448 --> 01:04:44,698
(chuckles)

1530
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:50,572
- The "Haskell Happiness Hour"
created nationwide interest

1531
01:04:50,572 --> 01:04:53,322
in his program last night by
announcing that $1,000 a week

1532
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:54,896
would be given away in cash.

1533
01:04:54,896 --> 01:04:56,295
- I know, I read all the papers.

1534
01:04:56,295 --> 01:04:57,690
- [Parks] Here's Mr. Haskell.

1535
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:58,664
- [Jimmy] Morning.

1536
01:04:58,664 --> 01:05:00,160
- This is your uncle's
attorney, Mr. Chalmers.

1537
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,008
- Good morning.

1538
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:01,867
- How you do, sir?

1539
01:05:01,867 --> 01:05:02,700
- I won't take much of your time.

1540
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,094
Just sign this paper, please.

1541
01:05:04,094 --> 01:05:04,944
- What is it?

1542
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:06,729
- A statement that you did
not authorize Miss McCorkle

1543
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:08,664
to make that announcement last night.

1544
01:05:08,664 --> 01:05:09,512
That she did it out of spite

1545
01:05:09,512 --> 01:05:11,129
with intent to damage your uncle.

1546
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:12,409
Now sign here, please.

1547
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:14,051
- Oh, now, wait a minute.

1548
01:05:14,051 --> 01:05:15,381
- There's nothing to worry about.

1549
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:18,157
I'll guarantee we can get
judgment against the McCorkles.

1550
01:05:18,157 --> 01:05:20,995
They won't be able to pay,
so we take their property.

1551
01:05:20,995 --> 01:05:23,289
- And that's what your uncle's
been trying to do for years.

1552
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:24,881
- Now sign here, please.

1553
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:26,853
- It's a funny thing, I don't
like to get pushed around.

1554
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:29,258
I also don't sign anything
until I read it first.

1555
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,328
Now, how'd you like to get
out of here, both of you.

1556
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,022
- Don't you hit me
again, I have my glasses.

1557
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:34,691
(crashing) Oh, oh!

1558
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:35,802
- Mr. Haskell, your uncle. .

1559
01:05:35,802 --> 01:05:37,969
- Good day, sir, good day.

1560
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:44,801
Beautiful, Parks.

1561
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:46,801
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

1562
01:05:50,532 --> 01:05:51,365
(phone ringing)

1563
01:05:51,365 --> 01:05:53,732
- Why don't you answer the phone?

1564
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:55,242
Hello.

1565
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:58,177
Oh, Jimmy me boy, how are ye?

1566
01:05:58,177 --> 01:06:01,380
Oh, you want to talk to Molly?

1567
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,130
Well, I don't think it's
a very good time to.

1568
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:07,955
Just a moment.

1569
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:11,715
You go and fight your own
battles, I'm not doin' it for you.

1570
01:06:11,715 --> 01:06:14,048
- I don't wanna talk to him.

1571
01:06:15,578 --> 01:06:16,807
Well?

1572
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,170
- Look, I hate to annoy
you, but this is important.

1573
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:21,182
Now that $1,000 offer you made last night,

1574
01:06:21,182 --> 01:06:23,632
it was my idea, do you understand?

1575
01:06:23,632 --> 01:06:25,559
Now, just don't argue.

1576
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:27,023
Anybody asks you anything about it,

1577
01:06:27,023 --> 01:06:29,726
just follow Grady's advice.

1578
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:31,350
- Don't you tell me to keep my mouth shut.

1579
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,487
Why should I?

1580
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:34,875
- Well, if you don't, they'll
take your home away from you.

1581
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,211
- What is this another one of your tricks?

1582
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:38,506
I don't need any help from you. What?

1583
01:06:38,506 --> 01:06:39,733
- I said don't be stupid.

1584
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:43,176
I'm not doin' it for you,
this is for mom and the boys.

1585
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:44,091
(phone receiver slams)

1586
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:45,409
- Oh!

1587
01:06:45,409 --> 01:06:47,083
- Excuse me, sir, Mr.
Louderman and Mr. Sampson

1588
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:47,916
are calling.

1589
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:48,849
- [Jimmy] Oh, have them come in.

1590
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:50,223
- Yes, sir.

1591
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:51,190
Come in, please.

1592
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,164
- Hello.

1593
01:06:52,164 --> 01:06:53,805
- Hello, Jimmy. Congratulations.

1594
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:55,591
Your program was a knockout.

1595
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:57,833
Telegrams, phone calls
from all over the country.

1596
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:00,306
People, oh, I beg your
pardon, this is Mr. Sampson.

1597
01:07:00,306 --> 01:07:01,139
- How do you do, Mr. Sampson.

1598
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:01,972
- Yes, sir.

1599
01:07:01,972 --> 01:07:02,805
- Won't you sit down?

1600
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:03,638
- Yes, thank you.

1601
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:04,615
- Mr. Sampson is an investigator

1602
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:05,852
for the federal government.

1603
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:07,190
- Oh, I see, the,

1604
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,295
well, what's the government
got to do with it?

1605
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:10,860
- We're only concerned with one detail,

1606
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,774
the method by which you
will give away the money.

1607
01:07:12,774 --> 01:07:15,346
- Oh, I see. Well, that
oughtn't to be very hard.

1608
01:07:15,346 --> 01:07:16,837
I never heard of anybody
having any trouble

1609
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:18,183
giving away a thousand dollars.

1610
01:07:18,183 --> 01:07:19,449
Well, let's see. .

1611
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,561
- You understand that
it cannon be a lottery.

1612
01:07:21,561 --> 01:07:23,079
The government wouldn't
permit raffles or drawings

1613
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:24,421
of any description.

1614
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:26,309
- Oh, oh, yes, I understand that.

1615
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:27,976
No, that would be. .

1616
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:32,201
Well, how 'bout a quiz contest?

1617
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:33,579
- Well, no, I'm afraid not.

1618
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:35,225
It was announced that the
money would be given away

1619
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:38,183
over the air, not to a studio audience.

1620
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:42,277
- Oh, well that sort of
complicates it, doesn't it?

1621
01:07:42,277 --> 01:07:44,095
Let's see, well, uh.

1622
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:45,567
Well, how 'bout taking a city directory

1623
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:47,662
and sticking a pin in it and
then give the thousand dollars

1624
01:07:47,662 --> 01:07:49,021
to the fella that gets stuck?

1625
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:51,308
- Oh, no, a city directory is local.

1626
01:07:51,308 --> 01:07:53,228
This has become a national affair.

1627
01:07:53,228 --> 01:07:54,937
- Oh, well, let's call the whole thing off

1628
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,974
and not give away my uncle's money at all.

1629
01:07:56,974 --> 01:07:59,507
- No, no, that money was
promised and must be given away.

1630
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:02,486
- Yes, if it isn't, why my
company loses its franchise.

1631
01:08:02,486 --> 01:08:04,380
And your uncle's business is ruined.

1632
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,488
- And you'll be liable to
a fine and imprisonment.

1633
01:08:07,488 --> 01:08:09,639
- Well, that's great.

1634
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:12,846
Now, I have quite a choice, don't I?

1635
01:08:12,846 --> 01:08:14,300
Either I give the money
away and go to jail

1636
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:18,133
or I don't give the money
away and go to jail.

1637
01:08:19,882 --> 01:08:21,465
- Hand me the salt.

1638
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,819
Still moonin' about Jimmy, huh?

1639
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,849
Well, believe me, you've
seen the last of him.

1640
01:08:28,849 --> 01:08:30,374
And he's probably glad he found out

1641
01:08:30,374 --> 01:08:32,536
just what kind of a girl you really are.

1642
01:08:32,536 --> 01:08:33,739
- All right, Mom, all right.

1643
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,396
- But it's not all right.

1644
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:38,588
A fine lad like Jimmy deserves
a girl who really loves him.

1645
01:08:38,588 --> 01:08:43,255
Whether his name be Hamilton
or Haskell or Hasenpfeffer.

1646
01:08:44,566 --> 01:08:45,857
- Well, I hope you're satisfied.

1647
01:08:45,857 --> 01:08:47,777
- What's the matter now?

1648
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:48,981
- Well, nobody can figure
out how to give away

1649
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:51,081
that thousand dollars.

1650
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:52,887
It looks like Jimmy's going
to jail on account of it.

1651
01:08:52,887 --> 01:08:54,452
- Oh, this is awful.

1652
01:08:54,452 --> 01:08:55,655
- But Jimmy isn't responsible.

1653
01:08:55,655 --> 01:08:57,462
He didn't make the offer, I did.

1654
01:08:57,462 --> 01:08:58,405
- Well, he says it's his program

1655
01:08:58,405 --> 01:09:00,295
and he's gonna take the rap for it.

1656
01:09:00,295 --> 01:09:01,472
- Well, are you going to stand by

1657
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:02,811
and see that boy go to jail?

1658
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:03,788
- But Jimmy told me. .

1659
01:09:03,788 --> 01:09:05,967
- I know what he told you and why.

1660
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:07,997
To keep a roof over our heads.

1661
01:09:07,997 --> 01:09:12,997
Well, I'd rather we'd lose
our house than lose our pride.

1662
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:15,477
- Oh, mom. (sniffles)

1663
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:18,810
I've been feeling the same way all week.

1664
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:22,532
(phone ringing)

1665
01:09:22,532 --> 01:09:24,005
- [Parks] Yes?

1666
01:09:24,005 --> 01:09:25,005
No, not yet.

1667
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,675
- Well, gentlemen, someone's
got to think of something,

1668
01:09:28,675 --> 01:09:30,242
somehow, and soon.

1669
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:32,582
It's tonight, you know, the
program goes on the air.

1670
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:34,414
Not next month.

1671
01:09:34,414 --> 01:09:37,733
And we're no closer to the
answer than we were a week ago.

1672
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:38,843
(phone rings)

1673
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:39,931
- Yes?

1674
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:40,861
- I've got it.

1675
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:43,192
I got it this time, boy, it
came to me just like that.

1676
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:44,031
- What is it?
- Now look.

1677
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:44,887
We'll get that bowl.

1678
01:09:44,887 --> 01:09:46,415
You know that great big
glass bowl they used

1679
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,311
for the draft numbers?

1680
01:09:47,311 --> 01:09:48,606
- Great, that's it.
- Yeah.

1681
01:09:48,606 --> 01:09:49,993
- My boy, I'm proud of you.

1682
01:09:49,993 --> 01:09:50,968
- That'll do it.

1683
01:09:50,968 --> 01:09:51,803
- No, no, gentlemen, no, no.

1684
01:09:51,803 --> 01:09:52,653
- What's a matter?

1685
01:09:52,653 --> 01:09:53,507
- It would be a lottery,

1686
01:09:53,507 --> 01:09:54,340
and the government forbids lotteries.

1687
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,782
- No, no, not yet.
(Jimmy groans)

1688
01:09:56,782 --> 01:09:57,869
- Okay, I'll go back to see

1689
01:09:57,869 --> 01:09:59,246
if I can't dream up something else.

1690
01:09:59,246 --> 01:10:00,499
- You're not sleeping up there, are you?

1691
01:10:00,499 --> 01:10:02,019
- Sleeping, I haven't slept for days.

1692
01:10:02,019 --> 01:10:04,462
I'm eating aspirin tablets like peanuts.

1693
01:10:04,462 --> 01:10:05,599
- Gentlemen, I've got it.

1694
01:10:05,599 --> 01:10:06,432
- [All] What?

1695
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:08,387
- The first time ever I've
been able to beat this game.

1696
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:10,359
(all grumbling)
(phone ringing)

1697
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:11,306
- Yes?
- Look.

1698
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:12,442
- No.
- Why don't you all go down

1699
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:13,547
to the broadcasting station.

1700
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:15,309
Maybe if I was alone, I
could think of something.

1701
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:16,570
- Okay, Jimmy, we'll get out.

1702
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,496
Sampson, come on.

1703
01:10:17,496 --> 01:10:18,469
(phone rings)

1704
01:10:18,469 --> 01:10:19,302
- Yes?

1705
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:20,713
No, not yet.
- Listen.

1706
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:22,917
Would ya put that thing off
the hook and leave it off?

1707
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:23,936
- Thank you, sir.

1708
01:10:23,936 --> 01:10:24,769
- Yeah.

1709
01:10:27,485 --> 01:10:28,328
- Are ya all right, Jimmy?

1710
01:10:28,328 --> 01:10:31,064
- Oh, yes, yeah, I'm just
beginning to get my second wind.

1711
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,174
- Well, you better think of something.

1712
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,424
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

1713
01:10:43,927 --> 01:10:45,130
- It's 7:30, you heard from Jimmy, yet?

1714
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,383
- No, nobody answers the phone.

1715
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:48,387
- How are we go to on the air?

1716
01:10:48,387 --> 01:10:49,860
- Brother, when the chimes
indicate eight o'clock,

1717
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,476
you're on the air.

1718
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:53,309
- From coast to coast.

1719
01:10:55,124 --> 01:11:00,124
(banging at door)
(doorbell buzzes)

1720
01:11:05,117 --> 01:11:07,863
- Oh. Coming, Mr. Haskell, coming.

1721
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,696
(banging at door)

1722
01:11:12,418 --> 01:11:13,589
- Well, it's about time.

1723
01:11:13,589 --> 01:11:14,675
Why didn't you answer the telephone?

1724
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:15,550
- Well, madam, you see. .

1725
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,586
- I want to talk to the,

1726
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:18,624
well, how do you like that?

1727
01:11:18,624 --> 01:11:21,060
(pocketbook thuds)
- Oh!

1728
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,330
- (clapping) Come on, wake up.

1729
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:23,661
Come on, get up, get up, will you?

1730
01:11:23,661 --> 01:11:25,722
- I can't do it, I can't do
it, it's against the law.

1731
01:11:25,722 --> 01:11:29,169
- Come on, it's Molly. Oh, get up.

1732
01:11:29,169 --> 01:11:31,129
- Oh, yeah. It's you.

1733
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:33,417
- Yes, it's me, now come on.

1734
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:34,966
- I suppose you wanna know
how I'm gonna give away

1735
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:36,077
that thousand dollars.

1736
01:11:36,077 --> 01:11:37,459
Well, I haven't the slightest idea.

1737
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,292
Now go home, go home.

1738
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,062
- "Go home," he says.

1739
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:43,492
You come down outta
there as fast as you can.

1740
01:11:43,492 --> 01:11:45,235
On your feet, big boy.

1741
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:47,241
If you think the McCorkles
are gonna let any Haskell

1742
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:49,300
fight their battles for
them, you're cuckoo.

1743
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,873
- Now, if you think the
Haskells are gonna let

1744
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,701
the McCorkles kick them
around, you're cuckoo too.

1745
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:55,133
No go on, go away, go away.

1746
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:57,642
- Still gonna sleep, huh?

1747
01:11:57,642 --> 01:11:59,159
- Uh oh, now just a second.

1748
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:00,663
Don't you dare.

1749
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:02,764
- Madam, you can't do that.

1750
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:03,597
- Where's the telephone?

1751
01:12:03,597 --> 01:12:06,514
(Parks sputtering)

1752
01:12:08,434 --> 01:12:09,417
- Now what do you think you're doin'?

1753
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:10,379
- I'm going to tell the government man

1754
01:12:10,379 --> 01:12:11,238
exactly what happened.

1755
01:12:11,238 --> 01:12:12,841
- Oh, no you're not.
- Oh, yes I am.

1756
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:13,814
- Here, gimme that!

1757
01:12:13,814 --> 01:12:14,969
- Come on, Jimmy, I've made up my mind.

1758
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:15,998
- Let me have that phone.
Give me that phone.

1759
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,901
- Now, let go of that phone. No, I won't.

1760
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:19,528
All right!

1761
01:12:19,528 --> 01:12:24,006
(clock chimes erratically)
Millions of other telephones.

1762
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,041
- That's it!

1763
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,014
- [Molly] That's what?

1764
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:27,824
- Hands spinning around,
millions of telephones,

1765
01:12:27,824 --> 01:12:29,348
millions of telephone books.

1766
01:12:29,348 --> 01:12:30,286
Parks!

1767
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:31,511
And it's not a lottery.

1768
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:33,037
- You are cuckoo.
- Get my coat.

1769
01:12:33,037 --> 01:12:34,015
Goodbye.

1770
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:34,906
(Molly yells)

1771
01:12:34,906 --> 01:12:35,739
- Oh!

1772
01:12:37,868 --> 01:12:41,285
(vibrant big band music)

1773
01:12:44,405 --> 01:12:46,620
- The "Haskell Happiness Hour"
presents the radio sensation

1774
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,680
of the nation, the Pot o' Gold,

1775
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,862
featuring Horace Heidt
and his Musical Knights.

1776
01:12:49,862 --> 01:12:53,514
(triumphant orchestral music)

1777
01:12:53,514 --> 01:12:55,121
- And don't forget, ladies and gentlemen,

1778
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,563
before this program is over,

1779
01:12:56,563 --> 01:13:00,113
we will give away $1,000 in cash.

1780
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:01,947
The method of giving it
will be announced later.

1781
01:13:01,947 --> 01:13:04,942
(triumphant orchestral music)

1782
01:13:04,942 --> 01:13:06,156
♪ Here we come ♪

1783
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:07,745

1784
01:13:07,745 --> 01:13:10,212

(audience applauding)

1787
01:13:17,549 --> 01:13:18,587
- [Jasper] Here I am, CJ.

1788
01:13:18,587 --> 01:13:20,490
- Jasper, did you stop the program?

1789
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,820
- I couldn't, it's on the air now.

1790
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:25,017
- I'll stop it if I have
to tear down the studio.

1791
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:27,828
- Why did I ever go in the
radio business to begin with?

1792
01:13:27,828 --> 01:13:30,074
Jimmy, where have you
been? Have you got an idea?

1793
01:13:30,074 --> 01:13:31,018
- Yeah, this is it, take 'em.

1794
01:13:31,018 --> 01:13:32,039
- Uh, what are they?

1795
01:13:32,039 --> 01:13:33,134
- Telephone books from
all over the country.

1796
01:13:33,134 --> 01:13:35,185
Give 'em here, Parks. Oh dear.

1797
01:13:35,185 --> 01:13:36,591
- Now you go and get the rest of 'em.

1798
01:13:36,591 --> 01:13:37,954
- Yes sir.

1799
01:13:37,954 --> 01:13:40,902
(relaxed orchestral music)

1800
01:13:40,902 --> 01:13:41,938
- Gangway.

1801
01:13:41,938 --> 01:13:45,521
(relaxed orchestral music)

1802
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,654
Now, listen.

1803
01:13:49,654 --> 01:13:50,774
We're gonna give the
money away by telephone,

1804
01:13:50,774 --> 01:13:51,607
you understand?

1805
01:13:51,607 --> 01:13:53,610
- You cut the books into
sections of 500 pages each.

1806
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,749
- Put numbers on each one of 'em.

1807
01:13:54,749 --> 01:13:56,342
- Okay.

1808
01:13:56,342 --> 01:13:57,175
Give us a hand here, boys.

1809
01:13:57,175 --> 01:14:01,515
(men chattering excitedly)

1810
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:03,515
- After you.
- Thank you.

1811
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,473
- Oh, that's nice goin'

1812
01:14:08,473 --> 01:14:11,084
Come on, Parks, we have to go.

1813
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:14,001
- Ha ha ha. Same to you, fine work.

1814
01:14:17,473 --> 01:14:19,036
- Ladies and gentlemen of
the listening audience,

1815
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:21,927
here's the news you've been waiting for.

1816
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:23,629
The thousand dollars we
promised you will be given away

1817
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:25,536
by telephone, so stand by.

1818
01:14:25,536 --> 01:14:27,327
- Hey, that's my money you're giving away,

1819
01:14:27,327 --> 01:14:29,164
and I won't stand for it.

1820
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,182
I'll cancel my contract at Alderman.

1821
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:32,653
I'll telephone ya!

1822
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:34,174
Get me to a telephone.

1823
01:14:34,174 --> 01:14:35,344
(carnival barkers shouting)
(carnival music)

1824
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:36,177
- All right, there's a wheel.

1825
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:37,534
Now how are we gonna borrow it?

1826
01:14:37,534 --> 01:14:38,856
- [Barker] A prize in
every spin of the wheel.

1827
01:14:38,856 --> 01:14:41,597
Come on, boys, take home
the bacon, no play. .

1828
01:14:41,597 --> 01:14:43,221
- (snaps) You two go around the back.

1829
01:14:43,221 --> 01:14:44,744
When I yell snookie, you borrow it.

1830
01:14:44,744 --> 01:14:45,676
- Snookie, what's with the snookie?

1831
01:14:45,676 --> 01:14:46,676
- Get going.

1832
01:14:47,578 --> 01:14:49,651
- All right, no time to (indistinct)

1833
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,583
It's ten cents a game.

1834
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:53,436
Who wouldn't give a
dime for a sensational. .

1835
01:14:53,436 --> 01:14:56,351
- Snookie! Oh, where have
you been, my sugarplum?

1836
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:57,332
- Madam. .

1837
01:14:57,332 --> 01:14:58,831
- Why did you leave me
in Battle Creek, Michigan

1838
01:14:58,831 --> 01:14:59,664
the way you did?

1839
01:14:59,664 --> 01:15:00,497
- Madam.

1840
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:01,421
- Oh, snook.
(harmonica trills)

1841
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:02,394
- Madam, I. .

1842
01:15:02,394 --> 01:15:03,900
- Why, you're not my snookie at all.

1843
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,517
(light laughter)

1844
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:07,308
- Huh, a character.

1845
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:08,141
How do you like that?

1846
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:09,083
Where are we going?

1847
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:10,614
I've been robbed.

1848
01:15:10,614 --> 01:15:12,416
Police! Get a policeman. Uh, later.

1849
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,225
Police, I've been robbed.

1850
01:15:14,225 --> 01:15:15,335
- [Jimmy] Gangway!

1851
01:15:15,335 --> 01:15:18,085
(carnival music)

1852
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,350
(big band music)

1853
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:30,249
- Hello, my little man,
may I use your telephone?

1854
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:34,587
- Hey Ma, Daniel Boone wants
to borrow our telephone.

1855
01:15:34,587 --> 01:15:35,739
- Go away, you tramp.

1856
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,128
No one uses this phone 'til they give away

1857
01:15:37,128 --> 01:15:38,743
that thousand dollars.

1858
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:39,873
(door slams)

1859
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,706
- Tramp? Daniel Boone?

1860
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,142
- Look out.

1861
01:15:45,142 --> 01:15:46,591
Look out.

1862
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:49,341
(big band music)

1863
01:15:54,548 --> 01:15:55,769
- Hey fellas, help out over here.

1864
01:15:55,769 --> 01:15:57,186
- All right, sir.

1865
01:15:59,062 --> 01:16:00,937
- Put it over there,
put it right over there.

1866
01:16:00,937 --> 01:16:01,770
- [Horace] Quiet, we're on the air.

1867
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:02,758
- [Jimmy] Yeah, I know.

1868
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:05,508
(big band music)

1869
01:16:06,822 --> 01:16:07,655
- Hold on there.

1870
01:16:07,655 --> 01:16:08,546
Say, you can't go in there.

1871
01:16:08,546 --> 01:16:10,360
This ain't no hillbilly program.

1872
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,837
- Back off. .
- Quiet, stop this!

1873
01:16:11,837 --> 01:16:12,947
- I ain't no hillbilly.

1874
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:13,991
I'm CJ Haskell.
- CJ!

1875
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,092
When did you get in town?

1876
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:16,288
- Louderman!
- Sh, sh.

1877
01:16:16,288 --> 01:16:17,687
- I wanna talk to you.

1878
01:16:17,687 --> 01:16:19,202
- Come on, come on. Come on.

1879
01:16:19,202 --> 01:16:22,001
- All right, Horace, go on.

1880
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:23,672
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the wheel's all ready,

1881
01:16:23,672 --> 01:16:25,021
all ready for the first spin,

1882
01:16:25,021 --> 01:16:26,600
the spin to determine the volume number.

1883
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,678
Larry Cotton, take it away.

1884
01:16:27,678 --> 01:16:29,125
- And there she goes,
ladies and gentlemen,

1885
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:31,575
this time after that
first big volume number.

1886
01:16:31,575 --> 01:16:33,898
Yes sir, and we want that
volume to have your name in it,

1887
01:16:33,898 --> 01:16:35,028
ladies and gentlemen.

1888
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:37,557
- And furthermore, I'm not
going to give away one penny!

1889
01:16:37,557 --> 01:16:40,492
- Okay, well I've got three
men in the sponsor's room

1890
01:16:40,492 --> 01:16:43,102
right now, who are begging
to buy this program.

1891
01:16:43,102 --> 01:16:44,791
- Buy it, they must be crazy.

1892
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,096
- Oh, is that so?

1893
01:16:46,096 --> 01:16:48,697
Well, they represent the
biggest advertising agencies

1894
01:16:48,697 --> 01:16:50,189
in this country.

1895
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,106
- Ah. What?

1896
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:53,101
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1897
01:16:53,101 --> 01:16:55,162
- We want you to be the one
that Horace is going to call

1898
01:16:55,162 --> 01:16:56,121
a little bit later.

1899
01:16:56,121 --> 01:16:57,628
She's going down to
get this volume number.

1900
01:16:57,628 --> 01:17:00,531
Coming back just a little bit
further and on and on and on,

1901
01:17:00,531 --> 01:17:02,333
and it's 124.

1902
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:03,750
- 124.
- 124, 124.

1903
01:17:05,582 --> 01:17:07,153
124.

1904
01:17:07,153 --> 01:17:09,351
Here, I've got it.

1905
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:11,348
(celebratory band music)

1906
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:12,511
- Now, we're all ready
for the second spin,

1907
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:14,004
the spin to determine the page number.

1908
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:15,630
Larry, let 'er go!

1909
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:16,784
- And there we go, ladies and gentlemen,

1910
01:17:16,784 --> 01:17:18,256
on that second big spin

1911
01:17:18,256 --> 01:17:19,808
the one to find the page
in that volume we chose

1912
01:17:19,808 --> 01:17:20,888
just a moment ago.

1913
01:17:20,888 --> 01:17:23,115
The one page that will have that $1,000

1914
01:17:23,115 --> 01:17:24,345
pot o' golden name on it.

1915
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:25,459
- Gentlemen, this is Mr. Haskell.

1916
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:26,503
- [Charlie] How do you do, gentlemen?

1917
01:17:26,503 --> 01:17:28,773
- The surest fire advertising
stunt I've ever seen.

1918
01:17:28,773 --> 01:17:30,182
- Do you want to sell it?

1919
01:17:30,182 --> 01:17:31,015
- Is it good?

1920
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:32,335
- I'll give you 20,000 for it, right now.

1921
01:17:32,335 --> 01:17:33,168
- Is it that good?

1922
01:17:33,168 --> 01:17:34,825
- I'll make it 30.

1923
01:17:34,825 --> 01:17:36,399
- Trying to steal it, huh?

1924
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:37,478
- And she's going down already,

1925
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:38,550
just to find this right page.

1926
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:42,040
And there she's stopping.
And it's page 66.

1927
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:42,873
- Page 66.

1928
01:17:44,015 --> 01:17:44,848
- 66.

1929
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:49,032
- I got it!

1930
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:50,956
(celebratory band music)

1931
01:17:50,956 --> 01:17:52,026
- And now, the third and last spin

1932
01:17:52,026 --> 01:17:53,658
to determine the name of
the person on that page

1933
01:17:53,658 --> 01:17:56,572
who will receive the actual
golden telephone call.

1934
01:17:56,572 --> 01:17:57,733
Larry, take it away.

1935
01:17:57,733 --> 01:17:58,780
- Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

1936
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,538
This time, through all of
the names on our chosen page

1937
01:18:00,538 --> 01:18:02,607
in our chosen volume, to
find just the one right name

1938
01:18:02,607 --> 01:18:05,191
that we can send this
$1,000 pot o' gold to.

1939
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:06,719
She's down at the bottom and
coming back a little bit,

1940
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,142
slowing down more and
more and more and more.

1941
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:11,907
And there it is, our listing is 38.

1942
01:18:11,907 --> 01:18:13,574
- Listing number 38.

1943
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:18,114
- 10.

1944
01:18:18,114 --> 01:18:18,947
15, 20.

1945
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:21,570
25, 30.

1946
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,071
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1947
01:18:24,071 --> 01:18:25,045
It's, it's. .

1948
01:18:25,045 --> 01:18:25,878
- Yeah, what?

1949
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:27,378
- It's. .
- Oh, the name is

1950
01:18:27,378 --> 01:18:30,211
Mr. Olaf Svensen, 3RJ, ring seven.

1951
01:18:31,682 --> 01:18:33,920
Ring seven? Uh, uh. .

1952
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,918
- Plunkett. Plunkett, Minnesota.

1953
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:37,937
- Plunkett, Plunkett, Minnesota.

1954
01:18:37,937 --> 01:18:40,009

01:18:40,009 --> 01:18:43,814

01:18:43,814 --> 01:18:45,064
- That's right.

1957
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:49,972
(triumphant fanfare music)

1958
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,850
(clock ticking)

1959
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:58,326
(phone ringing)

1960
01:18:58,326 --> 01:19:01,968
- Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'
Keep your jacket on.

1961
01:19:01,968 --> 01:19:02,877
Yeah, hello?

1962
01:19:02,877 --> 01:19:04,199
- Stop the clock, boys, stop the clock.

1963
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,554
(excited chatter)
Hello?

1964
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,776
Hello, is this Mr. Olaf Svensen speaking?

1965
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,859
- Ya, ya that's me, Olaf.

1966
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:12,396
A pot of what?

A thou, you give,

1968
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:20,269
say ain't got no time for monkey business.

1969
01:19:20,269 --> 01:19:21,102
What?

1970
01:19:22,204 --> 01:19:24,704
You give me a thousand dollar?

1971
01:19:26,893 --> 01:19:27,726
Helga!

1972
01:19:28,622 --> 01:19:31,039
(Olaf thuds)

1973
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:35,480
- Look, why you make my Ollie faint?

1974
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,897
What?

1975
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:37,730
A, a thou

1977
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:42,504
(Helga thuds)

1978
01:19:42,504 --> 01:19:43,672
- Hello?

1979
01:19:43,672 --> 01:19:44,755
Hello? Hello?

1980
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,602
Folks, they're speechless.

1981
01:19:47,602 --> 01:19:49,260
(band laughs)

1982
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,532
- It's a million dollar idea
and it's all mine, all. .

1983
01:19:52,532 --> 01:19:54,978
- Oh, so they brought
you back alive, did they?

1984
01:19:54,978 --> 01:19:56,022
- What are you doing here?

1985
01:19:56,022 --> 01:19:57,804
- I'm enjoying our program.

1986
01:19:57,804 --> 01:20:00,735
- Your program, what are you
trying to put over on me now?

1987
01:20:00,735 --> 01:20:02,719
It belongs to me, you understand?

1988
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:03,703
- It does, does it?

1989
01:20:03,703 --> 01:20:05,675
Why the whole thing was Molly's idea.

1990
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:06,508
- Molly's idea?
- And don't you try

1991
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:07,351
to tell me anything. .

1992
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:08,203
- Who is Molly?

1993
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,481
I wanna tell you.
- CJ, CJ!

1994
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:10,314
- Huh?

1995
01:20:10,314 --> 01:20:11,147
- It's all right.

1996
01:20:11,147 --> 01:20:12,074
We got you outta the whole mess.

1997
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:14,381
- You're not liable for anything
connected with the program.

1998
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:16,138
We fixed it so Miss
McCorkle is responsible

1999
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:17,208
for the whole thing.

2000
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:18,523
(laughs hysterically)

2001
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:20,096
- You nitwits!

2002
01:20:20,096 --> 01:20:21,848
You numskulls! Get outta here.

2003
01:20:21,848 --> 01:20:22,869
(men mumbling protests)

2004
01:20:22,869 --> 01:20:24,138
Leave from here, I say!

2005
01:20:24,138 --> 01:20:25,283
- CJ!
(objects crashing)

2006
01:20:25,283 --> 01:20:26,116
- Get outta here!

2007
01:20:26,116 --> 01:20:28,516
- That's swingin' them, Charlie. (laughs)

2008
01:20:28,516 --> 01:20:29,746
- Charlie!

2009
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:33,350
(both laugh heartedly)

2010
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,983
- And Molly is responsible
for the whole thing.

2011
01:20:35,983 --> 01:20:37,077
- Yeah.

2012
01:20:37,077 --> 01:20:38,113
- Hey, where you goin'?

2013
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:38,946
- [Molly] Out.

2014
01:20:38,946 --> 01:20:40,206
- Oh.

2015
01:20:40,206 --> 01:20:42,789
Um, Horace got the call
through on the telephone.

2016
01:20:42,789 --> 01:20:45,505
So, I guess everything's fine.

2017
01:20:45,505 --> 01:20:48,224
- Yes, everything's fine.

2018
01:20:48,224 --> 01:20:49,057
- Yeah.

2019
01:20:50,032 --> 01:20:52,794
Well, I guess it's just
one of those things, huh?

2020
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:55,328
The McCorkles are allergic
to the Haskells, huh?

2021
01:20:55,328 --> 01:20:56,450
- [Molly] Vice versa.

2022
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:59,016
- Yeah, vice versa, yeah.

2023
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:01,019
Well, goodbye, Molly.

2024
01:21:01,019 --> 01:21:01,852
- Bye.

2025
01:21:03,981 --> 01:21:04,814
- Well, Jimmy.

2026
01:21:04,814 --> 01:21:05,647
- Uncle Charlie.

2027
01:21:05,647 --> 01:21:07,046
- Aw, you come with me.

2028
01:21:07,046 --> 01:21:08,265
- Come on, you were in on this too.

2029
01:21:08,265 --> 01:21:09,352
- Mom!

2030
01:21:09,352 --> 01:21:12,844
(tender big band music)

2031
01:21:12,844 --> 01:21:14,771
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to introduce

2032
01:21:14,771 --> 01:21:17,044
the two young people who
originated this program,

2033
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:19,685
and which will be a permanent feature

2034
01:21:19,685 --> 01:21:21,703
of the "Haskell Happiness Hour. "

2035
01:21:21,703 --> 01:21:25,244
Miss Molly McCorkle and my
nephew, Mr. James Haskell.

2036
01:21:25,244 --> 01:21:29,105
(audience applauding)
- Yay!

2037
01:21:29,105 --> 01:21:31,853
- Say something, tell
'em how happy you are.

2038
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,012
- Hello, everybody.

2039
01:21:33,012 --> 01:21:34,729
I just want to tell you how happy I am

2040
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:36,992
that everything turned
out so well for everybody.

2041
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,205
(Molly sobbing)

2042
01:21:38,205 --> 01:21:40,169
- Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
the reason she's so happy

2043
01:21:40,169 --> 01:21:42,146
is that we're gonna be
married any second now.

2044
01:21:42,146 --> 01:21:43,526
(audience laughing)

2045
01:21:43,526 --> 01:21:46,319
All right, Miss McCorkle,
trick your way outta that one.

2046
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,972
(band members vocalizing)

2047
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:52,099
