4
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,166
You made good time, Yak.

5
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,200
How long you wait?

6
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, I got here last night.

7
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,633
What'd you find out?

8
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:41,100
Two men gonna hold up
stage, Coyote Canyon.

9
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,133
Much money on stage.

10
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,933
Well, it looks like we're
gonna have our hands full.

11
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,333
More trouble, more fun.

12
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,733
Ha, well that's one
way to look at it.

13
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,300
But there's been two sheriffs
killed in Little Rock,

14
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
and it's our job to
find out who did it.

15
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,766
We do 'em.

16
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,800
Well, I reckon we'd better
get started. [inaudible].

17
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,666
Gentlemen, I've
called this meeting,

18
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,433
that you may all know Al Davis.

19
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,233
He's to be sworn
in this afternoon

20
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,300
as sheriff of this county.

21
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,066
[applause]

22
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,733
Mr. Davis, I feel that we should
acquaint you with the fact

23
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,900
that this vicinity
is being terrorized

24
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,333
by a band of outlaws, ruled by
a man whom they call the shadow.

25
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,166
He's a very clever man.

26
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,200
Many traps have
been set for him,

27
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,900
and he's always evaded them.

28
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,733
Our cattle are stolen,
night after night.

29
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:16,033
Has absolutely no
regard for human life.

30
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:19,600
Stage coaches are held up
and robbed, the drivers shot.

31
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,100
Well, looks like we're gonna
get through this time, Dave.

32
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,700
You stay out of
sight and follow me.

33
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,600
Don't look back.

34
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,633
Drop that gun and keep driving.

35
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,800
You meet me in town.

36
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,500
HENCHMAN: Throw down that bag.

37
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,633
STAGECOACH DRIVER:
You're too late,

38
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,133
a lone rider beat you to it.

39
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:22,966
HENCHMAN: Yeah?

40
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,633
[gunshots]

41
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,233
(SCREAMING)

42
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,933
Heya, look, boys,
something's wrong.

43
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Hey, what's happened?

44
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,066
What's the matter?

45
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,066
You'd better get him to
a doctor, boys, quick.

46
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,100
Where can I find Mr. Matlock?

47
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,900
He's my uncle.

48
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,066
I'll get him for you, miss.

49
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,033
Thank you.

50
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,833
Well, miss, you had
quite an exciting ride.

51
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,433
I certainly did.

52
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,366
And gentlemen--

53
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,400
MAN: Matlock!

54
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,100
Matlock, the stage was held up.

55
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,533
Joe is dead and
Dave was wounded.

56
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,333
There's a girl on the stage,
claims to be your niece.

57
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,400
She's asking for you.

58
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,500
So you are--

59
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,866
I'm Anita, Uncle Matt.

60
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:56,700
My dear, this is certainly
a pleasant surprise.

61
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,733
So tell us, what has happened.

62
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,066
Well I don't know, exactly.

63
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,900
I was heading for town
when I saw the runaway.

64
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,100
And I happened to be
close, so I caught it.

65
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,733
This young lady can probably
tell you more than I can.

66
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,333
Well, first we were
held up by a lone rider.

67
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,033
And then shortly after,
two men held us up again.

68
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,466
And they shot the
guard and the driver,

69
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,066
and then the horses ran away.

70
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,033
And this gentleman caught them.

71
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,833
And I'm mighty grateful, too.

72
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,866
And so am I.

73
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,733
You see, Davis,
it's things like this

74
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,266
that happen every day.

75
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,166
[gunshot]

76
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,766
Look, see that smoke.

77
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
The bullet came straight
on, but from where?

78
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,333
That's just the way the
other man was killed.

79
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,066
MAN: I reckon this is
the end of law and order.

80
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:15,266
Won't nobody run
for sheriff now.

81
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,200
If it's just the
same with you folks,

82
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,933
I'll take this job as sheriff.

83
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,133
You say you could
see the whole street?

84
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:33,633
Unh, me hear shot, look
quick, see no one, only smoke.

85
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:36,600
It's certainly mighty strange.

86
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,333
Unh.

87
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm sure those are the
hombres that held up the stage.

88
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,333
Wait here.

89
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,900
[knocking]

90
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
THE SHADOW: You
needn't explain, boys,

91
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,266
I know everything
that has happened.

92
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:52,333
Keep your eyes on
this new sheriff.

93
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,033
Watch every move, and
report to me in the morning.

94
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,633
Cover my trail, Yak, I'm
going back for the money bags.

95
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:09,366
Unh.

96
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,533
It's the stage bag.

97
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:00,666
Do you suppose he just found it?

98
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:01,733
I don't know.

99
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:05,333
But here's where we
get it, and him too.

100
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:22,200
Unh, two men follow,
look through glass.

101
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,033
Ah, well I figured as much.

102
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,200
Here, take my horse and meet
me at the express office.

103
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,133
Keep this money.

104
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,533
[gunshot]

105
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,166
Hey, it's empty.

106
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,300
Where did he go?

107
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,633
I don't know.

108
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:55,366
Look!

109
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,000
I know we got him.

110
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,766
He can't get far.

111
00:18:11,766 --> 00:18:13,200
Come on, let's find him.

112
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,133
Oh, you stay here and watch.

113
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:45,800
Recon the express company will
be glad to get this money back.

114
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,533
Unh.

115
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,666
[knocking]

116
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:09,200
We trailed him and saw
him pick up the money bags.

117
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,433
Park, here, shot
him of his horse,

118
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,033
but we couldn't find him.

119
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,000
THE SHADOW: He just rode in town
and went in the express office,

120
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,533
probably with the dough.

121
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,700
This is twice you've
gummed things up.

122
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,200
Another fluke like this and
you two guys keep riding.

123
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,433
It's 10 to 1 he knows
who followed him.

124
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:25,700
So you'd better get
back to the hideout

125
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,833
and stay there until
I send for you.

126
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,466
All right, Yak, let's find
out where they'll lead us.

127
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,633
Loco Frank.

128
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,733
He'd cut a man's
throat for a dollar.

129
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:21,433
And Flash Burton, a
lifer from Walla Walla.

130
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,366
And there's Chuckawalla
Red, he's wanted

131
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,433
in every state on the border.

132
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,633
And Slippery Williams,
and Spike Morgan.

133
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,533
(WHISTLE) What a
nest of hornets.

134
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:48,333
And Matlock's ranch
only two miles away.

135
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,300
Wonder if he knows
what's near him.

136
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,133
Maybe we tell him.

137
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,566
No, it might spoil our
chances of getting them.

138
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, my dear, what do
you think of the ranch?

139
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,833
Oh, fine.

140
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,033
But I haven't seen any cattle.

141
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,666
There are no cattle.

142
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,866
They were all stolen
several weeks ago.

143
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:23,233
That's why I've tried to bring
law and order to this valley.

144
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:24,600
Seems useless.

145
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,833
Three men have been
mysteriously shot down.

146
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,866
And the outlaw
activity continues.

147
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:31,066
Well, can't you appeal
to the government?

148
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:32,566
The ranchmen have
written repeatedly,

149
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,000
but nothing has happened.

150
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,900
Oh, where is the
foreman and your boys?

151
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,166
They were in with the rustlers,
and left with the cattle.

152
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,733
And you live here alone?

153
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:43,233
Yes, except for
old Jake, the cook.

154
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:53,600
I'm going over to Matlock's.

155
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,733
Now you stay here and keep
an eye on whoever passes.

156
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:57,466
Unh.

157
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,366
Under the circumstances,
I think we should

158
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:14,366
try and dispose of this ranch.

159
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:16,733
Or at least let
me buy your half.

160
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:19,233
This is certainly no
place for a woman.

161
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,500
Well I quite agree with
you there, Uncle Matt.

162
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,733
I didn't expect to
find it like this.

163
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:27,633
How many for
supper, Mr. Matlock?

164
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,233
Just the three of us, Jake.

165
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,600
Thank you, sir.

166
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,533
Oh, here comes
someone, Uncle Matt.

167
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,766
Well, it's our new sheriff.

168
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,733
Come right in, Mr. Travers.

169
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,066
How do you do?

170
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:52,966
Miss Matlock.

171
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:54,100
How do you do?

172
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,900
Just wanted to tell
you about my good luck.

173
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,800
I found the express money
near the scene of the holdup.

174
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,900
Well, that is good luck.

175
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,066
You see any sign of the robbers?

176
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:07,766
Well, I can't make any
promises right now, Mr. Matlock,

177
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:10,800
but I hope to have the Shadow
and his gang behind the bars

178
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,166
in a very few days.

179
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,400
Well, my boy, I
certainly wish you luck.

180
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,433
I'm afraid that
never can happen.

181
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,033
The shadow is clever.

182
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:22,466
His men are the most desperate
criminals ever banded together.

183
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,000
How do you know?

184
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,233
Why, uh, the cold blooded
manner in which they operate.

185
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,433
Oh, I see.

186
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,866
But I still think I can do it.

187
00:24:31,866 --> 00:24:34,400
Well I certainly hope you do.

188
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,933
Will you excuse me a moment?

189
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:43,833
I suppose you're glad to
be home again, Miss Matlock.

190
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,933
Well, this isn't
exactly my home.

191
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,400
In fact, it's the first
time I've seen the place.

192
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,733
You see, my father and
Uncle Matt owned this ranch.

193
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:55,333
But two years ago
dad was killed.

194
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,533
I inherited his half.

195
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,600
Uncle Matt has
offered to buy me out.

196
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,233
He says this is no
place for a woman.

197
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,866
Oh.

198
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:06,766
He says strange things
happen here at night.

199
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,666
And there are only
the three of us.

200
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,766
Old Jake, Uncle
Matt, and myself.

201
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:15,700
And I'm almost afraid.

202
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,566
THE SHADOW: Hello,
the sheriff will soon

203
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:18,700
be leaving Matlock's ranch.

204
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Wait for him at the crossroads.

205
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,266
There's a girl at the ranch.

206
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:24,900
No harm must come to her,
but scare her away tonight.

207
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,666
All right, I'll have
the boys attend to it.

208
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,500
And don't be afraid to use it.

209
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,633
I won't be.

210
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,033
Won't you stay for
dinner, Mr. Travers?

211
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,933
No, thanks, I have to be going.

212
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,766
I'll see you in the morning.

213
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:52,966
Good day, Miss Matlock.

214
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:53,733
Goodbye.

215
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:15,533
A fine fellow, isn't he?

216
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,733
Yeah.

217
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,333
It's too bad that he's sheriff.

218
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,900
How you skookum, big fun.

219
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:02,966
You boys been a
little too careless

220
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:05,000
with your shooting irons.

221
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,833
So we'll just send you
up for attempted murder.

222
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,200
We're be outta here
by noon tomorrow.

223
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,333
Yeah?

224
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,133
Well thanks for the information.

225
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,066
[bang]

226
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,400
[clatter]

227
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,266
There must be a secret entrance.

228
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,033
I distinctly heard
a third voice.

229
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,133
That's a funny place for a safe.

230
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,400
[knocking]

231
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,766
Here it is.

232
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,733
It's a fake safe.

233
00:30:19,733 --> 00:30:24,733
This must be where the
shadow gives his orders from.

234
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:26,100
[knocking]

235
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:34,166
YAK: (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

236
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,200
Well, this is interesting.

237
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,833
It's a tunnel.

238
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:42,633
Come on, let's see
where it leads.

239
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:27,100
Well, what do you think?

240
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,133
They've hollowed
out this old stump.

241
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:33,966
This is where those
mysterious shots came from.

242
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:36,933
Through this hole, a man could
cover the entire northern part

243
00:31:36,933 --> 00:31:37,666
of the street.

244
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,033
We've got work to
do tonight, Yak.

245
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:46,400
The first thing is to
find a crosscut saw.

246
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:07,366
(HOWLING)

247
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,333
(SCREAMING)

248
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,133
[gunshot]

249
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:36,633
[man screaming]

250
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,200
[gunshots]

251
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,866
Good morning, Anita.

252
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,166
Good morning, Uncle Matt.

253
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:24,600
Did the disturbance
bother you last night?

254
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,433
Oh, not a bit.

255
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:27,199
In fact, I rather enjoyed it.

256
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,565
You should have seen
these so-called ghosts

257
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:32,100
run when I opened fire on them.

258
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,733
Did you do that shooting?

259
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,132
I certainly did.

260
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:37,632
And I intend to
keep on shooting.

261
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:40,833
You know, Uncle Matt,
I've decided not to sell.

262
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,000
I think I'll stay right
here and fight it out.

263
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,400
Well, I, I admire your spirit,
and if that's your decision,

264
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,866
I'm with you.

265
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,533
But your breakfast is ready.

266
00:34:52,533 --> 00:34:54,900
I must hurry to town.

267
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,065
Goodbye.

268
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:56,800
MATT MATLOCK: Goodbye.

269
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:08,566
Morning, Sheriff.

270
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:09,666
Morning.

271
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:10,900
The ranchers are all
here, as you ordered.

272
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,333
Good.

273
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,866
Ask them to stay off the
main street until I'm ready.

274
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,966
I've got a surprise
in store for them.

275
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:18,333
OK, Sheriff, we'll be waiting.

276
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,666
Come on, Yak, let's go.

277
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Come on out, Parker.

278
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,833
Don't worry, it's empty.

279
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,166
Yak, walk the street,
like I told you.

280
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:42,933
Come on, get going.

281
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,666
I'm warning you now, do as I
say or take the consequences.

282
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:06,533
Now listen.

283
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,800
[knocking]

284
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,633
THE SHADOW: You're late.

285
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:24,166
What happened last night?

286
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,933
He had men covering his trail,
we couldn't get near him.

287
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:28,833
THE SHADOW: Well, he's
in his office now.

288
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,566
Get him out in the
middle of the street.

289
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:31,900
The [inaudible] is waiting.

290
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,000
At 11:00 this
morning, I personally

291
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,666
will head the boys into town.

292
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,200
Machine gun will be under the
straw of the covered wagon.

293
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,233
We'll cover one end of the
street, and the boys the other.

294
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,500
We'll take the bank
for a clean-up.

295
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,333
You'll take your
position in the stump.

296
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,433
Get going.

297
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:01,233
Now take off your hat.

298
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:02,566
Put this one on.

299
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,600
Take off that scarf.

300
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,233
You're not gonna send
me out there, are you?

301
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:19,800
You guessed it.

302
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,000
But I got the stump covered,
so I guess you'll be all right.

303
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,833
Get moving.

304
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,800
Get the boys.
-Unh.

305
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,533
Come on.

306
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:46,466
Come.

307
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,100
Sheriff say keep eye on stump.

308
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:32,000
Take it easy, Parker.

309
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,866
Don't move.

310
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,700
Get him, boys.

311
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,866
Get him out of there.

312
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:48,733
We've got you.

313
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,333
Listen, up, you.

314
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,600
You've got just
one chance to live.

315
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,833
Who's the sheriff?

316
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:05,166
Oh, don't shoot, I'll tell.

317
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,400
I'll tell.

318
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,266
It's

319
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:08,233
[gunshot]

320
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:08,966
Ooh!

321
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,066
Boys, we just
missed the shadow.

322
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:05,366
But he's coming back,
he and his gang.

323
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:06,900
They have a machine
gun, and they

324
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,300
intend to wipe out the town.

325
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,833
What's to be done?
-We'll fight.

326
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:10,466
Yeah!

327
00:40:10,466 --> 00:40:11,466
All right!

328
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:13,666
They must never reach town.

329
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,700
We'll surprise them
and head them off.

330
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,233
Pick up all the men you can,
and let every rider wear

331
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:20,966
a white cloth around his
head so we can distinguish

332
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,700
ourselves from the outlaws.

333
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,966
Get you guns and we'll
all meet at Red Gulch.

334
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,733
Men, I was sent here
from Washington,

335
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:31,000
and I'm swearing you all
in as deputy marshalls.

336
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,833
Today you're riding for the
United States government.

337
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,700
Everyone raise his right hand.

338
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Do you solemnly swear?

339
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,833
It just doesn't seem possible.

340
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,866
But it's true, Miss Anita.

341
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:46,333
The night your dad bought
your uncle from the east

342
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,500
was the night this man and
his gang raided the ranch.

343
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,533
Both your dad and
uncle were killed.

344
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,666
He took all your uncle's
papers and his clothes,

345
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:58,000
and passed himself off
in town as Matt Matlock.

346
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,666
The sheriff must
know about this, Jake.

347
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,066
I'm going to tell him right now.

348
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:10,300
Yak here will signal
us from that mountain

349
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,866
when they're coming.

350
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:15,000
We'll let them get by us, and
then attack them from the rear.

351
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,166
Now everybody scatter
and stay hidden.

352
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,500
Are the boys ready?

353
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,533
Yes.

354
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:46,733
Well there's no time to lose.

355
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:47,666
Who's that coming?
