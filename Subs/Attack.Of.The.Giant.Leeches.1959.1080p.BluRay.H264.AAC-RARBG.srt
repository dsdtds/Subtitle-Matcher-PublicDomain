1
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,288
Now wait a minute.

2
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,942
Wait a minute.

3
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,293
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

4
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:57,947
Just hold on a second, Lem.

5
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,600
Liz.

6
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:02,169
You hear me, girl?

7
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:12,918
What you want now?

8
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,535
Gotta play that thing so loud?

9
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:24,452
What you come out like this for?

10
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,280
Oh, don't bother me.

11
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:26,976
Liz.

12
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,417
Someday, I'm gonna give
that she-cat the whoppin'

13
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:35,593
she's been asking for.

14
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:36,333
Sure, you will, Dave.

15
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:37,769
Lay the law down to her.

16
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:41,773
Let her know who wears
the pants around here.

17
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:42,992
I'll be back in a minute.

18
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:47,823
Any whoopin's done
back there, I'll lay

19
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:52,480
you a jug she'll be doing it.

20
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,786
Come on now, Lem, and tell
us about that thing you

21
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,787
killed out there at the swamp.

22
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:56,658
Yeah, Lem.

23
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,225
Let's hear the rest of that.

24
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:02,185
Like I was saying, I put
five slugs into that critter

25
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,361
before it went under.

26
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:06,798
Doggonest thing I ever seen.

27
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,410
Had regular arms on it like a man.

28
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:12,108
But it was sorta different-looking.

29
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,111
Had suckers on them.

30
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:20,290
Like one of them-- like one
of them octopuses things.

31
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,641
Oh, it was plumb awful.

32
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:26,688
Lem, you sure that critter wasn't pink?

33
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,167
No.

34
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,126
I told you before
it was sorta gray-looking.

35
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,697
Well, laugh if you want.

36
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,613
But that thing weren't
nothing nature put out there.

37
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:39,788
No, sir.

38
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:42,617
And it weren't no freak gator neither.

39
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,315
I been poaching this country for 40 years,

40
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,536
and I ain't never seen nothing like it.

41
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,886
Well, too bad you
didn't bring it back.

42
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:54,455
Steve Benton probably pay a
far bounty for whatever it was.

43
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,065
Bounty?

44
00:04:56,108 --> 00:05:00,374
I wouldn't touch that critter
for all the money ever made.

45
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:03,594
And if you'd seen it,
you wouldn't neither.

46
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,987
You better take it
easy on that stuff.

47
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,816
You looking kinda pinked.

48
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,600
Oh.

49
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:13,778
I'm gonna clean my otter
lines out before morning.

50
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:16,738
Lem, I think that critter's
a ghost of one of those otters

51
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,261
you been poaching all these years,

52
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,292
coming back to haunt you.

53
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:25,747
Well, if that's so, you fellas will

54
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,662
see it right quick yourselves.

55
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:43,504
Boy, he's lost it.

56
00:06:08,877 --> 00:06:11,619
Now look, it's not like I
wanna be mean or anything

57
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,447
like that, Liz baby.

58
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,014
I got a reputation around here.

59
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:17,755
These folks have no
respect for a man

60
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,583
who lets his woman boss him.

61
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:21,629
Next thing you know,
they'll be laughing at me,

62
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,458
and they'll be telling all
the rest of the-- won't you

63
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,678
please listen to me, Liz baby?

64
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:28,722
Liz?

65
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,584
Stop looking at me like that.

66
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,107
I'll look at you
any way I want.

67
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,760
You're my wife.

68
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:21,863
Don't touch me.

69
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:24,082
Who do you think
you're talking to?

70
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,440
Don't touch me.

71
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,615
You're my wife.

72
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:28,195
I'll touch you any
time I feel like it.

73
00:07:35,137 --> 00:07:36,264
Where you going?

74
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:43,841
Where you going?

75
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:46,278
I'm going out.

76
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:48,280
Maybe I'll be back.

77
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:49,543
Maybe I won't.

78
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,719
Look, Liz baby,
I didn't mean nothing.

79
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:22,924
Well, there was a young one
in that last trap.

80
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,064
I had to kill it.

81
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,372
Oh, poor thing.

82
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,297
Told you you shouldn't
have come along.

83
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,805
Well, I can understand hunting an animal,

84
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,026
but making it suffer in those traps.

85
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,114
Horrible.

86
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,637
Well, these poachers
know the swamps

87
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,247
like the back of their hands.

88
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,684
But I'll catch one of
them in the act some night

89
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:46,121
and put him away for six months.

90
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:47,601
In the meantime, I'll
have to be satisfied

91
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:49,341
confiscating their trap lines.

92
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:51,518
They lose enough traps, it
won't pay them to keep trying.

93
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,476
Well, be careful, darling.

94
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,999
These people aren't
like other folks.

95
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:57,349
You know, they'll try
and get back at you.

96
00:08:57,393 --> 00:08:58,568
Let them try.

97
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,788
Steve, you're a stranger here.

98
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,051
They've lived this
way for generations.

99
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:05,444
One man isn't gonna
change them overnight.

100
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,185
You're a real worrywort.

101
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,231
I'm serious, Steve.

102
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:10,841
They can be dangerous.

103
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:11,581
OK.

104
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,452
I'll be careful.

105
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:14,923
You just stop worrying.

106
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:23,811
Oh, Steve, I love you.

107
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,025
I love you so much.

108
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:31,688
What was that?

109
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:32,907
I don't know.

110
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,603
You get in the truck
and lock it up.

111
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,775
Listen, Benton.

112
00:10:14,818 --> 00:10:17,560
The coroner ruled that Sawyer
died in a misadventure.

113
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,127
Now as far as this
office is concerned,

114
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,258
that's the end of it.

115
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:21,649
But, Sheriff,
I can't see why there--

116
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:23,697
Look, if Lem was killed
by anything human,

117
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,264
I wouldn't need you
to tell me my job.

118
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:28,353
But I'm not about to go
tromping through the swamp

119
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:30,660
looking for an overgrown gator.

120
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,706
Sawyer wasn't killed
by an alligator.

121
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,098
Is that so?

122
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:35,752
Did you hear that, Morton?

123
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,537
Game Warden Benton says it
wasn't a gator killed Lem.

124
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,191
Well then, what was it?

125
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,628
You know so much,
go on, tell me.

126
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:43,412
What killed him?

127
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:45,544
Doc Greyson said the
wounds were the kind a squid

128
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,590
or a large octopus might cause.

129
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:48,809
Oh, sure.

130
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:51,159
And did Greyson
explain how a saltwater

131
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:54,684
creature happened to be 30 miles
inland, living in Clearwater?

132
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:55,685
Stranger things have happened.

133
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:56,468
I know of--

134
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,687
Look here, Benton.

135
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,950
You work for the state.

136
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,735
Now why don't you keep your
nose out of county business?

137
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:04,955
Is that clear enough for you?

138
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,783
Oh, go soak your fat head.

139
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:11,832
What was that you said?

140
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,529
I said, go soak your fat head!

141
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:23,582
That boy's looking for bad trouble.

142
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,715
And he's sure gonna get it.

143
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,760
You can bet on that.

144
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:40,164
So you see, the octopi uses its
suction disks to hold its prey.

145
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,906
Now in itself, the disk
will not inflict a wound.

146
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,821
Same is true of the squid.

147
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:46,736
Now both creatures
have a parrot-like beak

148
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,478
as their primary offensive
and defensive weapon.

149
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:53,177
Well, maybe the Sheriff was right, dear.

150
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:56,964
Could be a freak or a malformed alligator.

151
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,878
No.

152
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:01,098
No, I'm afraid it wasn't.

153
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:03,535
Well, where does
that leave us, Doc?

154
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,190
I wish I knew.

155
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:07,714
You know, I'm beginning
to think Lem was telling

156
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:09,933
the truth in Walker's store.

157
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:12,806
He did see something
that night, something

158
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,416
that had intelligence
enough to seek

159
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:15,983
him out and destroy him later.

160
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,767
But Sawyer claims to have killed

161
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:20,988
the thing he saw, put a half
a dozen rifle bullets into it.

162
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,120
I've seen that old .44-40 he used.

163
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:26,167
Nothing could live after
being hit with those slugs.

164
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,954
Well, conceding the possibility
of one such creature,

165
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:34,958
we must also concede the
possibility of others.

166
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:38,092
Well, there's one sure way of finding out.

167
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,963
Go in and search every
backwater, channel,

168
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,835
and wet spot in the swamp.

169
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:43,619
If it's there, I'll find it.

170
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,146
Sure is quiet around here.

171
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,441
Did you hear something?

172
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:07,094
Yes.

173
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,711
Well, whatever it was,
it's not here anymore.

174
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,762
Did you want some coffee?

175
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:24,502
Yeah.

176
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:25,199
Thanks, hun.

177
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,900
An army could hide in
here and never be noticed.

178
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,902
Well, one did.

179
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:34,469
What?

180
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:37,864
The Seminoles under
Osceola in the 1830s.

181
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:39,953
Took the US Army two
years to round them up.

182
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:43,217
Oh, I remember reading
about Osceola in high school.

183
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,870
Two years.

184
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:49,440
We've only been at it two
days and I feel worn out.

185
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:52,008
Well, we might as well
keep on looking around.

186
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,302
Well, I guess we may as
well give up for the day.

187
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:27,087
Well, you won't get
any arguments from me.

188
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:15,352
I'm asking you for the
last time, Dave Walker.

189
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:19,400
Will you answer me,
you dirty old man?

190
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:21,402
I ain't dirty, Liz baby.

191
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,360
Liz baby.

192
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:25,232
Liz honey.

193
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,364
Can't you think of anything
else to say, stupid?

194
00:16:27,408 --> 00:16:29,018
I gotta get this order
over to Ms. Showby.

195
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:31,586
She's one of my better customers.

196
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:32,852
Can't keep her waiting.

197
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:38,810
I love you, Liz baby.

198
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,377
Get out.

199
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:41,639
Get out, you fat pig!

200
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:02,486
Did you, um,
have some trouble, Dave?

201
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,053
You know women, Cal.

202
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:07,535
Gotta get their hair
down every now and then.

203
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:10,364
You sure do know an
awful lot about females.

204
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,627
I gotta hand it to you.

205
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,325
I can't stand here jawing, Cal.

206
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,546
Gotta get this order over to Ms. Showby.

207
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,070
What she letting her
hair down about this time?

208
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,203
Well.

209
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:24,465
Ever since Lem
got hisself killed,

210
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:28,338
she wants me to sell
out and move into town.

211
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:30,688
Don't you let her bamboozle you, Dave.

212
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:34,475
You keep her right here in the store.

213
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:38,218
After all, place wouldn't be
the same without you around.

214
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,175
Thanks, Cal.

215
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,307
I better get going.

216
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,091
See you when I get back.

217
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,179
Yeah, I'll be around.

218
00:17:58,977 --> 00:17:59,804
Liz baby.

219
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,635
It's Cal, honey.

220
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,298
You want something, Cal?

221
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:21,696
I sure do, honey.

222
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,018
Tired?

223
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:42,238
Oh, I'm dead.

224
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:44,414
Me too.

225
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,502
Come on over here.

226
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,687
Seems kind of silly
knocking ourselves out

227
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,473
looking for something
we aren't even sure exists.

228
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:02,650
What do you mean?

229
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,956
You know, we've covered
miles of back channel

230
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,785
and haven't come across anything
to support your father's

231
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:10,484
theory of an alien creature.

232
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:14,444
Not so much as a mud print
we couldn't identify.

233
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,360
I know.

234
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,797
You're not gonna give up,
are you, Steve?

235
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:25,412
Well, I-- I can't waste anymore
time on a wild goose chase.

236
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,848
With all respect to
your father's ideas.

237
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,592
But Dad seemed so sure.

238
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:15,679
You're some woman, Liz.

239
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:17,681
I reckon I never met a
woman like you before.

240
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:22,068
You really like me, Cal?

241
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,081
Are you kidding?

242
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,125
Oh, no.

243
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:30,128
I didn't hurt you now, did I?

244
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:33,697
It's just that you're so strong.

245
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:35,569
I-- I like a man who's strong.

246
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:43,446
You sure picked a
doozy, that man Dave.

247
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,622
I don't think he's
got a muscle in him.

248
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,104
Just a big piece of flab.

249
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:54,022
Oh, now, I didn't mean
anything against you.

250
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:58,156
Just that I can't see a--
a real woman like you tying

251
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,575
in with a tub of lard like him.

252
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:06,426
You wouldn't understand, Cal.

253
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:11,779
You know, I--
I wanted to tell you.

254
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:14,477
You just wouldn't understand.

255
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,740
Try me.

256
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:18,307
Come on, you tell
old Cal all about it.

257
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,011
You wouldn't think bad of me?

258
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:27,664
Crazy.

259
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,190
You could tell me you
killed your pa, and your ma,

260
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:36,282
and your whole family,
I'd fight to protect you.

261
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:22,284
My first husband
was a no-good bum.

262
00:22:22,328 --> 00:22:23,885
Couldn't keep a job
more than a week.

263
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:30,423
Used to get lushed up, come
home and beat up on me.

264
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:34,209
He must have been a prize pig.

265
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,865
One night, he tried to
hold up a gas station.

266
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:41,085
He was so drunk, he
couldn't even run.

267
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:44,088
They caught him less
than a mile away.

268
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:46,961
Got set up.

269
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:48,057
I got a divorce.

270
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:53,446
That's rough.

271
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:55,883
After three years working
in a lousy

272
00:22:55,926 --> 00:23:00,235
I was ready for the first guy
that said a nice word to me.

273
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,368
It was Dave.

274
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,500
That's it.

275
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:06,067
God, I wish it had been me.

276
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,505
I'd know how to take care
of a woman like you, Liz.

277
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:11,115
You made it there too late, Cal.

278
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:21,952
You're wrong, woman.

279
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:26,043
It's too late for the both of you.

280
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:28,263
Get up.

281
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,178
Come on, get up.

282
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,614
Now look, Dave.

283
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:33,311
I-- I know what
you're thinking, but--

284
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:37,446
I got double large
shot in this here thing.

285
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,361
You got two seconds
before I pull the trigger.

286
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,803
No point getting riled, Dave.

287
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,502
Wasn't my fault. Why,
she's been pestering me

288
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,417
for months to take her out.

289
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,940
Sure, Cal.

290
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:55,116
I understand.

291
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:58,772
Get her up so I can get a better
look at the lying little tramp.

292
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:01,644
Come on, get her up.

293
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:02,819
Come on, get up.

294
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:03,864
No, Cal.
No.

295
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:04,604
He'll kill me.

296
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:05,735
He'll kill me.

297
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,998
We'll jump him.

298
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,130
Your husband wants to
take a look at you.

299
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:16,267
You-- you walk
all the way, Dave?

300
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:19,314
One more step and I'll
blow you plumb in two.

301
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,490
Get over there.

302
00:24:21,534 --> 00:24:24,188
Now-- now, Dave, it
ain't as bad as you think.

303
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:26,408
Shut up.

304
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:28,497
Tramp.

305
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,611
What are you gonna do?

306
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:31,038
You'll find out soon enough.

307
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:34,808
Dave, you put down
that gun before I

308
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,766
get mad and make you eat it.

309
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,116
You go ahead and try, Cal.

310
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,857
Go right ahead and try.

311
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,164
Move.

312
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:43,817
Move!

313
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,120
Come on.

314
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,121
Come on.

315
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,427
I can't go any further.

316
00:25:29,471 --> 00:25:30,167
No.

317
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:31,342
Come on.

318
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:31,995
Come on.

319
00:25:58,195 --> 00:25:59,457
Go on, run.

320
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,633
Run till you drop.

321
00:26:25,092 --> 00:26:26,615
I'm telling you,
I can't go anymore.

322
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:27,660
I can't.

323
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:28,965
You gotta let me stop running.

324
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:29,966
Shut up.

325
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:35,189
I can't go on.

326
00:26:35,232 --> 00:26:35,842
Cal.

327
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:04,305
Come on.

328
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:06,481
Keep going.

329
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,136
Dave, please, you gotta listen.

330
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,181
It wasn't my fault, honest.

331
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:13,662
She kept playing up to me every
time you turned your back.

332
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:15,664
It wasn't my fault.

333
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,406
You call yourself a man.

334
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,669
You and your muscles.

335
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,671
Shut up, you tramp!

336
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:25,065
If it wasn't for you, I
wouldn't be in this fix,

337
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:27,981
and my old friend Dave wouldn't
be doing this thing to me.

338
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:29,722
It's all your fault.

339
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,071
Oh.

340
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,725
Get going.

341
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:35,423
But-- but, Dave--
Dave, we been friends.

342
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:37,686
We been friends a long time, Dave.

343
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,255
You wouldn't-- you wouldn't
kill an old friend, Dave?

344
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,692
If you don't move, I'll
kill you where you stand.

345
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:44,693
But, Dave--

346
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,655
You brave, big man.

347
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:50,768
Keep going.

348
00:27:54,224 --> 00:27:55,573
I didn't mean it, Dave.

349
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:59,752
I swear, I didn't mean it.

350
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:04,060
Dave, they'll kill us out here.

351
00:28:04,104 --> 00:28:06,410
Please, Dave.

352
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:07,411
I'm sorry.

353
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:09,370
I'm sorry.

354
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:10,284
I'm sorry.

355
00:28:13,635 --> 00:28:15,550
Please, I'm sorry, honey.

356
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:16,899
I'm sorry, Dave.

357
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:17,857
I'm sorry.

358
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,510
I didn't mean it.

359
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:20,860
I didn't mean it.

360
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:21,730
I'm sorry.

361
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,563
You think you've
learned enough to stay

362
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,956
away from my woman, Cal?

363
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,740
Oh!

364
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:33,263
Anything, Dave.

365
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:36,571
I'm ...
I'll do anything you say, Dave.

366
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,095
Anything.

367
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,662
All right.

368
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:41,968
Come on outta there.

369
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,058
Dave!
Dave!

370
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:45,878
Give me a hand.

371
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:49,845
Dave.

372
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,065
My god.

373
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:52,805
Look out.

374
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:53,762
Look out.

375
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:54,545
Behind you!

376
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:18,045
There ain't nothing
down here, sir.

377
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,570
Well, I'm getting tired of this.

378
00:29:21,614 --> 00:29:22,441
Come on in, boys.

379
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,448
Well, if there was
any bodies out there,

380
00:29:29,491 --> 00:29:31,624
we'd have found them.

381
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,018
I want some straight answers, Walker.

382
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,671
And don't give me
any more of that

383
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:38,283
crud about monsters either.

384
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:42,287
Where'd you hide them
after you killed them?

385
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,724
I told you the truth, Sheriff.

386
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:47,596
I didn't kill them.

387
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,992
I just wanted to scare them good.

388
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,821
I love my Liz.

389
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:57,563
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

390
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:58,869
I loved her.

391
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,696
Sure.

392
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,133
You loved her.

393
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,919
That's why you chased her through
the swamp with a shotgun.

394
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:07,486
Come on, Walker.

395
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:10,097
Where'd you hide the bodies?

396
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,751
Won't you believe me?

397
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:12,839
It was some monsters.

398
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:14,188
They--

399
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:18,192
Take him outta here
before I lose my temper.

400
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:19,306
My Liz.

401
00:30:24,764 --> 00:30:26,766
County pay a
reward if'n someone

402
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,812
finds the body, Sheriff?

403
00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:29,864
$50.

404
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:34,382
Each?

405
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:35,435
Yeah.

406
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,130
You know, I never
though that of old Dave.

407
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,784
Course, everybody
knowed that Cal

408
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:49,528
and Liz had a hankering for each
other, everybody but old Dave.

409
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:51,443
Darn fools.

410
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:54,359
Grappling out there in
the middle of the water.

411
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:56,404
If'n them bodies are still in there,

412
00:30:56,448 --> 00:30:59,668
you can bet some old bull
gator's got them stuffed

413
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,888
in his cave under the bank,

414
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:05,979
letting them riping up for a few days.

415
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:09,243
Yeah, well, what we
need now is some long,

416
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:11,680
Cypress poles to go in there
and pole them gator caves.

417
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:28,741
I'm sorry, Doc.

418
00:31:28,784 --> 00:31:30,743
I can't do it.

419
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:31,962
I'll have to do it myself.

420
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:33,267
I wouldn't want to
have to arrest you, Doc,

421
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,921
but I will if I find
you near the preserve

422
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,053
with any explosives.

423
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,315
Steve.

424
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,229
Sorry, Nan.

425
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,013
That's the way it's gotta be.

426
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:41,188
Steve's right, Nan.

427
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,321
It's his job to protect wildlife.

428
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:46,237
What about human life?

429
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,979
Three people have been
killed in that game preserve.

430
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:50,154
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

431
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:51,764
Nan, try to understand.

432
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:53,853
If I could be sure
something in the swamp

433
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:55,463
was responsible for those deaths,

434
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:57,683
I wouldn't hesitate a minute.

435
00:31:57,726 --> 00:32:00,077
We've been together
the last three days.

436
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,818
We didn't see a trace
of anything unusual.

437
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:06,387
Not so much as a suggestion of
any form of life unknown to us.

438
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:07,911
Steve.

439
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:09,260
Something killed those people.

440
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,957
All right, I'll admit
Sawyer's death left

441
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:12,872
a lot of questions unanswered.

442
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,179
But you can bet your bottom
dollar the other two died

443
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:17,050
from Dave Walker's shotgun.

444
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:18,617
Do you really believe that?

445
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,184
Figure it out, Nan.

446
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:22,447
Walker admitted chasing his
wife and Cal into the swamps

447
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,492
after he found them together.

448
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:28,322
He shot them and he tried to
place the blame on Sawyer's DTs.

449
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:30,803
If Sawyer had told us
he'd seen purple giraffes

450
00:32:30,846 --> 00:32:33,545
with polka dot tails, Walker
would've claimed they did it.

451
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:36,287
There's one argument
against that, Steve.

452
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,941
Dave Walker wasn't
the kind of a man

453
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:40,856
to hang himself, not even with
two murder charges against him.

454
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,423
Now I talked with Dave
less than an hour

455
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,077
before he killed himself.

456
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,471
That man was in a state of shock.

457
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:49,126
I've seen frightened men
before, terrified men.

458
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:51,432
But I've never seen anything
to compare with the horror

459
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:53,521
and the fear in Walker's eyes.

460
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,001
Well, he realized
what he'd done.

461
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,222
He killed two people,
and one his wife.

462
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:01,051
Look, Doc, Nan and I
were all over that swamp.

463
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:03,053
Why didn't these
monsters attack us?

464
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:04,706
I've been thinking about that.

465
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,491
They're probably night creatures.

466
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:07,796
They can't stand the light.

467
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,756
They stay down near the
bottom during the day.

468
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,107
A small charge would stun them,
bring them to the surface.

469
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:15,891
Can't buy it, Doc.

470
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:18,894
You're pig-headed, Steve Benton.

471
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:21,462
Stubborn and pig-headed.

472
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:24,754
You just don't understand, do you?

473
00:33:32,516 --> 00:33:33,716
Good night, Doc.

474
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:12,164
Right over there in them reeds.

475
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:31,183
You know, I just can't
figure old Dave out.

476
00:34:31,227 --> 00:34:35,013
If you was caught like
Cal, what would you do?

477
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:38,495
I hadn't thought of that.

478
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:40,801
Right over there
in them reeds is

479
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,281
where that big'un used to be.

480
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:44,022
Yeah.

481
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,198
Caught some great catfish in that hole.

482
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,436
Boy... This is sure a hot one.

483
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:13,337
Right unseasonable.

484
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:17,795
Sure is funny.

485
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:19,275
Huh?

486
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,580
Ain't you noticed anything?

487
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:21,581
No.

488
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:22,713
What?

489
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,845
We been prodding
around here all morning.

490
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,285
Ain't run across a single gator.

491
00:35:28,632 --> 00:35:33,115
By rights, this pool should
be crawling with them.

492
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:34,420
Sure funny.

493
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:36,248
Yeah, that is funny.

494
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,207
I don't like the looks of things.

495
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,991
Let's call it a day.

496
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:41,471
Well now, wait a minute.

497
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,212
We ain't pole the gator
holes around the bend yet.

498
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,431
You do what you wanna do, boy.

499
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:48,130
Just get me on dry land,
and right quick.

500
00:35:48,173 --> 00:35:49,305
All right.

501
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:50,737
Now ain't no use
getting all head up.

502
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:51,850
Let's go.

503
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:57,487
You gotta quit drinking
that moonshine.

504
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,445
Eh.

505
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,317
That's why you're
so wrinkled and ugly.

506
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,715
Coming all the way out
here on a wild goose chase.

507
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,521
We've been calling,
but there's been no answer.

508
00:37:58,564 --> 00:37:59,913
Oh, I just got back.

509
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:01,480
What seems to be the trouble?

510
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:02,873
Well, haven't you heard?

511
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,485
Old Sam Peters and Porky Reed
have disappeared.

512
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:07,617
Come on inside.

513
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,364
You know Kovis.

514
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:16,756
Nothing would please
him more than to have

515
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,324
all the swamp people disappear.

516
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:21,152
Swamp trash, he calls them.

517
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:22,849
I know.

518
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:26,375
They have about as much regard
for him as he has for them.

519
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:28,725
When they're worried
enough to go to him,

520
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:30,814
you know something's wrong.

521
00:38:30,857 --> 00:38:32,468
Mrs. Reed said the
men went searching

522
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,296
for Cal and Mrs.
Walker's bodies,

523
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:36,167
and they never returned.

524
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:38,343
Kovis says he'll get up a
search party if they don't

525
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:42,086
show up in a couple of days.

526
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:44,131
Doc, you and Nan take your
car and get as many volunteers

527
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:45,611
as you can.

528
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:47,787
Tell them to meet me
at the Old Wagon Road.

529
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:51,182
I'll call Doake Evans and
have him bring his dogs.

530
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:54,316
Either they're lost or
they've had an accident.

531
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,346
I hope to heaven you're right.

532
00:40:21,705 --> 00:40:24,839
Well, they picked up the scent, anyway.

533
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:28,059
Dad, do you think they'll find them?

534
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,670
Only the good Lord
can answer that.

535
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,604
Well, at least we
know they got this far.

536
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:51,822
All right, let's
split up into two

537
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,694
parties and circle the lake.

538
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:54,956
Keep your eyes open.

539
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:55,609
Let's move out.

540
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:43,004
All clear.

541
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,658
It's clear over here.

542
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:27,527
All right, let's keep moving.

543
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,335
Well, we can't do
anything more tonight.

544
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:54,728
Might as well start back.

545
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:57,557
I reckon ain't no use
hurrying now, Mr. Benton.

546
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,516
If Reed and old Sam was
alive, they'da let us known

547
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,213
with a holler or something.

548
00:43:02,257 --> 00:43:04,955
Yeah, it kinda looks that way.

549
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,914
You fellas notice
anything about this lake?

550
00:43:06,957 --> 00:43:08,393
I mean, the gators.

551
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:09,133
What about them?

552
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,787
They ain't here.

553
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:14,617
Piece of water this size usually
has maybe 50, 60 big'uns around

554
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,054
and a whole lotta little'uns.

555
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:18,621
It's real unnatural.

556
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:21,189
Well, maybe our torches
scared them away.

557
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,930
Nothing scares gators.

558
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:24,758
Nothing, animal or human.

559
00:43:28,326 --> 00:43:29,327
Well, we might as
well get outta here.

560
00:43:39,947 --> 00:43:42,471
You got something
in mind, Steve?

561
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:46,127
I keep thinking of what
Evans said about the gators.

562
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,304
Nothing scares them,
animal or human.

563
00:43:49,347 --> 00:43:50,914
And yet, something
made them leave.

564
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:54,222
Maybe a-- maybe a
mineral contamination.

565
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,311
Guess I better run
some water samples.

566
00:43:56,354 --> 00:43:59,923
Come on, you two,
drink your coffee.

567
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:03,710
And supposing there
is no contamination?

568
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:06,234
Well then, I'll send over
to Eastport for a diving rig

569
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,018
and go down to look for
this monster of yours.

570
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,542
No, Steve, don't even joke like that.

571
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,022
I'm not joking, Nan.

572
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,371
I had some training
with an Aqua-Lung

573
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:14,372
while I was in the Navy.

574
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:15,722
But, Steve--

575
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:17,680
Look, there are two
bodies we know for sure

576
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:19,029
are down there, maybe four.

577
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,378
They've got to be brought up.

578
00:44:20,422 --> 00:44:22,337
Wait a minute.

579
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,426
There are no alligators in
that part of the swamp, right?

580
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:25,514
So?

581
00:44:25,557 --> 00:44:28,125
No sign of any fish or snakes?

582
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,344
No.

583
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:31,999
What are you getting at, Doc?

584
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,565
Well, there goes your
argument about setting off

585
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:35,480
a dynamite charge under water.

586
00:44:35,524 --> 00:44:37,744
It'd bring the bodies to the surface.

587
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:39,484
Get it out of your mind, Doc.

588
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:42,226
I'm not using any explosives
as long as there's another way.

589
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,619
Why must you be such a--

590
00:44:43,663 --> 00:44:45,099
Stubborn pighead?

591
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:46,578
Exactly.

592
00:44:46,622 --> 00:44:48,276
I'll tell you why.

593
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,669
Number one, there's
bound to be some aquarian

594
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:51,279
life in that section,
even if the bigger

595
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:54,021
forms have abandoned it.

596
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:56,458
Explosion under water would
destroy every living thing

597
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:59,591
and wreck what nature
took years to build up.

598
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:01,593
Number two, I'm paid
to prevent the useless

599
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:04,074
slaughter of wildlife.

600
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,381
Number three, I'd have
to get authorization.

601
00:45:06,424 --> 00:45:07,774
And to get that authorization,
I'd have to come up

602
00:45:07,817 --> 00:45:09,950
with a heck of a good reason.

603
00:45:09,993 --> 00:45:11,046
Satisfied?

604
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:14,563
Finish up, Dad.

605
00:45:14,606 --> 00:45:16,739
I want to go home.

606
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:18,480
Steve.

607
00:45:18,523 --> 00:45:20,308
How long will it take to
get this diving equipment

608
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:21,831
from Eastport?

609
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,921
A couple of days.
Why?

610
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:26,005
Oh, nothing.

611
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:30,831
Take care of yourself, Steve.

612
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:40,588
Well, here's hoping.

613
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:42,329
Dad.

614
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,765
Can't you throw the
dynamite in from here?

615
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:46,942
No. I want to get it out into the middle,
in the deepest part.

616
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:53,732
All right.

617
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:21,768
Stop!

618
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:14,455
It should go any minute.

619
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,169
I just can't figure it out.

620
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:19,354
Walker's wife, why didn't
her body come to the surface?

621
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:20,425
I don't know.

622
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,187
I think I better walk over
to the coroner's office.

623
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,928
What's the matter, Mr. Benton?

624
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:31,584
You feel awkward about arresting
my father in his own home?

625
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:34,282
I warned him I'd arrest
him if he used dynamite.

626
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:35,109
That's nice of you.

627
00:48:38,286 --> 00:48:39,592
Well, the autopsy
should be over by now.

628
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:44,162
Oh, Steve.

629
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:46,642
I thought you'd be here.

630
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:49,732
I don't like to have
to do this, Doctor.

631
00:48:49,776 --> 00:48:51,952
Do we have time for
a cup of coffee first?

632
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,388
Sure.

633
00:48:53,432 --> 00:48:54,955
Do you mind, honey?

634
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:56,625
No. I'll make some sandwiches.

635
00:49:07,576 --> 00:49:11,189
One thing is certain, for
all the good it'll do now.

636
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:12,755
Dave Walker didn't shoot Cal.

637
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:18,022
I'd just come from the autopsies.

638
00:49:18,065 --> 00:49:20,111
Kovis tried to keep me out.

639
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:22,374
But I told him I'd raise a
stink they'd smell all the way

640
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,202
to the capital if he did.

641
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:25,943
Well, what killed them, Doc?

642
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:27,640
Not drowning.

643
00:49:27,683 --> 00:49:31,470
And Cal wasn't shot either.

644
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:35,387
Every drop of blood was
drained out of their bodies.

645
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,956
And they had wounds on their
throats, suction wounds,

646
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:43,047
like a-- like a gigantic
leech might make.

647
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,527
And there's something
even more incredible.

648
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:48,791
Now Cal was supposed to have
been killed several days ago.

649
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:52,752
Sam and Reed had been
missing a matter of 48 hours.

650
00:49:52,795 --> 00:49:55,276
All three of them, as far as
we know, were in that lake

651
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,148
a minimum of two days.

652
00:49:57,191 --> 00:50:00,238
Now I'd stake my reputation as a doctor

653
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,810
that Cal hadn't been dead more than

654
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:03,589
two or three hours
when we found them.

655
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:06,157
And the other two,
less than that.

656
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,073
First stage rigor mortis
started in during the autopsy.

657
00:50:09,116 --> 00:50:12,076
But how could that be, Doc?
It's impossible.

658
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,687
The coroner will confirm it.

659
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,819
Whatever killed them
is still in that lake.

660
00:50:16,863 --> 00:50:18,991
And it's gonna take more
than dynamite to get it out.

661
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,043
Concussion from
those charges would've

662
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,301
killed a full grown whale.

663
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:28,962
That explains how
Cal and the others

664
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,746
lived after they were
supposed to be drowned.

665
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:32,966
What do you mean?

666
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,837
Well, this whole region
is riddled by caves

667
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:38,450
and caverns cut out by the
ocean thousands of years ago.

668
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,755
If there are caves
above the water,

669
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,931
then there must be
caves under the water.

670
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:44,195
Go on.

671
00:50:44,238 --> 00:50:45,979
Mike and I had a
chance to fool around

672
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:49,896
with some frogman equipment
captured from the Italian Navy.

673
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:54,292
We sort of prowled through a
sunken transport off Salerno.

674
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,815
When a ship went down,

675
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:58,547
it trapped some air inside the hull.

676
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,907
We'd go down, come up
inside the officer's lounge,

677
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,301
take off our face masks,
and sort of sample some

678
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,912
of the bottles floating around.

679
00:51:05,955 --> 00:51:07,392
We drove the guys crazy
trying to figure out

680
00:51:07,435 --> 00:51:10,134
how we were getting the stuff.

681
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:12,179
You mean you think that
there's an air pocket

682
00:51:12,223 --> 00:51:13,963
or a cave underneath the lake?

683
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:15,487
Right, gotta be.

684
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,402
How else could those people
have lived down there?

685
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:19,534
Not only that, it explains
how whatever it is down

686
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:20,883
there lived through
the concussions.

687
00:51:20,927 --> 00:51:21,936
Steve.

688
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:26,933
Liz Walker.

689
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:28,674
She might still be down there.

690
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:31,127
Alive.

691
00:51:48,344 --> 00:51:49,084
No.

692
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:50,302
No.

693
00:51:50,346 --> 00:51:50,998
No!

694
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,516
Comfortable?

695
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,214
Yeah.

696
00:52:32,257 --> 00:52:33,954
You sure you don't want me
to go down for you, mate?

697
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:35,608
You haven't had
one of these things

698
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,567
on for a long time, while
me, every other day,

699
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:40,526
I've been playing fish.

700
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,703
Not this time, Mike.

701
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:46,402
If you ask me, they oughtta
have their heads examined.

702
00:52:46,445 --> 00:52:47,794
Giant leeches.

703
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:49,753
Hmph.

704
00:52:49,796 --> 00:52:51,929
I'm willing to bet a month's
pay they don't come up

705
00:52:51,972 --> 00:52:53,974
with nothing more than excuses.

706
00:52:54,018 --> 00:52:55,498
He's crazy.

707
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:58,718
Him, the Doc, and his brat too.

708
00:52:58,762 --> 00:53:01,547
Just wait till I get on
the phone with the capital.

709
00:53:01,591 --> 00:53:03,419
I'll guarantee somebody will
wish they had kept their nose

710
00:53:03,462 --> 00:53:05,334
out of other people's business.

711
00:53:05,377 --> 00:53:06,639
I'll guarantee that.

712
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,209
Let's go, Mike.

713
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:18,651
Steve.

714
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,826
Be careful, please.

715
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,219
Don't worry.

716
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:22,089
Mike will be ready if
anything goes wrong.

717
00:53:22,133 --> 00:53:23,569
Don't worry about Steve.

718
00:53:23,613 --> 00:53:24,962
Now if he were going after a barracuda,

719
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:27,921
you might have a tiny bit to worry about.

720
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:28,974
Ready, Mike?

721
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,886
No, no, please stay away.

722
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:22,759
Please.

723
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:25,109
Not exactly inviting, is it?

724
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:27,764
It sure isn't.

725
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:28,973
Hold her steady, Mike.

726
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:52,005
It'll stop anything
up to a tiger shark.

727
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:53,355
But you gotta hit.

728
00:54:53,398 --> 00:54:55,139
Misses don't count.

729
00:54:55,182 --> 00:54:57,141
Now anything goes wrong,
just yank on the line.

730
00:54:57,184 --> 00:54:57,881
I'll be down in a hurry.

731
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,931
You sure you don't want me
to go down and finish it off

732
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:33,019
for you, Steve?

733
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:34,064
No thanks, Mike.

734
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:37,110
I-- I think I hurt
it pretty bad.

735
00:56:37,154 --> 00:56:38,416
Careful now.

736
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,765
Anything hurt's 10
times as dangerous.

737
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,077
He's wounded it.

738
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,296
He's gonna finish it off.

739
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,821
Does he have to go under again?

740
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:55,128
He's got to make sure, honey.

741
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:57,043
Where could it have come from?

742
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,394
I wish I knew.

743
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:01,396
We'll have to make some tests.

744
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:04,486
Maybe the proximity of Cape Canaveral's
got something to do with it.

745
00:57:04,529 --> 00:57:06,270
The rocket station?

746
00:57:06,313 --> 00:57:09,229
Well, they use atomic energy in
the first stages of launching.

747
00:57:09,273 --> 00:57:11,623
Not all of them have
been successful.

748
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:14,060
You think that it's an animal
life that was close by,

749
00:57:14,104 --> 00:57:16,236
not close enough to be killed,
but close enough

750
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,325
to feel the effects of
a radioactive energy that--

751
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,066
A mutation.

752
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:24,984
A type of gigantism
of some common animal.

753
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:27,770
Whatever it is, I hope
he's able to bring it up.

754
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:29,658
That-- that can't be Liz.

755
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:37,317
What could have done that?

756
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:38,275
Look at her face.

757
01:00:02,794 --> 01:00:03,534
What's that?

758
01:00:03,578 --> 01:00:06,624
Look at that thing.

759
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:07,886
I've been around here for years.

760
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,148
I never saw nothing
like that before.

761
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:17,477
There was no sign
of them this time.

762
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:20,263
They must be licking
their wounds.

763
01:01:20,306 --> 01:01:22,178
Are you sure you used enough
stuff to do the job, Mike?

764
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,136
I used 100 sticks of 40%.

765
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,051
Oughtta blow the bottom right out.

766
01:01:26,095 --> 01:01:26,791
All right.

767
01:01:26,835 --> 01:01:27,923
Let her go.

768
01:01:27,966 --> 01:01:29,011
Oh, no.

769
01:01:29,054 --> 01:01:30,534
I've done enough
of your dirty work.

770
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:31,704
Help yourself.
