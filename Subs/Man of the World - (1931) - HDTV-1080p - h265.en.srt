1
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,080
Well, well, well!

2
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:45,003
Jimmie Powers.
You old son of a gun.

3
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:47,380
I'm afraid there must be
some mistake.

4
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:52,343
You trying to kid me, Jimmie? What
do you know? He's trying to kid me.

5
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:56,556
L-Let me get this straight. You mean
to tell me you're not Jimmie Powers?

6
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,058
I'm afraid that's exactly
what I mean to tell you.

7
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,060
Well, I've heard everything.

8
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:04,522
Say, if you aren't Jimmie Powers,
I'll... I'll eat your hat.

9
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:10,361
Well, in that event, I suppose I really owe
it to you to make assurance doubly sure.

10
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,673
Oh, as I thought.

11
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:35,595
I am not Mr. Jimmie, uh, uh...
What was it, uh... Powers at all.

12
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,973
Well, I'll be whatever it is. Of
course, now, I might be mistaken.

13
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:42,643
Perhaps I should take up the habit of
carrying my birth certificate around with me.

14
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:46,522
Come on, Joe. I told you not
to take that last double Bronx.

15
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,524
If you gentlemen will excuse me.

16
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,694
Please convey my compliments,
to Mr., uh, uh, uh, what's-his-name,

17
00:02:51,778 --> 00:02:54,447
and tell him that I don't really
resemble him on purpose.

18
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,532
Good day, gentlemen.

19
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:02,163
Oh, come on, Joe.

20
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:05,041
I never heard of
anything like it before.

21
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:08,086
Jimmie Powers.
And he says he ain't.

22
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:11,714
You could be mistaken,
couldn't ya? No, I couldn't.

23
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:16,094
Why, he was the managing editor
of that newspaper back in Springfield.

24
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:18,137
I used to...
Six years ago.

25
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,723
I used to run into him every day.

26
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,768
And then he got into
some kind of a jam and...

27
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:27,188
Just disappeared.
What kind of a jam?

28
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:32,276
Well, the way I got it was that he... he was
playing nature's nobleman to somebody or other...

29
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,864
that fell down on him, and so
he took the rap and said nothing.

30
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:39,283
Maybe he was trying to
high-hat you just now.

31
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,619
Not the Jimmie Powers
I used to know.

32
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:44,956
Why, he was the most promising
newspaperman in the country.

33
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,708
Oh, what of it?
It's no skin off your back, is it?

34
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,389
Uh, Mr. Taylor, please.
Michael Trevor calling.

35
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:04,475
Mr. Taylor said you were to
come right up. Room 309, sir.

36
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,519
Thank you.

37
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:32,920
How are you, Mr. Trevor? Glad to
see you. How are you, Mr. Taylor?

38
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:36,007
Come on in. Sit down. Thank
you. Well, it's nice to see you again.

39
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:39,844
I tried to call you up myself, but I
didn't know where to get hold of you.

40
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:43,181
I guess I was a little tight that
day I met you at the Ritz. Oh.

41
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:45,183
I kind of forgot
to get your phone number.

42
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:47,310
Well, I got yours.
So, here we are.

43
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:49,645
Yep. Here we are.
Have a drink?

44
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,647
Oh, thank you, no.

45
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:56,277
I, uh... I had a purpose in phoning you
this morning, Mr. Taylor.

46
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,071
Aside from my desire to see
you again, of course. Glad you did.

47
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:01,157
I'll try to be as brief as possible.

48
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,119
I don't know if you know very much about me.
Oh, sure, I do. You're just being modest.

49
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,705
Oh, thank you. I've heard
a lot about you, Mr. Trevor.

50
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:10,541
Yeah? They tell me you're
over here writing a great novel.

51
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,419
Ah. I wish I could be as sure
of that as they are.

52
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:17,840
Well, all I know is that some four years
ago I quit being a newspaperman in America.

53
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:20,051
Now I'm over here to see
if I can really write.

54
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,887
You've been in Paris four years?

55
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:26,224
I wish I could stay over here four
years. Hmm. I've only been here a week.

56
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:29,936
For the most part, we have a very nice crowd
of Americans living here in Paris permanently.

57
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:32,772
Paris is certainly a liberal education.
Isn't it?

58
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:36,567
I thought I'd seen a lot, but let
me tell you. These Frenchmen...

59
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:39,237
Uh, French.
And how!

60
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:45,076
Unfortunately, there are a few Americans living in
this town who are not exactly all they might be.

61
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:48,412
Frankly, there's only a handful, but
they're what I've come to see you about.

62
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:52,250
There was a little redhead at the Folies-Bergere
the other night. And let me tell you...

63
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,544
Ah, yes. I know. I know.

64
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:58,422
Now, uh, these fellows
I'm talking about, Mr. Taylor,

65
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:01,759
live by their wits... and by
other people's lack of them.

66
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,886
I ran into one of them last night.

67
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,931
He helps get out a weekly
paper here, printed in English.

68
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:10,518
No good here.
Me, I didn't come to Paris to read.

69
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:13,271
Uh, this paper isn't
circulated much in Paris.

70
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:16,190
It's meant chiefly
for American consumption.

71
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,734
This fellow was drunk,
and he talked too much.

72
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,820
Much too much.

73
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:25,616
Among other things, he showed me a copy of an item
they're going to run in their next week's issue.

74
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:28,619
I... put it in my pocket
when he wasn't looking.

75
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:31,289
Well, fine. Just leave
it here, and I'll read it.

76
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,709
Well, I think you had better
read it right away.

77
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:37,962
It's, uh... It's about you.
About me?

78
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,715
Well, what's it say?

79
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:42,842
Well...

80
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,969
Shall I read it to you?
Sure.

81
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,930
It says,

82
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:53,936
" Tis a pity that some of our compatriots
are so naive and lacking in worldly knowledge.

83
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,649
"Surely Mr. Harold Taylor, the soft
coal baron of Stratford, Pennsylvania,

84
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:03,404
"could not have been aware of the identity of
the very blonde and very beautiful young woman...

85
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:07,742
with whom he seemed to be on such intimate
terms at Zelli's the other morning at 4:00."

86
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:15,499
"With whom he seemed to be on such intimate
terms at Zelli's the other morning at 4:00.

87
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,462
"Those in the know
were forced to smile broadly...

88
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,965
"as this strangely assorted couple
left the restaurant...

89
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:25,051
"arm in arm.

90
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,303
Watch your step, Harry boy."

91
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:33,225
We, uh, got so well acquainted
that day at the Ritz, Mr. Taylor,

92
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:36,520
that I thought I'd take the liberty
of bringing this item to you.

93
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,608
You could do those of us
living here a great service.

94
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:44,028
We know who gets out this sheet.
And what we would like you to do...

95
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,490
is to take this item to the police
and get the whole gang arrested.

96
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,492
Arrested?
Exactly.

97
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:53,621
You're a man of the world, and you know that
the kind of fellow back of a thing like that...

98
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:57,041
can't last 10 minutes if the
police are put on his trail. Police?

99
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,211
You could put him where he belongs::
Behind the bars.

100
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:03,130
Say. Just a minute.

101
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:07,551
If I... If I go to the police,
it'll get in the papers, won't it?

102
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,388
Probably. Well, that's
something I don't want any part of.

103
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:13,891
Ah, but, Mr. Taylor... I can't afford
to have this item get back to America.

104
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:18,020
And I... I can't afford to let it
be known that I had it stopped.

105
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:22,608
Well, I'm sorry.

106
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:27,738
It's always the same old thing. Every time we get
something on this fellow that could send him to jail,

107
00:08:27,822 --> 00:08:29,824
the victim is unwilling
to prosecute.

108
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:33,327
I'd like to help you out,
but... but I can't.

109
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,454
I suppose not.

110
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:38,749
Well, I'm sorry I wasted
your time, Mr. Taylor.

111
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:42,294
I'll say good day.
Good-bye.

112
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,672
Oh. Oh, just a minute.
Uh, wait a minute.

113
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:49,510
How would I go about getting
this fella not to print this little item?

114
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:53,431
Well, I don't know.

115
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:56,392
I don't suppose it would be
very difficult. You think not?

116
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:59,103
It would be worth something
to me not to have it appear.

117
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:01,731
Say, I wonder if
you'd do me a favor?

118
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:07,611
Most certainly. If I can. How about,
uh, you seeing this fellow for me?

119
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:11,490
My seeing him? Yes. He'd probably
listen to you, where he wouldn't to me.

120
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:14,493
Chances are he'd
try to hold me up for more.

121
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:18,956
Of course, uh, I'd be prepared
to pay something for it.

122
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:21,792
Pay him, of course.
Oh. Oh. I didn't mean, uh...

123
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:24,920
Say, you'd be doing me an awful
service if you'd help me out on this.

124
00:09:25,004 --> 00:09:28,132
Well, I'll certainly be glad
to do anything I can. Ah.

125
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:30,676
Suppose a couple of thousand? Uh...

126
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:42,480
Wait a minute.
Comment?

127
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:45,524
Don't pull up your flag.
Comment?

128
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:48,778
Why do I always have to get
chauffeurs who don't speak English?

129
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:53,824
There. Now maybe he'll get
the idea I want him to wait.

130
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,868
Don't you want to
come in a minute, Frank?

131
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,123
Not a chance. If I'm going to get back here and take you
to dinner by 7:00 and then catch that train for London,

132
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:05,336
I've got to get home and pack and send
a couple of wires. There it goes again.

133
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,005
There what goes again?
Business.

134
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,424
Oh, Mary.
I know you have to go, Frank,

135
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,385
but it's that kind of thing that
keeps me from making up my mind.

136
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:18,182
I don't want to... to get engaged to a man who
thinks of nothing but business all the time.

137
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:21,894
Oh, Mary, if you'd only say you'll
marry me, I'd cut out business...

138
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:23,896
If you wanted me to.
That's just it.

139
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:27,733
I don't want you to stop doing the things
you want to do, just on account of me.

140
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:29,735
What do you want me to do?

141
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:32,154
I wish I knew.

142
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:34,824
I was only fooling, Frank.
I'm not really mad.

143
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:38,410
I wish you'd blow a whistle from now
on when you're fooling. I never can tell.

144
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:42,206
I never want you to be able to tell.

145
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,458
We seem to be causing a traffic jam.

146
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:48,087
They can work up a tra... traffic jam
in this town with just one car.

147
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,464
7:00. Don't forget.
I won't.

148
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:57,012
The Hotel Henri Quatre. And whatever the
French is for "Try and get me there alive."

149
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:02,560
I can't tell you how much
obliged I am to you, Mr. Trevor.

150
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,562
I'll see that he gets this.

151
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:08,023
I think I can guarantee you this is
the last you'll hear of the matter.

152
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:11,318
From what they say of this fellow, he
seems to be living from hand to mouth,

153
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:14,238
so I'm sure your donation will be
more than enough to shut him up.

154
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,284
That's great. Of course, I would have
rather had you bring charges against him.

155
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,578
Oh, no, no. No, no.
That's out of the question.

156
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:24,081
Well, I suppose so. I wish you'd have
dinner with me some night before I go.

157
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:27,418
Oh, thank you. I don't get out very
much, but if I do get the chance...

158
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,879
Uh...
Oh. Excuse me.

159
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:32,798
That's all right, Mary. Come
right in. This is a friend of mine.

160
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:36,802
A real good friend of mind. Mr. Trevor.
Mr. Trevor, this is my niece Mary. Mary Kendall.

161
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,804
How do you do, Mr. Trevor?
How do you do?

162
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:40,973
Been shopping?
A little.

163
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:44,727
Uh, where's Frank? Mean to tell me
he's left you alone for five minutes?

164
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,439
Received a wire to come to London tonight. He's
going to meet that Dutch inventor tomorrow.

165
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:51,609
I wish you could meet Frank. He's
a fine boy. He and Mary are going...

166
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,861
Uncle Harry has the soul
of a matchmaker, Mr. Trevor.

167
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,780
Just because Frank and I grew up
together and are fond of each other...

168
00:11:56,822 --> 00:12:01,952
Well, in my time, you didn't need much more than
to grow up together and be fond of each other.

169
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:05,122
Wait till you meet him, Mr. Trevor.
He's got the stuff, that kid.

170
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:09,185
He's going to be one of the richest men in the state before
he's through. I'm sure Mr. Trevor isn't interested...

171
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,296
You're right. I... I guess
I do talk a little too much.

172
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,175
I'm afraid I'll have to be running along
now. I wish you'd wait and have a drink.

173
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:18,928
Oh, thank you. Some other
time perhaps. Say, wait. Uh...

174
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:20,930
I'll bet you know
all the places in Paris.

175
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,307
Where's a good place to
have dinner? Oh, Uncle Harry.

176
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,309
Oh, it's a pleasure, Miss Kendall.

177
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:28,395
Well, let's see. There's Ciro's of
course, but all Americans go there.

178
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,358
Yes. We did. Uh, have you
tried, uh, the Paradis d'Azur?

179
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,401
Paradis d'Azur?
"Blue Heaven"? Yes.

180
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,403
Oh. Good orchestra?
Excellent.

181
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,530
We'll try it tonight.
Thank you.

182
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:40,783
Good-bye, Miss Kendall.
Good-bye, Mr. Trevor.

183
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:43,410
Good-bye, Mr. Taylor.
Good-bye. And thanks a thousand.

184
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:45,496
Uh, two thousand.

185
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:54,630
That's one swell guy, that fellow.
Is he?

186
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,674
I'll say so.

187
00:12:57,883 --> 00:13:00,594
He did me a big favor.

188
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:04,014
I'd certainly like to do something for
him sometime. Some business deal?

189
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:06,058
Well, yes and no.

190
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,646
He's a writer living in Paris.
I'd like to live in Paris.

191
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:15,442
Me too. Of course, a fellow
would have to watch his step, but...

192
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:18,696
I'll bet it'd be a lot of fun
once you got to know the place.

193
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:21,740
How do you like my new hat?
Oh, it's a humdinger.

194
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:26,203
Why don't you come along to dinner with me and
Frank tonight? No, no. I have a business meeting.

195
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:28,664
I hope this business meeting
breaks up before daylight.

196
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:32,084
Do you know what time the elevator
man told me you got in last night?

197
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,963
There's a fortune waiting for any
elevator man who can't tell time.

198
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,499
Bonsoir, Marie.
Bonsoir, Monsieur Trevor.

199
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:15,919
How is every little thing, big boy?
Hotsy-totsy?

200
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:18,714
Hmm. You're getting on, Marie.

201
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:20,924
Thank you.
Thank you.

202
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,681
Good evening, Louis. Good
evening, Monsieur Trevor.

203
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:31,685
Well? Only table four
and 17, Monsieur Trevor.

204
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:37,149
The lady at table four is a
Mrs. Jowitt, from St. Louis.

205
00:14:44,907 --> 00:14:46,909
Do you think I'd better?

206
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,746
Well, here's to you.

207
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:57,002
Why, that's the Mrs. Jowitt
who got here last month, isn't it?

208
00:14:57,044 --> 00:15:00,547
She's just a babe in the woods...
Especially for Spade Henderson.

209
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:03,675
The waiter reports
that Mrs. Jowitt...

210
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,179
picked up Spade
at Henry's Bar an hour ago.

211
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:10,390
Well, I may make this Mrs. Jowitt
the object of my good deed today.

212
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:14,353
I am at peace with the world, Louis.
Fortune has been kind to me.

213
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:17,022
Besides, it might be just as well
for my friend Henderson...

214
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:20,317
to learn to follow my rule of keeping
women off his list of customers.

215
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,653
Excellent rule, Mr. Trevor.

216
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:26,281
And, uh, number 17?

217
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:30,452
A very, very wealthy
Mr. Bradkins from Chicago.

218
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,045
The prettiest hand I ever saw.

219
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:45,259
The lady with him is not his wife.

220
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:49,304
Not his wife? Louis, I'm afraid
you're losing your illusions.

221
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:52,182
The pleasantest of occupations,
Monsieur Trevor. Mmm.

222
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:54,268
I wonder.

223
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,146
This note may be
of interest to Spade.

224
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,148
He needn't know who sent it.

225
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,358
Yes, Mr. Trevor.
Thank you, Louis.

226
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,456
How do you do?
Good evening.

227
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,420
No supper, Louis.
Just a small bottle of Perrier.

228
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,505
Yes, Monsieur Trevor.

229
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,225
Who was that? A friend of Uncle
Harry's. I met him this afternoon.

230
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,187
Another old friend whom your
uncle never saw before today.

231
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,148
Oh, you never can tell. Uncle
says he's a very clever novelist.

232
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,150
What's his name?
Trevor.

233
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,534
Pardon me.
Certainly.

234
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:12,930
Who gave you this note? It was left
at the door, monsieur, a moment ago.

235
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:14,973
I see.
Bad news?

236
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:18,602
I... Say, Mrs. Jowitt,
I wonder if you'd excuse me?

237
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:21,939
Why? What's the matter?
Uh, an important call.

238
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,692
I've gotta see a fella right away.
Oh, here. Wait a minute.

239
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:28,946
I thought we were going to
go places and do things.

240
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:32,908
Sorry. Some other time maybe.
I've gotta run. So long.

241
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,453
Well,

242
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:41,083
if this is Paris, something
tells me I'm not going to like it.

243
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:45,170
Oh, Frank,
I wish you weren't going.

244
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,381
I'll only be gone 10 days... or less.

245
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,466
Ten days is pretty long.

246
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:52,970
I wouldn't be going if I didn't
have to see this fellow.

247
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:57,015
I wish I could have gotten
a stateroom.

248
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,019
I get seasick so easy,

249
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,605
and the thought of having to
sit up for three hours...

250
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:07,276
while I'm being tossed around on that
channel doesn't make me any too happy.

251
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,572
Sometimes I think I'd have been better
off if I'd spent my summer in Pittsburgh.

252
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,950
There must be some way
of getting a stateroom.

253
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:19,037
The porter at the hotel did everything
he could. He said there wasn't a chance.

254
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:22,332
Phone the company. Maybe
somebody turned back a reservation.

255
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,668
That's a great idea.

256
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,963
No. I've changed my mind.
It's a terrible idea.

257
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:31,174
I'd rather swim the Channel than
tackle one of these French phones.

258
00:18:31,216 --> 00:18:34,511
But you've got to get a stateroom.
Not if I have to phone, I don't.

259
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:38,849
Oh, you big baby. If you won't do
something, I will. I know who can do it.

260
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:50,485
You've got a lot of crust,
if you ask me, Mary.

261
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,529
Mr. Trevor, may I present
Mr. Reynolds?

262
00:18:52,612 --> 00:18:55,532
How do you do, Mr. Reynolds?
Won't you sit down, Mr. Trevor?

263
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:58,452
Oh, thank you.
I wonder if you'd do us a favor?

264
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,746
Of course. Gladly.
Frank has to go to London tonight.

265
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:04,499
He was going to fly this afternoon, but they
called off the service on account of fog.

266
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,669
Now he has a ticket on the boat, but
no stateroom. They were all sold out.

267
00:19:07,753 --> 00:19:11,548
You would like me to help you to get a
stateroom. Is that it? You get the general idea.

268
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,759
Ah, yes. Max.

269
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,761
Oui, monsieur.

270
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:20,265
Uh, what time does your train
leave, Mr. Reynolds? 2:00.

271
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:28,190
Merci.

272
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:30,192
Is that all?
Uh, that's all.

273
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,944
I asked him to wire the purser.
He's a friend of mine.

274
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,781
There'll be a stateroom waiting
for you in my name. Thank you.

275
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:37,783
How about a little wine,
Mr. Trevor?

276
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,993
Oh. I think not.
Thank you.

277
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:42,287
We're awfully obliged to you.
Oh, not at all.

278
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:44,414
How is Paris treating you?
Pretty well.

279
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:47,417
I'm afraid we don't know
the places to go to.

280
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:51,671
I think this place is lovely, but I
would like to see some French people.

281
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,841
This has been a favorite hangout
of Americans for years.

282
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:58,095
The prices are higher here
than anywhere else.

283
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:06,311
Uncle Harry says you know Paris so well,
Mr. Trevor. Where should we go from here?

284
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:11,191
Well, if you've time, uh, there's a little place
I make a habit of dropping into at night...

285
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,276
just before going to bed
when I'm really hungry.

286
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:16,405
If you like, uh,
why not come there with me?

287
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:18,448
It's very French.
Say, that's an idea.

288
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,535
But surely we've taken all the
advantage of you... Oh, not at all.

289
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:26,039
If you're sure we wouldn't be intruding. I'd like
to get away from this tourist stuff for awhile.

290
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:30,210
Well, uh, will you be my guests? Not to
give you a short answer, Mr. Trevor, yes.

291
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:32,546
Good.

292
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:34,548
May I?
Ready, Frank?

293
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:39,594
I suppose so. I never know whether I'm
getting change or owe the place money.

294
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:43,473
Merci, monsieur.

295
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:04,327
If you say this is the real stuff,
I suppose it is.

296
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:06,913
But I had Paris figured out
all different.

297
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, I suppose Paris means
something different for everyone.

298
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,377
For you, I imagine it means clothes.

299
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:16,923
To Mr. Reynolds, uh, an interlude.
Pause between business deals.

300
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:20,385
To your uncle,
I daresay it means, uh, change.

301
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,096
And to you?

302
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,182
I don't know.

303
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,350
There was a time
when it meant everything:

304
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,394
Gaiety, glamor, adventure.

305
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:33,148
Now...
And now?

306
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:38,069
Now it's just a place to live...

307
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:40,489
and eat onion soup
at 1:00 in the morning.

308
00:21:42,574 --> 00:21:45,535
In America at this hour
I suppose it would mean chop suey.

309
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:48,371
Give me chop suey every time.

310
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:51,958
I don't know
but what I agree with you.

311
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,504
You know, years ago
I used to be a... a reporter.

312
00:21:56,505 --> 00:22:02,427
After we put the paper to bed at night, we used to stop in
at a little place on the corner for chop suey and, uh...

313
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:04,054
Foo Yong.

314
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:06,598
Foo Yong.

315
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,600
I hadn't thought of that
for years.

316
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:12,395
I suppose living in Paris makes up for
not having a bowl of chop suey.

317
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,481
I suppose so.

318
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,361
It's not the chop suey you miss.

319
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,404
It's what it stands for.

320
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,740
Home. America. Friends.

321
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:26,368
Fellows I used to know.

322
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,578
Plain things without sauces.

323
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:30,705
Hello, Mr. Trevor.

324
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:33,917
Oh, hello, Fred. Off your beaten
path a bit tonight, aren't you?

325
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,919
Yes. I guess I am.

326
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:39,381
You know, these folks want to see all
the sights marked on the picture postcards.

327
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:44,970
I'm beginning to think they've been
getting the wrong kind of postcards.

328
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:48,431
The best American guide
in Paris, that fellow.

329
00:22:48,473 --> 00:22:51,393
He doesn't seem to be
any better than you are.

330
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:59,401
That man back there
was Michael Trevor.

331
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:03,530
Very prominent American writer.
Very prominent.

332
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:05,865
What's he written?
Books.

333
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,867
Novels I guess you'd call 'em.

334
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:12,455
But I don't know. When you get right down
to it, what are they? Nothing but books.

335
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:20,297
It's five past 1:00.
I've got to be going.

336
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:24,593
It's been very nice of you to show us around
like this, Mr. Trevor. Ah. My pleasure.

337
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:29,180
I'll only be gone 10 days. I'd be tickled to death
if you'd be my guest some night when I get back.

338
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:31,182
Thank you.
You'd better hurry back.

339
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:35,186
Uncle Harry will go out of his mind if has
to spend all his time with me. Pretty tough.

340
00:23:35,228 --> 00:23:38,565
His first week in Paris, and having
to take you around wherever he goes.

341
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:42,068
I can't imagine his ever regarding
you as a burden. Only in Paris, I hope.

342
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:44,779
Oh. If I can, uh, relieve him
of any part of it...

343
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:47,657
If you could take Mary around
a bit, that would be great.

344
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:52,037
Oh. That's fine. Now all we need
is Mar... uh, Miss Kendall's consent.

345
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,914
Mary consents with
very unmaidenly rapidity.

346
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,500
Come on. Let's go now.
It's late.

347
00:23:57,584 --> 00:23:59,544
Thank you.

348
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,796
Bonsoir, Monsieur Trevor.

349
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Pierre.

350
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:10,680
I'd like to call you tomorrow, if I may.
There's a special cup race at Longchamps.

351
00:24:10,764 --> 00:24:14,726
Oh, I'd love to go! Good. Suppose I
call for you tomorrow at, uh, 1:00?

352
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,728
Oh, that'll be fine.

353
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:22,067
Well, I think I'll walk home. I wouldn't dare
walk five steps from this door. I'd get lost.

354
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,861
There'll be a taxi along, uh,
almost any minute, I'm sure.

355
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:27,405
Thanks a lot for showing
us around. Not at all.

356
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:29,407
Until tomorrow then?
Good night. Good night.

357
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:31,785
Good night.

358
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:34,204
I like that guy.
He's very nice.

359
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:37,207
He's... Well, I mean, he's, uh...

360
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,209
He's very charming
and sophisticated.

361
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,255
It's a great break for you to get a man like that, that
knows all about Paris to ask you to go out with him.

362
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:48,510
To ask me to go out with him? Don't
be silly. We did everything but lasso him.

363
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:51,054
Taxi! Come on, Mary.

364
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:56,059
If I'd say "Hotel de Régent," where do
you think we'd wind up? Let's find out.

365
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:00,021
Hotel de Régent.

366
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:26,589
2:00. And he said
he'd be here by 12:00.

367
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:30,176
Think of the places I could have gone,
the things I could have done.

368
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:32,512
He'll probably be along
any day now.

369
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:34,681
No need getting up
oh your ear about it.

370
00:25:34,764 --> 00:25:36,683
Nothing's happened to him.

371
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:39,853
I told you. I saw him myself at
Papa Jules's less than an hour ago.

372
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:42,689
Well, I'm not gonna wait around
half the night for him.

373
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:46,025
You've had a lot of practice doing it.

374
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,361
Maybe.

375
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:51,281
But I quit worrying about him
personally six months ago.

376
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:54,576
Kind of mutual, wasn't it?

377
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,579
Mutual or not, strictly business.

378
00:25:57,662 --> 00:25:59,622
That's little Irenie from now on.

379
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:02,000
You know, I don't mind
your kidding me,

380
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:05,628
but I kind of hate
to see you kid somebody else.

381
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:08,965
Somebody else?
Yourself.

382
00:26:19,517 --> 00:26:21,436
Now, wouldn't you know it?

383
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,023
It's all your life is worth to even
turn around in this room.

384
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:30,236
Say, that guy's got books
where I wouldn't put... hairpins.

385
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,238
What does he do with them all?
Read them?

386
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:35,784
Well, what do you suppose he does?
Practice juggling?

387
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:38,411
Say, that cuckoo
would rather read than eat.

388
00:26:40,038 --> 00:26:42,373
The Money Systems of the Middle Ages.

389
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:45,043
There's a hot subject for you.

390
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:51,216
As far as I'm concerned, there's
just one little book we need. That's all.

391
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,218
Just one.

392
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:55,261
Good old Dun & Bradstreet:

393
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,514
Who's who,
and how much has he got?

394
00:26:57,555 --> 00:27:01,684
When you're through with a guy,
it's how much did he have, isn't it?

395
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:04,687
I manage to get along pretty well.

396
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:08,191
If you only weren't so shy
and uncommunicative, Irene.

397
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:10,235
Fancy seeing you here!

398
00:27:11,402 --> 00:27:15,031
You must have forgotten. You were
supposed to meet us here two hours ago.

399
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:17,075
Oh, so that was it.

400
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:21,371
Somehow I, uh, couldn't recall
what it was I had forgotten.

401
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:25,041
I hope your fit of aphasia
didn't include Harry Taylor.

402
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:30,755
My dear Irene, armed with nothing but
my trusty fountain pen and galley proofs,

403
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:35,009
I stalked Mr. Taylor to his lair
and bagged this.

404
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:42,433
Too bad you can't have checks
stuffed and hung above the fireplace.

405
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:45,061
Did he make any fuss?
Fuss?

406
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:47,105
He almost kissed me.

407
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:49,899
As a matter of fact,
I'm a friend of the family now.

408
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:52,443
Guess where I've been.
At the Ritz bar.

409
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:54,821
No.
Well, then I can't guess.

410
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:57,574
Dining with Taylor's niece
and her young man.

411
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:00,285
Oh, that's the people
you were with at Papa Jules's.

412
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:02,412
You mean you met the girl?
His niece?

413
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:05,331
Exactly.
Well, we are lucky.

414
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:11,296
Say, that couple of pennies that Taylor gave you
is nothing at all compared to what we can get.

415
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:22,181
Say, if he came across that easy to
keep his own name out of the papers,

416
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:25,894
what do you suppose he'd be willing
to part with for his dear little niece?

417
00:28:27,729 --> 00:28:32,942
You know, when I was getting the dope on them, I had a
feeling we were blowing into the wrong end of the horn.

418
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:34,986
Now I know it.

419
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:38,489
Here's a chance
to make a real killing.

420
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:42,869
You just give that dame the works and
see how quick her uncle will come across.

421
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:46,164
I tell you. It's money from
home. That's what it is.

422
00:28:47,206 --> 00:28:50,960
Taking money from women isn't in my
line. It never has been, and you know it.

423
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:53,630
Oh, it's not as if
you'd really hurt anybody.

424
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,174
Gee. The girl doesn't
have to know anything about it.

425
00:28:56,215 --> 00:29:00,136
You just put her in a spot where it'll look
bad for her if she gets found out, and...

426
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:03,973
her uncle will take care of the rest.
Yes. I know the mechanics of the business.

427
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:06,893
Well, maybe you don't know this:

428
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:10,146
I've got to have some money,
and I've got to have it quick.

429
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:14,984
You're a fine, great big protector
of womanhood.

430
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:17,278
Only little Irenie doesn't matter.

431
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:20,823
That isn't true.

432
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:26,996
I'm not the type to put on
a sob act, Michael.

433
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:30,917
But if I tell you I've got to have it,

434
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,838
that there's no other chance of keeping them
from sending my brother to the jug back home,

435
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,091
you'll believe me.

436
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:40,176
I've never lied to you yet, Michael.

437
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:47,892
This is the first time I've ever asked you
to break that funny little rule of yours.

438
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:55,733
Oh, it's been all over between us for a
long time, I know, but what do you say?

439
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:58,987
For me? For old time's sake.

440
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:05,868
I need the dough
like I never needed it before.

441
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,624
Irene, you know I'd do
anything I could for you...

442
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:14,877
We could all use the dough.

443
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:29,559
That's the one argument
I can never get around.

444
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,602
"We could all use the dough."

445
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:38,985
Okay. But first, last and only.

446
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:42,989
Great!
Anything you want me to do?

447
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:45,074
No. I can handle this alone.

448
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,370
Say, what's been
getting into you lately?

449
00:30:49,454 --> 00:30:51,372
I don't know.

450
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:54,417
I wish I did. Well, I'll tell
you, if you want to know.

451
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,502
You've been getting ideas.

452
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:59,255
You've been doing everything
but wearing a plume in your hat.

453
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:02,175
The first thing I know, you'll be
helping old ladies across the street.

454
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:08,014
I used to help a Mrs. Allison
across the street on account of her age.

455
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:10,016
She was old, you see.

456
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,271
You'd better snap out of it.

457
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:19,442
You've been playing Robin Hood so long,
you're beginning to believe in it yourself.

458
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:24,989
Well, if that's all that's on
your mind... Yes. That's all.

459
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:29,494
If I think of anything else,
I'll send word by special messenger.

460
00:31:32,872 --> 00:31:35,416
Come on, Fred.

461
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,252
Maybe we can find some place
where there aren't so many books.

462
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:41,714
Maybe there'll be a few
glasses in sight. I'm going home.

463
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:44,926
You're going to buy Irenie
a little nightcap before you do.

464
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,969
I know better
than to argue with you.

465
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:49,931
I wish I could say as much
for everybody in this room.

466
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:52,266
So long, Mr. Trevor.

467
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,811
See you later.

468
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:22,171
French or not French, they look
just like any other horses to me. Oh.

469
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:27,426
You mean to say that you, uh, don't find even a trace
of that je ne sais quoi for which France is so famous?

470
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,263
Not a jenny. Anyway, I didn't
come to Paris to look at horses.

471
00:32:30,346 --> 00:32:34,600
There's plenty of horses back home if I want to
look at 'em. But these are champions, Uncle Harry.

472
00:32:34,684 --> 00:32:37,562
Well, I've seen champions before.
They're no treat to me.

473
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:42,066
Say, how about going back to the bar and having
another one of those funny little green drinks?

474
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,068
Ah, yes. If you wish.

475
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:47,905
If I had my wish about this party, we'd
never have left the bar in the first place.

476
00:32:47,989 --> 00:32:50,992
The idea of spending a lovely
afternoon like this looking at horses.

477
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:53,369
But it keeps you out
in the open air, Uncle Harry.

478
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,955
Well, I had all the open air
I wanted back home.

479
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:58,916
Hello, Mr. Trevor.
Hello. How are you?

480
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:02,545
Fine. And you? Fred, you don't mean to tell
me you're showing Miss Harper the town?

481
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:07,884
Well, not exactly. There was a trainer down here in the
paddock she didn't know. So I said I'd introduce her to him.

482
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:09,886
Ah. I see. Oh, allow me.

483
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:12,388
Uh, Miss Kendall, uh, Miss
Harper. How do you do?

484
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,390
Uh, Mr. Taylor, Miss Harper.

485
00:33:14,432 --> 00:33:18,728
Miss Harper has been one of the shining ornaments of
our little colony here in Paris for several years.

486
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,897
Oh, excuse me, Fred.

487
00:33:20,938 --> 00:33:22,940
Fred is the best
American guide in Paris.

488
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:26,319
You're just the fellow I want to see.
Let me tell you something, mister.

489
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:31,657
There's a fortune waiting for any guide who don't know
anything about monuments, painting, historical edifices or...

490
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,826
A pen picture of Fred
if ever I heard one.

491
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,550
You've been doing pretty well dodging monuments
and paintings, Uncle Harry, without a guide.

492
00:33:37,622 --> 00:33:41,250
Well, as I remember the old U.S.A.,
there's plenty of monuments right there.

493
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:44,170
You're terrible, Uncle Harry.
Not terrible. Just honest.

494
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:47,381
Most of the time it's the same
thing. Well, to be perfectly honest,

495
00:33:47,465 --> 00:33:51,093
would you think it terrible if I were
to suggest a little drink? My error.

496
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:53,596
I'll join you folks later.

497
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,392
Uh, don't send out an alarm for me
until I've been lost for at least 10 days.

498
00:33:58,476 --> 00:34:00,394
Well, uh...
Ah.

499
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:03,814
Well, so long, Mr. Trevor. I got some
customers I gotta take to the Louvre.

500
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:06,609
I should think you would know
those pictures pretty well by now.

501
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:09,904
Oh, I don't look at 'em,
Mr. Trevor. I just explain 'em. Uh...

502
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:15,159
I didn't dare suggest it while
your uncle was here, but, uh,

503
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:17,161
what about seeing something
of the race?

504
00:34:17,203 --> 00:34:19,997
What an old-fashioned idea.
Let's try it.

505
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,083
Let's.

506
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:33,719
I think you can
catch it better through here.

507
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:35,972
Thank you.
See if they're set right.

508
00:34:36,973 --> 00:34:38,891
Yes.

509
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:41,852
Oh, yes. Watch that number 11.
Beautiful thing, isn't it?

510
00:34:41,936 --> 00:34:45,356
Oh, I hope he wins.

511
00:35:26,647 --> 00:35:29,066
He won! He won!

512
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,527
Who won what? The man
with the black and gold cap.

513
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:33,529
Did you bet anything on him?
No.

514
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:35,531
Then what are you getting
so excited about?

515
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:38,242
There's thousands of races
won every day some place.

516
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:41,996
I don't figure it's sensible to get excited
about horses unless you win something.

517
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,998
Why don't you give me
something so I can win?

518
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:47,168
Well, what did you do with that
money I gave you yesterday? I spent it.

519
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,214
Putting your heart
in your work, aren't you?

520
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:56,969
Now I guess we can go back to the bar
and get one of those funny-colored drinks.

521
00:35:57,053 --> 00:36:00,681
Oh, Mary can stay here with Mr. Trevor
for the next race if she wants to.

522
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:05,895
The sun hurts my eyes. I'm sure Mr. Trevor
would rather remain here, wouldn't he?

523
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:08,647
If I must answer
Yes or no, yes.

524
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:14,528
We'll be back in a couple of minutes. Oh, Mr. Trevor,
I'm afraid I'll have to renege on that opera tonight.

525
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:16,530
But that Russian's
going to conduct.

526
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:20,409
Oh, I didn't mean I didn't want you to go.
No, I really think you ought to go.

527
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:22,453
It's just that Miss Harper
here was telling me...

528
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:24,556
about a new place in Montmartre
that's opening up and I thought...

529
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,583
If Miss Harper knows of a new place
in Montmartre that's opening up,

530
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,002
I'm sure it's the kind of place
that you would like.

531
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:32,838
If Miss Kendall wouldn't mind
going to the opera with me alone,

532
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:34,923
I should be delighted to...
What do you say, Mary?

533
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,051
I don't want to go to the opera
if you don't want to.

534
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:39,261
Well, I wouldn't like
to have it generally known,

535
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:42,306
but the opera I want
to go to doesn't exist.

536
00:36:42,348 --> 00:36:44,683
Then it's settled.
Come on, Miss Harper.

537
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,937
I have a feeling we can get that fella
to make some of that orange stuff...

538
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:52,358
with some of that iced green stuff,
and turn out something really beautiful.

539
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:54,610
Good-bye, Mr. Trevor.
Good-bye.

540
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:57,113
Good-bye, Miss Kendall.
Good-bye.

541
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:06,455
I suppose I ought to feel angry
with Uncle Harry, but somehow I don't.

542
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:09,667
Angry? Why? For forcing us
to go to the opera alone?

543
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,669
That isn't what I meant.

544
00:37:11,752 --> 00:37:15,506
I mean angry for seeing
so little of what Paris really can be.

545
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:17,883
I adore it so, don't you?

546
00:37:18,008 --> 00:37:22,471
I'm not so sure but what he's seeing more of Paris
than people who've lived here all their lives.

547
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:26,517
Besides, I'm rather
indebted to him for...

548
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,894
For what?

549
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:33,357
For the opera.

550
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:42,825
I should think you'd never want to finish writing
your novel if it meant you had to leave Paris.

551
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,971
I've had a guilty feeling these last few
days that I've made you neglect your work.

552
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:48,581
Ah, on the contrary.

553
00:37:48,664 --> 00:37:52,751
As a matter of fact, I've been thinking
of changing my story entirely,

554
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,795
throwing away everything
I've written so far.

555
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:56,839
Why?

556
00:37:57,965 --> 00:38:03,304
Well, I was writing the life of a man
whom I thought I knew pretty well.

557
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:06,515
It was all very definite in my mind.

558
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,269
I didn't know exactly
what the end was to be, but...

559
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:12,605
it wasn't very hard to guess.

560
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:16,525
But now it's all different.

561
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:20,237
I may keep the same man
for my hero, but...

562
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:23,073
I think I'll change
the entire course of his life.

563
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:26,202
It all depends.

564
00:38:26,243 --> 00:38:31,248
You see, it's not entirely up to me.

565
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:33,667
But if you're writing it...

566
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:36,295
In everything we do,
whether we know it or not,

567
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:39,048
there's always a collaborator.

568
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:41,926
In this case, my hero has...

569
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:46,347
fallen in love with a girl
he's just met.

570
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,557
Funny, I'd have bet
a million dollars...

571
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,393
that he wasn't the type
to fall in love at first sight.

572
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:54,647
But he has.

573
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,608
I see.

574
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,444
It's quite a problem.
Why?

575
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,446
Don't you see?

576
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:07,201
He doesn't know whether
she cares anything for him.

577
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,411
I'm... I'm not a novelist,

578
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:11,455
but I know how to solve that.

579
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:13,916
He ought to ask her.

580
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:20,422
Perhaps.

581
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:22,508
But suppose...
Suppose what?

582
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:25,094
Suppose he's not
the man she thinks he is,

583
00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:28,514
that he seems to be
in the opening chapters.

584
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:34,186
I may have to end it
as I first planned it.

585
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,607
If she's the girl you think
you've written about, you won't.

586
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,703
It's getting late.

587
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:54,248
Don't you want
to go back to your hotel?

588
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:56,625
Do you?

589
00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:00,254
No.
Neither do I.

590
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:04,174
But I suppose we'd better.

591
00:40:06,343 --> 00:40:08,637
I suppose we'd better.

592
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,885
Well, at last.

593
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:51,513
Say, where have you
been all this time?

594
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:55,059
I've been taking a walk.
Alone?

595
00:40:55,142 --> 00:40:57,061
Not exactly.

596
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:03,108
Seems to me you've been doing a lot of
walking these last four or five nights.

597
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:07,446
It, uh, might be a good idea if you were
to take these walks on some other nights...

598
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:10,866
than when we have to get out
this beautiful little weekly of yours.

599
00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:17,706
There may not be many more nights when we have
to get out this beautiful little weekly of mine.

600
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,211
I want to talk to you.

601
00:41:22,294 --> 00:41:24,505
That's never very difficult.

602
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:28,550
Here, Fred. Now, be sure
you get these corrections right.

603
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:31,804
Let's print the corrections
first next time.

604
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:36,725
What are you driving at?

605
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:41,146
Meaning?
I wasn't born yesterday.

606
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,818
You have a gift
for unnecessary remarks.

607
00:41:45,901 --> 00:41:48,278
Never mind my gift.

608
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:52,950
All right.

609
00:41:53,033 --> 00:41:55,869
We'll never mind all your gifts.

610
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,248
To spare you the trouble
of asking a lot of questions,

611
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:02,584
I'll try to tell it to you
as compactly as I can.

612
00:42:04,628 --> 00:42:07,131
I'm through.

613
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:09,758
Through with what?

614
00:42:09,842 --> 00:42:11,802
Through with all this.

615
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:15,931
With that printing press, with everything
that's ever been printed on it, with...

616
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:20,144
With the whole works.

617
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:33,824
You've fallen for that kid.

618
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,745
I thought you had
that afternoon at the races...

619
00:42:37,828 --> 00:42:41,623
when I saw you looking at her
in that funny way.

620
00:42:41,665 --> 00:42:43,667
But I wasn't sure.

621
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:47,129
Now I know.

622
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:55,804
I suppose you think
that you're in love.

623
00:42:57,514 --> 00:43:00,434
I believe I am in love.

624
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:04,396
And I suppose
she's in love with you?

625
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,941
I think she is.
Well, then think again.

626
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,069
There's a fair chance
that she's fallen for you,

627
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:13,155
but she's not in love with you.

628
00:43:13,238 --> 00:43:16,825
You're different from anything
she's ever met before.

629
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:19,578
But she's not in love with you.

630
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:23,332
There's not a chance in the world for
a girl like that to be in love with you.

631
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,421
I suppose you neglected to tell her
who you really are and what you really do.

632
00:43:32,382 --> 00:43:34,968
That's over.

633
00:43:35,052 --> 00:43:37,387
Is it?

634
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:39,681
Suppose I were to tell her a few things.

635
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:44,019
You won't have to.

636
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:51,026
I decided to let her know
exactly what I am.

637
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:00,285
For a few minutes
you had me worried.

638
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,956
When I think of you telling
that girl the story of your life,

639
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,708
the things you've done,
the way you earn your living,

640
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,044
I'll believe anything.

641
00:44:10,587 --> 00:44:13,382
Well, if it's all the same to you,
I've got work to do.

642
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:16,218
Somebody's gotta get those papers out.

643
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:19,304
And if you're not gonna do
your share, I guess I'll have to.

644
00:44:21,265 --> 00:44:23,976
Giving me the silence cure, huh?

645
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:25,978
See if I care.

646
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,406
Aw, you'll get this silly kid out of
your system. Everything will be all right.

647
00:45:50,604 --> 00:45:54,650
Uh, Miss Mary Kendall, please.

648
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:59,404
No, Mary Kendall. Right.

649
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,299
Hello?
Hello.

650
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:23,804
Oh, hello.
This is Michael.

651
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:27,432
I'm so glad you told me.
I might never have known.

652
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:30,769
Mary, I'd like to see you.

653
00:46:30,852 --> 00:46:33,313
That makes it easier.
I would like to see you.

654
00:46:33,397 --> 00:46:36,733
Right away.
Right away.

655
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:39,987
I'll come to the hotel and
pick you up if you want, but...

656
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,197
I'd prefer to meet you
somewhere else.

657
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,241
Somewhere else it is, milord.

658
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:47,536
Well, can you be at that statue
in the Bois in an hour?

659
00:46:48,537 --> 00:46:50,914
Uh, the statue of Cupid?

660
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:55,544
Cupid. In an hour?

661
00:46:55,585 --> 00:46:58,714
You sound like a railroad schedule,
but I'll be there.

662
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:01,299
Good.

663
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,719
Bye.
Bye-bye.

664
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:34,624
Before I ask you to listen
to me, I must warn you...

665
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,419
that I'm going to do
a lot of talking about myself.

666
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:41,590
I could think of nothing
I could like better.

667
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,929
No, you're wrong.
Am I?

668
00:47:51,808 --> 00:47:54,144
You don't know anything about me...

669
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:58,523
I know everything about you. I knew
everything about you the moment I saw you.

670
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:06,073
Do you know what I do for a living?
Of course.

671
00:48:06,156 --> 00:48:10,118
You used to be a newspaperman, and
now you're over here writing for yourself.

672
00:48:12,871 --> 00:48:16,041
I used to be a newspaperman.

673
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:18,043
Until I made a fool of myself.

674
00:48:20,879 --> 00:48:23,548
And then I came over here because...

675
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:29,096
there was nothing further
open to me among decent people,

676
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:32,557
among my own people.

677
00:48:36,645 --> 00:48:40,482
Did your uncle say anything
about how we met?

678
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:46,071
Well, it doesn't matter.

679
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:48,490
I've met a lot of people that way.

680
00:48:53,912 --> 00:48:56,873
I live by my wits.

681
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:03,755
By finding out things that people don't
want to have known about themselves...

682
00:49:04,965 --> 00:49:08,009
and by getting paid to keep quiet.

683
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,429
I don't believe it.

684
00:49:13,098 --> 00:49:15,976
There was a time when
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

685
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:20,188
But that was back home, before...

686
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:25,152
Well, the details don't matter.

687
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,529
I was a sap.

688
00:49:27,612 --> 00:49:30,115
And they made me pay for it.

689
00:49:30,198 --> 00:49:34,995
So I made up my mind to make
other people pay my way from then on.

690
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,999
That's all.

691
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:41,293
Why have you told me this?

692
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:46,381
Because I felt you ought to know.

693
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:48,383
Why did you feel I ought to know?

694
00:49:49,384 --> 00:49:51,428
Because...

695
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,768
My telling you has served its purpose.

696
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:03,023
You know now what kind of man I am.

697
00:50:03,106 --> 00:50:05,942
I know now what kind
of man you were.

698
00:50:05,984 --> 00:50:09,654
What you're talking about
used to be, didn't it?

699
00:50:11,156 --> 00:50:13,491
It's part of a past...

700
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:17,412
to which I'll never return.

701
00:50:17,454 --> 00:50:19,956
Then what difference does it make?

702
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,334
You know so much more than I do.

703
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:25,086
You've seen so much more
of the world than I have.

704
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,881
And you make such a bad job
of trying to fool me, Michael.

705
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:31,676
I wasn't trying to fool you, Mary.
I wish I were.

706
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:35,138
That isn't what I mean,
you silly Michael.

707
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,974
You thought by telling me
what you used to be...

708
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:42,062
you could cure me
of my love for you.

709
00:50:44,564 --> 00:50:48,401
Mary... What you're
saying isn't important now.

710
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:51,821
It was true.
It isn't true anymore.

711
00:50:51,863 --> 00:50:56,409
I'm even almost glad
it's happened. Glad?

712
00:50:56,493 --> 00:51:00,121
I don't think I could've stood it if you
hadn't had some kind of flaw, Michael.

713
00:51:00,205 --> 00:51:03,959
It's funny, you're trying to tell me
you're not worthy of me,

714
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:07,379
when all the time...
Oh, Mary.

715
00:51:07,462 --> 00:51:11,216
Before you called this morning,
I tried to write a letter to Frank.

716
00:51:11,299 --> 00:51:15,262
He's fine, good,
everything a man should be.

717
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:17,389
And I don't love him.

718
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:19,891
Mary, do you mean
that in spite of every...

719
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:21,893
I do mean.

720
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:24,437
The past is what
it was for both of us.

721
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:26,523
We love each other.

722
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:29,901
Don't you see
that's all that matters?

723
00:51:43,748 --> 00:51:47,502
Perhaps we can find a bench
where... Where we can talk?

724
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:50,755
Where we can talk.

725
00:52:03,977 --> 00:52:08,064
Say, I can remember once
I had a good-time Charlie.

726
00:52:08,148 --> 00:52:10,900
And it was all fixed up for Michael
to walk in and ask this guy...

727
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:14,029
what he thought
he was doing with his wife.

728
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,865
Good for 5,000 bucks
this guy was too.

729
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:21,036
All right. Mike is supposed
to walk in at 4:00.

730
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,788
And sharp 7100, he shows up.

731
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:27,208
You can't imagine what
I went through those three hours.

732
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:30,295
Yes, I can.

733
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:33,173
Well, you're wrong.

734
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:36,509
Hurrah, a caller.

735
00:52:36,593 --> 00:52:38,511
Hello.
Hello.

736
00:52:38,595 --> 00:52:41,931
Hmm, it talks. Say, not wanting
to change the subject,

737
00:52:42,015 --> 00:52:46,561
but you were supposed to be here at 4:00.
I have something to say to you, Irene.

738
00:52:46,603 --> 00:52:49,356
Well, what am I supposed
to do, handsprings?

739
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:52,275
I think I'll blow along.
Don't bother, Fred.

740
00:52:52,317 --> 00:52:56,154
Anything the district attorney has got
to say to me, he can say in front of you.

741
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:59,366
Oh, uh, excuse me for using
the word "district attorney."

742
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:01,618
I forgot you're very sensitive.

743
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:04,954
I gotta go.

744
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:13,713
You don't seem to hold
your audiences somehow, Michael.

745
00:53:16,174 --> 00:53:18,551
Go ahead and get all that stuff
out of your system, Irene.

746
00:53:18,635 --> 00:53:21,262
And when you've finished,

747
00:53:21,304 --> 00:53:23,598
I want to talk to you seriously.

748
00:53:23,681 --> 00:53:25,642
Shoot.

749
00:53:26,935 --> 00:53:31,606
You know what I told you last night? You say
so many things I can't remember them all.

750
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:33,775
Try to think.

751
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:36,152
You put a sort of riddle to me...

752
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:38,822
and answered it yourself.

753
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,242
You were a bit wrong in your answer.

754
00:53:43,743 --> 00:53:46,079
Miss Kendall and 1
are going to be married.

755
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,168
On the level?

756
00:53:53,837 --> 00:53:56,339
On the level.

757
00:53:56,423 --> 00:53:59,509
And that goes in every way.

758
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,389
And that's what I came to tell you.

759
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:08,435
Thanks.

760
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:12,355
Now I'll tell you something.

761
00:54:12,397 --> 00:54:16,067
You're not going to marry
that girl, now or ever.

762
00:54:19,487 --> 00:54:22,490
Interesting, but untrue.

763
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:26,327
I've told her all about myself.

764
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:31,499
You see, interesting and true.

765
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,010
Yes, I see.

766
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:53,104
Don't bother inviting me to the wedding,
Michael, because I'll be there anyway.

767
00:54:53,188 --> 00:54:55,523
I'll bring a couple of cops
along for protection...

768
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:59,861
and to pull you in as soon as
the ceremony is performed.

769
00:54:59,903 --> 00:55:02,572
There are a lot of things the cops
in this town would like to know,

770
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,325
and I'm just the little lady
that can tell them.

771
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:09,496
I don't suppose you stopped
to think of that.

772
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:11,831
I have a notion you won't do that.

773
00:55:11,915 --> 00:55:14,542
You've been getting a lot
of funny notions lately.

774
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:17,337
And they're not healthy for you.

775
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:21,841
You are what you are and you're
never going to be able to change,

776
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:25,762
because there are a lot of people
you've done things to who won't let you.

777
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:29,390
No matter if you stayed honest
from now on until you died.

778
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:33,728
I'm just like you are,
only I ain't kidding myself.

779
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,897
I don't intend to go on as I have.

780
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:39,901
But you've got to,
whether you want to or not.

781
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,073
Let's say you're really
in love with this girl.

782
00:55:46,115 --> 00:55:48,785
What kind of love do you think it is?

783
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:53,206
Because you love her, are you gonna
take her no matter what happens to her?

784
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:59,712
I know, you love each other.
That's all that matters, isn't it?

785
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:06,803
She can spend five years, 10 years
of her life as Mrs. Convict Trevor,

786
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:10,390
or whatever one of your aliases
they get you under.

787
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:14,978
If I don't squeal,
it doesn't have to be me,

788
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:17,897
something will pop up
one of these days and get you...

789
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:21,192
and you know it.
I don't know it.

790
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:24,571
Oh, yes, you do.

791
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,952
You're too smart not to have
figured it all out for yourself.

792
00:56:57,854 --> 00:57:01,357
Why don't you take a little trip?

793
00:57:01,441 --> 00:57:03,860
She'll forget all about you in a month.

794
00:57:04,902 --> 00:57:06,863
Not that girl.

795
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:23,046
You are what you are.
Then what difference does it make?

796
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:26,358
And you're never going to be able to change.
Don't you see that's all that matters?

797
00:57:26,382 --> 00:57:30,178
Ten years of her life as
Mrs. Convict Trevor, and you know it.

798
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:32,305
Never been in love
in my life until then.

799
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:39,979
You're too smart not to have
figured it all out for yourself.

800
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:01,584
What kind of love do you think it is?

801
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:05,421
Because you love her, are you gonna
take her no matter what happens to her?

802
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:31,632
I don't believe it.

803
00:59:31,674 --> 00:59:34,343
Frankly, I don't care
whether you believe it or not.

804
00:59:34,427 --> 00:59:37,156
My only interest is in the amount
of the check you're going to give me.

805
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,140
It's preposterous.

806
00:59:39,182 --> 00:59:41,184
That's the fourth time you've said that.

807
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:43,770
Say it again, and I walk out.

808
00:59:43,853 --> 00:59:45,813
You can't be serious about this.

809
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:49,400
That first gag about holding me up
on that item about me and that blonde.

810
00:59:49,484 --> 00:59:52,153
All right, I'll believe that.
But you and Mary...

811
00:59:52,195 --> 00:59:54,864
It's down there in black and white
just like that other item.

812
00:59:54,947 --> 00:59:57,885
You can suit yourself about believing it,
but that's the way it gets printed unless...

813
00:59:57,909 --> 01:00:00,661
I ought to break
every bone in your body.

814
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:04,665
Well, in the first place,
I don't think you can.

815
01:00:04,707 --> 01:00:08,002
And in the second place, the item
gets printed whether you do or not.

816
01:00:08,044 --> 01:00:10,546
I've heard about
your kind of scoundrel,

817
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:14,717
but I really didn't believe he existed.
Now you know.

818
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:18,763
Hello.

819
01:00:21,057 --> 01:00:22,975
Michael.

820
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:31,484
Just a minute.

821
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:33,528
Why? What's the matter?

822
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:37,031
Plenty. Read this.

823
01:00:54,715 --> 01:00:56,634
I don't understand.

824
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:58,636
This rat is trying to...

825
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,306
That kind of talk will do you no good,
except to raise the price.

826
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:09,313
Price? He wants $10,000 to keep
that out of a dirty scandal sheet he runs.

827
01:01:10,523 --> 01:01:13,192
It's some kind of joke.
That's what I thought.

828
01:01:13,276 --> 01:01:16,904
You'll find out
how much of a joke it is.

829
01:01:18,573 --> 01:01:20,908
Just a moment.
According to this piece,

830
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:25,955
yesterday you and I visited a cheap
and notorious inn near Versailles.

831
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:30,084
That's right. You know
that this whole thing is a lie.

832
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:32,795
Do I? You know that yesterday,
we spent the morning...

833
01:01:32,879 --> 01:01:35,506
and most of the afternoon in the Bois.

834
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,884
You remember that, don't you?

835
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:44,932
The item speaks for itself.

836
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:48,519
If the paper is wrong,
I'm sure it will publish a retraction.

837
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:51,480
Unfortunately, however,
a retraction is seldom read...

838
01:01:51,564 --> 01:01:54,358
by all the people who read
the original statement.

839
01:01:55,693 --> 01:02:00,197
This whole thing is a lie, and you
propose to publish it, is that right?

840
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:03,659
There's one way of stopping publication.

841
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,460
May I speak to... to Mr. Trevor alone?

842
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:15,463
I prefer Mr. Taylor
to remain in the room.

843
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:21,886
I see.

844
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:25,139
You are serious about this?
Decidedly.

845
01:02:25,181 --> 01:02:27,516
If Mr. Taylor doesn't listen to reason,

846
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,102
that item will be printed
in the paper next week.

847
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:35,816
I, uh, imagine Frank
will be interested in reading it.

848
01:02:35,858 --> 01:02:39,362
I think that Frank's interests
need concern you no longer.

849
01:02:41,697 --> 01:02:45,660
I don't see what we can do,
Mary, except pay him.

850
01:02:45,701 --> 01:02:48,871
And the sooner you take care of it,
the sooner I can be on my way.

851
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:52,124
The sooner you get out of here,
the better it suits me.

852
01:03:03,302 --> 01:03:08,975
Why did you tell me about yourself
if you didn't mean what you said?

853
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:12,269
If you weren't really...

854
01:03:15,898 --> 01:03:18,192
You are a silly little girl, aren't you?

855
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:23,864
Suppose someone had seen you with me
before I had everything ready.

856
01:03:23,906 --> 01:03:28,035
They might have found out
who I was and have told you.

857
01:03:28,077 --> 01:03:30,037
So I told you myself.

858
01:03:31,372 --> 01:03:35,334
I congratulate you.
Here it is.

859
01:03:39,338 --> 01:03:43,217
Allow me. After all,
he has me to thank for it.

860
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:22,840
It'll be all right, Mary.

861
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:24,842
It'll be all right.

862
01:04:24,925 --> 01:04:28,596
You'll forget all about it
as soon as Frank gets back.

863
01:04:38,147 --> 01:04:40,649
Monsieur Trevor,
Monsieur Trevor,

864
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:44,653
Inspector Lyons from the prefecture
of police. I will be brief.

865
01:04:45,654 --> 01:04:48,449
As a result of information
supplied by a friend,

866
01:04:48,532 --> 01:04:53,913
we have today established the identity of
the editor of the American Scandal Sheet,

867
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:56,707
which has annoyed
so many of your compatriots.

868
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,503
However, the French
government has no desire...

869
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:05,132
to fill its jails with such
undesirable foreigners.

870
01:05:05,216 --> 01:05:08,719
You would be conferring
a favor upon this man...

871
01:05:08,803 --> 01:05:13,557
by letting him know that the police will
call upon him tomorrow at this time.

872
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:17,061
They would be pleased
if they were unable to arrest him...

873
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:19,063
because by that hour,

874
01:05:19,146 --> 01:05:23,859
he had left the frontiers of France
behind him for all time.

875
01:05:25,027 --> 01:05:27,363
If they do arrest him,

876
01:05:27,446 --> 01:05:29,990
it will go very hard with him.

877
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:32,409
Do you understand, Mr. Trevor?

878
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:42,878
Yes, thoroughly.

879
01:05:45,005 --> 01:05:49,176
That will be all then
until 4:00 tomorrow.

880
01:06:37,975 --> 01:06:40,102
Going away?

881
01:06:45,274 --> 01:06:47,234
Long trip?

882
01:06:50,738 --> 01:06:52,656
Yes.

883
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:57,244
Any place in particular?

884
01:06:58,746 --> 01:07:00,831
I was thinking of Cape Town.

885
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:03,375
Africa, hmm?

886
01:07:03,459 --> 01:07:05,669
They say it's very nice there.

887
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:15,012
I suppose you know that
I tipped off the little lads of the law.

888
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:18,849
So I guessed.

889
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:21,143
I've been keeping tabs on you.

890
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:24,980
You went to see her and
her uncle at their hotel today.

891
01:07:26,649 --> 01:07:29,443
I did.
I couldn't stand it any longer.

892
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:32,029
Thinking of you and her.

893
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:40,704
You were right about her.
I, uh... I convinced her you were right.

894
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,251
It wasn't very difficult.

895
01:07:45,334 --> 01:07:48,337
I just made a couple
of things clear to her.

896
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,091
You're a great guy, Michael Trevor.

897
01:07:52,174 --> 01:07:55,719
I suppose I'm the only one
in the whole world who thinks so.

898
01:07:55,844 --> 01:07:58,472
But the world's been wrong before.

899
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:01,976
So it seems.

900
01:08:03,811 --> 01:08:06,522
I wasn't going to let you
go through with holding them up,

901
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:09,066
after I found out how much
you cared for her.

902
01:08:09,149 --> 01:08:14,321
I sold those platinum bracelets of mine
yesterday and wired the money to my brother.

903
01:08:15,698 --> 01:08:18,617
You're something
of a swell guy yourself, Irene.

904
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:29,545
Michael.

905
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,341
I've never been to South Africa.

906
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:38,637
Take me with you.

907
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,147
Well, I'm taking so much
excess baggage, I...

908
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,275
suppose I might as well take you too.

909
01:09:14,548 --> 01:09:17,217
What are you thinking about, honey?

910
01:09:17,259 --> 01:09:21,096
It's a funny thing.
All my life, I've dreamed of Paris.

911
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:25,809
And now all I can think of is that it's
four days before we get back to Pittsburgh.

912
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,082
The head man on the ship says
we reach Cape Town in about 10 days.

913
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:55,089
You know, it's a funny thing.

914
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:57,925
I thought I could never
get along without Paris.

915
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:02,971
Now I'm happier with every mile
we get farther away from it.
