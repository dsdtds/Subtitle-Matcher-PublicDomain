00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:15,166
THE DEVIL'S BATTLE MOBILE

2
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,321
All Heathville loved Paul
Carraters, his kind rural doctor.

3
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:27,681
Nobody suspected that in his
home laboratory on the slope.

4
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:30,015
The hill overlooking the magnificent
Martin Heath mansion ..

5
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:33,226
The doctor found time to conduct
some secret experiments -

6
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:39,173
Strange, terrifying experiments.

7
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,967
Ah, my friend ..

8
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:54,257
Our theory of glandular stimulation ..

9
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:57,627
With the help of
electrical impulses was true!

10
00:02:57,926 --> 00:03:03,226
A couple of days ago you were
small, like your kindred.

11
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,325
And now - just look at yourself!

12
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:53,916
Hello? Says Dr. Carruthers.

13
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,456
This is Heath.

14
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:58,855
Today, Henry Morton and I are
having a small party at my house.

15
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:00,515
We want you to come.

16
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:03,795
You are very kind.
I am very grateful to you.

17
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:08,134
But I'm very busy, working on the
formula for a new after shave lotion.

18
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:11,414
Oh, doc, this is my daughter's idea.

19
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,493
She is very disappointed
if you do not come.

20
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:17,233
Refuse do not accept.
Make him come.

21
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,313
You see, there's something like
a special occasion here ..

22
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:22,972
Ready to argue - Mary is going
to announce her engagement ..

23
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:25,432
With this young shot, Don Morton.

24
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:29,091
Tell her I'll come. Bye.

25
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,631
Well, everything is arranged, he will come.

26
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,362
He will be surprised to learn
that a special occasion.

27
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,474
This is giving him this
check with a bonus.

28
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,010
Five thousand dollars ..

29
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:10,266
Good.

30
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,886
You did not forget.

31
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:19,735
You hate this strange eastern
flavor, even in a dream.

32
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:24,964
Just as I hated him before
I made you big and strong.

33
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:33,663
Now, if you find this fragrance in
the night, when you are awake ..

34
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:37,703
You will attack!

35
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:49,541
Yes, you will attack .. to kill!

36
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:55,720
The dock is delayed.
He must have been called to the patient.

37
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,640
I'll phone him ..

38
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:07,939
Roy, Tommy, do not forget ..

39
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,260
You do not have to say
anything to the doctor

40
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,372
about this check until
your father gets it.

41
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,998
And you warned those two doves?

42
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,917
Probably better to warn.

43
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:23,137
"I want to warn both of you."
"Do not say a word about the check."

44
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:24,796
While you yourself do not spoil them.

45
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,856
His father will show it to you, Mary.

46
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:29,072
Why do not you arrange a grand
opening, like for a statue?

47
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:30,556
Then we could all be there.

48
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:32,591
You know, I think it
would be better to seal

49
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,335
the check in a bottle
and run it to him.

50
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:37,415
It must have come to
you from the bottle.

51
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:41,574
"Well, that does not come."
"What a nuisance!"

52
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:44,794
He was too carried away by this new
formula and completely forgot about us.

53
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:46,619
He would forget about
the formula if he found

54
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,209
out about the check for
5 thousand dollars.

55
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,223
Why do not we go to him
and give him a check?

56
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:51,773
Oh no, I would not do that.

57
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,993
He does not like guests who
come when he experiments.

58
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:57,432
- Roy can take him a check.
- Of course, I could.

59
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,412
Should I make a speech
when I hand it over?

60
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:03,463
No, actually, the check
itself speaks for itself.

61
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,751
Yes, and says a lot.

62
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:07,531
Sonny, tell us that we are very
sorry that he could not come.

63
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,851
Of course, we understand
how busy he is.

64
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,350
Good.

65
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,169
Just a minute, Roy, now I'm free.

66
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,168
All is ready.

67
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,268
So, what can I do for you?

68
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:33,428
We are all very sorry that
you could not come today.

69
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:36,207
Yes, but, you see, I'm busy.

70
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,567
"Something important, very important."
Oh sure.

71
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,286
Mr. Morton and my father prepared
a little surprise for you.

72
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,106
Surprise?

73
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:48,686
"He's right here."
"Well, let's see what it is."

74
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,445
Five thousand dollars ..

75
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,185
What is it for?

76
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,905
Just a small sign of friendship.

77
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,904
Oh, I understand.

78
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:02,284
Bonus.

79
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:06,503
Well, that's very kind of you
from your father and Mr. Morton.

80
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:10,043
"Tomorrow I will thank them in person."
"I'll tell them, Doctor."

81
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,782
And you are not interested
in my new formula?

82
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,222
Of course, interesting, but I
did not want to seem curious.

83
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:18,322
- What is it?
- A new after shave lotion.

84
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,421
Smell it.

85
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,481
"A pretty strong smell, is not it?"
No no..

86
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:29,100
The odor will erode
shortly after use.

87
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,000
Try a few drops.

88
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,459
Now rub it in the soft
tissues of your neck.

89
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:51,218
Softens, does not it?

90
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,117
Yes..
When will it be ready for sale?

91
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:58,367
Oh, he's still in the experimental stage.

92
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:01,016
I first want to test it
on several people ..

93
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,536
And see if it works.

94
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:05,216
If you want, send me a bottle,
I will gladly test it for you.

95
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,676
Thank you.

96
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,435
Good night, doctor.

97
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,675
Goodbye, Roy ..

98
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:28,513
Nice check, is not it, doctor?

99
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:32,372
They are rich - at your expense.

100
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:38,371
You made them rich, doctor.
It was your formula!

101
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:42,151
Today they gave you five
thousand dollars ..

102
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:46,610
And wanted you to come to their
home and thanked them for it.

103
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,450
It was your money, what they gave you ..

104
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,229
As if throwing the
ball obedient dog.

105
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:17,106
You must be very grateful,
doctor, very grateful.

106
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:20,786
Thanks to you they are rich and happy.

107
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,906
And what did you get, doctor?

108
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,482
You have to work hard this night!

109
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:56,181
It's time for you to go!

110
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:37,636
But Mary, now that our families are here -
It's time to announce the engagement!

111
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:41,815
Listen, Don, I've loved you for a
long time, ever since we were kids ..

112
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,755
But I'm afraid, more like a sister.

113
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:49,154
Well, I...
I did not think it was that way ..

114
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:10,192
Something happened to Roy!

115
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,751
Roy!

116
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,911
"I'll call Dr. Carruthers!"
Faster please!

117
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,590
I can not help you.

118
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,330
"Do you want to say that he's dead?"
Yes. I'll call the coroner.

119
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,569
"Do you think this is a murder?"
I do not know.

120
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,389
I've never seen this before.

121
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,928
His jugular vein is torn.

122
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:56,066
Call Johnny Leighton to me!

123
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:05,025
Well, what have I done now?
Who wants to fire me now?

124
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,524
Nobody, for now.
But the day has just begun.

125
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,624
It came from Heathville.
Mysterious murder.

126
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:11,004
The son of the old Martin Heath.

127
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:13,664
- Who is Martin Heath?
- Who is Martin Heath?

128
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:16,023
Tell me, did you ever go
on a date with a girl?

129
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,116
With a girl? Oh yeah,
with the girl .. It

130
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,287
seems that one day I was
walking with a girl.

131
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,802
"Well, did you smell good from her?"
Yes.

132
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,442
Of course, it smelled good.
As with most girls.

133
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:28,402
This is because of the limited
series of cosmetics Martin Heath.

134
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,761
He does all this stuff that
women put on their faces,

135
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:33,137
when they do not want to wash
themselves with water and soap!

136
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,761
Ah, I understand, he's a big man, right?

137
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:36,941
Yes, and a great supplier
of advertisements.

138
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:40,020
Take the photographer and
drive to Heightsville!

139
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,000
The coroner is conducting an investigation.

140
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,339
Find who actually killed
the son of old man Heath!

141
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,999
OK, McGuinty, I'm on my way!

142
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,677
"Chief Wilkins?"
- Yeah.

143
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:05,865
I'm Johnny Leighton from
the Chicago Registrar.

144
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:06,717
Nice to meet you.

145
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,916
And this is my photographer,
Shooter McGuire.

146
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,496
"Hello, Chief."
- Hi.

147
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,296
Look, we're here about
Heath's murder,

148
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:15,716
but from the coroner's investigation
we did not get much information.

149
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:18,015
I thought - maybe you can help us?

150
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:20,815
Well, I'm always ready to
cooperate with newspapers,

151
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,875
provided that they will
cooperate with me.

152
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,434
This is the policy of my newspaper.

153
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:28,774
I'll tell you the truth - I myself
did not understand this too.

154
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:35,073
Here's something that might interest you -
it's a snapshot of the victim's wounds.

155
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:38,213
With this glass you
can see better.

156
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,062
Are there scratches on
the neck and shoulders?

157
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:45,772
Yes, but we can not
determine what they did.

158
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:51,191
For the nails are too deep, and
for the knife - too superficial.

159
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:53,571
More like claws.

160
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:56,590
The same thing was said by Dr.
Carruthers during the inquiry.

161
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,290
Wild animal?

162
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,050
Is there a circus lately?

163
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,270
No.

164
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:04,600
And there was no escape
of animals from the zoo?

165
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:05,329
No.

166
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,505
Or maybe this is one of those
African leopard people?

167
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,788
"They use steel claws."
"This is not Africa."

168
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:13,068
OK, chief, I was just trying to help.

169
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:17,887
Chief, you do not exactly hold any
clues found during the investigation?

170
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:22,257
Well, since you're going to
work with me on this case ..

171
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,557
There is a clue.
But very strange.

172
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:30,426
The pathologist said that such
wounds could have been inflicted ..

173
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,506
Claws of a large bird.

174
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:33,925
Birds?

175
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:37,145
But in the district there are no
birds large enough to attack a man.

176
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:38,505
How about an eagle?

177
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,045
"But we know that it was not a bird."
How do you know?

178
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:44,624
Because we found a few hairs on
the shoulders of Heath's cloak.

179
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:47,144
Ah, Sherche la fem!

180
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:50,263
"This is not human hair."
"And whose?"

181
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,803
Well, it may seem stupid,

182
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:56,163
but laboratory tests showed
that they belonged to a mouse.

183
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:59,802
But who and when heard about the
mouse, so big to kill a person?

184
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,602
Listen, in bats, wool
is like a mouse ..

185
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:07,441
The only bats that are found
here are no more than a sparrow.

186
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:13,080
From the wounds came a strange smell,
but he was so weak and elusive ..

187
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,110
That the police chemist
could not identify him.

188
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,130
There is already something to work on.

189
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,719
Well, the smell could be evidence,
but it's destroyed - it evaporated.

190
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:28,738
Listen, Chief, do you mind if I
make myself something up here?

191
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:31,738
Of course not, roll.
And if I can help...

192
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,098
You can.

193
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:36,027
It seems that Miss Heath was
nearest to the murder scene.

194
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:38,297
I'd like to talk to her.
Can you arrange this?

195
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:39,677
I think I can.

196
00:19:39,777 --> 00:19:41,677
Dr. Carraters refused
to talk to us.

197
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:43,592
We tried this morning
during the investigation ..

198
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,876
Do not worry about Dr.
Carruthers.

199
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:48,336
He's one of the best people in Heathville.

200
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,272
He just thought you were
interested in the tragedy of Mary,

201
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:52,855
to print a sensational article.

202
00:19:53,335 --> 00:19:54,695
I will arrange an interview.

203
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,943
Thank you, chief, I'll
be in touch with you.

204
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:57,955
Good.

205
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,014
4-8-J.

206
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:08,233
Miss Heath, do you know if
your brother had enemies?

207
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:11,693
No, everyone in the village loved Roy.

208
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,972
And what did he do in the factory?

209
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:18,132
He was the head of the research
bureau, developing new products.

210
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:20,812
And here is Dr. Carruthers.

211
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:22,711
Hello, Doctor. "Hello, Mary."

212
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,971
I walked from my lab a short
way through the garden.

213
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,131
You met Dr. Carruthers this
morning at the inquest.

214
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,091
Yes.

215
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:33,130
Mr. Leighton, I hope you will forgive
me if I seemed slightly rude.

216
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,150
But I love Mary,

217
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,649
and mindful of the test, through which
she already had to go through ..

218
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:42,449
I wanted to protect her from a too
long experience of this tragedy.

219
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:44,269
Of course, you were right.

220
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,064
Now we are working on this
matter together with the police.

221
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,868
Yes, I understand, Chief Wilkins told me.

222
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:52,348
If there is anything I can do to help,
just give me a call.

223
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,997
Thank you.
"You will not sit down?"

224
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:02,566
"Shall I serve dessert?"
No, Maxine, I myself.

225
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:05,086
You can go. "Ui, mademoiselle."

226
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:12,525
"The Sahara, Mr. McGuire?"
"Oh, no, ma'am, for nothing.

227
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,525
Actually, I do not even need tea.

228
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:17,244
If I may be absent,
I'll look around.

229
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,424
Perhaps I'll find a clue.

230
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:27,643
Mr. Leighton, how do you like the theory
of Dr. Carruthers about a wild animal?

231
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,223
Frankly, I do not think so.

232
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,662
I would not blame you for that.

233
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:36,122
I, as a scientist, consider
many things from those,

234
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,722
what a simple man could not overlook.

235
00:21:37,782 --> 00:21:39,121
For example?

236
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,401
The ragged edge of the wound,

237
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:44,481
The speed with which the
killer disappeared,

238
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,840
scratches from the claws
of a hare or beast ..

239
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,060
When an animal attacks a person -
there must be a lot of noise.

240
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,040
You heard the testimony of Miss Hit -
there were no sounds of struggle.

241
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,819
No.. Only these terrible cries.

242
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,218
All this is very mysterious,
very mysterious ..

243
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:04,758
Doctor, when you last saw Roy -

244
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,298
did he look worried,
nervous or gloomy?

245
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:11,857
No, not at all, on the contrary -
he was in a great mood.

246
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,233
Well, it's time for me to go back to the
village and start writing an article.

247
00:22:16,257 --> 00:22:17,257
With your permission..

248
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:20,536
If you find it necessary to talk
again - you can come at any time.

249
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:23,776
Tonight, if you do not mind.
I would like to stay here for a while.

250
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:25,775
- Yes, I do not mind.
- Thank you.

251
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,015
"Good-bye, Miss Heath."
Bye. "Goodbye, doctor."

252
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:35,424
"A little more chiffon, baby."
But I do not understand..

253
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:38,574
Oh, you know what I'm talking about -
a little more stockings.

254
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:43,473
- Like this? Like?
- Of course! And who would not like it?

255
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:47,073
And now - do not move.
It will take a little time ..

256
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:54,732
Got to shoot - shoot!

257
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,971
Now, Johnny, I'm just
trying to focus.

258
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:02,571
Done, and - not bad!

259
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:06,910
I'll be back in a minute, Frenchcoats,
and do not worry about these werewolves,

260
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,330
because when I'm around -
nobody will hurt you!

261
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,129
You helped Maxine
feel so calm ..

262
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,979
My big brave journalist!

263
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:23,988
In my understanding this is called -
sit back.

264
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,728
Sit here and wait for the animal
to help us write the article.

265
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,187
Just look at this moon!

266
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:33,037
And I had a date with a French jacket ..

267
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:35,946
Yes, enough to complain.
We are supposed to solve the murder!

268
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:38,926
You, the "big brave journalist".

269
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:48,265
For the first time I was invited somewhere.
And ask not to shave until I go there.

270
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:52,184
I would like to watch your reaction
when you experience lotion.

271
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:54,174
Now understand..

272
00:23:55,784 --> 00:24:00,603
I want the lotion to be perfect before
you transfer it to you for sale.

273
00:24:00,863 --> 00:24:02,263
Here ..

274
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:08,602
Slightly harsh .. But customers will
decide that they are paying for it!

275
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:13,502
Oh, how nice! Very soothing.

276
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:16,341
I do not think that you will
ever use something else.

277
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,901
Well, we do not sell goods that
we would not use ourselves.

278
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:24,360
It smells so good that it can
practically be used instead of cologne!

279
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,720
Oh, what's up, doc?
Do not like your own lotion?

280
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,139
I have a terrible dislike for perfume.

281
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:32,899
Oh, I'm sorry.

282
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,999
Nothing, Tommy.

283
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:38,838
"Good night, doc."
Goodbye, Tommy ..

284
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,192
Hey..

285
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:30,931
What is it? "Where?"

286
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,031
There, something is moving ..

287
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,210
Get out of there, whoever you are!

288
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,929
What are you doing here, Miss Heath?

289
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:50,169
I thought that you would not be harmed by
the company. Maybe we should sit down?

290
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:53,798
You know, after what
happened, you should not

291
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,868
be wandering around
the garden at night.

292
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,778
- Yes, and you, too ..
- Well, my job is this.

293
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,927
Me too. Roy was my brother.

294
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,607
Careful, in my opinion, it's Tommy!

295
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:13,786
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hello. - Hey, Tommy.

296
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:15,106
How are you, sis?

297
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:18,165
Mr. Layton wanted to sit in the
garden for a while, and I joined him.

298
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:20,051
Do not tell me that you
are waiting for this

299
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:21,665
animal, about which Dr.
Carraters spoke.

300
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:25,654
"So you do not believe that either?"
Of course not. What an absurdity.

301
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:29,064
Someone or something killed your brother.

302
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,424
And, I believe, you are practicing theory,

303
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:34,343
on which the murderer always
returns to the crime scene?

304
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,553
Maybe.

305
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:38,643
This is not for me.

306
00:26:38,803 --> 00:26:40,083
Listen to my advice, Mary -

307
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:42,562
leave these gentlemen to
guard, and go to bed yourself.

308
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,842
Personally, I'll do it.
Goodnight.

309
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:46,462
Good night, Tommy.

310
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:54,541
I do not think your brother
likes my presence here.

311
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:58,210
Do not pay attention to Tommy.
We are all terribly annoyed.

312
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,760
I know.

313
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,699
Help!

314
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,699
"Tommy!"
- Faster!

315
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,678
For help!

316
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:47,134
But I'm telling you, McGuinty -
it was a bat!

317
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:49,234
I saw how she killed Tommy Heath!

318
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,313
Listen, Johnny, I want you
and Shooter back home.

319
00:27:52,413 --> 00:27:54,013
Or I'll fire you both!

320
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:55,993
I'm not going back,
and Shooter, too.

321
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,492
He will stay here to take a
picture of this diabolical bat.

322
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:00,252
Listen, great will be the headline -

323
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:02,112
"The devil bat attacks again."

324
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:06,481
Listen, do not tell me this nonsense.

325
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:08,991
Maybe for you to send a van
with bars on the windows ..

326
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,261
And with strong guys
with straitjackets?

327
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:14,450
Listen, Joe, did I ever lie to you?

328
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,310
Many times.

329
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,990
But this time I'm not lying!

330
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,750
If it becomes known that I invented
this story about the devil's bat

331
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:23,169
I can not get a job
even in a rural weekly!

332
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,869
Print the article, Joe.
God swear, it's all true!

333
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,168
Okay, I'll type it.
But I do not believe in it,

334
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,308
until the Shooter takes a picture
of this diabolical bat in flight!

335
00:28:33,768 --> 00:28:36,328
Do not worry, he will make it.
Bye.

336
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,587
You, my friend, will take a picture
of a diabolical bat in flight.

337
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:41,767
Who am I? How?

338
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,660
Have you not noticed
that there is a

339
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,476
workshop of a stuffed
animal in the village?

340
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:48,866
You're not suggesting I go there
and stuff a stuffed bird, right?

341
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:52,025
Shooter, how could you think
what I'm offering you ..

342
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,385
To persuade the village jelly.

343
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:55,945
To make you a pretty
big bat for a picture?

344
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,505
In addition, the bat -
it's not a bird, it's an animal!

345
00:28:58,785 --> 00:29:01,044
And what did not you just say?

346
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:03,744
Where is this bird feller?

347
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,723
Ah, the manager of the cottage!

348
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:12,023
A mysterious diabolical
bat killed Thomas Heath!

349
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:15,622
Flying death strikes
another blow at Hithville.

350
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:19,542
The villagers live in fear
of the diabolical bat.

351
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:23,451
Thomas Heath fell victim to the monster.

352
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:27,221
Who will be the next victim
of the diabolical bat?

353
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,600
The villagers tremble with
terror in front of the killer.

354
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,499
Aftershave. Experimental.

355
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:57,587
The devil bat attacks again.

356
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,287
A winged monster kills a
new victim in Hatville.

357
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:22,094
That's the idea, Frenchies - you keep
the bat while I'm cooking the camera.

358
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:25,493
When I raise my hand, you
will push the bat well -

359
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,493
and she rushes, as if in flight.

360
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,753
And I'll have a great
shot for the boss, okay?

361
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,233
Ui. I'm smart, are not I?

362
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:36,572
No. But hold the bat
until I raise my hand.

363
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,508
Cher, are not you hurt?

364
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:13,267
What did it take you to
break my devil's bat?

365
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:14,647
I'll make you pay for it!

366
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,087
And I'll put you in jail until
you explain it! Come on!

367
00:31:18,227 --> 00:31:20,886
"You can not do this to me!"
"But I do, do not I?"

368
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,066
We just did a little experiment,

369
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:26,585
trying to understand how the
devil bat is committing murders.

370
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,625
I'm sure that McGuire was not
going to do anything wrong.

371
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:32,445
He's just too fanatical
in his work.

372
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:34,964
Yes, but the whole city is on ears.

373
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:38,824
And everyone with horror thinks, whether
he will become the next victim.

374
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,843
I do not need unnecessary problems,
even with an artificial bat.

375
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:46,683
You'd better go back to the hotel.
I want to talk to the chief privately.

376
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:50,462
"Can I go, Chief?"
"Yes, but be careful from now on."

377
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:56,062
Have you ever met a similar smell?

378
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:04,861
Yes! It's the same substance that was
on all the victims of the devil's bat!

379
00:32:05,101 --> 00:32:08,540
"Where did you get it?"
Found in the bathroom of Don Morton.

380
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,360
Find out where Morton got it?

381
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,499
No, I did not raise suspicion
with unnecessary questions,

382
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,159
until this piece is analyzed.

383
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,799
Do you think this has anything
to do with the murders?

384
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,478
It occurred to me, but I
could not figure out which.

385
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,258
I immediately call a police chemist.

386
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:28,537
I'm poking around, maybe I'll
find out where he's from Morton.

387
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:32,157
Perhaps, from the cosmetic factory Hit.

388
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:33,977
My people are working on a hypothesis,

389
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:36,816
that the crimes committed by an
angry employee of the factory.

390
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,796
Certainly, it is not
a coincidence that,

391
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:42,896
that all the victims were members
of the Morton and Heath families.

392
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:46,695
Yes .. It seems like a
conspiracy to destroy them all.

393
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,935
I would like the remaining
of them to leave the city ..

394
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,794
Until the crime is solved.

395
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:54,654
You're worried about Mary, are not you?

396
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:59,573
Yes, I insisted that she leave, but
she will not go without her father.

397
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,629
And he persistently wants to stay here and
help with the disclosure of the crime.

398
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,573
And worse, neither Heath nor Morton ..

399
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:06,753
Did not allow me to
send them bodyguards.

400
00:33:06,973 --> 00:33:08,868
I guess we'll have to wait
until something happens.

401
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:11,492
"Good night, Chief."
"Good night, Johnny."

402
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:22,930
Boy, I have a picture that
will dump McGuinty dead.

403
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,810
Meet the devil bat!

404
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,210
And what about this wire? It
looks like a bat on a trapeze.

405
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,289
I have not worked on it yet.

406
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,689
When I'm done with it, this
bat will look like this,

407
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:36,229
There is nothing around
her except for nothing.

408
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,528
OK, Rembrandt, you won.

409
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:45,268
Says your radio
commentator Walter King.

410
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,787
Today we are reporting from a
small village of Hittsville,

411
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,463
Where are the victims of the
supposedly devilish bat ..

412
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,847
For the last six months
there were three people.

413
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,886
You noticed, I said
"supposedly diabolical bat".

414
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:57,586
This, ladies and gentlemen, because
your correspondent is very skeptical ..

415
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,766
Refers to the possibility of the
existence of this monstrous creation.

416
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:04,365
Today I have a guest in my studio -
Professor Percival Garland Raines,

417
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,985
Perhaps the world's best
specialist in the animal world.

418
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:10,104
I'll take Professor Raines's
interview on an infernal bat.

419
00:34:10,244 --> 00:34:13,104
Our audience can draw
their own conclusions.

420
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,743
Professor Raines, first let me
ask you a direct question -

421
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:20,663
Do you believe in the existence of
a creature like a diabolical bat?

422
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,043
I do not believe.

423
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:24,043
"He's an insolent fellow!" This!

424
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:27,142
In the forgotten centuries, when
men and women lived in caves ..

425
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,662
There could be
bats of this size.

426
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,902
But not in our days, not in this century.

427
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,741
How would you comment on
the fact that Mary Heath,

428
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:37,081
two of whose brothers were
victims of the diabolical bat,

429
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:41,560
and reporter John Layton claim to
have seen this incredible creature?

430
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,989
Sometimes, under the
influence of experiences,

431
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,640
our brain can play
a joke with us.

432
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:49,099
Hey, does he mean you
saw a little bat?

433
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,459
Shut up.

434
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,315
And what about the photograph
of the devil's bat,

435
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,139
published in the newspaper of Mr.
Leighton?

436
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,418
I studied this picture under
a strong magnifying glass.

437
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,518
I declare that this is a fake.

438
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:04,597
Whoever created this strange monster -
he forgot to cut the label from silk.

439
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:07,357
From the silk used
for the left wing.

440
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:11,476
The label says "Made in Japan".

441
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:21,175
Order an urgent call to Heathville.
I want to talk to Johnny Leighton!

442
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:22,995
He lives in a hotel in Hithville.

443
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:28,414
- One attempt - who could it be?
- Yes, MwkGinty.

444
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:35,833
Come on, get out.

445
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:38,593
So you slipped me
a fake shot, huh?

446
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:40,473
You're fired, both of you!

447
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:44,912
And I'll make sure that you can not get
into any newspaper while I'm alive!

448
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:46,952
"Made in Japan"..

449
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:50,931
And tell Strelka McGuire that he will
have to take pictures in the madhouse!

450
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:53,691
Come back here both and
get your calculation!

451
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:56,751
Oh no, we will not come and
we will not get anything.

452
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,230
Well, we're fired -
but still remain here.

453
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,810
I saw this bat!

454
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,909
We stay here to catch this
mouse, and when we catch it -

455
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:08,209
I'll bring her and shove
you in the throat! Bye!

456
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:14,788
"Well, we're fired."
Yeah, again.

457
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:20,447
Now he calls to apologize.
Scare him right!

458
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:23,943
There's no point begging us to
work for you again, McGeady.

459
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,867
You fired us - so be it!

460
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:29,126
Oh, Mary ..
I thought it was someone else.

461
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:32,126
Johnny, why did you turn
such a tragedy into a joke?

462
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:34,222
Mary, I was not going to
turn anything into a joke!

463
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:35,945
I was just trying to make an article!

464
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:39,405
I suppose "making an article for you
means" publishing a fake picture".

465
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,225
This is a deliberate deception!

466
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:43,744
Now the whole district laughs!

467
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:47,584
Great job, Johnny, but, strangely
enough, I did not appreciate it.

468
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:51,463
"But I can explain this picture!"
"And do not try, Johnny."

469
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,322
"Made in Japan"..

470
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:04,782
I'll take off your living hide
and slay her to the barn door!

471
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,541
This is a chemical analysis
of that shaving lotion.

472
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,720
I see you could not identify
one of the ingredients.

473
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,620
Yes, the chemist said that perhaps it is an
element with which he is not yet familiar.

474
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,279
We will not go anywhere
until we identify him.

475
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:29,319
In this city there is only one
person who could help us.

476
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,038
Dr. Carruthers.

477
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:34,258
Yes, Carrateres could help us.

478
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,598
I found out that it was he
who created the lotion.

479
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:40,637
If you suspect Carraters -
you're barking out the wrong tree, Johnny.

480
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:43,797
He is the last person in this
city who would harm someone.

481
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:45,876
That's why everyone loves him.

482
00:37:46,216 --> 00:37:49,676
Maybe..
But here's what I've dug up.

483
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:54,775
Heath and Morton made states on the
formula of a non-soiling cream,

484
00:37:54,895 --> 00:37:56,775
developed by Dr. Carraters.

485
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,375
So what?

486
00:37:58,755 --> 00:38:02,694
All that the doctor got for this was
$ 10,000, and others made a fortune.

487
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,506
Well, everyone knows
that he chose money,

488
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:07,978
although he could become
a partner of the firm.

489
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:12,433
However, on each victim there was
this substance from his laboratory.

490
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:17,812
Johnny, maybe you're working
too hard on this thing?

491
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:20,392
Well, I just want to see
his reaction to this.

492
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:24,411
If he denies that he knows something.
Then it is somehow connected.

493
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:26,231
I think you're crazy.

494
00:38:26,351 --> 00:38:29,151
Just to show you that I'm
checking all the options -

495
00:38:29,231 --> 00:38:30,861
We'll talk to him.

496
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:35,150
Pour it into another bottle and do not say
that we would know that he created it.

497
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,630
And ask him to analyze it.

498
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,249
Doctor, I hope we did not interfere with
your work here so bursting into you?

499
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:41,909
Oh no, not at all!

500
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:44,349
I can not wait to help
solve these crimes.

501
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,308
All the victims were
my close friends.

502
00:38:47,568 --> 00:38:48,977
Here is a sample of the
substance that was on

503
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:50,384
the younger Morton and
the two sons of Heath,

504
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:51,908
When they attacked
the devil's bat.

505
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:56,567
Of course, I do not understand why
a bird should attack only people,

506
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,787
using this particular substance.

507
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:02,227
The bat is not a
bird, it's a mammal.

508
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:06,186
Whatever the case, our police chemist could
not identify one of the ingredients.

509
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:08,366
We thought - suddenly you can.

510
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:13,325
And how! I created it myself.

511
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:16,625
This is a new shaving lotion,
with which I experimented.

512
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:19,764
An ingredient that your
chemist could not identify,

513
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:22,104
I discovered many years ago in Tibet.

514
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:25,064
And why did you decide to
use it in shaving lotion?

515
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,483
Lamas used it in one of their
religious rituals as an incense.

516
00:39:30,663 --> 00:39:34,502
The smell is very pleasant and
competitors can not imitate it.

517
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,022
But why would Morton and the
two sons of Heath use it?

518
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:41,361
Oh, this is the policy of our firm -

519
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:44,241
experience any new product
before you put it on sale.

520
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:47,821
Well, that cut down our theory in the bud.

521
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,140
Yes..

522
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,250
We hoped that an unknown ingredient
might prove to be a clue.

523
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,339
This is not the bottle
I poured it into.

524
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,359
But I suppose your chemist poured
it when he did the analysis.

525
00:40:01,659 --> 00:40:02,799
Yes.

526
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,698
Can I help you with anything else?

527
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:10,178
"Tell me, did you hear Professor
Raines on the radio last night?"

528
00:40:10,298 --> 00:40:15,347
Yes, it was very interesting and exciting.

529
00:40:15,617 --> 00:40:17,553
Do you mean you believe
that the devil bat exists?

530
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:20,956
Why not? You saw her, did not you?
"Of course I did!" And Mary saw!

531
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:23,876
Then why worry about what
one scientist is saying?

532
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:27,156
Because of this one scientist I was fired.

533
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:32,015
You mean your newspaper
threw you out?

534
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:35,095
- And there is.
- What a pity..

535
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,974
So you will leave when this
mystery is not yet revealed?

536
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:44,713
I'm afraid not. I'm going to stay
here and work with the boss.

537
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:49,353
If you're going to stay here...

538
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:55,532
I would like you to experience a
new lotion and say if you like it.

539
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:58,831
"And you, too, chief."
"No, no, it's not me, Doc.

540
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:03,831
If my wife smells on me perfume -
she will start to suspect me.

541
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:06,810
Well, Mr. Leighton, I understand
that you are not married ..

542
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,030
Well, I'll test it in the
morning when I shave.

543
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,050
"I think we should go, Chief?"
"See you later, doc."

544
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,229
"For now, Dr. Carruthers."
"Good-bye, Mr. Leighton."

545
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,528
What's the matter, what's the matter?

546
00:41:29,647 --> 00:41:31,987
This smelly shaving lotion
plunged you into a dream?

547
00:41:32,107 --> 00:41:34,967
Why did you tell Dook that you
use it if you think it's stinky?

548
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:39,006
I do not know, probably, I was ashamed for
the fact that I suspected the old dock.

549
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,766
Well, I like him, I'll tell him so.

550
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:45,985
What time is it now?

551
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:48,725
"It's past midnight."
"Midnight!"

552
00:41:48,865 --> 00:41:51,785
There's no point in waiting here longer.

553
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:54,604
It must have been a
night out for the bats.

554
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:02,793
- You heard?
- Yes!

555
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:10,202
Prepare the camera!

556
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:23,421
Bend down!

557
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:33,839
You did it! Listen, Johnny ..

558
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:38,539
I'll make this bird for McGinnie,
and I'll feed him myself!

559
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:44,658
The reporter killed the diabolical bat!

560
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:49,717
The monster is shot.

561
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:56,056
The end of the mouse power of terror.

562
00:42:56,356 --> 00:43:02,356
The reporter killed a bat
looking for a victim.

563
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:08,355
Scientists are surprised
at a huge bat.

564
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:13,454
It is believed that this creature -
the last of its kind.

565
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,293
I was still skeptical when I
arrived in Heathville today,

566
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:22,313
To investigate the body of the
so-called diabolical bat.

567
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:26,992
But after I saw her personally
and carefully studied ..

568
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:31,047
I came to the conclusion
that this creature.

569
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:34,071
Relic of the species
of giant bats,

570
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:39,111
which in huge numbers existed
in the early Neolithic period.

571
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:43,580
Maybe I should explain to
some of our listeners ..

572
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,049
That the Neolithic Age is a period
commonly called the Stone Age.

573
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:56,668
Imbecil. Pompous ignoramus!

574
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:46,642
I'm sorry, McGuinty, but we and Shooter
are not interested .. in your pricing.

575
00:44:46,782 --> 00:44:50,002
- Of course, if you add twenty ..
- Thirty!

576
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:53,421
Tree dollars plus a good
bonus - we could think.

577
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:57,201
You are extortionists!
I will not allow to be robbed!

578
00:44:57,341 --> 00:45:01,740
As you wish, McGuinty, whatever you like,
but .. we have a mouse corpus delicti

579
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,500
and photos are a real bomb!

580
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,836
Of course, I have an
eyewitness account,

581
00:45:05,848 --> 00:45:08,139
which is already waiting
for two syndicates.

582
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:11,559
And do not forget - you have to pay
us for the time that we were fired!

583
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,178
That's better.

584
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:16,918
Well said, boss!
OK, we're working for you again.

585
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,194
We will finish something and in a
couple of days we will arrive.

586
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:20,558
Bye.

587
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:23,537
Sign in.

588
00:45:24,777 --> 00:45:26,777
- Hello, Johnny ..
- Mary!

589
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:32,036
Johnny .. I came to say that I
regret what I said last time.

590
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,756
You think .. I do not know how to say it ..

591
00:45:35,876 --> 00:45:36,936
Of course.

592
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:38,995
Miss Heath, do you think -

593
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:42,055
the Frenchwoman will
apologize to me if I visit her?

594
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:43,855
I'm sure!

595
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:52,546
Wonderful!

596
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:57,285
You will be even more than
your unhappy predecessor.

597
00:47:08,684 --> 00:47:11,263
You're furious, are not you?

598
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:12,743
Excellent!

599
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,803
I'm also furious.

600
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:23,122
Today I'll call Henry Morton -
and you will destroy it!

601
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,821
Henry, the lotion was even
better than I had hoped.

602
00:47:29,361 --> 00:47:30,961
I want you to experience it.

603
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,860
Leave it here, doc, I'll try
it tomorrow when I shave.

604
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,139
It smells good, does not it?

605
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,439
Yes, but is it not too strong?

606
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:49,998
No, no, evaporation will quickly bring
it to the desired level of smell.

607
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:52,278
Spread a few drops on your face ..

608
00:47:53,018 --> 00:47:55,238
I'd rather wait to shave.

609
00:47:55,378 --> 00:47:58,997
Then my skin will be more tender
and receptive to the lotion.

610
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:02,437
Well, a little bit, here ..

611
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:06,976
The skin here is always very gentle ..

612
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:12,155
I'll drop a little on your arm.

613
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:25,834
I hope you are right, and the
smell will quickly erode.

614
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:28,073
I smell all the way to heaven.

615
00:48:28,693 --> 00:48:32,053
Perhaps this will be the
secret of his success.

616
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:35,012
In this business you never
know what can happen.

617
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:39,192
Can you believe me, Henry -
you do not have to worry.

618
00:48:39,312 --> 00:48:44,951
Yes, I can believe that, doc.
All your formulas are very successful.

619
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:49,181
I looked through the company's
annual profit reports.

620
00:48:49,671 --> 00:48:53,770
The income was a million dollars.
Not bad, eh?

621
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:57,270
Do you remember where we started?

622
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:01,549
With the unfortunate ten thousand
dollars for your formula.

623
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,779
You should not have taken
all the cash, Doc.

624
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:08,908
If you decided to join us,
you would also be rich.

625
00:49:09,448 --> 00:49:14,427
Although, perhaps, you are more interesting
in your laboratory, with your experiments.

626
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:17,067
To invent something new ..

627
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:19,577
You're a dreamer, doc.

628
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:23,106
Dreamers are harmful to
have a lot of money.

629
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:28,566
Therefore, you try to pay me flattery,
telling me that I am a dreamer.

630
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:36,255
Well, I really dream ..
And you will never guess - about what.

631
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:42,124
I'm afraid you got nervous, doc.
Calm down, pull yourself together.

632
00:49:42,364 --> 00:49:44,224
You worked too hard
on your formula.

633
00:49:44,324 --> 00:49:45,763
Formula..

634
00:49:46,503 --> 00:49:50,243
For a great scientist,
it's like a child's play.

635
00:49:50,943 --> 00:49:57,682
Your brain is too weak to understand
what I achieved in the world of science!

636
00:49:58,422 --> 00:50:02,541
Doc, you've made some great
scientific discovery.

637
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:04,041
What kind?

638
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:09,000
Henry, when you learn it -
it will be too late for you.

639
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,940
Come on, Doc, come on.

640
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,140
You can not pretend that you
control the fate of a person.

641
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,449
I have already proved this three times.

642
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:30,358
I apologize.

643
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:35,537
Perhaps you are right, Henry,
about the fact that I overworked.

644
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:40,256
I think I'm a little tired.
I'll go home and rest a bit.

645
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:43,256
Of course.
Sleep will do you good.

646
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:45,116
Good night, doc.

647
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,695
Goodbye, Henry.

648
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,654
36 J

649
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:03,833
Hello? "Is that you, Martin?"

650
00:51:04,133 --> 00:51:05,553
Yes, Henry.

651
00:51:06,513 --> 00:51:09,812
I want you to ask Chief of Police
Wilkins to come to you immediately.

652
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:12,332
- It is very important!
- The boss now has me.

653
00:51:12,412 --> 00:51:14,412
Do not let him go until I come.

654
00:51:14,532 --> 00:51:16,162
And what happened?

655
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:18,851
I think I found out who
committed all these murders.

656
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:20,571
Maybe I'm wrong..

657
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:22,951
But if my suspicions are
at least half true,

658
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:26,990
then this is the most diabolical
plan ever invented by man.

659
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,330
What's the plan?

660
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:35,229
Speaking of the scattered professors -
I forgot my hat.

661
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,479
Henry, what are you talking about?

662
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:40,289
I'll tell you everything
when I come to you.

663
00:51:40,448 --> 00:51:42,868
I hope I did not interrupt
the personal conversation?

664
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:45,028
No, nothing important.

665
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:14,576
I hope Henry was right
about his suspicion.

666
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:18,296
But why did not he tell
me more on the phone?

667
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:22,535
When I began to insist on this -
he changed his tone, as if interrupted.

668
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:24,915
I'm afraid that someone could hear him.

669
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:33,734
"What is this scream?"
"Ah, just one of the nocturnal sounds."

670
00:53:33,854 --> 00:53:35,194
Help!

671
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:02,610
The partner of the devilish
bat kills Henry Morton.

672
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:08,009
The second flying monster kills
the resident of Heathville.

673
00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:17,938
The village is horrified by
the appearance of a new bat.

674
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:24,487
Henry Morton - the fourth
victim of the devil's bat.

675
00:54:26,627 --> 00:54:31,106
Horror resumes after
a new monster attack.

676
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:42,185
Mr. Heath, it became much easier for
me when you asked me to live with you

677
00:54:42,265 --> 00:54:44,505
don't kill this
new diabolical bat.

678
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,134
I'm worried about Mary.

679
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:49,324
What prompted you to think
that Mary was in danger?

680
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:50,924
Only the next ..

681
00:54:51,044 --> 00:54:52,804
I'm convinced that someone
is using this bat,

682
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:55,123
To completely destroy the
families of Hits and Mortons.

683
00:54:55,243 --> 00:54:56,939
As a scientist, I can assure you that
the thought of a man controlling a bat.

684
00:54:56,963 --> 00:55:00,443
The idea that a person
controls a bat is fantastic.

685
00:55:00,543 --> 00:55:03,762
Be that as it may, no villager
was killed or even attacked.

686
00:55:03,982 --> 00:55:07,362
You forget that Mr.
McGuire was attacked,

687
00:55:07,562 --> 00:55:09,401
and he does not belong
to any of this family.

688
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:11,701
Well, I'm already practically
a member of this family.

689
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:13,481
I'm going to marry
Miss Mary's maid.

690
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,221
Really?

691
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:17,616
Well, boys, I'll tell Maxine
to escort you to your rooms.

692
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,180
- Thank you.
- And I'll go home.

693
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,156
It's high time for me to sleep.
Good night, gentlemen.

694
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,620
"Good night, Martin."
"Good night, doc."Good night, doctor."

695
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,379
Good-bye, Mary.

696
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,419
Come again.

697
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:37,558
"Maxine?"Uwe, mademoiselle?"

698
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,717
You poured me something new
in the perfume bottle?

699
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:47,477
Oh no, mademoiselle, I
never touch your perfume.

700
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,976
Strange, I do not recognize him ..

701
00:55:50,536 --> 00:55:53,296
Probably, my father
poured, as a surprise.

702
00:55:53,456 --> 00:55:56,555
He always does this with all the new
spirits that he plans to release.

703
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:59,315
Anything else?
"No, Maxine, that's all."

704
00:55:59,415 --> 00:56:01,555
Goodnight.
"Good night, mademoiselle."

705
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:53,668
Mary, what happened?

706
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:56,488
She tried to break through the window -
Big Bat!

707
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:58,807
Oh, how awful it was!

708
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:06,186
Mary, I want you to tell me
everything that I did ..

709
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:08,186
Before this bat tried
to get inside.

710
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:12,146
Well .. first I took a
bath and combed my hair ..

711
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,685
And Maxine came to check the mosquito net.

712
00:57:15,025 --> 00:57:18,205
And the hook on the grid somehow
turned out to be uncoupled ..

713
00:57:18,365 --> 00:57:20,385
Yes? Continue, what next?

714
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:23,164
Well, then we talked about new perfume ..

715
00:57:23,284 --> 00:57:25,484
Someone poured it into the
bottles on my dressing table.

716
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:28,483
Dad, did you pour new
perfume into my vials?

717
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,133
No, I did not.

718
00:57:30,223 --> 00:57:32,023
- This?
- Yes.

719
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:34,863
Johnny, smells like ..
"Hush, wait!"

720
00:57:34,963 --> 00:57:36,922
I have a guess that
I want to test.

721
00:57:37,022 --> 00:57:38,582
But only everyone should cooperate.

722
00:57:38,642 --> 00:57:40,622
"We will do our best."
Of course!

723
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:44,261
"What phone do Carraters have?"
48 J.

724
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:50,561
Operator, connect with 48 J, please.

725
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,420
Hello, Dr. Carraters?
This is Johnny Leighton.

726
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,860
And there is.
With Mary something terrible happened.

727
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,240
You can come?

728
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:02,619
- I'm coming.
- Good.

729
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:04,839
Johnny, I'm fine, I do not need a doctor!

730
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,859
That's the point and it
came to cooperation, Mary.

731
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:08,854
You have to pretend that you
have a nervous breakdown.

732
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:10,558
Mr. Heath, you and Shooter have to help ..

733
00:58:10,598 --> 00:58:12,478
Hold Dr. Carruthers
here as long as possible.

734
00:58:12,578 --> 00:58:13,978
Where are you going, Johnny?

735
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:16,877
I'll go hunt for bats.

736
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:03,171
The devil bat tried to
penetrate this window.

737
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:06,791
She suffers from fright.
I'll give her a sedative.

738
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:09,810
"Where's Mr. Leighton?"

739
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:12,450
I guess he's in the garden,
hunting for the devil's bat.

740
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:15,510
Layton is a very brave young man.

741
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,369
Let's Miss Heath one
tablet every half hour.

742
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:20,289
"Uwe, doctor."
"It will calm her nerves."

743
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:22,829
But the doctor, maybe you'd
better stay until she calms down?

744
00:59:22,889 --> 00:59:24,588
By morning she will recover.

745
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:26,728
Hey, doc, I do not feel much myself.

746
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,568
Do you mind measuring my temperature?

747
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:31,068
You look perfectly healthy, Mr.
McGuire.

748
00:59:31,148 --> 00:59:34,907
You should look at my tongue, it
looks like a squirrel tail, look!

749
00:59:35,027 --> 00:59:37,307
Try calomel.

750
01:00:59,616 --> 01:01:01,676
Today we can have guests.

751
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:05,915
And for me it can be dangerous
if they find you here.

752
01:02:19,906 --> 01:02:24,345
"Hi, Doc, I hope I'm not interrupting?"
No, not at all.

753
01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:28,185
I heard that you went
after the devil's bat.

754
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:29,345
Successfully?

755
01:02:29,465 --> 01:02:31,904
No, but I thought
you could help me.

756
01:02:32,004 --> 01:02:36,224
I do not see how I would be mon,
but if you offer anything ..

757
01:02:36,604 --> 01:02:40,703
You could give me a little of your
mixture, this after shave lotion.

758
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:44,903
But how does this help
catch the devil bat?

759
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:50,862
I still adhere to the insane idea
that this can attract a killer.

760
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,501
I do not see what kind of
connection there can be,

761
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:56,311
but there is a bottle
of lotion on the table.

762
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,801
Thank you.

763
01:03:16,818 --> 01:03:19,688
You see, Doc, I figured something out ..

764
01:03:20,098 --> 01:03:24,037
On all four of the dead was this lotion,
when the diabolical bat attacked.

765
01:03:24,557 --> 01:03:30,357
My plan is to sit in the garden, and
when the assassin dives - I'll kill him.

766
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:34,476
Leighton, I'm afraid all these
murders have affected your mind.

767
01:03:35,976 --> 01:03:39,136
Doc, maybe you want to come
with me and become a witness?

768
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:44,595
I'm sure I'll waste my time, but
I'll be glad to see your experiment.

769
01:03:45,115 --> 01:03:48,414
Excellent. I knew that I
could count on your help.

770
01:03:53,654 --> 01:03:59,573
I tell you, Layton, to wait for the
bat to smell the lotion-stupidity.

771
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:01,913
I think I'd better go.

772
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:07,192
Sit down, doc .. Bat
today just lingers.

773
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:16,691
You are not very talkative today, doc.
What's the matter?

774
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:20,050
The weapon always makes me nervous.

775
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,450
Oh, I thought maybe you should
not sit too close to me ..

776
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,079
In case the
diabolical bat appears.

777
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:30,109
Based on your theory, the
assassin will not attack me.

778
01:04:30,529 --> 01:04:33,109
I do not have this lotion.

779
01:04:36,928 --> 01:04:39,248
Now there is, doc.
"Why did you do it?"

780
01:04:39,428 --> 01:04:42,287
To make the probability 50 to 50, doc.

781
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:47,677
Now sit down and do not try
to throw out any trick.

782
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:55,746
Is not it fun when your own
jugular vein is in danger?

783
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:57,545
Is not that so, doc?

784
01:04:57,965 --> 01:05:01,145
I .. do not understand
what you're talking about.

785
01:05:01,885 --> 01:05:03,245
Perhaps you made a mistake,

786
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:06,204
when today released this your
diabolical bat from the attic.

787
01:05:07,544 --> 01:05:11,444
Do not be afraid that the bat will kill
you. I will save you for the gallows.

788
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:18,963
Tell me, Doc, how did you
grow such a monstrous bat?

789
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:24,462
You would not understand
this scientific theory.

790
01:06:00,677 --> 01:06:02,557
Oh, chief, what are you doing here?

791
01:06:02,677 --> 01:06:06,097
Young man, do not think that
only you worked on this case.

792
01:06:06,197 --> 01:06:07,736
And you were lucky that I was here.

793
01:06:07,816 --> 01:06:09,052
Thank you.
Did you kill the devil bat?

794
01:06:09,076 --> 01:06:10,236
No, she flew away.

795
01:06:10,316 --> 01:06:12,344
Well, here's a bird that
did not fly away - and

796
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:14,479
this is the killer that
we both were looking for.

797
01:06:15,715 --> 01:06:17,235
Quick, shoot!

798
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,444
- Where's she?
- Disappeared.

799
01:06:28,674 --> 01:06:30,113
And the doctor, too.

800
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:31,953
"Did you kill the bat?"
What happened?

801
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:35,453
Doc Carraters is a murderer, and
he hides somewhere in the garden.

802
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:37,752
You return to the
house and guard Mary.

803
01:06:39,312 --> 01:06:40,572
Come on!

804
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:49,591
Doctor! Dr. Carruthers!

805
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,790
Doctor!

806
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:56,210
Is something wrong with Johnny?
Is he hurt?

807
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:59,810
He was taken to my house.
You'd better go with me.

808
01:07:15,768 --> 01:07:17,087
It was Mary!

809
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:31,026
Are you all right, Mary?

810
01:07:31,126 --> 01:07:33,425
Help Dr. Carruthers, he's over there!

811
01:07:35,645 --> 01:07:38,025
Mary, this diabolical bat
belonged to the doctor.

812
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:40,824
He created it to commit
all these murders.

813
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:46,104
Well, it's too late to help.
