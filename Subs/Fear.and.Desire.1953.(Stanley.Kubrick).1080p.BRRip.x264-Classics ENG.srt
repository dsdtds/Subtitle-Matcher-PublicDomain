1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,200
There is war in this forest.

2
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,520
Not a war that's been fought,
or one that will be,

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,520
but any war.

4
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,960
And the enemies who struggle
here do not exist,

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,480
unless we call them into being.

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,480
This forest, then,

7
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,000
and all that happens now,
is outside History.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Only the unchanging
shapes of fear

9
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,480
and doubt and death

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
are from our world.

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
These soldiers that you see

12
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:32,200
keep our language and our time,

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,880
but have no other country
than the mind.

14
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,959
Do you think they're
looking for us?

15
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,479
It's one of ours alright.

16
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,119
He can't see us.

17
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,479
But maybe they saw
a plane back there.

18
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:05,999
There isn't much left of it to see,
less it's still burning.

19
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:10,479
Even if they could spot us, there isn't
anything they could do to help us here.

20
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:15,519
Yeah.
Six miles behind the enemy lines.

21
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:19,519
- Well, that's not too far.
- Not too far?

22
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,079
In those six miles there's probably
thousand of guys

23
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,519
and every one of them was taught
to shoot at uniforms like this.

24
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:27,999
If you're so worried about that,

25
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,199
why don't you keep your voice down?

26
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:32,399
I'm not worried.

27
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,719
What's going to happen,
Lieutenant?

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,159
Somebody around who saw
our plane go down.

29
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,679
They might be looking for us
in the woods already!

30
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,679
It'd be a lot easier if ours
knew where to start.

31
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,199
It isn't very much.

32
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,199
Too bad you fellows didn't get
your rifles out of the plane.

33
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,279
Let's see what can be done.

34
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,719
Once you understand
how a mousetrap works,

35
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,198
if you're clever enough,
you can use it as a springboard.

36
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,358
Here are the front lines.

37
00:03:15,198 --> 00:03:17,518
From our position just
before we crashed,

38
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,998
we should be in this general area.

39
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:24,363
Our own lines are here

40
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,998
and we should be about here.

41
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:29,678
There's a river that runs East
of where we are now, I think.

42
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:33,878
That river cuts through the front
lines and winds up on our side.

43
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:36,598
Now, as I see it,

44
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:41,198
we could use our reconditioned
mouse trap on the river.

45
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:44,198
Is that your idea?
To go down the river?

46
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,198
Yes.

47
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,078
But how? How can we get down it?
I can't swim very well.

48
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:51,918
And Fletcher.

49
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,518
We could do it on a raft.

50
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:57,598
At night.

51
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,798
Well, we'll never make it
any other way.

52
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:04,398
It's suicide to try to walk out.

53
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:07,798
I wouldn't have the vaguest idea
of how and where to start.

54
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,958
This way we'd cruise through together
in a few hours and arrive in one piece.

55
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:18,158
- Well, by my computations...
- Your computations...

56
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:22,438
With your brilliant figuring
that got us here in the first place.

57
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:47,877
They must be somebody's pet.
It has a collar.

58
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,877
Ney, make a better watch dog.

59
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:52,477
Seems friendly enough.

60
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:58,597
We can't use a mascot
in this trip.

61
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:04,917
Hurry up! We don't have all day.

62
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,877
If no one has a better suggestion,
let's head for the river.

63
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:24,717
Some more animals
might show up.

64
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,962
It's hard.
One foot fights the other.

65
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:58,397
- Get there, before it burns in the bushes!
- I could do it alone.

66
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:01,877
- Nobody's safe here.
- Are they watching me?

67
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,396
- Getting hungry.
- What's up?

68
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,676
- They're all scared.
- How hungry...

69
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:13,156
- Who'll they look out to later?
- Oh, the cracking in my head.

70
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:17,196
- I bet he was wounded.
- I don't run for no reason.

71
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,596
What's gonna hang
from the trees tonight?

72
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:23,676
- Hurry!
- We'll die in the woods!

73
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:27,196
- Don't die here!
- They're scared.

74
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:30,676
Alright, alright.
Lead them on!

75
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:25,196
After we get past this road,
the river isn't much further.

76
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,515
Mac! Get down on the road
and take a look.

77
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:53,160
You know?
There's nothing so refreshing

78
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:55,875
as an afternoon out of doors
in enemy territory.

79
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,674
It's really too bad that the sun
doesn't burn us green instead of brown.

80
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:06,359
Camouflage!

81
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:10,474
Well, if you see some strange faces
across the way, wave to them casually

82
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:13,194
and try to look as native as possible.

83
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,074
Lieutenant!

84
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:24,714
Lieutenant! Come here.
Bring your binoculars.

85
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:29,794
- What do you want?
- I'd like you to see something.

86
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,354
Around the river bend.

87
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,634
- What?
- I can't make out exactly what it is,

88
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,514
but I think you'll be interested.

89
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,314
Come on!

90
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:45,794
Over there.
See?

91
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:49,314
Looks like some kind
of small air strip.

92
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,754
Yes, you're right.

93
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:02,314
Lots of rank around.
It looks like a General!

94
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:11,594
Sure.

95
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:20,394
A General! He is a General!

96
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,194
Let's get back and help
with the raft.

97
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,793
Mac, let's go!

98
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:47,473
All we need now is
Huckleberry Finn.

99
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:54,713
- This oughtta see us through.
- Yeah, it doesn't look bad at all.

100
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,593
Should we make sure it floats?

101
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,393
Rafts always float.

102
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:09,113
It's unfortunate that we don't have
a fine bottle to christen it with.

103
00:11:09,393 --> 00:11:11,393
We could give it a name...

104
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:21,393
He must have seen us!

105
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,793
If we stay here,
we'll get killed!

106
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:26,473
It's starting to get dark.

107
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,913
Perhaps they didn't see us.

108
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:35,193
But it's too dangerous
to wait here until we find out.

109
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:38,073
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get back?

110
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,073
Hurry up, let's go!

111
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:46,193
That plane must have landed
down that house we saw before.

112
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:47,873
What's the difference?

113
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,793
There must be something big
going on down there.

114
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,673
Maybe the General is having
a convention tonight.

115
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,712
We didn't see this on the way
to the river.

116
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,512
We've been running
in a new direction.

117
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:28,592
Whatever they're jumping,
sure smells good.

118
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,277
Like mother's own.

119
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:33,192
Those guns look even more jumpy
than the food does.

120
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,872
I've got an idea...

121
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,192
No matter what we do from here on,
we're much better off with some guns.

122
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:51,791
- You better hurry. Others maybe around.
- I'm gonna have some stew first.

123
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:56,791
Sidney,
better grab something to eat.

124
00:13:57,391 --> 00:14:00,471
It may be a long time 'till our...
next feast.

125
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,911
We better eat something.

126
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,191
How's the stew, Mac?

127
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,071
Kinda cold, but cold stews
are alright.

128
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,391
Cold stew on a blazing island.

129
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:33,151
We've just made
a perfect definition of war, Mac.

130
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:34,356
That's cocky!

131
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:38,311
A blazing island with a tempest
of gunfire around it.

132
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,111
Perhaps if we could...

133
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,070
- Somebody must have heard us.
- Grab those guns and let's get going.

134
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:02,510
- Why did you have to shoot?
- Forget it. Let's move!

135
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,550
We spend our lives
running our fingers

136
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,310
down the lists and directories,

137
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,190
looking for our real names,
our permanent addresses.

138
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,590
No man is an island?

139
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,670
Perhaps that was true
a long time ago,

140
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:33,270
before the Ice Age.

141
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,550
The glaciers have melted away
and now we're all islands,

142
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,590
parts of a world made
of islands only.

143
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,710
How long are you gonna
hang around here?

144
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,069
We're in a fine mess now!

145
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,689
I'd give anything to trade places

146
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:31,069
with that dog we chased yesterday.

147
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:36,309
Seems like whenever people
get in a hole

148
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:38,789
they get to get jealous of dogs.

149
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,469
I admit that our prospects
aren't very cheerful.

150
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:52,789
But how about going back to see
if our raft is still there?

151
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,349
Look, if we were spotted, they'll have
a trap waiting for us when we show up.

152
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:01,869
It's a chance. Trying to walk out
is as risky today as it was yesterday.

153
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,669
We'll scout around the river
and make certain.

154
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,954
Then, what? Even if we find
the raft there.

155
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:10,629
Even if none of them
is waiting for us. Then, what?

156
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:14,669
We have to sit tight until it gets dark,
and hope that we don't have a full moon.

157
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:17,949
We can sing old songs
if we get restless waiting.

158
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:23,469
What's the matter, snowcoombs?
I heard that they're cannibals.

159
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:26,377
So even if we get caught
you're pretty safe.

160
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:27,694
Leave me alone!

161
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:32,789
We may be in the woods, McClellan,
but let's try to remain civilized.

162
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:41,189
Yeah, I suppose you're right,
Lieutenant.

163
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,869
Anyway, there won't be many days
left to be civilized in.

164
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,669
If we stick around
these woods much longer.

165
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,468
- She'll see us!
- Shut up!

166
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:57,067
Don't be afraid,
we're not going to hurt you.

167
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:01,947
She's quite nice.
Don't you think so, boys?

168
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:06,467
What are we supposed to do with her now?
I've got a wife at home.

169
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:09,387
I'm afraid she's become
our uninvited guest.

170
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:12,747
I must say I've had worse guests
at better parties.

171
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:19,467
All right, Corby, all right.
Let's not forget where we are.

172
00:20:19,987 --> 00:20:24,267
"Even if we're lost in the woods
let's try to remain civilized."

173
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:27,347
Well, we can't stay here.

174
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:36,667
- Shall we leave her fish here?
- There'll be plenty.

175
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:42,947
What are you gonna do with her,
Lieutenant?

176
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,347
Give me your belt.
You too, Fletcher.

177
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:51,106
Please, don't beat her!
She's scared like we are.

178
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,071
She doesn't even talk.

179
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:56,986
Get a grip on yourself, no one's gonna
punish her. I simply wanna tie her up.

180
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,546
Now give me your belt.

181
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:01,306
Let's hurry it up.
My arm's getting tired.

182
00:21:06,426 --> 00:21:07,986
Be careful not to hurt her.

183
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:24,946
I hope she doesn't start screaming.

184
00:21:30,586 --> 00:21:32,186
She's a pretty little thing.

185
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,026
Why don't we just leave her here
and get going?

186
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,226
Don't rush me.

187
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:37,986
If we can make her understand us,

188
00:21:38,026 --> 00:21:40,546
perhaps she can tell us
whether they found the raft.

189
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:43,986
You speak Spanish?

190
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:48,986
I'll handle this, Sidney. I'm
quite sure she wasn't educated abroad.

191
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:55,386
You - see - boat?

192
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:59,666
Our - boat?

193
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,586
- Boat?
- Yes, that's it, boat.

194
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,946
You - see - boat?

195
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,666
Don't tell me
she doesn't understand you.

196
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,630
If she can't tell us anything,
let's let her go.

197
00:22:27,665 --> 00:22:31,265
Sure, so she can run down stream
to that command post and tip our hand.

198
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:34,985
You kids and your ideas!

199
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:38,655
Maybe she was going
there in the first place.

200
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,010
With the fish, you mean?

201
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:45,025
Sure. A general gets what he wants
for dinner, no matter what.

202
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:48,865
If it's fish cod or fresh strawberrys
or gold plates...

203
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,585
This is hardly the time
to become a revolutionary.

204
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:58,385
We oughtta continue to see about
the raft, but we can't let her go yet.

205
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:03,025
Why? What she'd do to us? If she could
understand she would have told you.

206
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,545
Mac already told you why.

207
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,065
Sidney, you'll stay here with
the young lady until we come back.

208
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:13,985
Here, take this.

209
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:17,865
You're gonna leave me here?

210
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,505
Yes, I told you,
to watch the girl.

211
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,585
You're gonna make me stay
and then not come back.

212
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,865
I know because of yesterday.

213
00:23:28,065 --> 00:23:30,830
Keep calm, kid!
If we're not back by night

214
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:33,185
just get in touch with
her old man about a wedding.

215
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:37,105
Maybe you can settle down in a
treehouse and raise some monkeys.

216
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:39,008
Leave him alone, Mac.

217
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:42,490
Remember you promised
to come back, Fletcher.

218
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,824
I want you to stay here
and keep an eye on her, because

219
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,544
she may prove very useful
if the raft has been discovered.

220
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:51,904
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

221
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,704
Just relax.
Don't get panicky.

222
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:00,264
See you later, Sidney.

223
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:38,784
I'm really glad they let me stay.
I'm not fooling!

224
00:24:41,584 --> 00:24:43,504
Please, don't be afraid
to like me.

225
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:50,864
That's why they let me stay.
They thought you'd like me.

226
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:59,104
The troops are gone
and I can't go home!

227
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:10,784
Don't do that! Don't move away,
it's not my fault!

228
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:18,503
I stopped them from beating you.
Don't scowl.

229
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:24,183
Watch, I'll make you laugh.
Look, I'm the General.

230
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:48,983
Hey, watch me!

231
00:25:50,543 --> 00:25:53,063
Attention, the General is here!
Attention!

232
00:25:53,543 --> 00:25:55,063
Glad to have you with us, Sir.

233
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:58,183
Quite frankly, the situation
is desperate.

234
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,503
I don't think I can
cope with it alone.

235
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:04,263
Isn't funny?
Isn't it?

236
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:08,783
Orderly, more fat fish that
the girl caught for me.

237
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:16,263
The General, I'm the General.

238
00:26:23,903 --> 00:26:25,783
You don't even smile.

239
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,383
What do you want?

240
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:32,183
Listen.

241
00:26:34,183 --> 00:26:35,463
I'm lost...

242
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:41,102
Lost...
on this terrible island.

243
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:49,982
If you have to hate me,

244
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:53,702
please, try to like me also.

245
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,982
They must have been reading
a magazine in that plane.

246
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:13,262
I wouldn't have believed.

247
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:21,582
Mac, better take a look
around the river bend.

248
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:23,342
Be careful.

249
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,582
We'll get to work
camouflaging the raft.

250
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,422
I'm a little worried about
Sidney back there with the girl.

251
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,182
I don't like the way
he's been acting.

252
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:43,862
You're not going softheaded and thinking
about taking her along with us tonight?

253
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,662
You're beginning to sound
like Sidney.

254
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:50,382
No. If she can bring
three friends, perhaps.

255
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:53,662
But as it is, she'll remain lodged
in the forest, like we were.

256
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,582
That must be the one
that almost nailed us.

257
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:14,341
There he is again. It's him!

258
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,301
A cocky little king.

259
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:21,461
And me holding binoculars
like a lady watching an opera.

260
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:25,621
Binoculars! Soon he'll
go into his palace

261
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:27,781
with all his iron lap dogs.

262
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:31,066
If only this was a rifle sight

263
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,141
and I could make the red eye
between his ears.

264
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,541
Then he'd see McClellan!

265
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,061
Girls always love stories,

266
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:49,581
but it's so hard to finish
and wait for words...

267
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:55,381
You wanna hear more?
Do you?

268
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:58,301
Alright.

269
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,581
Then the spirit in magician's
power goes back to the island

270
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:04,781
and tells Miranda
that her father's dead.

271
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,381
The spirit sings how he's dead
at the bottom of the ocean.

272
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,521
His bones are coral,
his eyes are pearls,

273
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:13,461
and Miranda, her father's dead.
Dead!

274
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:16,181
Can't you understand anything?

275
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,181
Dead!

276
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:20,061
Dead!

277
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:22,901
Dead!

278
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,701
Now d'you understand?

279
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,460
All clear?

280
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,740
Everything's alright.

281
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,980
- I'd like to talk to you about the house.
- What house?

282
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,660
That house down there.

283
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,180
The one where we saw
that General yesterday.

284
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,780
Wait around, Mac. Right now I'd
like you to go back to Sidney.

285
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,980
I didn't like the way he was
acting when we left.

286
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:15,380
I'm a little concerned.

287
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,440
- But don't you think...
- Do as I say, will you?

288
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:20,500
As soon as we're through here
we'll join you.

289
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,980
I don't want anything
to go wrong back there.

290
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,180
Here, I brought you some water.

291
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:10,659
Now you like me, don't you?

292
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:11,899
I'll get you loose.
Just a minute.

293
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:16,779
You'll put your arms around me.
I know. Wait.

294
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:21,659
I knew you'd like me.
Just a minute.

295
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:52,578
Don't run away!
Don't make me stay!

296
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:55,578
You're going to tell the General!

297
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,258
You're gonna tell him
I made fun of him!

298
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,378
Come back,
don't tell the General!

299
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:07,658
I won't let you!

300
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:32,898
Blood... Blood...

301
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:38,978
No word. It's just broken
with blood.

302
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,578
What's the matter?

303
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:04,897
Where's the girl?

304
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:07,977
Answer me!

305
00:34:09,377 --> 00:34:12,457
What have you done? Tell me
or I'll pulp you to a jelly!

306
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:16,777
She was tired.
She went to lie down.

307
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:19,777
Over there.

308
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:28,977
Don't annoy her, Mac.

309
00:34:30,497 --> 00:34:31,657
Come here.

310
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:57,577
It wasn't my fault!
The magician did it. Honest!

311
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,257
Prospero the Magician!

312
00:35:01,337 --> 00:35:04,857
First we're a bird, and then
we're an island.

313
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:10,977
Before I was a general,
and now I'm a fish!

314
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,497
Hoorah for the magicians!

315
00:35:20,377 --> 00:35:21,657
The river...

316
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,897
It's blood, Mac!

317
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,376
Cold...
Cold...

318
00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:37,056
I'm going for a swim.
Come on in, Mac!

319
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:42,256
Listen to them...
It's blood!

320
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:04,976
What happened?
Where's Sidney and the girl?

321
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:12,456
The kid must have gone
out of his head.

322
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:17,456
When I got back, he was
just laying there.

323
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:20,976
The girls is dead.

324
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:26,336
- Over there. He shot her.
- Where is he?

325
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,576
He's gone.

326
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:33,496
He yelled something about
how the magician does it.

327
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:39,856
Before he was something
and now he's a fish.

328
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:44,296
Before I could stop him
he ran away towards the river.

329
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:51,656
- He kept laughing and screaming.
- We can't do anything abut it now.

330
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,776
Let's move again.

331
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,976
I'm expecting the raft to be
the best way to wait 'til night.

332
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:05,855
I guess there's gonna be more
elbow room than I thought.

333
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,175
Yeah.

334
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:15,055
And I wanna talk to you about that
house down the river and the General.

335
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:28,295
- Kill him.
- Yeah.

336
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:30,375
No, I won't hear anymore about it.

337
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:33,455
I don't know what's gotten
into you, Mac.

338
00:37:34,255 --> 00:37:37,575
So you saw a General. So what?

339
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:41,175
Raft is all set.
In a couple of hours we'll be on it.

340
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:45,975
Raft!
Raft, raft, raft!

341
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:51,740
Can't you see any further?
A General... Why, he...?

342
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:55,495
How many times do I have to go
over this? Must I tell you again?

343
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,135
What's one of their Generals to me?

344
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:01,855
He's cheap in my rate of exchange,
but our lives aren't.

345
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,095
Your rate of exchange...

346
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,455
You make me laugh!

347
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:13,255
- If you had any guts...
- Look, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

348
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:18,455
Forget about the General for a minute.
What about the plane you saw?

349
00:38:19,095 --> 00:38:22,975
That's right!
What about that plane?

350
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,975
We've already been over this.

351
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:28,974
It looks like a two seater with
that small field built in the clear.

352
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,174
One of us can take the raft down
stream to the field when it gets dark

353
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:36,054
and start shooting to draw
the sentries from the house.

354
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:39,574
The other two can plug that guy
and get away in the plane,

355
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,174
while I keep 'em busy
from the raft.

356
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,654
- You?
- Sure, me.

357
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:49,374
They'd get you.
You'd never make it back alive.

358
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:55,094
Who else could do it the way I could?
You couldn't.

359
00:38:55,894 --> 00:38:58,894
You'd be riding home sitting down
nice and comfortable up in a cockpit

360
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,894
looking down on what's
going on. Sure.

361
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:06,174
You'll recite a few tags you picked up
and everything will be alright.

362
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:12,054
I'll just as soon make the trip
back myself, on a raft.

363
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:15,374
Do you think you have any chance
at all to get away with it alive?

364
00:39:16,174 --> 00:39:17,374
I don't know.

365
00:39:18,574 --> 00:39:19,654
Here I am.

366
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:22,494
I'm 34 years old.

367
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,454
I've never done anything
important. Nothing!

368
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:30,874
When this is over I'll fix
radios and washing machines.

369
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:34,454
- They'll see.
- Good boy, Mac. That's all.

370
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:40,094
I don't care if they
got a million Generals.

371
00:39:40,654 --> 00:39:42,654
There's one two miles from here.

372
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:46,894
If his heist is gonna keep me from
going nuts like Sidney.

373
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:51,854
Only in a different way,
I'm gonna pull up my own heist.

374
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,219
But why should we?
The raft's still there.

375
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:58,973
As soon as it gets dark, it can take
us all back tonight.

376
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:04,293
If I draw 'em down to the river,
you and Fletcher can do the job

377
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:05,853
and get away in a plane.

378
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,373
What do you say, Fletch?

379
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:12,933
Well, not that I wanna seem important.

380
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:17,253
Half the trouble in the world happens
because of what some people do,

381
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:21,093
but I think half the good things
happen that way too.

382
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,973
If we're gonna get away with it
it would sure be better.

383
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:28,373
I don't know the words to say
what I mean, but...

384
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,373
This is something for me.

385
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:41,133
Sure, I guess we could all probably
make it back on that thing, but...

386
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:44,493
When you walk and walk
through the woods and

387
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:48,493
then suddenly they dangle a General
in front of you like magic,

388
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:51,093
and you know it's only
for this once,

389
00:40:51,453 --> 00:40:55,093
you can't turn your back on 'em.
None of us asked to be here,

390
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:58,733
but we all have to gamble.
It's not as if we could refuse.

391
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,893
We had to gamble once we crashed,

392
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:03,633
a General raised the stakes
and we've been so lucky.

393
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,173
Why shouldn't we put up
a little more than we have to?

394
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:10,733
What are you living for anyway?

395
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:14,053
To make talk? Why?

396
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:16,773
Why is your life so precious?

397
00:41:17,973 --> 00:41:22,253
Why? The only reason is
to hunt for the reason.

398
00:41:23,493 --> 00:41:27,652
If I knew a decent answer to it,
I'd shout it. Probably should write...

399
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:30,492
...on walls with chalk.
- Do it for me.

400
00:41:42,452 --> 00:41:45,572
Well, we have nothing to lose
but our futures.

401
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:05,572
OK, I guess we leave you now.

402
00:42:05,852 --> 00:42:08,132
Remember, don't start for
a half an hour.

403
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,492
If the plane isn't still there,
we'll have time to get back to you.

404
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:13,572
Don't worry, it'll be there.

405
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:20,092
Good luck, Mac.
See you soon.

406
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:22,732
Try not to get your feet wet.

407
00:42:24,572 --> 00:42:27,452
- You look out for your head.
- OK, fellow.

408
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:30,452
So long.

409
00:42:31,052 --> 00:42:33,692
- Mac, I hope that sometime...
- You talk too much.

410
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:35,692
I guess we both do a little.

411
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:39,052
Sometimes, talk
is an indispensable medicine.

412
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:41,332
Yeah, but you get sicker later.

413
00:42:43,692 --> 00:42:44,972
Good luck.

414
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:49,772
I didn't really mean what
I said before about guts.

415
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:53,851
Yes, you did, but only
to bother you.

416
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:02,091
- Take it easy, fellow.
- Yeah.

417
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:24,171
The plane's still there so I guess there
is no really good excuse to go back.

418
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:25,371
I guess not.

419
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:31,851
- Can you see?
- Hold it, hold it!

420
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:34,651
Yes, there he is.

421
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:38,851
What time is it?

422
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:46,451
We have about 10 minutes
before Mac begins. Let's hurry!

423
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,451
It's better...

424
00:43:57,691 --> 00:44:02,171
It's better to roll up your life into
one night and one man and one gun.

425
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:07,491
It hurts too much to keep hurting
everyone else in every direction

426
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:11,131
and to be hurt with all
the separate hates

427
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:13,651
exploding day after day.

428
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,851
You can't help it.

429
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:19,451
A curse buzzes out of your mouth
with every word you say

430
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:24,650
and nobody alive can tell which
is which or what you mean.

431
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,090
Yeah.

432
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,170
You try door after door when
you hear voices you like behind them,

433
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,970
but the nobs come off
in your hand...

434
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,450
Go in!

435
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,215
Where did you find him?

436
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,250
One of the men did
down by the river.

437
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,690
He was very busy baying
at the moon.

438
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,690
Dear Proteus, aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

439
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,050
Staying away without leave
for two whole days.

440
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,050
- Have a drink, Captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

441
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,850
You must never, never
do that again, Proteus.

442
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:44,570
Don't you know that there are
evil spirits without bodies...

443
00:45:44,605 --> 00:45:48,650
roam the forest looking
for unsuspecting dogs like you?

444
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,969
And that when you open your jaws
to disturb the moon

445
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:55,969
they leap into your mouth
and possess you?

446
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,369
Then you could become a spy,

447
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:01,249
a murderer,

448
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:04,049
or even a traitor.

449
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:08,049
Not your dog, sir.
He knows his allegiance.

450
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:11,769
Have you been alert, Proteus?

451
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,169
Have you detected all
the distant marchings?

452
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:19,969
Has your wet nose become aware
of all the blood on the grass?

453
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,929
What else can you tell us
beside your puppy dog sadness?

454
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:32,089
Wish he could tell us where those enemy
soldiers from that wrecked plane are.

455
00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:35,649
They've been bothersome
for the last two days.

456
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:39,249
They'll soon grow tired
of starving and being hunted.

457
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:44,689
Even Proteus grows tired of it
after two days.

458
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,849
See that Lieutenant Proteus
gets something to eat.

459
00:46:48,884 --> 00:46:50,049
Yes, sir.

460
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:57,129
Nobody's gonna cry for me later
or cheer for me now.

461
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,129
Nobody else is me.

462
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:01,769
I know that.

463
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:07,089
Who else but me is buried under
the chain of everything I ever did?

464
00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:11,449
I didn't mean any of it.
It was all wrong.

465
00:47:13,169 --> 00:47:14,649
Good riddance!

466
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:21,528
Oh, what a trade,
him for me!

467
00:47:22,168 --> 00:47:24,448
What a thing to come to
at the end,

468
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:29,048
like building a bridge
or stealing the crown jewels.

469
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:31,328
Thanks, General!

470
00:47:32,328 --> 00:47:37,048
Thanks! I'll take the tombstone
if it's really mine.

471
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:51,088
Waiting...

472
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:55,448
Waiting to kill...

473
00:47:56,728 --> 00:47:58,448
Waiting to heal...

474
00:48:00,448 --> 00:48:02,368
Waiting to die...

475
00:48:06,688 --> 00:48:09,688
Awaiting in the North
with four divisions.

476
00:48:10,568 --> 00:48:14,048
One by one the men turned black

477
00:48:14,248 --> 00:48:17,968
through waiting for
the last snowflake to dissolve.

478
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:23,968
Across the valley, our enemies
blew on their cold hands

479
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:27,368
until no more breath came.

480
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:33,648
Then they were dead.
And they knew it.

481
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,368
We were so well prepared for death

482
00:48:40,568 --> 00:48:44,088
that the armistice was
a mutual disappointment.

483
00:48:56,327 --> 00:48:59,527
Now he's in his cotton house,
taking up the cartridges on his maps,

484
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,247
full of his supper.

485
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:04,487
They'll get him soon.

486
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:07,487
A duck at a shooting gallery,

487
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:11,087
and I'll be the wheeler rolling
the ducks in all the bull's eyes.

488
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:17,447
I should talk. A clay pigeon
on a slow raft.

489
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,807
Frankly, I still become uneasy

490
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:31,047
when I find myself trapped

491
00:49:31,687 --> 00:49:34,767
directing the courses
of frightened men.

492
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:37,732
I cannot quite admit
that it is I

493
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:41,047
who am creating a
slaughter in this abyss,

494
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:45,287
or that I left the road,

495
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:50,287
that I ordered this and that.

496
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:57,967
I'm trapped.
What is a prison for me?

497
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:01,087
I make a grave for others.

498
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:03,167
To your health, sir.

499
00:50:15,366 --> 00:50:17,486
It's the only way to finish up.

500
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:21,686
Alone, like the North Pole
in the middle of the night.

501
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:25,366
The river is helping me
out of my life.

502
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:28,566
Sometimes, these maps...

503
00:50:31,846 --> 00:50:34,811
Sometimes, as I look at these maps,

504
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:38,846
I wonder if my own grave
isn't being planned.

505
00:50:41,646 --> 00:50:42,966
Here...

506
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:46,086
Or here...

507
00:50:48,566 --> 00:50:49,966
Or here.

508
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:06,846
No more Sundays.
No more a thousand things.

509
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:10,286
I'm a little scared though.
Just a little...

510
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:13,566
like kissing my great grandma
when she was dying.

511
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:48,485
Come on out here,
bunch of half-witted cannibals!

512
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:35,164
I missed him, I think
he's only wounded!

513
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:39,209
We have to finish him off.

514
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:42,364
But they stopped shooting at the river.
They'll be here any minute.

515
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:03,924
I surrender!

516
00:54:15,244 --> 00:54:16,764
Come on, let's go!

517
00:54:17,644 --> 00:54:20,684
Please, please,
we don't have any time.

518
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:50,483
You going back?
Can I come?

519
00:55:51,243 --> 00:55:53,323
I won't be any bother.

520
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:55,683
Sure, kid.

521
00:55:56,563 --> 00:56:00,563
Hop on,
there plenty of room.

522
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:04,563
You look tired.

523
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:07,128
Yeah.

524
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:11,642
Thanks a lot for stopping.
There was so much noise in there...

525
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:18,962
All right, Mac. You rest.
I'll be quiet.

526
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:25,362
You know?
I lost my watch!

527
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:28,442
Mac, don't close your eyes!

528
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:34,482
The trees! They're naked!
They're naked, Mac!

529
00:57:09,162 --> 00:57:10,762
And what happened to the Sergeant?

530
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:14,682
I don't know, sir.

531
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:17,682
He might make it.

532
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:25,122
Sir, with your permission,
I'd like to go down to the river

533
00:57:25,157 --> 00:57:27,282
and watch for him
for a while.

534
00:57:27,962 --> 00:57:29,922
Yes, sir, the same goes for me.

535
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:33,162
You most certainly have
the right to it if you wish.

536
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:13,161
Do you think he'll come back?

537
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:17,561
I don't know.

538
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:22,241
I'm not sure yet whether
even we've come back.

539
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:27,441
I think we've all travelled too far
from our own private boundaries

540
00:58:27,476 --> 00:58:29,881
to be certain about
these other things anymore...

541
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,241
Or come back to ourselves.

542
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,481
Part of me is glad, but...

543
00:58:39,241 --> 00:58:40,321
Yeah.

544
00:58:42,961 --> 00:58:45,041
I'm glad in a way too.

545
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:48,641
And I feel free all of a sudden.

546
00:58:50,841 --> 00:58:53,841
But somehow I don't want
what I wanted before.

547
00:58:56,281 --> 00:59:00,561
I know it's good. There's
nothing else I can want.

548
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,080
I'm all mixed up...

549
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,880
I wish I could want
what I wanted before.

550
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,160
Is your head bugging you?

551
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,480
No, it's something else...

552
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,960
What's that?

553
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,440
I guess I'm not...
built for this.

554
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,240
Nobody ever was.
It's all a trick we perform

555
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,440
when we'd rather not die...
immediately.

556
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,240
Come on!
