2
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,023
- France!

3
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,735
July 26th, 1794!

4
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:50,652
Anarchy,

5
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,737
misery,

6
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,280
murder,

7
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,156
arson,

8
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,157
fear!

9
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,160
These are the weapons of dictatorship!

10
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:00,912
One voice is heard!

11
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,708
The screech of the guillotine!

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,961
France lies bleeding, Paris an open wound.

13
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,339
The grab for power is on!

14
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,884
Maximilian Robespierre,

15
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,430
a fanatic with touted
wig and twisted mind.

16
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,474
Saint Just,

17
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,187
connoisseur of roses and blood.

18
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,813
Fouche the politician,

19
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,485
always on both sides, never in the middle.

20
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,487
Danton the soldier,

21
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,823
savior of France.

22
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,826
Francois Barras, citizen of the republic.

23
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,955
An honest man fighting for
the life of his country.

24
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,834
Tallien, another honest man.

25
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,881
In 48 hours France will have a dictator!

26
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,508
In 48 hours!

27
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,176
Unless...

28
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,790
- It's a sad day when

29
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,167
Frenchmen have to meet on enemy soil.

30
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,878
- The Reign of Terror swept
to the borders of France.

31
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,547
All the liberties we fought
for in the revolution

32
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:34,715
are being destroyed.

33
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,384
- Who is in power now?

34
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,969
- Maximilian Robespierre.

35
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,054
He's demanding dictatorship.

36
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,764
- He's a madman.

37
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,183
France must never have a dictator.

38
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,019
- You're the only man who
could stop him, General.

39
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,064
- I'm in exile, Charles,
a political prisoner.

40
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,607
I don't dare escape from Austria.

41
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,693
My face is too well-known.

42
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,319
You'll have to take my place.

43
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,489
- Your orders, sir.

44
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,700
- I no longer give orders.

45
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,827
I'm no longer the Marquis de Lafayette.

46
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,747
A general without an army.

47
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,415
A Frenchman without a country.

48
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,460
All I can do is give you my blessing.

49
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,424
There's a man in Strasbourg
who will help you.

50
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,468
Show him this ring.

51
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,235
- Who are you?

52
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,866
From the Marquis de Lafayette.

53
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,495
You have come just in time.

54
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,829
The plans are all set.

55
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,628
- Death!

56
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,172
I demand death for the enemies of France.

57
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,842
I denounce Danton!

58
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,677
I demand death for Danton!

59
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,471
- I demand the right to be heard!

60
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,305
- Traitor!

61
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,139
- Assassin!

62
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,558
- You stand accused, guilty, condemned.

63
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,601
- Who accuses me?

64
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,686
- I, Robespierre.

65
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,521
- Dictator!

66
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,189
- Silence!

67
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,065
Your trial is over!

68
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,316
- It hasn't begun!

69
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,236
- Citizens!

70
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,280
What is your will?

71
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,827
Death!

72
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,623
- Citizens!

73
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,958
Open your eyes!

74
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,252
Tomorrow it may be you standing here,

75
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,337
accused, condemned, unheard!

76
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,927
Beware, Robespierre!

77
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,638
The blood of Danton will
choke in your throat!

78
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,142
- If you've come to beg
for your husband's life,

79
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,269
you are late.

80
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,396
- Maximilian, what has come over you?

81
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,481
Danton is your friend,
your very good friend.

82
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,358
Together you saved France!

83
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,443
Without Danton, where would you be today?

84
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,903
- I can't let personal feelings interfere.

85
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,071
The people have found him guilty.

86
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:03,905
- The people?

87
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,323
But you're the people!

88
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,449
They do what you say!

89
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,284
- Take out an appeal.

90
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,953
- Who can I appeal to?

91
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:10,829
Only you?

92
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,705
Look at me!

93
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,290
Answer me!

94
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,457
Stop playing God!

95
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,710
- God?

96
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,253
The revolution abolished God.

97
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,921
It's only the will of the people,

98
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,214
and the people have spoken.

99
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,440
That's my chair you're sitting in, Fouche.

100
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,567
- I just wanted to see how it fits.

101
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,904
- Danton liked
to sit in that chair too.

102
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,574
- And to think that he had
supper with us only last night.

103
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,869
Ah, it's amazing how fast
you lose friends these days.

104
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,413
- And you never know who's
next on the list, Fouche.

105
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,706
- It must be quite a thrill

106
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,834
making out your death list every night.

107
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,379
Well, you sent for me, here I am.

108
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,466
What's on your mind?

109
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,886
- I can't decide whether to
promote you or denounce you.

110
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,473
- Where in all Paris
would you find anybody as

111
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:16,269
disloyal, unscrupulous,
scheming, treacherous, cunning,

112
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,063
or deceitful as I?

113
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,858
Oh, you'd have to
do some tall looking, Max.

114
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,401
- Don't call me Max!

115
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,281
- You're not dictator, yet.

116
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,952
- I will be.

117
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,954
- Not without my help.

118
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,789
I know too much about you.

119
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,332
- Get out of my chair.

120
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,299
- Is that the way to talk to
your chief of secret police?

121
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,717
I'm ashamed of you, Max.

122
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,010
- Citizen Barras.

123
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,182
- I arrived just in time

124
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,101
to see Danton on his way out,

125
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,978
exactly as you planned, wasn't it?

126
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,437
- Danton was my friend, not yours.

127
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,356
Why should you feel badly about it?

128
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,233
- Because Danton was a good soldier.

129
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,734
Without him, France would've been overrun

130
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,944
by the armies of Europe.

131
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:06,778
- That was yesterday.

132
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,781
Like all good soldiers, he
outlived his usefulness.

133
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,662
Read that.

134
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,539
- What is it?

135
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,126
- It's a motion I want you to
place before the convention.

136
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,051
- Why, this would make
you dictator of France.

137
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,511
- Yes.

138
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,554
- We didn't storm the Bastille

139
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,639
to make any man dictator!

140
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,057
- I am not any man.

141
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,351
- I and my party will support no man

142
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,145
until there is an end
to this mob violence,

143
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,981
secret police and the wholesale murder.

144
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,482
- What you call mob violence

145
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,984
is the Committee of Public Safety,

146
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,236
which enjoys the confidence of the people.

147
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,238
Anyone who challenges the committee

148
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,698
is an enemy of the people.

149
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,160
Where do you belong, citizen Barras?

150
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,495
- Not in this room.

151
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,045
- I don't think you
handled that too well, Max.

152
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,716
- Barras is not a man to
be intimidated by words.

153
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,968
- He's the only man who can
recommend you for dictator

154
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,261
before the convention.

155
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,222
You can't chop his head off.

156
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,267
- No, but Barras has many devoted friends.

157
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,394
When their heads begin to fall,

158
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,481
I'll think he'll come around
to my way of thinking.

159
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,776
- There's no one in Paris who'd
dare touch any of his party.

160
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:29,694
Not even I.

161
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,072
- No, but there's a man in Strasbourg

162
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,324
who isn't afraid of anything.

163
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,992
A man named Duval.

164
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,202
- Du what?

165
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,661
- Do you know him?

166
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,205
- No, but I know his record.

167
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,583
500 executions in a single month.

168
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,377
That's almost as good as yours, Max.

169
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,254
- I've sent for Duval.

170
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,548
He arrives at the Blue Goose Inn tonight.

171
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,008
You go there and bring him to the bakery.

172
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,843
I'll meet him there.

173
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,011
- How will I know him?

174
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,555
- As one snake to another,

175
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,184
you'll smell each other out.

176
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,208
- Welcome, citizen, welcome.

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,627
- I'm Duval, public
prosecutor of Strasbourg.

178
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,758
- Will you have dinner?

179
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,218
- Just show me to my room.

180
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,063
I'm expecting an escort from Paris.

181
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,898
See that I'm not disturbed until he comes.

182
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,067
- Rest assured, citizen Duval.

183
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,530
Good night, citizen.

184
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,288
- I'm sorry, but
there is no room to be had.

185
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,915
- I've come to see citizen Duval.

186
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,124
- He left orders not to be disturbed.

187
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,334
- He'll see me!

188
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,711
Which is his room?

189
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:52,837
- Please do not make a disturbance!

190
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:53,671
Come back tomorrow!

191
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,964
- Which door?

192
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,216
Or must I awaken all of your guests?

193
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,551
- All right, first door to the left.

194
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,563
- Who's there?

195
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,232
- A messenger from Paris.

196
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:26,913
- Don't move.

197
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,711
What's the message?

198
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,839
- It's so dark in here.

199
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:37,674
- I can hear in the dark.

200
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,217
Speak.

201
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,094
- It's a written message.

202
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,095
I need light.

203
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,472
- There's a candle on the bureau.

204
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,058
- Light it for me.

205
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,309
- Just

206
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,895
hand me the message and you can go.

207
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,814
- I was told to wait for an answer.

208
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:54,941
Please light the candle.

209
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,734
- Why are you so anxious
for a lightened room?

210
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,236
Don't you recognize the voice of Duval?

211
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,698
- I've never met you
before, citizen Duval.

212
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,866
- Well if you don't know me,
what good will a light do?

213
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,327
Or are you afraid I might not be Duval?

214
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,288
- Who else could you be?

215
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,623
- That depends on who sent the message.

216
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,544
- Only two men in Paris can
send messages beyond the border.

217
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,630
Robespierre and Barras.

218
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,508
- Which one sent you?

219
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,554
- That's a dangerous question
to answer in the dark.

220
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,681
- One of us has to make the first move.

221
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,184
- Courtesy demands you speak first.

222
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,525
- Barras.

223
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,194
- Thank heaven.

224
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,448
What happened to the real Duval?

225
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:48,911
- He's dead.

226
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,206
- What did you do with the body?

227
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,499
- My men were waiting below.

228
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,417
Quick, what's the message?

229
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,003
Robespierre's men will come
to pick me up at any minute.

230
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,047
- Barras wants you to
report to Robespierre,

231
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,423
gain his confidence,

232
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:03,468
even if you must betray some
of us to keep his confidence.

233
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,635
A few lives won't matter,

234
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,680
but Robespierre must
never become dictator.

235
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,182
- How can I prevent that?

236
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,142
- You'll get further orders from Paris.

237
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:11,976
- From whom?

238
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:12,977
- From me.

239
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,897
- Well, if we're to recognize each other,

240
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,024
I suppose we might as well have a look.

241
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,829
- Charles!

242
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,338
- You're looking very well, Madelon.

243
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,221
I had no idea such prosperity
went with the revolution.

244
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,309
- You don't seem to have
suffered much either.

245
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,186
- What did you expect me
to do when you walked out,

246
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,104
stop breathing?

247
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:56,938
- I couldn't explain to you the—

248
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,065
- You can explain now.

249
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,734
We'll have a bottle of
wine over old times.

250
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,111
Perhaps I can get the innkeeper to come up

251
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,821
and play the violin.

252
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,198
Explanations always
sound better with music.

253
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,993
- I don't blame you for hating me.

254
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,372
- I don't like to deprive you
of that satisfaction, Madelon.

255
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,416
I don't hate you.

256
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,042
I just don't care anymore.

257
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,962
- I'll be at the Cafe Velavinted.

258
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,756
After seeing Robespierre,
please come there Charles.

259
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,757
Please.

260
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,719
- Seems I remember an appointment
we had four years ago.

261
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,138
Only one of us showed up.

262
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,598
The stupid one.

263
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,269
Well Charles has grown
up to be a smart boy now.

264
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,772
- I'll be waiting.

265
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,650
- I wouldn't count the minutes.

266
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:56,706
- Who's that?

267
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,458
- She came to see citizen Duval.

268
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,751
- Hm.

269
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,794
Interesting.

270
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,763
- Citizen Duval, your escort has...

271
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,267
- What's the matter with you?

272
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,810
- You look so different, citizen Duval.

273
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,402
- Different?

274
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,948
Why should the appearance
of a public prosecutor

275
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,075
interest you so much, citizen?

276
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,369
You haven't by chance a guilty conscience?

277
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,829
- No no, citizen prosecutor.

278
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:37,830
I'm a patriot!

279
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,125
It was the wig, yes of course, the wig!

280
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,423
- So.

281
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,220
You're the terror of Strasbourg.

282
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,101
- I'd recognize you
anywhere, citizen Fouche.

283
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,604
- You had a visitor, I see.

284
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,023
- All work and no play?

285
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,151
- I thought you enjoyed your work.

286
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,320
- The uh, real pleasure of my work

287
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,947
went outwith the guillotine.

288
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,700
It's all over too fast now.

289
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,828
Even hanging.

290
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,916
That lasts but a few moments.

291
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,501
No, citizen Fouche.

292
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,256
What this country needs
is an elegant, slow death.

293
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,466
Give a man four hours to die.

294
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,634
It's worth watching.

295
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,307
- Let's try it sometime, shall we?

296
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,602
Anyone in particular?

297
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,232
Robespierre has a beautiful long list.

298
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,361
We're gonna have some great
times together, eh Duval?

299
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,280
- Yes, I can hardly wait.

300
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,078
- Duval,

301
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,999
you don't know me and I don't know you.

302
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,792
- That's a good start.

303
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,379
- We, uh, might be able to
do each other some good.

304
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,173
What do you think?

305
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,302
- You haven't said anything yet.

306
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,264
- Suppose you tell me why
Robespierre sent for you.

307
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,434
- I was just going to ask you that.

308
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,978
- Come, Duval.

309
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,355
You can trust me.

310
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,567
- Can I?

311
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,695
- No

312
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,350
One thing about Paris, never dull.

313
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,185
- Dull?

314
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:12,818
What is this?

315
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,321
- Robespierre's headquarters.

316
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,322
- A bakery?

317
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,451
- He loves hot biscuits in the morning.

318
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,226
- Welcome to Paris, citizen Duval.

319
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,936
- It's a pleasure.

320
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:29,812
- I never shake hands.

321
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:30,896
It's unsanitary.

322
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,190
- Your barber?

323
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,442
- Mm.

324
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,152
Ask him again where it is.

325
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:37,862
- Where is it?

326
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,172
- Why don't you eat your bun?

327
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,468
Good, mm?

328
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,720
- Delicious.

329
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,056
- Remove the body.

330
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,938
The people of Paris are becoming
more stubborn every day.

331
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,274
- We have the same trouble in Strasbourg.

332
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,526
- I congratulate you on your record there.

333
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,821
- It was becoming monotonous.

334
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,242
- We'll do our very best to
make it exciting for you here.

335
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,704
- Fouche, why don't you take a walk?

336
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,332
- The streets aren't safe
this hour of the night.

337
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,376
Oh Well.

338
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,508
- I expected an older man.

339
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,761
- So did I.

340
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,057
- I'm the eldest of our group.

341
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,476
This past May I was 36.

342
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,437
Fouche's 35 and

343
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,733
Danton would've been 34 had he lived.

344
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,111
How old are you?

345
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,990
- I, uh, hope to reach your age anyway.

346
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,575
However, age makes men tolerant

347
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,579
and, uh, these are no times for tolerance.

348
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,957
- We're living in a
perpetual state of violence.

349
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,834
The people have become
a blood-thirsting mob

350
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,752
that thrives on human lives.

351
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,589
Each day this monster
must drink its quota.

352
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,134
There's only one man who
can control this beast

353
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,762
and that man must be dictator of France.

354
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,556
- What's there to stop you?

355
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,140
- A black book.

356
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,851
- A black book?

357
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,435
- My secret file.

358
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,563
In it a list of the names
of all the enemies of France

359
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,773
and the proof of their crimes.

360
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:38,649
It's in this book that I select

361
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,568
the daily quota for the guillotine.

362
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,863
Yesterday this book disappeared.

363
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,866
- Well uh, why not make up another one?

364
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,993
- You don't understand.

365
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,705
Some of the names are men
who work on my own committee.

366
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,748
They suspect, yet nobody knows for sure,

367
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,876
whether his name's on the list.

368
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,004
It's this fear which gives
me control of the convention.

369
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,799
Once they know they're on the
list, they'll all join forces.

370
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,385
I can hold them one by
one, but not as a group.

371
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,430
That's why it's imperative
that I get this black book back

372
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,265
before its contents become known.

373
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,184
That's the real reason why I sent for you.

374
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,769
Nobody knows about it but you.

375
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,980
- Whom do you suspect of taking it?

376
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,776
- I know of only one man
who, if he had the book,

377
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,112
would have the courage
to use it against me.

378
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,408
Barras, one of the leaders
of the opposition party.

379
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,286
- I'd, uh, like to meet this Barras.

380
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,246
- Well it won't be easy.

381
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,874
He's gone into hiding
until the convention meets.

382
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,251
You'll act a special agent

383
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,337
for the Committee of Public Safety.

384
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,423
Here's your authority for power
over all police personnel.

385
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:48,010
- Fouche too?

386
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,178
- Over everyone.

387
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,972
Except me.

388
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,515
You have 24 hours.

389
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,017
- Not much time.

390
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,810
- Convention meets day after tomorrow.

391
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,313
We must have the book back by then.

392
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,356
- And if I fail?

393
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,400
- As you said, Duval,

394
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,361
these are no times for tolerance.

395
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,030
I don't tolerate failures.

396
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:20,668
- Well.

397
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,087
Where we do we start?

398
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,463
- Start what?

399
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,297
- Whatever it is.

400
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,299
Aren't we going to work together?

401
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,802
- I think tonight calls for a one-man job.

402
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,553
- Well I'm the man.

403
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,431
- Yes, but she might not like the idea.

404
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,433
- Can't your diversions wait?

405
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:41,605
- You see, I may
only be in Paris 24 hours.

406
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
All right, driver.

407
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,458
- Wait around the corner.

408
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,183
- All by yourself, citizen?

409
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,687
- Madelon is expecting me.

410
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,276
- Sit down.

411
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,402
Sit down.

412
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,876
- Nice evening, gentlemen.

413
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,257
- You wish to see Madelon?

414
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,093
- She told me to meet her here.

415
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,972
- Who are you?

416
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,391
- A friend of Madelon.

417
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,726
- So was I once.

418
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,230
- Here she comes.

419
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,783
- You wanted to see me?

420
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,330
- I asked to see Madelon.

421
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,748
- I am Madelon.

422
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:29,379
- At uh, another time,

423
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,214
in another place,

424
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,549
I might accept you as Madelon.

425
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,096
- That will be all, Evelyn.

426
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,849
- He's nice.

427
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,020
- I haven't got all night, citizen.

428
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,063
- Don't just sit.

429
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,024
Order something.

430
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,169
- If it isn't the terror of Strasbourg.

431
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,381
- I don't think we were introduced.

432
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,591
- Saint Just is the name.

433
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,552
The shadow of Robespierre.

434
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,513
Wherever he goes, I go.

435
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,515
Except here.

436
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,476
He doesn't like women.

437
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,187
Come on, join my party.

438
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,314
- Some other time, Saint Just.

439
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,774
- You don't like women either?

440
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,776
- I'm a little tired tonight.

441
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,154
- No one goes to bed in Paris.

442
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,780
It isn't safe to go to bed.

443
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,744
I've had so many friends,
all killed in bed.

444
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,371
Fouche's secret police.

445
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,832
- Thanks for warning me.

446
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,669
- I have a friend in Strasbourg,

447
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,588
Henry Duponte.

448
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,839
No doubt you know him.

449
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:56,925
- I uh, can't say that I do.

450
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,261
- Good.

451
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,305
He doesn't live in Strasbourg.

452
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,351
- That's very amusing.

453
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:11,940
- You know something?

454
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,860
I don't think you are Duval.

455
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,237
- No?

456
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,031
- You don't look like a butcher.

457
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,578
- On first glance one could almost

458
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,747
mistake you for a human being.

459
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,081
- Saint Just!

460
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,499
We missed you!

461
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,879
- You see, I am a human being.

462
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,858
- This way.

463
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,162
You choose your friends unwisely.

464
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,748
Saint Just is an enemy.

465
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,626
Who sent you?

466
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,253
- Shall we finish him?

467
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,254
- Not here.

468
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,890
- Thanks for a most cordial reception.

469
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,726
- My friends are sometimes too impersonal.

470
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,771
Come on up, Charles.

471
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:48,954
- Close the door, Charles.

472
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,211
Come over here, Charles.

473
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,345
Closer.

474
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,977
Closer.

475
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,992
- Just one kiss and four
years are wiped out.

476
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,911
Life's not that simple, Madelon.

477
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,413
Not even for you.

478
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,622
- Go on.

479
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,666
Pour out your bitterness.

480
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,293
- I drank it up

481
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,086
in buckets of sweet wine.

482
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:44,634
- Tell me about the women
that went with the wine.

483
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,345
- They were all called Madelon.

484
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,764
They had your eyes, your

485
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,058
mouth.

486
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,311
And the same false smile.

487
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,105
- Tell me more.

488
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,441
Make me jealous.

489
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,778
- They even kissed like you,

490
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,946
with soft, warm lips.

491
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,034
- Like this?

492
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:16,917
- Exactly.

493
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,506
- You are a stranger, Charles.

494
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,343
We really don't know each other anymore.

495
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,929
- But I have no intention of
renewing the acquaintance.

496
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,140
- Then why did you come here tonight?

497
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,183
- To find Barras.

498
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,061
Unfortunately, you're my only contact.

499
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,563
- Why should you want to help him?

500
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,023
- Because I'm a Frenchman.

501
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,401
And there's only one
man who can save France

502
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,861
and put an end to this terror.

503
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:45,779
Barras.

504
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,781
- I wish I were that confident.

505
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,287
I trust this man, Madelon.

506
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,459
Even though he doesn't
have the usual reaction

507
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,378
to your charm.

508
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,550
Have you met with Robespierre?

509
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:07,884
- I just left him.

510
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,469
- Were you followed?

511
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,055
- I'm sure I was, but
there was no time to lose.

512
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,099
Day after tomorrow he's
going to ask the convention

513
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,600
to appoint him dictator.

514
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,978
- Robespierre must never become dictator.

515
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,440
- Ever hear of the black book?

516
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,816
- The death list.

517
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,568
- Well the book's gone.

518
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,112
- Who has it?

519
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,031
- Well I was hoping it was you.

520
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,119
- If only I did have it.

521
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,289
I could put the entire convention
into a frenzy against him.

522
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,251
- It's the secret police!

523
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,252
They've got the cafe surrounded!

524
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,421
- You'll have to go this way!

525
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:45,422
Hurry!

526
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:46,965
Quick!

527
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,138
- Just one more kiss and
I'd have melted.

528
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,731
- Citizen Barras, you're under arrest.

529
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,191
- He's my prisoner.

530
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,150
- Was.

531
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,067
- Is.

532
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,987
- I'm afraid you're a
little confused, Duval.

533
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,530
I'm the chief of police.

534
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,533
- You were chief of police.

535
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,621
My authorization from Robespierre.

536
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,502
Now if you'll be so kind as to leave.

537
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,076
- Good work, Duval.

538
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,374
I was afraid Fouche was
going to outsmart you.

539
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,750
Come in, Barras.

540
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,967
You've had a strenuous day, Duval.

541
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,011
I'll see that our friend
gets to prison safely.

542
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,179
Good night.

543
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,785
- Upstairs.

544
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,218
- Madelon—
- Shut up!

545
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,344
Your friend delivered Barras

546
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:57,554
right into the hands of Saint Just.

547
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:58,972
- That wasn't part of my plan.

548
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,724
- I saw it with my own eyes.

549
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,267
- What are you waiting for, Tellian?

550
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,935
Shoot him.

551
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,437
- Which side are you on?

552
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,650
- Well, it looks like I'm in the middle.

553
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,610
But if you give me a chance

554
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,529
I might be able to save Barras.

555
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,739
- We're wasting time.

556
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,074
- For heaven's sakes, Madelon,

557
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,117
can't you see I'm not lying?

558
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,410
- Frankly, no.

559
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,706
- Just because I refused a
kiss, you'd have me killed.

560
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,750
Since when have you put
such a price on your kisses?

561
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:27,584
- Shoot him!

562
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,086
- You know I'm not Duval, so does she!

563
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,504
Give me a chance to free Barras.

564
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,547
- There are only three men in our party

565
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,091
who could possibly have the book.

566
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,760
You know who they are.

567
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,054
- If he's lying
we can get rid of him later.

568
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,348
It's worth the risk.

569
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:56,571
- Lambert.

570
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,993
- Exciting enough for you, citizen Duval?

571
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,707
You've seen Castel and
Bernard and now Lambert.

572
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,419
Somebody got here first.

573
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,380
- Then you know about—

574
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,840
- The black book, mm-hm.

575
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,509
Nobody keeps secrets from me.

576
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,137
- Nothing has been disturbed
in any of the rooms.

577
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,557
- Your, uh, companion has good eyes.

578
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,144
No one of these men
ever had the black book.

579
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,771
- Then why were they silenced?

580
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,440
- Only Robespierre can answer that.

581
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,068
- Or perhaps you, citizen Fouche.

582
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,152
- Who?

583
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,237
Me'?

584
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:59,592
- Well, much as I dislike
to tear myself away,

585
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,469
looks as though I'll have to,

586
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,389
unless of course you still
insist on shooting me.

587
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,890
- I made a mistake, Charles.

588
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,393
- Your mistake almost cost me my life.

589
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,187
- Your life isn't worth
much unless you save Barras.

590
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,022
- That doesn't sound like the Madelon

591
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,066
who had her arms around me a while ago,

592
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,069
but I guess you're pretty free
with your arms these days,

593
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,279
aren't you?

594
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,280
- Don't tempt me.

595
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,490
I still have the gun.

596
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,119
- What ever happened to
the Madelon I once knew?

597
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,912
- You had a chance to find out.

598
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,539
That chance won't come again.

599
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,583
- You're sure of that?

600
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,417
- Positive.

601
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,051
- Still wanna shoot me?

602
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,346
- I could kill you.

603
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,189
- There's a revolution going on.

604
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,232
Don't stay out late.

605
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,198
- What you say, Saint Just, disturbs me.

606
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,657
- I'm not sure, but it looked as if

607
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,659
he were trying to help Barras to escape.

608
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,703
- The man's record is perfect.

609
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,288
- Duval's record is perfect.

610
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,289
- Huh?

611
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,041
What do you mean?

612
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,294
- Fouche told me about an
incident that happened at the inn.

613
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,463
The innkeeper didn't
seem to recognize Duval

614
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,006
the second time he saw him.

615
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:22,675
- I need proof.

616
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,344
Duval's a powerful man in Strasbourg.

617
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,513
I can't afford to antagonize
his element there.

618
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,097
- You'll have proof.

619
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,183
His wife arrives at noon today.

620
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:33,895
- Citizen Duval.

621
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,731
- Send him in.

622
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,111
- Well, good morning, gentlemen.

623
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,281
We had a profitable night.

624
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,618
Barras is in prison and
three of his best men dead.

625
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,744
- What about the book?

626
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,538
- That's why I'm here.

627
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,122
- Your time is getting short.

628
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,460
- Why did you kill Castel,
Bernard, and Lambert last night?

629
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,045
- What makes you think it was me?

630
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,088
- It wasn't Fouche,

631
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,047
Barras is in prison,

632
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,507
and I didn't do it.

633
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,467
That leads only you, Saint Just.

634
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,594
- Let credit fall where credit is due.

635
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:08,888
- I'll never find the book

636
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,141
if he keeps killing off the
only people I can question.

637
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,227
- Dead enemies make good friends.

638
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,066
- You know, if I'm to be
of any service to you,

639
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,026
you've got to take me
into your confidence.

640
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,654
- What is it you'd like to know?

641
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,281
- In all three rooms of the slain men,

642
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,615
nothing was disturbed.

643
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,369
No attempt was made to
search for the black book.

644
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:32,495
I want to know why.

645
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,624
- Perhaps you'd better
answer that, Saint Just.

646
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,004
- You have the reputation for
being a clever man, Duval.

647
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,590
Suppose you find the answers.

648
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,634
- Thank you.

649
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:47,844
I will.

650
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,518
- We should hold him till we're sure!

651
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,479
- I always believe in
giving a man enough rope.

652
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,790
- I've come to question
the prisoner Barras.

653
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,462
- The Committee of
Public Safety's authority

654
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,172
is good enough for me.

655
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,102
Just shout when you're finished.

656
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,565
- Barras.

657
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,234
- What do you want?

658
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:46,986
- I didn't turn you in, Barras.

659
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,571
- Saint Just just happened
to be in your carriage?

660
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:49,489
- You've got to trust me.

661
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,323
I'm here to help you.

662
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:51,449
- I don't need your help,

663
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,160
citizen prosecutor, terror of Strasbourg!

664
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,745
- I'm not Duval.

665
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:56,955
I'm Charles D'Aubigny.

666
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:57,789
- Lafayette.

667
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,207
- I'm his agent.

668
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:00,583
- What trick is it this time?

669
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,044
- Last night Castel, Bernard,
and Lambert were assassinated.

670
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:03,878
- By whom?

671
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,879
- Saint Just.

672
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,258
- Then it's all over.

673
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,387
- There's only one way I can save you.

674
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,596
We've got to find that black book.

675
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,931
- I told you it was none of my men.

676
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,141
- Then why were they killed last night?

677
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,602
- Part of some fiendish
plot of Robespierre.

678
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,145
- None of the rooms of the
murdered men were searched.

679
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,355
If they weren't killed for the black book,

680
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,231
what's behind it all?

681
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,065
- Fear.

682
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,400
Divide and conquer.

683
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,276
Plot as old as Caesar.

684
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,570
Robespierre's plan is
to break up the party.

685
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,530
Since the book disappeared

686
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,949
some of my men have already
come to distrust each other.

687
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,952
Last night's murders will
make them even more unsure.

688
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,120
By the time the convention meets,

689
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,414
there'll be no one to
oppose his dictatorship.

690
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:40,331
- But if the book's still missing,

691
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,624
how will we dare face the convention?

692
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,584
Some of his own men are
listed in that book.

693
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:44,711
- Then why haven't they come forward?

694
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,130
Whoever has it wouldn't keep silent.

695
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,589
- One man would.

696
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,590
- Who?

697
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,343
- Robespierre.

698
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,678
- Robespierre?

699
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,929
- He never lost the book.

700
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,305
It was never out of his possession.

701
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,306
- Then why—

702
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,017
- Don't you see what he
accomplished with a single lie?

703
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,601
He's had us all on a wild goose chase

704
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,270
searching for something
that was never lost.

705
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,479
That's why those rooms weren't disturbed.

706
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,981
There was nothing to look for.

707
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,024
- If he has it,

708
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,695
then he will become dictator.

709
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,156
- Guard!

710
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,073
Guard!

711
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,074
- D'Aubigny.

712
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,661
If you should find it and I'm not there,

713
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,372
give it to Tallien.

714
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,749
He'll have the courage to use it.

715
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:23,791
- You'll be there.

716
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,001
Hurry up, guard!

717
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,591
Guard!

718
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,801
- What's your hurry, my friend?

719
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,345
The convention doesn't meet till tomorrow.

720
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,972
- Unlock this door.

721
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:38,848
- Is that an order?

722
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,683
- It's a command.

723
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,018
- By whose authority?

724
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,938
- By authority of Robespierre.

725
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,403
- Just a precaution, Duval.

726
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,238
If you are Duval.

727
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,913
By the way, I have good news for you.

728
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,373
Your wife is on her way from Strasbourg.

729
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,168
She should be here at any minute now.

730
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,214
Why don't you just relax until she comes?

731
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,175
Robespierre and I wouldn't
wanna miss the happy reunion.

732
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:22,975
- Citizen Robespierre!

733
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:29,899
- What are your prisoners doing out here?

734
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,693
- This is today's batch
for the guillotine.

735
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,279
- Shoot them out!

736
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,369
- Citizeness Duval, Saint Just.

737
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:42,495
- Greetings.

738
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,746
Fetch citizen Duval.

739
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,335
- I apologize for inconveniencing you.

740
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,504
- I was looking for an
excuse to get to Paris.

741
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,756
There are so many things I want to buy.

742
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,498
- Bobo!

743
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,127
Bobo, Bobo, Bobo!

744
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,590
Bobo, what are you doing in jail?

745
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,258
- Well I—

746
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,260
- Now what has the silly boy done?

747
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,469
- Nothing.

748
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,471
It was just a slight misunderstanding.

749
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,639
My apologies, Duval.

750
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,934
You see, in my position,
one can't be too careful.

751
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,103
- I compliment you on your thoroughness.

752
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,355
You too, Saint Just.

753
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,775
- Come, Bobo.

754
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,485
We have so much to do.

755
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,070
- Yes, my love.

756
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:00,907
- Wait for me.

757
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,326
I was told I could find
citizen Robespierre here.

758
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:07,038
- And who wishes to see
citizen Robespierre?

759
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,497
- Madame Duval.

760
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,250
- Inform citizen Robespierre that

761
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,003
Madame Duval desires an audience.

762
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,296
- I'm not accustomed
to being kept waiting.

763
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,634
- Perhaps citizen Saint Just can help you.

764
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,345
- At your service, Madame.

765
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,889
- I'll speak to no one
but citizen Robespierre.

766
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,378
- We all make mistakes.

767
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:39,422
- No one's perfect.

768
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:49,890
- Where's Madame Duval?

769
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,767
- I am Madame Duval.

770
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:52,727
- Get him!

771
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:00,818
- That was close.

772
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,778
How'd you know about Duval's wife?

773
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,364
- Uh, one of our men
recognized her at the border.

774
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,782
Lucille took her place.

775
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,061
We've got to get out of Paris.

776
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,354
- Drop me at the bakery.

777
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,618
- Greetings, Duval.

778
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,244
- Greetings, patriot.

779
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,329
Has Robespierre returned?

780
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,165
- He's over at the prison
on some important business.

781
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,167
- That's what I like to hear.

782
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,258
- Greetings, citizen Duval.

783
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,468
- Greetings, patriot.

784
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,017
Greetings, patriot.

785
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,273
Nice patriot.

786
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:37,915
- Greetings to you, patriot.

787
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,877
Last I heard you were in jail.

788
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,797
- That fool Saint Just
didn't think I was Duval.

789
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,882
- But of course you proved otherwise.

790
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:47,883
- Of course.

791
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,803
- Saint Just is a fool.

792
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,722
Ah ah ah ah, please Charles.

793
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:55,850
No violence.

794
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,062
- You once spoke about
working together, Fouche.

795
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,022
- The offer I made was to Duval.

796
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,567
But I'd make to you the same offer.

797
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,111
After all, we're both
out for the same thing.

798
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:10,281
- But I know where it is.

799
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,282
- Where?

800
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,076
- What are you after?

801
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,578
- Once Robespierre is eliminated,

802
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,371
I want joint power with Barras.

803
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,498
- Only Barras can give you that.

804
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,376
- Barras is in no position to bargain now.

805
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,258
What's your answer, me or Robespierre?

806
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,885
- You're the lesser of two evils, Fouche.

807
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,470
You have my word.

808
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,804
We break into this room.

809
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,556
- What for?

810
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,392
- The black book.

811
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,187
- In Robespierre's own room?

812
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,940
- It was never out of that room.

813
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:45,900
- What?

814
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,653
Oh.

815
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,447
What a clever rascal.

816
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,200
I'm afraid I underestimated Max.

817
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,632
- Hurry up, Fouche.

818
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,885
- You forget this is not
my regular profession.

819
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,129
It's not in the desk.

820
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:52,800
- It's got to be in this room.

821
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,644
- VVell.

822
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,397
There's your black book.

823
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,399
All you have to do is
to find the right one.

824
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,485
- It'll take forever
to go through all this.

825
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,861
- Maybe we'll be lucky.

826
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,196
You start over there.

827
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,668
- Fouche!

828
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,669
Fouche!

829
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,546
Look at the names!

830
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,841
- Is my name in it?

831
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,301
- Let's see.

832
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,844
Barras.

833
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:01,845
Lafayette.

834
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:03,847
Tallien.

835
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:05,849
Berdam.

836
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:07,893
Fouche.

837
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:00,279
- Seize him!

838
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,297
Do something!

839
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,336
- Some cabbages, citizen?

840
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,629
Freshly cut last night.

841
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,131
- Artichokes?

842
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:03,926
- Pierre.

843
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,928
This customer is asking for artichokes.

844
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,225
- Artichokes are out of season.

845
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,185
- I was told I could find some here.

846
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,063
- They're very expensive.

847
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,232
How many did you want?

848
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,901
- Three large, three small.

849
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:29,660
- I thought you'd never get here.

850
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:30,744
- I almost didn't.

851
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,496
- Did you find it?

852
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,539
- Those gendarmes are going
through the marketplace.

853
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,165
They must be looking for you.

854
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:39,503
- Won't be safe anywhere in Paris!

855
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,296
- What about your sister's farm?

856
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,130
- Good.

857
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,049
You can hide out there until
the convention meets tomorrow.

858
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,175
Keep this.

859
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,051
It will be safer with you.

860
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,265
- I'll go with Charles.

861
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,225
- Never get out of the
city in those clothes.

862
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,268
I'll get you some others.

863
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,352
- We'll meet tomorrow at daybreak

864
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:56,478
in the Cafe of the Living Dead.

865
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,396
Good luck.

866
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,259
- Where are your papers?

867
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:28,844
- I told you, I lost them.

868
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,346
But ask anyone in the market.

869
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,264
They'll tell you who we are.

870
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,516
- I am not interested in who you are,

871
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,351
but who you gave your papers too.

872
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,103
- Is it against the
law to lose one's papers?

873
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,647
- No, but it's treason to
give them to a traitor!

874
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:44,943
- Well if a traitor found our
papers, we can't help that.

875
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,990
- Where is your horse and cart?

876
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,576
- In the stables where
we always leave them.

877
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,286
- Your stall is empty.

878
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,624
- Oh, well, they have been stolen.

879
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,001
- Arrest them!

880
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,419
Make them talk!

881
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,643
- They won't talk now.

882
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:18,936
- We'll catch them at the farm.

883
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:19,937
Come on.

884
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,356
Yah!

885
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,156
- Show your papers.

886
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,671
Farmers, huh?

887
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:46,797
- No.

888
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,924
I'm the viscount Charles D'Aubigny

889
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,469
and this is Marie Antoinette.

890
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,764
- See here where you passed
through only this morning

891
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,391
with a full load of cabbages.

892
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,727
Sure sold them awfully fast.

893
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,063
- There are a lot of
hungry people in Paris.

894
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,691
- Where is your farm?

895
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,818
- About four kilometers from here.

896
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,278
- Then you must pass through here often.

897
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,531
Don't recall seeing your faces before.

898
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,866
- Cabbages don't grow
overnight, my friend.

899
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,703
- What else do you raise?

900
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,997
- Chickens, pigs.

901
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,629
- Pierre.

902
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,985
I'll uh, let you through on one condition.

903
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,403
- What's that?

904
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,362
- Next time you come through,

905
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,239
you bring us a couple of chickens.

906
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,661
- I don't know, you'll have
to ask my wife about that.

907
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:00,662
- One chicken.

908
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,124
- Two chickens.

909
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,669
- Small ones.

910
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,004
- Not too small.

911
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,156
- Yes?

912
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,783
- We're friends of Pierre.

913
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:20,617
- What's happened?

914
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:21,451
- Oh nothing.

915
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,619
Pierre will be here tomorrow.

916
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,621
We'd like to stay for the night.

917
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:28,083
- Come in.

918
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,298
Have you had your supper?

919
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,299
- Not yet.

920
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,552
- I just want a bed.

921
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,347
- Who are you?

922
01:00:45,684 --> 01:00:47,936
- I'm the terror of Strasbourg.

923
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,488
- Come on now, finish your milk.

924
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:00,907
And off to bed.

925
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:15,172
Sit down.

926
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,006
- Thank you.

927
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,340
Are they Pierre's?

928
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,300
- Yes.

929
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,596
It's a pity they have to
grow up in times like these.

930
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:25,765
- Or you can be thankful
they don't live in Paris.

931
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,768
- Sometimes I wish that
Louis were still king.

932
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,187
- Don't say that.

933
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,147
We're never going back.

934
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,149
We're trying to build a better world.

935
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:35,233
It's not easy.

936
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,694
But we're never going back.

937
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,324
- Does anyone know where we're heading?

938
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,703
Did you ever live on a farm?

939
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,205
- I was born on one.

940
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,290
What is it?

941
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:51,291
- Look.

942
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,878
Wake your man, run to the fields!

943
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:55,795
I'll hide the cart.

944
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:56,963
- Charles!

945
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,173
Charles, wake up!

946
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,342
The soldiers are coming!

947
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,428
Charles!

948
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:09,392
- That way.

949
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,166
- Anybody home?

950
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,019
Is anybody home?

951
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,062
- Just grandma.

952
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:55,855
- Where is she?

953
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,983
- Bringing in Celeste.

954
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,442
- Who is Celeste?

955
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,528
- My, my, my cow.

956
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,698
- Where's your mother and father?

957
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,574
- They, they went to the market.

958
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,243
- Have you seen any strangers?

959
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,038
Have you?

960
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,333
- What do you want here?

961
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,918
- We're looking for a man and woman,

962
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,420
traitors to the republic.

963
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,216
- Well, you won't find them in that bed.

964
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,444
- This is the farm of Pierre
and Marie Blanchard, isn't it?

965
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,195
- Pierre is my son.

966
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,116
- Your son and his wife have
been arrested for treason.

967
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,411
- No.

968
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,955
- If we don't find the traitors,

969
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,291
they'll both be executed tomorrow.

970
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,298
If you know anything, grandma,
you better speak up now.

971
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:05,592
- I know nothing.

972
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,970
- You'll never get anything
out of these farmers.

973
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,315
All right, search the fields.

974
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,238
- Bring me some food and wine.

975
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,406
- Certainly.

976
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,431
- I'm thirsty, grandma!

977
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,358
Who's that man?

978
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,111
- A soldier of the republic.

979
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,695
- What's he want?

980
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,240
- He's thirsty too.

981
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,662
- Come here, little one.

982
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,459
Would you like to be a
soldier when you grow up?

983
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,753
You could have a horse, sword,

984
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,506
and a gun.

985
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,717
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

986
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:33,721
But a good soldier never lies.

987
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,390
He always tells the truth.

988
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,602
Have you seen any strangers today,

989
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,896
a man and a woman?

990
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:51,865
You can tell me.

991
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,951
One soldier to another.

992
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,289
- Will I get a horse?

993
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,000
- You can have mine.

994
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,477
Well?

995
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,647
- I didn't see anybody!

996
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,574
- More wine for a soldier of the republic?

997
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,721
Swine.

998
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,224
- What's that you said?

999
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,726
- Some more wine?

1000
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:03,728
- Well?

1001
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,524
- Not a trace of them, anywhere.

1002
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,901
- Can't get very far
with a horse and cart.

1003
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,945
- Maybe they've gone to the next town.

1004
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,489
- They've got to be in
Paris by tomorrow morning.

1005
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,241
This is as far as they'd go.

1006
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,325
Keep searching.

1007
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,786
- I left the men those orders.

1008
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,083
- I'm dead on my feet.

1009
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:27,794
I'm going to take a nap.

1010
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,880
Wake me up in a half an hour.

1011
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,216
- You're not going to
disturb the children?

1012
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:36,886
- I'll take the cot.

1013
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:37,929
Get me a pillow.

1014
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,242
Never mind.

1015
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,331
I said never mind!

1016
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,278
- What are you doing?

1017
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,238
- I was just covering him.

1018
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:21,741
- Get away from there.

1019
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,112
- It's Saint Just.

1020
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,530
- Where?

1021
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:01,781
- Sleeping on the cot.

1022
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,826
- He must've found the book.

1023
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,869
- No, he'd be gone now if he had.

1024
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:09,539
He must be sleeping right
on it if it's still there.

1025
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:11,749
No no, don't get up.

1026
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,627
There's a sergeant sitting at the table.

1027
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,922
- The soldiers will be back any minute.

1028
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,254
- Get in there and put a stop to it!

1029
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:34,517
- We're safe now I think.

1030
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:35,643
- No, wait a minute.

1031
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:39,397
We didn't lose them.

1032
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:51,617
They'll overtake us riding double.

1033
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,035
We'd better hide in here.

1034
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,874
- These woods are full of caverns.

1035
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,501
They can't search every one of them.

1036
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:20,688
Think they've gone?

1037
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,023
- I better have a look.

1038
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,736
- Spread your men outside the woods.

1039
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,780
We'll wait here for them to come out.

1040
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,717
- They're laying a trap
for us in the woods.

1041
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,052
There must be another way to Paris.

1042
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,386
- Only the main road.

1043
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:54,847
- If only the moon weren't so bright,

1044
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,599
we could make a run for it.

1045
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,225
- We'd better wait.

1046
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,144
Maybe the clouds will cover the moon.

1047
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,620
There are the clouds.

1048
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,038
You'll have to ride fast.

1049
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:21,916
Don't look back.

1050
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:20,266
- Where has Charles
D'Aubigny taken the book?

1051
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,226
To whom?

1052
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,024
I'm asking you for the last time.

1053
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:33,779
Make her talk!

1054
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,234
- Up to your old tricks, eh?

1055
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,454
I know a much better way
to get the black book.

1056
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,206
- What is your way?

1057
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:26,082
It has to be quick.

1058
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,375
The convention meets in less than an hour.

1059
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:30,711
- Let her down.

1060
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,029
This earring will have more persuasion

1061
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,823
than any of your tortures.

1062
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,663
I'll meet you at the convention.

1063
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,167
- You've done well, Charles.

1064
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,378
This day will see the end of the terror.

1065
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:13,504
- I'll go back for Madelon now.

1066
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:14,922
- Take some men with you.

1067
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:22,179
- Please, gentlemen.

1068
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:25,182
Not so rough.

1069
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,603
Congratulations.

1070
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,440
You came very close, Charles.

1071
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,234
- Not quite close enough, it seems.

1072
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:39,572
- Oh, I uh, have something for you.

1073
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:44,827
- Where is she?

1074
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:45,744
Where is she!

1075
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:49,290
- Being entertained by Robespierre.

1076
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,333
It's either Madelon or the book.

1077
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:52,626
You can't have both.

1078
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,547
- The convention meets
in less than 10 minutes.

1079
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,133
Without this, Robespierre
will become dictator,

1080
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,136
whereon many more will die.

1081
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:03,262
France will die.

1082
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:47,223
- Bring the prisoner Francois Barras.

1083
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:25,803
- This is not a trial.

1084
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,430
Barras is not a prisoner of the bar.

1085
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,309
You are not judges.

1086
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,229
You are statesmen and
representatives of the nation.

1087
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:39,233
In your hands lies the fate of France.

1088
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,988
You have not to pass sentence
for or against a single man.

1089
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,657
This man is already a
self-confessed traitor

1090
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:50,035
by opposing the will of the convention.

1091
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,038
It is you, the members of the convention,

1092
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,250
who must take a resolution on
the question of public safety,

1093
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,837
and to decide a question
of national foresight.

1094
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:03,215
It is with regret that I
pronounce the fatal truth.

1095
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,466
Barras ought to perish

1096
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,136
rather than this convention
be torn with disunity.

1097
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,388
Barras must die,

1098
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:12,516
that the country may live.

1099
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:37,791
- Madelon!

1100
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:42,588
Madelon!

1101
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,549
- There is a cord about
the throat of liberty,

1102
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:49,636
and both ends I held my traitors
like Barras and his party!

1103
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,264
I demand a decree of
accusation against them!

1104
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,892
I demand a declaration
of national emergency!

1105
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,436
I demand a suspension
of all legal procedures!

1106
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,563
I demand that this
convention by unanimous vote

1107
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,691
vest in me the authority of
sole and absolute dictatorship!

1108
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:03,734
- Never!

1109
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:04,568
- No!

1110
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,778
- Down with dictators!

1111
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,946
- I denounce Robespierre!

1112
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,323
- We must uphold liberty!

1113
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:10,324
- Never!

1114
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,576
- No dictator for France!

1115
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,453
- Citizens!

1116
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:15,871
You'll destroy yourselves!

1117
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:18,123
- I denounce Robespierre!

1118
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,126
- Down with Robespierre!

1119
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:27,633
- Down on his head!

1120
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:30,010
- Danton's blood will
choke in your throat!

1121
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,762
- Take him to the guillotine!

1122
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,148
- Citizens!

1123
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,689
- Max, Max, they'll kill us!

1124
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:25,315
- Death is no stranger to me.

1125
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,901
- The mob's gone mad,
they'll tear us to pieces!

1126
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,029
- I made the mob.

1127
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,573
The mob are my children.

1128
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,534
They won't turn against their father.

1129
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,846
If it is my life you want, take it.

1130
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,848
One more life isn't important.

1131
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,101
What is important is
the will of the people.

1132
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:04,104
I fought to give the people the right

1133
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,898
to exercise their own will.

1134
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,443
I fought to give France
back to the people.

1135
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,070
Blood has poured freely.

1136
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,699
If more blood is needed,
you can have mine.

1137
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,870
The greatest death that a man
can die is for his own people.

1138
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,499
But you will be a mob without a leader.

1139
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,294
If I go, who takes my place?

1140
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:28,295
Let the man step forward

1141
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,339
who can follow in the
steps of Robespierre.

1142
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,676
I have led you through the darkness.

1143
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,429
If I sought the power of dictatorship,

1144
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,306
it is not for personal glory.

1145
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,684
Your will is my will.

1146
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,481
I bear no man vengeance.
- Shut his mouth.

1147
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,025
- I have killed only for you.

1148
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,045
- Where is she, Saint Just, where is she!

1149
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:11,630
- Only Robespierre knows!

1150
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,841
- Take him to the guillotine!

1151
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,636
What have you done with Madelon!

1152
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:18,929
- It's no use.

1153
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:20,347
He'll never speak again.

1154
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:21,181
- To the guillotine!

1155
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,697
- Robespierre's last monuments.

1156
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,411
He planned on having
statues built of himself.

1157
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,585
All he leaves behind him is stale bread.

1158
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,672
- The end is
always being put to some use

1159
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,591
in France, citizen.

1160
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,176
The art of being a Frenchman

1161
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,678
is knowing what comes next.

1162
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:31,181
- Have you any idea?

1163
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,559
- I am neither
a Frenchman nor a politician.

1164
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:35,852
I am merely a soldier.

1165
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,772
- Well there friend, must be off.

1166
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:40,816
Perhaps we shall meet again sometime.

1167
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:47,531
Oh uh, by the way, I don't
believe I got your name.

1168
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:51,326
- My name is
Bonaparte, Napoleon Bonaparte.

1169
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:53,245
- Napoleon Bonaparte.

1170
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,497
I'll try to remember that.

1171
