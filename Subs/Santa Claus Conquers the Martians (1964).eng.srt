[MUSIC - "HOORAY FOR SANTA
CLAUS"]

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,731
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): At this time,

3
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,125
Station KID-TV brings you the
special event of the year,

4
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,888
a first in television history.

5
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,111
At this very moment,
KID-TV has standing

6
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,955
by a television crew at
Santa Claus' workshop.

7
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:27,698
And in just a few seconds,
our special correspondent,

8
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:31,392
Andy Henderson, will bring you
a person to person interview

9
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,545
with Santa Claus himself,
direct from the North Pole,

10
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,317
where at the moment,
the temperature

11
00:02:36,317 --> 00:02:39,610
is 91 degrees below zero.

12
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,914
And now KID-TV takes
you via Telstar,

13
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,347
Andy Henderson at
the North Pole.

14
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:47,518
ANDY HENDERSON
(ON TV): Hi, kids.

15
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:50,521
This is Andy Henderson
at the North Pole.

16
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,235
Whoo, it's cold up here.

17
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:56,947
From this spot, there's only
one direction you can go,

18
00:02:56,947 --> 00:03:00,150
and that's south.

19
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,752
Living up here is pretty rough.

20
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:04,615
I don't see how Santa stands it.

21
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:07,798
Since we've been here, we've
eaten nothing but frozen food.

22
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:11,792
At least, that's the way it
is by the time we get it.

23
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,645
And now, let's take a looksee
into Santa's workshop.

24
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,205
Hello again.

25
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:30,801
Boys and girls, it's just
weeks before Christmas,

26
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:33,734
and Santa and his helpers are
working overtime to make sure

27
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:38,329
that there's enough toys for
the kids all over the world.

28
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,870
Santa's a pretty
busy man, but I'm

29
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,135
sure he'd like to say a
few words to you kids.

30
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,206
Hello, Santa.

31
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,439
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, hello, son.

32
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,834
Oh, well, hello boys and girls.

33
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:57,388
Hey... oh, Andy, you caught
me at a very busy time.

34
00:03:57,388 --> 00:03:58,619
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, uh, you

35
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,180
think you'll be ready
by Christmas Eve?

36
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,452
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, we've never

37
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,643
disappointed the kids yet.

38
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:07,127
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Tell
me, is it true that this year,

39
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,860
there's a rumor that you're
going to use a rocket sled?

40
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,822
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): No sir-ee.

41
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,595
We're going out the
good old fashioned way,

42
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:19,360
with my reindeer... Prancer and
Dancer, and Donner and Blitzen,

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,474
and Vixen and
Nixon... hey, Nixon?

44
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:26,066
Oh, where'd I get... Oh,
I always... confound it.

45
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,578
I get those names mixed up.

46
00:04:27,578 --> 00:04:29,670
But the kids know their names.

47
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,323
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Santa, there you are.

48
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,575
We have so much to
do, and you stand here

49
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,707
dawdling, talking
to this visitor.

50
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:40,210
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Mr.
Anderson, this is Mrs. Claus.

51
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,252
Uh, well, dear,
we're on television.

52
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,054
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV): How
do you do, Mr. Anderson.

53
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:44,395
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ma'am.

54
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,566
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Now, I want you

55
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,078
to go and finish painting
those hobby horses.

56
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:49,179
Television?

57
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,712
Did you say we're on television?

58
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:53,514
Oh, oh dear.

59
00:04:53,514 --> 00:04:55,346
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

60
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,418
Oh, my hair's a mess.

61
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,410
Mm-mm... H-hello there.

62
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,851
Oh, oh!

63
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,218
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Come along, Mr. Anderson,

64
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:11,291
and I'll show you some of the
new toys we're turning out.

65
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,699
How's it going, Winky?

66
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,041
WINKY (ON TV): Everything
is A-OK, Santa.

67
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,312
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Good man.

68
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:24,725
Winky is in charge of
our space department.

69
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,066
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ah.

70
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,208
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, now here,

71
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,531
here is the latest toy rocket.

72
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,133
It runs on real rocket fuel.

73
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,725
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Really?

74
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,478
I've been wondering, what is
this strange little creature

75
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:38,609
over here?

76
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:40,901
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Oh, uh, Winky made that.

77
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,783
That's his idea of a Martian.

78
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,164
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): A Martian?

79
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,046
Wow-ee-wow, I'd hate
to meet a creature

80
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,408
like that on a dark night.

81
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:48,529
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh-ho-ho.

82
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:49,900
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): I wonder if there

83
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,821
really are people on Mars.

84
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,052
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, who knows.

85
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,323
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, if there

86
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,275
are, I hope they have someone
like you up there, Santa,

87
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:58,439
to bring joy and good cheer
to all the Martian children.

88
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:01,682
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh,
Mr. Anders... Ho-ho-ho.

89
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:03,484
Well, keep going, Winky.

90
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,386
Christmas Eve is coming soon.

91
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:08,318
Now Mr. Anderson, I want to
show you some more things.

92
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,129
Now you...

93
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:09,830
Dropo?

94
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:14,194
Dropo, you lazy,
good-for-nothing,

95
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,406
where are you?

96
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,573
Dropo, Dropo, wake up.

97
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:23,564
Wake up.

98
00:06:27,998 --> 00:06:30,821
[LAUGHING]

99
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:34,775
Oh, please turn
off that tickle ray.

100
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,257
KIMAR: Stand up.

101
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:38,128
Stand up.

102
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:42,743
Stand up.

103
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,395
Stand up.

104
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,247
I'm sorry, Ki... Kimar, sir.

105
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:50,020
Dropo, you are the
laziest man on Mars.

106
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,813
Why are you sleeping
during working hours?

107
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,895
I wasn't sleeping, Chief.

108
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,797
It's just that I haven't
been able to sleep

109
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:58,779
these last few nights.

110
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,020
I forgot how.

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,061
So I was just practicing.

112
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:08,138
Well I suggest you
practice doing your work.

113
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,359
Where's Lady Momar?

114
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,961
Oh, she went to
the food pill center

115
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,793
to get some new food pills.

116
00:07:12,793 --> 00:07:14,384
The children haven't
been eating well.

117
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:15,876
No appetite at all.

118
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,458
Oh, it's no wonder.

119
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,199
They sit in front of
the video set all day,

120
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,582
watching those ridiculous
Earth programs.

121
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,614
It confuses them.

122
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:25,506
Where are they?

123
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:28,168
Oh, in there watching
Earth programs.

124
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:39,069
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Say,
Santa, what have we here?

125
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,440
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
These are new dolls.

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,825
Now, this little doll
walks, talks, cries,

127
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:47,207
and she even sings.

128
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,820
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Almost
like a real, live little girl.

129
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,763
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): That
she is sir, that she is.

130
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,306
All she needs is
tender loving care.

131
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:59,249
Bomar, what is a doll?

132
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,031
I don't know, Girmar.

133
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,893
What is tender loving care?

134
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,284
I don't know, either.

135
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,659
Bomar, Girmar, I
told you not to watch

136
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,931
those silly Earth programs.

137
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,142
Now go to sleep.

138
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,324
Must we go to
sleep now, Father?

139
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,597
I want to see Santa
Claus some more.

140
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,468
I want to see more toys.

141
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:19,169
No.

142
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:19,890
Go to sleep.

143
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:38,639
Hello, Dropo.

144
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,310
I see you're keeping busy.

145
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,863
Oh, I've been working
very hard, Lady Momar.

146
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,555
I've been vacuuming the room.

147
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:45,305
Good.

148
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,547
Is the master here?

149
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:47,628
Oh, he's in there.

150
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,030
And Kimar is very angry, too.

151
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,052
Kimar, I bought
some new food pills.

152
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,664
I hope the children
will eat these.

153
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:59,269
We have hamburger, buttered
asparagus, mashed potatoes,

154
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,373
and a special treat for them,
chocolate layer cake pills.

155
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:06,647
Momar, I'm worried
about our children.

156
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,529
So am I. They've hardly
eaten a thing in three days.

157
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,702
It goes deeper than that.

158
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:12,873
They're behaving strangely.

159
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:13,934
They appear to be troubled.

160
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:15,696
They don't care to sleep.

161
00:09:15,696 --> 00:09:18,589
I had to use the sleep
spray on them again.

162
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:20,500
I mentioned this to my
council chiefs today,

163
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,413
and I learned it's the same with
children all around the planet,

164
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,786
in every district.

165
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:29,890
Something is happening
to the children of Mars.

166
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,212
Kimar, as the leader
of the Martians,

167
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:35,345
you must do something about it.

168
00:09:35,345 --> 00:09:37,628
I know, but what?

169
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,620
Why don't you go to
the forest and see

170
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,201
Chochem, the ancient one.

171
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,322
He'll know what to do.

172
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,844
He's never failed you.

173
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,585
You speak wisely.

174
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,268
I will go.

175
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,040
Attention, council chiefs.

176
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,741
Please report.

177
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:54,715
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Lomas reporting.

178
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,216
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Rigna reporting.

179
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:57,788
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Hargo here.

180
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:00,070
Voldar?

181
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,552
Voldar, please report.

182
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,945
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Voldar reporting.

183
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:07,447
Gentlemen of the council,
we will meet immediately

184
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:10,260
at Chochum's Chair
in Thunder Forest.

185
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,532
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON INTERCOM):
What's wrong now, Kimar?

186
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,805
I don't know, Voldar.

187
00:10:14,805 --> 00:10:16,156
But I mean to find out.

188
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,440
Where's Kimar?

189
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,783
He should be here any moment.

190
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,264
What's this all about?

191
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:26,757
We'll find out
when Kimar arrives.

192
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,330
We are probably going to
seek the advice of Chochum.

193
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,303
What does Kimar think we
are, a kindergarten class?

194
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:35,235
Can't we make our own decisions?

195
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,078
Must we always come crawling
to that [INAUDIBLE] old man?

196
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,070
Chochum is 800 years old.

197
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,603
You can't dismiss the
wisdom of centuries.

198
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:44,484
I can.

199
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:45,185
Gentlemen.

200
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,399
Thank you for coming.

201
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:54,614
Chochum?

202
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,321
Chochum, are you here?

203
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:05,726
Ancient One of Mars,
I call upon you.

204
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:10,300
Chochum, it is I, Kimar,
and the council chiefs.

205
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,601
We need you, Chochum.

206
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:36,496
You called me, Kimar?

207
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,890
We need your advice, Chochum.

208
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,723
Something is wrong
with our children.

209
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:43,864
They eat not.

210
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:45,615
They sleep not.

211
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:48,338
Their only interest is
watching meaningless Earth

212
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:50,741
programs on the video.

213
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:55,295
Wh-wh-what time
of year is it now?

214
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:57,107
KIMAR: It is the
middle of Septober.

215
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,639
No, no.

216
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,082
Not here.

217
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,203
I mean on Earth.

218
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,969
Ah, yes.

219
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:13,433
It is early December on Earth.

220
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,725
Close to the time
of the Christmas.

221
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:21,171
That explains it.

222
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:23,904
What is a Christmas?

223
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:30,680
It is an occasion for great joy
and peace on the planet Earth.

224
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:39,960
And for children, it is
also a time of anticipation,

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,706
as they await the arrival of
Santa Claus and his gifts.

226
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:49,379
Bah, what nonsense.

227
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,482
What has this to do with
our children, Ancient One?

228
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:56,726
We have no children on Mars.

229
00:12:56,726 --> 00:13:02,452
They have children's bodies,
but with adult minds.

230
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,294
They do not have a childhood.

231
00:13:08,218 --> 00:13:12,542
I've seen this
coming for centuries.

232
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,885
They are born.

233
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:18,829
Our electronic teaching machines
are attached to their brains

234
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,052
while they are in their cradles.

235
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:27,607
Information is fed into their
minds in a constant stream.

236
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,822
And by the time they can
walk, they are adults.

237
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:37,817
They've never played.

238
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,451
They've never
learned to have fun.

239
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:46,957
And now, now they are rebelling.

240
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:49,069
What do you advise?

241
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,813
The children must be
allowed to be children again.

242
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:57,357
They must learn to play.

243
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:02,282
They must learn what
it means to have fun.

244
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:05,936
We need a Santa Claus on Mars.

245
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:30,560
Santa Claus on Mars?

246
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,402
Where will we
get a Santa Claus?

247
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:36,927
There's only one Santa
Claus, and he's on Earth.

248
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:39,869
Well, I guess that
takes care of that.

249
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,972
Didn't I tell you it
was a foolish idea

250
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,483
to seek advice
from that old man?

251
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,445
This is a serious
matter, Voldar.

252
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:48,638
And desperate problems
require desperate deeds.

253
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,151
Earth has had Santa
Claus long enough.

254
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,052
We will bring him to Mars.

255
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,363
I'm against it.

256
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:55,665
Our children are fine
the way they are.

257
00:14:55,665 --> 00:14:58,638
I don't want any Santa Claus
bringing them toys and games.

258
00:14:58,638 --> 00:14:59,950
They'll start
playing and laughing

259
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,790
and running under foot.

260
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,771
They'll become a nuisance.

261
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,623
I've made my decision.

262
00:15:03,623 --> 00:15:06,386
We leave for Earth tonight.

263
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:09,469
Rigna, Lomas, prepare
spaceship number one.

264
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,675
Approaching
projected Earth orbit.

265
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,802
Fire port side rockets
number one and number two.

266
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:06,987
Port side rockets number
one and number two, fired.

267
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,951
Entering Earth orbit.

268
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,323
All right, Voldar.

269
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,085
Now to find Santa Claus.

270
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,037
Turn on your magnascope
to third power.

271
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:23,973
We're over a city of some kind.

272
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,641
So that's what the Earth
people call a city, eh?

273
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:33,523
How primitive.

274
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:36,676
Look at all those
buildings above ground.

275
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:40,140
Why, we could destroy that city
with one blast of our Q-ray.

276
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,532
We've not come here
to destroy anyone.

277
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:46,486
Our only purpose is to bring
Santa Claus back to Mars.

278
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:48,118
Turn to fifth power.

279
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:49,989
Let's see if we can
locate Santa Claus.

280
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,226
He wears a red suit,
trimmed with white fur,

281
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:58,348
and he has a long white beard.

282
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,610
But there are millions
of people down there.

283
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,894
It's like looking for a speck
of space dust in a comet's tail.

284
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:06,066
Wait a minute.

285
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,047
I see him.

286
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:08,318
I see Santa Claus.

287
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,372
I see him, too.

288
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:14,704
He's standing on the
corner, ringing a bell.

289
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:15,825
No he's not.

290
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,867
He's standing near the
entrance of a large building,

291
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,699
next to a large black kettle.

292
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:20,980
He's standing on
the corner, Kimar.

293
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,952
He's... wait a minute.

294
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,334
I see another one.

295
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,106
Why, there are hundreds of
Santa Clauses down there.

296
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,027
Are we going to bring them
all back with us to Mars?

297
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,299
Just one.

298
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,062
And with so many,
they won't miss one.

299
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,683
Prepare for landing
on next orbit.

307
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,277
or whatever it is.

308
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:49,729
The US Air Force has
alerted all defense

310
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:17,217
Sir, Earth radar beams
are bouncing off our ship.

311
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:19,759
Well, it certainly
took them long enough.

312
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,273
Voldar, turn on
the radar shield.

313
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:24,724
Dysfunctioning of radar shield.

314
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,116
Rigna, check the radar box.

315
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:30,990
Radar shield functioning.

316
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,872
What was wrong, Rigna?

317
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:35,275
A slight case of Dropo.

318
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:36,126
Oh, hi Chief.

319
00:18:36,126 --> 00:18:37,407
What are you doing here, Dropo?

320
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,609
Oh, well, Chief, I went
to the launching pad

321
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:42,282
so I could say goodbye
to you, and I remembered,

322
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,233
I've never been to Earth!

323
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,234
So I thought I wanted to see...

324
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:46,005
I may leave you there
in place of Santa Claus.

325
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,327
Now get below.

326
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,808
I'll deal with you later.

327
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,733
Dropo, get below quickly.

328
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:54,514
Yes chief.

329
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:55,215
Yes.

330
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:55,915
Yes chief.

331
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:56,686
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,321
Prepare to land.

333
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:05,034
We'll set down in that
field near the lake.

00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:07,897
Rocket silencers set.

335
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:13,152

00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:42,211
Professor [INAUDIBLE] Von
Green, our leading space expert,

353
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:45,084
is still convinced it
was a Martian spaceship.

354
00:20:45,084 --> 00:20:49,419
Stay tuned for
further bulletins.

355
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:52,512
Billy, what does a
Martian look like?

356
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,493
I don't know.

357
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:56,155
Nobody's ever seen one.

358
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,518
I don't believe there
are any Martians.

359
00:20:58,518 --> 00:20:59,569
You don't, huh?

360
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:02,762
What would you do if a Martian
walked right up behind you?

361
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,825
I'd scream.

362
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:06,806
[SCREAMS]

363
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,758
Ah, stop doing that.

364
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,219
I'm trying to sleep.

365
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,181
I see a Martian.

366
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:15,104
Boy, you and your imagination.

367
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:19,038
Come on, let's go home.

368
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,620
Who... who are you?

369
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,021
We're from Mars.

370
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,473
Don't be afraid.

371
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:26,055
We have children just
like you on Mars.

372
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:29,108
What are those funny things
sticking out of your head.

373
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,630
Those are our antenna.

374
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,972
Are you a television set?

375
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,345
Shh.

376
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:37,537
Stupid question.

377
00:21:37,537 --> 00:21:40,109
Is this what you want to
do to our children on Mars?

378
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,101
Turn them into
nincompoops like these?

379
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,354
Hold your tongue, Voldar?

380
00:21:44,354 --> 00:21:45,995
What's your name, little boy?

381
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:47,136
Billy.

382
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,218
Billy Foster, sir.

383
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:50,790
And this is my sister, Betty.

384
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,353
Well perhaps you
can help us, Billy.

385
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,565
We're looking for one
of your Santa Clauses.

386
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,687
There's only one Santa Claus.

387
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,769
We've seen many of
them in your cities.

388
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:00,470
Oh.

389
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,632
Those are his helpers.

390
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:05,214
There's only one
real Santa Claus.

391
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:08,518
And he's in his workshop
up at the North Pole.

392
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,470
That's what we came
here to find out.

393
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,691
Let's go.

394
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:12,962
Come on, you two.

395
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:13,853
Let me go!

396
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,194
Where are you taking us?

397
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:16,275
Leave them alone, Voldar!

398
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:17,106
What?

399
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,828
And leave them here to
inform the authorities?

400
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:20,019
He's right, Kimar.

401
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,811
We'd better take them along
with us to North Pole.

402
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:25,765
Very well.

403
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:26,466
Come along.

404
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:33,693
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): This
morning, two children

405
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:36,766
disappeared mysteriously in
the vicinity of Welsh Lake.

406
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:38,498
The police have found no clues.

407
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,730
And it seems as though
Billy and Betty Foster

408
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,612
have simply vanished
into thin air.

409
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,283
This appears to be a
day when everything

410
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:45,845
is vanishing into thin air.

411
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:47,717
While local police are
continuing their search

412
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,559
for the missing children,
the armed forces

413
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,701
are continuing their search
for the mysterious object

414
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:52,402
from space.

415
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,666
All right, Billy and Betty.

416
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,376
Nobody here.

417
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,639
Come on in.

418
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,339
Golly.

419
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,744
Now, I'm not supposed
to bring you here.

420
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:18,418
The chief's going to be
awful mad if he finds us.

421
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,940
Boy, wait 'til the
kids at home find

422
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,724
that I was in a real
Martian spaceship.

423
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:28,367
No... no, don't touch anything.

424
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,109
Now, here.

425
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,662
That's the
anti-gravity generator.

426
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,455
And these are the retro rockets.

427
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,807
Does this light up?

428
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,570
Only when radar waves
are bouncing off our ship.

429
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,652
Then we put up
this radar screen.

430
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:44,734
Then nobody can
find us in space.

431
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:47,026
Boy, that's pretty sharp.

432
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,397
Yep.

433
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:49,999
What's this, Dropo?

434
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:52,201
Oh, that's the elevator signal.

435
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:54,263
That light starts
flashing when somebody's

436
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,555
coming up from the
navigation deck.

437
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:02,071
Oh... oh, oh.

438
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,563
BILLY: Somebody's coming up.

439
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,555
We better get out of here.

440
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:06,546
No, no, no!

441
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,047
There's no time for that.

442
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,038
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble.

443
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,530
Oh, no time.

444
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,521
Here.

445
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:12,321
Here, here.

446
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,022
Quick.

447
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,493
Thinking of taking another
nap in the radar box, Dropo?

448
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:35,915
Oh, oh, no sir.

449
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,898
As a matter of fact, I
was just looking in there

450
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:42,051
to remind myself never
to hide in there again.

451
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:42,752
I bet.

452
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,452
No.

453
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,146
Approaching North Pole.

454
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:52,792
I can see Santa Claus' workshop.

455
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,498
Prepare for landing.

456
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,891
Hargo, set the rocket silences.

457
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:03,192
Dropo?

458
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:05,194
You stay aboard and
guard those children.

459
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,707
They must not
leave the ship now.

460
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,810
Now, or never?

461
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,151
What do you mean, Voldar?

462
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:14,353
If we take them
with us to Mars,

463
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:17,376
Santa's disappearance
would remain a mystery.

464
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,639
No one on Earth will
ever know that Santa

465
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:21,320
Claus was kidnapped by Martians.

466
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:25,565
Perhaps you're right.

467
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,255
Dropo?

468
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:27,046
Yes sir?

469
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:28,337
Get back to those
children, and don't

470
00:25:28,337 --> 00:25:29,458
let them out of your sight.

471
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:30,159
Understand?

472
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,140
Yes, sir I understand.

473
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,371
I... I'll keep an eye.

474
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:43,923
We've landed.

475
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,045
Secure the ship.

476
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,387
Lomas, you remain
on guard and have

477
00:25:48,387 --> 00:25:51,420
the ship ready for
immediate blast off.

478
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,222
Rigna, Hargo, Voldar,
you'll accompany me.

479
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:53,923
Come.

480
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,565
We'll activate Torg.

481
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:57,046
Torg?

482
00:25:57,046 --> 00:26:00,770
To capture a roly poly
little man like Santa Claus?

483
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,051
We don't need Torg.

484
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:04,483
We won't take any chances.

485
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:05,725
Come.

486
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:06,836
Nothing can stop Torg.

487
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:29,288
They're going to kidnap
Santa Claus, and us, too.

488
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,850
Not if we can help it.

489
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,693
We've got to get out
of here and warn Santa.

490
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,984
What's a Torg?

491
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:38,307
I don't know, but
I'm not afraid of it.

492
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,929
It's not going to stop us.

493
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,280
Come on.

494
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,161
Wait, Betty.

495
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,709
BETTY: Why did you do that?

496
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,320
If this ship ever
leaves Earth, we'll

497
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,532
have the whole US
Space Force after them.

498
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:54,233
Come on.

499
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,224
Wait a minute.

500
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:05,174
Come on.

501
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:24,583
BILLY: Come on, Betty.

502
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:18,718
This action must
take place swiftly.

503
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:20,619
We can't afford to
make any mistakes.

504
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:23,682
Hargo, you cover the
rear of the workshop.

505
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:27,056
Rigna, Voldar, cover
the front entrance.

506
00:28:27,056 --> 00:28:28,597
I'll direct Torg.

507
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,609
Voldar isn't here.

508
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:35,384
Rigna, go up and
tell Voldar... Voldar,

509
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:38,267
this is another one of
your delaying tactics.

510
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:40,549
You've been opposing
me at every turn.

511
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:43,092
Now I'm warning you,
change your attitude.

512
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,735
You finished, Chief?

513
00:28:45,735 --> 00:28:46,435
Yes I am.

514
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,107
And you will be, too,
if you're not careful.

515
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:51,510
Oh, but I am carefully, Chief.

516
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,412
So careful that I looked
in at the children

517
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:54,723
before I left the ship.

518
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:56,115
You stay away from
those children.

519
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:57,857
That will be easy to do.

520
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,488
They've escaped.

521
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,670
Voldar, if this is
your idea of a joke...

522
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,012
Ask Dropo.

523
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,884
They overheard our plans.

524
00:29:04,884 --> 00:29:07,146
At this very moment, they're
on their way to Santa Claus

525
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:08,077
to warn him.

526
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,498
It's true, Kimar.

527
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,531
Their footprints.

528
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,843
We must stop them.

529
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,625
Those children mustn't
reach Santa Claus.

530
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,536
Follow them.

531
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,848
I'll put Torg on the trail.

532
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:26,205
Torg, come out of the spaceship.

533
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,596
Torg.

534
00:29:27,596 --> 00:29:29,278
Come out of the spaceship.

535
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:40,629
Billy, I can't run anymore.

536
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,101
I'm cold.

537
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,053
And I'm tired.

538
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:46,505
And it's beginning to snow.

539
00:29:46,505 --> 00:29:47,977
Please, Betty.

540
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:48,948
Try.

541
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:50,910
We've got to warn Santa.

542
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,381
We can't stop now.

543
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,843
They might catch us.

544
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:56,295
Where is Santa?

545
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,276
BILLY: I don't know.

546
00:29:57,276 --> 00:30:00,589
His workshop must be
somewhere around here.

547
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:06,045
Betty, look.

548
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:08,037
It's Voldar.

549
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:12,011
BETTY: He's the mean one,
the one who doesn't like us.

550
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,002
Come on.

551
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,353
Get back.

552
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:55,564
Don't move, Betty.

553
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,026
I'll go take a look.

554
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:07,076
It's all right now, Betty.

555
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:07,776
Come on.

556
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,312
I'm cold.

557
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:16,395
I wish it wouldn't snow.

558
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:18,857
That's the best thing
that could happen.

559
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:22,041
It'll cover our tracks and
be harder for the Martians

560
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,322
to find us.

561
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:27,346
And it'll be harder for us
to find Santa's workshop.

562
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:29,278
I'm scared.

563
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,210
We'll find it.

564
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,661
Which way is north?

565
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:39,428
I see it!

566
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:40,409
I see it!

567
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:42,051
Santa's workshop.

568
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,102
BILLY: Where?

569
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:44,103
Right there.

570
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,594
See the light?

571
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:47,586
Where?

572
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,578
The lights are moving.

573
00:31:55,564 --> 00:31:59,058
They're coming towards us.

574
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:02,041
Betty, that's
not Santa's house.

575
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,753
Wha... What is it?

576
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:05,594
BILLY: I don't know.

577
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:36,115
Good work, Torg.

578
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:37,396
Now destroy them.

579
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:38,797
Crush them.

580
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:40,199
Crush them, Torg.

581
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,690
Do as I say.

582
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,313
Voldar, I knew you'd
try something like this.

583
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:47,036
I set Torg's controls
so he will obey only me.

584
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:48,857
Release them, Torg.

585
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,629
You were very lucky.

586
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:52,901
Now don't try to escape again.

587
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:54,743
You may not be so
lucky next time.

588
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:59,058
Hargo, take them back to ship,
lock them up, and rejoin us.

589
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:02,021
You won't get away with
this, you... you Martian!

590
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,417
The danger grows
with every minute.

591
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,719
Let's get Santa
Claus and blast off.

592
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:14,013
We'll surround the workshop
and send Torg in to get Santa.

593
00:33:14,013 --> 00:33:16,115
Nobody is to be harmed
unless they get in our way.

594
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:17,626
Right.

595
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:19,878
No one is to be harmed.

596
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:23,032
What has happened to the
great warriors of our planet?

597
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:26,125
Mars used to be
the planet of war.

598
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:31,340
Mark my words, Kimar, your
softness will destroy us.

599
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,643
Santa Claus, toys,
games, laughing children.

600
00:33:34,643 --> 00:33:36,635
Well we shall see.

601
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:39,828
But for now, to your posts.

602
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:41,340
Torg, follow me.

603
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,131
Get him, Torg.

604
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,813
You can't come in here.

605
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,785
No one's allowed.

606
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:29,558
Well, where did you come from?

607
00:34:29,558 --> 00:34:31,980
You're the biggest
toy I've ever seen.

608
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,691
[LAUGHING]

609
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:40,539
And very well, made too.

610
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:46,084
By the great dog star, Santa's
treating him like a toy.

611
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,045
Get him, Torg.

612
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,337
Grab him.

613
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,389
He's become a toy.

614
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,811
Rigna, we'll have to
get Santa ourselves.

615
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:53,512
Come on, Voldar.

616
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,150
What have we here?

617
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,711
More toys?

618
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,792
Those are Martians.

619
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:06,044
Santa Claus, you're
coming with us.

620
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:06,745
No.

621
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:07,886
You can't take him now.

622
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,138
It's too near Christmas.

623
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:09,888
Quiet, you.

624
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:10,589
But...

625
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:17,546
We don't want to
hurt you, Santa Claus,

626
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:18,717
so come along quietly.

627
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:28,927
Why... why did you have
to do that to my helper?

628
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:29,628
It's harmless.

629
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:33,312
It'll wear off in a short while.

630
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:35,294
Oh.

631
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:37,636
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

632
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,797
Now you come with us.

633
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:40,038
We need you on Mars.

634
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:50,889
Are you sure this is harmless?

635
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,363
Oh, I never saw
such lazy people,

636
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:56,785
standing around like statues.

637
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:58,397
There's work to be done.

638
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,518
Let's get to it.

639
00:36:02,831 --> 00:36:08,857
Oh me, oh my, oh me,
oh... oh, Mrs. Claus

640
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:12,791
is going to be very
angry about this.

641
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,294
Take him, Torg.

642
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:17,806
Torg, take him.

643
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,878
Obey my command.

644
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,820
Forget it, Kimar.

645
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,752
Rigna was right.

646
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:26,545
He's nothing but a toy now.

647
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:28,827
Best to leave him here.

648
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:34,683
Believe me, I had nothing
whatsoever to do about this.

649
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:38,046
You know my dear, I
can't recall a time

650
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:41,390
when you were so
silent for so long.

identified the

Never in the history of mankind
have the nations of the world

655
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,801
reacted with such
unanimity and cooperation.

And at Cape Kennedy,
our correspondent

interviewed
[INAUDIBLE] Von Green,

661
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:27,145
the man in charge of
America's Starshot program.

662
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,517
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Mr. Von Green,

663
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:31,119
what is the space
agency doing about this?

664
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,241
VON GREEN (ON TV): Well, they
have mobilized all the men

665
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,914
and equipment in our
Starshot project.

666
00:37:35,914 --> 00:37:37,286
And we have rushed
our astronauts

667
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,818
into an intensive program
for the final phase

668
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:40,969
of their training.

669
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,681
Now, our Starshot
ship is supposed

670
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:44,813
undergo six months
of test flights.

671
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:47,296
But we are going to
forget about the testing

672
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:50,819
and go after those
Martian monkeys.

00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:52,291
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Isn't that risky?

674
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,822
VON GREEN (ON TV): Of
course it is risky.

675
00:37:53,822 --> 00:37:57,025
But every one of our astronauts
is begging for the chance

676
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,578
to go after the Martians.

677
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:01,720
Who wouldn't give
everything to bring

678
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,522
Santa back to our children?

679
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:51,450

bounced off our ship.

He's such a funny little man.

Why, I've only been with
him for five minutes,

687

and he has me laughing
just like an Earthling.

and you put it on a stick,

689

and... and you toast it in
a fire, and it's green?

00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:21,460
Oh, you'll have a
wonderful dinner tonight.

713
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,785
Oh, there's soup, and beef
stew, and chocolate ice cream.

714
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:28,787
No thank you, Dropo.

715
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,028
I'm not hungry.

716
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,930
Come on, Billy.

717
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,712
Oh.

718
00:40:33,712 --> 00:40:36,605
Well, is it all right if I
have your chocolate ice cream?

719
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:37,866
Sure.

720
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:40,519
Oh, I just love
chocolate ice cream.

721
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,064
Kimar, look at this.

722
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:48,016
That small blip is
not an asteroid.

723
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:50,909
It's a spaceship, and it's
on our tail, getting closer.

724
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,601
Impossible, Rigna.

725
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:53,602
They couldn't have spotted us.

726
00:40:53,602 --> 00:40:55,083
We have our radar shield on.

727
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:58,096
I know that sir, but
they are gaining on us.

728
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,028
Is it possible Earth
has a secret device that

729
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:01,630
can penetrate our radar shield?

730
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,854
They have a secret device,
and his name is Billy Foster.

731
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,296
I warned you that these
Earthlings are dangerous.

732
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:11,139
They'll destroy us
if we allow them.

733
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:12,751
Well I won't allow them.

734
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:21,730
I think we underestimate
the resourcefulness

735
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,742
of these Earth people.

736
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,674
Very clever of the boy.

737
00:41:25,674 --> 00:41:27,415
Make the repairs, Rigna.

738
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:28,537
I'll take evasive action.

739
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:38,787
Well.

740
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:43,201
And how is Santa, and
the little Earthlings.

741
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:47,766
My, it must be tiresome
cooped up in this little room.

742
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:51,339
Say, how would you like to
see the rest of the ship?

743
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:52,561
You're not fooling me.

744
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,242
You don't like us.

745
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:56,084
You're mean.

746
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,465
Oh, come on now.

747
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,297
That's not true.

748
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:03,191
Why, Santa makes everyone
feel good, even me.

749
00:42:03,191 --> 00:42:04,843
I don't trust you.

750
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:06,895
Now, now, Billy boy.

751
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:09,287
That's not the Christmas spirit.

752
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:11,409
Why, of course, Voldar.

753
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:15,173
We'd love to take
the grand tour.

754
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:16,645
All right, children.

755
00:42:33,622 --> 00:42:34,663
This room is called...

756
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:35,513
Airlock.

757
00:42:35,513 --> 00:42:36,544
That's right.

758
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:37,375
Sure.

759
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,967
This is where you
come when you're

760
00:42:38,967 --> 00:42:40,629
ready to go out in space.

761
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:42,090
It's airtight.

762
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,004
You put on your space suit,
and go out through that door.

763
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,376
When you come back,
the door closes,

764
00:42:48,376 --> 00:42:51,670
and they pump air back into
the room through there.

765
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,232
When it reaches the pressure
of the rest of the ship,

766
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:56,044
you can take your
space suit off.

767
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:57,425
Smart lad.

768
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,188
Well, where's the control that
opens the door [INAUDIBLE]?

769
00:43:00,188 --> 00:43:01,189
Not here.

770
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:03,602
That's in the control deck.

771
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:06,104
You see, once you
pull that switch,

772
00:43:06,104 --> 00:43:09,988
the warning bell sounds, and
in 60 seconds, that door opens.

773
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,175
Santa, that clock stopped.

774
00:43:17,175 --> 00:43:18,386
60 seconds.

775
00:43:18,386 --> 00:43:19,597
That must be the door timer.

776
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:25,734
Santa, he locked us in.

777
00:43:25,734 --> 00:43:27,786
Oh, I don't think so.

778
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:31,299
He probably just stepped
out for a moment.

779
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:32,240
It's locked.

780
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,662
I don't trust Voldar.

781
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:35,553
He's not like Kimar
and the others.

782
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:37,455
I don't like him.

783
00:43:37,455 --> 00:43:38,566
I'm worried, Santa.

784
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,660
Now, now, children,
let's not get excited.

785
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,254
It's Voldar.

786
00:43:56,254 --> 00:43:59,798
He's going to open
the space door.

787
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:01,790
Help, Kimar!

788
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,580
Kimar!

789
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,281
Help!

790
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:23,631
Gee, Santa, what
are we going to do?

791
00:44:23,631 --> 00:44:25,623
Once that door opens,
we haven't got a chance.

792
00:44:29,097 --> 00:44:31,079
Eh.

793
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,431
Where'd you say this
leads to, Billy?

794
00:44:33,431 --> 00:44:46,204
VOLDAR: Seven six, five,
four, three, two, one, zero.

795
00:44:46,204 --> 00:44:47,716
Who's in the airlock?

796
00:44:47,716 --> 00:44:50,278
No one, now.

797
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:51,569
What's going on, Voldar?

798
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:56,184
Oh, Chief, Santa and
the children are missing.

799
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:59,577
Where are they?

800
00:44:59,577 --> 00:45:03,011
Drifting around in
space, along with the rest

801
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:04,222
of the space junk.

802
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:28,356
Before I'm through
with you, Voldar,

803
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:30,478
you'll wish you were floating
around out there in space.

804
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,280
[LAUGHING]

805
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,024
Merry Christmas, everyone.

806
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,565
Santa Claus, you're all right.

807
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:38,516
I... I thought you were...

808
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:42,570
Well, when Voldar accidentally
left in the airlock,

809
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,974
and then came up here and
accidentally threw the door

810
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:49,247
switch, we knew we had to
get out of there in a hurry,

811
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:53,431
or that would be the end of us...
Eh, accidentally, of course.

812
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:56,244
So we crawled up
through the air duct.

813
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:57,155
The air duct.

814
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:59,527
But the air duct
is just a little,

815
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:00,708
and... and you're so big.

816
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,541
[LAUGHING]

817
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,134
Well, you're talking
to Santa Claus, son.

818
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:09,948
KIMAR: But, how...

819
00:46:09,948 --> 00:46:13,081
Well, well now, you wouldn't
want me to tell my secret,

820
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:13,782
would you?

821
00:46:13,782 --> 00:46:16,144
[LAUGHING]

822
00:46:16,144 --> 00:46:19,137
Oh... oh, oh, poor man.

823
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:23,121
He's fainted, just like
someone who's seen a ghost.

824
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:43,071
KIMAR: Begin landing operation.

825
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,463
CREW: (SINGING) Jingle
bells, jingle bells,

826
00:46:45,463 --> 00:46:47,675
jingle all the way.

827
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:53,721
Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh.

828
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:54,943
Uh, Merry Christmas, Voldar.

829
00:46:54,943 --> 00:46:55,753
[MUFFLED SQUEAKING]

830
00:46:55,753 --> 00:46:59,537
All right, on your
feet, come on.

831
00:46:59,537 --> 00:47:00,238
Dropo!

832
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:03,982
Oh, whoa... I was handing him
food pills through the bars,

833
00:47:03,982 --> 00:47:05,223
and he grabbed my wrists...

834
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,044
Shut up, Dropo.

835
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:08,276
Kimar, come in quickly.

836
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:08,977
Kimar?

837
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:10,889
Yes, Rigna?

838
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:12,310
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Voldar has escaped.

839
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,251
What?

840
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:14,522
He's gone.

841
00:47:14,522 --> 00:47:16,264
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): That
can only mean trouble.

842
00:47:16,264 --> 00:47:19,527
Put a constant guard on
Santa and the Earth children.

843
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:20,468
Voldar will be back.

844
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:33,851
Oh, Kimar.

845
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,336
Are you alone?

846
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:39,037
No.

847
00:47:42,931 --> 00:47:43,631
MOMAR: Well.

848
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:48,086
KIMAR: Earthlings...
Billy and Betty.

849
00:47:48,086 --> 00:47:49,497
Welcome to our home.

850
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:54,943
There's someone else, too.

851
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:55,743
Oh?

852
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:56,444
Come on.

853
00:47:56,444 --> 00:47:57,435
Come on in.

854
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,742
Lady Momar.

855
00:48:04,742 --> 00:48:07,675
I'm not accustomed to
entering people's homes

856
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:12,310
through the door, but
you have no chimney.

857
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,601
Welcome, Santa Claus.

858
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:16,874
We hope you'll make the
children on Mars very happy.

859
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:18,816
I'll try, dear lady.

860
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:19,517
I'll try.

861
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,411
Where are they?

862
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:25,633
KIMAR: Well, we'll start
with my youngsters.

863
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:27,295
How are they, Momar?

864
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:28,036
MOMAR: The same.

865
00:48:28,036 --> 00:48:30,548
Quiet, remote, and very unhappy.

866
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:31,799
They're inside, studying.

867
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:35,153
Well, let old Santa
say hello to them.

868
00:48:35,153 --> 00:48:38,336
And I'm sure these children
would like to meet them.

869
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:41,479
I'll tell them you're here.

COMPUTER: Y over 5 pi r squared
to determine the correct orbit

00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:56,734
A through the 17th quadrant
at the power of 12 megatrons.

00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:57,695
Father!

874
00:48:57,695 --> 00:49:00,588
Father, we missed you.

875
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:02,890
I missed you, too.

876
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:09,187
Children, I brought some
visitors from Earth.

877
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:10,498
Will you come in
please, children?

878
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:19,067
Billy and Betty, this
is Bomar and Girmar.

879
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:19,767
Hi.

880
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,283
There's nothing in it.

881
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:27,225
What are you giving me?

882
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:28,636
My hand, to shake.

883
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:37,915
How old are you?

884
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:38,886
10.

885
00:49:38,886 --> 00:49:39,977
I'm 10, too.

886
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,309
And Girmar's eight.

887
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:44,002
So is my sister.

888
00:49:44,002 --> 00:49:46,614
We have another Earth
person that wants to see you.

889
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:24,092
What's that?

890
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:28,956
They're laughing.

891
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:31,269
Bomar and Girmar, too.

892
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:33,501
They've never laughed before.

893
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:34,202
Come.

894
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:50,898
I can't believe it.

895
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,570
That's the first time
in months they've

896
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:54,602
gone to sleep without
the sleep spray.

897
00:50:54,602 --> 00:50:58,336
Santa, tomorrow we'll
set up a workshop for you.

898
00:50:58,336 --> 00:51:01,028
It won't be exactly the same
as the one you have on Earth,

899
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:03,161
but I'm sure it'll
serve your purpose.

900
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:04,402
Good, good.

901
00:51:04,402 --> 00:51:08,136
Now, I'd like to get going and
have the toy shop operating

902
00:51:08,136 --> 00:51:12,390
full blast, so as I can
return to Earth for Christmas.

903
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:17,275
You know, Mrs. Claus is a
very good-natured woman, but...

904
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:20,298
Santa Claus, you will
never return to Earth.

905
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:20,998
Wha...

906
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:27,285
Now you belong to Mars.

907
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:30,077
Ho, ho, ho.

908
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:31,099
Well, we've no time to lose.

909
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:32,870
We must go into action.

910
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,702
Now we cannot
eliminate Santa Claus,

911
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:37,235
but we can just
discredit him, make him

912
00:51:37,235 --> 00:51:38,866
a laughingstock throughout Mars.

913
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:39,567
Come on.

914
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,969
Now listen, carefully.

915
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,621
That workshop closes
at 10 o'clock.

916
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,754
The guards will be at Kimar's
house, guarding Santa Claus.

917
00:51:46,754 --> 00:51:48,516
Now this is what we'll do, see?

918
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:50,118
You take...

919
00:51:50,118 --> 00:51:51,529
Two dolls.

920
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:52,710
Two dolls.

921
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,411
Yes, Betty.

922
00:51:59,277 --> 00:52:01,229
BETTY: Three baseball bats.

923
00:52:01,229 --> 00:52:03,471
Three baseball bats.

924
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:16,164
Look at me, Santa Claus,
the great toymaker,

925
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:17,685
pressing buttons.

926
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:20,248
That's automation for you.

927
00:52:20,248 --> 00:52:24,362
Technology, oi.

928
00:52:24,362 --> 00:52:26,354
Well, that's enough for today.

929
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:33,140
Let's close up shop!

930
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,891
OK, Santa.

931
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:34,592
OK, Santa.

932
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:37,505
Boy, we sure did a lot today.

933
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:41,549
SANTA CLAUS: Yes, well, there's
another day gone, children.

934
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:45,122
As they say on Earth,
another day, another dollar.

935
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:47,665
Well, hello, Santa.

936
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:48,896
How are you feeling today?

937
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:49,797
Tired?

938
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:50,898
No, no.

939
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:52,380
I'm not tired.

940
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,151
But my finger is.

941
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:57,134
It's been pressing
buttons all day long.

942
00:52:59,737 --> 00:53:03,961
Well, I think I'll go in
and put my finger to bed.

943
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:04,662
Here, children.

944
00:53:04,662 --> 00:53:05,633
Here's your milk.

945
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:07,114
You can play for half
an hour, and then

946
00:53:07,114 --> 00:53:08,446
you'll have to go to bed.

947
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:11,219
Daddy, may we watch
the Earth program?

948
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:12,460
Certainly, dear.

949
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,801
But only for half an hour.

950
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:19,217
Billy?

951
00:53:19,217 --> 00:53:20,808
Betty?

952
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:22,650
Don't you want to watch
the Earth programs?

953
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,432
Oh, no sir.

954
00:53:24,432 --> 00:53:27,104
We're not interested
in Earth programs.

955
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,306
I'm going to sleep.

956
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,237
Goodnight.

957
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:30,037
Me, too.

958
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:30,788
Just a moment.

959
00:53:30,788 --> 00:53:31,529
Goodnight, Mr. Kimar.

960
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:33,731
Goodnight, Lady Momar.

961
00:53:33,731 --> 00:53:36,754
Just a moment, children.

962
00:53:36,754 --> 00:53:38,456
Are you feeling well?

963
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:40,187
Oh, we feel fine, sir.

964
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:41,609
Goodnight.

965
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:42,420
Goodnight.

966
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,273
KIMAR: Has someone
been mistreating you?

967
00:53:45,273 --> 00:53:46,764
Oh, no sir.

968
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:49,387
You and Lady Momar have
just been swell to us.

969
00:53:49,387 --> 00:53:50,087
Goodnight.

970
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:56,454
What could it be, Momar?

971
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:59,367
They're behaving the way
our children used to behave.

972
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:01,289
Can't you tell, Kimar?

973
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:03,321
They're homesick.

974
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:07,034
They miss their
parents, their friends.

975
00:54:07,034 --> 00:54:09,006
Kimar, you've got to
send those children back.

976
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:13,411
Impossible.

977
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:41,759
Oh, now I'm Santa Claus.

978
00:54:41,759 --> 00:54:45,092
Ho, ho, ho.

979
00:54:45,092 --> 00:54:46,714
Ho, ho, ho.

980
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:49,767
Merry Christmas everyone!

981
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:52,450
Ho, ho, ho.

982
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,981
My finger isn't tired.

983
00:54:53,981 --> 00:54:55,873
I think I'll go
down to the workshop

984
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:57,395
and make some more toys.

985
00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:00,247
Ho, ho, ho. (SINGING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

986
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,169
jingle all the way.

987
00:55:02,169 --> 00:55:07,935
[HUMMING]

988
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:11,669
VOLDAR: Shim, pull the light.

989
00:55:11,669 --> 00:55:12,480
No, the light.

990
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:19,807
Oh, ah, this is
going shake 'em up.

991
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,219
These toys will never
be the same again.

992
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:25,603
Shh!

993
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:26,303
Shh!

994
00:55:26,303 --> 00:55:28,996
Shh!

995
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:29,827
Someone's coming.

996
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,268
Quick, down.

997
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:34,662
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

998
00:55:34,662 --> 00:55:39,517
Oh what fun it is to ride the
one horse open sleigh, hey.

999
00:55:39,517 --> 00:55:41,208
What a break.

1000
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:43,160
It's Santa Claus.

1001
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,472
He's alone.

1002
00:55:44,472 --> 00:55:46,824
No guards.

1003
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:50,297
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

1004
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:54,261
Oh what fun it is to
ride... oh, oh, oh.

1005
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:06,984
Now stay put, my
fat little friend.

1006
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:08,386
Hey, Santa.

1007
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:09,497
How do you like this toy?

1008
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:11,929
Ho, ho, ho.

1009
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:13,781
My friend asked you a question.

1010
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:14,762
Answer him.

1011
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:16,233
Ho, ho, ho.

1012
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:17,214
Quiet, Shim.

1013
00:56:17,214 --> 00:56:19,166
Put on a nuclear curtain.

1014
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:28,696
Tomorrow marks the end
of Operation Santa Claus.

1015
00:56:28,696 --> 00:56:30,908
And Mars returns to normal.

1016
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:38,746
Dropo, we're here.

1017
00:56:38,746 --> 00:56:40,528
He's hiding, Santa.

1018
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:43,190
Oh, playing hide and seek, eh?

1019
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,843
All right, Dropo.

1020
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:49,196
Here we come, ready or not.

1021
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:56,213
He's not here, Santa.

1022
00:56:56,213 --> 00:56:57,555
That's funny.

1023
00:56:57,555 --> 00:56:59,366
Oh, well, he'll turn up.

1024
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:00,067
Let's get started.

1025
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,233
Hey, ho!

1026
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:07,164
Ready?

1027
00:57:07,164 --> 00:57:09,036
OK.

1028
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:10,427
Let's go.

1029
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,820
One teddy bear and one doll.

1030
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,664
One teddy bear and one doll.

1031
00:57:20,558 --> 00:57:22,510
Santa, stop the machine!

1032
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,491
Look!

1033
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:25,432
The doll has a
teddy bear's head,

1034
00:57:25,432 --> 00:57:28,846
and the teddy bear
has a doll's head.

1035
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,307
I can't understand it.

1036
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:32,409
Oh, let's try it again.

1037
00:57:32,409 --> 00:57:34,091
What's next, Betty?

1038
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,543
One baseball bat.

1039
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:43,851
SANTA CLAUS: A baseball tennis...
Why, this will never do.

1040
00:57:43,851 --> 00:57:45,883
The machine isn't working right.

1041
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:46,724
Oh, dear.

1042
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:48,155
What else, Betty?

1043
00:57:48,155 --> 00:57:50,117
A toy train.

1044
00:57:50,117 --> 00:57:51,318
A toy train.

1045
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:52,079
Well, all right.

1046
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:52,780
Yes.

1047
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:59,106
Look at that.

1048
00:57:59,106 --> 00:58:02,309
Wha... Why, this
doesn't make sense.

1049
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:11,499
Well, this never happened
when we made toys by hand.

1050
00:58:11,499 --> 00:58:17,364
Something very strange
is happening here.

1051
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:21,098
Bomar, I think you'd
better call your father.

1052
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:25,903
Father?

1053
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:26,964
Father, this is Bomar.

1054
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:28,746
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): Yes, Bomar?

1055
00:58:28,746 --> 00:58:30,968
Father, we're in the toy shop.

1056
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:32,980
Dropo was in here,
and there's something

1057
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,552
wrong with the toy machine, too.

1058
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,684
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM):
I'll be right over.

1059
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:38,085
Just a word of warning.

1060
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:41,068
If you got any big
ideas, forget them.

1061
00:58:41,068 --> 00:58:42,740
If you walk through
that nuclear curtain,

1062
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,172
you'll be disintegrated
like that.

1063
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,076
Sabotage Somebody
switched all our wiring.

1064
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:00,137
Dropo's gone.

1065
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,879
Your suit is missing.

1066
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:05,643
And now, this machine's
been sabotaged.

1067
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:08,145
Put them all together,
it spells Voldar.

1068
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:12,610
He was here, and he
thought Dropo was me.

1069
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,431
He's got Dropo.

1070
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:17,024
And I've got to find him.

1071
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,325
Poor Dropo.

1072
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,672
Surprised to see us?

1073
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:25,643
You're under arrest, Voldar.

1074
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,038
Stop playing with toys.

1075
00:59:31,038 --> 00:59:32,770
Put it away, Kimar.

1076
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:35,943
We have a weapon that's
much more potent than that.

1077
00:59:35,943 --> 00:59:39,226
As you may know, we are
holding Santa Claus a hostage.

1078
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,620
One false move, and your
little ho, ho, ho man

1079
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,702
will be destroyed.

1080
00:59:44,702 --> 00:59:45,402
All right.

1081
00:59:45,402 --> 00:59:46,604
What do you want, Voldar?

1082
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:49,967
These are our terms.

1083
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:52,710
First, destroy the toy machine.

1084
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,882
Second, we will
release Santa Claus

1085
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,054
if you promise to send
him and the Earthlings

1086
00:59:57,054 --> 00:59:58,355
back to their planet.

1087
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:03,040
Third, no more joy through
toys nonsense on Mars.

1088
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,121
Well?

1089
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:06,143
Well, you win.

1090
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,101
Are you sure you
have Santa Claus?

1091
01:00:14,101 --> 01:00:16,053
VOLDAR: You know we have him.

1092
01:00:16,053 --> 01:00:17,995
You mean you had him.

1093
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,522
How did he get out of the cave?

1094
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:26,954
Shim, that idiot!

1095
01:00:26,954 --> 01:00:29,817
A-a-and how'd he
get here s-s-so fast?

1096
01:00:29,817 --> 01:00:31,498
Santa Claus has powers
that you don't know about.

1097
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:32,199
All right.

1098
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,751
Arms up.

1099
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,342
Rigna, Hargo, Lomas, report.

1100
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:36,744
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
This is Rigna, Kimar.

1101
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:38,796
Hargo and Lomas are with me.

1102
01:00:38,796 --> 01:00:39,636
Good.

1103
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,478
I've got Voldar and Stobo.

1104
01:00:41,478 --> 01:00:44,321
I'll keep them here in the
storeroom of the toy shop.

1105
01:00:44,321 --> 01:00:46,343
Rigna, you come here and
take them off my hands.

1106
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,386
I want Hargo and Lomas to
look for a man named Shim.

1107
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:51,999
Tell them to search the caves
along the Transverse Canal.

1108
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:53,130
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Right, Kimar.

1109
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:54,802
All right, you two.

1110
01:00:54,802 --> 01:00:55,502
In there.

1111
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,592
All right, you
might as well relax.

1112
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:06,824
You're going to be
here for a while.

1113
01:01:06,824 --> 01:01:07,524
Sit down.

1114
01:01:39,606 --> 01:01:40,587
SHIM: Where are you going?

1115
01:01:40,587 --> 01:01:42,569
Ho, ho, ho.

1116
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:46,033
Can't you say anything
else but ho, ho, ho?

1117
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,135
DROPO: Ho, ho, ho.

1118
01:01:48,135 --> 01:01:51,869
If you're thinking of leaving,
Santa, let me remind you.

1119
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:54,281
Once you hit that
nuclear curtain,

1120
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:55,963
there won't even
be a whisker left.

1121
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,235
Ho, ho, ho.

1122
01:01:58,235 --> 01:01:59,226
SHIM: Hey, Santa!

1123
01:01:59,226 --> 01:02:00,227
Be careful!

1124
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:11,809
What are you going
to do with us?

1125
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:13,801
You're going to stand
trial before the council.

1126
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:15,672
I don't think you'll be
causing any more trouble.

1127
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:33,590
Well now, I think that
should do it, Billy boy.

1128
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,763
Close the door, son.

1129
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:38,205
Now, I think we need
a little red paint.

1130
01:02:38,205 --> 01:02:40,878
And you'll find it
in the storeroom.

1131
01:02:40,878 --> 01:02:41,819
Sure, Santa.

1132
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:42,519
Yes.

1133
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:43,330
That's a good boy.

1134
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:50,367
VOLDAR: This time I'll take
care of Santa Claus for good,

1135
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,921
and smash that machine.

1136
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:54,882
Santa!

1137
01:02:54,882 --> 01:02:56,323
Santa!

1138
01:02:56,323 --> 01:02:58,305
Voldar and the other man
are in the storeroom,

1139
01:02:58,305 --> 01:02:59,536
and they're coming to get you.

1140
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:01,809
Oh, they are, are they?

1141
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:07,034
Yeh... well, maybe they'd like
to have some fun with our toys,

1142
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:09,246
and we'll see that they do.

1143
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:10,337
Won't we kids.

1144
01:03:21,618 --> 01:03:23,931
Oh-ho, we meet again, eh?

1145
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:28,765
I don't know how you escaped
Shim, but you won't escape me.

1146
01:03:28,765 --> 01:03:29,546
You're through.

1147
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:32,019
Voldar, why don't
you, uh, relax?

1148
01:03:34,531 --> 01:03:36,954
You're going to
relax... permanently.

1149
01:04:55,202 --> 01:04:56,203
You?

1150
01:04:56,203 --> 01:04:57,694
Wha... but, you're not here.

1151
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:59,686
You're in there.

1152
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:01,178
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1153
01:05:01,178 --> 01:05:02,169
I'm not here.

1154
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:04,161
I'm in there.

1155
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:05,702
Wait a minute.

1156
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:07,884
I'm going to see who
Voldar's fighting in there.

1157
01:05:11,768 --> 01:05:14,191
What happened?

1158
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,613
I don't know what's
going on in there,

1159
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,545
but I'm going to take
care of you myself.

1160
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:19,997
Now... now, just a minute.

1161
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:22,699
Now I'd like to
talk to... Oh, boy,

1162
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:25,372
Chief, am I glad to see you.

1163
01:05:25,372 --> 01:05:26,753
All right, inside, Stobo.

1164
01:05:30,747 --> 01:05:32,749
All right, kids,
you can stop now.

1165
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:37,744
I said cease fire.

1166
01:05:47,374 --> 01:05:48,075
All right, Rigna.

1167
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:48,775
Take them away.

1168
01:05:48,775 --> 01:05:49,606
They've had a rough day.

1169
01:05:57,714 --> 01:06:00,077
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.

1170
01:06:00,077 --> 01:06:02,049
Merry Christmas!

1171
01:06:05,512 --> 01:06:07,764
You don't need me here, Kimar.

1172
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:12,839
You've got a wonderful
Santa Claus of your own.

1173
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:14,341
Ho, ho, ho!

1174
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:20,007
Goodbye, Billy.

1175
01:06:20,007 --> 01:06:21,048
Goodbye.

1176
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:24,621
Goodbye, Betty dear.

1177
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:26,953
You take care of yourself.

1178
01:06:26,953 --> 01:06:28,825
Bye.

1179
01:06:28,825 --> 01:06:30,727
I've got something
for you, Billy.

1180
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:32,529
Gee, thanks.

1181
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:33,500
Goodbye.

1182
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,801
Bye.

1183
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:35,942
Gee, we had fun.

1184
01:06:35,942 --> 01:06:37,654
We're going to miss you.

1185
01:06:37,654 --> 01:06:39,846
Do you think we'll
ever meet again?

1186
01:06:39,846 --> 01:06:42,129
I'm sure you will, children.

1187
01:06:42,129 --> 01:06:44,081
Thank you, Santa, for
bringing happiness

1188
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:45,532
to the children of Mars.

1189
01:06:45,532 --> 01:06:47,994
And the Christmas
spirit to all of us.

1190
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:51,628
Son, from the
bottom of my heart,

1191
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:58,014
I wish you and yours the
very best of everything.

1192
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,046
Ho, ho, ho!

1193
01:06:59,046 --> 01:07:02,749
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1194
01:07:02,749 --> 01:07:04,491
Dropo Claus is here.

1195
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:07,694
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

1196
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:11,458
Dropo, you put on weight.

1197
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:12,549
Oh, yes.

1198
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:14,000
No pillows, look.

1199
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,212
Look kids, no pillows.

1200
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:28,345
Now, if we hurry, we can get
back in time for Christmas Eve.

1201
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,237
KIDS: Yay!

1202
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:33,800
Shall we get going?

1203
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,792
KIDS: Yay!

1204
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:37,794
Goodbye, dear friends.

1205
01:07:37,794 --> 01:07:38,495
Away!

1206
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:47,924
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1207
01:07:47,924 --> 01:07:49,926
Away!

1208
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:50,917
MARTIANS: Bye!

1209
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:52,419
Goodbye, Santa Claus!

1210
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:53,910
Goodbye!
