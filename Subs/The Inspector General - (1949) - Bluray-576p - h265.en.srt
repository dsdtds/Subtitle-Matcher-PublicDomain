00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,528
- I have to see the Mayor.
- He's in a council meeting and he
can't be disturbed.

3
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,709
- I demand that you let me through.
- I've ridden all night, 80 miles.
That's the orders.

4
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:43,896
Get out of my way.

5
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:47,077
Stop! I said STOP!

6
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:52,245
- I must see the Mayor.
- But the Mayor is in council meetings.

7
00:01:52,643 --> 00:01:56,817
- Let go of me. You'll be sorry, I'm a
relavtive of the Mayor's.
- So am I, so is the whole council.

8
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:01,390
Where's the council room? Cousin Bryo.

9
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:05,763
- Stop making so much noise,
they're in a meeting.
- What is all this commotion?

10
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:08,546
Counsin Gregor, cousin Bryo.

11
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,510
- This is my cousin, the Mayor of Trebin.
- I'm sorry, this man he tried to...

12
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:18,088
- Come in here.
- Counsin Gregor.

13
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:23,058
- I've been riding all night. It's a disaster.
- Come and sit down. Fetch brandy and water.

14
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:26,636
- No water...
- Come on, tell what's happened. Speak up.

15
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:31,407
Like thunder, he appeared among us.
The postmaster was hanged, and the
chief of police was let off with 200 lashes.

16
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:36,576
I was sentenced to the firing squad.
Lucky for me, the rifles blew up and I escaped.

17
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:41,347
- I need a fresh horse. I must be off at once.
- A fresh horse for our cousin.
Sit down, sit down.

18
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,527
- I must go. Even now, he may be
here in your midst. - Who?

19
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,503
- Speak up man, who?
- The Inspector General.

20
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:55,262
Yes, he has full power from the Emporer himself.
And where ever he finds bribery and coruption,
that's where the gallows and firing squads go to work.

21
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,636
- More!
- What does he look like, this Inspector General?

22
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:04,009
Who knows? A man of mystery.
Five days he was in our midst and
no one even suspected it.

23
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,389
He went everywhere, saw
everything and uncovered such
coruption that even I was shocked.

24
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:13,154
- Now don't get excited.
- Don't get excited! How I envy
you, secure in your clean town and fear no one.

25
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,726
- The horse is ready, Uncle Byro.
I must be off.
- Oh Gregor, where will you go?

26
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:21,702
Far away anywhere, Africa, China...
Good-bye cousin Byro.

27
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,485
Farewell Uncle.

28
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,467
Good-bye cousin.

29
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:33,430
Do you need any money?
I have a few crowns.

30
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,201
Thank-you.

31
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,984
City Funds.

32
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,569
Farewell.

33
00:03:57,484 --> 00:04:02,056
I would like to take this opportunity
to tend to my resignation.

34
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:08,020
SIT DOWN! What would you do?
Go back to rolling pills in that stink
shop of a chemist?

35
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:15,773
- I promised my wife...
- I have to talk to my sister...

36
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,993
STAY WHERE YOU ARE! Nothing
is to be gained by rushing around blindly.

37
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,167
We must proceed according to
system. You Lazlo, clean up the square.

38
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:34,465
You Toleki. Get the children back
into school. Start teaching them
something, anything.

39
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:37,845
You two deliver the mail, all of it,
whether you've read it or not.

40
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:41,224
- I never read the mail.
- Yes you did, don't you remember?

41
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:47,983
Kovak, come back here.

42
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:53,748
I want all roads policed day and night.
I want a report of everyone
who's entered this town in the past 24 hours.

43
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:58,238
Check the tavern. Lnvestigate all
strangers. Bring your reports to me
personally, do you understand?

44
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:03,407
- es, but first I would like to...
- First you will obey orders. Now
get out of here.

45
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:08,376
Thank-you.

46
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:21,051
Order double guards at the city
gates and patrol all roads to Brodny at once.

47
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,559
AT ONCE!

48
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,522
- Come with me.
- What goes with Uncle General?

49
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,908
I said come with me.

50
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:38,667
- Anything wrong.
- Quiet.

51
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,835
Quiet you.

52
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:58,336
I shall investigate here. You men
go on to the next town.

53
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:16,323
Countrymen approach. Step up,
step up. Come close for the
greatest experience of your life.

54
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,305
You will tell your children and
grandchildren about this.

55
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:25,468
First you will be entertained by the
greatest musicians in the country
right from the court of the Emporer.

56
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:31,630
Yakov's exlixsir, the best that can
be had. Yakov's elixsir is good for
what is bad.

57
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:46,522
Now my good people, step closer
so that you may see with your own eyes.

58
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,293
I Yakov Guli, positioned to Princes
and crown heads come among you to...

59
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:58,449
exhibit absolutely free of charge the
wonder of the world and parellel
since the dawn of time.

60
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:06,202
Are you ready my friends? The
Egyptian marvel, the treasure of the
Pharohs. Behold!

61
00:07:10,178 --> 00:07:15,546
- tep right up people. Examine, observe.
- You there! Who are you? Let me
see your peddlar card.

62
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:21,708
Here you go Captain. Yakov Guli.
An honest professional man from Pribirk.
I have testimonials from the Emporer himself.

63
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:25,883
- Never mind.
- What about your friend there?
Who him?

64
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:33,834
Captain, don't run away, come
back. We welcome all investigations.

65
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,611
Look my friends. It lives, it breathes.

66
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,184
It laughs, it cries, it thinks.

67
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,557
Watch his left ear. How much is 2 + 2?

68
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:54,606
Correct! This is not just an old
head. This is Prince Ahmed of ancient Egypt.

69
00:07:54,805 --> 00:08:00,769
Beheaded by the cruel Pharoh,
because of his forbidden love for
the crown Princess.

70
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:07,329
And now my friends you ask
yourselves, How has this miracle
survived for over 2000 years?

71
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:13,889
An excellent question. Only this.
Yakov's Golden Elixsir.

72
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:18,263
Look how his eyes plead with me to
give him a dose of my elixsir.

73
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,040
He really yearns for its richness.

74
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:30,985
I am a simple man my friends. I do
not make extravagant claims for my medicine.

75
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:34,365
If a person is already dead, for instance...

76
00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:37,943
there is only a slim chance that my
medicine will do him any good.

77
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:41,720
But if only a spark of life remains...

78
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:47,485
Yakov's Golden Elixsir will fan it into
a roaring fire of health.

79
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:04,979
How can Yakov cheat those poor people
like that? Why what's the matter? Well
this is the furniture polish he sold yesterday?

80
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,364
Come on, hurry up. He's almost through.

81
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:13,527
- No, you don't wear this.
- Here is the testimonials from my
grateful customers.

82
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:18,894
Even from the great Napoleon
himself, written on the battlefield of Austerlitz.

83
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:22,075
He gives the elixsir full credit for the victory.

84
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:25,454
For years I've suffered terrible
digestive depress."

85
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:30,822
However since taking Yakov's
mircle elilxsir, I no longer find it
necessary to...

86
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,406
continuously hold my hand on my
stomach."

87
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,786
Kindest personal regards:
Napoleon."

88
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:48,514
But why do I tell you these things
my friends when there is someone here...

89
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:53,882
a sufferer on whom I've looked with
compassion when he lay on death's door.

90
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,056
Unable to move a muscle.
Paralyzed!

91
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:06,008
Friend, are you aware that you are
losing your hair?

92
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,978
Do you need money? Have you
been on a diet?

93
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:18,333
Are you bothered by quiet?
Quiet... QUIET!

94
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,514
Nice dancer that fellow.

95
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:28,869
Do you get colds, or prickly heat, a
burning brow, blazing feet, a
leaping pulse...

96
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:33,839
or Hic-cups? Do you get Hic-cup?

97
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:40,399
A touch of laryngitis, asthama, or
appendincitis, or hic-cups...

98
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:44,971
or hic... cups.

99
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:53,122
Or measles, a diagnosis of
phycosis...

100
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:57,893
Have you ever been short of breath?

101
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,061
Well, cheer up, cheer up, cheer up.

102
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:05,986
No matter how bad your condition.
I have news that will tickle your ears.

103
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,804
- I was dead.
- Dead?

104
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,786
Well, pretty sick.

105
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:18,359
Til I saw a famous physician, who
hadn't seen a patient in years.

106
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:21,539
He was near-sighted.

107
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:26,111
He said, hello young man, you are
possibly the plumber.

108
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:31,280
I'm a patient Dr. Hummer. Dr.
Hummer said, hhhhmmmmmm.

109
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:41,617
Dr. Hummer said hmmmmm, with a
C. Dr. Cinger. Dr. Cinger said
aaaaaahhh.

110
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,744
You have something with your nose
and something with your sneezes.
Tell me young man.

111
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:57,918
You've had some diseases? Have I had...

112
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:03,484
When I was one I had a...

113
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:06,267
When I was two I had a..

114
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,051
When I was three I had..

115
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:12,231
By the time I was four...

116
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:16,207
When I was six I had a...

117
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:19,388
At seven I developed...

118
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,767
When I was eight I got a...

119
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:26,345
By the time I was nine...

120
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:32,309
Doctor, why am I always so tired?

121
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:38,869
Doctor Cinger said
aaaaaaaaahhhhh.

122
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,243
And gave me the following
perscription.

123
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:55,767
Zalaminhalticnol, twice a day.

124
00:12:57,357 --> 00:13:03,520
Since that day I haven't been sick
sir. And that medicine did the trick
sir. What was it, don't ask me.

125
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:07,937
I'll tell you.

126
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:17,280
Yakov's Golden Elixsir.

127
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:33,184
Come my friends. Who will be the
first to buy Yakov's Elixsir?

128
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:41,135
I have 12 pennies. My husband is
sick. Maybe if he had your
medicine, he'd get well.

129
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:45,111
Go away please. Will you take one here?

130
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,677
Sell it to her. Why, I did very well I
sold three. Ooooohhhh.

131
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:57,204
Here you go mother. What ever is
wrong with your husband, he is now cured.

132
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,770
All right ladies and gentlemen, here
it is. The most wonderful, the most
miraclous all cure. The Golden Elixsir.

133
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:06,150
- Mother, I'll give you your pennies,
give me back the medicine. - No!

134
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,921
- The medicine is no good.
- It's for my husband. He needs it, he's sick.

135
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,891
I know and this will fi nish him off.
Take the pennies and buy milk. It
will be better than the medicine.

136
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,065
Do you remember me? I'm the
fellow with all the diseases, but
there is nothing wrong with me.

137
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:23,445
The medicine is a fake, I'm a fake,
Yakov is a fake.

138
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:28,017
This is no good. I tell you mother, we are
cheating all the people, don't you see?
We wash windows with it, furniture polish.

139
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:31,993
All the people. Pardon me. All the
people back there.

140
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,161
Yakov!

141
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,769
Yakov... Yakov!

142
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:13,540
Georgi... Georgi!

143
00:15:47,878 --> 00:15:49,667
You...

144
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:07,170
Look Yakov, a fish.

145
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:11,941
We can have supper now. Put it
near the flame.

146
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,917
- It's mine Yakov.
- It's mine now. Yeah, but I caught it.
I took it.

147
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:19,893
When you learn a little more about
taking and a little less about giving,
you can come back.

148
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,260
- I'm sorry about that poor old woman.
- Being sentimental is not good.

149
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:31,025
In this life it's dog eat dog. Bite and
scratch. Grab everything for
yourself and hold on like a leech.

150
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,796
- You can't even pick a pocket.
- Yes I can so do it.

151
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,375
I'm a good thief Yakov. Even better
than you, see?

152
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:44,146
- That's my watch.
- When did you get it? In the water.

153
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,519
Please Yakov don't send me off. I'll
do anything you want. I'll be hard as nails.

154
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,290
- I'll steal my own mother's teeth.
- I'll believe it when I see it, get out.

155
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:57,663
Oh all right, I'll go.

156
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:02,434
- Right after supper.
- You get out of here.

157
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:06,808
- Why you iliterate numbskull you.
- I'm not iliterate!

158
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:12,374
You're not huh? Read that.

159
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,555
- Read it?
- Read it!

160
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:23,308
- Who can read on am empty stomach?
- Read it and I'll give you supper.

161
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:26,488
It's say ah, ah.

162
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:30,663
Oh this is very interesting. Your
handwriting shows defi nite
character, it shows...

163
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:34,241
your generous and wouldn't refuse
a hungry man...

164
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:39,807
- Read it!
- It says, dear sir.

165
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:44,976
- It says, "To whom it may concern".
- That's right, I was testing you.

166
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:56,108
Best personal regards, Napoleon.
Here you are.

167
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:04,060
- Maybe I can't read or write, but I'm not iliterate.
- You're nothing just a mill stone, get
out of here.

168
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,837
- GET OUT!
- Good-bye Yakov.

169
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:19,367
To Whom It May Concern. What a
silly way to start a letter.

170
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,963
To Whom It May Concern. What a
silly way to start a letter.

171
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:43,448
The sailor loves the sea when the
wind blows fair.

172
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:47,225
The Arab loves the desert and the
sand which is there. The Farmer.

173
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,008
Sandwiches...

174
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:18,237
- Go get it.
- Oh, just the bottom of the barrel.

175
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:22,412
What do you want?

176
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:27,978
I thought you men wouldn't mind
sharing a little of your food with a...

177
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,954
- On your way you tramp. We
hardly got enough for ourselves.
- Go on, get on your way.

178
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:40,502
- Well you just gave a little piece to the dog.
- The dog does something for his food.

179
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:43,484
What'd I tell you. Go on. Go away.

180
00:20:56,803 --> 00:21:00,580
- Oh he's moody.
- If I could just have a little piece.

181
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:03,451
Wait a minute. Otto, come here.
Roll over.

182
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:12,069
- Can you do that? Could I have a little piece?
- Can you do that?

183
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:16,045
Roll over? Let's
see you do that.

184
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,611
Hurry up. Lie down, lie down.

185
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:30,358
Wait a minute. I bet he can run
faster than you can.

186
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:53,219
No thanks Otto. You won it fair and
square.

187
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,996
A bargain is a bargain.

188
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,856
Any good?

189
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:29,217
Would you mind if I tasted a few?
I haven't had anything to eat in a
couple of days.

190
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:34,585
I appreciate this. Thank-you very much.

191
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,922
Don't put that heavy stuff on top of
the crystal. Where's the wagon?

192
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:51,681
- Now please go back.
- Stop thief! Go get him.

193
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,253
- Stop that thief. Is there somebody
over there that can stop that thief?
- I caught you, you thief!

194
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:01,223
Who me? You have the wrong
person. The horse followed me, I'm innocent.

195
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:06,603
Then you'll hang with a clear conscience.
Take him to jail. Take him away.

196
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:10,579
Hold it, hold it. I'm innocent. Stop!
Ask the horse, I'm innocent.

197
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,975
Gentlemen.

198
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:21,734
- To business. Gizzy or is it Izzy?
- I'm Izzy uncle.

199
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:27,300
- You can always tell by the strawberry mark.
- Never mind. The hospital, have
you cleaned it up?

200
00:24:27,697 --> 00:24:30,679
We cleaned up the floor, put sheets
on the bed and got the goats out of surgery.

201
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:34,257
And I put charts on each of the
patients beds, indicating the nature
of their illness.

202
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,438
Good, at least now they'll know
what they die from. Kovach...

203
00:24:37,836 --> 00:24:40,818
Well, I've patrolled all the roads
leading to and from Brodny.

204
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:47,775
So unless the Inspector General decides
to disguise himself like a bird and fly
into the city, he'll never get past me.

205
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:52,546
- Good. And the jail?
- I've had new locks fitted to all the
cells, burned all the rubbish.

206
00:24:52,745 --> 00:24:56,522
- I even have a prisoner.
- Good, who is he?

207
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,498
Oh I don't know, just a tramp.
I apprehended him in the city square.

208
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:04,275
He was trying to make off with a
horse and wagon, the one we were
loading with silver.

209
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:08,847
- My silver? My valuables?
- Yes, but I got him before he...

210
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:13,817
- Who is he? Where did he come from?
- Oh I don't know he's just...

211
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,594
a common tramp. Dressed in rags.

212
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:31,112
You idiot! Did you cite him,
question him?

213
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,684
It was so near lunch time and he
was just a common tramp.

214
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:41,052
The Inspector General? Well that's
ridiculous.

215
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:46,220
Why not a tramp? In Falsburg he
appeared as a travelling shoe salesman.

216
00:25:46,618 --> 00:25:50,991
In Clamatti he was disguised as a
peddler. And here, why not a tramp?

217
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:55,365
My horse and wagon. The wagon I
loaded with valuables to ship out of town.

218
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,744
Of course, the evidence he needed.
Now he knows.

219
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:03,316
- I would like to take this opportunity
to tender my resignation.
- To the jail.

220
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,069
Who's there?

221
00:26:26,774 --> 00:26:30,750
- Want some water? Water?
- I want some food.

222
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:37,509
- I'm sorry. The prisoners are fed
promptly at 3 o'clock.
- I guess I can hold out til then.

223
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:43,472
- Wednesday and Saturday.
- But today is Thursday.

224
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:49,237
- What is time?
- Look I haven't eaten in two days.

225
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:55,599
What kind of jail is this where they
won't even give a man a crust of
bread. All I want is a little piece of food there.

226
00:26:56,195 --> 00:27:01,761
This is a nice jail. Really it is.
We've had some nice hangings here.

227
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,924
- What's nice about the hanging?
- Oh, you should see the ceremony.

228
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:11,900
- And the last meal.
- The last meal?

229
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:23,231
The Mayor and all the commissionaires
come dressed in their finest clothes.

230
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:26,610
And the town band assemblies at
the door of the jail.

231
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:31,183
Such beautiful music. And they
play the prisoner right up to the gallows.

232
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,562
- I'll never forget one hanging we
had a few years ago. - What's that?

233
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:37,941
- What's what?
- What's that music?

234
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:52,652
- What were you arrested for?
- Nothing, I'm innocent.

235
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:56,032
It the commissionaires and
everybody and they brought the band.

236
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,803
Who are they going to hang?

237
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:07,363
- There's only one prisoner here.
- Well, if he doesn't fi nish his last meal...

238
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:13,128
HELP! HELP! HELP!

239
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:17,501
You let me out of the jail, you hear,
or I'll go right to the Emporer.

240
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:22,073
Help! What a fine crooked village this
much be. The thieves you must have here.

241
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,850
Let me out! Help! Help!

242
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:31,218
- A common tramp eh?
- Why was I put in this jail? Help!

243
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:34,995
- Open the gate.
- No trial, no justice.

244
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:39,567
I will report this to the Emporer.
This is a crooked village, this is.

245
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:45,928
Don't any of you come near me. If
any of you come near me. I
demand to be released.

246
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,699
If you have been put to any
inconvience, I assure you that my
colleagues and myself are deeply destressed.

247
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,844
This is just a small community. Not
rich or powerful.

248
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:11,600
Be it citizens or travellers, be they
humbled or clothed to the highest
degree of nobility...

249
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:14,780
be they vagrants or inspector
generals appointed by the Emporer...

250
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:19,551
in our village they find courtsey, honor and
strict adherence to the principals of justice.

251
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,099
Command us you Excellency and
we will obey.

252
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:35,455
Believe me your Highness,
I nderstand and value your desire to
remain incognito.

253
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,039
Permit me to compliment you on
your amazing disguise. It's most convincing.

254
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:45,991
In a corrupt city, with dishonest officials,
such a strategy would be most effective.

255
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:51,955
But here in our fair village of
Brodny, we beg you to accept our hospitalilty.

256
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:56,129
Why don't we discuss the entire
situation at dinner.

257
00:29:56,924 --> 00:30:01,099
Go to my house and tell my wife we
have an honored guest. To her to
make a feast, a banquet.

258
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:06,466
Your Excellency, how can we talk in
these sordid sourroundings? At my
home, dinner will be just about ready.

259
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:11,635
A roast, a turkey, several kinds of
game, a rack of lamb and a
magnificent pot-roast.

260
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:15,412
You will probably want a change of
clothes. Quick, some suitable
clothing for His Excellency.

261
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:19,785
- Where will I get the clothing?
- Your uniform, take it off. Now?

262
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:24,358
Your Excellency. Our chief of police
regrets his mistake.

263
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:28,930
He will be delighted for you to wear
his uniform until your luggage arrives.

264
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:34,098
- He's tall, I know he is. Is he going
to stay long? - I hope not.

265
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,279
- What's taking you so long, hurry.
- But I can't get it, it's too tight.

266
00:30:37,677 --> 00:30:43,442
I wonder if the Inspector General will think
it's too tight? Tell me did you notice the
color of his eyes? Are they blue?

267
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:48,412
What are you staring at stupid?
Get busy and set the table.

268
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:54,177
And you two. When you serve, see
that your hands are clean. You
Bela, you remove the dishes when I ring.

269
00:30:54,574 --> 00:30:58,749
Lateues, you bring on the fresh
course and move quickly and see
that you don't spill anything on our guests.

270
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:03,321
- Did you hear me?
- What did I say? I take a bowl of fruits.

271
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:06,502
- When?
- When you ring the bell.

272
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:10,676
Lisa you serve the wine and do
anything else to make yourself
useful. Come Burbus.

273
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:15,447
Put on a clean apron. Did he say
anything about Paris? Budapest? Vienna?

274
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:19,423
That dress was too tight. So tight, it
made her eyes pop out.

275
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:32,345
This is my humble home, Your
Excellency. It isn't large, I've only a
small pittance of a salary.

276
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:42,085
Maria, my jewel. Maria.

277
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:49,838
You're Excellency, this is my wife, Maria.
His Excellency, The Inspector General.

278
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:56,398
- Oh Your Excellency, this is such a pleasure.
- Let me take you hat and sword.

279
00:31:57,989 --> 00:32:01,169
Your Excellency, this is my wife Catherine.

280
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,350
Laslo...

281
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:08,922
We must get rid of him. I'll give him
plenty of brandy, anything to stop
the inspection. You get the glasses.

282
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:13,693
A toast Your Excellency. Something
to prepare the pallate.

283
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,272
- I'll see about the dinner.
- Dinner?

284
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,254
Your Excellency, this way.

285
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,392
A toast to His Excellency. Love live
His Excellency.

286
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:38,145
Laslo, get the wine, the brandy, quickly.

287
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:42,121
Quickly. More brandy Bela.

288
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:47,488
Now Your Excellency, how
charming it is... May I present
Mrs. Burbus Your Excellency.

289
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:51,066
She's the wife of our tax collector
and chemist.

290
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:57,229
Here we are. Your Excellency, a
little more wine. And a toast to His
Majesty, The Emporer.

291
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:00,608
Long live The Emporer.

292
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:11,343
This is Izzy and his twin brother
Gizzy. They're in charge of our
postal department.

293
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,723
- The Inspector General Izzy.
- I'm not Izzy, he is.

294
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,891
- It's very easy to tell by the strawberry mark.
- No, no, no, some other time. One
more aperitif just before dinner.

295
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:25,656
- Dinner is served.
- One last drink Your Excellency.

296
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:29,036
Here's to the righteous.

297
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:33,608
Here's to the evil-doer.

298
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,963
I suppose after Paris and Budapest,
your returning here must be very
distasteful?

299
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,523
What do you think of Switzerland? I
have relatives there. The
Berghoffs. Did you ever run across them?

300
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:24,896
Your uniform is just beautiful One
husband has one just like it.

301
00:34:25,294 --> 00:34:29,270
I hope you're not disappointed in
the simple fair we serve here.

302
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:33,842
Ladies and gentlemen! I would like
to propose a toast.

303
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:39,209
To the fairest city in all the land. To
the home of courage, integrity and honesty.

304
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:42,191
To Brodny.

305
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:54,914
Even if I'd had time to prepare the
proper kind of dinner, I don't suppose...

306
00:34:55,311 --> 00:35:01,275
Your Excellency would have found it
comparable to the table they set at
The Emporer's Palace.

307
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:05,251
I do wish my husband had given me
a little more time.

308
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:10,420
Maria! His Excellency's glass is empty.

309
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,793
Lisa more wine. Quickly, quickly.

310
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:20,359
After you've eaten, perhaps you'll
tell me about your life in Vienna?

311
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:29,106
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.
- That's all right, it was just an accident.

312
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:32,088
Why you clumsy druge.

313
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:39,046
Oh it was nothing, just merely an
accident. I always spill wine all
over my suit.

314
00:35:39,245 --> 00:35:44,016
She didn't mean it. It was just an
accident. Water is very good for wool.

315
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,793
Just that she didn't mean it, it was
just an accident.

316
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:54,750
She really didn't...

317
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:02,304
Latus, bring on the meat course.
Bela the meat courses.

318
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:07,473
- Bring on the meat courses, quickly.
- Pardon me.

319
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,623
Is it true about the women in Paris?

320
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:17,407
- Is there something wrong Your Excellency?
- Oh try this. I always carry it with
me, it'll cure anything.

321
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:45,238
Good-morning Your Excellency.
I thought you would like a glass of
milk before breakfast.

322
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:50,207
- How did I get here?
- We carried you up after dinner,
Your Excellency.

323
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:55,575
We undressed you and you were in
a very playful mood, Your Excellency.

324
00:38:55,972 --> 00:39:00,346
- What a naughty Inspector General.
- What!

325
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:07,502
Maria. All right, all right. Good-
morning Your Excellency.

326
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:14,460
- May I express the hope that you
spent a comfortable night.
- What time is it?

327
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:20,225
It's just past nine. But you've ample
time for a substantial breakfast,

328
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:26,388
Our program is 11 a.m., reception at
the Town Hall, and an inspection of
the Guard of Honor and a town concert.

329
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,767
At 11:30 a parade to the jail and 12:
15 a public hanging.

330
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:32,948
- Hanging?
- Followed by lunch.

331
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:38,911
- This hanging? It isn't anyone I
know, is it?
- It's just some rascle the police arrested.

332
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,887
- He was impersonating a police office.
- Impersonating?

333
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:50,243
- He made off with a sack of apples
from the local fruit merchant.
- Hanging is much too good for him.

334
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:53,821
I realize that His Excellency wants
to continue his journey as soon as possible.

335
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,399
Yes, I must go immediately. No
receptions.

336
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,339
- Would you be kind enough to say
so in your offical report?
- Yes of course, but I must get dressed.

337
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:12,309
Of course. Assemble the villagers
and band to speed His Excellency
on his way.

338
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:15,688
- Where are my clothes?
- Kovach! The uniform.

339
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,260
- Well it's badly stained, I was
having it cleaned.
- Well then a fresh uniform for His Excellency.

340
00:40:20,658 --> 00:40:24,435
- Where will I get one for His Excellency?
- Yours will do.

341
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:29,007
- This is brand new, this wouldn't fit
His Excellency.
- Izzy, Gizzy, take care of this.

342
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:34,573
They are tailors Your Excellency.
They will retify that. A new uniform
for His Excellency in a half an hour.

343
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:43,589
Even in the short time you've been
here, you've captured the hearts of
our people. A pity you have to leave.

344
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:49,951
- I thought I might be coming back
again soon.
- Don't change your plans on our account.

345
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:54,722
Quick, His Excellency's horse.
The Inspector General's horse.

346
00:42:57,902 --> 00:43:02,475
- I'll send the horse back as soon as possible.
- No, no keep it. Help His
Excellency to mount.

347
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:13,209
Oh Your Excellency, great star of
wisdom.

348
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:19,173
Exhaulted one, do not be angry with
your devoted servants. I've hunted
for you everywhere.

349
00:43:19,372 --> 00:43:23,348
Forgive me great master. Forgive
me. Show mercy on your unworthy servant.

350
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:28,715
- Forgive me you numbskull, or I'll
break you in half.
- It's all right Yakov.

351
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:34,480
I am the lowly servant of His Great Lord,
The Inspector General. Due to my
negligence, we were separated on the road.

352
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,462
- I was just leaving.
- I must speak to you first master.

353
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,842
The Emporer has sent you
confidential instructions. A secret message.

354
00:43:42,233 --> 00:43:47,004
- But he was just leaving.
- The Inspector General will decide
that for himself.

355
00:43:51,974 --> 00:43:56,149
What are you doing? Yakov, I'll
never be able to get out.

356
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:05,889
- Yakov why did you stop me? I had a
chance to get away and now they may
hang me. - Be quiet you idiot.

357
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:10,462
Why should they hang The
Inspector General. They lay the
whole town at your feet.

358
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,636
- I've got everything I want.
- You've got everything you want?
What have you got?

359
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:19,010
I didn't let anything slip through my
fingers. What have you got? See!

360
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:22,985
Three spoons? And these fat
thieves are loaded with gold.

361
00:44:23,184 --> 00:44:26,166
But you don't understand. We can
sell the spoons, buy a new wagon
and leave this town.

362
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:32,527
Go on run away. I was right in the
first place. You haven't got an
honest bone in your body.

363
00:44:35,112 --> 00:44:39,088
Wait a minute Yakov. A few days
ago you kicked me out because you
said I wasn't a good thief.

364
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:45,051
I kicked you out? I do everything
for you and this is the thanks I get?

365
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,027
For once in your miserable life you
have a chance to do something really good.

366
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:53,798
What happens? You want to run
like a rabbit.

367
00:44:53,997 --> 00:44:57,774
Never a thought to the people in the
village. Nothing but selfishness.

368
00:44:58,172 --> 00:45:02,346
I crawled through every corner of
this village. Georgi, what misery
exists here.

369
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:07,714
The Mayor has taxed the very life
out of this town. And not content
with that, they steal.

370
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:13,876
35,000 crowns they collected from
the little children and their parents
to buy a pipe organ from the church.

371
00:45:14,274 --> 00:45:18,448
And they trump up a cock and bull
story that the organ was destroyed
and that they sold it in another town.

372
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:23,021
By tonight we can make them pay
35,000 crowns for protection.

373
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:27,195
Then I buy back the organ, you
present it to the town and we
expose these rascals.

374
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:31,370
- May I become a wandering gypsy
if I'm not telling the truth.
- But you are a wandering gypsy.

375
00:45:31,768 --> 00:45:37,135
That proves I'm telling the truth. Now to work
Georgi. The most important thing that you make
them understand is that you know how crooked you are.

376
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:42,900
- They'll shower you with gold.
- 35,000 crowsn Yakov, do you think
they'll give it to me just like that?

377
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:46,876
They will give you more. It never
fails. They will give you more
because you are The Inspector General.

378
00:45:47,273 --> 00:45:50,653
- I don't know how to be an Inspector General.
- That's very simple, you have to
behave like one.

379
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:55,424
- But how?
- Oh how, why what. Don't bother
me with silly technicalities.

380
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:59,598
You're The Inspector General. Be
big, strong, fair.

381
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:10,930
Gentlemen, I have good news for
you. The Inspector General has
decided to remain indefinitely.

382
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:17,490
He demands an inspection of the
financial affairs of Brodny and he
will meet with you at the town hall at 2 o'clock.

383
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:38,363
Big big, be strong, be firm says
Yakov. But if it doesn't work, whose
neck will they jerk?

384
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:42,935
Whose block will they knock off.
Not Yakov.

385
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:48,501
Be an Inspector General.

386
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:56,254
What does an Inspector General
do? lnspect Generals?

387
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:01,025
An Inspector General generally
inspects that is...

388
00:47:01,423 --> 00:47:06,194
they expect them to inspect
generally. If they're expecting a
General Inspector.

389
00:47:15,338 --> 00:47:21,898
However If people aren't suspecting now
accept without detecting an imposter who's
not posted as a pedigree inspector.

390
00:47:22,694 --> 00:47:27,465
Could this pabable imposter say a
gypsy or acoster could possibly get
past them by his posture?

391
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:30,844
In two words-unlikely.

392
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:44,561
So it is not a question to fl ee or not
to flee, but to be or not to be.

393
00:47:45,555 --> 00:47:48,934
And if so, how?

394
00:47:50,922 --> 00:47:56,289
Should I be arrogant? Should I be
elegant? Should I be smart?

395
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,458
A rolling Russian Czar, or very
British impar

396
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:07,223
Or like the KGV in Nice who already
eats the cheese while he says "No
thank-you please".

397
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:10,205
Very smart.

398
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:17,361
I must examine every side of me.
The long, the narrow, the wide of me.

399
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:23,524
The Dr. Jekyll and Hide of me.

400
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:31,277
If I value my anatomy, the skinny
and the pal of me, how shall I start
to play the part?

401
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:40,421
Should I be arrogant?

402
00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:44,596
Up off your knees. Stop licking my boots.

403
00:48:44,994 --> 00:48:46,186
Elegant?

404
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,174
Sugar?

405
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:50,162
A lump more.

406
00:48:51,355 --> 00:48:54,337
- Lemon?

407
00:48:55,728 --> 00:48:58,909
- Cream?
- A dribble.

408
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:04,276
- Tea?
- Never touch it.

409
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:07,656
Or smart?

410
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:12,029
If they don't know what they should
know, they don't know what you know.

411
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:15,409
Arrogant, elegant, smart.

412
00:49:15,806 --> 00:49:16,999
If you say so.

413
00:49:17,397 --> 00:49:19,981
And it's not so! So what?

414
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,354
If you talk to them pa-pa-pa, you
only waste your breathe.

415
00:49:24,752 --> 00:49:28,728
Laught at them they're all you
probably need.

416
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:34,095
Talk and you show your ignorance,
laugh and you show your teeth.

417
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:45,824
Gentlemen, if you would just step aside
for one moment, I should be very happy
to talk to this unfortunate wretch.

418
00:49:51,191 --> 00:49:57,354
The course of action you should act
on that'd actually planned is a
smasher. A lot of thought I put in it.

419
00:49:58,149 --> 00:50:02,721
If you casually cover up your mouth
with your hand,

420
00:50:03,516 --> 00:50:06,498
You will never put your foot in it.

421
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,263
Really gentlemen, please.

422
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:19,420
Sneak a sniff in of snuff.

423
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,787
And so have you no more disease.

424
00:50:24,986 --> 00:50:28,763
Just stand around and wait for them
to sneeze.

425
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:45,660
And you'll see which way will blow
the breeze.

426
00:50:46,654 --> 00:50:52,618
Pay no attention to what he tells.
Do it my way.

427
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:09,700
Stooooop! Please stop!

428
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:13,079
You're confusing me, please stop,
please stop.

429
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:17,453
Please say no more.

430
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:21,429
You're so pleased with yourselves.

431
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:25,206
You don't care about me.

432
00:51:26,597 --> 00:51:29,778
This isn't true.

433
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:40,910
If we didn't care, would we talk this way?

434
00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:44,290
Things are not as bad as they look.

435
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:49,259
No sir, they are much worse.

436
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:54,826
And remember an ear in the eye is
worth two in the bush.

437
00:51:56,814 --> 00:52:01,386
Then how do I play my roll.

438
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:13,115
With you I agree with me, you need
no longer linger.

439
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:16,096
I'll give them the fist.

440
00:52:16,494 --> 00:52:18,283
Give them the wrist.

441
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:23,054
Give them the finger.

442
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,126
To the Town Hall.

443
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:24,879
You'll find everything in order, Your
Excellency.

444
00:53:48,734 --> 00:53:52,312
- Just a moment! What was that?
- What was what?

445
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:55,294
I thought I saw something.

446
00:53:59,866 --> 00:54:02,251
How do you account for this?

447
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:13,185
- There were no taxes that day, Your Excellency.
- If you put your official signature to
the books, Your Excellency.

448
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:19,944
- What is this?
- It's the very best we have Your
Excellency. We're not a very rich community.

449
00:54:47,974 --> 00:54:52,347
I think I'd better not sign this, until I've...

450
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:58,708
- Until you've examined the books
more closely at the house Your Excellency.
- Yes and excellent idea.

451
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:08,449
We shall see, what we shall see.

452
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:17,196
And all I saw was this gypsy show.
The fat gypsy was selling this stuf
and his partner...

453
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,973
had his head on a plate.

454
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:33,497
- Who is that man?
- That His Excellency, The Inspector General.

455
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:39,063
Military Training Quarters.

456
00:59:34,676 --> 00:59:37,857
Dear Yakov.

457
00:59:39,845 --> 00:59:47,796
I can not stay any longer.

458
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:52,965
Love Georgi.

459
01:00:11,453 --> 01:00:17,019
This is the kitchen isn't it? Well
you go right ahead, I'm just inspecting.

460
01:00:30,736 --> 01:00:33,121
Fine, just fine.

461
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:36,302
- Now tell me, is there another way out?
- Out?

462
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:40,476
- Out out.
- Oh you're not leaving Your Excellency.

463
01:00:40,874 --> 01:00:46,043
I can't stay another minute. There's
another town I have to inspect.

464
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,621
- People are waiting. How do I get out.
- I can't believe it.

465
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:53,795
- Can't believe what? You can't
believe I have another town to inspect.
- Of course I do Your Highness.

466
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:59,958
Please don't be angry with me. I
wasn't angry. You were so kind to
me last night. I thought you would stay.

467
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:04,133
And it gave me new hope. Why the
whole village is looking to you for help.

468
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:09,301
- Yes, well I thought perhaps on my way back.
- Oh Your Excellency such
plundering and misery.

469
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:14,669
It's terrible. But you should see this
other town. They need me very badly.

470
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:18,843
- People are waiting and receptions.
- I see.

471
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:23,217
I really mustn't disappoint them.

472
01:01:25,006 --> 01:01:27,590
Well, I'd better be going.

473
01:01:34,548 --> 01:01:38,723
- I'm sorry you won't be more friendly.
- Friendly? Why should I be friendly?

474
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:43,692
I don't care if I hang for what I say I
think. You're as bad as the rest of them.

475
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,271
Worse, because you have the
power to do good and you run away.

476
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:51,644
I'll stay. I can get the organ back. It
didn't burn, I know where it is.

477
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:55,023
- Then you do care about the people.
- Of course I do.

478
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,999
- The whole town will be so happy.
- I want you to be happy Lizzy.

479
01:01:59,794 --> 01:02:03,969
I don't count Your Excellency. I'm
just a kitchenmaid and I'll always be one.

480
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:08,939
But that's no way to look at life.
Things can change over night.

481
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:12,716
After all I wasn't born an Inspector
General.

482
01:02:13,909 --> 01:02:17,487
It just happened. Come on smile.

483
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:38,161
Reach for the moon and look for the
golden rainbow.

484
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:43,330
You will find happy times.

485
01:02:45,517 --> 01:02:52,673
You'll hear a tune, that lives in the
heart of a bluebird.

486
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:57,842
And you'll find happy times.

487
01:02:59,432 --> 01:03:05,396
Thought things look very dark, your
dream is not in vain.

488
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:12,950
For when do you fi nd a rainbow?
Only after rain.

489
01:03:13,944 --> 01:03:21,100
So wish on the moon, and
someday, it may be tomorrow..

490
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:27,462
You will suddenly hear chimes

491
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:39,191
And you'll find your happy, happy times.

492
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,365
Latus, Bela, see to the carriage.

493
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:49,329
Where is everybody? Oh Your Excellency.

494
01:03:50,919 --> 01:03:51,913
Just look what I found in the Brodny
library. It's the new almanac of The
Emporer's official staff.

495
01:03:57,281 --> 01:04:03,046
- Emporer's official staff?
- Both histories of their families and
portraits of their celebrated families.

496
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:08,015
The portraits are very bad, very
bad. You wouldn't recognize the one of me.

497
01:04:08,413 --> 01:04:13,582
- And it's terrible.
- I thought women were only vain
about their portraits.

498
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:19,347
Now I've got to see how bad they've
made you look. You know you've
never even told me your name.

499
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:25,509
Doesn't matter. I'll soon recognize
you and find out all about you and
your beautiful wife and lovely children.

500
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:30,678
I have no wife. None of my familiy
had wives. My father didn't like wives.

501
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:35,648
I mean my mother didn't like my
father's wife. May I have this book?

502
01:04:36,045 --> 01:04:39,425
This looks a lot like you, but older of
course. A relative of yours?

503
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:42,804
- This is my father. Your father?
- Madame Knabe?

504
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:47,774
Married with Peter Knabe, 46 years
old and mother of 12 boys.

505
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:52,545
That was a disguise. My father was
a spy in the war.

506
01:04:52,942 --> 01:04:56,918
He always used to disguise himself
as my mother.

507
01:04:57,515 --> 01:05:02,286
- I was 19 before I could tell them apart.
- Knabe, is that your family name?

508
01:05:02,683 --> 01:05:08,051
- Yes, Farple Knabe.
- Farple, what an unusual name.

509
01:05:08,448 --> 01:05:13,219
Sounds like a morning breeze,
rustling through the leaves of the willows.

510
01:05:13,816 --> 01:05:16,400
What does it mean?

511
01:05:19,978 --> 01:05:22,761
Some kind of soup, I think.

512
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:29,918
- Where were you born?
- Well let me have the book and I'll
tell you all about it.

513
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:35,882
- Some night when we're alone,
perhaps tonight.
- I want to hear everything Farple.

514
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:40,653
You don't know how I yearn to live.
What it means to be married to a
man who doesn't understand.

515
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,032
He's a peasant, a course,
uncultured, a pig.

516
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:48,008
I was forced to marry him. I'm an
attractive woman, am I not?

517
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:52,779
I'm still in the first bloom of my
youth, am I not?

518
01:05:52,978 --> 01:05:57,948
Could a man wish for a more lovely,
intelligent, responsive woman than I am?

519
01:05:58,146 --> 01:06:03,116
- No!
- Oh Farple, you say the most beautiful things.

520
01:06:03,713 --> 01:06:06,297
I really must be going.

521
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,255
- You will help me Farple, won't you?
- Promise! I promise.

522
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:17,827
When we get to Paris, I won't be a
burden for you. I swear.

523
01:06:27,965 --> 01:06:31,742
- Forgive me. May I have a word
with Your Excellency?
- What do you want?

524
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,116
I throw myself on your mercy.
Please Your Excellency, for the
sake of my family.

525
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:39,893
- What is it? What have you done?
- The tax records, it wasn't my idea
to falsify them.

526
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:43,670
It was the Mayor, my own uncle and Toleki.

527
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:49,832
I admit I take bribes, but what kind
of bribes? Puppy dogs, just puppy dogs.

528
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:53,808
- I like puppy dogs.
- You can have them. Oh forgive me.

529
01:06:54,206 --> 01:06:58,380
All 60 of them. And here's a little
gift just to show you how much...

530
01:07:00,169 --> 01:07:03,549
- Who is it?
- It is I, Toleki, superintendant of the school.

531
01:07:03,947 --> 01:07:08,320
- He mustn't find me here.
- Oh he's just a member of the council.

532
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:12,693
Come in.

533
01:07:13,687 --> 01:07:17,067
Your Excellency, may I have a
moment of your time. I have
something that may interest you, look.

534
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:23,031
I have the best interest without a
stain on my heart, or I would never
tell you this.

535
01:07:23,229 --> 01:07:26,609
- Come to the point Tacky.
- Toleki.

536
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:33,567
Sometimes a man must decide between duty
and friends and I feel it is my duty to advise
you of the corruption in the city of Brodny.

537
01:07:33,964 --> 01:07:38,338
This isn't much, but if you will just
accept it as a loan.

538
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:42,512
May I see you a moment Your
Excellency. It's Gizzy the postmaster.

539
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,097
Gizzy! He may not find me here.

540
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:57,024
Come in.

541
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:03,584
I'm a poor man Your Excellency.
Please accept this, this is all I have.

542
01:08:03,982 --> 01:08:07,056
The temptation was too strong. The
others stole more than I did.

543
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:10,859
- Who is that?
- Come with me, you have to hide.
Get in the closet here.

544
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:18,811
- Come in.
- Oh Inspector General. Yes?

545
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:25,172
I must speak to you. My uniform
looks very nice on you.

546
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:30,539
- I'm having one made in black, with
silver across here.
- What is it Kovach?

547
01:08:31,335 --> 01:08:35,509
- I may as well make a clean breast of it.
- Won't you sit down?

548
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:39,883
You see it wasn't for me. It was for
my wife. My wife is not a contented woman.

549
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:45,250
She wants clothing and money and jewels.
I'd give my 6 kids to get rid of my wife.

550
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,220
- There's only 1000 crowns here.
- A 1000 crowns?

551
01:08:51,413 --> 01:08:55,190
- If you just give me a chance to sell the jewels.
- Won't you sit down?

552
01:09:02,545 --> 01:09:04,931
In the bed!

553
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:11,093
Come in.

554
01:09:12,683 --> 01:09:18,051
- Your Excellency.
- I thought I just put you in the closet?

555
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:30,376
Come in.

556
01:09:33,358 --> 01:09:38,328
- I didn't know you were resting Your Excellency.
- I always rest, the doctor said it's
good for my liver.

557
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:42,105
- Maybe I'd better come back?
- No, it's all right. What do you want?

558
01:09:42,502 --> 01:09:45,285
- I just wanted to make a confession.
- I'll take it. Thank-you.

559
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:51,249
I'm as guilty as the rest of the
others. Oh, I mustn't be found here,
where do I hide? On the bed! No!

560
01:09:56,616 --> 01:09:59,002
On top of the bed.

561
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:07,351
Come in.

562
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:12,321
- You don't have to put on any act for me.
- Has the message come yet from
The Emporer?

563
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,297
- Go downstairs and see if my
luggage has arrived.
- What's the matter with you?

564
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:19,279
What's the weather outside like?

565
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:25,441
There's a lot of men hiding in there.
The councilmen came with a lot of bribes.

566
01:10:25,839 --> 01:10:28,224
Bribes? Money?

567
01:10:31,008 --> 01:10:33,592
Where is it?

568
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:39,357
Why? Come in.

569
01:10:41,544 --> 01:10:46,116
Your Excellency, may I speak with
you for a moment? Privately.

570
01:10:57,049 --> 01:11:01,622
- They all brougth him money.
- Gentlemen, I'm going to ask you
to leave the room.

571
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:08,987
Oh Mayor and you too Chief of
Police. His Highness can not
tolerate dishonesty.

572
01:11:09,384 --> 01:11:14,951
- Then why did he accept the bribes?
- His Excellency has many private charities.

573
01:11:15,348 --> 01:11:20,119
I can assure you that not a penny of
that money will ever find its way into
the pockets of The Inspector General.

574
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:23,300
What do you want us to do?

575
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:30,059
It's possible that a few contributions
from you might...

576
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:34,035
- How much?
- Shall we say 100,000 crowns?

577
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,203
- 100,000 crowns!
- I'll be a pauper. Well keep your money.

578
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,782
You can jingle it in your pockets all
the way up the steps of the gallows.

579
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:45,962
- He wouldn't do anything like that.
- He would, and he has.

580
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,528
But he might be inclined to show
lieniency if he can realize the
charitable dream of his life.

581
01:11:51,926 --> 01:11:55,504
A much needed addition of the
Catherdral he built in Vienna.

582
01:11:55,902 --> 01:11:59,679
A new church organ. A fire-proof organ.

583
01:12:00,474 --> 01:12:05,046
- Fire-proof!
- He knows. He knows.

584
01:12:16,377 --> 01:12:19,956
- We can get rid of him without
leaving a trace and none of us will
be involved. - Who will do it?

585
01:12:20,353 --> 01:12:25,323
Vetalo, the woodchopper. You do
as I tell him, he has to.

586
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:29,100
I can get him tonight, during the
reception and confusion and noise.

587
01:12:29,498 --> 01:12:33,275
- But if something goes wrong.
- Nothing will go wrong. Are you sure?

588
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:39,239
After midnight, as soon as everybody has
had plenty to drink, we'll get him into the
barn where Vetalo the woodchopper is waiting.

589
01:12:40,034 --> 01:12:42,419
He will dispose of the body.

590
01:13:08,254 --> 01:13:11,434
- What are you doing?
- What, you think I want to steal it?
I want to count it.

591
01:13:11,832 --> 01:13:16,007
- I already counted it. You can't count.
- Well, it's very heavy so there must
be enough here to buy back the organ.

592
01:13:16,404 --> 01:13:19,784
- Right, you give it to me and I'll go
get the organ.
- Oh no, not without me!

593
01:13:20,181 --> 01:13:23,561
- You can't leave here. They need
you for the reception.
- Well then we'll go after the reception.

594
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:28,133
There's an old Hungarian proverb:
Trust everybody but keep the organ
money in sight.

595
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:34,296
Come in.

596
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,295
- What is that?
- It's just a letter.

597
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,072
- What kind of letter?
- Well a love letter I suppose.

598
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,054
No Yakov, it's private.

599
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:18,626
Yakov you might tear it.

600
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,397
Well?

601
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:29,957
Would you read it for me Yakov?

602
01:14:39,799 --> 01:14:43,576
- Oh Georgi, you are such a lucky guy.
- What is it?

603
01:14:43,973 --> 01:14:48,347
- That a beautiful girl like that would
fall in love with you.
- Read it to me Yakov.

604
01:14:48,744 --> 01:14:54,112
My dearest darling Inspector
General. From the moment I fi rst
saw you, I knew you were the one.

605
01:14:54,509 --> 01:15:01,268
At night I dream of your manly figure,
and your handsome gentle features
drive me mad with passionate love.

606
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:08,425
The sound of your voice thrills me
beyond words, and if I can not have
you for my very own, I will surely die.

607
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:17,569
- Is there any more? Does she say anything else?
- Yes, P.S., please meet me in the
barn at midnight.

608
01:15:18,364 --> 01:15:21,545
Please meet me in the barn at midnight...

609
01:15:24,129 --> 01:15:26,316
Yakov, what does P.S. mean?

610
01:15:29,497 --> 01:15:35,659
- Please Sweetheart.
- Please sweetheart meet me in the
barn at midnight.

611
01:15:55,538 --> 01:15:58,719
- I have the carriage waiting Farple.
- The carriage?

612
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:03,490
My things are all packed. I'll meet
you at the stable after the dance.

613
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:09,309
Cousin Byro...

614
01:16:20,044 --> 01:16:24,616
I have the money. Has he sent in his report?
Then I'll deliver them to him tonight.

615
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:28,393
We can't settle the matter in here.
Where would you suggest?
Outside, in the barn.

616
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:31,971
At midnight? At midnight! He'll be there.

617
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:40,122
I'll go and get ready. I'll see you
later Farple.

618
01:16:52,461 --> 01:16:55,841
I got your note. You're wonderful
At the barn?

619
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:05,581
Thank-you.

620
01:17:16,911 --> 01:17:23,074
Out of my way. I am Colonel Franz
Castine. Comrade, life-long friend
of The Inspector General.

621
01:17:23,471 --> 01:17:27,845
We were friends for many, many
years. Announce me at once young lady.

622
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:31,423
- Yes Colonel.
- Oh... young man.

623
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:37,188
- Problem with the eyes are there Colonel?
- Yes, I was snow-blinded in the Alps with the
Italian campaign with His Majesty, The Emporer.

624
01:17:38,182 --> 01:17:41,363
The Emporer! Long life to The
Emporer.

625
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:46,929
You idiot! You blithering idiot! Now
where are my glasses?

626
01:17:47,326 --> 01:17:50,905
I am so blind without my glasses.

627
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:54,284
Now don't step on them.

628
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:58,260
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- You stupid fool!

629
01:18:00,049 --> 01:18:04,820
- I'll have to go and get another pair.
- No, no now you just stay right there.

630
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:12,772
Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honor to
announce the unexpected arrival of Colonel
Franz Castine of The Emporer's Royal Guard.

631
01:18:13,368 --> 01:18:18,139
Comrade in arms and life-long
friend of Your Excellency, The
Inspector General.

632
01:18:24,898 --> 01:18:29,868
The Colonel is quite near-sighted and has
had the misfortune of breaking his glasses.
Imagine, he broke his glasses.

633
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:34,043
Oh no Colonel, you're kissing the
wrong man. This is The Inspector General.

634
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:38,416
Oh yes of course. How stupid of
me. The Inspector General is really
a much shorter man.

635
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:44,976
Leopold, this is indeed a joy, a joy.
I noticed that you shaved your moustache.

636
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:51,735
- It used to tickle, not me that is.
- It's all right, it's makes you look much younger.

637
01:18:52,332 --> 01:18:57,301
- Your voice seems to sound more youthful
- I've had laryngitis.

638
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:03,066
This is the man, who single-
handed, routed an entire regiment
of the ltalians at the battle of Lavengretto.

639
01:19:03,464 --> 01:19:08,632
And then he pushed their own cannon into
position and fired at the retreating enemy.
Do you remember that my boy?

640
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:11,614
And Austerlitz?

641
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:16,187
He just dove into a raging river and
rescued 4 wounded soldiers.

642
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:20,162
And then on the way, he cut down
10 Spaniards with his sabre.

643
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:27,518
Morale was very low, but with his
magnificent courage he plunged
into the fray and led his men with a song.

644
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:33,084
The victory song of the 94th
regiment. Onward, onward never
looking back.

645
01:19:33,879 --> 01:19:37,855
- How does it go Leopold?
- He doesn't like to be reminded of
that tragic day.

646
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:42,030
- But he might be persuaded to sing
something a little lighter, gay.
- In a little while.

647
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:48,789
- Oh splendid, then I can get my glasses from
the inn. - Why don't you sing something
now and honor the Colonel?

648
01:19:49,186 --> 01:19:52,566
Sing something before he gets his
glasses.

649
01:19:56,144 --> 01:19:59,324
Could I borrow your drink for this
song?

650
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:08,184
AND NOW... and now for my friend
and comrade in arms I

651
01:20:08,582 --> 01:20:13,154
would like to do a gypsy drinking
song.

652
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:20,112
- My wine, he took my wine.
- There's plenty more.

653
01:20:20,509 --> 01:20:23,491
- Why are you trembling for?
- The wine is deadly poison.

654
01:20:23,889 --> 01:20:28,859
Is it? You did it? How very
thoughtful of you. Why I misjudged
you all these years.

655
01:20:29,654 --> 01:20:35,220
No it was for me. For you? Yes, I
couldn't stand it any longer and I
even wrote a confession.

656
01:20:55,298 --> 01:21:00,268
Whisky drew the whispering woods
on a wild Romany pony...

657
01:21:00,665 --> 01:21:03,647
ride the gypsy.

658
01:21:11,201 --> 01:21:15,575
The world thinks him tipsy and
careless and free...

659
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:20,942
But oh the poor gypsy...

660
01:21:25,316 --> 01:21:31,279
his lot is not, what a heart should
be.

661
01:21:31,876 --> 01:21:37,243
night and day and day and night
there's a man with a whip...

662
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:49,430
in his hand, over gypsy he stands
and this is what he says...

663
01:22:00,303 --> 01:22:05,670
Crawl gypsy, sing gypsy, dance
gypsy, laugh gypsy...

664
01:22:06,068 --> 01:22:09,249
cry gypsy, live gypsy, die gypsy.
Drink!

665
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:20,580
Drink to good-byes and drink to
hellos.

666
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:27,736
Drink you alone with thine eyes and
I will drink with my nose.

667
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:31,513
And so he drinks!

668
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:36,086
But first we sing.

669
01:22:40,061 --> 01:22:44,634
How can you sing gypsy song without gypsy
chorus? Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you a
little favor and we have a chorus.

670
01:22:45,031 --> 01:22:50,995
It will sound beautiful, wonderful.
I will give you a little "b". All right?

671
01:22:53,182 --> 01:22:57,953
Very nice, but we get a little
sharper, a little more nose.

672
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:06,898
Very nice, now short huh? I like it.

673
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:10,874
Once more please. Very pretty.

674
01:23:11,272 --> 01:23:16,242
This group here, I will make for you
stock, stock. Please? Everybody
understand, stock, stock.

675
01:23:17,832 --> 01:23:21,808
Very nice.
NO I DIDN'T MAKE IT YET!

676
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,573
Please, I didn't make it yet. Small
stock, stock. Very nice.

677
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:33,735
Loud. I'll be with you in two
minutes.

678
01:23:34,332 --> 01:23:39,301
This little group here, I would like
you to make me a favor with all
your sweet gentle little faces.

679
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:43,078
Make for me ha, ha, ha. This way,
all right, please everybody.

680
01:23:45,265 --> 01:23:49,639
Wonderful. Now everybody please
once again.

681
01:23:50,633 --> 01:23:54,211
Very pretty. I love you to pieces.
Please

682
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:42,915
- Want something to drink, maybe?
- No thank-you Excellency.

683
01:24:55,836 --> 01:24:58,421
And so we drink.

684
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,397
But first we play.

685
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:29,459
Pardon me, I slipped my bow. My
fingers need a reason.

686
01:26:13,475 --> 01:26:15,661
I like it.

687
01:26:16,457 --> 01:26:19,041
Makes me cry.

688
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:36,137
Who me?

689
01:26:49,456 --> 01:26:52,040
And so we drink.

690
01:26:53,631 --> 01:26:56,215
But first we dance.

691
01:27:03,173 --> 01:27:04,763
Pardon me.

692
01:27:44,323 --> 01:27:51,678
And so we drink to eveything we
love.

693
01:27:56,051 --> 01:28:01,419
To everyone we admire.

694
01:28:08,305 --> 01:28:17,648
To the girl who sets your heart a
glow, and sets your heart on fire.

695
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:36,136
And so we drink.

696
01:28:41,702 --> 01:28:43,690
I like it.

697
01:29:08,937 --> 01:29:11,521
Will you excuse me ladies, I have
something...

698
01:29:12,117 --> 01:29:19,473
- I beg your pardon Your Excellency.
- I hope you are enjoying the
evening. Yes, I ah, very much.

699
01:29:56,249 --> 01:29:58,038
Lisa?

700
01:30:05,394 --> 01:30:09,767
Why you clumsy ox. What's the
matter with you, are you crazy?
You could have killed me with that.

701
01:30:12,351 --> 01:30:18,116
Why do you have to work so late at
night, anyway? Whatever you
have to chop can wait til morning can't it?

702
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:22,490
Now go on to bed. I have to meet
someone here. Go on.

703
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:29,646
- Aren't you The Inspector General?
- Yeah. That doesn't mean I can't
meet anybody here, does it?

704
01:30:30,044 --> 01:30:33,225
- No?
- You don't believe it do you?

705
01:30:35,809 --> 01:30:40,381
- Read that!
- "Don't go near the barn."

706
01:30:41,574 --> 01:30:45,351
- "They're going to kill you."
- Yeah, and only two hours ago she...

707
01:30:50,519 --> 01:30:53,501
Would you read that again please.

708
01:30:53,899 --> 01:30:59,266
It says, "Don't go near the barn,
they're going to kill you."

709
01:31:04,204 --> 01:31:08,180
Yakov... My best friend.

710
01:31:24,283 --> 01:31:27,066
- Where's your master?
- My master?

711
01:31:37,204 --> 01:31:40,385
- How did it?
- You know how.

712
01:31:40,782 --> 01:31:46,547
Now gentlemen, let's get down to business.
For a price, I'll get rid of the evidence.

713
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:50,324
The money.

714
01:31:55,692 --> 01:31:59,469
- I don't think I want any supper.
- Oh no.

715
01:33:20,412 --> 01:33:24,387
- What are you doing Yakov?
Where are you going?
- Get away from me.

716
01:33:43,273 --> 01:33:45,459
Georgi, I'm your best friend.

717
01:33:51,622 --> 01:33:54,206
- Where are we going?
- To get the organ.

718
01:33:55,598 --> 01:33:58,977
Make way for The Inspector
General.

719
01:34:01,164 --> 01:34:03,549
Make way for The Inspector
General!

720
01:34:04,742 --> 01:34:07,923
- What did he say?
- It must have been an eccho.

721
01:34:12,296 --> 01:34:16,471
Attention! Announcing the
Emissary of The Emporer.

722
01:34:17,067 --> 01:34:21,441
General Leopold Nikolai Tarantino, His
Excellency, The Inspector General.

723
01:34:43,308 --> 01:34:48,079
He took bribes, he drank all my
wine, he yelled out the window, he
even made love to my wife.

724
01:34:48,476 --> 01:34:54,043
How could I doubt that he was The
Inspector General. I mean, he gave us no
chance to think of deception Your Majesty.

725
01:34:55,235 --> 01:35:00,006
- Isn't that right Gizzy? Izzy, he's Gizzy.
- You can always tell by the
strawberry mark on my leg.

726
01:35:00,205 --> 01:35:02,988
Why it's as big as a...

727
01:35:08,554 --> 01:35:12,928
- I'm Gizzy, he's Izzy.
- Silence! Excuse us Your Excellency.

728
01:35:13,325 --> 01:35:17,898
Well Mayor, I want that tramp.
Send out every man available.

729
01:35:18,494 --> 01:35:22,072
Meanwhile, I will write out an order
for his excecution.

730
01:35:22,669 --> 01:35:26,446
He'll hang today Your Excellency, l
promise you that. Test the gallows.

731
01:35:26,843 --> 01:35:30,024
- I'm Izzy, then he is...
- SILENCE!

732
01:35:38,108 --> 01:35:43,475
Citizens, here is the organ. The
one that was stolen. We gave them
money and...

733
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:47,650
I'll see you in a minute. Here, take
the organ to the church and I'll be
back in a minute.

734
01:35:48,246 --> 01:35:52,024
Come on men, I may need you.
Follow me.

735
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:58,385
Wait here. Ten hut! Oh, never
mind that.

736
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:06,734
I'm glad I found all of you
gentlemen together. This town is
going to be cleaned up from top to bottom.

737
01:36:07,132 --> 01:36:13,493
- This is The Inspector General. - Yes,
Mr. Mayor, I would like you all to know
that the corruption in this city is at an end.

738
01:36:13,891 --> 01:36:17,867
I want a complete and honest report
from you and a complete and
honest report of your tax records.

739
01:36:18,264 --> 01:36:22,240
And a report from you in the
morning. Who is this man? Tell
him to get out, this is official business.

740
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:28,601
Mr. Mayor! In the name of The Emporer,
I call upon you to produce all the tax records
and books of this village immediately.

741
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:33,174
Permit me to interrupt. Let me
show you this communciation which
has just arrived.

742
01:36:46,095 --> 01:36:50,866
- Silly girl. And now to business.
- You filthy bag of bones, this is The
Inspector General.

743
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:56,631
How do you do? We must have a
long talk together sometime. I want
to look at all these books...

744
01:36:57,029 --> 01:37:00,209
Inspector General?

745
01:37:05,974 --> 01:37:09,354
Open up the cell. Hurry man.
Guards.

746
01:37:10,348 --> 01:37:15,715
Take them away. This is what I.
Two hangings at once.

747
01:37:17,703 --> 01:37:23,070
You'll regret this you fat-faced
villiage idiot! Take your hands off
me you misbegotten peasants.

748
01:37:23,468 --> 01:37:28,438
The Emporer will tear this stinking
village down over your ears.

749
01:37:28,835 --> 01:37:34,799
Heads will roll here like marbles,
and yours first. And this flea-ridden
sack of nothing, you call Inspector General.

750
01:37:35,197 --> 01:37:38,377
This isn't The Inspector General,
don't make me laugh.

751
01:37:38,576 --> 01:37:42,353
The Great Emporer wouldn't
appoint such a thing like this, to a
position so important.

752
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:47,919
This is your Inspector General here!
His courage, his manner, his
bearing. Gentlemen take your choice.

753
01:37:48,516 --> 01:37:53,088
- I don't know what to think. -You don't
have to think. If this man is The Inspector
General, then were are his credentials?

754
01:37:53,486 --> 01:37:57,859
- Where are yours? Come on show
them, they have a right to see.
- Come on and show them.

755
01:38:01,437 --> 01:38:05,811
Produce them. Here they are, see?

756
01:38:11,774 --> 01:38:14,359
Your Excellency.

757
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:22,112
I would like to take this opportunity
to tender my resignation.

758
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:27,280
I'm so sorry Your Excellency. It was
our mistake. The imposter will hang!

759
01:38:27,678 --> 01:38:32,449
- This is preposterious!
- If Your Excellency will be so good
to write out the death warrant.

760
01:38:35,232 --> 01:38:38,810
- Arrest that man.
- I'm warning you, I'm warning all of
you. This will be reported to The Emporer.

761
01:38:39,009 --> 01:38:40,997
Lock him up!

762
01:38:46,364 --> 01:38:48,949
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

763
01:38:51,135 --> 01:38:55,509
For one thing, I can't write. I can't
read either.

764
01:38:55,906 --> 01:39:00,081
And even if I could write, I wouldn't
sign his death warrant.

765
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:06,442
- I'm not The Inspector General.
- He's just soft-hearted, here I'll sign it.

766
01:39:07,436 --> 01:39:13,599
You can't it's all over. I couldn't sign
this. That man is completely innocent.

767
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:20,159
I only did it to get the money to buy
the organ back.

768
01:39:20,557 --> 01:39:23,936
Lock them up, put them in chains,
send them to the gallows. Oh Your
Excellency, I'm so sorry.

769
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:27,912
Why this has never happened in
Brodny before. I can assure you
that they will go to the gallows, Your Excellency.

770
01:39:28,309 --> 01:39:32,086
- The gallows will wait its turn, but
not now.
- But Your Excellency...

771
01:39:32,484 --> 01:39:35,068
This man will not hang.

772
01:39:35,665 --> 01:39:39,839
This is the first honest man I've met,
since I left Budapest.

773
01:39:42,026 --> 01:39:45,604
- My chain of office Your Excellency.
- We'll put something else around
your neck.

774
01:39:46,002 --> 01:39:49,381
- Thank-you Your Excellency.
- With band music? What did you
say? With band music?

775
01:39:50,177 --> 01:39:51,966
With band music.

776
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:58,128
I couldn't take this Your Excellency.
I can't even read or write.

777
01:39:58,327 --> 01:40:01,905
- I have no education.
- What you have is much better.

778
01:40:02,303 --> 01:40:05,285
My medal and my sash.

779
01:40:20,393 --> 01:40:26,357
Citizens of Brodny. I have the
honor to present to you, your new Mayor!
