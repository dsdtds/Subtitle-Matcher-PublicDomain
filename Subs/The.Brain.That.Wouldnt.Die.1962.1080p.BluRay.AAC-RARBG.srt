1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,506
(Woman): Let me die.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,759
Let me die.

3
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:21,597
(ominous music)

4
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,957
I should've known
he was as good as dead

5
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,584
when they wheeled him in.

6
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,002
You did everything possible,

7
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,962
everything you could,
Dr. Cortner.

8
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,672
Everything?

9
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,592
Everything except
save my patient.

10
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,679
Everything in the books.

11
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,395
Now, Dad, do I have
permission to take over

12
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,855
and try things my way?

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,152
The operating room is
no place to experiment.

14
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,279
He's dead;
I can't do any harm.

15
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,866
Very well.

16
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,162
The corpse is yours.
Do what you want to do.

17
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:44,872
All right.

18
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,416
Make an opening into
the chest cavity.

19
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,127
Apply 100 milliamps of
current directly to the heart,

20
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,130
then massage by hand.
I'll handle the brain area.

21
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,133
- By yourself?
- By myself!

22
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,638
(ominous music)

23
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,623
I've got to work fast,
if it isn't too late.

24
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,962
You talk as if
he's still alive.

25
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,964
(Woman): He is!

26
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,009
I just picked up a
faint pulse beat.

27
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,969
Keep massaging the heart.

28
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,554
I am, I am.

29
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,015
These electric shocks
should stimulate

30
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,142
the motor area enough to
enervate the heart again.

31
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,686
Then he won't need
any external stimuli.

32
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,647
Keep away from
the motor area.

33
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,608
You'll paralyze him for good.

34
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,194
Which would you rather be:
Paralyzed or dead?

35
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,779
Don't try to play God.

36
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,615
Some choices are
not yours to make.

37
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,784
When the obstetrician
has to decide which to save,

38
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,119
the mother or the child,
who plays God then?

39
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,871
It's part of the game.

40
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,456
The game?

41
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,460
The human body is not a jigsaw
puzzle to experiment on.

42
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,879
Still playing it safe
like the other doctors, hmm?

43
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,549
Might as well save my breath.
Keep massaging the heart.

44
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,510
You've already lost
your patient, doctor.

45
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,261
I'm going to save mine.

46
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,139
(Woman): His pulse is coming
back stronger than ever.

47
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,266
It's unbelievable.

48
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,518
(Man): Nothing is unbelievable

49
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,061
if you have the
nerve to experiment.

50
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,231
I've been working on
something like this for weeks.

51
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,817
In your laboratory?

52
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,652
I knew this would work,

53
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,070
if only I had the opportunity—

54
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,280
You don't conduct
experiments on people.

55
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,866
You should be sure
of the results first.

56
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,787
I am now.

57
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,623
Stop massaging the heart.

58
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,709
Let's see if it can
take over by itself.

59
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,089
(deep breathing)

60
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,517
All right.

61
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,727
Close up the chest.

62
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,273
I'm about finished
with the cerebral area.

63
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,942
How's his pulse?

64
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,360
(Woman): Strong and steady.

65
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,698
(breathing continues)

66
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,008
(sighs) Yeah, you
did perform a miracle.

67
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,761
I may not approve of
your methods but...

68
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,723
I am proud of your results.

69
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,603
(calming music)

70
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,591
That was an amazing...

71
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,552
Even an extraordinary
operation, son.

72
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,138
But it still is too risky.

73
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,765
Too uncontrolled.

74
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,392
Saved his life.

75
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,480
And the aftereffects,
what about them?

76
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,233
You've lost the
urge to experiment.

77
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,693
To explore.

78
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,996
You don't explore on people.

79
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,624
Before you put a scalpel to one,

80
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,168
an operation like this needs
testing under every condition.

81
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,671
Over and over again.

82
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,882
Rabbits, mice, monkeys!

83
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,467
Not people!

84
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,928
That man who should be
dead now won't think so.

85
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,931
There's more to
surgery than just being

86
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,308
a carpenter to patch up walls.

87
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,143
Or a plumber to drain pipes.

88
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,355
Our bodies are capable
of adjusting in ways

89
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,065
we've hardly dreamt of.

90
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,859
If we can only find the key.

91
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm so close now,
so very close.

92
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,825
The key to what?

93
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,660
Complete transplantations.

94
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,205
To be able to transplant
limbs and organs.

95
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458
To be able to replace
diseased and damaged parts

96
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,545
of the body as easily as
we replace eye corneas now.

97
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,506
So that the new parts will
join together as though

98
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,299
they were born there.

99
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,927
It can't be done!

100
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,722
It can be done!

101
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,186
With my new special
compound I've created,

102
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,604
I'll do it,
I know I can do it!

103
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,398
Sure, sure,
that's what you say!

104
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,649
That's what I know!

105
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,026
I know I'm close!

106
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,366
Darling, I'm so proud
of you I could kiss you!

107
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,369
Promises, huh?
Always promises.

108
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,955
Careful, your father
is liable to report us.

109
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,374
(laughs)
And stop the floor show?

110
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:03,959
When you two are
married it won't be fun

111
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,461
to watch anymore.

112
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,087
Well, I can promise
you one thing.

113
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,090
Your grandchildren won't
be test tube babies.

114
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,175
You better hurry
if you wanna catch

115
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,718
that plane to Denver, Dad.

116
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,969
And you know that
medical convention

117
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,554
can't start without you.

118
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,808
Um, Jan, you'd better
check about my reservations.

119
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,644
Oh yes, I'll call the airport.
I'll be right back.

120
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,024
Bill.

121
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,986
The line between scientific
genius and obsessive fanaticism

122
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,196
is a thin one.

123
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,156
Now I want you on
the right side of it.

124
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,783
If I don't experiment,
how can I hope to perform

125
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,577
operations like the one
you almost messed up?

126
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,330
But I can't cover
up for you anymore.

127
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,665
The superintendent
had it out with me.

128
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,917
He thinks it's you
who's been stealing

129
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,503
those limbs from the
amputee operations.

130
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,213
So what if it is?

131
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,132
I've got to have limbs for
my transplant experiments.

132
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,843
Well, you said test and experiment,
test and experiment!

133
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,472
Yes, but limbs and
organs taken from people!

134
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,557
I've got to have
them to work with.

135
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,478
Sure, I've made a few mistakes.

136
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,147
But I've learned from them,
I've learned!

137
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,611
Your reservations
are all set,

138
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,279
3:30 take off.

139
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,575
Well, what have you two
planned for the weekend?

140
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,410
Oh, nothing much.

141
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,621
Just a quiet weekend.

142
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,497
Are you sure
you're not going up

143
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,832
to the country house?

144
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,960
You're always
sneaking off up there.

145
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,920
That place gives me the creeps,

146
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,755
I should've sold it
when your mother died.

147
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,382
You can't sell that place!

148
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,509
Well, I mean it's nice to
get away from the city,

149
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,344
I can work without
anyone snooping around.

150
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,012
You spent too
much time up there.

151
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,642
All right, I'll see
you both in a few days.

152
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,644
I've got to clean up
and get out of here.

153
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,566
Fine operation or not, Bill,

154
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,442
you're walking on thin ice.

155
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,528
But don't go too far!

156
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,370
Oh, every time
you touch me

157
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,830
I go out of my mind.

158
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,874
I wanna kiss you.

159
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,334
Bill, I wanna get married,

160
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,378
I can't stand not having you!

161
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,463
You've been wonderful!

162
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,090
Oh, I'd rather be a bride.

163
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,509
In a few more weeks.

164
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,387
Then nothing will keep us apart.

165
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,639
We'll be together.

166
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,653
Dr. Cortner!

167
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,118
I'm so glad you're here.

168
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,536
I was afraid you'd gotten away.

169
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,413
There is a very
important phone message

170
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,457
that came to you;
it sounded quite urgent.

171
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,541
I have been looking
everywhere.

172
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,835
it was from
a man called Kurt.

173
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,129
He called from
the country place,

174
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,381
and he said something
terrible had happened,

175
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,133
and he wanted you
to come right out.

176
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,219
Thank you.

177
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,806
Well, you've always
wanted to know

178
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,934
what's kept me away from
you so many weekends.

179
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,269
Have you got the
keys to your car?

180
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,617
Why haven't you ever
taken me up here before?

181
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,368
Because the things
I'm working on

182
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,827
don't need
an audience.

183
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:29,206
That telephone call,
what about it?

184
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,625
All right, all right,
hold off the questions.

185
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,379
Why the mystery, Bill?
What's this all about?

186
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,632
We'll be there soon
enough, you'll see.

187
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,509
I've got to hurry.

188
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:45,138
(anticipatory music)

189
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,370
(screaming)

190
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,873
(crash)

191
00:13:53,082 --> 00:14:01,082
(urgent music)

192
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,372
(Bill): Kurt? Kurt!

193
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,958
(knocking)

194
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,417
All right, all right!

195
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,460
For God's sake open the door!

196
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,628
I'm coming!

197
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,755
(knocking)

198
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,633
What's the matter?

199
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,677
What's happened to you?

200
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,011
There's been a
terrible accident.

201
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,055
I've got to save her,
I've got to save her.

202
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,682
What is it,
what have you got there?

203
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,975
Kurt, please!

204
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,601
Sterilize the tubes and
instruments, quickly!

205
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,978
Well what are
you going to do?

206
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,187
Aren't you going to have a
look in the closet first?

207
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,064
Oh, I can't now,
this is more important.

208
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,315
But you don't understand!

209
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,483
For God's sake,
Kurt, this is urgent,

210
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,609
do as I tell you
before it's too late,

211
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,611
I can't waste precious
time arguing with you!

212
00:17:52,655 --> 00:18:00,655
(anticipatory music)

213
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,910
The eyelids!

214
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,870
I saw them move!

215
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,374
It can't be!

216
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,962
My eyes are deceiving me.

217
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,631
What you see is real.

218
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,135
What's done is done and
what I've done is right.

219
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,054
It's the work of science.

220
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,772
(whimpering)

221
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,400
I remember...

222
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,402
Fire.

223
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,574
Burning.

224
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,247
Let me die.

225
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,544
Let me die.

226
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,631
I've had success
with transplants,

227
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,383
now I can do it for her.

228
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,890
Transplant her onto what?

229
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,726
I brought her back,
she'll live,

230
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,561
and I'll get her another body.

231
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,022
I can make her complete again.

232
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,525
Only a madman can believe

233
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,527
that she could ever
be like before!

234
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:20,904
Don't argue with me.

235
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,491
I love her too much to
let her stay like this.

236
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,910
I'll restore her as before.

237
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,369
You'll see.

238
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,914
Can't you realize?

239
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,415
Can't you see?

240
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,876
There's a pattern
to all that lives!

241
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,795
An order,
an arrangement.

242
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,506
She had a heart,
and a brain,

243
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,965
and her spirit was in both,

244
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,342
not in one
or the other!

245
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,593
No.

246
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,596
I'll give her a
brain and a heart.

247
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,765
Yes, and what of her soul?

248
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,602
You say you love her and...

249
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,146
you can remember
her love for you.

250
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,359
Then how can you make of
her an experiment of horror?

251
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,613
All the skill and science
I possess was meant for this.

252
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,241
Life has a pattern.

253
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,743
The whole pattern of my
life is shaping itself

254
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,328
to save her now.

255
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,580
Then you intend to
go through with it?

256
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,623
Yes.

257
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,128
Sleep, my darling.

258
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,257
Rest and grow stronger.

259
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,143
(whimpering)

260
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,730
How long do you think
we can keep her alive

261
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,315
under these conditions?

262
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,570
48, 50 hours
at the most.

263
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,779
Yes.

264
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,824
And you really
believe you can work

265
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,534
a transplant on her?

266
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:51,953
Successfully?

267
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,079
Yes.

268
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,457
Like my arm?

269
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,625
(ominous music)

270
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,627
Withered and deformed.

271
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,922
Yours was an early
experiment that failed.

272
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,426
With her I'm using
my new Adreno-Serum.

273
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,469
It must work.

274
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,682
I...
I've got to go now.

275
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,478
If the police,
or anyone, call,

276
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,607
tell them you don't
know anything about it.

277
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,109
I don't think anyone
will trace us here

278
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,737
because her body was
burned in the wreckage.

279
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,614
Yes, yes,
of course, of course.

280
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,365
Look, Bill,
before you go,

281
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,492
do have a look in that closet.

282
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,536
It's the reason why
I called you up here.

283
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:52,055
(gurgling)

284
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,630
Keep it locked!

285
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,591
Last night it go so violent,
it almost broke out!

286
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,635
Oh, no, not through that thickness.

287
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,136
Keep it closed.

288
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,520
I've got to think about her now.

289
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,358
I've got to find her a body.

290
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,318
How are you going to
go about getting one?

291
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,533
Bill, how will you do it?

292
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,411
There are ways.

293
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,207
There are ways.

294
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,795
(ominous music)

295
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,304
(groaning)

296
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:39,321
(swanky jazz music)

297
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,613
(applause)

298
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:42,160
(seductive jazz music)

299
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:53,648
(machines whirring)

300
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,697
What took you so long?

301
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,865
What made you
think I'd come?

302
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,326
You know a good
thing when you see it.

303
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,078
Yeah, there was plenty to see.

304
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,205
I liked your act.

305
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,915
Is that all you liked?

306
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,084
Well your costume,
what there was of it,

307
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,335
was interesting.

308
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,545
Is that all?

309
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,589
The rest of the
equipment is standard.

310
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,803
But, uh, the arrangement
is pretty special.

311
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,516
You're no tourist just
looking at the sights.

312
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,060
What are you doing
here, slumming?

313
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,812
Oh, I get my
allowance once a week.

314
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,274
Okay, if you're so loaded,
you pay for the drinks.

315
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,817
I already did.

316
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,069
Are you hustling for the house?

317
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,571
I hustle for myself.

318
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,702
I'm the leading
lady around here,

319
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,079
I can sit with
the squares out front

320
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,042
or I can relax back
here with my friends.

321
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,794
I'll bet you you don't
have an enemy in the world.

322
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,671
Hmm?

323
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:46,552
(ominous music)
(machines whirring)

324
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,854
Let me die.

325
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:04,653
(whimpering)

326
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,238
Let me die.

327
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,662
Where are you from?

328
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,830
Oh, around.

329
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,374
Just looking around.

330
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:20,544
When you get done
looking, then what?

331
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,296
I operate.

332
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,341
I get your message;
you're coming across.

333
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:30,638
You could flip any chick
in the house; why me?

334
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,265
Well, like I said,
I'm looking.

335
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,601
Well, you don't have
to look any further.

336
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,645
I'm not gonna fake it for you.

337
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,689
When do you go
on again, huh, when?

338
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,859
Relax, I got another show yet.

339
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,820
But it could be for you.

340
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,696
Oh, I was just asking.

341
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,825
Try taking.

342
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,161
Are you getting nervous?

343
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:55,955
I'm over 21.

344
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,666
Oh it isn't that, it's...

345
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,209
I've just got things to do.

346
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,420
Things to take care of.

347
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,672
Well, if that's anything
that makes you sick

348
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,714
what could be more important

349
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,384
that could be taken
care of right now?

350
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,554
Oh I've, uh,

351
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,265
I've got to see about
helping somebody.

352
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,476
Somebody who needs
my help very badly.

353
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,645
You can't cut out
on me now, baby.

354
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,481
Not when you've got
me feeling so good.

355
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,650
I'm so warm all over.

356
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,653
I'm good for you.

357
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,865
I know I'm good
for what you want.

358
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,659
You may be just
what I'm looking for.

359
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,377
You've got your nerve.

360
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,212
Oh, look who's talking.

361
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,715
Why don't you haul
your beat-up body

362
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,176
back to the bar with
the rest of the flies?

363
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,635
Keep your g-string on.

364
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,138
I only came in here
to change my clothes.

365
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,556
I got admission.

366
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,100
Now I'd like to see
the rest of the show.

367
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,520
Come back in half an
hour and maybe you will.

368
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,897
Get lost.

369
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,524
Hi, loverboy.

370
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,610
I see you've met the queen.

371
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,528
(laughing)

372
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:10,696
Hey.

373
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,532
Come here, don't hide.

374
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,950
You know you've got
the kind of face

375
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,827
a girl doesn't mind looking at.

376
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:18,704
Even out front all
the other girls

377
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,164
were asking about you.

378
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,457
Get out of here.

379
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,876
Two's company,
three's a crowd.

380
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,421
Who's to tell me to
blow if I don't want to?

381
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,591
This here is my dressing
room too, remember?

382
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,302
It kills her to see
me make time.

383
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,929
You're the only thing
that's going to be made

384
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,515
around here tonight, honey.

385
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,933
Eat your heart out.

386
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,768
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

387
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,686
Yeah, well, uh,
I'd better be going, hmm?

388
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,563
What for?

389
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,397
Look what you've done!

390
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,525
You come busting in here
with your two cents.

391
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,652
Let me see you later.

392
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,612
I'll make everything up to you,

393
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,072
I swear I will.

394
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,200
Yeah, come on back later.

395
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,618
I'll remember you.

396
00:33:58,495 --> 00:33:59,912
Yeah, that's
what I'm afraid of.

397
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:04,375
(upbeat jazz music)

398
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,379
You lousy tramp.

399
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,880
Once in a blue moon
I latch onto a guy

400
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,259
with class and you mess it up.

401
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,510
Eh.

402
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,303
What makes you
think you had him?

403
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,514
He wouldn't have you on a bet.

404
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,682
Says who?

405
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,600
Says me.

406
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,186
What's a guy like that
want with leftovers for?

407
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,604
Leftovers?!

408
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,400
Why, you cheap
third-rate stripper!

409
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,821
(incoherent screaming)

410
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,114
Let go!

411
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,412
There.

412
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,121
No!

413
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,622
I'll mash you like a bug.

414
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,125
Don't you cry.
Watch out.

415
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,626
(cat meowing)

416
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:52,673
(foreboding music)
(machines whirring)

417
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,038
You.

418
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,666
Inside the closet.

419
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,545
What has he done to you?

420
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,638
I know there's someone there.

421
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,770
Knock once if you hear me.

422
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,229
(knocks)

423
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,297
Then I'm not the first.

424
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,842
Knock twice if
I'm not the first.

425
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,387
(knocks twice)

426
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,229
He should've let me die.

427
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,734
I hate him for what
he's done to me.

428
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,739
If he only knew what it's
like being like this.

429
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,037
Do you know what it's like?

430
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,873
(knocks)

431
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,714
Together we could have revenge.

432
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,009
You want revenge?

433
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,012
(knocks)

434
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,114
Yes.

435
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,243
You the thing inside,
and me the thing out here.

436
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,456
My brain is still untouched.

437
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,500
And his keeping me alive
has given me a power

438
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,127
he didn't count on.

439
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:39,548
A power that you can feel.

440
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,343
Across this room and
through that door.

441
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,096
Can't you?

442
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,975
(three knocks)

443
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,829
Together we're both
more than things.

444
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,958
We're a power as hideous
as our deformities.

445
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,629
Together we'll
wreak our revenge.

446
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,467
I shall create power

447
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,719
and you will enforce it.

448
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,681
You, the thing inside.

449
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:39,559
Me, the thing out here.

450
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,398
(pounding at door)

451
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:05,861
(laughs)

452
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,336
What's locked behind that door?

453
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,088
Horror.

454
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,133
No normal mind can imagine.

455
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,928
Something even more
terrible than you.

456
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,555
No, my deformed friend.

457
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,602
Like all quantities,
horror has its ultimate.

458
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,187
And I'm that.

459
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,438
No.

460
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,107
There is a horror beyond yours,

461
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,651
and it's in there.

462
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,403
Locked behind that door.

463
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,033
The paths of experimentation
twist and turn

464
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,868
through mountains
of miscalculation

465
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:58,747
and often lose themselves
in error and darkness.

466
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,501
Behind that door
is the sum total

467
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,586
of Dr. Cortner's mistakes.

468
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,718
He had no right to
bring me back to this.

469
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,307
Perhaps not.
Who knows?

470
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,559
But you should know...

471
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:24,064
that before he injected
the serum into that,

472
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,067
it was but a mass
of grafted tissues.

473
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,235
Lifeless.

474
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,654
It just lay there,
weighted down

475
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,241
with its transplants of broken
limbs and amputated arms.

476
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,660
But with this serum,

477
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,246
it began to breathe.

478
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,415
That's impossible.

479
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,668
Would you have
thought possible

480
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,836
what he has already done?

481
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,505
Take yourself.

482
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,841
He has brought you back.

483
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,134
You live!

484
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,179
And only a few years ago,

485
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,307
all transplants were impossible.

486
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,810
That's what he's
been doing up here

487
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,895
where no one could see his work?

488
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,147
Yes.

489
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,650
Experimenting with
transplants on that...

490
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:10,944
and on me.

491
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,115
Letting him
tear away my flesh

492
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,660
time after time,
test after test.

493
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,330
My hopes shattering
with each grafted arm

494
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,999
he fastened to me.

495
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,336
Watching it wither and warp.

496
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,758
Instead of strengthening.

497
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,595
Now you see,

498
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,848
he's learned from his mistakes.

499
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,686
And you stayed with him.

500
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,647
Helping him in his grotesque work

501
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,691
that he claims is for science.

502
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,986
Was there a place
for me on the outside

503
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:54,404
with this?

504
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,158
In a world where eyes
would look upon me

505
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,578
with pity and people
would turn away from me

506
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,121
in disgust.

507
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,752
No, the alcoholic
has his bottle.

508
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,130
The dope addict his needle.

509
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,760
I had my research.

510
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,681
I used to be a surgeon.
It was my life.

511
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,601
Then one night in
the laboratory,

512
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,896
there...
there was an accident.

513
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,024
They had to amputate my arm.

514
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,614
And...

515
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,408
He has used you, too...

516
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,078
I had no choice.

517
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,080
He was my only hope.

518
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,999
A surgeon needs both
his arms, not just one.

519
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,710
Well, you see,

520
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,630
my transplanted
grotesqueness stayed,

521
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,132
and so did I.

522
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,260
I live only for the day
he can work a successful

523
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,137
transplant to my body.

524
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,597
That is why I stay.

525
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,183
Transplant...

526
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:08,520
my head onto another body?

527
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,856
Yes.

528
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,650
And he's insane with
the belief he can do it.

529
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,612
But the tissues of
my body would reject

530
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,656
the tissues of another.

531
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:22,409
Reject it as the
foreign substance it is.

532
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,035
The transplant would
never take,

533
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,079
it would never
stay in place.

534
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,790
My blood's antibodies
would attack it

535
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,959
as they attack any
invading matter.

536
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,962
Yes, but his new discovery,

537
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,840
this new serum,
may change all of that.

538
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,011
This serum,
injected into the bloodstream,

539
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,305
affects the lymphoid tissues.

540
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,558
Here in the neck,
the lymphoids

541
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,518
that provide the
antibodies for the blood

542
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,896
that detect foreign
transplanted matter.

543
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,940
It was untested, untried.

544
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,401
Until we used it on you.

545
00:44:56,986 --> 00:45:00,030
So that liquid in the blood

546
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,782
that's being pumped
through what's left of me...

547
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,078
is what makes me feel the...

548
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,833
(laughs)

549
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,629
He may produce results
he didn't ask for.

550
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,464
Results?

551
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,760
You mean,
like this?

552
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,639
Results more
terrible than your arm

553
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,390
of relative beauty.

554
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,893
Results of power.

555
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,562
Of magnitude.

556
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,272
Power?

557
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,399
What power?

558
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,945
Can't you see that you're
at the mercy of every

559
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,947
element of the universe?

560
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,157
How can you speak of power?

561
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,493
I have a power.

562
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,537
This liquid that's
he's pumped into me,

563
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,790
my brain burns with it.

564
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,919
That thing inside
and I are in touch.

565
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,088
Want me to prove it?

566
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,423
Oh, you can prove nothing.

567
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,301
You're powerless!

568
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,388
I'll show you
how powerless I am.

569
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,892
You.

570
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,478
Behind that door.

571
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:18,525
(doorknob rattling)

572
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,072
Let me know if you hear me.

573
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:27,117
(knocks twice)

574
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:31,830
Whoever,
whatever you are...

575
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,874
I command you.

576
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,168
(knocks)

577
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,170
You understand me?

578
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,677
I'm only a head and
you're whatever you are.

579
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,597
Together we're strong!

580
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,559
More powerful than any of them.

581
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:58,064
(anticipatory music)
(door creaking)

582
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,490
What are you running from?
What's wrong with you?

583
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,993
Oh, it's you.

584
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,038
There's something wrong,
something beyond control

585
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,581
in that room.

586
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,666
There's nothing
beyond my control.

587
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:17,542
She's alive and
I'll keep her alive

588
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,210
until I find her a body.

589
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,464
I can't talk anymore,
I'm tired,

590
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,673
I've got to go to sleep.

591
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,134
Then you...
you didn't find her a body?

592
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:27,552
Well, I've got to be careful.

593
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,262
I can't afford to be
identified as the last person

594
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,348
seen with a girl
before she disappears.

595
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,391
Do you think you'll get one?

596
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,648
There are many things
left for tomorrow.

597
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:50,408
(swanky jazz music)

598
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,516
Hi, I was about to call a cop

599
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,143
the way you were
looking me over.

600
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,269
How have you been, Bill?

601
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,687
Oh, just fine, Donna.

602
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,439
I haven't seen you
for quite a while.

603
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,107
Too long, I'm still
waiting for that call you

604
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,650
once promised me.

605
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,569
Ah, you know how
it is with interns.

606
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,778
All work.

607
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,321
All work and
no play even makes

608
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,865
for dull doctors.

609
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,160
You're gonna lose that
bedside manner of yours.

610
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,621
Say, how about a little
side course in anatomy?

611
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,498
Yours, anytime!

612
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:21,499
No, not mine.

613
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,376
A Body Beautiful
contest, you know,

614
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,379
bathing suit models, plenty
of females on the hook.

615
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,215
Your eyes will have a
field day, interested?

616
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:30,508
Oh, why not?

617
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,552
You're just what
the doctor ordered.

618
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,137
Come on, jump in.

619
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,017
Ah, on second thought...

620
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,560
I just remembered I've
got to stop by my place

621
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:41,769
and take care
of a few things.

622
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,730
It'll only take a minute.
You don't mind, do you?

623
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,065
I always follow
the doctor's orders.

624
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,610
Anything you
prescribe, I'll take.

625
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,737
That's what I like
about you, Donna.

626
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,238
Always so obliging.

627
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,870
Hey Donna, where are you
going, what's the hurry?

628
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,121
Hey Jeannie,
we're going to look

629
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,456
for some bodies.

630
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,248
You mean the contest?

631
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:02,999
Yeah.

632
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:03,750
Got any room for me?

633
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,667
Oh sure, plenty.

634
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:05,960
Bill, this is Jeannie Reynolds.

635
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,378
Jeannie, this is
Dr. Bill Cortner.

636
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,671
- Hi.
- Hello.

637
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,507
Hop in, but first we
gotta stop off at his place.

638
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,549
Sure.

639
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,311
Well as a matter of
a fact, that can wait.

640
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,189
Now that there's two of
you, it will have to wait.

641
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,525
Guess he thinks
there's safety in numbers.

642
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,984
Oh, this time there is.

643
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,986
We promise not to hurt you.

644
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,655
And I promise
not to hurt you.

645
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,574
(laughing)

646
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,576
(car engine revving)

647
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,000
(chattering)

648
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:46,918
Oh Bill, there's a seat.

649
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,253
Oh, there looks fine.

650
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,968
(applause)

651
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,261
Oh, thank you.

652
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,221
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

653
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,931
Well, it looks like
we're about ready to go.

654
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,516
Backstage are five of the
girls who have reached

655
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,477
the contest finals, and
we are here to choose

656
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,479
Miss Body Beautiful.

657
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,773
Now we've eliminated
everyone except the five

658
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,985
finalists and they will be
judged solely by your applause.

659
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,319
So let's bring them on.

660
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:14,320
First...

661
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,781
Helen Appleton.

662
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,117
(applause)

663
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:24,122
(swanky jazz music)

664
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,596
Betty Brockton!

665
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:44,601
(applause)

666
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,486
Terri Lund!

667
00:51:55,696 --> 00:52:00,074
(applause)

668
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,666
Peggy Howard!

669
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:13,254
(applause)

670
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,517
She has the second
nicest body I've ever seen.

671
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:27,769
What, second to you?

672
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,271
No, another girl,
a figure model.

673
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,774
You remember that one
in school, years ago.

674
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,400
The one who had the accident.

675
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,612
Oh yeah, yeah,
Doris, uh...

676
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,529
Doris Powell.

677
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,572
Yeah, is she still around?

678
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,741
Few people see her nowadays.

679
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,535
She just stays in her studio
posing for art classes

680
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,204
and camera bugs.

681
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:50,166
(foreboding music)

682
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,417
(thinking)
A figure model.

683
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,961
Poses for art classes.

684
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,423
The nicest body she's ever seen.

685
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,842
The nicest body.

686
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:01,928
Maybe this is the one.

687
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,471
She's got to be!

688
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,891
I can keep Jan alive only
for a few more hours.

689
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,519
I've got to find her a body.

690
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:26,661
He... he intends
to kill somebody.

691
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,415
To rob them of their body.

692
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,127
Do you hear me?

693
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:36,546
(knocks)

694
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,675
Yes, you hear me.

695
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,512
You know how Bill's
egotism drives him

696
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,055
on and on.

697
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,308
To infamy upon infamy.

698
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,523
How can good ever
be born of evil?

699
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,484
(knocks twice)

700
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,615
Yet he claims his
work is for science.

701
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,701
For humanity.

702
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,502
To be joined to
flesh not your own.

703
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,090
What's human in this?

704
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,886
Of how you must exist?

705
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,679
Locked behind that door.

706
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,725
We've got to stop him!

707
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,686
(loud knock)

708
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:42,855
(swanky jazz music)

709
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,125
Okay, boys,
I've had it for today.

710
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,001
Come on baby, one more.

711
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,918
Just one more, please!

712
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:21,961
Another five minutes, baby!

713
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,671
Time's just about up anyway.

714
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:24,881
Okay.

715
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,482
Say, Doris?

716
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:44,901
Would you like to
have a drink with me?

717
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,194
Just you and me,
away from everybody,

718
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,446
some place where
nobody will butt in,

719
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,615
where you and I can
really be alone.

720
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,325
No, thank you.

721
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,869
How about posing
for me, private-like?

722
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,455
I'll pay you real money,
real good money.

723
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,623
The kind of money they
don't throw at you

724
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,292
everyday and for doing
hardly nothing at all.

725
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,628
I do my posing
for classes only,

726
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,714
Wednesdays and
Saturdays 8:00 to 10:00.

727
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:07,590
Yeah, I know,
but we can—

728
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,133
Goodnight.

729
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,155
See it all, mister?

730
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,990
The show's over.

731
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,077
Next time bring a
camera and buy a ticket.

732
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,412
I'm not running a charity!

733
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,748
You don't remember me,
do you, Doris?

734
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:46,587
Every guy on the make
gives me that same tired line.

735
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:47,964
I'm Bill Cortner.

736
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,260
Bill Cortner.

737
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,722
Long time ago, that fight.

738
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,433
You almost tore
that wise guy apart

739
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,935
for making fun of me.

740
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,729
After my accident.

741
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,482
Look, uh, can't we
go somewhere and talk?

742
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,150
No, I don't date men.

743
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,778
Because I pose like I do,

744
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,447
your mind works overtime.

745
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,616
You get ideas.

746
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,994
You're all alike.

747
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,287
No, not all of us.

748
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,956
I'm not on the make for you.

749
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,501
Okay, so maybe
you're better than most.

750
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,420
Maybe not.

751
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,839
I still hate all men.

752
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,551
I hate them for what
one did to me once.

753
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,469
Have you forgotten?

754
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,139
Well, have you?

755
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,017
No, I haven't forgotten.

756
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:44,103
Well, neither have I.

757
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:47,732
I carry the memory
around with me.

758
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,402
Yeah, but you can't hide
yourself away here forever.

759
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,779
Posting bare in front
of a bunch of neurotics.

760
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,323
Listen, Galahad.

761
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,660
I trusted a man once,
all the way!

762
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,162
What did it get me?

763
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,956
He gets his head full of
jealous lies and I get—

764
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:04,665
You've got to
forget what happened!

765
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:05,875
How can I forget?!

766
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,627
I carry the memory
around with me.

767
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,963
Permanently!
(ominous music)

768
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,970
Am I so appealing to you now?

769
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,890
Still so interested?

770
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,687
Doesn't it make you sick?

771
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,027
You don't even
turn away from me,

772
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,654
like everyone else does.

773
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,408
To me you're not ugly.

774
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,368
I see only beauty in you.

775
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,788
You have a lovely
body and a face

776
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,831
that can be made
beautiful again also.

777
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,541
Yeah.

778
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,796
I've heard that song before.

779
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,506
I'm a doctor, I know.

780
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,466
My father is one of the
leading plastic surgeons,

781
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,551
if anyone can help you,
we can, I know I can.

782
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,472
I've been to doctors;
it's no use.

783
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,474
The scar tissue's too deep.

784
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,517
No one can help me!

785
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,019
Ah, ah, that was
a few years ago.

786
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,355
Today nothing is hopeless.

787
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,650
Yeah, we can graft scar
and skin tissue that...

788
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:16,112
Why we can even freeze
areas of the skin,

789
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,489
and sand away
damaged skin tissues.

790
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,701
The way you say that,
that look in your eyes.

791
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:25,996
I almost wanna believe you.

792
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,499
I almost wanna believe you!

793
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,627
Well then start
believing, hmm?

794
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,563
Even if your
father could help me,

795
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,731
I couldn't pay him the kind
of money it would take.

796
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,358
Oh, don't talk about money,

797
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,485
he does a lot of work
without any charge.

798
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,658
Why should you
wanna do this for me?

799
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,578
What's in it for you?

800
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,498
I'm gonna make your
face beautiful again,

801
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,750
cut it off and give
your body away.

802
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:17,173
(laughs)

803
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,300
I'm sorry.

804
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,010
Bill...

805
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,764
I have been knocked
around so many times...

806
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,184
I've lost count!

807
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,270
It's tough living with this.

808
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,064
I don't mean to
sound ungrateful.

809
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,649
Well, because you've
been battered around,

810
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,067
don't go sour.

811
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,986
You shouldn't lose
your trust in people.

812
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,279
Not all of us.

813
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,533
I believe you, I want to.

814
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,579
Do you really think
something can be done?

815
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,039
Only my father knows.

816
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,541
Look we have a country
place just out of town.

817
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,210
He's visiting for the weekend.

818
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,295
I could take you there
now for a consultation.

819
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,796
You mean tonight?

820
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,381
Well, if you'd rather
wait till he comes back,

821
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:00,549
if he comes back.

822
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:01,926
Oh no, no, I mean,
he wouldn't be annoyed,

823
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,345
being bothered with
me so late at night?

824
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,513
Well, you let me
do the worrying, huh?

825
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,515
I'll do anything
that'll help me

826
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,559
get rid of this face.

827
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,895
Well, that's where I come in.

828
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,272
Remember the last
time I helped you?

829
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,444
Where are you going?

830
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,529
Who are you calling?

831
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,324
My girlfriend, I want
to tell her the news.

832
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,326
Before you know what
the verdict is gonna be?

833
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,788
(ominous music)

834
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,748
You're right, I
shouldn't talk until I know

835
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,333
what's going to happen.

836
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,710
My girlfriend, she's
supposed to drop in later,

837
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,587
I'll have to leave her
a note or something.

838
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,089
Well, just tell her
you'll see her later.

839
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,548
Otherwise she'll ask a
lot of nosy questions.

840
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,300
We wanna be sure first.

841
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,718
Just throw something on, huh?

842
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,428
I'll be with you in a minute.

843
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,482
Just tell her
you'll keep in touch.

844
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,777
I'll leave it on the
table, she'll see it.

845
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,533
Had to go out with
old friend Bill Cortner.

846
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,829
I'll call you tomorrow, Doris.

847
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,665
Here.

848
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,214
I'll leave it on the lamp.

849
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,053
She'll see it, won't she?

850
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,139
That's the first
place she'll look.

851
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,057
I'll leave the
lights on for her.

852
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,896
Hmm.

853
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,734
I have waited
so long for this.

854
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,652
So have I.

855
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:48,032
(door creaking)

856
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,997
(banging)

857
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,541
Again!

858
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:58,876
Hit it again!

859
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,919
(door banging)

860
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,382
I've got to see
your hideousness.

861
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,718
And you've got to see mine.

862
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,639
I wonder which of
us is more awful.

863
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,688
Nothing you can be is more
terrible than what I am.

864
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,359
A head without a body.

865
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,073
A head that should
be in its grave.

866
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,660
I hate him.

867
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,539
I hate him for what
he's done to me.

868
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,126
Can your horror match mine?

869
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,962
(door banging)

870
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,632
Quiet, someone's coming.

871
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,654
I have come to
feed your friend.

872
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:13,659
While you feed yourself
with hate, it prefers food.

873
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,454
Your former sniveling
fear becomes you more.

874
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:19,039
Eh.

875
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,840
What makes you think I'm
afraid of what's in there?

876
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,259
Or of you?

877
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,178
A mere head in
search of a body.

878
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,558
People fear what
they don't understand.

879
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:39,977
And what they can't see.

880
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,771
Oh, what are
you talking about?

881
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,442
You're nothing but
a freak of life!

882
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,902
And a freak of death!

883
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,448
Why should I be afraid of
a few knocks on a door?

884
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,867
But last night you ran.

885
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,871
You were afraid of what you
imagined lay behind that door.

886
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:00,497
I?

887
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,751
Imagined?

888
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:08,255
It was I who helped graft
together the bits and pieces

889
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:09,798
that were stolen
from the hospital.

890
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,885
An amputated arm,
a leg, a torso.

891
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,303
It was I who helped
piece 'em together

892
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,513
like a monstrous jigsaw puzzle!

893
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,808
And that same medicine
that he's fed to me

894
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,603
to activate my lymphoid tissues.

895
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,605
Has he fed it to that?

896
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,398
No.

897
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,651
No, on that he used
an earlier formula.

898
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,821
It wasn't as successful as
the serum he's using on you.

899
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:36,200
But it was enough to allow
the transplants to take.

900
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,454
If your experiment
is successful...

901
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:45,167
oh, then it'll be my turn.

902
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:47,586
And what else
has happened to it?

903
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,632
What do you mean,
what else?

904
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,302
Well, it's...

905
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,971
It's mutated some, of course.

906
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,934
It's changed considerably.

907
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,646
Why don't you open the door?

908
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,482
Then we'll both see
how it's changed.

909
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,484
Listen, you.
I warned you.

910
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,903
You better stop pestering me,
do you hear?

911
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:16,031
I'm getting fed up with you
and your insidious talk.

912
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,825
He should've cut out your
tongue while he was at it!

913
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,494
Afraid?

914
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,497
Afraid of whom?

915
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,581
Of you?

916
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,416
No.

917
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,335
Not anymore.

918
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,003
But of it?

919
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,882
Nor of it.

920
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,645
He only keeps it
locked in there so that...

921
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,523
it will be safe,
that's all.

922
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,066
Safe?

923
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:53,485
From me?

924
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:58,031
(laughs)

925
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,701
Oh, you beast.

926
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,581
I hope he prolongs your
existence into a lifetime

927
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,623
of agony.

928
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,625
Then we'll see who's
laughing at whom!

929
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,836
You miserable fool!

930
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:11,795
(Jan): Get him!

931
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:16,633
(frightening music)
(screaming)

932
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,429
Get him!

933
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,015
Oh my arm, oh!

934
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:27,519
(screaming)

935
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,188
Kill him!

936
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:41,617
(gasping)

937
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:51,436
(laughing)

938
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:55,857
(gasping)

939
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,267
You and your
father live here?

940
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,643
Only on weekends
when we wanna get away

941
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:14,644
from the city.

942
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,148
This place
certainly is lonely.

943
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:20,192
Well, the further from
prying eyes the better.

944
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,027
I mean it's nice
and quiet here,

945
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,237
we can get away from
the noise and telephones.

946
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:25,614
Oh, I guess it is.

947
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:28,241
Well, sit down, sit down,
I'll fix us a drink, huh?

948
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,368
My father should be back soon.

949
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,413
You mean he's not here now?

950
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,999
Oh, come on now, Doris.

951
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:38,710
Do I look like a maniac who
goes around killing girls?

952
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,629
Now, you've got to
learn to trust people.

953
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,339
Well, people like me, really.

954
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:45,133
Oh, I'm sorry.
I trust you.

955
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,719
I trust you with my life.

956
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,138
Well, I can't ask
for anymore than that.

957
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:55,018
I'll be right back.

958
01:11:55,228 --> 01:12:03,228
(ominous music)

959
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,436
(gasps)

960
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:46,731
Oh, I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

961
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:48,233
Forgotten you?

962
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,235
Oh, Doris, you've become
very important to me.

963
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,528
Very important.

964
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:52,779
I put a little water in
it, so it wouldn't be

965
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:53,989
too strong for you.

966
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:56,491
Fine, I'm not a
very heavy drinker.

967
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:57,742
Neither am I.

968
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:01,162
Well, um,
here's to your future.

969
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:02,622
Whatever it may be.

970
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,750
I'll drink to that.

971
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,960
(glasses clink)

972
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:26,855
(machines whirring)

973
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:46,082
(swanky jazz music)

974
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,051
Oh, it's getting
awfully warm in here.

975
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,555
(swanky jazz music)

976
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,034
I feel kind of funny.

977
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:38,718
Bill?

978
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,680
You put something in my drink!

979
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,391
Didn't you?

980
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,603
(glass shattering)

981
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,679
I told you I'd
bring you a body.

982
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,224
A beautiful one.

983
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,269
Soon it will be yours.

984
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,312
(Jan): Bill, you can't!

985
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:32,689
Yes, I can!

986
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,568
I want you as a complete woman,
not part of one.

987
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,198
Is it a crime to
wanna keep you alive?

988
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,287
Is it a crime for science
to jump ahead by years?

989
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,541
This kind of thing must be done.

990
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,753
When it's over, you'll see.

991
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,465
I've got to hurry now.

992
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,676
The drug will wear off
soon and she'll be awake.

993
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,014
When she does come to,

994
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,101
it will be your head
consciously awakening for her.

995
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:14,480
(anticipatory music)

996
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,764
You must be stopped!

997
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,892
You must!

998
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,310
And who's going to do it?

999
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:54,938
Now it's got to be quiet here.

1000
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:57,857
You can't stop me.

1001
01:18:58,776 --> 01:18:59,817
Very well.

1002
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,095
(banging on door)

1003
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,479
(banging)

1004
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:13,057
(rumbling)
(gasping)

1005
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,373
(chemicals exploding)

1006
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:42,045
(scuffling)

1007
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:54,849
(screaming)

1008
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:58,186
(fire crackling)

1009
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,126
(screaming)

1010
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,091
I told you to let me die.

1011
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:18,099
(Jan laughing)
