1
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,463
Gentlemen, the colonel.

2
00:01:58,504 --> 00:02:00,295
Gentlemen...

3
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:02,562
this is war...

4
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,231
and war on the continent.

5
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,234
The regiment has its sailing orders.

6
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:12,937
We entrain at dawn for France.

7
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:18,242
Upon you, gentlemen,
depends the scotch tradition.

8
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:20,409
You are the descendants

9
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,712
of those highland chieftains

10
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,914
who rallied behind Wallace

11
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,482
and who conquered under Bruce.

12
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:31,251
Your forefathers

13
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:34,354
risk their honor in your keeping.

14
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:38,190
I know that you will preserve it

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,692
with integrity.

16
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,194
I know that you will not fail

17
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,229
those faithful highland men

18
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,264
who look to your names for leadership.

19
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:51,900
It would be idle for me to warn you

20
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,370
that this will be no border skirmish.

21
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,707
We go to meet highly-trained,

22
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:04,444
perfectly armed soldiers...

23
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:07,446
the best organized army in the world.

24
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,948
A European war

25
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,785
promises to be long and bitter.

26
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:17,954
It may not be given us

27
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,223
to survive the victory.

28
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,225
It will be our portion

29
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:26,961
to show the way to
the armies who will follow us.

30
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:30,931
Scotland expects no more from you

31
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,766
than your fathers always have given...

32
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:35,968
that you will fight bravely

33
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:38,236
for the honor of the highlands,

34
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:40,271
for the protection of your people,

35
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:43,847
and for your loyalty to his majesty.

36
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:49,352
- The King!
- The King!

37
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:50,837
David my lad, how about a song?

38
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:11,045
> Maxwellton braes

39
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,680

> where early falls the dew...

41
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,452
The field marshal's compliments, sir.

42
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:23,021
Will captain King report at once?

43
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,023
My respects to the field marshal.

44
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,099
Captain King?

45
00:05:29,936 --> 00:05:34,763
Kindly report at white hall.

46
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:38,066
- Immediately?
- Immediately, sir.

47
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,935
> Gave me

48
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:44,003

> and for Bonnie...

54
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:04,016
It's evidently very urgent.

55
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:06,693
With your permission, sir.

56
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:15,625
> I lay me

70
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:28,619
- Captain King?
- Yes, sir.

71
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,849
> There's no place

72
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:39,052

> like home.

78
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:00,534
then why don't you go home?

79
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:03,043
Blasted, what's the matter wit' ya?

80
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,939
I don't think he likes music.

81
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,942
> Now break the news

00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:14,919

83
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,714
- Captain King?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,849
This way, please.

85
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,525
Captain King.

86
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,931
Captain King, sir.

87
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:40,468
Presently.

88
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,500
Have a chair, King.

89
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,008
Thank you, sir.

90
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,938
You've filled out in 10 years.

91
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:59,539
You were a slender sub-lieutenant

92
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,782
when I visited your father's
regiment in peshawar.

93
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,976
Now let's see, King.

94
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:11,179
Your permanent regiment is the black watch.

95
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:13,114
Yes, sir.

96
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:15,149
But for the past six years,

97
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,952
you've been attached to the khyber rifles.

98
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:21,820
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,823
You've spoken the Indian border dialects

100
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,992
- since boyhood?
- I was born there, sir.

101
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:33,503
Pashto, hindustani
and the rest like a native?

102
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,005
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,175
Well, King.

104
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:57,543
A very serious situation exists here.

105
00:09:57,553 --> 00:10:01,980
We are stripping
India of troops for France,

106
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,624
leaving the frontier weakly guarded.

107
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:16,289
A holy war starting here

108
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:20,126
in territory not under British rule

109
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,827
would be ruinous!

110
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:26,063
These hillmen have always been troublesome.

111
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:30,032
But now we find they are led by some woman

112
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,200
known as yasmani.

113
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,003
It appears she claims

114
00:10:36,013 --> 00:10:38,839
some mysterious origin.

115
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:43,008
At any rate, she has such
an extraordinary personality

116
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,845
that she can sway these fanatics

117
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:50,013
to hail her as their leader

118
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:52,215
and obey her rule.

119
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:55,925
They hail her as a goddess.

120
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:00,220
Now at any moment

121
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,324
she may lead her fanatical hordes

122
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:06,958
down the khyber pass,

123
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:11,962
which would give over
our peaceful subjects of India

124
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,931
to the horrors

125
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,107
of a holy war.

126
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,870
They look to us for protection

127
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,113
and we won't let them down.

128
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,275
Your mission will be

129
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:33,152
to prevent that holy war.

130
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:40,117
But, sir, I'm leaving tomorrow

131
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,719
with the regiment for France.

132
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,120
You're not leaving for France, King.

133
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,322
You're leaving for India.

134
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,925
Your mission is secret,

135
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:54,093
so that you may not explain to anyone

136
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:57,162
that you're not just slinKing away,

137
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:00,131
not even to your own brother officers.

138
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:04,400
You're going under a cloud...

139
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,110
Alone.

140
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:25,791
Don't ask this, sir.

141
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,085
You know our family.

142
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:32,954
There's been a King with
the regiment in every war.

143
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:35,756
Your father wouldn't have said that, King.

144
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:39,000
He was a soldier and he obeyed orders.

145
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,870
Is this an order, sir?

146
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:47,139
It's an order.

147
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,079
I'm ready for duty, sir.

148
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,806
Ah, King, you're back.

149
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:42,075
You're just in time for a deoch andoris.

150
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:44,843
My request for reassignment
to the khyber rifles

151
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,244
has been approved, sir.

152
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:49,080
Orders will be forwarded within an hour.

153
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,248
Your request, King?

154
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:54,524
My request, sir.

155
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:06,158
Then you won't be going
with the regiment tomorrow.

156
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:07,993
No, sir.

157
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:11,796
You're returning to India at this time

158
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:13,396
when your country has need

159
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:16,499
of every trained man she has in France?

160
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:19,176
I'm returning to India, sir.

161
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,045
Oh.

162
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,151
Sorry, King.

163
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,972
A nice place, India,

164
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:08,148
now that we're leaving for...

165
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,576
sing "auld lang syne," David.

166
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:13,978
Yes, David, "auld lang syne."

167
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:19,014

171
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:31,464
Donald?

172
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,027
Brother,

173
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,430
aren't you going with us to France?

174
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,399
No, laddie, I'm going to India.

175
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,402
But why?

176
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:52,572
I can't tell you.

177
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:54,973
But you'll be the soldier of the family

178
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,041
in this war, Malcolm.

179
00:15:57,051 --> 00:16:00,210
You'll do the fighting.

180
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,187
And you won't fail.

181
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:07,315
I won't fail.

182
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,117
Good boy.

183
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,552
Go inside, laddie.

184
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:15,028
Join your pals.

194
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:00,260
- Best of luck, boys!
- Good luck!

195
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,120
Company, right face!

196
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:21,018
And when you're in battle, my love,

197
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:24,053
do not forget you're a mactavish, Sandy!

198
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:27,056
And your wife is a macnabb!

199
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,824
Aye.

200
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,593
Eh, and Sandy, when you
get to Ken the Paris hussies,

201
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:36,163
do not forget you're a married man.

202
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,597
Aye!

203
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:41,066
Eh, and watch for when you sit down

204
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,435
and pull down your kilt.

205
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:48,038
Do not forget, you're
a member of the church.

206
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:49,639
And hide your shame.

207
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,106
Och, aye!

208
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,308
Eh, and do not forget

209
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:55,510
to give your rum ration

210
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,279
to some wee-bit drinkin' lad that needs it.

211
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,147
Aye, Jenny.

212
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:06,151
I'll give it to the first
wee drinkin' lad that needs it

213
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:08,153
worse than the mactavish!

214
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:10,587
You'd be as will!

215
00:19:10,597 --> 00:19:13,063
Dah!

216
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,458

217
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:21,093

sorry you're not going with us, King.

Well, cheerio, King!

231
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:14,164

243
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,099

Daddy! Daddy!

253
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,125
Take me with you, father.
Take me with you.

254
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:41,228
No no, Lassie, no.
Go on back to your mother.

255
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:42,862
She's waiting on you.

256
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:46,205
And give her this kiss for me.

257
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,902
Aye, sergeant,

258
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,170
bein' a bachelor,

259
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,771
you're Ken that a wee bit of war

260
00:21:57,781 --> 00:21:59,773
is a grand relief

261
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:02,375
to a married man.

262
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:04,884
Och, aye.

263
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,647
About face!

264
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:11,815
Entrain!

265
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:14,524
Top fellow!

266
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,521
All present and entrained, sir.

267
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:22,757
Very good.

268
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:25,358
I wish you very good luck, colonel.

269
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:27,935
Thank you.
Goodbye.

00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,969

275
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,682
oh, Angus! Angus!

276
00:23:35,692 --> 00:23:37,924
My poor wee baby!

277
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:44,157
For all the violence I have displayed

278
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,792
toward my fellow man,

279
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:50,068
Allah, forgive me.

280
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,026
Ho!

281
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:32,102
At ease.

282
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:44,670
- King, sahib.
- Mohammed Khan.

283
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,673
You're the last man
I expected to see in India.

284
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,808
I thought you were in France

285
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,983
with your lancers.

286
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,979
The raj deems me too old.

287
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:59,982
I, who first rode in battle

288
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:02,049
behind thy father

289
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,884
40 years ago.

290
00:27:03,894 --> 00:27:08,829
But King, sahib, why art
thou not with thy scots?

291
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:14,558
You and I have been shunted
from the real show

292
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:16,159
in flanders, Mohammed.

293
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:19,928
But there's a soldier's job in India

294
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,963
for both of us.

295
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,764
King, sahib!

296
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:26,933
There'll be no glory in it.

297
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:30,936
You'll not be riding at
the head of 100 lancers;

298
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:32,938
no pennant flying;

299
00:27:32,948 --> 00:27:35,914
no pipes playing.

300
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:42,718
A dirty job at the best.

301
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,548
Do you want to come along?

302
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,018
King, sahib, I have eaten thy salt

303
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:54,728
and thy father's salt.

304
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:10,207
Sahiba? Sahiba?

305
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:44,861
Yasmani, sahiba,

306
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:48,172
the strong one stands below.

307
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:22,110
Here comes that drunken
swine, captain King.

308
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,079
On hand as usual for his
evening's whiskey swilling.

309
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:29,082
By jove, he'll drink
himself out of the service.

310
00:30:29,092 --> 00:30:32,919
Yes, India is full of
such rotters since the war.

311
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:35,954
Well, slacKing is bad enough

312
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:39,123
without fraternizing with
these scurvy natives.

313
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,959
The scurvy native you refer to

314
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,961
is major Mohammed Khan,

315
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:47,964
who holds the highest rank possible

316
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,966
in his majesty's army...

317
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:52,834
a gallant soldier and a gentleman.

318
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:55,143
Good day, sir.

319
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,307
The general seems in a bit of a huff!

320
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:05,677
But you notice he didn't have a
good word to say for King, though.

321
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:07,679
No.

322
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:10,189
How are you, old chap?

323
00:31:13,126 --> 00:31:16,886
Boy, how about a peg of whiskey?

324
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:18,262
And soda.

325
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:26,928
My country has kept its promise.

326
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:31,472
Vast stores of ammunition
have reached the hills.

327
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:37,269
Arrange for our departure...

328
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,045
Shortly.

329
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:10,063
For a week past,

330
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:14,067
captain King has looked often

331
00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:15,943
at my window.

332
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:25,041
Thou shalt bring him to my house.

333
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:29,044
You are in danger here,

334
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:30,845
yasmani.

335
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:33,214
It is safer in the hills

336
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:36,490
among your tribesmen.

337
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,120
Safer for thee, rewa ghunga.

338
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,123
The British have no love for a native

339
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,466
conspiring against them.

340
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,397
Everything is in readiness...

341
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:02,168
munitions, guns,

342
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:04,936
your men.

343
00:33:04,946 --> 00:33:09,173
An empire is at stake.

344
00:33:09,183 --> 00:33:13,242
Thou shalt have princely power

345
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,944
in good time.

346
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:20,356
Bring captain King to me.

347
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,053
I say... I say,
you fellows,

348
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:47,496
I've just heard the most ripping story.

349
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:55,526
It concerns two irishmen, pat and Mike!

350
00:34:55,536 --> 00:34:58,328
Oh, don't go away!

351
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:02,598
Or rather I should say Patrick and Michael.

352
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:07,034
They were doing something.
I forget what they were doing.

353
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:09,403
But one said to the other,

354
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:11,037
"bi' cor' eye"...

355
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,605
excuse me, old chap, I've got a lot to do.

356
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:16,015
- I must go home.
- Excuse me.

357
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:27,282
I say, I've just heard

358
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,951
the most ripping story!

359
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,952
It concerns two irishmen...

360
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,962
some other time, old chap.

361
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:49,200
Boy,

362
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,975
two whiskeys and soda.

363
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:56,404
I'm not drinKing with you!

364
00:35:56,414 --> 00:36:01,040
I didn't ask for whiskey and soda for two.

365
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:05,652
I said, "two whiskeys
and soda."

366
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:13,124
It's very much like the...

367
00:36:16,562 --> 00:36:19,654
Yes, we have some quite dull evenings here.

368
00:36:19,664 --> 00:36:22,089
- You can come along sometime.
- Thank you.

369
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,092
We have all sorts of social

370
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,501
and sometimes regimental event...

371
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:32,997
your pardon, rewa ghunga?

372
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:35,132
But I was distracted

373
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:39,435
by captain King's drinKing again.

374
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:41,336
Unfortunate.

375
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:43,971
Odd...

376
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:47,039
He should be in India at this time.

377
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:51,009
Wasn't he with a scots regiment

378
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,277
when war broke out?

379
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:57,480
In this case, the war office

380
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,282
may have its own very good reasons

381
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:04,084
for transfer, rewa ghunga.

382
00:37:04,094 --> 00:37:05,285
Mmm.

383
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,553
I don't presume to know.

384
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:09,129
Quite so.

385
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:27,101
I say, King, that reminds me
of a ripping story

386
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,504
about two blackamoors, sambo and topsy.

387
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:34,206
Oh, keep your beastly stories to yourself.

388
00:37:34,216 --> 00:37:36,041
King! Gentlemen!

389
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,009
- Gentlemen, please!
- Really?

390
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,211
Well, you're a drunken bounder!

391
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:42,645
- You're a less-born...
- Now listen, King!

392
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,213
And a cad besides!

393
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:47,157
Yes, and you're a nasty,
filthy drunken swine!

394
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:53,395
Now listen, King!

395
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:57,723
- Colonel matranel?
- Sir?

396
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:02,427
What is the meaning of
this disgraceful conduct?

397
00:38:02,437 --> 00:38:05,863
Place captain King under arrest

398
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:08,464
and have him brought
to my office immediately.

399
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,165
Yes, sir.

400
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:13,535
Captain King?

401
00:38:13,545 --> 00:38:15,711
Follow me.

402
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:33,550
The fall must have
fractured his skull, sir.

403
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,893
He's dead.

404
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:40,321
Awkward mess.

405
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,532
Rewa ghunga?

406
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:53,899
Politics, out of the hands of the club.

407
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:55,900
I understand.

408
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,270
One expects such outbursts

409
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,573
from these virile Europeans.

410
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:05,374
This is a very serious business.

411
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:09,745
I feel very sorry for captain King.

412
00:39:09,755 --> 00:39:11,813
Oh, save your regrets.

413
00:39:11,823 --> 00:39:14,514
At last the service has the chance

414
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:17,583
of getting rid of a bounder.

415
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:19,685
Excuse me.

416
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,761
Certainly.

417
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:40,242
- That'll be all, men. You may go.
- Hurry! File out.

418
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,943
Now you understand, doctor,

419
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:55,479
neither now nor ever

420
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:58,715
may you disclose what has transpired.

421
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:00,482
I understand, sir.

422
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:03,551
Neither now nor ever.

423
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:04,952
Yes, sir.

424
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:07,963
And thank you for your help
in the matter too, doctor.

425
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,866
A capital bit of acting, King.

426
00:40:22,876 --> 00:40:24,868
Most convincing.

427
00:40:24,878 --> 00:40:26,903
But far too realistic, sir.

428
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:29,237
That punch almost fractured my jaw.

429
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:31,539
- Sorry, old man.
- Incidentally, twynes,

430
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:36,343
you will be buried with
full military honors tomorrow,

431
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,977
and for the benefit of yasmani's agents.

432
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,946
I'm sorry I can't attend
your funeral, old chap.

433
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,914
Now gentlemen, we have no time to waste.

434
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:46,649
Is rewa ghunga convinced
I'm a renegade, sir?

435
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:47,883
Without a doubt.

436
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:50,252
Then he'll rush the news to yasmani.

437
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:54,456
Yasmani is a woman enflamed with power.

438
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:57,257
You must realize, King,

439
00:40:57,267 --> 00:41:00,693
that the fanatical natives
regard her as a goddess,

440
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:02,961
a native Joan of arc.

441
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:05,362
Not quite saintly, though...

442
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:08,998
partial to stall with men.

443
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,001
If you should win her interest, King...

444
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,802
she has already shown interest, sir.

445
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:17,871
But I don't like the idea

446
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:20,240
of hiding behind a woman's skirts.

447
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,675
Oh, forget your schoolboy scruples.

448
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:25,243
This is war.
Yasmani is our enemy.

449
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:28,012
She threatens the country with disaster.

450
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:31,648
If her favor can further your mission,

451
00:41:31,658 --> 00:41:33,923
don't hesitate to use it.

452
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:40,487
This is the dirtiest job I've ever tackled.

453
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:42,921
But I'll see it through, sir.

454
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:44,956
Good. Now when you
get to the hills,

455
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:47,558
you'll destroy their ammunition dump.

456
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:50,960
Your job is to rob yasmani of her power.

457
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,996
And if I fail, sir?

458
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:55,964
Others will follow you.

459
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:59,000
Others have been before and never returned.

460
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,434
Oh, by the way,

461
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:05,512
the last was your old chum macgregor.

462
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:13,843
The best of luck, old man.

463
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:16,011
Thanks.

464
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:18,912
Major Mohammed Khan

465
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:22,015
with meet you with a detail
of lancers in the khyber.

466
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:26,019
> Number one and all's well!

467
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:28,420
the guard, sir...

468
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,930
has full instructions.

469
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:41,597
> Number two and all's well!

470
00:42:41,607 --> 00:42:44,808
ready, sir.

471
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:54,408
Here's for ye, Malcolm lad.

472
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:58,018
I won't fail you either.

473
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:01,713
Ready. Load.

474
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:04,623
Present. Fire.

475
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:15,863
Hide! Hide out!

476
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:20,884
Thou art a fugitive now, captain King?

477
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,021
A fugitive and a murderer.

478
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:50,032
I had heard.

479
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:53,109
But how?

480
00:44:56,713 --> 00:44:59,072
Quite so, captain King.

481
00:44:59,082 --> 00:45:01,982
I carried the news.

482
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:06,409
I must get out of India at once.

483
00:45:06,419 --> 00:45:09,011
They're yapping at my heels.

484
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:12,814
One can leave India

485
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:14,948
even now.

486
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:17,917
Yasmani!

487
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,952
That man,

488
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:23,955
he is no son of the prophet!

489
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:25,964
I command you...

490
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,968
command?

491
00:45:41,044 --> 00:45:45,137
Thou could'st find

492
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:47,973
riches and glory

493
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:50,575
in my service.

494
00:45:50,585 --> 00:45:52,976
In your service,

495
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:55,044
even death.

496
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:58,947
But it is not wise to lead an infidel

497
00:45:58,957 --> 00:46:01,949
among the faithful.

498
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:05,886
Infidel or not,

499
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,989
mine eyes have marked him

500
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,457
for my service.

501
00:46:11,467 --> 00:46:14,927
Mine eyes rove more

502
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:18,004
than becomes a goddess.

503
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:24,100
A caravan

504
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,803
travels through the khyber pass tonight

505
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:30,779
by a secret route.

506
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:37,651
Thou wilt join it.

507
00:46:57,002 --> 00:47:02,030
Thou hast the build of a man,

508
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,906
captain King.

509
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:16,073
In the hills

510
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:20,085
much will be revealed to thee.

511
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:29,083
You will meet many like yourself

512
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:32,853
in the hills, captain King...

513
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,922
soldiers, deserters,

514
00:47:36,932 --> 00:47:40,792
who fled after the climax

515
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:42,993
of a blood feud.

516
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:46,029
Those whom the British

517
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,940
call murderers.

518
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:55,951
- Och!
- Aye!

519
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,152
It's queer, sergeant, how a man

520
00:48:58,162 --> 00:49:00,354
gets out of touch with the world.

521
00:49:00,364 --> 00:49:04,024
I haven't even heard
Saturday's football results.

522
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:06,158
- Och, aye?
- Aye.

523
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:09,161
Have you heard from your brother, King?

524
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:10,962
Not a word.

525
00:49:10,972 --> 00:49:13,097
Well, don't worry.
He couldn't be

526
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:15,932
in a safer place than India.

527
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:19,869
If you don't stop your
slurs on Donald, I'll kill you.

528
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:22,004
Laddie laddie laddie.

529
00:49:22,014 --> 00:49:24,006
I swear I will!

530
00:49:24,016 --> 00:49:26,007
My brother is not a slacker.

531
00:49:26,017 --> 00:49:29,877
He... he wouldn't
fail me. He couldn't!

532
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:32,679
Steady, laddie, steady. You're
needin' a rest, I'm thinKing.

533
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:34,880
- But Donald is not a slacker.
- Of course he isn't.

534
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,882
You don't think my brother
would leave me...

535
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:39,050
wherever your brother is,
he's doing his job.

536
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,627
Now quiet down, laddie.
Have a fag.

537
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:47,064
I'm sorry, kid.

538
00:49:57,874 --> 00:50:00,141
Cigarette, Joe?

539
00:51:38,524 --> 00:51:41,992
Whoa! Whoa!

540
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:55,595
Who are you?

541
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:58,064
We are for the hills

542
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:01,067
and for her service.

543
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:04,602
What seek ye in her service?

544
00:52:04,612 --> 00:52:08,105
A mullah passing through our village

545
00:52:08,115 --> 00:52:12,074
promised us fighting and much loot

546
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:13,850
in the holy war.

547
00:52:15,854 --> 00:52:18,146
What proof have ye

548
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:19,981
of thy right to aid?

549
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:23,416
We have the tunic,

550
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:26,952
belt and the pistol

551
00:52:26,962 --> 00:52:30,421
of a British officer sahib

552
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:34,466
whom we have slain this night.

553
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,203
Ye are for the hills.

554
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:44,014
The way to the caves

555
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:46,349
is there.

556
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,185
But be warned:

557
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:52,254
Not all who enter

558
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:55,497
return by this road.

559
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:51,098
What horrible torture, Mohammed.

560
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:55,168
Who are those men opening that door

561
00:54:55,178 --> 00:54:58,043
on this terrible thing?

562
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,171
British soldiers, sahib,

563
00:55:02,181 --> 00:55:06,074
and loyal subjects of the raj

564
00:55:06,084 --> 00:55:09,050
who have been taken prisoner.

565
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,015
Go faster!

566
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:20,058
Go!

567
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:38,172
- Macgregor?
- Sahib?

568
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,613
Macgregor?

569
00:55:57,623 --> 00:56:01,183
This is King...
Donald King.

570
00:56:01,193 --> 00:56:05,085
In God's name, be on your guard

571
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,161
- every second.
- Go go!

572
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:14,158
My eyes were put out
because I spied on them.

573
00:56:14,168 --> 00:56:18,162
All Europe is at war.
Your regiment is in France.

574
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:21,564
God be with them.

575
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:24,800
I'll get you out somehow.

576
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:29,337
Never mind me!
You carry on.

577
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:33,073
Carry on.

578
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,182
Carry on.

579
00:57:33,228 --> 00:57:36,186
It is written:

580
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:39,222
"Kill the unbeliever

581
00:57:39,232 --> 00:57:43,492
wheresoever thou shalt find them!

582
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,660
Make them prisoners

583
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,797
and despoil them.

584
00:57:50,807 --> 00:57:53,800
For whosoever shall fight

585
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,434
for the religion of Allah,

586
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:59,403
whether he be slain

587
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:02,873
or be victorious,

588
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:06,809
we shall surely give him

589
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:09,886
a great reward."

590
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:58,459
Summon all newcomers for judgment.

591
00:59:00,762 --> 00:59:04,756
And thou, the strong one...

592
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:07,900
who stands sponsor for thee?

593
00:59:13,405 --> 00:59:16,498
Why, you yourself

594
00:59:16,508 --> 00:59:18,899
stand sponsor for me, harrim bey.

595
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:21,201
Nay!

596
00:59:21,211 --> 00:59:24,204
I know nothing of thy worthiness.

597
00:59:24,214 --> 00:59:26,614
We must have proof!

598
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:46,194
I stand sponsor for him.

599
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:51,599
It is an honor.

600
00:59:57,872 --> 01:00:02,699
But has it not always

601
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:04,933
been our custom here

602
01:00:04,943 --> 01:00:07,936
for all newcomers

603
01:00:07,946 --> 01:00:10,846
to test their strength?

604
01:00:13,316 --> 01:00:17,318
Will you wrestle for our sport?

605
01:00:19,922 --> 01:00:22,388
You...

606
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:49,519
Hear me, my hillmen,

607
01:01:49,529 --> 01:01:52,996
my warriors.

608
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:59,658
The hour of the warrior is at hand.

609
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:02,961
Soon thou shalt taste

610
01:02:02,971 --> 01:02:05,996
the joys of battle.

611
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:08,832
The fruits of victory

612
01:02:08,842 --> 01:02:10,975
shall be thine.

613
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:16,537
Music will play softly

614
01:02:16,547 --> 01:02:20,541
for your ease.

615
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:23,509
And virgins

616
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:25,986
will dance for your desires.

617
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:36,853
Bull with a beard,

618
01:02:36,863 --> 01:02:39,689
he knows where the ammunitions are, sahib.

619
01:02:39,699 --> 01:02:41,723
- We get him.
- Sahib?

620
01:02:41,733 --> 01:02:44,567
Yasmani wishes to see you.

621
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:49,629
- Ready.
- All right, sahib.

622
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:53,506
Allow me to show you the way, captain King.

623
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:59,811
Thank you, rewa ghunga.

624
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:13,948
Take a squad, release the prisoners.

625
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,883
Bring macgregor sahib to me.

626
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:17,592
Sahib.

627
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,598
We follow bull with a beard.

628
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:56,912
Bull with a beard, where is the
ammunition thou promised us?

629
01:03:56,922 --> 01:03:59,648
There is no ammunition!

630
01:03:59,658 --> 01:04:02,050
I'll have thee hanged!

631
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,252
Aye, long have I desired

632
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:07,087
to trim thy glorious beard, harrim bey.

633
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,055
Thou dog!

634
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:11,991
I'll have thee boiled in oil!

635
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:14,967
- Oil!
- Oil, sire.

636
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:23,966
What a glorious beard. In all
my travels I have ne'er beheld

637
01:04:23,976 --> 01:04:28,803
so glorious, gorgeous beard as thine.

638
01:04:28,813 --> 01:04:31,839
I think it would look better curled.

639
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:34,148
Where is the ammunition?

640
01:04:49,262 --> 01:04:51,961
The ammunition is there.

641
01:05:04,975 --> 01:05:07,642
Ahhh!

642
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:27,985
Now we can talk, we three,

643
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:31,053
of glory, wealth

644
01:05:31,063 --> 01:05:33,897
and power.

645
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:47,207
I prefer to talk of something else.

646
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:52,970
Something else?

647
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,005
I thought we were going to talk

648
01:05:56,015 --> 01:05:58,607
of conquest

649
01:05:58,617 --> 01:06:01,042
with the wild tribesmen

650
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:03,744
pouring over defenseless India

651
01:06:03,754 --> 01:06:05,986
behind their goddess.

652
01:06:07,956 --> 01:06:11,950
It seems their goddess

653
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,026
is only a woman.

654
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:24,266
Still a goddess to them, rewa ghunga.

655
01:06:26,003 --> 01:06:29,963
They would tear any man limb from limb

656
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:31,973
at my command.

657
01:06:43,084 --> 01:06:46,043
Are we to lose an empire

658
01:06:46,053 --> 01:06:49,921
for a woman's desire?

659
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:21,180
Still an unsuited boy.

660
01:07:24,952 --> 01:07:27,118
Come closer.

661
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:38,993
The women of the Western world
have taught thee poorly.

662
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:48,033
The sign of the faithful
is not needed with me.

663
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,940
I summoned thee, captain King,

664
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:09,442
because Aryan blood flows in my veins

665
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,885
as in thine.

666
01:08:13,922 --> 01:08:18,048
A white woman in these hills?

667
01:08:18,058 --> 01:08:21,384
Yes, captain King...

668
01:08:21,394 --> 01:08:25,094
a white woman.

669
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:34,026
Into this land, Alexander the great

670
01:08:34,036 --> 01:08:37,095
led a mighty army

671
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:39,297
countless ages ago

672
01:08:39,307 --> 01:08:43,041
and took a wife from these northern hills.

673
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:47,103
From him

674
01:08:47,113 --> 01:08:50,213
I am descended.

675
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:56,042
I remember

676
01:08:56,052 --> 01:08:59,445
one of those early invasions of India

677
01:08:59,455 --> 01:09:02,447
had failed.

678
01:09:02,457 --> 01:09:05,183
There is a prophesy

679
01:09:05,193 --> 01:09:09,420
that when a woman of Alexander's line

680
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:14,089
shall find a mate ordained
to rule these tribesmen,

681
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:16,758
that conquest

682
01:09:16,768 --> 01:09:20,093
shall be fulfilled!

683
01:09:20,103 --> 01:09:22,061
So that is the reason

684
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:26,005
these hillmen acclaim you as their goddess.

685
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:32,235
I looked long for that mate

686
01:09:32,245 --> 01:09:36,972
who would fulfill the prophesy...

687
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:41,041
a leader, strong, brave,

688
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,183
white.

689
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:49,947
Allah has marked thee

690
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:52,190
for that glory.

691
01:10:02,501 --> 01:10:05,093
I have been lonely,

692
01:10:05,103 --> 01:10:07,968
captain King,

693
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:12,037
for I am a woman.

694
01:10:14,174 --> 01:10:17,032
It is not good to be a goddess

695
01:10:17,042 --> 01:10:20,935
when one is young...

696
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:24,038
cold, chaste

697
01:10:24,048 --> 01:10:26,180
and far off.

698
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:39,216
It is sweeter to be a woman

699
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:42,185
to one man

700
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:45,962
than a goddess to thousands.

701
01:11:23,097 --> 01:11:25,964
It can't be.

702
01:11:40,578 --> 01:11:44,071
Men have forgotten before.

703
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:47,973
Antony squandered an empire

704
01:11:47,983 --> 01:11:50,350
for Cleopatra's favor.

705
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:59,049
Am I less precious to thee

706
01:11:59,059 --> 01:12:02,919
than she was in his arms?

707
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:05,428
You don't understand.

708
01:12:08,231 --> 01:12:12,858
Since I saw thee first
'neath my window in peshawar,

709
01:12:12,868 --> 01:12:17,102
mine eyes have longed for thee.

710
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:50,957
- And guard them well.
- Salaam!

711
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:54,200
Guards, salaam!
Guards! Allah!

712
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:06,134
For all the violence I have displayed

713
01:13:06,144 --> 01:13:08,169
towards my fellow man,

714
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:10,279
Allah forgive me.

715
01:13:16,952 --> 01:13:21,111
We ride down the khyber
at the head of my hillmen...

716
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:23,947
Together

717
01:13:23,957 --> 01:13:28,017
to win an empire by the dawn.

718
01:13:28,027 --> 01:13:29,685
I will go with you,

719
01:13:29,695 --> 01:13:32,453
follow you anywhere.

720
01:13:32,463 --> 01:13:36,123
But we can't turn
those wild tribesmen loose

721
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:39,291
to ravish a peaceful country.

722
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:42,961
It only means killing...

723
01:13:42,971 --> 01:13:46,038
needless cruelty.

724
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,965
Empires are not won

725
01:13:49,975 --> 01:13:53,234
by mercy, Donald.

726
01:13:53,244 --> 01:13:57,012
The thought of such conquest is madness.

727
01:13:59,382 --> 01:14:02,041
It is wisdom.

728
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:06,178
Now is the appointed time.

729
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:09,246
Europe is destroying herself

730
01:14:09,256 --> 01:14:11,982
as the prophesy foretold.

731
01:14:11,992 --> 01:14:16,085
Her best sons are dying like flies.

732
01:14:16,095 --> 01:14:19,088
I have seen it.

733
01:14:19,098 --> 01:14:21,665
I will show you.

734
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:33,733
Look.

735
01:14:33,743 --> 01:14:38,177
Hold my hands...

736
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:44,240
Tightly.

737
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,016
Concentrate.

738
01:14:48,586 --> 01:14:51,579
Think of those men

739
01:14:51,589 --> 01:14:54,747
you used to know,

740
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:59,717
unfortunates being mowed down

741
01:14:59,727 --> 01:15:02,618
in the mud of flanders.

742
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:04,753
Think...

743
01:15:04,763 --> 01:15:09,065
think of those men.

744
01:15:11,135 --> 01:15:13,634
Think of those men...

745
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:33,749
Come on, boys!

746
01:15:49,431 --> 01:15:52,064
Come on!

747
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,606
Take me with you, father.

748
01:16:51,616 --> 01:16:53,415
Take me with you.

749
01:17:02,824 --> 01:17:04,781
Sorry we're late, sir.

750
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:07,350
Quite all right.
Carry on.

751
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,493
Very good, sir.

752
01:18:07,678 --> 01:18:08,868
Malcolm.

753
01:18:08,878 --> 01:18:11,337
Are you hard hit, laddie?

754
01:18:11,347 --> 01:18:13,914
Malcolm, lad!

755
01:18:29,628 --> 01:18:32,020
That was my regiment...

756
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,822
the black watch.

757
01:18:35,832 --> 01:18:39,625
My brother is wounded,

758
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:42,294
perhaps dead.

759
01:18:42,304 --> 01:18:46,796
And I've been lying here

760
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:49,398
forgetting everything...

761
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:53,934
duty, honor, loyalty;

762
01:18:53,944 --> 01:18:58,045
faithless to my trust.

763
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:05,842
Donald,

764
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:07,844
am I not thine?

765
01:19:07,854 --> 01:19:09,986
And art thou not mine?

766
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:16,350
I was sent here to betray you,

767
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,954
rob you of your power
to prevent this holy war.

768
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:24,656
Thy mission was known to me.

769
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:27,692
But it mattered not,

770
01:19:27,702 --> 01:19:29,994
for Allah sent thee to me.

771
01:19:30,004 --> 01:19:32,937
It can't be.

772
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,004
Don't go.

773
01:19:44,014 --> 01:19:46,973
Thou art but one man

774
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:49,483
against these merciless thousands.

775
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,689
Everything's in readiness, sahib.

776
01:20:09,699 --> 01:20:11,891
We found the guns and ammunition.

777
01:20:11,901 --> 01:20:14,493
- Good. Macgregor?
- Has been freed, sahib.

778
01:20:14,503 --> 01:20:17,895
- Splendid.
- We stole it from thy quarters, sahib.

779
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:19,930
Thank you. Now everybody
to the top of the steps now.

780
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,998
Hurry! Guns in position.

781
01:20:22,008 --> 01:20:25,041
- Release the prisoner.
- You take the right, the left.

782
01:20:28,545 --> 01:20:31,738
For all the violence I have displayed

783
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:36,041
toward my fellow man...

784
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:39,018
Allah, forgive me.

785
01:20:48,528 --> 01:20:50,693
Hands to the right.

786
01:20:52,997 --> 01:20:56,597
Everybody, ready!

787
01:20:57,933 --> 01:21:01,993
Come on, step to it.
Machine guns.

788
01:21:02,003 --> 01:21:05,160
- 1! 2! 3! 4!
- Sahib!

789
01:21:08,473 --> 01:21:11,899
- Where have you been?
- Praying, sahib.

790
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:15,009
Take the left flank.

791
01:21:21,884 --> 01:21:23,708
- Macgregor.
- King.

792
01:21:23,718 --> 01:21:25,810
Put this in your hand, Mac.

793
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,412
- Thank you.
- Doesn't it feel good?

794
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:31,481
There they are, Mac, in front of you.

795
01:21:31,491 --> 01:21:33,081
Kneel.

796
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:35,750
It'll be hot in a minute.

797
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,960
Sahib.

798
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:50,128
Yasmani, those machine guns
are in position.

799
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:53,598
It would mean needless
slaughter to oppose us now.

800
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,766
You can prevent it.

801
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:58,068
At your bidding, your hillmen

802
01:21:58,078 --> 01:22:00,669
would lay down their arms and disperse.

803
01:22:00,679 --> 01:22:02,645
Will you give the word?

804
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:11,051
Thou hast triumphed.

805
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:40,442
Art thou my followers?

806
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:45,938
Wilt thou obey my command?

807
01:22:45,948 --> 01:22:47,940
Aye!

808
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:52,810
Lay down your arms and disperse!

809
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,820
The traitoress!

810
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,798
Stand fast, Mac.
You're in charge now.

811
01:23:59,808 --> 01:24:02,108
Stand up, buddy.

812
01:24:04,645 --> 01:24:08,613
Bayonets, en guard.

813
01:24:16,221 --> 01:24:18,286
Yasmani?

814
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,919
My soul

815
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:29,921
is long for thee,

816
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:31,997
Donald.

817
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:39,235
My head has rested on thy breast.

818
01:24:41,272 --> 01:24:45,907
My lips have burned on thine.

819
01:24:47,976 --> 01:24:49,934
Henceforth,

820
01:24:49,944 --> 01:24:53,804
no other woman's lips

821
01:24:53,814 --> 01:24:55,971
can kiss thee

822
01:24:55,981 --> 01:25:00,316
without thou be reminded of me.

823
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:08,013
Thy memory of yasmani

824
01:25:08,023 --> 01:25:11,924
will never die.

825
01:25:15,929 --> 01:25:18,922
King...

826
01:25:18,932 --> 01:25:20,998
Sahib.

827
01:25:53,061 --> 01:25:56,220
Mohammed,

828
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:59,756
send one of your men

829
01:25:59,766 --> 01:26:03,125
to the general office of command

830
01:26:03,135 --> 01:26:07,069
in northwest frontier.

831
01:26:08,772 --> 01:26:13,332
Have him deliver this message:

832
01:26:13,342 --> 01:26:16,068
"The job

833
01:26:16,078 --> 01:26:18,278
is finished.

834
01:26:19,947 --> 01:26:21,905
King."

835
01:26:21,915 --> 01:26:24,115
Sahib.

836
01:26:38,928 --> 01:26:41,929
Gentlemen, the colonel.

837
01:26:46,767 --> 01:26:48,959
Gentlemen,

838
01:26:48,969 --> 01:26:52,062
it's but a few minutes midnight,

839
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:54,964
the beginning of a new year

840
01:26:54,974 --> 01:26:59,033
and the hour for renewing old friendships

841
01:26:59,043 --> 01:27:04,004
and re-pledging ancient loyalties.

842
01:27:04,014 --> 01:27:07,806
During the long relentless months of war,

843
01:27:07,816 --> 01:27:10,408
the regiment

844
01:27:10,418 --> 01:27:14,111
has upheld the bravest
traditions of our country.

845
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:17,079
I salute you, gentlemen,

846
01:27:17,089 --> 01:27:19,948
on behalf of those highland chieftains

847
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:23,984
whose honor you have so ably preserved,

848
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:27,220
and for your loyalty to his majesty

849
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,663
the King.

850
01:27:30,999 --> 01:27:33,064
The King!

851
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:44,017
King!

852
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,193
King? King?

853
01:28:55,736 --> 01:28:59,028
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

854
01:28:59,038 --> 01:29:02,064
My request for reassignment to
the black watch has been approved.

855
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:05,966
I'm reporting for duty, sir.

856
01:29:05,976 --> 01:29:08,234
The latest "gazette"

857
01:29:08,244 --> 01:29:12,204
has news of interest for you gentlemen.

858
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:16,006
Major King of the black watch

859
01:29:16,016 --> 01:29:18,942
has been awarded the D.S.O.

860
01:29:18,952 --> 01:29:23,286
For gallant service to the crown in India.

861
01:29:24,955 --> 01:29:26,746
Glad you're back, King.

862
01:29:26,756 --> 01:29:29,021
Thank you, sir.

863
01:29:32,059 --> 01:29:35,184
- Just like old times.
- David,

864
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:38,027
do you feel equal to it?

865
01:29:39,797 --> 01:29:44,724

Happy new year!
