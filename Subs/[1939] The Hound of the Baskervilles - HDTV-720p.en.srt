<b>01 Sherlock Holmes And The Hound
Of The Baskervilles 1939 English.</b>

2
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,969
Hello there?

3
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,429
Hello there, is something wrong?

4
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,069
My wife and I found him
lying dead in the yew alley,

5
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,199
face downward.

6
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,409
What did you do then?

7
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,119
I hurried across the moor to
fetch the doctor, Dr. Mortimer.

8
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,519
He was at dinner with
Miss Stapleton and her brother.

9
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,379
Very well, Barryman, that's all.

10
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,109
Yes, sir.

11
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,759
Dr. Mortimer,

12
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,429
to what do you attribute
the death of Sir Charles?

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,969
Heart failure, sir.

14
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,899
I might add that for some time Sir Charles
was in a highly nervous state, worried.

15
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,439
Something was preying
on his mind.

16
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,989
And did he confide to you
what was preying on his mind?

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,869
Well...

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,079
- No.
- Well then, what about those footprints, Mortimer?

19
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,829
As though Sir Charles had been
tiptoeing back towards the house?

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,659
I examined them myself,
and as a man of science, I...

21
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,079
So did I, Mr. Stapleton.

22
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,130
- More likely, Sir Charles was running...
- Running?

23
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:06,049
Running from what?

24
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,259
If you please, gentlemen,
one at a time.

25
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,339
Why don't you tell the truth,
all of you,

26
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,509
tell all you know!

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,219
Silence, Mr. Franklin.

28
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,929
You've already testified.

29
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,180
You were not there, know nothing
whatever of this matter.

30
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:19,769
Nevertheless, I insist
he was murdered!

31
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,109
- Murdered, I tell you!
- That will do, sir, that will do.

32
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,399
- There were no marks on the body of any kind, Dr. Mortimer?
- None.

33
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,319
Then as his physician, what would you say
was the cause of Sir Charles' death?

34
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,509
Most emphatically
a heart failure, sir.

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,329
Such then gentlemen, is the
verdict of this coroner's court.

36
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,499
Call it what you like.
Sir Charles was murdered.

37
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,959
There's more than one
person in this room,

38
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,109
knows I speak the truth.

39
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,209
I'm blasted if I know why on earth
you want all these clippings

40
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,829
about this Baskerville fellow.

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,160
I have an idea, Watson, that
young Sir Henry isn't destined

42
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,669
for a very long existence
in this world.

43
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,919
What?

44
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,089
My conjecture is
that he'll be murdered.

45
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,219
Murdered?

46
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,079
It would be very interesting to
see if my deductions are accurate.

47
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,349
Oh, Mr. Holmes,

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,840
while you were out a gentleman
called to see you and left this.

49
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:48,269
He asked you to give it to me?

50
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,939
- Oh, no, sir, he just left it by mistake, I imagine.
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,609
A Dr. Mortimer?

52
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,649
He didn't leave his name, sir.

53
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,659
- No, it's here on the stick, Mrs. Hudson.
- Oh, is it, I didn't notice.

54
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,199
Do you know any
Dr. Mortimer, Watson?

55
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,579
No? What did he want?

56
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,289
He didn't say, sir.

57
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,540
What do you make of it, Watson?

58
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,329
Why should I make
anything of it?

59
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,780
- The fellow came to see you.
- Ah, but what kind of a fellow?

60
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:09,419
Let me hear you reconstruct him
from his walking stick

61
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,259
by our usual method of
elementary observation.

62
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,259
Well, I should say that
Dr. Mortimer is a successful man,

63
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,679
- well esteemed.
- Good, excellent.

64
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,469
I should say that he does a great
deal of his visiting on foot,

65
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,099
- because the iron ferrule is worn down.
- Perfectly sound.

66
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,309
Let's have a look at
this inscription.

67
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,649
"From his friends
of the C.C.H ."

68
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,029
C.C.H.

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,699
I should say that's the
something or other hunt.

70
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,109
Really, Watson,
you've excelled yourself.

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,619
Does anything escape me?

72
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,989
- Almost everything, my dear fellow.
- What?

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,749
A present to a doctor I'd say is more
likely to come from a hospital than a hunt.

74
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,579
And when the letters "C.C"
are placed before the hospital,

75
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,129
the name Cherring Cross Hospital
rather obviously presents itself.

76
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,169
Oh, okay, you may be right.

77
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,379
Furthermore I'd say that Dr. Mortimer
had a small practice in the country

78
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,389
- and was the owner of a dog.
- How can you tell that?

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,389
Quite simple,
from the teeth marks.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,929
Look, you can see for yourself.

81
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,179
A rather large dog, I'd say,

82
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,849
and unless I'm mistaken, Dr. Mortimer
will call on us again in a few moments.

83
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,109
Rubbish, Holmes, rubbish.

84
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,729
How the devil
can you deduce that?

85
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,069
Well, as he left his stick,
isn't it reasonable to presume

86
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
that he'll come back and get it?

87
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,353
Dr. Mortimer, sir.

88
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,659
Mr. Holmes?

89
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,369
Yes, come in, Dr. Mortimer.

90
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,980
- I took the liberty of calling upon you...
- And left your stick.

91
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,959
Oh, so I did. Thank you so much.

92
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,169
A presentation, I see.

93
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,779
Yes, sir,
from Cherring Cross Hospital.

94
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,799
This is my friend, Dr. Watson.

95
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,089
Of course.

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,299
How do you do, sir.

97
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,719
Mr. Holmes,

98
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,639
you're the one man in all
England who can help me.

99
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,929
Well, won't you sit down?

100
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,729
Thank you.

101
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,979
A friend of mine
is in grave danger.

102
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,359
- May I inquire his name?
- Sir Henry Baskerville.

103
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,099
The Heir to the Estate
of Baskerville Hall.

104
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,239
I'm in mortal fear Sir Henry's
life will be stuffed out.

105
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,329
Why, what makes you think that?

106
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,060
I have information which leads me
to believe that for centuries past,

107
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,249
every Baskerville who
has inherited the estates

108
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,209
has met with a violent,
and sudden death.

109
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,169
But as I recall it, Sir Charles died
from natural causes, heart failure.

110
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,799
Apparently, and that was
the verdict of the coroner,

111
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,849
in which I, Sir Charles'
physician, concurred,

112
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,059
but there was one point which
I kept back from the police,

113
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,219
from everybody.

114
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,639
Yes?

115
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,149
About 50 yards from where
Sir Charles fell dead

116
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,069
were footprints.

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,729
A man's or a woman's?

118
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,279
Mr. Holmes, they were the
footprints of a gigantic hound.

119
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,819
A hound?

120
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,159
Well, why didn't you report it?

121
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,739
Not a soul
would have believed it.

122
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,329
And during the night it rained.

123
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,580
And in the morning the marks
were completely obliterated,

124
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,289
but I saw them
as clearly as I see you.

125
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,629
And then a few days ago, as one
of the executors of the estate,

126
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,719
I found this.

127
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,589
This old document.

128
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,259
"Legend of the
Hound of the Baskervilles."

129
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,309
Let me read it to you,
Mr. Holmes,

130
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,599
it's quite short.
I won't bore you, I promise.

131
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,769
Yes, please, go on.

132
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,609
"In the time of the
Great Rebellion, about 1650,."

133
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,319
Baskerville Manor was held
by Hugo of that name,

134
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,239
a profane and godless man.

135
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,329
One Michaelmas, Mr. Hugo stalled
out of a neighbouring farm

136
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,369
and carried off
the daughter of the house.

137
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,119
He locked her
in an upper chamber,

138
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,419
and while Hugo and his friends
were carousing

139
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,929
"as was their nightly custom..."

140
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,599
Such a cuddle some little wench
never existed before, I swear.

141
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,059
Cheeks soft as velvet.
A form so wondrously rounded.

142
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,809
- Tell us more.
- What happened then?

143
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,689
- Where was I?
- The form, you were saying.

144
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,189
Oh, yeah.

145
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,029
No need to cry out, I told her.
Hugo will not hurt you.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,859
With that, I whisked
her up on my saddle,

147
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,239
covered her with my cloak
and we were off like the wind.

148
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,369
- You brought her here?
- To the Manor?

149
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,289
- Where is she?
- Go fetch her, Hugo.

150
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,039
Easier said than done, eh, Hugo?

151
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,619
How can he fetch her
if she isn't here?

152
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,169
She isn't, eh?

153
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,469
Come on, I'll show you.

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,309
May we come in, my sweet?

155
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,479
These drunken sots
will give Hugo the...

156
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,769
There is no girl.

157
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,579
Gone!

158
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,189
Gone.

159
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,919
Get out of my way.

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,039
Tim! Danny!

161
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,659
- Yes, Sir Hugo.
- What's wrong, sir?

162
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,159
She's gone, the wench.

163
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,299
Well, don't stand there gaping,
go bring my mare.

164
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,919
What's wrong?

165
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,549
I've never seen him
in such a rage.

166
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,839
Where's he gone?

167
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,919
Lets follow him.

168
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,339
- Lets go, Roderick.
- Farewell.

169
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,279
Come on, Matthew.

170
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,389
Hold it still, you blockhead.

171
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,439
I'll give my soul to the devil
for that wench!

172
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,010
Did you hear how he pledged his
soul to the devil for that wench?

173
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:26,463
Well, may he find her and wed her.
Then the devil will have his soul.

174
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,239
"On and on they road,

175
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,849
until suddenly they came
upon the body of the girl."

176
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,989
Dead.

177
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,009
"Then, from just over a rise,
they heard sounds so hideous"

178
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,099
that the blood froze
in their veins,

179
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,819
"and looking up, they beheld..."

180
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,859
"Before we could get at him,
Sir Hugo was dead,"

181
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,899
his body literally
torn to shreds.

182
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,659
Such is the history of the hound

183
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,489
that has cursed the
Baskerville family ever since.

184
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,909
Many having been
unhappy in their death,

185
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,069
"that have been sudden,
violent, and mysterious."

186
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,299
Well, Mr. Holmes?

187
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,799
Interesting.

188
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,969
Very interesting.

189
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,799
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

190
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,219
But Sir Henry is arriving
from Canada tomorrow.

191
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,599
Please understand my dilemma,
my responsibility.

192
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,349
I was Sir Charles' best friend.

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,479
My duty is to protect that boy.

194
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,530
If I should take him down there
to Baskerville Hall,

195
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:47,191
- and anything happened to him...
- What I'd suggest, Dr. Mortimer,

196
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:49,279
is that when Sir Henry arrives,
you bring him here.

197
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,279
Oh, thank you,
thank you, Mr. Holmes.

198
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,609
You don't know what a load
you've taken off my mind.

199
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,119
- Good night, Dr. Watson.
- Good night, sir.

200
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,329
You've left your stick again.

201
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,209
Oh, thank you.

202
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,129
By the by, Dr. Mortimer,

203
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,959
you have a dog?

204
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,419
I have no dog.

205
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,879
Then how do you
account for these marks?

206
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,219
Evidently the teeth marks
of a dog.

207
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,009
I used to have a dog,

208
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,969
a small Spaniel,

209
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,639
but it died.

210
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,049
- Good night.
- Good night.

211
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,149
Well, Holmes,
what do you make of it?

212
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,159
Do you think there's
anything in it?

213
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:40,509
Good heavens, you're not going to start
scratching on that infernal thing, are you?

214
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,969
Dear old Watson.

215
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,569
Well, goodbye, Sir Henry.

216
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,529
If you ever go back to Canada,
be sure you sail with us.

217
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,989
Thanks,
you've all been wonderful.

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,119
Very best of luck, sir.

219
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,959
And the same to you, sir.

220
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,679
This way, Sir Henry.

221
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,119
Thank you, sir.

222
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,450
- And you.
- Thank you, Sir Henry.

223
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,243
- And you.
- Thank you, sir.

224
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,379
Sir Henry?
Oh, it's too bad it's all over,

225
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,929
just when you and Betsy Anne were
really getting to know each other.

226
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,969
Oh, but we are going to
see one another in London,

227
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,349
aren't we, Sir Henry?

228
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,929
Oh, I should love to,

229
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,479
but I have to go down to
the country, unfortunately.

230
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,689
To your ancestral estate?
How exciting.

231
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,559
Perhaps, Betsy Anne,
if you're very good,

232
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,069
Sir Henry will ask us
to visit him.

233
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,649
Of course, yes.

234
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,149
- We're staying at The Savoy.
- Don't forget.

235
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,959
- I won't.
- Bye.

236
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,679
Goodbye.

237
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,879
Sir Henry?

238
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,289
Yes.

239
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm Dr. Mortimer.
Your uncle was my best friend.

240
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:09,169
How do you do? Thank you
for coming to meet me.

241
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,379
Not at all, my dear boy.
Did you have a pleasant trip?

242
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,879
Splendid, thank you.

243
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,379
I've taken rooms for you at the
Northumberland Hotel,

244
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,709
where I'm stopping.

245
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,219
Fine.

246
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,270
I assume you'll be staying
in London for a few days?

247
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:22,559
Yes, I haven't seen it
since I was a boy.

248
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,239
- Thank you, sir.
- Northumberland Hotel.

249
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,019
Sir Charles' death was a
great personal loss to me.

250
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,919
I was more than his doctor...

251
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,719
What's this?

252
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,539
What are those words?

253
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,799
You mind, Sir Henry?

254
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,469
No, not at all.

255
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,259
What do you make of it,
Mr. Holmes?

256
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,349
Why do you think that last
word is printed in ink?

257
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,139
Oh, that's simple enough.

258
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,110
The words have been snipped
from The London Times,

259
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:09,729
that's evident
from the typography.

260
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,559
But the word "moor"
is an unusual word.

261
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,069
Your correspondent evidently
couldn't find it in the newspaper.

262
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,859
You'll admit, Dr. Mortimer, there's
nothing supernatural about this.

263
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,029
Supernatural?

264
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,449
Tell me, Sir Henry,

265
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,659
has anything else unusual
happened to you today

266
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,579
since your arrival in London?

267
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,489
I can't think of anything,

268
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,249
unless you'd say that losing
one of your boots is unusual.

269
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,589
- You lost one of your boots?
- Yes, and brand new ones too, never had them on.

270
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,240
I put them outside the door
to be cleaned,

271
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,441
and when I went to fetch them,
there was only one there.

272
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,929
Brand new boots and you
put them out to be cleaned?

273
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,679
They were tan ones, Dr. Watson.

274
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,179
It prevents them from scratching
to have them polished first.

275
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,849
Now will you please tell me
what this is all about?

276
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,889
Dr. Mortimer bringing me here
to see you, this letter?

277
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,649
It's about you, Sir Henry, your
inheritance in Baskerville Hall.

278
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,689
And Dr. Mortimer thinks that it might
not be safe for you to go down there.

279
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,029
- Safe?
- On account of a hound,

280
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,109
a wild, supernatural monster

281
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,949
that has cursed you Baskervilles
for the last two to 300 years.

282
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,829
Ho, ho, that sounds grand!
A family ghost, eh?

283
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,909
Why did you tell me about
this before, Dr. Mortimer?

284
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,409
Well, Mr. Holmes suggested...

285
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,379
He's going to tell you
about it now, Sir Henry.

286
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,339
Take him back to the hotel,
Dr. Mortimer.

287
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,089
Show him that old document tell him
everything, the whole business.

288
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,669
I'll join you a little later.

289
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,840
Come on, we'll stroll back.
You can tell me on the way.

290
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:25,219
This is not something to joke
about, Sir Henry, believe me.

291
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,509
See you presently.

292
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,929
Good night.

293
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,399
What's up?

294
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,069
Shh.

295
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,919
- Come on, Watson.
- What's up, now?

296
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,029
- Where are we going?
- You'll see soon enough.

297
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,789
We've not a moment to lose.

298
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,779
Newspaper.
Get your evening paper.

299
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,479
Keep your eye on that hansom.

300
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,999
This letter dates back
to about 1650.

301
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,239
Paper, get your evening paper.

302
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,909
Get your paper, evening paper.

303
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,489
Evening paper, sir,
get your evening paper.

304
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,199
Get your paper, evening paper.

305
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,539
Evening paper, sir?

306
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,390
Tells all the latest news
that's going on, sir.

307
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:38,249
- Tells you all about it.
- Thank you, sir.

308
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,809
Evening paper.

309
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,289
A dissident, drunken fellow...

310
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,229
He was a decadent...

311
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,319
Look out, stop!

312
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,929
Whip up, cabby. Whip up, I say.

313
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,609
Very good, sir.

314
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,909
- Who was it?
- I don't know, but it's just as I expected.

315
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,859
- Hadn't we better hurry on and warn them?
- No, no, no.

316
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,659
They're not in any danger now.

317
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,069
Here's the number
of that hansom.

318
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
Find out from Scotland Yard
who the cabbie is

319
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,601
and if you can,
fetch him along to the hotel.

320
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,293
I'll do my best.

321
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,839
Well, now that Dr. Mortimer
has told you everything,

322
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,879
what have you decided?

323
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,089
To go there, of course.

324
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,580
Good, that's what I thought
you'd say.

325
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:32,429
And if Dr. Mortimer
would only guarantee

326
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,599
that this supernatural hound
of his would really appear,

327
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,929
I'm all the ready.

328
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,229
Oh, don't say that, my boy.

329
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,880
Sounds like a bogey story they tell
kids to frighten them at night,

330
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,689
- isn't it, Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, rather.

331
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,319
It might interesting to know,
however,

332
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,899
that you were shadowed
from my house.

333
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,699
Shadowed?

334
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,110
Yes, and probably have been ever
since you arrived in London.

335
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:54,579
By whom?

336
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,369
I don't know.

337
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,209
A man in a hansom.

338
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,039
He must have seen me run after
him and have the cabbie dash off.

339
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,839
Oh, by the by.

340
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,299
- Did you ever discover your mislaid boot?
- No...

341
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,339
Hello.

342
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,469
The brown one's here,

343
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,719
but one of the black one's gone.

344
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,099
I'll ring for the chambermaid,
perhaps she can explain.

345
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,929
Yes, do.

346
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,939
Now, why should anyone
want to take an odd boot

347
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,229
and then exchange a
brand new one for an old one?

348
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,859
Can you explain it, Mr. Holmes?

349
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,609
No, no, I can't.

350
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,819
Come in?

351
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,199
Did you ring, sir?

352
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,199
Yes, about that boot of mine?

353
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,239
Oh, I haven't found it yet, sir. I've
made inquiries all over the hotel.

354
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,039
Well, it's back, the brown one, but
now one of my black one is gone.

355
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,619
Oh, sir, that is odd.

356
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,879
Who else except yourself
has access to this apartment?

357
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,209
Only the housekeeper, sir, and
she wouldn't do a thing like that.

358
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,380
- No, no, no, of course not.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir,

359
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:52,929
- I'll do my best to find your boot.
- All right, thanks.

360
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,060
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, Dr. Watson.

361
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:55,979
I've got him.

362
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,179
Come on in, Clayton.

363
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,479
Come this way.

364
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,099
- This is John Clayton, No. 2704.
- How do you do?

365
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,109
How do you do, Clayton?
Won't you sit down?

366
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,920
Won't keep you long,
it's good of you to come.

367
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:11,243
Thank you, sir.

368
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,449
Now, Clayton,

369
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,029
I wish you'd tell us
who your fare was

370
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,280
that watched a certain house
on Baker Street this evening

371
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:22,159
and later followed
these two gentlemen?

372
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,919
Well, you know
as much as I do, sir.

373
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,749
Not quite as much, I hope.

374
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,959
The gent said as though
he was a detective, sir.

375
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,549
- Oh, he did?
- Yes, sir.

376
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,299
How would you describe
this gentleman, Clayton?

377
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,639
He was I supposed about
35 years of age, sir,

378
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,099
and dressed like a toff.

379
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,059
Had a small black beard.

380
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,269
Colour of his eyes?

381
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,819
I can't say, sir.

382
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,609
I see.

383
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,399
When did he tell you
that he was a detective?

384
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,909
At the station, sir,

385
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,659
when he give me the two guineas
what he'd promised me.

386
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,659
Did he tell you his name?

387
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,119
Yes, sir.

388
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,209
- What did he say it was?
- Sherlock Holmes, sir.

389
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,419
- What?
- Well, that's the name what he gave me, sir.

390
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,589
Sherlock Holmes.

391
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,049
Well, whoever it is
at least has a sense of humour.

392
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,179
Here, Clayton, here's something
for your trouble.

393
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,349
Thank you, sir.

394
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,259
Thank you kindly, sir.

395
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,950
Is there anything else
I can tell you, sir?

396
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:24,229
- Nothing at all, I think.
- Al-right sir, good day, sir.

397
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,389
- Good day.
- Good day, gentlemen.

398
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,989
Well, Mr. Holmes,
have we progressed, do you think?

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,699
Perhaps.

400
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,029
Now, tell me, Sir Henry,

401
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,840
when were you planning
to go down to Dartmoor?

402
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,079
Immediately, tomorrow.

403
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,850
I'm really awfully keen
to see the old place.

404
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:44,709
You'll accompany us, Mr. Holmes?

405
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,709
I'd like to very much,
Dr. Mortimer,

406
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,481
but unfortunately I have some rather
pressing business here in London.

407
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,129
Of course, there's no need.

408
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,129
Please don't think me
ungrateful, Dr. Mortimer,

409
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,469
I do appreciate
your concern for me.

410
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,179
But this story of the hound,
it's nonsense.

411
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,679
As for that silly letter
and all the rest of it,

412
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,559
I'm sure it can all quite
easily be explained.

413
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,059
I quite agree with you,
Sir Henry.

414
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,729
All the same, if you don't mind,

415
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,979
I'd like to ask Dr. Watson
to go down with you.

416
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,670
- What's that?
- If you don't mind, Watson.

417
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,859
- Gladly, if you care to come?
- Of course, I'll be delighted.

418
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,859
- Good.
- Oh, thank you, thank you, Dr. Watson.

419
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,239
And thank you, sir.

420
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,489
Then we'll stalk
the hound together.

421
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,069
Don't take it too lightly,
Sir Henry.

422
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,869
- Well, I must be going.
- Mr. Holmes?

423
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,369
Yes, Dr. Mortimer.

424
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,460
About that per7son calling
himself "Sherlock Holmes"?

425
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:25,249
Very interesting, Dr. Mortimer.

426
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,959
- You would, um...
- Keep me posted, Watson, write me daily reports.

427
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,999
- To the smallest detail, Holmes.
- Fine.

428
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,669
I give him into your care,
Sir Henry. Guard him well.

429
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,919
Good night.

430
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,529
Guard me well? I like that.

431
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,809
Here we are, Sir Henry,
on famous Dartmoor,

432
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,729
and what a history it has.

433
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,779
You see those rocks over there.

434
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,859
Actually they're stone houses
built by Neolithic man,

435
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,329
50 or 100,000 years ago.

436
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,369
You don't suppose the
Baskervilles go back that far.

437
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,579
And over there, beyond that
hill, those dark spots.

438
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,089
That's the Great Grimpen Mire,

439
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,339
as treacherous a molass
as exists anywhere.

440
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,639
Thousands of lives have been sucked
down into its bottomless depths.

441
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,259
Cheerful little spot.

442
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,549
But fascinating.

443
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,559
Oh, it is, Sir Henry,
and mysterious.

444
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,769
No wonder the people about here
have such odd beliefs.

445
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,229
Some will tell you

446
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,109
that nothing really ever dies
up on the moor.

447
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,529
And after time
one gets to believe it.

448
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,409
Really?

449
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,739
Do you believe that?

450
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,449
Of course not.

451
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,989
If I believed all the legends
about this place,

452
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,579
I wouldn't live here.

453
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,499
I wouldn't have the courage.

454
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,669
And now, if you look,

455
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,669
Baskerville Hall,

456
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,749
the home of your ancestors,
Sir Henry.

457
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,559
- How are you, Barryman?
- Very well, thank you, sir.

458
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,309
Thank you.

459
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,889
This is Barryman, the butler,
Sir Henry, and Mrs. Barryman.

460
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,059
Welcome, Sir Henry,
welcome to Baskerville Hall.

461
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,399
Thank you.

462
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,729
Barryman was with your
uncle most of his life,

463
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,359
as was his father before him.

464
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,569
Well, I hope you'll be
just as happy here with me.

465
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,659
Thank you, Sir Henry.

466
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,589
Baskerville Hall.

467
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,839
And just as it's always been,
Sir Henry,

468
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,219
your uncle did some
modernizing upstairs,

469
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,389
but down here nothing has been added
or taken away since Sir Hugo's time.

470
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,349
Well, I wouldn't say it's the most
cheerful spot I've ever seen.

471
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,639
I beg your pardon, sir.

472
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,439
What time do you wish
dinner served, sir?

473
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,939
Early I think,
Dr. Mortimer has to drive home.

474
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,359
Tell the coachman to have the
carriage ready after dinner.

475
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,359
I'll tell him, sir. And now,
I suppose you'd like to freshen up.

476
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,029
There's hot water
in your room, sir.

477
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,179
- I'll show the way.
- Thank you.

478
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,369
Be careful, sir, these steps
are a bit in need of repair.

479
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,399
I didn't want to startle you.
I thought you might be asleep.

480
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,989
- What is it?
- Come quickly, someone's prowling around.

481
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,699
What are you doing, Barryman?

482
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,949
Oh, nothing, sir,
it was the window.

483
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,029
The window?

484
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,579
Yes, sir, I was just seeing
that it was fastened.

485
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,550
Well, does it matter
whether it's fastened or not,

486
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:20,369
the window on the second floor?

487
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,209
I go around every night,
seeing that they're fastened.

488
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,549
Sir Charles always
insisted upon it.

489
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,129
Well, that sounds
reasonable enough.

490
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,719
Well, if it's properly fastened now,
Barryman, you can get back to bed.

491
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,389
Yes, sir, thank you.

492
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,319
Do you see anything?

493
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,569
Nothing.

494
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,279
Nothing except
a pinpoint of light

495
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,369
a long way off,
over there by the crags.

496
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,659
Well, keep your eye
on that point of light,

497
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,969
and tell me what happens.

498
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,759
Do you see anything now?

499
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,299
It's gone now.

500
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,469
There it is again,
and there it goes.

501
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,349
Just as I thought.

502
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,229
Barryman was signalling someone.
Come on, get some clothes.

503
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,059
We'll find out.

504
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:40,499
It's still there.

505
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,809
Yes.

506
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,919
Try not to lose sight of it.

507
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,669
Crouch down here,
whoever it is may come back.

508
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,549
What about getting a little
further away from that light?

509
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,669
Up there.

510
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,299
Good idea.

511
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,939
Stop!

512
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,519
Are you mad?

513
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,399
Whoever it is knows his way
among these rocks, we don't.

514
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,989
Who the devil can it be?

515
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,649
You were right about Barryman.

516
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,489
Yes, but what connection
can there possibly be

517
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,989
between that horrible creature
and Barryman?

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,480
You know, I have half a mind to
fire the fellow in the morning,

519
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,369
then notify the police
and let them shadow him.

520
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,959
No, it's the last thing that
Holmes would want us to do.

521
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,629
Our job is to watch Barryman,
watch him like a hawk.

522
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,189
Come on, let's get back.

523
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,539
What, what do you think it is?

524
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,589
What does it sound like to you?

525
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,389
Well, if we were back in London,
this would seem ridiculous.

526
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,219
Let's get on.

527
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,979
Look here, Doctor,

528
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,939
you don't believe that
nonsense, do you?

529
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,399
Of course not,

530
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,859
no more than you do.

531
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,379
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Sir Henry.

532
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,509
So that's our famous moor, huh?

533
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,129
Yes, sir.

534
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,339
Come in.

535
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,109
Where's Sir Henry?

536
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,869
He went out, sir.

537
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,949
Where?

538
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,239
Across the moor.

539
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,449
Didn't I tell you to
let me know immediately

540
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,409
if Sir Henry ever
ventured out there alone?

541
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,419
I know, but I only just
found out from my wife.

542
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,449
Hello there!

543
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,989
Oh, forgive my shouting at you,
Dr. Watson.

544
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,279
My name's Stapleton,
live just across the moor.

545
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,159
But how did you know
my name, sir?

546
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,749
- Oh, from Dr. Mortimer, one of our neighbours.
- Oh, yes, sir.

547
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,869
How is Sir Henry?

548
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,369
He's very well, thank you.

549
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,749
We were a bit worried he might
decide not to come here.

550
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,499
After the rumours that followed
the sad death of Sir Charles,

551
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,169
has Mr. Sherlock Holmes
come to any conclusion yet?

552
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,509
I really can't say.

553
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,240
Well, is he going to honour us
with a visit?

554
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,469
I haven't the slightest idea.

555
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,800
But if I can be of any help,
I do hope you'll call upon me.

556
00:33:50,824 --> 00:33:52,559
I know this place pretty well.

557
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,519
Thank you, but I don't think
I shall be needing any help.

558
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,309
Wonderful place, this moor.

559
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,899
From a scientist point of view,
there's nothing like it.

560
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,939
Vast, barren, mysterious.

561
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,279
You see those
bright green spots over there?

562
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,239
Seems a little more fertile
than the rest.

563
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,029
"Fertile."
That's the Great Grimpen Mire.

564
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,869
One false step means death.

565
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,749
Only yesterday one of the
moor ponies wandered into it.

566
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,959
It turned me sick with horror
to see it struggling.

567
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,859
And the sound of its screams-

568
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,889
What's that?

569
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,299
Oh, that.

570
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,190
Well, the people around here
say it's the hound.

571
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:28,839
Surely you don't
believe such rut.

572
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,639
Bogs make queer noises, or
perhaps it's a bittern booming.

573
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,059
A bittern?

574
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,639
Yes, it's a very rare bird,
practically extinct,

575
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,099
if anything is extinct
on the moor.

576
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,189
Stop, stop!

577
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,069
Look out, stop!

578
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,939
That was a voice.

579
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,929
A woman's voice!

580
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,529
Thank heavens, you heard me!

581
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,449
Another few yards
you'd have been into that mire.

582
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,119
Looks innocent, doesn't it?

583
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,619
But only yesterday
a little moor pony got into it,

584
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,079
and that was the end of it.

585
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,419
Well, thank you
for shouting at me.

586
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,919
- Your Sir Henry?
- Yes.

587
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,049
I suppose I should say welcome,
Sir Henry,

588
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,589
but I'm afraid
it wouldn't be sincere.

589
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,629
Oh, that's understandable.

590
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,839
A stranger coming here and taking the
place of someone you were fond of.

591
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,259
Oh, it's not that, I...

592
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,139
No, Tell me what is it?

593
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,019
Sounds silly, I know, but...

594
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,269
Oh, it's not that
ridiculous hound legend?

595
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,519
I never used to believe those things
till I came to live down here.

596
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,979
But you do now.

597
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,149
You're rich.

598
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,979
You can go anywhere you want to.

599
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,069
There are so many other places
to live in the world,

600
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,489
interesting places.

601
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,519
Just now, I find this place
very interesting.

602
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,159
- Why hello, Beryl.
- Hello.

603
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,690
- Oh, Dr. Watson, my stepsister Miss Stapleton.
- How do you do?

604
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:41,419
How do you do?

605
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,039
Hello, Doctor.

606
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,749
- And this, I'm sure must be...
- Oh, Sir Henry, my brother.

607
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
- How are you?
- I was just telling Dr. Watson

608
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:48,519
how delighted we are
you decided to come here.

609
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,089
I'm here, and to stay.

610
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,139
Oh, that's splendid.

611
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,849
You know, it's been quite dull around
here since the Hall's been closed.

612
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,009
It's wide open now, especially
to friends of my uncle.

613
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,420
You must both come
and dine with me.

614
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,099
You must come to us first.

615
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,519
Yes, what about tomorrow night,
you and Dr. Watson?

616
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,290
We'll invite the neighbours
over to meet you.

617
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:06,069
Of course, you already know
Dr. Mortimer.

618
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,819
The only other one's
old Mr. Frankland.

619
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,899
Who's he?

620
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,230
Wait till you meet him,
Sir Henry.

621
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:12,029
He'll bring suit against you,
I warn you.

622
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,199
- What on earth for?
- He'll find something.

623
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,869
Suing people
is a passion with him.

624
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,369
I'll look forward
to meeting him.

625
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,999
- All right, tomorrow night then.
- Thank you.

626
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,169
And thank you again
for rescuing me.

627
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,099
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

628
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,069
And were it not a personal
insult to Sir Henry.

629
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,920
I would have never have
come here this evening.

630
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,129
Oh, but why, Mr. Frankland?

631
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,869
As a stickler for convention.

632
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,489
I'm not in the habit of
breaking bread with my host

633
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,489
on the eve of prosecuting him.

634
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,659
Great heavens, what crime
have I committed now?

635
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,039
A most gruesome one,
Mr. Stapleton,

636
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,209
that of body snatching.

637
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,839
What?

638
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,009
You're a body snatcher, sir,
a ghoul, a despoiler of graves!

639
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,759
Oh, come, come, Mr. Frankland,

640
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,139
that's a very serious charge.

641
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,159
Oh, Beryl, refill Mr. Frankland's
glass, will you.

642
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,139
Thank you, my dear.

643
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,109
And an excellent
vintage it is too.

644
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,859
- But if you're implying that I'm tipsy, sir!
- Oh, of course he's not.

645
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,399
Tell us more, Mr. Frankland.

646
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,319
Whose body has Mr. Stapleton
been snatching?

647
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,279
According to my evidence, sir,

648
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,829
Mr. Stapleton was seen digging among
the old stone huts in the moor,

649
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,669
and removed from there a skull.

650
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,419
Oh, that!

651
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,339
A most interesting relic,
Sir Henry, of Neolithic man.

652
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,669
I'll show it to you
after dinner.

653
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,759
50,000 years old if it's a day.

654
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:57,339
Nonetheless, sir,
you removed it from the grave

655
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,599
without the consent
of the next of kin,

656
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:04,309
and according to British law,
that constitutes body snatching.

657
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,269
Deny that if you can.

658
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,979
But what good will it do you
to prosecute Mr. Stapleton?

659
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,649
None sir, I have no interest
in the matter.

660
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,399
I act entirely from
a sense of public duty.

661
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,239
If you care to drop by my house someday
and take a tippler of wine with me,

662
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,039
I'll be glad to tell you a thing
or two about everybody here.

663
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,919
About him, prowling the
Grimpen Mire at night,

664
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,209
and why he takes her with him.

665
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,419
Oh, there's no secret about us.

666
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,879
As you know,
I dabble a bit in the occult.

667
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,549
Mrs. Mortimer has very strong
mediumistic qualities.

668
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,559
She finds the old caves
in the moor

669
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,599
particularly conducive
to psychic phenomena.

670
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,439
Very interesting.

671
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,010
Have you ever tried to communicate
with my uncle since his death?

672
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:52,359
Oh yes, on several occasions,

673
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,029
but with no success.

674
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,359
But if my wife would consent
to a seance tonight

675
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,699
while you, Sir Henry,
are present, we might...

676
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,029
No, no, James,
not tonight, please.

677
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,539
Perhaps some other time.

678
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,149
Shall we have coffee
in the drawing room?

679
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,999
If you and Dr. Watson would care
to see my little collection.

680
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
- Oh, yes, the skulls.
- Yes, they're in here.

681
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,653
Yes, I would like to very much.

682
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,889
Quite a museum.

683
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,849
Oh, a very modest
little collection.

684
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,519
But this one really is
quite a treasure.

685
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,899
You'll observe its
unusual cranial index.

686
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,229
Gentleman, gentleman,
my wife has consented!

687
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,399
She's agreed to a seance!

688
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,369
- Splendid.
- Oh, fine.

689
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,829
Please come at once!

690
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,949
Now, then, if you'll all get chairs
and arrange yourselves naturally,

691
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,409
comfortably here by the fire.

692
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,789
As Shakespeare says,

693
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,169
"You can call spirits
from the vastly deep,

694
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,079
but will they answer?"

695
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,039
They won't answer
scoffers are sceptics!

696
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,669
If that's your attitude,
Mr. Frankland,

697
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,339
perhaps you wouldn't
mind leaving us.

698
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,469
I'm sure Mr. Frankland
didn't mean to doubt.

699
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,339
Of course I doubt,

700
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,870
and I ask you to keep a civil
tongue in your head, Dr. Mortimer.

701
00:40:04,894 --> 00:40:07,059
Ordering me out
from under the roof of my host

702
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,639
is grounds for a
very nasty little lawsuit!

703
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,979
Oh, come now, Mr. Frankland,
sit down by me.

704
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,109
Now, tonight we may communicate
with Sir Charles,

705
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,609
find out what he
feared so greatly,

706
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,029
what he was running away from.

707
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,239
Now, Jennifer,
you sit here, please.

708
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,869
Sir Henry, here.

709
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,259
- Would you please put out those lights?
- Certainly.

710
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,539
Stapleton, that light please.

711
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,579
Dr. Watson.

712
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,009
Now, would you all keep quiet,

713
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,429
and sit quite naturally.

714
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,709
Sir Henry, your hand, please?

715
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,989
Sir Charles,
can you speak to us?

716
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,699
Let us know if you're present.

717
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,949
There are things
that only you can explain.

718
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,449
Speak to us, Sir Charles,
if you're here.

719
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:17,459
There are things that
only you can tell us.

720
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,169
Sir Charles,
can you speak to us?

721
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,799
Let us know if you're present.

722
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,179
There are things
that only you can tell us.

723
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,349
Speak to us, Sir Charles,
if you're here.

724
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,479
There are things
that only you can explain.

725
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,729
That sound.
I've heard it before.

726
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:44,109
It's nothing,
nothing but the wind.

727
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,449
Or a bittern.

728
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,789
I was telling Dr. Watson
only yesterday about it.

729
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,569
Sir Charles,

730
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,129
what happened that night?

731
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,469
What was it you feared?

732
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,719
Tell us, Sir Charles, of all
the weird, terrible things

733
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,069
that have happened on the moor?

734
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,139
Listen. There it is again.

735
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:18,649
Oh, I can't stand it. Would
somebody put on the lights, please?

736
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,979
I tell you it's nothing,
nothing but the wind.

737
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,699
Mr. Frankland,
what did you think it was?

738
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,789
The hound, of course,
the hound of the Baskervilles.

739
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,909
Any fool would know that!

740
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,999
James, get my cape,
take me home.

741
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:44,509
Very well, my dear.

742
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,089
Dr. Watson, can I give you
and Sir Henry a lift?

743
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,429
No, thank you,
we have our own carriage.

744
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,599
You're trembling.

745
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,969
That wasn't the wind we heard.

746
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,349
I've heard that sound
before, often.

747
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,639
That's what I tried to tell you
yesterday on the moor.

748
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,170
That's why I wish
you hadn't come here.

749
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:01,979
But sounds can't hurt you.

750
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,229
It doesn't matter what they are
or where they come from.

751
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,069
You don't know.

752
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,949
Oh, you've got to get all that
nonsense out of your head, Beryl.

753
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,909
- I wish I could.
- You're going to.

754
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,319
I'm going to make it my
business to see that you do.

755
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,119
You've been alone too much.

756
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,659
There's nothing to do down here.
That's the trouble.

757
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,659
I'm going to change all that,
if you let me.

758
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,169
We'll go fishing together, riding.

759
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,879
Do you like riding?

760
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,089
Yes, I do.

761
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,339
Good, we'll start tomorrow,
shall we?

762
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,669
Yes, thanks.

763
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,179
Fine, I'll ride over for you
in the morning.

764
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,049
- Are you coming, Sir Henry?
- Right, Doctor.

765
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,499
- Good night.
- Good night.

766
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:00,669
Hello.

767
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,789
Hello, Beryl.

768
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,459
Well, where shall we go today?

769
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,419
- There's one place we haven't been, High Tor.
- Fine.

770
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,089
That's where all
the old ruins are.

771
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,589
You know, Jack says that
they're over 50,000 years old.

772
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,129
That sounds interesting.

773
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,260
And you can still see the
remains of their stone huts.

774
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,003
All right, good.

775
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,189
Those platter stones over there,
they're graves.

776
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,569
Oh, and those huge ones, monoliths,
the remains of their temples.

777
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,399
Doesn't anybody know who they
were or what they looked like?

778
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,279
Jack has a theory about them.

779
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,159
But anyway, they must have
been very primitive

780
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,949
living on roots
and dressing in skins.

781
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,039
But still laughing and
dreaming, just as we do.

782
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,079
I wonder how many times
some young savage

783
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,959
brought his bride
into this very hut.

784
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,589
Said, take your hat off,
darling, this is home!

785
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,339
You know, this is probably where
she cooked his first meal for him.

786
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,059
And what a yell he must have
let out when she burnt it up.

787
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,269
And now they're quite forgotten.

788
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,269
Just as we will be too, one day.

789
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,069
Do you suppose when a man
met a girl that he liked,

790
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,029
he had to wait
a respectably long time

791
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,649
before he dared tell her,

792
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,369
or things like that,
sudden, natural?

793
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,829
I'd like to think that
things were like that.

794
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,079
Beryl, that's the way
they are with me.

795
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:26,459
Oh, oh, but we've only known each
other for such a little while.

796
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,709
There, you see,
convention, custom!

797
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,799
We can't even be ourselves
when we want to be.

798
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,169
Why is that?

799
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,469
You know, I used to come
down here quite often

800
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,639
and explore these old caves when
Jack and I first came to live here.

801
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,099
I didn't have a fear
of the moor then.

802
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,929
And you've none now
that's all gone.

803
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,639
When I'm with you, it's gone.

804
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,859
I seem to forget it,
laughing and talking.

805
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,609
When I'm alone
it all comes back to me.

806
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,689
And at night
I still wake up trembling,

807
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,739
as if in my sleep
I can hear those awful noises.

808
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,739
Then it gets bad as ever, and

809
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,550
- oh, I think of you and I wish you weren't here.
- Oh, don't say that.

810
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:02,369
Well, I wish you were in London
or in Canada.

811
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,209
But even if I wanted to go back
to London or Canada, I couldn't.

812
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,749
Why not?

813
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,589
You know why. You must know why.

814
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,079
I can't go anywhere now,
unless you come with me.

815
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,769
Oh, Henry.

816
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,939
Oh.

817
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:34,069
Would you mind
pausing for a minute?

818
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,609
I'm afraid I've lost my way.

819
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,989
Hello, Doctor.

820
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,779
Sir Henry and I were just...

821
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,819
We were... We were...

822
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,659
- We were getting engaged.
- Engaged! Splendid.

823
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,209
- May I congratulate you both?
- Thank you.

824
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,139
Thank you.

825
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,249
Who is that?

826
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,220
It seems that we didn't pick
a very secluded spot.

827
00:46:55,244 --> 00:46:56,509
What do you want?

828
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,259
Just crossing the moor, sir.

829
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,009
Just crossing the moor.

830
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,639
I... I be peddling my wares, sir.

831
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,889
I must have something here
what interests you, sir.

832
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,499
How about... how about
a nice mouth organ, sir?

833
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,779
No, thank you.

834
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,779
Here, here's something an old
squire like you could use, sir,

835
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,279
a fusel,

836
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,539
a fusel for calling
your sheep dog.

837
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,449
- Calling my what?
- Sheep dog, sir.

838
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,649
A regular charmer, sir.

839
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,209
Hear it for miles around, sir.

840
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,759
Take it away,
and yourself with it!

841
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,259
How, how about, how about
some scent for the lady, sir?

842
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,790
That'll do.
Be off about your business.

843
00:47:44,814 --> 00:47:48,309
All right, all right, sir,
I ain't doing no harm.

844
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,269
I ain't doing no harm.

845
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,359
You know, that's what
I hate about this moor.

846
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:56,529
There's always
something strange.

847
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,289
Look, he's limping
on the other foot now.

848
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,379
Barryman?

849
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,549
Yes, sir.

850
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,009
Who delivered this note?

851
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,669
No one, sir. I found it
slipped under the front door.

852
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,279
Thank you.

853
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,289
Oh, Barryman,
is Sir Henry at home?

854
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,329
No, sir.
He's gone across the moor.

855
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,879
Hmm, sorry I missed him.

856
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,169
Did Dr. Watson go with him?

857
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,249
No, sir.

858
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,799
Oh, thank you, Barryman.

859
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,929
- I'll tell Sir Henry you called, sir.
- Yes, do.

860
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,759
Was it you who sent
me that communication?

861
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,179
I did, sir!

862
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,349
Out with it, whatever it is
you want me to hear!

863
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,309
I only want you to hear
this zither, sir.

864
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,309
Zither?

865
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,109
They don't come no finer, sir.

866
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,859
What blasted impertinence!

867
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,399
Getting me out here to see...

868
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,659
Look here my man,

869
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,779
you're up to something!

870
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,909
I... I only ask you to try 'em, sir!

871
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,079
Be careful, the things loaded!

872
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:37,619
Who are you?

873
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,329
Well, I might ask
the same of you, sir,

874
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,249
travelling around the moor,
spying out on everybody.

875
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,089
That's my business, to spy.

876
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,129
Oh, oh, it is, is it?

877
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,509
Yes, and if you want to know
who I am, I'll tell you.

878
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,389
Who... who are ye?

879
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,849
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

880
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,439
Sherlock Holmes, the detective?

881
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,649
Yes, and now perhaps you realize
why I can't be hoodwinked.

882
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,229
Oh, sir, sir, sir,
that changes everything.

883
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,279
Now, who are you? Quick!

884
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,199
Well, in that case, sir,

885
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,369
my name must be Watson.
Ha, ha, ha.

886
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,619
- Holmes!
- How are you, my dear fellow?

887
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,909
A fine detective you are,
calling yourself Sherlock Holmes!

888
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,419
So you've been down here
on the moor all the time!

889
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,459
That's a fine way
to treat me, I must say!

890
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,339
Send me down here, let me think
you were in London,

891
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,759
working on that Blackman case,
make me sit up half the night

892
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:32,589
writing those blasted reports!

893
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,200
Superior reports my dear Watson,
and very valuable they were, too.

894
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:37,429
I made arrangements to have
them forwarded on to me.

895
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,349
A shabby trick
which I'll not forget.

896
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,309
Ah, but a very necessary trick.

897
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,229
If I'd come down here
with you and Sir Henry,

898
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,189
every movement of mine
would have been watched.

899
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,019
Why, in this way, only you and
Sir Henry have been watched,

900
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:50,439
and I've been free to work.

901
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,069
That's all very well,
but making a fool of me.

902
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,239
Sit down, Watson, do sit down.

903
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,610
Perhaps a little supper will
help you to get over your huff.

904
00:52:57,634 --> 00:52:58,949
Huff, I'm in no huff!

905
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,619
Here,
try some of these sardines.

906
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,270
It's a pity
I didn't know you were coming,

907
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:03,959
I'd have provided a
braise of pheasant.

908
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,379
It's a pity you didn't think of
bringing that inferno violin of yours,

909
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:09,379
to regale me with some
of your enchanting music.

910
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,839
I did, my dear Watson.

911
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,299
Anything to oblige.

912
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:22,639
Well, if you've had enough to eat, Watson,
and you're feeling in better spirits,

913
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,099
I think we better
be getting along.

914
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,899
Getting along where,
if I'm not prying?

915
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,729
I'm returning with you
to Baskerville Hall.

916
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,380
There are still some gaps
to be filled in,

917
00:53:31,404 --> 00:53:33,489
but all in all, things are
becoming a little clearer.

918
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,449
Not to me, I assure you.
It's still a hopeless jumble.

919
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,699
Mr. Frankland, Dr. Mortimer,
the Barrymans,

920
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,499
put it all together
and what have you got?

921
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,539
Murder, my dear Watson,

922
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,579
refined, cold-blooded murder.

923
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,339
Murder?

924
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,629
There's no doubt about it
in my mind.

925
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,049
Or, perhaps I should say
in my imagination.

926
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,839
But that's where crimes are
conceived and where they're solved,

927
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,349
in the imagination.

928
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,689
But there's been no murder,
unless you mean Sir Charles.

929
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,109
And the facts clearly indicated
that he died from heart failure.

930
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,689
That's why so many
murders remain unsolved.

931
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,779
People will stick to facts
even though they prove nothing.

932
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,859
Now, if we go beyond facts,

933
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:19,819
use our imagination
as to criminal does,

934
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,409
imagine what might have
happened and act upon it,

935
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,039
as I've been trying to do
in this case,

936
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,159
we usually find
ourselves justified.

937
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,209
- Then you know?
- Another day or two at the most, and I will know.

938
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,089
My one fear is that the murder
will strike before we're ready.

939
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,419
In that case...

940
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,879
What's that?

941
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,179
Where's it coming from?

942
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,789
- There.
- No, no, no there!

943
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:47,729
The hound.

944
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,929
Come on Watson, quick!

945
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:12,669
Look!

946
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,759
Sir Henry!

947
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,889
He must have run along that
bridge and fallen over the cliff.

948
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,019
He's dead.

949
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,099
His skull is crushed in.

950
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:30,729
The convict! Thank heaven!

951
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,149
What?

952
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,399
That's the man I shot at
the night we arrived,

953
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,609
the man Barryman
was signalling to.

954
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,489
Who is it?

955
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,899
The Notting Hill murderer.

956
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,949
He escaped from prison
last month

957
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,529
and hiding on the
moor ever since.

958
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,539
The Notting Hill murderer?

959
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,289
Do you mean that he's
responsible for all this?

960
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,039
That remains to be seen.

961
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,999
But he's wearing
Sir Henry's clothes.

962
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,919
Yes, yes, that accounts for it.

963
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,669
- Accounts for what?
- For the hound.

964
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,259
These clothes were the cause
of that poor devil's death.

965
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,379
Do you mean that the hound
was after Sir Henry?

966
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:04,929
Yes, and mistook the convict for him
because of the scent of the clothes.

967
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,019
Do you remember that
missing boot, Watson?

968
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,019
Why do you suppose
the brown one,

969
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,729
the one that had
never been worn,

970
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,689
was so mysteriously replaced
and the black one taken?

971
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,689
- Why?
- Because a boot that had never been worn

972
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,649
wouldn't have had the scent of
the owner, and the black one had.

973
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,279
But how does this convict come to
be wearing Sir Henry's clothes?

974
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,319
Oh, well, that's simple enough.

975
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,659
Why, Dr. Watson!

976
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,119
Is somebody hurt? Who's this?

977
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,039
The convict who
escaped from Princeton.

978
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,539
Oh, how terrible.

979
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,539
I heard a cry, that's what
brought me over here.

980
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,459
What's your theory about it,
Mr. Holmes?

981
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,959
You're quick at identification.

982
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,839
Oh, everybody knows you, sir.

983
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:43,050
As a matter of fact, we've
been expecting you down here.

984
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:45,099
- My name's Stapleton.
- How do you do?

985
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,679
You came in time
to see a tragedy.

986
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,969
Yes, it's a most unpleasant
remembrance for me

987
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,929
to take back to London tomorrow.

988
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,309
But must you go so soon?

989
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,920
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

990
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,559
Yes, yes, I'm afraid I must.

991
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,331
We've been hoping, Mr. Holmes, that
you may be able to shed some light

992
00:56:58,355 --> 00:57:01,989
on the occurrences that
have puzzled us down here.

993
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,529
Yes, but an investigator needs something
more than legends and rumours.

994
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,699
Oh, quite so.

995
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,619
Give me a hand, will you,
Watson.

996
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,249
We better put this poor fellow in
one of the huts till the morning.

997
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,659
Let me give you a hand.

998
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,669
Oh, I think we can manage
all right, thank you.

999
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:24,179
Where's Sir Henry, Barryman?

1000
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,339
In the library, sir.

1001
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,679
Oh, Barryman,
if your wife's still up,

1002
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,389
will you tell her Mr. Sherlock
Holmes would like a word with her?

1003
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,059
- Sherlock Holmes?
- Yes.

1004
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,099
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1005
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,819
Sir Henry.

1006
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,109
Holmes.

1007
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,800
Oh, I'm glad to see you
so well, Sir Henry.

1008
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:48,760
- Why didn't you tell me Mr. Holmes was coming?
- Well, I'm...

1009
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:51,199
Oh, he didn't know. We ran across
each other in the village.

1010
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,409
I am glad to see you.
What is it, Barryman?

1011
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,169
Oh, I asked to see Mrs. Barryman,
if you don't mind, Sir Henry?

1012
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,959
Of course not.

1013
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,209
Come in, Mrs. Barryman.

1014
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,719
I think you better sit down.

1015
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,339
Thank you, sir,
I prefer to stand.

1016
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,099
I'm afraid I have some
rather bad news for you.

1017
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,849
What is it?

1018
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,889
Well, it's going to be
a bit of a shock.

1019
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,439
Oh, they've caught him.

1020
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:25,859
Your, your brother...

1021
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:29,029
They'll hang him for sure.

1022
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,289
No, Mrs. Barryman,
he's beyond the law now.

1023
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,949
He's in more merciful hands.

1024
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,209
We came across the poor fellow
as we were crossing the moor.

1025
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,469
He must have missed his footing
and fallen over the cliff.

1026
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,759
No further need, Barryman, to
signal to him from the window

1027
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,099
or take food out to him or

1028
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:55,429
give him Sir Henry's
discarded clothes.

1029
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,559
I'm sorry, Sir Henry.
It is all my doing?

1030
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,609
Barryman here
wanted to tell you all along

1031
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,899
so as you could notify
the police.

1032
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:07,569
It was he was my kin,
my own kin,

1033
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,819
even though he wasn't
never any good.

1034
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,829
We understand.

1035
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,869
You won't hold it against
Barryman will you, sir?

1036
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,619
Of course not.

1037
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,129
Now, take her along,
see that she's all right.

1038
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,539
Thank you, sir.

1039
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,689
Thank you, Sir Henry.

1040
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,719
Well, it's nice to get that end
cleared up,

1041
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,179
for their sake as well as mine.

1042
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,389
It clears up everything,
I think, Sir Henry.

1043
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,729
That poor devil must have been
completely demented.

1044
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,420
And that accounts for those
dreadful noises

1045
00:59:40,444 --> 00:59:42,649
- that we've been hearing from time to time.
- Exactly.

1046
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,819
Your troubles are over,
Sir Henry.

1047
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,729
I really am most grateful,
Mr. Holmes.

1048
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,609
Oh, not at all,
I've done little enough.

1049
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,659
But you can sleep peacefully
in your bed now

1050
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,369
and commence to lead the life
of a happy country squire.

1051
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,739
Well, not for a little bit,
I'm afraid.

1052
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,749
- I'm off to Canada again.
- Canada?

1053
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,249
Beryl, Miss Stapleton and I,
are going to be married.

1054
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,539
Miss Stapleton?

1055
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,999
A very charming young lady.
Congratulations.

1056
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,589
Everything's arranged.

1057
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,669
Her brother's giving us a
farewell party tomorrow night.

1058
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,440
We'll be married in London
the following day,

1059
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:12,069
and then off for a honeymoon
to Canada.

1060
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,469
- My congratulations, too, Sir Henry.
- Thanks.

1061
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,929
What luck you're here.

1062
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,900
You and Dr. Watson
will be with us tomorrow night!

1063
01:00:17,924 --> 01:00:19,639
No, I'm sorry, I...
I'm afraid I can't.

1064
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,899
I must hurry back to London,
and so should you too, Watson.

1065
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,359
We'll have to report to the police here
about that convict in the morning,

1066
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:27,370
but there's a train leaving
early in the afternoon.

1067
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:29,779
Oh, what a pity! Beryl will be
dreadfully disappointed.

1068
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:31,750
Now, we'll remedy that
when you come up to London.

1069
01:00:31,774 --> 01:00:34,449
You must...

1070
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,159
You must dine with us
before you sail.

1071
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:47,919
Well, there's the old boy
himself, Sir Hugo.

1072
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,799
Hugo,
the Beast of the Baskervilles.

1073
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:53,339
Not a bad bit of brushwork, by
Ransom, one of the minor painters.

1074
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:54,969
Oh, I don't imagine
it's very valuable.

1075
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,929
I can't quite agree with you,
Sir Henry.

1076
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,139
One day it might prove
to be of the greatest value.

1077
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,239
Well, we must be going.

1078
01:01:12,329 --> 01:01:14,169
There's still one or two
little points, Holmes,

1079
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:16,619
and I can't for the life of me
reconcile with your theory,

1080
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,369
about that poor demented convict.
One or two little points?

1081
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,289
Surely you can't mean that he
was in London three weeks ago,

1082
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,209
sent that letter,
stole that boot?

1083
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,289
- Of course not.
- Then who the devil did?

1084
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,709
The same person that was responsible for
the death of that convict last night

1085
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,089
- and will try again to murder Sir Henry tonight.
- Tonight?

1086
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,180
Unless my imagination has run away with
itself, and I don't think that it has.

1087
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:37,719
Then why are we
rushing up to London,

1088
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,309
leaving Sir Henry
entirely unprotected?

1089
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,059
We're not, my dear Watson,

1090
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:44,059
we're just giving the impression
of rushing up to London.

1091
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:45,399
In a minute and a half
we'll be in Oak Hampton,

1092
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,130
there we'll catch a train
back to Dartmouth,

1093
01:01:47,131 --> 01:01:49,451
and if my surmise is correct,
we'll nab our man in the act.

1094
01:01:49,475 --> 01:01:51,939
But if you know who it is, why
all this roundabout rigmarole?

1095
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,310
- Why don't you have him arrested?
- Because I have no case,

1096
01:01:54,334 --> 01:01:56,859
not a shred of evidence
that would hold in any court.

1097
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,779
The only way is to
catch him red-handed,

1098
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:03,199
to catch him in such a way that
there's no escape, no alibi.

1099
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,850
- And that means gambling with Sir Henry's life.
- But you can't...

1100
01:02:05,874 --> 01:02:07,919
Gambling to save his life.

1101
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,169
But we've got to take
that chance.

1102
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:14,339
Otherwise, the shadow of sudden death
will be forever hanging over his head

1103
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:16,339
and sooner or later...

1104
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,979
Here we are, Oak Hampton.

1105
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:22,639
And may you both spend the
rest of your years together

1106
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,889
- in happy contentment.
- Here, here.

1107
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,019
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1108
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:30,150
And now, I want to thank you all for the
kindness that you've shown a stranger.

1109
01:02:30,174 --> 01:02:32,359
And when Beryl and I return,

1110
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,090
I want you to know that you'll always
be welcome at Baskerville Hall.

1111
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:36,899
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Sir Henry.

1112
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,409
It's going to be lonely for you,
Mr. Stapleton, with Beryl gone.

1113
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,659
Yes, indeed it will,
Mrs. Mortimer.

1114
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,079
I shall be more dependent than
ever upon you, my neighbours.

1115
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:47,579
Don't count upon me, sir.

1116
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,669
In my opinion
you're a body snatcher.

1117
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,299
And until the courts
have decreed otherwise,

1118
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,549
I want nothing whatsoever
to do with you!

1119
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,639
Oh, Mr. Frankland.

1120
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,679
I say, driver,
can't you go a little faster?

1121
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,829
I'm doing the best I can, sir.

1122
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,609
You idiot!

1123
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,089
We said go faster,
not break our necks.

1124
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,319
How fast is it
to Baskerville Hall?

1125
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,949
It's five miles by road, sir,

1126
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,829
but if you want to
cut over the moor,

1127
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,329
- it's only about three.
- Here you are.

1128
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,009
- Come on Watson, quick!
- Thank you, sir.

1129
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,289
It's been a wonderful evening,
Stapleton.

1130
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,819
- Oh, glad you could be with us, Mortimer.
- Thank you.

1131
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:39,219
Take this brooch, my dear, and
wear it on your wedding dress.

1132
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,639
It belonged to my
great grandmother.

1133
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:44,349
Something old, something new.

1134
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,639
You know.

1135
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,349
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
Mrs. Mortimer.

1136
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,679
Thank you so much.

1137
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,349
And come back to us soon,
both of you.

1138
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,609
We will.

1139
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,609
May I offer you a lift, my lad?

1140
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,500
It's such a beautiful night, Mr. Frankland,
I think I'll walk, thank you.

1141
01:03:58,524 --> 01:04:01,659
Merely a gesture of hospitality.
Reject it if you like.

1142
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,019
Get up, there!

1143
01:04:05,459 --> 01:04:07,499
You're not going to cross
the moor alone, Sir Henry?

1144
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,669
Why not? There's nothing
to fear any more?

1145
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,209
We can't be sure.

1146
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,260
Oh, but I have Mr. Sherlock Holmes'
own word for it.

1147
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,583
Come along, James.

1148
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:21,089
- Good night, Sir Henry.
- Good night, Mrs. Mortimer.

1149
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,439
- And the best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

1150
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,299
- Good night.
- Good night.

1151
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:37,439
I wish you'd let Mr. Frankland
drive you home.

1152
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,949
I wanted to stay
and say goodnight to you.

1153
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,989
This is our last goodnight.

1154
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,779
From tomorrow on
there won't be any more, ever.

1155
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,869
Tomorrow we'll be away
from this place.

1156
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,289
I wish it were now.

1157
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,959
So do I.

1158
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,409
Oh now, don't be silly.

1159
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,349
- Good night, Beryl.
- Good night, dear.

1160
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,519
Well, was it a nice party?

1161
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:21,529
Wonderful, everything,
and most of all you.

1162
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,159
Jack, I hadn't said very much
about going away,

1163
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,739
- but you know how I feel.
- Yes, of course, it had to be.

1164
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,869
You won't be too
dreadfully lonely, will you?

1165
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,329
No, I shall have my work...

1166
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,260
Henry and I will be back
before you even know it.

1167
01:05:33,284 --> 01:05:34,709
Yes, of course you will.

1168
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,169
Well, you better go to bed now.

1169
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:38,629
You've got a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

1170
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,109
- Good night, Jack.
- Good night, dear.

1171
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,429
Over there!

1172
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,209
We'll head him off!

1173
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,519
Jack!

1174
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,109
Where are you?

1175
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:46,939
He's coming to.

1176
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:50,269
You'll be all right, old man.

1177
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,939
- Watson.
- Yes, old chap.

1178
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:59,449
- Mr. Holmes?
- Yes.

1179
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,949
What, what, what was it?

1180
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,699
We've got to get him home,
quickly!

1181
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:07,039
- Can you manage him alone?
- Yes.

1182
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:09,669
Because I've got things to do.

1183
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,179
Help get his arm
around my shoulder.

1184
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,619
I'm all right.

1185
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,659
It's pretty painful, I know,
but it won't take much longer.

1186
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,959
Go on, it doesn't hurt.

1187
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:57,579
Now, Mrs. Barryman,
some gauze, please.

1188
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:59,379
I just heard the dreadful news.

1189
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:00,959
Thank heavens, you're safe.

1190
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,709
Is he all right?

1191
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,629
Well, now we know for certain
that this is no legend, no myth.

1192
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:06,889
There really is a hound.

1193
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,599
- Was a hound.
- Yes, Mr. Holmes told me.

1194
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,679
I ran into him across the moor.

1195
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,769
He asked me to
send you to him at once.

1196
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,769
It's a matter of
great importance.

1197
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,620
He said he'd wait for you at the spot
where the... the beast was killed.

1198
01:14:18,644 --> 01:14:20,189
I must finish here first.

1199
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,939
This poor boy
has taken a terrific beating.

1200
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,449
Well, I could carry on
for you, Doctor.

1201
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,199
I'm a bit of a doctor myself,
you know.

1202
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,569
Do you think you could manage?

1203
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,279
Yes, I'm sure I could.

1204
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:32,369
I think you really ought to go,
Dr. Watson.

1205
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,039
Mr. Holmes was most urgent.

1206
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:35,719
Oh, really?

1207
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,919
I shall need some hot water,
Mrs. Barryman.

1208
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,729
- Oh, I want it boiling, please.
- Yes, sir.

1209
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:54,889
It must have been a terrifying
experience, Sir Henry, terrifying.

1210
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:57,309
It was, it was indeed.

1211
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,269
Yes, I can see you're still
weak from loss of blood.

1212
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,149
I can't say I feel any too well.

1213
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,569
Here, drink this, Sir Henry,
you'll feel much stronger.

1214
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:09,079
I'll see to your other
bandages after.

1215
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:19,779
Oh, it may taste a little
bitter, but don't mind that.

1216
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,739
Sir Henry!

1217
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,719
Well, feeling better?

1218
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:30,299
Yes, thanks.

1219
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,510
I say, that's uncomfortably
close to your eye, isn't it?

1220
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:34,059
Along this side?

1221
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:37,349
Well, well, well.

1222
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,559
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
that was clumsy of me.

1223
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,059
It was only a bit of a tonic.

1224
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,149
- Sir Henry's lost considerable blood.
- Yes?

1225
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:45,819
Henry?

1226
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,189
Henry.

1227
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,069
- I'm all right, darling.
- Oh, no you're not.

1228
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,279
We heard those dreadful noises
on the way home.

1229
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,079
It's a mercy he's alive.

1230
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,659
I owe you an apology, Sir Henry,
for jeopardizing your life.

1231
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:58,409
Jeopardizing?
But you saved my life.

1232
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,329
But there was no possible way
for me to foretell the final.

1233
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:03,749
And I must apologize too,
for deceiving you last night.

1234
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,520
When I told you that
your troubles were over,

1235
01:16:05,544 --> 01:16:06,919
I knew that they weren't.

1236
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,719
But if I hadn't cleared out,
the crisis, which came tonight,

1237
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,219
would have been
indefinitely postponed

1238
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:12,639
with a shadow of death
hanging over you.

1239
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:16,559
And over you too,
Miss Stapleton.

1240
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,479
You knew this was
going to happen?

1241
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,149
How could you know?

1242
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,019
The person who wanted to snuff
out your life, Sir Henry,

1243
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:28,149
was the same one
who plotted to kill your uncle.

1244
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,279
He wanted to get you
both out of the way

1245
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:33,779
so that he could lay claim to this
place, to the whole Baskerville estate.

1246
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,949
In tracing back his lineage,

1247
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,289
he discovered not only
that he was the next of kin,

1248
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,999
but also learned that
old legend about the hound.

1249
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:43,209
So he brought the hound to life

1250
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:46,129
by the simple expedient of buying
the most savage dog he could find

1251
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,589
and hiding it here on the moor
until he needed it.

1252
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,549
If he had succeeded tonight,

1253
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,469
the blame would have fallen
on the legendary monster,

1254
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,059
and no possible suspicion would
have been attached to him.

1255
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,639
A most ingenious device.

1256
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,889
And I'm quite sure that he
would have had no difficulty

1257
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:07,729
in proving his claim to Baskerville
Hall and all that goes with it.

1258
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:12,229
A most amazing instance of a
throwback that I've ever seen.

1259
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,539
- And you can see for yourself...
- Stapleton!

1260
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,159
One move and I'll shoot!

1261
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,669
- Jack!
- You two, stay where you are!

1262
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,579
You're under arrest, Stapleton,

1263
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:27,339
for the murder of Sir Charles
Baskerville, the murder of a convict

1264
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,919
and the attempted murder
of Sir Henry!

1265
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:31,299
You can't arrest me, Holmes!

1266
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:35,739
Now, one move from any of you and
I'll blast you all to kingdom come!

1267
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,559
So sorry, old boy!

1268
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,319
What's the matter, old man?

1269
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,609
What's the matter?
That's our man.

1270
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,569
Stapleton, a murderer?

1271
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,239
He won't get very far.

1272
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:58,619
I posted constables on both the
roads, and the only other way

1273
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:01,389
is across the Grimpen Mire.

1274
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,669
I'm so sorry, Miss Stapleton,

1275
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,079
I wish I could have
spared you this.

1276
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:21,559
Well, that officially closes
the case, Sir Henry,

1277
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:23,610
and a very interesting case
for your annals, Watson.

1278
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:25,439
An ordinary dog
and an ingenious criminal.

1279
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:27,559
And a more ingenious detective.

1280
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:29,649
I owe you a tremendous debt
of gratitude.

1281
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,529
We all do, Sir Henry.

1282
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:37,909
Mr. Holmes, we've admired you in
the past, as does every Englishman.

1283
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,829
Your record as our greatest detective
is known throughout the world,

1284
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,369
but this, seeing how you work,

1285
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,869
knowing that there is in
England such a man as you,

1286
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:49,539
it gives us all a sense
of safety and security.

1287
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,919
God bless you, Mr. Holmes.

1288
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:54,669
Thank you, Dr. Mortimer,
thank you.

1289
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,040
And now, if you don't mind, I've
had rather a strenuous day.

1290
01:18:57,064 --> 01:18:59,849
- I think I'll turn in.
- Of course.

1291
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,809
- Good night.
- Good night.

1292
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,729
- Good night, Mr. Holmes.
- Good night.

1293
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,019
Oh, Watson, the needle.
