1
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,177
Yeah, D.B.? Cleaning out deadwood.

2
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,777
Okay.

3
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,358
Mr. Connell I can't afford
to be without work right now.

4
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,751
Not even for a day.

5
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,808
I've got a mother
and two kid sisters.

6
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:36,534
More 'good luck' telegrams.

7
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:38,773
You know how it is.

8
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,986
I've got to keep on working, see?

9
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,306
Sorry, sister. I was sent
down here to clean house.

10
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:45,874
I told you I can't use
your column anymore.

11
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,083
It's lavender and old lace.

12
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:48,402
Send those other people in.

13
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:49,647
I'll tell you what I'll do.

14
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:53,663
I get 30 dollars a week.
I'll take 25, 20 if necessary.

15
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,271
- I'll do anything you say.
- It isn't the money.

16
00:02:56,437 --> 00:03:00,078
We're after circulation, fireworks.
People that hit with sledgehammers,

17
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,402
start arguments.

18
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:03,056
I can do that.
I know this town inside out.

19
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:05,694
- Give me a chance, please.
- Alright, come in.

20
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:08,072
Cashier's got your check.

21
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,636
Who are these people?

22
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,116
Gibbs, Crawley,
Cunningham, Giles.

23
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:13,879
Hey you, sister!

24
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,858
Don't forget your last column
before you pick up your check.

25
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,800
You're a couple of sticks shy
on your column, ma'am.

26
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,652
Big rich slob like D.B. Norton buys
a paper and chops 40 heads off.

27
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:44,544
- Did you get it too?
- You too?

28
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,996
Joe, I'm sorry darling.

29
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,318
Let's we tear the building down.

30
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,089
Before you do, you better
finish this column.

31
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:56,378
Lavender and old lace.

32
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,944
Wait, Joe. Wait.

33
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,729
Wants fireworks, huh?

34
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,057
Okay.

35
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,304
Here.

36
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,126
"Below is a letter which
reached my desk this morning.

37
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,494
It's a commentary on what we
laughingly call a 'civilized world'.

38
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:37,457
Dear Miss Mitchell, 4 years ago
I was fired out of my job.

39
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,626
Since then I haven't had another.

40
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:42,365
At first I was sore at
the State Administration because

41
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:46,450
it's on account of slimy politics
we have all this unemployment.

42
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,547
But in looking around, it seems
the whole world's going to pot.

43
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,681
In protest, I'm committing suicide
by jumping of the City Hall roof.

44
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:57,843
Signed, a disgusted
American citizen: John Doe."

45
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,934
Editor's note:
"If you ask this column,

46
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,989
the wrong people
are jumping of the roofs."

47
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:07,121
Ann, this is the
old fake-a-roo, isn't it?

48
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,242
Never mind that, go ahead.

49
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:33,200
"... because of slimy politics

50
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,643
that we have
all this unemployment."

51
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,251
There it is. D.B Norton's
opening attack on the Governor.

52
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,657
Why Jim, it's just a letter
sent into a column.

53
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,825
No, I can smell it. That's Norton.

54
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:47,116
Good morning, gentleman.
You're here rather early.

55
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:49,851
Governor, did you happen to see
the new Bulletin?

56
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,455
Yes, I had it served with breakfast.

57
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,191
- Jim thinks it's D.B. Norton.
- Of course it is.

58
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:57,755
Come, Jim. That little item?

59
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,884
D.B. Norton does things
in a much bigger way.

60
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:04,414
It's his opening attack on you,
Governor. Take my word for it.

61
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:06,460
What did he buy a paper for?

62
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:08,940
Why did he engage a
high pressure editor like Connell?

63
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:12,478
He's in the oil business.
Governor, he's after your scalp.

64
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:15,928
Alright, Jim.
Don't burst a blood vessel.

65
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,455
- I'll look into it.
- Yes, sir?

66
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:21,301
Get me Spencer
of the Daily Chronicle, please.

67
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,316
Yes, I saw it, Governor.
If you ask me, it's a phony letter.

68
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,479
That gag's got whiskers on it.

69
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,698
I'll get the Mayor and Chamber
of Commerce to go after them.

70
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,901
Get Mayor Lovett on the phone.

71
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,385
Sorry, the Mayor's busy
on the other phone.

72
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:39,557
Yes, I know, Mrs. Brewster, it's
a terrible reflection on our city.

73
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,852
- I've had a dozen calls already.
- Spencer at the Chronicle.

74
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:43,930
Just a minute.

75
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,776
Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.

76
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:49,836
I insist that this John Doe
be found a job at once.

77
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,681
If something isn't done,
I'll call out the whole Auxiliary.

78
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,369
And the Junior Auxiliary.
We'll hold a meeting

79
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:57,018
and see that it is...

80
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:59,063
Yes, Spency? Who?

81
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,184
The Governor?

82
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,151
It's my building he jumping off!
And I'm up for re-election.

83
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,478
What? Get Connell at the Bulletin.

84
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,886
Why, he's liable to go
right past my win...

85
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:10,780
- What was that?
- What?

86
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:13,419
- The window. Something flew by.
- I didn't see anything.

87
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,557
Don't stand there, you idiot.
Go and look. Open the window.

88
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,398
Why did he have to
pick my building?

89
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,368
Is there a crowd in the street?
Maybe he's caught on a ledge.

90
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:27,186
- It must have been a seagull.
- A seagull?

91
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:29,921
What's a seagull doing
around the City Hall?

92
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,768
- That's a bad omen, isn't it?
- No, the seagull's a lovely bird.

93
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:37,015
It's alright, Mrs. Brewster.
It's just a seagull.

94
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,906
Nothing's happened yet.
I'm watching.

95
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,750
Don't worry.
Leave it all to me.

96
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,402
Spencer, I'll call you back.

97
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,442
Hello, Connell?

98
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,453
This is... What are you doing?
This is the Mayor.

99
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:50,981
Yes, Mayor Lovett.
How many times you gonna call me?

100
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:54,028
I've got everybody and his
brother and sister looking for him.

101
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,073
See the box I'm running?

102
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,609
"An appeal to John Doe.
Think it over, John.

103
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:03,093
Life can be beautiful,
says Mayor.

104
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:06,584
If you need a job, apply to
the editor and so forth..."

105
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:10,003
Okay, Mayor, I'll let you know
as soon as I have something.

106
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:11,397
What?

107
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,487
Well, pull down the blinds.

108
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:16,537
Went up to Miss Mitchell's house.
Boy, she's in a bad way.

109
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,988
- Where is she?
- Supports her mother and two kids.

110
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,631
- Did you find her?
- No. Her mother's worried.

111
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:26,125
She said she was going on
a roaring drunk, the girl I mean.

112
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:27,448
Go out and find her.

113
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,988
The biggest thing I didn't tell ya.
Her old man's Doc Mitchell.

114
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,391
He saved my mother's life
and wouldn't take money for it.

115
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,603
Okay, Boss. I'll look for her.

116
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,826
Holy smokes, Commissioner.
You've had 24 hours.

117
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:46,913
Okay, Hawkshaw, grab a pencil.
Here it is again.

118
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:51,202
About 5 foot five, brown eyes,

119
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,129
chestnut hair...

120
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:55,463
and as fine a pair of legs as...

121
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,630
ever walked into this office.

122
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:02,805
- Do you want to see me?
- No.

123
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:05,492
I've had the whole Army
and Navy searching for you

124
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,141
because it's a game we play.

125
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,024
I remember distinctly being fired.

126
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:13,033
That's right, but you have property
that belongs to this newspaper.

127
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,478
- What's that?
- The letter.

128
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:16,047
- What letter?
- The letter from John Doe.

129
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,812
The town's in an uproar, we got to
find it. It's the only clue.

130
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,711
- There is no letter.
- We'll get a handwriting expert to...

131
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:26,279
- What?
- There is no letter.

132
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:32,573
- Say that again.
- I made it up.

133
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,579
You made it up.

134
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:36,549
You said you wanted fireworks.

135
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:39,555
Don't you know there are
9 jobs waiting for this guy,

136
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:41,558
22 families want to
board him free,

137
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:45,254
5 women want to marry him
and the Mayor's ready to adopt him?

138
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:48,341
- Just called the morgue. A girl...
- Shut up!

139
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:51,268
Ann! Why didn't you...?

140
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:55,045
Only one thing to do, Hank.
Drop the whole business quickly.

141
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,685
Run a story.
Say John Doe was in here,

142
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,615
and is sorry he wrote the letter...

143
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:02,511
Sure. He came in here and
I made him change his mind.

144
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:05,434
"Bulletin Editor saves
John Doe's life." It's perfect.

145
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:06,755
I'll have Ned write it up.

146
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,769
- Ned, I got a story...
- Wait a minute.

147
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:13,016
Listen, you great big
genius of a newspaperman.

148
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,753
You came to shoot some life
into this dying newspaper.

149
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,355
Well, the whole town's
curious about John Doe and boom!

150
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:20,006
You're going to bury him.

151
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:23,212
There's enough circulation in
that man to start an ink shortage.

152
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,859
- In what man?
- John Doe.

153
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:27,863
- What John Doe?
- Ours. The one I made up.

154
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,913
Look genius. Now, look.

155
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,957
Suppose a John Doe walked into
this office? What would you do?

156
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,731
Find him a job and
forget the whole business, huh?

157
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:38,939
Not me.
I'd make a deal with him.

158
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,062
A deal?

159
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:43,115
You don't drop a stunt to
sell papers like a hot potato.

160
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,800
This is good for a couple of months.
Know what I'd do?

161
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:49,492
Between now and Christmas,
when he jumps, I'd run a daily yawn.

162
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:52,226
Starting with his boyhood,
his schooling, his first job.

163
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,861
A wide-eyed youngster
facing a chaotic world.

164
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,601
The problem of the average man,
all the John Does.

165
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,970
Then comes the drama.
He meets discouragement.

166
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,210
He finds the world has
feet of clay, his ideals crumble.

167
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,948
What does he do? He decides to

168
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,944
commit suicide in protest
against the state of civilization.

169
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,591
He thinks of the river, but no.
He has a better idea:

170
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:13,649
The City Hall. Why?
He wants to attract attention.

171
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:17,338
He want to get things off his chest
and it's the only way to be heard.

172
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,336
- So?
- So?

173
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:20,789
So he writes me a letter
and I dig him up.

174
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:23,715
He pours out his soul to me.
From now on we quote:

175
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,801
"I Protest", by John Doe.

176
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:28,445
He protests against
all the evils in the world.

177
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:31,700
The greed, lust, hate, fear.
All of man's inhumanity to man.

178
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,108
Arguments will start.
Should he commit suicide or not?

179
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,880
People will write in,
pleading with him. But no, sir!

180
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:39,564
John Doe will remain adamant.

181
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,373
On Christmas Eve,
hot or cold, he goes, see?

182
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:48,550
Very pretty, very pretty indeed,
Miss Mitchell.

183
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:51,641
But would you mind telling me
who goes on Christmas Eve?

184
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:53,246
- John Doe
- What John Doe?

185
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,057
The one we hire
for the job, you lunkhead.

186
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,461
Wait a minute. Let me get this
through this lame brain of mine.

187
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:02,596
We hire someone who says they'll
commit suicide on Christmas Eve?

188
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,995
Now you're catching on.

189
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:07,089
- Who for instance?
- Anybody. Beany'll do.

190
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:10,383
Why sure.
Who me? Jump off a...

191
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:12,944
Anytime but Christmas.
I'm superstitious.

192
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:22,262
Do me a favor. Go on out and
get married, have babies but...

193
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:23,746
stay out of the newspaper business.

194
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:26,144
Better get that story in hand.
It's getting late.

195
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:28,963
You're supposed to be a smart guy.
If it was raining 100 dollar bills,

196
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,727
you'd be looking for
a dime you lost someplace.

197
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:34,367
Holy smokes. Wasting my time
listening to this mad woman.

198
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,461
Look what the Chronicle's running
on John Doe. They say it's a fake.

199
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,468
Why the no-good...

200
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:42,794
"John Doe story,
amateur journalism.

201
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:46,252
This is so phony, it's a wonder
anyone's taking it seriously."

202
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,539
- What do you think of those guys?
- That's fine. That's fine.

203
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:51,273
Now fall into their laps. Go ahead.

204
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:53,750
Say John Doe walked in
and called the whole thing off.

205
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,076
You know what that'll sound like.

206
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:58,324
- That's all, Ned. Thank you.
- All right.

207
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:01,655
Amateur journalism, huh?

208
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,707
That bunch of sophomores.

209
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,000
- I could teach them more...
- Boss! Get a load of this.

210
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,646
- What?
- Look.

211
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:13,330
What do they want?

212
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,422
- They say they wrote the letter.
- Yeah, I wrote it, Boss.

213
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,149
They all wrote the letter.

214
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:22,036
Tell them all to wait.
One is your John Doe.

215
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,205
They're desperate and will
do anything for a cup of coffee.

216
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:27,102
Pick one and you can make
the Chronicle eat their words.

217
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,938
I'm beginning to like this.

218
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,677
If you ask me, Hank,
you're playing with dynamite.

219
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:33,355
No, the girl's right.

220
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,325
We can't let the Chronicle
get the laugh on us.

221
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,131
We've got to produce
a John Doe now.

222
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:40,101
Amateur journalism, huh?
I'll show those guys.

223
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:43,185
Sure and there's no reason
for them to find out the truth

224
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,635
because naturally
I won't say anything.

225
00:13:47,204 --> 00:13:50,172
- Okay, you get your job back.
- Plus a bonus.

226
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:52,412
- What bonus?
- The bonus of 1,000 dollars...

227
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,058
the Chronicle was going to
pay me for this little document.

228
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,235
"I, Ann Mitchell, certify that the
John Doe letter was created by me..."

229
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:01,479
- I can read. I can read.
- Sorry.

230
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,537
You think this is worth
1,000 dollars, do ya?

231
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,699
The Chronicle would
consider it dirt cheap.

232
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,187
Packs everything including a gun.

233
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,199
Okay, sister, you got a deal.
Let's look at the candidates.

234
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:16,406
The one we pick has got to be
the typical, average man.

235
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,933
Typical American
that can keep his mouth shut.

236
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:22,104
Show me an American who can keep
his mouth shut and I'll eat him.

237
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,754
Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.

238
00:15:30,122 --> 00:15:32,039
Did you write that letter?

239
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,292
- No, I didn't.
- What are you doing here then?

240
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,421
Paper says there were jobs.
Might be one left over.

241
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,229
Had any schooling?

242
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:43,275
Yeah. A little.

243
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:45,048
What do you do when you work?

244
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,247
- I used to pitch.
- Baseball?

245
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:50,340
Yeah, till my wing went bad.

246
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:51,703
Where did you play?

247
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:53,996
Bush leagues, mostly.

248
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,963
- Family? Got any family?
- No.

249
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:59,604
- Just traveling through?
- Yeah.

250
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:02,250
Me and a friend of mine.
He's outside.

251
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,795
- Looks alright.
- He's perfect. A baseball player.

252
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:10,719
What could be more American?

253
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,968
- Wish he had a family.
- Be less complicated without.

254
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,291
Look at that face. It's wonderful.

255
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:17,705
They'll believe him. Come on.

256
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,602
- What's your name.
- John Willoughby.

257
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,206
Long John Willoughby
they called me in baseball.

258
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,894
Would you like to make some money?

259
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:32,110
Yeah... maybe.

260
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:36,202
Would you be willing to say you
wrote that letter and stick by it?

261
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,025
I get the idea.

262
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,587
Yeah. Maybe.

263
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,493
That's our man.
He's made to order.

264
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:54,780
He don't seem like the guy
that'd fall in line.

265
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:57,386
When you're desperate for money,
you do a lot of things.

266
00:16:57,552 --> 00:17:00,314
He's our man I tell you.
He's fainted.

267
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,360
Get some water, quickly!

268
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,406
Hurry up, Hop.

269
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:05,330
Right here, sit down.

270
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:07,653
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

271
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,425
How many is that, six?

272
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,100
Pretty hungry, weren't you?

273
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:27,115
All this John Doe business
is batty, if you ask me.

274
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:28,721
Well nobody asked you.

275
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,658
Trying to improve the world
by jumping off buildings.

276
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,974
You couldn't improve the world
if the buildings jumped on you.

277
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,584
Don't mind the Colonel.
He hates people.

278
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:38,755
Likes you enough to stick around.

279
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,362
'Cause we both play doohickeys.

280
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:45,175
I met him in a boxcar
a couple of years ago.

281
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,466
I was fooling around with
my harmonica and he joins in.

282
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:50,593
Haven't shaken him since.

283
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:14,983
- Alright boys, here he is.
- No, you can't take photos of him

284
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:17,115
eating a sandwich
and with a beard.

285
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:19,639
- He's going to jump off a building.
- Not because he's out of a job.

286
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:22,408
That's not news.
He's jumping out of principle.

287
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:23,693
Maybe you're right.

288
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,740
We clean him up, put him in a hotel
under bodyguard. Make a mystery.

289
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:29,714
- Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
- Thinks it's terrific.

290
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,445
Wants us to build a bonfire under
every big shot in the state.

291
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,362
- Swell. Is that the contract?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,740
- What's he doing here?
- Friend of his. They play duets.

293
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:39,863
Duets? Can we trust him?

294
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:41,352
I trust him.

295
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:44,240
You trust him, eh?
I'm suppose he trusts you too.

296
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,286
Stop worrying. He's all right.

297
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:49,490
Okay, but we don't want more than
a hundred people in on this.

298
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,740
First, I want an exact copy
of the John Doe letter

299
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:53,629
in your own handwriting.

300
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,194
I got it already. Here.

301
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:56,588
That's fine.

302
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,396
Now sign this agreement.

303
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:02,456
It gives us an exclusive story
under your name, day by day

304
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,535
from now until Christmas.

305
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:07,554
On December 26th,
you get one railroad ticket

306
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,310
out of town.

307
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,401
The Bulletin pays to have
your arm fixed. It's what you want?

308
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,486
Yeah, but it's got to be by
Bone-setter Brown.

309
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,462
Okay, Bone-setter Brown goes.
Here, sign it.

310
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,827
Meanwhile, here's
50 dollars spending money.

311
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,829
That's fine. Beany?

312
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,560
Take charge of him. A suite at
the Imperial and bodyguards.

313
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:27,213
And some new clothes.

314
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,531
- Think we better have him deloused?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,622
- Both of them?
- Yes, but don't lose them.

316
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,073
- Beany, gray suit, huh?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,392
Okay, fellas.

318
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:43,221
Take it easy, John Doe.

319
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:49,362
And you start pounding
that typewriter.

320
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,125
This is terrific.
No responsibilities on our part,

321
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,687
just statements from John Doe
and we can blast our heads off.

322
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:58,658
Before you pop your buttons,
don't forget that check for 1,000.

323
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,355
Yeah.

324
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,130
Okay, fellas, you sit outside
and nobody comes in.

325
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,448
You two fellas sit in here.

326
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,461
Pretty nifty, huh?

327
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:13,466
- You won't get me to stay here.
- Sure you are.

328
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:17,119
No. Under the bridge, where we slept
last night is good enough for me.

329
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,047
- What do I do with this baggage?
- Stick it in the bedroom.

330
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,861
Give me mine. I ain't staying.

331
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,183
We were headed for
the Columbia River country

332
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:28,399
before this John Doe business
came up. You remember don't ya?

333
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:29,681
Sure, I remember.

334
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:32,050
Did your ears pop coming up
in the elevator? Mine did.

335
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,132
Long John, I tell ya.
It's no good.

336
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,343
You'll get used to a lot of stuff
that's gonna wreck you.

337
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:39,509
That 50 bucks in your pocket
is beginning to show up on you.

338
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,321
Don't pull that on me neither.

339
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:44,004
Stop worrying. I'll get my arm
fixed out of this.

340
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,613
Here's some cigars
the boss sent us. Have one.

341
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,582
- Colonel?
- No.

342
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,103
I bet even the major leaguers
don't rate an outfit like this.

343
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:02,861
Make yourself comfortable.
Paper?

344
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,999
I don't read no papers and
I don't listen to radios neither.

345
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:10,763
World's been shaved by a
drunken barber. Don't have to read.

346
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,459
I've seen guys like you go under.

347
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,630
Guys that never had a worry,
got some money and went goofy.

348
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:21,364
First thing that happens to a guy...

349
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,364
- Get a load of the bedroom.
- No.

350
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:27,502
First thing that happens is he
starts wanting to go to restaurants

351
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:31,917
and eat salad
and cupcakes and tea.

352
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,078
What that kind of food
does to your system.

353
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,462
Next, the dope wants a room.

354
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,708
A room with steam heat,

355
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,316
and curtains and rugs.

356
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:49,531
He softens up till he
can't sleep unless he has a bed.

357
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,737
Stop worrying, Colonel.
50 bucks ain't gonna ruin me.

358
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:54,900
I've seen plenty of fellas
start out with 50 bucks

359
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,907
and wind up with
a bank account.

360
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,560
What's the matter
with a bank account, anyway?

361
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:02,486
Let me tell you, Long John,
when you got a bank account,

362
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,780
they got ya!
Yes sir, the got ya.

363
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:09,230
- Who's got him?
- The Heelots.

364
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,386
Who?

365
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:13,240
There's the City Hall tower
I'm supposed to jump off of.

366
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,890
It's even higher than this.

367
00:22:15,052 --> 00:22:17,573
- Who's got him?
- The Heelots.

368
00:22:19,145 --> 00:22:20,661
Wait a minute.

369
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:22,753
That's not till Christmas Eve.

370
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,719
Want to get me in a jam?

371
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:28,008
If it gets you in a jam,
I'll do you a favor. I won't jump.

372
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:33,337
When they got ya, you got
no more chance than a road rabbit.

373
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,106
Who was going to get him?

374
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:37,636
Is this one of those places where
you ring if you want something?

375
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:40,849
- Yeah, just use the phone.
- I always wanted to do that.

376
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:42,889
Hey, Doc, look.

377
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:47,141
Give me that again, will ya?
Who's gonna get him?

378
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:48,750
The Heelots.

379
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:50,114
Who are they?

380
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,729
- Listen, you ever been broke?
- Mostly often.

381
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:54,884
All right.

382
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:58,821
You're walking along, not a nickel,
free as the wind, nobody bothers you.

383
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:01,145
Hundreds pass you by
in every line of business:

384
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:04,397
shoes, hats, automobiles,
radios, furniture, everything.

385
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:07,406
They're all nice, loveable people
and they let you alone.

386
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:08,806
Now, is that right?

387
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,816
Then you get hold of some dough,
and what happens?

388
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,515
All those nice, sweet,
loveable people

389
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:18,565
become Heelots. A lot of heels!

390
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:23,058
The begin creepin' up on you.
Trying to sell you stuff.

391
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:27,109
They get long claws and they
get a stranglehold on you.

392
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:28,951
You squirm and you duck

393
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,435
and you holler,
but you haven't got a chance.

394
00:23:31,607 --> 00:23:32,760
They got ya.

395
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:36,618
First thing you know,
you own things. A car, for instance.

396
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:39,626
Now your whole life is
messed up with more stuff:

397
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,513
You got license fees
and number plates,

398
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,522
gas and oil, taxes and insurance,

399
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,213
and identification cards
and letters

400
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,422
and bills
and flat tires and dents

401
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,470
and traffic tickets
and motorcycle cops

402
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:56,559
and courtrooms, lawyers, fines
and a million other things.

403
00:23:57,127 --> 00:23:58,483
And what happens?

404
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:02,456
You're not the free and
happy guy you used to be.

405
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:05,351
You got to have money
to pay for all those things.

406
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,829
So you go after
what the other fella's got.

407
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:11,288
And there you are.
You're a Heelot yourself.

408
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:22,194
You win, Colonel.
Take the fifty.

409
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:26,370
- Go out and get rid of it.
- You bet. Fast as I can.

410
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:30,464
I'll get can goods, a fishing rod,
the rest I'll give away.

411
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:32,062
Give away?

412
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:35,161
Get me a pitcher's glove.
I got to get some practice.

413
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,728
Say, he's giving it away,
I'm gonna get me some.

414
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,858
Come back here, you Heelot.

415
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,717
Send up 5 hamburgers
with all the trimmings,

416
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:49,284
5 ice cream sodas

417
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,445
and 5 pieces of apple pie.

418
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:54,898
No, apple. With cheese.

419
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:56,459
Yeah, thanks.

420
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,431
Hello there.

421
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:15,120
Well, well.

422
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,245
If it isn't the man about town.

423
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,376
All set, Miss Ann.

424
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,427
Oh, yes. Let's go.

425
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:26,673
Let's see. We want some
action in these pictures.

426
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:27,756
Action?

427
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:31,406
Action!

428
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:33,815
No, no. This man's
going to jump off a roof.

429
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:36,872
Wait a minute.
Let me comb your hair.

430
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:42,811
There, that's better.

431
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:52,555
He's got a nice face, hasn't he?

432
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:54,241
Yeah, he's pretty.

433
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:58,732
Here, sit down.
Quiet, egghead.

434
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:01,501
Now a serious expression.

435
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:04,593
- I can't. I'm feeling too good.
- Come on, this is serious.

436
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,408
You're a man disgusted
with all of civilization.

437
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:10,331
- With all of it?
- Yes, you're sore at the world.

438
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,581
- Crabby guy, huh?
- Yeah.

439
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:16,666
No, no!

440
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:19,475
No.

441
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:23,647
Look...

442
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:26,056
you don't have to smell the world.

443
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:30,549
- With those guys in the bleachers.
- Never mind those guys.

444
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:31,952
Stand up.

445
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,566
See what you look like protesting.

446
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,776
- Against what?
- Against anything, just protest.

447
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,585
You got me.

448
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:42,355
Look, I'm the umpire.

449
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,676
You cut the plate with
a fast one and I call it a ball.

450
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,450
- Now what would you do?
- You did, huh?

451
00:26:48,976 --> 00:26:51,293
Why can't you call it right?
You bone-headed, big-eared...

452
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,187
Grab it, Eddy. Grab it.

453
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,432
Extra! Extra!

454
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:28,416
Read all about it!
Extra!

455
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:48,720
I don't care who's picture
they're publishing,

456
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:51,927
I still say this
John Doe person is a myth.

457
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,528
You can quote me on that.

458
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:57,062
I'm going to insist on his being
produced for questioning.

459
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:00,155
You know as well as I do
that this whole thing

460
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:02,793
is being engineered
by a vicious man

461
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,482
with a vicious purpose.

462
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,087
Mr. D.B. Norton.

463
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,648
Mr. Connell and Miss Mitchell
are at the house, sir.

464
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:33,697
Oh, they are?
Come on.

465
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:38,349
Personally, I think it's
stupidity to drop it now.

466
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:42,155
His fan mail is in the thousands.
It's going like a house afire.

467
00:28:42,326 --> 00:28:45,089
What are you afraid of, Connell?
It's doubled our circulation.

468
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:46,932
But it's got everybody sore.

469
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,669
Ads are being pulled.
Governor's starting a libel suit.

470
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,432
They all know he's a phony
and insist on seeing him.

471
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,486
Let them see him?
We'll let them hear him.

472
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,965
You own a radio station.
Why not put him on the air?

473
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,372
Watch out for this dame, D.B.,
she'll drive you batty.

474
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,190
We can't let them start pumping
this bush league pitcher.

475
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:05,920
No telling what
that screwball might do.

476
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,446
I walk in yesterday, he's on
a table with a fishing pole,

477
00:29:09,611 --> 00:29:10,843
fly-casting.

478
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,697
Get him out of town before
this thing explodes in our faces.

479
00:29:13,864 --> 00:29:16,670
You do and you're as much of
a dumb cluck as he is. Excuse me.

480
00:29:16,832 --> 00:29:19,960
- You got yourself a meal ticket.
- Sure it is, I admit...

481
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:23,730
but it's also a windfall for
Mr. Norton who wants into politics.

482
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,655
That's why you bought the paper,
to reach a lot of people?

483
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:29,585
Put John Doe on the air
and you'll reach 130 million.

484
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,910
He can say anything he wants.

485
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,967
Forget the Governor and the Mayor
and all the small fry.

486
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:37,012
This can arouse national interest.

487
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,982
If he made a hit here,
he can do it around the country.

488
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,031
And you'll be
pulling the strings, Mr. Norton.

489
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:47,839
Arrange for some radio time.

490
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,291
- D.B...
- As soon as possible.

491
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:56,272
Okay. I just came in
to get warm myself.

492
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:57,999
Come on, let's go.

493
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:01,040
Don't you go.
I want to talk to you.

494
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,427
Sit down.

495
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,641
This John Doe idea
was yours, wasn't it?

496
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:29,728
Yes, sir.

497
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,675
- How much money do you get?
- 30 dollars.

498
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:40,771
30 dollars.

499
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:44,422
Well, what are you after? I mean...

500
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:47,711
- You want a journalistic career?
- Money.

501
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:51,836
Money. Well, I'm glad
to hear somebody admit it.

502
00:30:55,057 --> 00:30:59,061
Could you write a radio speech
to put that fellow over?

503
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,157
- I'm sure I can.
- Do and I'll give you 100 a week.

504
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,515
- 100 dollars.
- That's only the beginning.

505
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:08,206
Play your cards right and you'll
never worry about money again.

506
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,342
I knew it.

507
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:12,820
Whenever there's
a pretty woman around...

508
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:15,114
This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon.
Miss Mitchell.

509
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:16,556
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

510
00:31:16,723 --> 00:31:20,010
I'll give you a break, Casanova.
See Miss Mitchell gets a car home.

511
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:22,175
Always reading my mind.

512
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,579
Thank you for everything.

513
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,786
And Miss Mitchell,

514
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:29,757
from now on,
you better work directly from me.

515
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:31,477
Yes, sir.

516
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:10,162
- I thought you were asleep.
- We want to say goodnight.

517
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:13,692
You little brats,
you're just stalling.

518
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,466
Come, children.
It's past your bedtime.

519
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,194
Oh, all right.

520
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,798
Come on, come on.

521
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,568
If Scootch will
stay for me, I'm done.

522
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:26,330
I'll never get this speech right.

523
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:28,860
Yes you will, Ann dear.
You're very clever.

524
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:30,384
Yeah, I know.
What are you looking for?

525
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,470
Your purse.
I need ten dollars.

526
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,523
What for?
I gave you fifty the other day.

527
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,168
I know, but Mrs. Burke had
her baby yesterday. Nine pounds.

528
00:32:39,579 --> 00:32:41,335
There wasn't a thing in the house.

529
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,228
Then,
the Community Chest lady came.

530
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,628
And the 50 dollars is gone.
Who's the 10 for?

531
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,201
- The Websters.
- The Websters.

532
00:32:47,363 --> 00:32:49,884
You remember those lovely people
your father used to take care of?

533
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,173
I thought I'd buy them groceries.

534
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,901
Ann, it's a shame those poor...

535
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:56,791
You're marvelous,
just like father used to be.

536
00:32:56,953 --> 00:33:00,033
You realize a couple of weeks ago
we didn't have enough to eat?

537
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:03,968
But these people are in such need
and we have plenty now.

538
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:06,737
If you mean the 1,000 dollars,
forget it. It's practically gone.

539
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:08,387
We owed everybody in town.

540
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:10,748
You got to stop
giving all your money away.

541
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:12,147
Oh, Ann dear.

542
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,606
I'm sorry, Ma.
Don't pay any attention to me.

543
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,008
I guess I'm just
all upset about all this.

544
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:21,019
Here I am with a great
opportunity to get somewhere,

545
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:23,755
to give you security for once,
and I'm stuck.

546
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:27,076
If I could put this over,
Mrs. Burke can have six babies.

547
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:31,217
- The speech you're writing?
- Yeah. I can't get it to gel.

548
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:33,775
I created somebody who's
giving up his life for a principle.

549
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,594
Thousands of people are going to
listen to him over the radio,

550
00:33:36,754 --> 00:33:39,277
and unless he says
something sensational,

551
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:41,005
it's just no good.

552
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:44,809
I don't know what kind of
speech you're going to write,

553
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,779
but from the samples I've read,
I don't think anybody will listen.

554
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:50,024
What?

555
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:53,684
There are so many
complaining, political speeches.

556
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:57,494
People are tired of hearing
doom and despair on the radio.

557
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,745
If you're going to have him
say anything,

558
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,556
why not something simple
and real, with hope in it?

559
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,643
Your father were alive, he'd know.

560
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,244
Yeah.

561
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:11,213
Father certainly would.

562
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:14,028
Wait a minute.

563
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:33,280
That's your father's diary, Ann.

564
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,576
Father's...?
I never knew he had a diary.

565
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,862
Enough for 100 speeches.

566
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:41,068
Things people ought to hear now.

567
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:43,593
Be careful of it, won't you.

568
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:46,158
It's always helped to keep
your father alive for me.

569
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:48,247
You bet I will, Ma.

570
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:51,015
We wanna see him!

571
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:54,106
Wait a minute, John Doe
don't want to sign autographs.

572
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:57,195
- Well, what does he do all day?
- What does he do all day?

573
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:59,965
- He's writing out his memories.
- Please!

574
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:03,179
Sorry, lady. You can't see Mr. Doe.
He wants to be alone.

575
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:06,982
No, he sits around all day
and commutes with himself.

576
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:14,255
Ball!

577
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:27,214
I don't know how you'll
stand it here till after Christmas.

578
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:33,544
You ain't heard a train whistle
in two weeks.

579
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:43,500
Strike!

580
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,551
I know why you're hanging around.

581
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:07,491
You're stuck on the girl.

582
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:13,432
All I guy needs is to get
hooked up with a woman.

583
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:31,969
Was that a single?

584
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,421
First baseman dropped the ball.

585
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:36,703
Butterfingers!

586
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,224
Tough luck, pal.

587
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:46,210
Guy has a woman on his hands,

588
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,541
first thing he knows his life
is balled up with more things.

589
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:51,594
Furniture.

590
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,743
Did you get him?

591
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:06,269
You're out!

592
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:09,765
- This the end of the 8th?
- The 9th.

593
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:17,787
Beany, a couple of mugs from
the Chronicle are snooping around.

594
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:23,131
Come on, Angel Face.

595
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:28,338
- What's the score, Angel Face?
- 3 to 2, our favor.

596
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:29,913
Gee, that's great!

597
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:39,218
You got swell form.
Must have been a good pitcher.

598
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,626
Pretty good? I was about ready
for the majors when I chipped

599
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,840
a bone in my elbow.
Got it pitching a 19 inning game.

600
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,679
- 19?
- Yeah.

601
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,007
A major league scout was watching.

602
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:52,174
He came down after
with a contract.

603
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:56,030
You know what? I couldn't
lift my arm to sign it.

604
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:59,885
- I'll be okay when I'm fixed up.
- Yeah, it's too bad.

605
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:02,242
What do you mean 'too bad'?

606
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:05,416
That you'll never play again.

607
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:08,827
What are you talking about?
I just told you...

608
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,756
You know how they are in baseball
if a guy's mixed up in a racket.

609
00:38:12,244 --> 00:38:13,728
Racket? What do you mean?

610
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,172
I was thinking about
this John Doe business.

611
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,863
As soon as it comes out
it's all a fake,

612
00:38:20,029 --> 00:38:22,469
you'll be washed up
in baseball, won't you?

613
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,795
Yeah.

614
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:30,657
Doggone.
I never thought about that.

615
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,917
- Gosh!
- And what about the kids?

616
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,214
The kids that
idolize ball players?

617
00:38:42,378 --> 00:38:44,020
What will they think about ya?

618
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:46,178
Yeah.

619
00:38:46,912 --> 00:38:47,984
Hey, Colonel.

620
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:52,362
Did you hear that?

621
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:55,292
I got to figure
some way out of this thing.

622
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,415
Elevators are still running.

623
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,191
- I know one way you can do it.
- How?

624
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:03,956
When you get on the radio,

625
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,440
all you have to do is say
the whole thing's a frame-up

626
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,735
Make you a hero,
sure as you're born.

627
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:12,298
Yeah, but how am I
going to get my arm fixed?

628
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:13,953
That's a cinch.

629
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,594
I know somebody who'll
give you 5,000 dollars

630
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:19,885
- to tell the truth on the radio.
- 5,000 dollars.

631
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:22,943
Yeah, 5,000 dollars
and he gets it right away.

632
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:24,946
Don't have to wait till Christmas.

633
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:28,712
Look out, Long John,
they're closing in on you.

634
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:32,006
Say, who's putting up this dough?

635
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:34,175
Fella runs the Chronicle.

636
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:39,071
Here's the speech you make
all written for you.

637
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,800
5,000 dollars.

638
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:45,886
Holy mackerel!
I can see the Heelots coming.

639
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,206
The whole army of them.

640
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:50,816
It's on the level.

641
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:05,029
No, I'm sorry, tickets for
the broadcast are all gone.

642
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:06,595
Phone the Bulletin.

643
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:08,566
Sorry, no more tickets left.

644
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,815
All set for the big night?
Swell!

645
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:25,019
- Turn around. Now stand still.
- Hold it, Mr. Doe.

646
00:40:25,907 --> 00:40:27,551
Big smile, Mr. Doe.

647
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:30,998
- Okay, Beany, that's enough.
- Alright, scram now.

648
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:34,242
John, here's the speech.
It's in caps and double spaced.

649
00:40:34,414 --> 00:40:35,852
You'll have no trouble reading it.

650
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,542
Not nervous, are you?
Of course not, he wouldn't be.

651
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,752
- Who?
- John Doe. The one in there.

652
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:43,073
Don't let your knees rattle.
It picks up on the mike.

653
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:46,772
You needn't be nervous.
Remember to be sincere.

654
00:40:46,937 --> 00:40:49,094
- It's for you, Miss Mitchell.
- Okay.

655
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:51,661
Hello? Yes, mother.
Thank you, darling.

656
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:55,761
There he is, the poor dear man.

657
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:59,294
Good luck to you, Mr. Doe.
We are all for you.

658
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,421
The girls all decided

659
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:04,747
that you're not to jump off
any roof at all.

660
00:41:06,241 --> 00:41:08,559
- Got the speech I gave ya?
- Yeah.

661
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,936
I'll give the money to the Colonel

662
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:14,064
as soon as you get started.

663
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,345
We'll have a car waiting
at the side entrance for you.

664
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,114
How'd you get in here?

665
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:21,169
- Just came to wish him luck.
- Come on, out! Out!

666
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:23,691
Mother says 'good luck', too.

667
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:26,862
John, when you read the speech,
please believe every word.

668
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,029
He turned out to be wonderful.

669
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,595
- Who?
- John Doe, the one in the speech.

670
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:35,335
Know something? I've actually
fallen in love with him.

671
00:41:36,182 --> 00:41:38,145
All right, there he is, sister.
Plenty of bulk.

672
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:40,591
- What's the idea?
- No, that's too much.

673
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:43,361
No, not so much. Now come on.

674
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:46,048
This is no time for
cheap publicity, Mr. Connell.

675
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:48,943
If that guy lays an egg,
I want something out of it.

676
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,429
I'm getting a Jane Doe ready.

677
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:53,953
Come on, will you fellas?
Give me a chance.

678
00:41:54,123 --> 00:41:56,645
Just one more, please?

679
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:57,804
Fine honey, you go ahead.

680
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:58,967
How you doing?

681
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:00,576
Alright Beany, bring them in.

682
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,382
Holy smoke! Half a Heelot.

683
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:06,924
There you are, boss.
Symbols of little people.

684
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:08,729
- Okay, get 'em up.
- Alright little fella.

685
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:12,785
This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell.
He's on the air in a few minutes.

686
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:16,233
You'll get all your pictures after.

687
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:17,956
Come on, Ed.

688
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,323
Come on. That's right.

689
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,532
- Pictures afterwards.
- Thank you very much.

690
00:42:24,263 --> 00:42:25,941
Come on, Snooks.
You better bail out.

691
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,914
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

692
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:30,601
- Beany!
- Alright, alright.

693
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,615
Get ready. One minute to go.

694
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:36,615
And the score's nothing to nothing.

695
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:39,912
Now please, John.
You won't let me down, will ya?

696
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,358
Will ya?

697
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:44,686
Of course you won't.

698
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:47,774
If you just think of yourself
as the real John Doe...

699
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:52,111
Everything in that speech
are things a man believed in.

700
00:42:52,277 --> 00:42:54,035
It was my father, John.

701
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:56,763
And when he talked,
people listened.

702
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:58,850
And they'll listen to you, too.

703
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:00,573
Funny...

704
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:03,505
you know what my mother said?

705
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:07,637
She said to look into your eyes,
that I'd see my father there.

706
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:12,695
- What do you say?
- Okay, we're coming.

707
00:43:13,909 --> 00:43:17,550
Listen, John. You're a pitcher.
Get in there and pitch.

708
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:20,680
Good luck.

709
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,526
Let him through.

710
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,794
Let's get out of here.
The door's right there.

711
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:42,399
- What are you doing here?
- That's what I'd like to know.

712
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:43,970
- Come on, out!
- He's a friend of mine.

713
00:43:44,131 --> 00:43:46,173
Never mind. Let him alone.

714
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,584
I'll be over there pulling for you.

715
00:43:53,482 --> 00:43:55,206
No, John, over here.

716
00:44:00,466 --> 00:44:01,378
Stand by.

717
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:36,544
Phone the Chronicle.
Tell 'em to get the Extras out.

718
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:02,002
Good evening, Kenneth Fry
speaking for the New Bulletin.

719
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,974
Tonight we give you something
entirely new and different.

720
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:08,023
Beside me is the young man
who has declared publicly that

721
00:45:08,268 --> 00:45:11,028
on Christmas Eve he will suicide,

722
00:45:11,357 --> 00:45:13,513
giving as his reason,

723
00:45:13,684 --> 00:45:15,690
"I protest against
the state of civilization."

724
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:16,842
End quote.

725
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,856
Ladies and gentlemen,
the New Bulletin presents

726
00:45:20,024 --> 00:45:22,626
the man who is fast becoming
the most talked about person

727
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:25,360
in the country, John Doe.

728
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,671
Ladies and gentlemen...

729
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:56,048
I am the man you all know
as John Doe.

730
00:45:57,021 --> 00:46:00,227
I took that name because
it seems to describe...

731
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:04,563
because it seems to describe

732
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:07,771
the average man,
and that's me.

733
00:46:08,257 --> 00:46:09,579
And that's me.

734
00:46:13,673 --> 00:46:17,234
Well, it was me before I said
I was going to jump off

735
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:19,721
the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve.

736
00:46:20,816 --> 00:46:23,132
I guess I'm not average anymore.

737
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:27,394
Now I'm getting all sorts
of attention, from big shots too.

738
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:28,880
We've been double crossed.

739
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:31,084
The Mayor and Governor,
for instance, they don't like

740
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:35,215
- ... those articles I wrote.
- You're an impostor, young fella!

741
00:46:35,381 --> 00:46:37,139
It's a pack of lies you're telling!

742
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:39,824
Who wrote that speech for you?

743
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:43,483
Beany, get that guy!

744
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,623
publicity stunt for the Bulletin.

745
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:54,837
Spencer.

746
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,126
Ladies and gentlemen,
the disturbance you just heard

747
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,452
was caused by someone in
the audience heckling Mr. Doe.

748
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:02,424
The speech will continue.

749
00:47:07,082 --> 00:47:10,368
Well, people like the Governor...

750
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:14,341
people like the Governor
and that fella can stop worrying.

751
00:47:14,987 --> 00:47:18,547
I'm not gonna talk about them.
I'm gonna talk about us,

752
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,722
the average man, the John Does.

753
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:25,530
If anybody ever asked you
what the average John Doe is like,

754
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:29,227
you couldn't tell him because
he's a million and one things.

755
00:47:30,073 --> 00:47:32,391
He's Mr. Big
and Mr. Small.

756
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:35,928
He's simple and he's wise.
He's inherently honest,

757
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:38,055
but he's got a streak of
larceny in his heart.

758
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,942
He seldom walks up to a public
telephone without shoving

759
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:43,957
his finger in the slot to see
if somebody left a nickel.

760
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:58,477
He's the man the ads
are written for,

761
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:01,166
the fella everybody
sells things to.

762
00:48:01,614 --> 00:48:04,774
He's Joe Dokes,
the world's greatest stooge,

763
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:07,022
and the world's greatest strength.

764
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,503
Yes, sir...

765
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:21,275
Yes, sir, we're a great family,
the John Does.

766
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:25,237
We're the meek who are...
supposed to inherit the earth.

767
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:29,818
You'll find us everywhere.
We raise the crops, dig the mines,

768
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:33,065
work the factories,
keep the books, fly the planes,

769
00:48:33,234 --> 00:48:36,601
and drive the buses.
When a cop yells "Stand back, you",

770
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:39,047
he means us, the John Does.

771
00:48:39,212 --> 00:48:41,609
What kind of a speech is that?
Didn't you read it?

772
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:45,228
We've existed since time began.
We built the Pyramids,

773
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,594
we saw Christ crucified,

774
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,876
pulled the oars
for Roman emperors,

775
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:51,770
sailed the boats for Columbus,

776
00:48:52,454 --> 00:48:54,895
retreated from Moscow with Napoleon,

777
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:57,664
and froze with Washington
at Valley Forge.

778
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:01,432
Yes, sir,

779
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:03,999
we've been in there
dodging left hooks

780
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:06,408
since before History
began to walk.

781
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,748
In our struggle for freedom
we've hit the canvas many a time,

782
00:49:09,909 --> 00:49:13,629
but we always bounce back because
we're the people and we're tough.

783
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:21,419
They've started a lot of talk
about free people going soft,

784
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:24,554
that we can't take it.
That's a lot of hooey!

785
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:28,926
Free people can beat the world
at anything from war

786
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,771
to tiddlywinks if we all
pull in the same direction.

787
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,644
I know a lot of you are saying:
What can I do?

788
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,460
I'm just a little punk.
I don't count.

789
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:48,185
You're dead wrong.
Little punks have always counted

790
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,919
because in the long run
the character of a country

791
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,047
is the sum total of
the character of it's little punks.

792
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:03,473
But we've all got to
get in there and pitch.

793
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:06,685
We can't win the old ball game
unless we have team work,

794
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,656
and that's where
every John Doe comes in.

795
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:12,745
It's up to him to
get together with his team mate,

796
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:15,711
and your team mate, my friends,

797
00:50:15,878 --> 00:50:17,601
is the guy next door to you.

798
00:50:17,843 --> 00:50:21,735
Your neighbor, he's a
terribly important guy.

799
00:50:22,257 --> 00:50:24,255
You and he need each other,

800
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:27,312
so call him up.
If he's sick, call on him.

801
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,277
If he's hungry, feed him.

802
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,757
If he's out of a job,
find him one.

803
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:34,573
To most of you,
your neighbor is a stranger.

804
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:37,545
A guy with a barking dog
and a high fence around him.

805
00:50:37,706 --> 00:50:41,233
You can't be a stranger to
a guy that's on your own team.

806
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,166
So tear down the fence
that separates you.

807
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:48,413
Tear it down and you'll tear down
a lot of hates and prejudices.

808
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:50,378
Tear down all the fences

809
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:52,829
and you'll really have teamwork.

810
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,341
I know a lot of you
are saying to yourselves:

811
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:05,231
"He's asking for a miracle.

812
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:08,121
He's expecting people
to change all of a sudden."

813
00:51:08,363 --> 00:51:09,435
Well, you're wrong.

814
00:51:09,606 --> 00:51:11,524
It's no miracle.
It's no miracle...

815
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:15,459
because I see it happen
once a year and so do you,

816
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:17,384
at Christmas time.

817
00:51:18,314 --> 00:51:21,120
There's something swell
about the spirit of Christmas.

818
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:24,170
To see what it does to people,
all kinds of people.

819
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:27,782
Now why can't that spirit,

820
00:51:27,945 --> 00:51:30,832
that same warm Christmas spirit,
last the whole year round?

821
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:32,307
Gosh!

822
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,767
If it ever did,
if each and every John Doe

823
00:51:36,933 --> 00:51:40,060
made that spirit last 365 days,

824
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,901
we'd develop such a strength,

825
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,151
we'd create such a tidal wave
of goodwill that no human force

826
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,438
could stand against it.

827
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:49,692
Yes sir, my friends,

828
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:53,659
the meek can only inherit the earth

829
00:51:53,826 --> 00:51:56,108
when the John Does
start loving their neighbors.

830
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:58,793
You better start right now.

831
00:51:59,323 --> 00:52:02,326
Don't wait till the game
is called on account of darkness.

832
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:06,580
Wake up, John Doe,
you're the hope of the world.

833
00:52:15,454 --> 00:52:16,892
John, you were wonderful.

834
00:52:18,424 --> 00:52:19,987
Bravo! Bravo!

835
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:27,042
- Let's get out of here.
- Now you're talking.

836
00:52:34,676 --> 00:52:36,673
Gangway, you Heelots!

837
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:48,473
I knew you'd wake up
sooner or later.

838
00:52:49,202 --> 00:52:51,563
Boy, am I glad
we got out of that mess.

839
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,976
I had the 5,000 all sewed up.
Could've gone to Doc Brown.

840
00:52:58,591 --> 00:53:01,318
"You're a pitcher.", she says.
"Go in and pitch."

841
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,157
What a sucker!

842
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,407
She's a Heelot just like the rest.
Lucky you got away from her.

843
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:09,497
What was I doing making
a speech, anyway? Me?

844
00:53:09,907 --> 00:53:13,272
- The more I think about it...!
- Tear town all the fences.

845
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:16,484
If you tore one picket off your
neighbor's fence, he'd sue you.

846
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:19,085
5,000 bucks,
had it right in my hand.

847
00:53:19,616 --> 00:53:21,294
What do you mean
"he ran away"?

848
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:23,825
Find him.
That man is terrific.

849
00:53:32,056 --> 00:53:34,132
Columbia River, here we come!

850
00:54:21,612 --> 00:54:23,449
- Jitterbugs.
- Yeah.

851
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:28,062
- How much money we got left?
- Four bits.

852
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,151
- Better make it doughnuts, huh?
- Yeah.

853
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,082
What'll it be, gents?

854
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,931
Have you got a couple of steaks
about that big and that thick?

855
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:51,139
Yeah, with hash brown potatoes
and tomatoes and apple pie...

856
00:54:51,306 --> 00:54:54,228
- and ice cream and coffee?
- And doughnuts, I know.

857
00:54:54,396 --> 00:54:56,964
Hey, Ma! Sinkers, a pair.

858
00:54:57,365 --> 00:54:59,008
Sinkers, a pair. Comin' up.

859
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,974
Glad he took the 't' out of that.

860
00:55:06,113 --> 00:55:07,470
Look at that.

861
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:10,843
Join the John Doe Club.

862
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:13,774
John Doe Club?

863
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:24,118
Are you John Doe?

864
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:25,934
- Who?
- John Doe.

865
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:27,659
You need glasses, buddy.

866
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:29,864
It's the spitting image
of John Doe.

867
00:55:30,028 --> 00:55:31,351
Yeah, but his name's Willoughby.

868
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:33,795
I'm John Willoughby.
I'm a baseball player.

869
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:37,247
No, I'd know that voice anywhere.
You can't kid me.

870
00:55:37,653 --> 00:55:39,090
You're John Doe.

871
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:40,289
Ma!

872
00:55:40,542 --> 00:55:42,664
Ma!
That's John Doe!

873
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:45,431
- John Doe!
- Sitting right there, big as life.

874
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:48,440
- Who'd you say it was?
- John Doe. The big guy there.

875
00:55:50,734 --> 00:55:52,218
That's John Doe.

876
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,138
It's John Doe!

877
00:55:54,746 --> 00:55:56,470
John Doe!

878
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,717
John Doe!

879
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:05,047
Operator, Dan Beaver.
Call everybody in town.

880
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:08,746
John Doe was just in my place.
Yeah, he ordered doughnuts.

881
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,797
You're all here to see John Doe
and you're all neighbors,

882
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:26,959
but my office is packed
like a sardine box.

883
00:56:27,128 --> 00:56:28,932
What does John Doe
look like, Mr. Mayor?

884
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,411
He's one of those
great, big, outdoor type men.

885
00:56:31,582 --> 00:56:34,665
You can't see him, you didn't
vote for me. What are you doing?

886
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,274
Get off my front porch.
Mr. Norton come yet?

887
00:56:37,722 --> 00:56:40,723
What's keeping him?
Should've been here 15 minutes ago.

888
00:56:40,972 --> 00:56:42,091
There he comes now.

889
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:47,180
Everybody on your dignity.

890
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:49,509
Don't disgrace our little town.
We gotta show off.

891
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:54,001
Better let me talk to him.

892
00:56:54,174 --> 00:56:56,777
Present it to him as
a great cause for the common man.

893
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:59,383
Here he comes.
Give him room, folks.

894
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:03,797
Here they come.
Here's Mr. Norton.

895
00:57:04,246 --> 00:57:06,722
How do you do, Mr. Norton?
I'm the Mayor.

896
00:57:07,095 --> 00:57:08,293
The crowd back there!

897
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:11,187
Let me to, you darn fool.
I'm the Mayor.

898
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:15,437
I'm Mayor Hawkins!
Your office phoned me to hold him.

899
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:18,249
- That's fine. How is he?
- He's fine. He's in my office.

900
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:20,693
It's a big honor having
John Doe here, and you too.

901
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:23,095
Haven't had so much excitement
since the old City Hall burnt down.

902
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:26,187
People so excited,
they nearly tore his clothes off.

903
00:57:26,355 --> 00:57:28,831
Matilda, phone the newspapers.
Tell them Mr. Norton's here.

904
00:57:29,004 --> 00:57:30,807
Step inside my office, Mr. Norton.

905
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,253
It should be comfortable.
I just had it air-conditioned.

906
00:57:33,418 --> 00:57:36,066
Make room for Mr. Norton.

907
00:57:36,627 --> 00:57:37,951
Gangway, gangway.

908
00:57:38,113 --> 00:57:40,589
The neighbors are
serving him a light lunch.

909
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:41,954
Hello, John.

910
00:57:44,292 --> 00:57:45,330
Hello.

911
00:57:46,218 --> 00:57:48,535
Mr. Mayor, if you don't mind,
we'd like to talk to him alone.

912
00:57:48,705 --> 00:57:50,589
Certainly.
Everybody clear out!

913
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:53,149
Everybody, quickly now.
Come on.

914
00:57:56,009 --> 00:57:57,526
Come on.

915
00:57:57,694 --> 00:57:59,931
That's right. Come on.

916
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:03,912
Don't argue with me here.
Wait till we get home.

917
00:58:04,074 --> 00:58:07,315
You can't push me around,
even though I am your wife!

918
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:10,372
Mr. Norton, you got a nerve
having these people hold us here.

919
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,663
Nobody's holding you here.

920
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,791
- It's only natural you...
- In that case, let's get going.

921
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,521
Incidentally, my name isn't Doe.
It's Willoughby.

922
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:23,049
Look, John.
Something important's happened.

923
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:26,376
They're forming John Doe Clubs.
We know of 8 and they say...

924
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,188
John Doe Clubs? What for?

925
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,394
To carry out the principles
in your radio speech.

926
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,244
I don't care, I'm on my way
and I don't like being stopped.

927
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,247
You don't how big this is.

928
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:40,182
You should see the thousands
of telegrams about you.

929
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:43,110
Look, it started as
a circulation stunt, didn't it?

930
00:58:43,278 --> 00:58:45,846
You got your circulation.
Why don't you let me alone?

931
00:58:46,006 --> 00:58:48,448
It started as a circulation stunt
but it isn't anymore.

932
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:51,856
Mr. Norton wants to back it,
sponsor clubs all over the country.

933
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:54,593
He wants to send you
on a lecture tour.

934
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:55,873
Me?

935
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:58,640
Certainly. With you ability
to influence people,

936
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:01,045
it might grow into
a glorious movement.

937
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:03,132
Let's get something straight.

938
00:59:04,224 --> 00:59:05,262
I don't want any part of this.

939
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:09,114
If you think I'm
lecturing people, you're crazy.

940
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,763
Baseball's my racket
and I'm sticking to it.

941
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,334
Colonel, let's get out of here.

942
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:15,409
John.

943
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,942
Please, I just
got rid of one crowd.

944
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:20,994
Please, Mr. Mayor,
tell him the John Doe Club

945
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,640
wants to talk to him.

946
00:59:22,803 --> 00:59:24,366
Let them in, Mr. Mayor.

947
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:27,536
Okay, but remember your manners.
No stampeding.

948
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:30,700
Walk slow, like you do when
you come to pay your taxes.

949
00:59:38,332 --> 00:59:39,689
All right.
Give me a chance.

950
00:59:39,856 --> 00:59:40,929
Come right in.

951
00:59:43,468 --> 00:59:45,670
My name's Bert Hansen, Mr. Doe.

952
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:48,357
I'm head soda-jerker
at Schwabacher's drugstore.

953
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,283
Well, sir...

954
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:53,018
me and my wife,
we heard your broadcast

955
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:56,146
and we got quite a bang out of it.
Especially my wife.

956
00:59:56,308 --> 00:59:59,115
Kept me up half the night saying:
"That man's right, honey.

957
00:59:59,277 --> 01:00:02,439
Trouble is, nobody gives a hoot
about his neighbor.

958
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:05,370
That's why everybody in town is
sore and cranky with each other."

959
01:00:05,578 --> 01:00:08,420
I said: "That's fine,
but how's a guy

960
01:00:08,587 --> 01:00:10,949
gonna go around lovin'
the kind of neighbors we got?"

961
01:00:11,115 --> 01:00:12,758
Old Sourpuss, for instance.

962
01:00:13,562 --> 01:00:17,363
Sourpuss Smithers is a guy,
lives alone next door to us.

963
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:20,457
He's a cranky old man who runs
the second hand furniture store.

964
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,908
We haven't
spoken to him for years.

965
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:26,839
I figured he was an ornery
old gent who hated the world

966
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:29,847
'cause was always slamming
his garage door

967
01:00:30,015 --> 01:00:33,302
and played his radio so loud
it kept half the neighbors up.

968
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:38,191
Anyway, the next morning
I'm out watering the lawn

969
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:39,639
and there's old Sourpuss,

970
01:00:39,805 --> 01:00:42,534
straightening out
a dent in his fender.

971
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:46,259
My wife yells to me
out the window:

972
01:00:46,427 --> 01:00:48,583
"Go on, speak to him, Bert."

973
01:00:48,874 --> 01:00:52,640
I figured I can't lose anything,
so I yelled over to him:

974
01:00:52,807 --> 01:00:56,732
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers."
He went on pounding his fender.

975
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,459
Was I burned! I turned round
to my wife and she said:

976
01:01:01,313 --> 01:01:03,882
"Louder, he didn't hear you."

977
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:06,971
So in a voice you could've
heard in the next county I said:

978
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:08,890
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"

979
01:01:11,105 --> 01:01:13,911
Well, you could have
knocked me over with a feather.

980
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:17,156
Old Sourpuss turned around,
surprised like,

981
01:01:17,324 --> 01:01:18,681
put on a big smile,

982
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,569
came over, took my hand
like an old lodge brother and said:

983
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,384
"Good morning, Hansen,

984
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,233
I've been wanting to talk for years
only I thought you didn't like me."

985
01:01:28,399 --> 01:01:31,080
Then he started chatting away
like a happy little kid.

986
01:01:31,248 --> 01:01:33,165
Got so excited his eyes...

987
01:01:33,736 --> 01:01:37,376
Well, before we got through
I found out that Smithers

988
01:01:37,549 --> 01:01:41,188
is a swell egg only he's pretty
deaf which accounts for the noises.

989
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,680
He says it's a shame how little
we know about our neighbors.

990
01:01:44,851 --> 01:01:46,974
Then he got an idea.
He say: "How's about...

991
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:49,100
inviting everybody some place
where we can all

992
01:01:49,265 --> 01:01:52,073
get together and
know each other a little better.

993
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:54,433
I feel so good, I'm up for it.

994
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:57,409
So Smithers goes
around the neighborhood

995
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,888
inviting everybody
to a meeting at the schoolhouse.

996
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:02,021
And I tell everybody
that comes into the store,

997
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,388
including my boss.

998
01:02:04,753 --> 01:02:07,116
- I'm talking too much.
- No, you're not.

999
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:08,955
Come on.

1000
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:12,490
Well I'll be doggone if
forty people don't show up.

1001
01:02:12,659 --> 01:02:15,021
Course, none of us
knew what to do,

1002
01:02:15,186 --> 01:02:17,833
but we got a kick out of
how glad everybody was

1003
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,832
just to say hello to one another.

1004
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,240
Tell him about making
Sourpuss chairman, honey.

1005
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,692
Oh yeah, we made
Sourpuss chairman

1006
01:02:24,857 --> 01:02:26,899
and decided to call ourselves
the John Doe Club.

1007
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:29,825
Incidentally, this is my wife.
Come here, honey.

1008
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:32,198
This is my wife, Mr. Doe.

1009
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,798
How do you do, Mr. Doe?

1010
01:02:33,965 --> 01:02:36,808
- Sourpuss is here, too.
- Oh, is he?

1011
01:02:39,102 --> 01:02:42,503
This is Sourpuss. Excuse me.
Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.

1012
01:02:42,673 --> 01:02:45,401
If you didn't call me Sourpuss,
it wouldn't feel natural.

1013
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:48,520
Well, I guess...

1014
01:02:48,692 --> 01:02:52,140
everybody in the neighborhood
came except the Delaneys.

1015
01:02:52,304 --> 01:02:55,830
They live in a big house
with an iron fence around it

1016
01:02:55,995 --> 01:02:58,118
and they always keep
their blinds drawn.

1017
01:02:58,283 --> 01:03:02,128
We figured he was
an old miser that sat back

1018
01:03:02,536 --> 01:03:05,183
counting his money,
so why bother inviting him?

1019
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:07,627
Until Grimes the milkman said:

1020
01:03:07,793 --> 01:03:09,629
"You got the Delaneys all wrong."

1021
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:15,286
Then he tells us they
cancelled their milk last week,

1022
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:17,659
and he found
a note on the bottle,

1023
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:20,791
got curious
and peeked under the blinds

1024
01:03:20,954 --> 01:03:22,631
and found the house was empty.

1025
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,275
"If you ask me", he says,
" they're starving."

1026
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:29,008
Old man Delaney's been bringing
his furniture to me at night,

1027
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,142
one piece at a time and selling it.

1028
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:34,992
A half a dozen of us
went over there to fetch him

1029
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:36,722
and we brought him to the meeting.

1030
01:03:37,044 --> 01:03:40,366
Everybody shook hands
and made a fuss over them.

1031
01:03:40,537 --> 01:03:42,054
Well, finally...

1032
01:03:42,462 --> 01:03:45,269
Mr. And Mrs. Delaney
sat right down and cried.

1033
01:03:45,712 --> 01:03:47,869
Then we started to find out
about a lot of other people.

1034
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,281
- Sure, Grubbel, for instance.
- Grubbel's here.

1035
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,167
- See?
- Yeah, that's him.

1036
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:56,502
Of course,
you don't know Grubbel, but...

1037
01:03:56,747 --> 01:03:59,143
he's the man everybody figured

1038
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:01,917
was the worst no-account
in the neighborhood

1039
01:04:02,123 --> 01:04:03,882
because he lived like a hermit.

1040
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,967
Nobody had anything to do with him

1041
01:04:06,137 --> 01:04:09,183
until Murphy the postman
told us the truth.

1042
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,588
Grubbel, he says,
lives out of garbage cans

1043
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:16,763
because he won't take charity.
It'd ruin his self respect.

1044
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:19,494
Just like you said
on the radio, Mr. Doe.

1045
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,667
A dozen families got together
and gave Grubbel a job

1046
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:24,792
watering their lawns.

1047
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:27,113
Then we found jobs
for six other people

1048
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:29,360
and they've all gone off relief.

1049
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,808
And my boss, Mr. Schwabacher,

1050
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,972
made a job in his warehouse
for old man Delaney.

1051
01:04:33,143 --> 01:04:35,869
- And he gave you a 5 dollar raise.
- Yeah. Isn't that swell?

1052
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:39,476
Why, Bert...

1053
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:43,614
I feel slighted.
Nobody asked me to join.

1054
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:47,943
Sorry, Mayor, we voted
no politician could join.

1055
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:50,231
Just John Does of the neighborhood.

1056
01:04:50,396 --> 01:04:52,358
You know how politicians are.

1057
01:04:56,174 --> 01:05:00,021
The reason we wanted to
tell you this, Mr. Doe,

1058
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,314
was to give you an idea
of what you started.

1059
01:05:03,678 --> 01:05:05,195
From where I'm sitting,

1060
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:08,334
I don't see any sense in
you jumping off any building.

1061
01:05:08,694 --> 01:05:10,131
No!

1062
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:12,740
Thank you for listening.

1063
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,267
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1064
01:05:16,398 --> 01:05:18,075
You're a wonderful man.

1065
01:05:18,244 --> 01:05:21,725
It strikes me you'd be useful
walking around for a while.

1066
01:05:22,617 --> 01:05:24,214
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1067
01:05:32,289 --> 01:05:34,605
I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe.

1068
01:05:34,777 --> 01:05:37,138
God bless you, my boy.

1069
01:06:11,212 --> 01:06:13,014
I'm all mixed up.

1070
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,221
I don't get it.

1071
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,242
All those swell people think
I'm gonna jump off a building.

1072
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:25,246
I never had any such idea.

1073
01:06:27,262 --> 01:06:28,380
Gosh!

1074
01:06:28,947 --> 01:06:32,633
A fella would have to be
a fine example to tell others...

1075
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:36,164
What happened the other night
was on account of Miss Mitchell.

1076
01:06:36,331 --> 01:06:37,654
She wrote the stuff.

1077
01:06:37,815 --> 01:06:40,211
Don't you see what a
wonderful thing this can be?

1078
01:06:40,383 --> 01:06:42,301
- But we need you, John.
- You're hooked.

1079
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:45,710
I can see that. They got you.
Well, I'm through.

1080
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:51,655
3 years I been trying to get you
up to the Columbia River country.

1081
01:06:51,819 --> 01:06:55,665
First it was your glass arm,
then the radio, now the Clubs.

1082
01:06:55,832 --> 01:06:57,394
I ain't waiting another minute.

1083
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:01,802
Gangway, you Heelots!

1084
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:05,173
Colonel, wait a minute.

1085
01:07:06,425 --> 01:07:07,383
Hey, Colonel!

1086
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:09,991
I want you to go with
John Doe and Miss Mitchell

1087
01:07:10,157 --> 01:07:11,800
and handle press and radio.

1088
01:07:11,963 --> 01:07:13,640
- Me?
- Yes, I won't take any chances.

1089
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:14,927
- And Johnson.
- Yes, D.B.?

1090
01:07:15,092 --> 01:07:17,409
Your crew will mop up,
follow John Doe into every town,

1091
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:21,061
see the clubs are organized
and charters issued.

1092
01:07:21,232 --> 01:07:22,876
There are 8 flags there now.

1093
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:25,800
I want to see that map covered
before we get through.

1094
01:08:32,096 --> 01:08:35,576
This has grown like wildfire.
I'd understand demands,

1095
01:08:35,747 --> 01:08:37,025
but the John Does ask for nothing.

1096
01:08:38,717 --> 01:08:41,363
People are going off relief.
It keeps up, I'm out of a job.

1097
01:08:41,525 --> 01:08:44,001
When John Doe gets strong enough,
we'll find out what he wants.

1098
01:08:44,173 --> 01:08:46,537
Thirty every Thursday,
sixty at sixty!

1099
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:48,379
Who knows what?

1100
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:51,674
Sorry, boss, they won't let anybody
talk politics with him. It's crazy.

1101
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,763
We've got to get to them.

1102
01:08:53,925 --> 01:08:56,321
They represent millions of voters.

1103
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:08,240
Ladies and gentlemen,
this has been a prairie fire.

1104
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:10,806
We've got so many applications
for John Doe charters

1105
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:12,461
we can't take care of them.

1106
01:09:12,664 --> 01:09:14,820
I'd hate to have
that many pins stuck in me.

1107
01:09:15,271 --> 01:09:18,798
This John Doe convention is
going to put our city on the map.

1108
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:23,251
2,400 John Doe Clubs
are sending delegates. Imagine!

1109
01:09:23,418 --> 01:09:26,738
Mr. Mayor, you will be the host.
Decorate the city, parades...

1110
01:09:26,908 --> 01:09:29,225
and a reception for John Doe
when he gets home.

1111
01:09:29,396 --> 01:09:30,800
And don't wear your high hat.

1112
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:32,959
- No high hat?
- No high hat.

1113
01:09:33,128 --> 01:09:35,569
And Connell, I want a
John Doe edition every day

1114
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:37,699
until the convention is over.

1115
01:09:37,864 --> 01:09:39,906
And now please step into
the outer office

1116
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:43,517
and look your prettiest
for the photographers.

1117
01:09:43,682 --> 01:09:45,838
Don't worry, D.B.,
everything'll be taken care of.

1118
01:09:46,008 --> 01:09:47,526
Isn't it all too wonderful?

1119
01:09:50,302 --> 01:09:52,220
Mr. Mayor,
step down in front, please.

1120
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:53,622
You ladies get close to him.

1121
01:09:54,154 --> 01:09:56,277
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

1122
01:09:56,523 --> 01:09:58,918
I'm meant to know my way around.

1123
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:01,453
This John Doe movement's
cost you a fortune.

1124
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:03,501
The convention will cost plenty.

1125
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:04,656
Well?

1126
01:10:04,908 --> 01:10:08,435
I'm stuck with 2 and 2
and I can't make 4 out of it.

1127
01:10:08,801 --> 01:10:09,999
Where do you come in?

1128
01:10:13,575 --> 01:10:15,378
I have the satisfaction of knowing

1129
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:18,018
my money has been spent
for a worthy cause.

1130
01:10:18,873 --> 01:10:21,234
I see. I better stick to
running the paper, huh?

1131
01:10:21,922 --> 01:10:23,440
I think you better had.

1132
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,457
Connell,

1133
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,181
I'd like to have
the John Doe contract,

1134
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:34,272
receipts for money we advanced
for Miss Mitchell's letter

1135
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:36,324
for which I gave her 1,000.

1136
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,527
Yes, sure.

1137
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:42,221
We leave for the airport
in half an hour.

1138
01:10:42,387 --> 01:10:44,429
Is that Johnny boy's room?
Better hustle him up.

1139
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:46,396
He'll be ready. He's packing.

1140
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,482
- See his photo on the cover of Time?
- Yeah.

1141
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:51,134
I gotta give you credit, Annie.

1142
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:53,612
I've handled many
big promotions in my time,

1143
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:56,258
from the World's Fair
to a Channel swimmer,

1144
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,633
but this has got me spinning.

1145
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:01,637
And now,
a John Doe convention.

1146
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:07,496
If you could get him to jump
off City Hall on Christmas Eve,

1147
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:10,391
I'd guarantee you
half a million people there.

1148
01:11:10,555 --> 01:11:12,039
- Charlie?
- Hmm?

1149
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,433
What do you make of him?

1150
01:11:14,087 --> 01:11:15,239
Johnny boy?

1151
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:19,858
I don't know what angle you want
but I'll give it to you quick.

1152
01:11:20,226 --> 01:11:23,546
One, he's got great yokel appeal,
but he's a nice guy.

1153
01:11:23,837 --> 01:11:26,918
Two, he's beginning to believe
he wrote that suicide letter

1154
01:11:27,087 --> 01:11:28,206
that you made up.

1155
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:31,498
Three, he thinks you're
Joan of Arc or something.

1156
01:11:31,663 --> 01:11:32,700
I know.

1157
01:11:32,866 --> 01:11:34,863
Four, well...

1158
01:11:35,033 --> 01:11:37,430
you know what number four is.
He's nuts about you.

1159
01:11:37,602 --> 01:11:39,403
It's runnin' out of his ears.

1160
01:11:39,687 --> 01:11:42,848
You left out five.
We're all heels, me especially.

1161
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:44,331
Holy smoke.

1162
01:11:45,586 --> 01:11:46,579
Come in.

1163
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:53,526
I'm all packed.

1164
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:55,528
Good, I'll get Beany boy.

1165
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:58,024
Okay, Charlie boy.

1166
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:11,667
Can I help you pack?

1167
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:13,748
No, thank you.

1168
01:12:23,184 --> 01:12:25,947
- Care if I sit down, out here?
- No.

1169
01:12:36,506 --> 01:12:37,704
You know,

1170
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:40,354
I had a crazy dream last night.

1171
01:12:42,686 --> 01:12:43,964
It was about you.

1172
01:12:45,174 --> 01:12:46,406
About me?

1173
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:48,495
Sure was crazy.

1174
01:12:49,106 --> 01:12:50,830
I dreamt I was your father.

1175
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,493
There was something I was
trying to stop you from doing.

1176
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:02,943
So, I got out of bed,

1177
01:13:03,752 --> 01:13:07,393
I walked right through the wall,
straight into your room.

1178
01:13:07,965 --> 01:13:09,643
You know how dreams are.

1179
01:13:10,173 --> 01:13:12,135
You were there in bed,

1180
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,862
but you were a girl, about 10...

1181
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,233
and very pretty, too.

1182
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,396
I shook you and...

1183
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:23,411
the moment you opened
your eyes, you hopped out of bed

1184
01:13:23,575 --> 01:13:25,858
and started running like
the devil. In your nightgown!

1185
01:13:26,023 --> 01:13:29,264
You ran out the window,
over the tops of buildings

1186
01:13:29,433 --> 01:13:31,955
and roofs for miles
and I was chasing you.

1187
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:36,616
All the time you were running,
you kept growing bigger

1188
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:38,420
and bigger and bigger.

1189
01:13:38,984 --> 01:13:42,384
Soon you were as big as you
are now, you know? Grown up?

1190
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:45,235
And all the time

1191
01:13:45,644 --> 01:13:48,452
I'm asking myself:
"What am I chasing her for?"

1192
01:13:49,015 --> 01:13:50,453
And I didn't know.

1193
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:53,382
Isn't that a hot one?

1194
01:13:55,035 --> 01:13:58,834
Anyway, you ran into some place
and I ran in after you.

1195
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:03,334
When I got there,
you were getting married.

1196
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,145
The nightgown had changed into

1197
01:14:08,317 --> 01:14:10,393
a beautiful wedding gown.

1198
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,087
You sure looked pretty, too.

1199
01:14:15,338 --> 01:14:18,420
Then I knew what I was
trying to stop you from doing.

1200
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:21,556
Dreams are crazy, aren't they?

1201
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:23,194
Well,

1202
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:26,611
like to know who you were marrying?

1203
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,151
A tall handsome Ubangi,
I suppose.

1204
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:36,120
Not that bad. It was the fella
that sends you flowers every day.

1205
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:39,007
What's his name?
Mr. Norton's nephew?

1206
01:14:40,137 --> 01:14:42,054
- Ted Sheldon.
- Yeah, that's the one.

1207
01:14:43,587 --> 01:14:45,424
But here's the funniest part.

1208
01:14:46,075 --> 01:14:48,837
I was the fella there,
doing the marrying.

1209
01:14:49,004 --> 01:14:51,127
- Justice of the Peace or something.
- You were?

1210
01:14:51,372 --> 01:14:52,810
I thought you were chasing me.

1211
01:14:52,977 --> 01:14:55,624
Yes, I was your father then,

1212
01:14:56,589 --> 01:14:58,904
but the real me,
John Doe, that is...

1213
01:14:59,076 --> 01:15:03,001
Long John Willoughby,
was the fella with a book.

1214
01:15:04,012 --> 01:15:05,974
- You know what I mean?
- I guess so.

1215
01:15:06,139 --> 01:15:07,371
Then what happened?

1216
01:15:08,144 --> 01:15:12,116
Well, I took you across my knee
and started spankin' ya.

1217
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,197
That is, I didn't do it...

1218
01:15:14,365 --> 01:15:17,891
I mean I did do it.
See, I was your father then.

1219
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:20,980
I had you across my knee
and I said:

1220
01:15:21,548 --> 01:15:22,265
"Annie,

1221
01:15:23,714 --> 01:15:25,837
I won't allow you
to marry a man

1222
01:15:26,162 --> 01:15:27,565
that's just rich

1223
01:15:27,727 --> 01:15:30,614
or that has his secretary
send you flowers.

1224
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:34,698
The man you marry
has got to swim rivers for you,

1225
01:15:35,191 --> 01:15:37,918
climb mountains for you,
slay dragons for you.

1226
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,800
He's got to perform
wonderful deeds for you!

1227
01:15:42,253 --> 01:15:45,653
All the time, the guy
up there with the book, me,

1228
01:15:45,864 --> 01:15:47,381
stood there noddin' his head

1229
01:15:47,871 --> 01:15:50,838
and he said:
"Go to it, whack her for me.

1230
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:53,282
That's the way I feel too."

1231
01:15:53,769 --> 01:15:56,691
He says: "Come down
and whack her yourself."

1232
01:15:57,059 --> 01:15:59,947
So I came down
and whacked you a good one.

1233
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,791
See? He whacked and I whacked.

1234
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,114
We both started whacking you...

1235
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:08,645
If you're through whacking her,
let's get going.

1236
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:09,770
Okay, right in here.

1237
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:13,629
You go out the side entrance.
Autograph seekers out front.

1238
01:16:14,233 --> 01:16:16,801
We'll be down
with the bags in a minute.

1239
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:20,693
Come on, don't make
a Government project out of this.

1240
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:24,697
Hi, Beany.

1241
01:16:25,228 --> 01:16:27,955
- When's our plane take off?
- Couple of minutes.

1242
01:16:29,241 --> 01:16:31,717
How many people
have we talked to already,

1243
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,533
outside the radio, I mean?

1244
01:16:33,694 --> 01:16:35,931
I don't know. About 300,000.

1245
01:16:36,744 --> 01:16:37,976
300,000.

1246
01:16:39,434 --> 01:16:41,111
What makes them do it, Ann?

1247
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,803
What makes them come and listen

1248
01:16:44,409 --> 01:16:47,375
and get up John Doe Clubs?

1249
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:50,100
I've been trying to figure it out.

1250
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:51,225
Look, John...

1251
01:16:51,391 --> 01:16:54,791
we're handing them platitudes
they've heard a million times.

1252
01:16:54,961 --> 01:16:56,879
Love thy neighbor,
clouds have silver linings,

1253
01:16:57,049 --> 01:17:00,530
- turn the other cheek. It's just...
- I heard 'em a million times,

1254
01:17:02,225 --> 01:17:03,423
but maybe they're like me,

1255
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:06,679
just beginning to get an idea

1256
01:17:06,839 --> 01:17:08,437
what those things mean.

1257
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:11,691
I never really thought
about the people before.

1258
01:17:11,855 --> 01:17:14,172
They were just somebody
to fill up the bleachers.

1259
01:17:14,784 --> 01:17:16,987
Only time I worried about them

1260
01:17:17,313 --> 01:17:19,629
was when they didn't see me pitch.

1261
01:17:21,285 --> 01:17:22,277
You know,

1262
01:17:22,649 --> 01:17:25,331
lately I've been watching them
when I talk to them.

1263
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:28,704
I see something in their faces.

1264
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,308
I could feel that...

1265
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,848
they were hungry for something.

1266
01:17:36,173 --> 01:17:37,370
You know what I mean?

1267
01:17:37,697 --> 01:17:39,533
Maybe that's why they came.

1268
01:17:40,064 --> 01:17:42,221
Maybe they're lonely and...

1269
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:44,434
wanted somebody to say hello to.

1270
01:17:45,963 --> 01:17:47,525
I know how they feel.

1271
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:52,256
I've been lonely and hungry
for something all my life.

1272
01:17:58,523 --> 01:18:00,200
All aboard, folks.

1273
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:03,773
- We'll have the city behind us.
- Yeah, that's true.

1274
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,068
- Somebody else sitting here?
- No, that's your seat.

1275
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:09,074
And this is your coat.

1276
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:12,484
- Mine?
- A little token of appreciation.

1277
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:18,936
It's beautiful, D.B.

1278
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,398
- I don't quite know what to say.
- Say nothing, just sit down.

1279
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,933
Go ahead, open it.

1280
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:39,160
It's lovely.

1281
01:18:39,572 --> 01:18:40,850
And a new contract goes with it.

1282
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,143
Well, spring it.

1283
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:49,838
Something's on your mind.

1284
01:18:50,486 --> 01:18:51,924
Must be stupendous.

1285
01:18:52,734 --> 01:18:56,100
That's what I like about her.
Right to the point.

1286
01:18:58,672 --> 01:19:01,275
Practical Annie, here it is.

1287
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:04,329
Tomorrow night,
before a crowd of 15,000,

1288
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,291
and over a nationwide
radio hook-up, John Doe

1289
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:10,787
will announce the formation
of a third party.

1290
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:12,669
A third party?

1291
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:15,034
Yes, the John Doe Party,

1292
01:19:15,204 --> 01:19:16,962
devoted entirely to
the interests of

1293
01:19:17,131 --> 01:19:19,811
John Does all over the country.

1294
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,896
Which practically means...

1295
01:19:23,109 --> 01:19:24,867
90o/o of the voters.

1296
01:19:25,236 --> 01:19:27,997
He'll also announce this party's

1297
01:19:28,165 --> 01:19:30,607
candidate for the presidency.

1298
01:19:31,175 --> 01:19:34,142
A man who
he personally recommends.

1299
01:19:34,304 --> 01:19:35,502
A great humanitarian.

1300
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:37,586
The best friend
the John Does have.

1301
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,723
Mr. D.B. Norton.

1302
01:19:41,086 --> 01:19:42,045
Yes.

1303
01:19:48,389 --> 01:19:49,587
Wow!

1304
01:20:15,596 --> 01:20:18,071
The opening of the convention
is only hours off.

1305
01:20:18,243 --> 01:20:20,639
The delegates are pouring into
the ball park with lunch baskets,

1306
01:20:20,811 --> 01:20:23,618
banners and petitions
asking John Doe

1307
01:20:23,781 --> 01:20:25,104
not to jump off any roof.

1308
01:20:25,265 --> 01:20:28,347
No matter how you look at it,
it's still a phenomenal movement.

1309
01:20:28,636 --> 01:20:32,323
These John Does or 'hoy polloi',
as you've heard people call them,

1310
01:20:32,488 --> 01:20:35,295
have been laughed at
and ridiculed.

1311
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:38,379
But here they are gay and happy,
having traveled 1,000s of miles,

1312
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,594
their expenses paid
by their neighbors to come

1313
01:20:41,757 --> 01:20:44,439
to pay homage to their hero.

1314
01:20:44,726 --> 01:20:47,968
In these days of wars
and bombings, it's a hopeful sign

1315
01:20:48,138 --> 01:20:50,740
that a simple idea like this
can sweep the country.

1316
01:20:50,906 --> 01:20:54,387
An idea based on friendliness,
on giving and not taking,

1317
01:20:54,557 --> 01:20:57,365
on helping your neighbor
and asking nothing in return.

1318
01:20:57,527 --> 01:21:01,009
If this can happen,
don't let your grumbling friends

1319
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:04,100
tell you that
humanity is falling apart.

1320
01:21:04,269 --> 01:21:07,828
This is John B. Hughes
returning you to our main studio

1321
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,083
until 9 o'clock when
the convention officially opens.

1322
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,940
John, come in.

1323
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:17,143
Say, I'm kind of...

1324
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,428
It's raining out a little.

1325
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:20,749
That's all right.

1326
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:22,838
Good to see you. Sit down.

1327
01:21:23,369 --> 01:21:24,328
Thanks.

1328
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:40,893
It's for Ann.

1329
01:21:41,225 --> 01:21:44,466
- How nice. Thank you very much.
- Flowers.

1330
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,804
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.

1331
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:49,608
She isn't?

1332
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,009
She just left. I'm surprised
you didn't run into her.

1333
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,857
She went to Mr. Norton's house.

1334
01:21:57,235 --> 01:21:59,598
Is it important?

1335
01:22:00,205 --> 01:22:02,602
Yeah. Well, no.
It'll wait.

1336
01:22:04,137 --> 01:22:07,058
He's a nice man, isn't he?
Mr. Norton, I mean.

1337
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:09,703
He's done a lot for the...

1338
01:22:16,897 --> 01:22:19,099
Say, my coat's pretty wet.

1339
01:22:19,746 --> 01:22:21,630
I might have wet the couch.

1340
01:22:27,731 --> 01:22:29,854
I'll see her at the convention.

1341
01:22:30,019 --> 01:22:32,176
Yes, I'll see she gets the flowers.

1342
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:34,227
Thanks.

1343
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:36,635
- Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
- Good night, John.

1344
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,219
Mrs. Mitchell...

1345
01:22:45,547 --> 01:22:48,709
I'm kind of glad Ann isn't here.

1346
01:22:50,002 --> 01:22:53,974
You see, I came here
hoping to see her alone

1347
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:57,217
and kind of hoping I wouldn't.

1348
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:01,112
I wanted to talk to her.

1349
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:05,929
It can wait, I guess.

1350
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:09,659
- Good night.
- Good night, John.

1351
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:16,203
Mrs. Mitchell,
have you ever been married?

1352
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,966
Well, sure you have.

1353
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,693
That's pretty silly.

1354
01:23:21,943 --> 01:23:24,306
Guess you think I'm batty.

1355
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:27,877
I guess I better be going.

1356
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:31,442
John...

1357
01:23:33,379 --> 01:23:36,460
my husband said:
"I love you. Will you marry me?"

1358
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:38,390
He did?

1359
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:41,479
- What happened?
- I married him.

1360
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:45,087
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1361
01:23:45,617 --> 01:23:47,055
It was easy as all that?

1362
01:23:48,867 --> 01:23:50,705
Yeah, but look Mr. Mitchell...

1363
01:23:51,836 --> 01:23:53,515
I love Ann,

1364
01:23:53,683 --> 01:23:56,730
and it's gonna be hard
for me to say it 'cause...

1365
01:23:57,214 --> 01:23:59,782
she's so wonderful

1366
01:24:00,183 --> 01:24:03,790
and the best I ever was
was a bush league pitcher.

1367
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:07,646
And I think
she's in love with another man,

1368
01:24:07,807 --> 01:24:11,048
the one she made up.
The real John Doe.

1369
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,582
That's pretty tough competition.

1370
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,393
I bet he'd know how to say it.

1371
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:20,878
But me, I get up to it
and around and in back of it,

1372
01:24:21,049 --> 01:24:24,690
but I never get right to it.
You know what I mean?

1373
01:24:25,503 --> 01:24:27,546
So the only chance I've got,

1374
01:24:27,711 --> 01:24:30,871
well, if somebody could
give her a warning.

1375
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:33,517
Prepare her for the shock?

1376
01:24:34,773 --> 01:24:36,005
You'd like me to do it?

1377
01:24:37,983 --> 01:24:41,782
Well, I was thinking,
sort of break the ice.

1378
01:24:43,882 --> 01:24:45,399
Of course I will, John.

1379
01:24:48,857 --> 01:24:50,135
Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.

1380
01:24:51,465 --> 01:24:52,983
Hey, you're okay.

1381
01:25:05,148 --> 01:25:08,115
The John Doe meeting will be
one of the biggest things ever.

1382
01:25:08,279 --> 01:25:11,086
They're coming from all over:
trains, boxcars, wagons.

1383
01:25:11,248 --> 01:25:12,525
Look out!

1384
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:15,055
- Hello, bodyguards. Had dinner?
- Not yet.

1385
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,103
- That's all right.
- No, go and have dinner.

1386
01:25:17,267 --> 01:25:18,590
Wait a minute, John.

1387
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,242
- Hello, Mr. Connell.
- How are you, John?

1388
01:25:25,814 --> 01:25:28,381
I want to have
a little talk with you.

1389
01:25:29,986 --> 01:25:32,873
What's the matter?
Are you falling?

1390
01:25:33,277 --> 01:25:35,240
- Hey, Boss.
- Oh, quiet, quiet.

1391
01:25:35,444 --> 01:25:39,336
Did you read the speech
you're going to make tonight?

1392
01:25:39,496 --> 01:25:42,019
No, I never read the speeches
before I make them.

1393
01:25:42,186 --> 01:25:43,703
I get more of a kick out of it.

1394
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:45,548
Exactly what I thought.

1395
01:25:45,796 --> 01:25:49,244
Beany, go to the office, tell Pop
to give you the speech.

1396
01:25:49,408 --> 01:25:52,889
Mr. Norton told me not to
leave him, even for a minute.

1397
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:55,787
Go on, go on. We'll be at
Jim's Bar, up the street.

1398
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:58,790
You're a nice guy, John.

1399
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:02,438
I like you. You're gentle.

1400
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:05,530
I always like gentle people.

1401
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,467
Me... I'm hard.

1402
01:26:08,468 --> 01:26:11,011
Hard and tough.

1403
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:13,220
I got no use for hard people.

1404
01:26:14,222 --> 01:26:16,229
Gotta be gentle to suit me.

1405
01:26:20,232 --> 01:26:22,740
Like you, for instance.

1406
01:26:29,245 --> 01:26:31,899
Yep, I'm hard.
But you want to know something?

1407
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,373
I've got a weakness.

1408
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:37,671
You'd never guess. Well, I have.

1409
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,839
Wanna know what it is?

1410
01:26:40,810 --> 01:26:42,934
"The Star Spangled Banner."

1411
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:46,744
Screwy, huh? Maybe it is.

1412
01:26:46,913 --> 01:26:50,397
Play it and I'm a sucker for it.

1413
01:26:51,451 --> 01:26:54,820
Always gets me right here.
You know what I mean?

1414
01:26:55,427 --> 01:26:57,425
Yeah, it gets me right back here.

1415
01:26:58,078 --> 01:26:59,516
Back there, huh?

1416
01:27:00,004 --> 01:27:02,814
Well, every man
to his own taste.

1417
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,147
You weren't old enough

1418
01:27:08,638 --> 01:27:11,402
for the world war.

1419
01:27:11,971 --> 01:27:13,203
No, of course not.

1420
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:15,943
You must have been just a kid.

1421
01:27:17,152 --> 01:27:18,224
I was.

1422
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,598
I was just ripe...

1423
01:27:22,572 --> 01:27:24,377
and raring to go.

1424
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:28,474
Know what my old man did
when I joined up?

1425
01:27:28,637 --> 01:27:30,074
He joined up too.

1426
01:27:30,563 --> 01:27:32,048
Got to be a sergeant.

1427
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,532
We were in the same outfit.

1428
01:27:36,788 --> 01:27:38,112
Funny, huh?

1429
01:27:43,575 --> 01:27:45,459
He was killed, John.

1430
01:27:47,791 --> 01:27:49,023
I saw him get it.

1431
01:27:50,843 --> 01:27:54,452
I was right there and saw it
with my own eyes.

1432
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:02,572
I came out without a scratch.

1433
01:28:04,425 --> 01:28:06,788
That is, excepting my ulcers.

1434
01:28:12,048 --> 01:28:15,050
I should be drinking milk.
This stuff is poison.

1435
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:17,300
Hey, Jimmy!

1436
01:28:17,745 --> 01:28:19,869
- Yes, Mr. Connell?
- What do you say?

1437
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:21,072
All right.

1438
01:28:23,445 --> 01:28:25,566
I'm a sucker for this country.

1439
01:28:26,253 --> 01:28:30,145
For "The Star Spangled Banner"
and this country.

1440
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,543
I like what we got here.

1441
01:28:32,833 --> 01:28:34,237
I like it!

1442
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:38,682
A guy can say what he wants

1443
01:28:38,852 --> 01:28:41,773
and do what he wants without
getting a bayonet in his belly.

1444
01:28:41,943 --> 01:28:43,095
And that's all right.

1445
01:28:43,789 --> 01:28:45,351
- You betcha.
- Yeah.

1446
01:28:45,554 --> 01:28:48,954
And we don't anybody
changing that, do we?

1447
01:28:49,206 --> 01:28:50,963
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

1448
01:28:52,055 --> 01:28:54,530
When they do, I get mad,

1449
01:28:54,782 --> 01:28:57,464
I get boiling mad.

1450
01:28:58,074 --> 01:29:01,120
Right now, I'm sizzling.

1451
01:29:02,247 --> 01:29:05,773
I get mad for a lot of
other guys besides myself.

1452
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:09,782
I get mad for a guy
named Washington.

1453
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:12,754
And a guy named Jefferson

1454
01:29:13,241 --> 01:29:14,474
and Lincoln.

1455
01:29:15,407 --> 01:29:17,451
Lighthouses, John.

1456
01:29:18,297 --> 01:29:21,379
Lighthouses in a foggy world.

1457
01:29:23,312 --> 01:29:24,637
You know what I mean?

1458
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,555
Yeah, you bet.

1459
01:29:28,128 --> 01:29:29,360
Listen, pal.

1460
01:29:30,174 --> 01:29:33,382
This fifth column stuff
is pretty rotten, isn't it?

1461
01:29:33,986 --> 01:29:35,343
Yeah, it certainly is.

1462
01:29:35,872 --> 01:29:38,839
You'd feel like an awful sucker
marching in the middle of it,

1463
01:29:39,003 --> 01:29:40,234
wouldn't you?

1464
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:43,211
You! You wouldn't know

1465
01:29:43,377 --> 01:29:45,418
because you're gentle.

1466
01:29:45,983 --> 01:29:47,626
But that's what you're doing.

1467
01:29:48,553 --> 01:29:51,474
You're mixed up
with a skunk, my boy.

1468
01:29:52,284 --> 01:29:55,651
A no-good, dangerous skunk.

1469
01:29:58,302 --> 01:30:00,539
You're not talking about Norton?

1470
01:30:01,032 --> 01:30:04,192
I'm not talking about
his grandfather's pet poodle.

1471
01:30:08,012 --> 01:30:09,691
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell.

1472
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:12,180
He's been marvelous
about the John Doe Clubs.

1473
01:30:12,346 --> 01:30:13,385
Yeah.

1474
01:30:14,554 --> 01:30:17,875
You're sold on this John Doe idea?

1475
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:21,046
- Sure.
- Yeah, I don't blame you.

1476
01:30:21,255 --> 01:30:22,979
It's a beautiful miracle,

1477
01:30:23,342 --> 01:30:25,498
a miracle that can only happen

1478
01:30:25,669 --> 01:30:28,237
right here in
the good old U.S.A,

1479
01:30:28,397 --> 01:30:31,079
and I think it's terrific.
What do you think of that?

1480
01:30:31,366 --> 01:30:33,444
Me, hard-boiled Connell,

1481
01:30:33,614 --> 01:30:36,136
and I think it's plenty terrific.

1482
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:39,384
Alright. Now suppose
an unmentionable worm,

1483
01:30:39,552 --> 01:30:40,910
who's initials

1484
01:30:41,077 --> 01:30:43,394
are D.B.,

1485
01:30:43,846 --> 01:30:45,889
was trying to use that to

1486
01:30:46,053 --> 01:30:47,936
shove his way into the White House.

1487
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:50,823
So he could put the screws on.

1488
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:55,355
So he could turn out
the lights in the lighthouses.

1489
01:30:58,613 --> 01:31:00,176
What would you say about that?

1490
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:03,343
Nobody's gonna do that.

1491
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:06,873
They can't use
the John Doe Clubs for politics.

1492
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,240
- That's the main idea.
- Is that so?

1493
01:31:10,088 --> 01:31:13,296
Then what's a big political boss
like Hammett doing in town?

1494
01:31:13,459 --> 01:31:15,616
And a labor leader like Bennett.
And lots of other big shots

1495
01:31:15,787 --> 01:31:18,549
that are up at
D.B.'s house right now.

1496
01:31:18,797 --> 01:31:21,192
Wolves, John. Wolves.

1497
01:31:21,604 --> 01:31:24,333
Waiting to
cut up the John Does.

1498
01:31:25,538 --> 01:31:28,538
Wait till you get a gander
at your speech tonight.

1499
01:31:28,707 --> 01:31:31,596
You're all wet.
Miss Mitchell writes the speeches.

1500
01:31:31,756 --> 01:31:32,875
Nobody can make her write that.

1501
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:34,272
They can't?

1502
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:36,727
Who writes 'em, my aunt Emma?

1503
01:31:36,974 --> 01:31:38,856
I know she writes them

1504
01:31:39,021 --> 01:31:41,588
and gets a big bonus
for doing them, too.

1505
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,191
A mink coat and diamond bracelet.

1506
01:31:44,516 --> 01:31:45,841
Don't write 'em?

1507
01:31:46,404 --> 01:31:49,371
Why that gold-grabbing dame
would double cross her own mother

1508
01:31:49,534 --> 01:31:52,340
- for a handful of Chinese Yams.
- Shut up!

1509
01:31:53,827 --> 01:31:55,264
If you weren't drunk, I'd...

1510
01:31:56,313 --> 01:31:57,467
Hey, Boss.

1511
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,884
Here's the speech, Boss.

1512
01:32:01,651 --> 01:32:04,618
Read it, and then start sockin'.

1513
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:08,551
Wait, Mr. Doe.

1514
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:11,598
Jimmy.

1515
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:14,486
- Yes, sir.
- Better bring me a glass of milk.

1516
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:18,339
I'm smoking too much.

1517
01:32:22,316 --> 01:32:24,759
Yes, Charlie. Everything all set?

1518
01:32:25,084 --> 01:32:27,208
Fine.
John Doe been take care of?

1519
01:32:27,533 --> 01:32:28,446
Good.

1520
01:32:28,977 --> 01:32:31,945
How many people
will be there? 15,000?

1521
01:32:32,509 --> 01:32:33,831
Oh my, that's fine.

1522
01:32:34,314 --> 01:32:37,155
Listen, Charlie. As soon as
John Doe stops talking about me

1523
01:32:37,322 --> 01:32:40,210
I want you to start
that demonstration, a big one.

1524
01:32:40,694 --> 01:32:42,737
Don't worry about that, D.B.
My boys are there.

1525
01:32:42,901 --> 01:32:44,098
They'll take care of it.

1526
01:32:44,264 --> 01:32:46,834
Yes, I'll be there
15 minutes after I get your call.

1527
01:32:48,599 --> 01:32:50,161
Why, Mr. Doe!

1528
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:53,041
- Where are they?
- In the dining room, sir.

1529
01:32:57,749 --> 01:33:00,992
Gentlemen, I think we're ready
to throw that big bombshell.

1530
01:33:01,161 --> 01:33:02,519
Yeah, it's about time.

1531
01:33:02,686 --> 01:33:05,127
A conservative estimate shows

1532
01:33:05,295 --> 01:33:08,424
we can count on between
10 and 20 million John Doe votes.

1533
01:33:08,588 --> 01:33:11,714
Add that to the labor vote
Mr. Bennett will throw in.

1534
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:14,686
And the votes controlled by
Mr. Hammett and you gentlemen,

1535
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:16,686
and nothing can stop us.

1536
01:33:16,856 --> 01:33:18,500
As I said, I'm with you,

1537
01:33:18,703 --> 01:33:21,306
providing you can guarantee
the John Doe vote.

1538
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,280
- Don't worry about that.
- Count on me, on one condition.

1539
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:26,721
Little Bennett is taken care of.

1540
01:33:26,891 --> 01:33:29,368
Everybody will be taken care of.

1541
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:31,585
My agreement with you stands.

1542
01:33:31,869 --> 01:33:33,101
I'm with you, D.B.,

1543
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:36,002
but I still think it's
a daring thing we're attempting.

1544
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:38,286
Daring times, Mr. Barrington.

1545
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:42,217
We come to a new order of things.
Too much talk in this country.

1546
01:33:42,545 --> 01:33:43,951
Too many concessions made.

1547
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:46,314
What the American people need
is an iron hand.

1548
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:47,153
You're right, that's true.

1549
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:48,394
You're right, D.B.

1550
01:33:48,565 --> 01:33:49,765
Discipline!

1551
01:33:51,897 --> 01:33:54,982
And now may I offer
a toast to Miss Ann Mitchell,

1552
01:33:56,674 --> 01:33:59,837
the brilliant and beautiful lady
who's responsible for all this.

1553
01:34:00,087 --> 01:34:01,365
Miss Mitchell.

1554
01:34:02,174 --> 01:34:04,252
Mr. Norton, I'd like to talk
to you alone for a minute.

1555
01:34:05,143 --> 01:34:07,142
Miss Mitchell has
something to say to us.

1556
01:34:07,552 --> 01:34:09,229
That's fine. Speech!

1557
01:34:13,694 --> 01:34:14,812
Hello.

1558
01:34:22,806 --> 01:34:25,488
John, I'm glad to see you.
I was terribly worried.

1559
01:34:25,656 --> 01:34:26,853
Did you write this?

1560
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:31,150
Yes I did, John, but I had
no idea what was going on.

1561
01:34:31,677 --> 01:34:33,241
- You didn't?
- No.

1562
01:34:35,289 --> 01:34:37,173
Swell bracelet you're wearing.

1563
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:43,433
John, why aren't you
at the convention?

1564
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,419
Is there anything wrong?

1565
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:03,020
No, nothing's wrong.

1566
01:35:03,589 --> 01:35:04,866
Everything's fine.

1567
01:35:05,997 --> 01:35:08,314
So there's going to be
a new order of things, huh?

1568
01:35:08,565 --> 01:35:12,206
Everybody's gonna cut himself
a nice fat slice of the John Does?

1569
01:35:13,142 --> 01:35:15,265
You forgot one detail,
Mr. Big Shot.

1570
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:16,628
You forgot me,

1571
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,631
the prize stooge of the world.

1572
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:22,644
If you or anybody thinks
he's gonna use the John Doe Clubs

1573
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:25,258
for his own rotten purpose,
he'll do it over my dead body.

1574
01:35:25,747 --> 01:35:29,148
Hold on a minute, young man.
That's rather big talk.

1575
01:35:29,319 --> 01:35:31,921
I started the John Doe Clubs
with my money

1576
01:35:32,088 --> 01:35:34,611
and I'll decide whether or not
they're being properly used.

1577
01:35:34,777 --> 01:35:36,739
No, you won't.
You're through deciding anything.

1578
01:35:36,905 --> 01:35:39,381
What's more, I'm going
down to the convention

1579
01:35:39,554 --> 01:35:43,276
and tell those people what you
and your fine feathered friends

1580
01:35:43,448 --> 01:35:45,731
are cooking up for them.

1581
01:35:46,057 --> 01:35:48,455
I'm gonna say it
in my own words this time.

1582
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,558
He'll ruin us, D.B.!

1583
01:35:54,446 --> 01:35:56,204
Wait a minute, fella.

1584
01:35:56,372 --> 01:35:58,210
My uncle wants to talk to you.

1585
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,783
Listen to me, my son.

1586
01:35:59,944 --> 01:36:02,021
Before you
lose your head completely,

1587
01:36:02,192 --> 01:36:04,670
may I remind you that
I picked you up out of the gutter,

1588
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:07,001
and I can throw you
right back there again.

1589
01:36:07,491 --> 01:36:10,812
You've got a nerve
accusing people of things.

1590
01:36:10,983 --> 01:36:13,425
These men and I know what's best
for the John Does of America

1591
01:36:13,592 --> 01:36:15,555
regardless of what
tramps like you think.

1592
01:36:16,803 --> 01:36:19,851
Get off that righteous horse
and come to your senses.

1593
01:36:20,136 --> 01:36:23,024
You're the fake.
We believe in what we're doing.

1594
01:36:23,187 --> 01:36:26,394
You were paid your 30 pieces
of silver. Have you forgotten that?

1595
01:36:26,558 --> 01:36:27,711
Well, I haven't.

1596
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:30,406
You're a fake, John Doe,
and I can prove it.

1597
01:36:30,612 --> 01:36:34,138
You're the big hero that's
meant to jump off tall buildings.

1598
01:36:34,344 --> 01:36:37,667
Remember? What will your
precious John Does say

1599
01:36:37,836 --> 01:36:40,233
when they find out you never
had any intention of doing it?

1600
01:36:40,406 --> 01:36:42,324
That you were paid to say so?

1601
01:36:42,493 --> 01:36:44,536
You'd be run out of the country.

1602
01:36:44,902 --> 01:36:48,109
With the newspapers and radio
stations these gentlemen control,

1603
01:36:48,273 --> 01:36:50,843
we can kill the John Doe movement
deader than a doornail.

1604
01:36:51,003 --> 01:36:53,001
We'll do it the moment
you step out of line.

1605
01:36:54,815 --> 01:36:58,584
You want to go to the convention
and shoot your trap off,

1606
01:36:58,749 --> 01:37:00,108
go ahead and do it.

1607
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:10,184
You mean, you'd try to kill
the John Doe movement

1608
01:37:10,351 --> 01:37:12,588
if you can't use it?

1609
01:37:12,961 --> 01:37:15,082
Bet your bottom dollar.

1610
01:37:21,067 --> 01:37:23,431
That's certainly is a new low.

1611
01:37:24,962 --> 01:37:27,164
Guess I've seen everything now.

1612
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:32,100
You sit with your big cigars
and think of deliberately killing

1613
01:37:32,267 --> 01:37:35,429
an idea that's made millions
of people a bit happier.

1614
01:37:35,919 --> 01:37:39,642
An idea that's brought thousands
here from all over the country.

1615
01:37:39,814 --> 01:37:42,702
By bus, train, jalopy and foot

1616
01:37:42,865 --> 01:37:46,392
so they can pass on to each other
a little of their experiences.

1617
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:50,407
I'm just a mug and I know it,

1618
01:37:50,613 --> 01:37:52,654
but I'm beginning to
understand a lot of things.

1619
01:37:52,819 --> 01:37:54,657
Your types are
as old as history.

1620
01:37:54,826 --> 01:37:57,748
If you can't lay your
dirty fingers on a decent idea,

1621
01:37:57,917 --> 01:38:00,519
and squeeze it into your pocket,

1622
01:38:01,008 --> 01:38:03,530
like dogs, if you can't eat it,
you bury it.

1623
01:38:04,619 --> 01:38:07,189
This is the one worthwhile
thing that's come along.

1624
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:10,950
People finally find out
the guy next door isn't a bad egg.

1625
01:38:11,203 --> 01:38:12,161
That's simple, isn't it?

1626
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:14,644
Yet a thing like that
has got a chance of spreading

1627
01:38:14,815 --> 01:38:16,975
till it touches every
human being in the world,

1628
01:38:17,144 --> 01:38:19,106
and you talk about killing it.

1629
01:38:19,551 --> 01:38:21,836
Well, when this fire dies down,
what's going to be left?

1630
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,570
More misery, hunger and hate.

1631
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:27,208
And what's to prevent that
from starting all over again?

1632
01:38:27,379 --> 01:38:30,109
Nobody knows the answer to that
and certainly not you,

1633
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:32,472
with those slimy,
bollixed up theories you got.

1634
01:38:32,638 --> 01:38:36,007
The John Doe idea
may be the answer, the one thing

1635
01:38:36,171 --> 01:38:39,412
capable of saving this world,
and you sit on your fat hulks

1636
01:38:39,582 --> 01:38:41,704
and tell me you'll kill it
if you can't use it.

1637
01:38:41,870 --> 01:38:44,073
Well, go ahead and try.
You couldn't do it

1638
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:47,526
in a million years with all your
radio stations and your power

1639
01:38:47,811 --> 01:38:51,098
because it's bigger than
whether I'm a fake or your ambition

1640
01:38:51,262 --> 01:38:53,021
and bigger than all the bracelets
and fur coats in the world!

1641
01:38:53,188 --> 01:38:54,421
You bet it is, John.

1642
01:38:54,594 --> 01:38:57,117
That's exactly what
I'm going to tell those people.

1643
01:39:00,535 --> 01:39:03,698
You ungrateful rat!
My uncle's been too good to...

1644
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,184
He's getting away.

1645
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:07,837
John!

1646
01:39:08,001 --> 01:39:09,119
Get me the Bulletin.

1647
01:39:10,691 --> 01:39:11,682
John!

1648
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:13,854
I told you, D.B.,

1649
01:39:14,022 --> 01:39:15,506
you're playing with dynamite.

1650
01:39:16,994 --> 01:39:18,432
Don't let that girl get away.

1651
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,399
Before he gets through tonight,
he'll ruin us all.

1652
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:23,806
I'll stop him cold.
I've been ready for this.

1653
01:39:23,977 --> 01:39:25,210
John!

1654
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:27,266
John, please listen to me.

1655
01:39:27,429 --> 01:39:30,478
I can explain. I didn't know
what they were going to do.

1656
01:39:30,641 --> 01:39:32,158
Let me go with you.

1657
01:39:32,647 --> 01:39:33,800
John, please!

1658
01:39:33,972 --> 01:39:35,889
Go ahead, driver.
Ball park.

1659
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,707
Please let me go with you!
Please, John.

1660
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:40,593
Please, John.

1661
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:42,681
Mr. Norton wants to see you.

1662
01:39:43,204 --> 01:39:45,931
Listen to me, Mayor.
I want them both arrested.

1663
01:39:46,093 --> 01:39:48,571
Tell the police to pick up Connell.
I've got the girl here.

1664
01:39:48,744 --> 01:39:52,431
I don't care, charge them.
Keep them in jail overnight.

1665
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,362
Hello, Bulletin?
Put Buck Meyer on.

1666
01:40:45,863 --> 01:40:48,020
Three cheers for John Doe.

1667
01:41:40,697 --> 01:41:43,141
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- One moment, John.

1668
01:41:44,673 --> 01:41:46,673
We'll begin with a soft prayer.

1669
01:41:50,096 --> 01:41:51,454
Quiet, please.

1670
01:41:52,746 --> 01:41:54,472
Ladies and gentlemen,

1671
01:41:54,634 --> 01:41:57,559
a moment of silent prayer

1672
01:41:57,890 --> 01:42:00,974
for the John Does
all over the world,

1673
01:42:01,504 --> 01:42:05,433
many of whom
are homeless and hungry.

1674
01:42:06,362 --> 01:42:07,722
Rise, please.

1675
01:42:09,015 --> 01:42:10,338
Everybody rise.

1676
01:43:02,194 --> 01:43:05,919
Hundreds of news boys
are swarming in like locusts.

1677
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:07,815
They're yelling
"John Doe's a fake."

1678
01:43:20,912 --> 01:43:23,437
Federal investigation
urged by Chamber of Commerce.

1679
01:43:23,604 --> 01:43:26,892
- How could he be a fake?
- Must be some kind of a gag.

1680
01:43:27,057 --> 01:43:28,783
- A what?
- A gag!

1681
01:43:40,313 --> 01:43:41,798
Come on, step on it!

1682
01:43:43,526 --> 01:43:44,852
Step on it!

1683
01:43:45,013 --> 01:43:47,778
You all know you're places.
Wait for the signal.

1684
01:43:47,946 --> 01:43:50,228
- Will you autograph my balloon?
- Sure.

1685
01:43:59,954 --> 01:44:01,438
Ladies and gentlemen,

1686
01:44:02,405 --> 01:44:05,774
this is what I came down here
to tell you about.

1687
01:44:07,706 --> 01:44:10,356
Please, if you all just
be quiet for a few minutes,

1688
01:44:10,517 --> 01:44:12,322
I can explain this whole thing.

1689
01:44:14,174 --> 01:44:16,251
As you all know,
this paper is published

1690
01:44:16,421 --> 01:44:18,502
by a man by the name of
D.B. Norton...

1691
01:44:18,673 --> 01:44:19,952
Get back, you!

1692
01:44:20,961 --> 01:44:22,928
Everybody, wait a minute.

1693
01:44:24,415 --> 01:44:25,614
Ladies and gentlemen,

1694
01:44:27,909 --> 01:44:29,235
My name is D.B.Norton.

1695
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:31,040
You all know me.

1696
01:44:31,363 --> 01:44:33,968
I accuse this man
of being a faker.

1697
01:44:34,135 --> 01:44:37,025
We've been taken for suckers
and I'm the biggest of the lot!

1698
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:39,232
I spent a fortune backing this man

1699
01:44:39,397 --> 01:44:43,294
in what I believed was a sincere
and worthy cause, as you all did.

1700
01:44:44,659 --> 01:44:46,179
Now I find out it's
nothing but a cheap racket,

1701
01:44:46,587 --> 01:44:49,478
cooked up by him and two of
my employees for the purpose of

1702
01:44:49,641 --> 01:44:52,040
collecting dues from
John Does all over the country.

1703
01:44:52,211 --> 01:44:53,203
That's a lie!

1704
01:44:53,415 --> 01:44:55,859
It's not a lie! Nickel and dimes
to stuff in their pockets.

1705
01:44:56,025 --> 01:44:58,151
You can read about it
in the newspapers there.

1706
01:44:58,316 --> 01:45:00,681
That's a lie! Don't believe...

1707
01:45:00,847 --> 01:45:03,497
This man had no intention
of jumping off a building.

1708
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:06,057
He was paid to say so.
Do you deny that?

1709
01:45:06,227 --> 01:45:08,958
- That's got nothing to do with it.
- Were you paid or weren't you?

1710
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,399
Yes, I was paid, but...

1711
01:45:10,566 --> 01:45:12,645
And the suicide note.
You didn't write that either.

1712
01:45:12,815 --> 01:45:14,733
- What difference does that make?
- Did you write it?

1713
01:45:15,145 --> 01:45:17,430
- No, I didn't.
- You bet your life you didn't.

1714
01:45:17,594 --> 01:45:19,115
Look in your papers and find

1715
01:45:19,283 --> 01:45:22,847
Miss Mitchell's signed confession
that she wrote it.

1716
01:45:23,018 --> 01:45:24,936
I didn't write the letter...

1717
01:45:25,106 --> 01:45:27,632
Now you see, he admits it.
You're a fake, John Doe.

1718
01:45:27,918 --> 01:45:30,204
For what you did to these people,

1719
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:32,248
they ought to
run you out of the country.

1720
01:45:32,417 --> 01:45:34,256
And I hope they do it.

1721
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:45,020
Speak up, John. We believe you.

1722
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:46,711
Please listen, folks.

1723
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:49,403
Now that he's through
shooting off his face,

1724
01:45:49,567 --> 01:45:51,371
I got some things to tell you.

1725
01:45:51,816 --> 01:45:54,261
The rest of you get in and riot.
Break this crowd up.

1726
01:45:54,428 --> 01:45:56,267
I'm sorry folks,
we can't hear him anymore.

1727
01:45:56,438 --> 01:45:58,435
Something's up with the speakers.

1728
01:45:58,966 --> 01:46:00,371
John Doe's a fake!

1729
01:46:01,699 --> 01:46:03,217
Please. They can't hear me.

1730
01:46:05,475 --> 01:46:06,706
This thing's not working.

1731
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,642
Ladies and gentlemen...

1732
01:46:26,883 --> 01:46:29,486
This thing's bigger than
whether I'm a fake.

1733
01:46:31,382 --> 01:46:34,032
Bert, you believe me, don't ya?

1734
01:46:34,756 --> 01:46:36,640
Sure. I believe you.

1735
01:46:37,406 --> 01:46:41,416
Walking my legs off picking up
5,000 signatures for a phony.

1736
01:46:41,623 --> 01:46:43,349
There you are, Mr. Doe.

1737
01:46:43,512 --> 01:46:46,802
5,000 names asking you
not to jump off any roof.

1738
01:46:46,966 --> 01:46:49,284
Makes no difference, Bert.
The idea's still good.

1739
01:46:49,456 --> 01:46:52,221
- We don't have to give it up.
- Yeah, you can have it.

1740
01:46:55,803 --> 01:46:58,247
They're starting to throw things.
Somebody's going to get hurt.

1741
01:46:58,414 --> 01:47:00,413
I'm afraid it will be John Doe.

1742
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:01,907
Listen to that mob.

1743
01:47:04,799 --> 01:47:06,239
I've got to go to him.

1744
01:47:06,407 --> 01:47:09,892
- Sorry, lady. I can't let you out.
- Let me go!

1745
01:47:10,062 --> 01:47:13,991
Please. They're crucifying him.
I can help him!

1746
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:17,689
- We got orders to hold you.
- From who? It's a frame-up!

1747
01:47:17,854 --> 01:47:20,425
- Ann darling.
- Mother, they won't let me go.

1748
01:47:20,586 --> 01:47:22,229
They won't let me go.

1749
01:47:23,999 --> 01:47:25,198
Listen, folks.

1750
01:47:26,006 --> 01:47:27,927
You gotta listen to me!

1751
01:47:28,096 --> 01:47:31,465
Back to the jungle, you hobo.

1752
01:47:31,631 --> 01:47:32,625
Just another racket!

1753
01:47:33,158 --> 01:47:34,562
Stick to your clubs.

1754
01:47:34,764 --> 01:47:36,923
We've been fed baloney so long
we're getting used to it.

1755
01:47:46,372 --> 01:47:48,770
The idea is still good.

1756
01:47:50,147 --> 01:47:51,507
Believe me, folks.

1757
01:47:54,485 --> 01:47:57,375
John Does were
the hope of the world.

1758
01:48:34,411 --> 01:48:36,570
A friend got him out of the park.

1759
01:48:36,742 --> 01:48:38,306
Be a miracle if he's not hurt.

1760
01:48:38,628 --> 01:48:42,479
Ladies and gentlemen, looks like
the end of the John Doe movement.

1761
01:48:43,569 --> 01:48:47,418
Well, boys, chalk up
another one to the Pontius Pilates.

1762
01:48:54,935 --> 01:48:56,857
I should have been there.

1763
01:48:57,545 --> 01:48:59,145
I could have helped him.

1764
01:49:01,002 --> 01:49:02,887
He was so all alone.

1765
01:49:06,383 --> 01:49:09,273
We ought to be ashamed
of ourselves after tonight.

1766
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,764
We didn't give him a chance.

1767
01:49:22,731 --> 01:49:24,809
More coffee, Long John?

1768
01:49:25,785 --> 01:49:27,509
No thanks, Colonel.

1769
01:49:48,718 --> 01:49:50,477
- Fake!
- Racketeer!

1770
01:49:50,647 --> 01:49:52,566
- Liar!
- Cheat!

1771
01:49:52,735 --> 01:49:55,500
- Impostor!
- Why don't you jump?

1772
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:58,273
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1773
01:49:59,161 --> 01:50:00,888
You're a wonderful man.

1774
01:50:01,573 --> 01:50:03,696
God bless you, my boy.

1775
01:50:05,106 --> 01:50:06,752
Now get in there and pitch.

1776
01:50:11,573 --> 01:50:12,899
You're a fake and I can prove it.

1777
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:16,430
You're the big hero that's
meant to jump off tall buildings.

1778
01:50:16,795 --> 01:50:17,708
Remember?

1779
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:20,323
What will your precious
John Does say when they find out

1780
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:22,649
you had no intention of doing it?

1781
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:24,419
That you were paid to say so?

1782
01:50:24,588 --> 01:50:26,713
Christmas Eve, at midnight.

1783
01:50:49,933 --> 01:50:51,418
Merry Christmas, sir.

1784
01:50:52,945 --> 01:50:54,177
Oh! Merry Christmas.

1785
01:51:21,785 --> 01:51:23,783
Who? John Doe?

1786
01:51:24,316 --> 01:51:26,233
Is that screwball still around?

1787
01:51:26,404 --> 01:51:28,688
That dame's been calling all day.

1788
01:51:28,854 --> 01:51:31,858
Sure, sure, I know.
At midnight, huh?

1789
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:35,513
Okay, lady. We'll have
the place surrounded with nets.

1790
01:51:37,088 --> 01:51:38,766
They're laughing at me.

1791
01:51:44,721 --> 01:51:46,959
You're a sick girl, Ann.
You better take it easy.

1792
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:51,140
Who are you calling now?

1793
01:51:52,231 --> 01:51:55,315
You called that number,
not ten minutes ago.

1794
01:51:56,206 --> 01:51:58,857
Hello. Mr. Connell.
Have you seen him yet?

1795
01:51:59,019 --> 01:52:01,908
Listen, Ann. He can't get in
without our seeing him.

1796
01:52:02,473 --> 01:52:05,796
I'm watching the side door.
Colonel's out front. Stop worrying.

1797
01:52:08,659 --> 01:52:09,698
Thank you.

1798
01:52:15,768 --> 01:52:18,086
- Why Ann!
- Ann, don't be foolish.

1799
01:52:22,355 --> 01:52:24,595
If this isn't the craziest,

1800
01:52:24,766 --> 01:52:26,844
the battiest, the looniest
wild goose chase I ever heard of.

1801
01:52:27,014 --> 01:52:28,532
Shut up, Bert.
Sourpuss is right.

1802
01:52:28,701 --> 01:52:30,746
If he is, I'm a banana split.

1803
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,714
That man's gonna be on that roof.

1804
01:52:32,878 --> 01:52:35,563
Don't ask me how I know.
I know as well as you do.

1805
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:37,169
I'd like to believe in fairy tales,

1806
01:52:37,337 --> 01:52:40,226
but a guy that's a fake
won't jump off any roof.

1807
01:52:40,591 --> 01:52:43,321
I don't think he was a fake.
Not with that face.

1808
01:52:43,483 --> 01:52:47,206
- What he stood for wasn't a fake.
- Okay, honey. Okay.

1809
01:53:06,177 --> 01:53:07,662
Elevators ain't runnin'.

1810
01:53:08,507 --> 01:53:10,984
- Colonel.
- You shouldn't be out of bed.

1811
01:53:11,438 --> 01:53:12,924
- Has he been here?
- No.

1812
01:53:13,085 --> 01:53:14,845
- Have you seen him?
- Haven't seen him for a week.

1813
01:53:15,013 --> 01:53:17,137
- Where's Connell?
- He's watching the other door.

1814
01:53:17,302 --> 01:53:18,424
You're swell.

1815
01:53:23,769 --> 01:53:26,659
No sense going up. I been here
for hours. He ain't here.

1816
01:53:26,822 --> 01:53:27,941
Let me go, will ya?

1817
01:53:32,445 --> 01:53:35,176
That's crazy. It's 14 floors.

1818
01:54:18,115 --> 01:54:21,404
It's as far as the elevator goes.
We walk up to the tower.

1819
01:55:13,264 --> 01:55:16,713
That tramp's probably full of
Christmas cheer in a flophouse.

1820
01:55:16,878 --> 01:55:18,923
I've got to decorate my tree.

1821
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:33,642
Well, I give up.

1822
01:55:34,805 --> 01:55:36,846
I don't what gave us the idea

1823
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:38,892
he'd attempt anything like this.

1824
01:55:39,056 --> 01:55:39,728
I guess you're right.

1825
01:55:39,897 --> 01:55:41,572
I'm afraid the joke's on us.

1826
01:55:41,742 --> 01:55:44,661
I hope nobody
finds out we've been here.

1827
01:57:30,438 --> 01:57:32,479
I wouldn't do that, John.

1828
01:57:44,471 --> 01:57:45,987
It'll do you no good.

1829
01:57:47,118 --> 01:57:48,792
The Mayor has police downstairs

1830
01:57:49,484 --> 01:57:50,840
with instructions

1831
01:57:51,008 --> 01:57:53,811
to remove all identification
you may have on your person.

1832
01:57:55,297 --> 01:57:59,094
You'll be buried in Potter's Field.
You'll have accomplished nothing.

1833
01:58:09,933 --> 01:58:11,574
I've already taken care of that.

1834
01:58:13,179 --> 01:58:16,257
I mailed a copy
of this letter to Mr. Connell.

1835
01:58:19,354 --> 01:58:20,914
John, forget this foolishness.

1836
01:58:21,078 --> 01:58:24,966
Stop there, Mr. Norton,
if you don't want to go over too.

1837
01:58:29,817 --> 01:58:32,099
I'm glad you gentlemen are here.

1838
01:58:34,228 --> 01:58:36,703
You killed the
John Doe movement all right,

1839
01:58:37,636 --> 01:58:40,032
but you'll see it born again.

1840
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:49,581
Take a good look, Mr. Norton.

1841
01:58:51,069 --> 01:58:52,025
John!

1842
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:53,511
John!

1843
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:57,682
John! Don't do it!

1844
01:58:57,844 --> 01:58:59,680
I love you, darling.

1845
01:58:59,849 --> 01:59:00,842
Please.

1846
01:59:02,093 --> 01:59:03,771
Please don't give up.

1847
01:59:03,939 --> 01:59:07,621
We'll start all over again.
Just you and I. It isn't too late.

1848
01:59:07,786 --> 01:59:10,103
The John Doe movement
isn't dead yet.

1849
01:59:11,076 --> 01:59:13,197
It isn't dead
or they wouldn't be here.

1850
01:59:13,681 --> 01:59:17,400
It's alive in them. They kept it
alive by being afraid of it.

1851
01:59:17,571 --> 01:59:19,213
That's why they came up here.

1852
01:59:19,534 --> 01:59:20,813
Oh, darling!

1853
01:59:21,901 --> 01:59:24,181
Sure it should have been killed.
It was dishonest.

1854
01:59:24,347 --> 01:59:27,027
But we can start clean now.
Just you and I.

1855
01:59:27,594 --> 01:59:29,716
It'll grow, John,

1856
01:59:29,881 --> 01:59:32,640
because it'll be
honest this time.

1857
01:59:33,369 --> 01:59:35,410
John, if it's worth dying for,

1858
01:59:35,572 --> 01:59:37,491
it's worth living for.

1859
01:59:38,219 --> 01:59:40,135
Please, John!

1860
01:59:43,273 --> 01:59:47,194
Please!
Please God, help me!

1861
01:59:49,928 --> 01:59:51,000
John!

1862
01:59:51,411 --> 01:59:52,529
John, look at me!

1863
01:59:53,255 --> 01:59:55,330
You want to be honest, don't you?

1864
01:59:55,501 --> 01:59:58,705
You don't have to die
to keep the John Doe idea alive.

1865
01:59:58,908 --> 02:00:02,227
Someone already died for that once.
The first John Doe.

1866
02:00:02,878 --> 02:00:05,637
And he's kept that idea
alive for nearly 2,000 years.

1867
02:00:06,125 --> 02:00:09,683
It was he who kept it alive
and he'll go on keeping it alive

1868
02:00:09,855 --> 02:00:10,891
forever and always.

1869
02:00:11,058 --> 02:00:14,660
For every John Doe movement
they kill, another will be born.

1870
02:00:14,987 --> 02:00:16,982
That's why those bells are ringing.

1871
02:00:17,511 --> 02:00:18,790
They're calling to us.

1872
02:00:18,997 --> 02:00:22,394
Not to give up, but keep on
fighting, keep on pitching.

1873
02:00:22,564 --> 02:00:23,841
Don't you see, darling?

1874
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:26,645
This is no time to give up.

1875
02:00:27,014 --> 02:00:29,250
You and I John, we...

1876
02:00:30,424 --> 02:00:31,493
No!

1877
02:00:32,066 --> 02:00:35,030
No, John! If you die,
I want to die, too.

1878
02:00:37,038 --> 02:00:38,361
I love you!

1879
02:00:52,596 --> 02:00:55,400
Mr. Doe, you don't have to...

1880
02:00:56,807 --> 02:00:58,642
We're with you, Mr. Doe.

1881
02:00:58,809 --> 02:01:00,932
We just lost our heads
and acted like a mob.

1882
02:01:01,095 --> 02:01:04,620
What Bert's trying to say
is that we need you.

1883
02:01:04,905 --> 02:01:07,585
A lot of us didn't believe
what that man said.

1884
02:01:07,951 --> 02:01:11,510
We were going to start up our
Club again, with or without you.

1885
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:15,078
Weren't we, Bert?
A lot of others will do the same.

1886
02:01:15,249 --> 02:01:18,007
Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter
from his cousin in Toledo...

1887
02:01:18,175 --> 02:01:19,772
I got it right here, Mr. Doe.

1888
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:23,381
Only, it'd be a lot easier
with you. Please...

1889
02:01:25,674 --> 02:01:27,909
Please come with us, Mr. Doe.

1890
02:01:53,298 --> 02:01:54,530
Long John!

1891
02:01:54,781 --> 02:01:56,012
Mr. Doe!

1892
02:01:56,466 --> 02:02:00,070
- We'll help. She'll be all right.
- Take her down to the car.

1893
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:06,722
There you are, Norton.
The people! Try and lick that!
