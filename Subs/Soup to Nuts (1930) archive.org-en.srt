1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,738
FROM HEART TO TAIL
(1930)

2
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:42,940
THERE WILL NEVER BE HARMONY IN THE HOME
WHILE PEOPLE

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,673
THEY GROW THEIR SOUP.
THERE WILL NEVER BE PEACE

4
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,579
IN MARRIAGE AS WIVES
THROWING NUT SHELLS ON THE FLOOR

5
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:53,119
FOR YOUR HUSBANDS
STEP BAREFOOT.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,552
SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN THE SOUP AND THE NUTS...

7
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,125
MAYBE IN FISH OR APPLE BROTH...

8
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,989
THERE MUST BE JOY
AND CONTENTMENT.

9
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,095
Rube Goldberg

10
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,166
That phone won't stop ringing.

11
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,397
Al�.

12
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,607
Who? Hey Ted.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,904
Alright, I'm coming down!

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,314
Call you.

15
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,713
All good.
All good.

16
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,926
I didn't see that. It's a good one.
I hadn't even seen it.

17
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,019
Because I could have
moved there...

18
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,868
What? That one?

19
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,803
That one?

20
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,550
That was good.

21
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,227
Hey, aren't you going to answer the phone?

22
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,097
All good.

23
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,466
-I think it's the chatterbox again.
-Don't talk like that.

24
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,041
Al�. Al�.

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,200
How are you, Queenie?

26
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,570
Al�. Is that you, Ted?

27
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,979
Listen, asshole,
he should be ashamed.

28
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,346
Get paid to work here
at Schmidt Costume Shop

29
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,647
and stays all day
at the fire department.

30
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:34,846
You donkey!

31
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,290
Don't call me stupid, you bitch!

32
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,486
It's the girlfriend.
A delicate lady.

33
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,618
Say 'hi' for us.

34
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,594
-Send my regards.
-And mine too.

35
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,687
The boys said 'hi'.

36
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:49,134
Oh, huh? These three are
the scum of the world.

37
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,730
She speaks very highly of you.

38
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,272
She always liked us.

39
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,772
Yes, she likes you.

40
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,037
Someday she will be
a great wife to me.

41
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,475
Shut up, it's going to explode
my eardrums!

42
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,673
I'm talking to Ted,
my boyfriend.

43
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,808
He is very sweet.
I'm crazy about him.

44
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,949
I'll break your face
when you get here.

45
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,513
Hey guys, let's rehearse
for the Firefighters Ball.

46
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,023
Come on, one more time.

47
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,752
Give me some wool.

48
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,190
Again.

49
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,628
This one works.

50
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,293
<i>You'll never know</i>

51
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,200
I don't hear anything.
Wait one moment.

52
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,863
I don't hear...
I don't hear...

53
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,531
<i>What are tears</i>

54
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,836
Guys, wait there.

55
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:35,915
<i>Until you cry
how you made me cry</i>

56
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,745
<i>What a broken heart feels like</i>

57
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,877
All good!

58
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,753
<i>Even though it's fun</i>

59
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:48,728
<i>You'll never know</i>

60
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:53,299
<i>Until you find the wrong guy</i>

61
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,969
<i>To love and kiss</i>

62
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:02,042
<i>And lose everything</i>

63
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,605
Okay, pull.

64
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,236
<i>To discover that
every promise</i>

65
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,972
<i>� lie</i>

66
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,277
Come here, will you?

67
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,548
<i>You'll never know</i>

68
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,458
<i>What are tears</i>

69
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,191
<i>Until you cry</i>

70
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,354
All good.

71
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:31,370
<i>How it made me cry</i>

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,468
It fell on you.
What do you think of that?

73
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,600
What do you think of that?
Fell into it instead of...

74
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,368
-All good.
-Do you understand?

75
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,538
I am tired.
I can't take it anymore.

76
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,445
Oh, I forgot about Queenie.

77
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,849
If you're going to stay in the fire department
instead of staying with me,

78
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,956
I will complicate your life.

79
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:53,092
There is nothing to say
worth listening to.

80
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,787
Oh, huh?
I'll show you whether I can do it or not.

81
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,160
Don't know how to treat a lady,
you clown.

82
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,892
Listen, my dear...

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,264
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
We are not married yet.

84
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,635
She's breathing fire from her ears.
Just look.

85
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,768
We have to get to Queenie quickly.
Maybe it's an alarm.

86
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,403
Come on, boys.

87
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,338
There he goes.

88
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,415
This is the hottest June
that we have had since last July.

89
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,747
How new.
I know it's hot.

90
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,788
Yes, yesterday it was so hot that
I had to get up and take off my socks.

91
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,448
Stop it.

92
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,727
If you think you're going to get away with this,
he's crazy.

93
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,697
Who do you think you are?

94
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,569
-Is everything under control?
-Yes.

95
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,699
Come on, get up.
Get up.

96
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,777
Look!

97
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,915
-Maybe I'm wrong.
-Go ahead, boys.

98
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,819
And then,
As far as I'm concerned,

99
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,490
I don't care if I never see him again,
he understands?

100
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,828
-Goodbye!
-Hello.

101
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,902
I was talking to myself!
Why, you big...

102
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,340
I want you to meet Mr. Throckmorton.
He is an aviator.

103
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,636
And called the fire department
to tell me this?

104
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,042
What did you say his name was?

105
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,808
Throckmorton.
D. Quincy Throckmorton.

106
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,384
What was your name
before immigrating?

107
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,213
I was born here.

108
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,289
One of the old Throckmortons
from the gas company.

109
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,253
I forgot to say,
Mr. Schmidt wants to see you.

110
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,726
Get him out of here as soon as you can.

111
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,066
If it continues like this,
I'll put you back in the cage.

112
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,953
Hello, boss.
What it was?

113
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,852
Teddy, the creditors come
take care of business today.

114
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,758
They can't do that to you.

115
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,523
They already did.

116
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,760
-I'm going to kick them out of here...
-No, no.

117
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,336
A failure after 20 years.

118
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,941
-Maybe Louise will find a solution.
-No, no.

119
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,940
Louise can't know.

120
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,737
But she will find out
sooner or later.

121
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,974
Maybe something will happen.
An earthquake or the end of the world.

122
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,877
And those gadgets and inventions?

123
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,579
Maybe make money
with them one day.

124
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:11,385
No, this just happens
in books and films.

125
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,590
What's that, boss?

126
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,089
It's my idea

127
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:20,133
to clean the lapel sauce
when eating stew.

128
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,327
-The lapel sauce.
-Yes, see.

129
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,733
-I'll show you. Go ahead.
-Should I eat?

130
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,670
-It saw!
- It's very good.

131
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:30,505
When the sauce splashes,
he cleans it when he passes.

132
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,339
Very good.

133
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,812
Clean it when it passes.
It's very good.

134
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,938
Very good.

135
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,882
But there are no sponges
for me to put in my eyes

136
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,454
when cutting oranges, do you have it?

137
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,388
I like that.

138
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,084
This is my favorite.

139
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,290
-What does she do?
-Wait, I'll show you. Look.

140
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,859
It's my hat that salutes.

141
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,326
What I want is a waiter
bring me healthy food.

142
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,930
What is the idea of ​​the top hat?

143
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,941
When you're walking down the street
on a cold winter day,

144
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,068
and finds a lady,

145
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,206
no need to take your hands off
from his pockets to greet her.

146
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,476
Hello.

147
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,714
Hello.

148
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,114
Did you like it?

149
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,748
Yes and no.

150
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,024
Yes and no?

151
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,021
I'll try again.

152
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,556
Hello.

153
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,894
Good?

154
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,064
The idea is good,
but it is of no use to me

155
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,467
because I don't know
no lady.

156
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,706
Come on.
I'll show you another one.

157
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,710
It's my automatic adopter
of coffee.

158
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,045
Here is the cup of coffee
and here, the sugar.

159
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,244
You put it here.
It's a ball.

160
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,650
-A ball.
-You put it here.

161
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,346
This is a pool cue.

162
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,293
I hit the ball
and the sugar goes in the cup!

163
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,760
Wonderful!
Wonderful!

164
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,098
But what do you do
with the beef stew?

165
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,362
But what do you do
with the beef stew?

166
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,132
I'll work on that later.

167
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,465
Teddy, come here, boy.

168
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,632
-I'll show you my best.
-The best invention, huh?

169
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,569
That's what I call
anti-theft alarm.

170
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,235
-Anti-theft alarm?
-Yes.

171
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,475
When the thief enters
through the window...

172
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,277
-Yes.
-...he steps on that button.

173
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,512
Does he step on the button like that?

174
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,645
Teddy, be careful!

175
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,757
Careful? I'm dead.
He almost killed me with that.

176
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:25,950
-Are you hurt?
-What is that?

177
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,458
That's what I want to know.

178
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,120
That? Oh, this powder?

179
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,726
He kicks the thief
out the window.

180
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,367
For the slide,
and the turntable.

181
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,497
The table rotates and also
the mouse.

182
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,240
Here is my cat with a
string tied to the tail,

183
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,871
and on the other side there is a watering can
over my bed.

184
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,212
I'm sleeping on the floor
above, below the watering can.

185
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,515
The cat sees the mouse, runs after it,
pull the string,

186
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,453
turn the watering can
and the water wets me,

187
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,185
and then I wake up...

188
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,057
Very good.
He says the thief slips here,

189
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,187
and spins,

190
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,267
and the mouse spins,
the cat sees it,

191
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,131
with the string and the water.

192
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,430
Come here for a minute.

193
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,533
See how simple it is, Teddy?

194
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,666
It takes so long that the thief dies
of old age before being captured.

195
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,711
How are you?
I'd like to see Mr. Schmidt, please.

196
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,045
Are these your three children?

197
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,924
No, they are experts in efficiency.

198
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,463
If you're going to buy them costumes,
I would leave them as they are.

199
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,090
-They're already pretty funny.
-Thanks for the tip.

200
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,667
Just a minute and I'll see
if Mr. Schmidt can assist you.

201
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,101
Thanks.

202
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,642
A sinister guy is here
with the Three Musketeers.

203
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,239
Well, here they are.

204
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,075
I go there and take care of them
one by one...

205
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,775
Who will be the young man?
He has beautiful eyes.

206
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,976
I'll give you a pat.

207
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,450
Go ahead
and give me a pat...

208
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,817
Don't worry about me, I can hit.
Don't worry.

209
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,688
It's young Carlson.
He came to take over the business.

210
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,988
I'm broke.

211
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,687
What is bankrupt?

212
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,094
-What is bankrupt?
-A failure.

213
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,666
I lost everything.

214
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,827
Okay, he opened his beak.
Now she's going to tell Louise.

215
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,631
Queenie, please
Don't tell Louise.

216
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,934
She can't keep a secret.
She's a chatterbox.

217
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,633
You can stop, pyromaniac.

218
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,005
Quiet, airhead.

219
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,907
-Be quiet you!
-Quiet!

220
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,946
-Quiet!
-I'll tell you.

221
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,642
Tell them to come in.

222
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,012
Come here.

223
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,142
If you tell Louise,
I'll slap you,

224
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,745
and it won't be on the face.

225
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,459
This way, sir. Carlson.

226
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,290
You can bring the
three strangers with you.

227
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,629
Thanks.

228
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,871
I'm sorry, sir. Schmidt,

229
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,949
but my father sent me
to take over the store.

230
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,847
Yes yes.

231
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,586
You know, if it were up to me,
I wouldn't do that.

232
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,687
No. No.

233
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,156
See, my father is
the main creditor...

234
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,061
Creditor! Creditor!

235
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,925
It's what rich people
They call it business.

236
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:27,335
They send their useless children around
to close down places like this

237
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,841
just to keep them
away from trouble.

238
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,875
Rich people.

239
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,571
Modern ideas!

240
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,274
Cheating!

241
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,967
-Hello.
-Hello.

242
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,239
Are you injured?

243
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,506
No, and you?

244
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm still not sure.

245
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,617
I better get it
these things.

246
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,314
Don't move.

247
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,755
All good.

248
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,187
They're brown, aren't they?

249
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,387
What?

250
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,732
The feathers?

251
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,131
No, your eyes.

252
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,495
I think I better go.

253
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,670
-Don't go.
-Goodbye.

254
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,808
Goodbye.

255
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,042
Goodbye.

256
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,010
Damn!

257
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,096
Look, brainless,
when to meet Louise

258
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,365
keep your mouth shut.

259
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,134
- Brainless?
-Yes, I'm serious.

260
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,210
I met a really nice guy.

261
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,108
-Who is he?
-I don't know.

262
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,476
But he has eyes
and brown hair.

263
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,243
He wore a brown suit
and a light brown tie.

264
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,319
He didn't pay attention to him.

265
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,980
He had a gray hat
with a black belt?

266
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,319
-Light brown shoes? I don't know him.
-Yes.

267
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,257
Louise, introduce me to him?

268
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,953
Do you want to meet
all the men you see.

269
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,587
I'll let you see the Minister of War
and you will know the Army.

270
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,189
I'll introduce you to the Navy,
the marines are good people.

271
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,267
-Same?
-Yes.

272
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,564
I can't introduce her
because I don't know his name.

273
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,332
-Is he cool?
-I would say yes.

274
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,534
Isn't life funny?

275
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,167
This is philosophy.

276
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,074
To think that you would know
a nice guy

277
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,410
the day your uncle Otto
will be thrown out.

278
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,643
Go to the pharmacy
and buy me some syrup.

279
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,981
-But, Queenie, what do you mean?
-Didn't you know?

280
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,576
The place is in your hands
of a receiver.

281
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,986
Is there a creditor or something
who will take over.

282
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,649
Uncle Otto
will be sent away.

283
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,158
But Teddy and I will stay,
dear.

284
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,058
-It can't be.
-Don't believe it.

285
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,028
-I say no...
-Don't call me a liar.

286
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,327
I heard it from Mr. Schmidt himself.

287
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,834
Sincerely, dear,
I'm very sorry.

288
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,197
It can't be that bad.

289
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,434
Don't worry, Louise,
everything will end well.

290
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:24,112
-You big head!
-I couldn't help it, he escaped.

291
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,912
You open your mouth
and the words escape.

292
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,144
I'm going to put a zipper over your mouth.

293
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,314
Go ahead, cry.
You can cry.

294
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,084
Cry if you want.
I don't care.

295
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,387
Say, old man,
you can't do that!

296
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,762
Help! Help!

297
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,665
Turn on the lights!

298
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,496
Turn on the lights!

299
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,132
You can't put a zipper on
in the girl's mouth!

300
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,411
Uncle Otto!
Uncle Otto!

301
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,807
Sir...

302
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,815
Carlson.

303
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,822
Mr. Carlson,
something terrible happens...

304
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,523
My uncle went bankrupt.

305
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,757
Don't be sad about it.

306
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,959
But someone terrible will come here
to take over the store.

307
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm not leaving you, I'm telling you.
I won't let you.

308
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,840
Maybe he's not
so terrible.

309
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,240
Mr. Carlson, we've prepared everything.

310
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,375
Now we leave it
in command.

311
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,580
-You?
-Please listen to me.

312
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,159
-A few minutes ago we were talking...
-I hate you!

313
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,220
OFFICE

314
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,964
She must have had problems
with the new boss.

315
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,556
I'll take care of it.

316
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,497
There's no way to forget
all this?

317
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,489
-What is that?
-Old Schmidt.

318
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,151
He always plays like that
when you don't feel well.

319
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,024
I think he's in very bad shape.

320
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,187
Do you think he is
feeling bad?

321
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,297
The way you're playing
You must have high blood pressure.

322
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,768
I need to go see
what is the problem.

323
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,673
Poor Uncle Otto.

324
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,712
I think we were
too happy.

325
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,916
Do you know?
Did you find out?

326
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,653
But I won't let
to throw us out.

327
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,285
They can't close the place down.

328
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,487
We'll be fine here.

329
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,654
Listen. I've been thinking,

330
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,391
we can help and achieve
more orders

331
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,058
and pay off debts quickly.

332
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,464
Then Carlson leaves.

333
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,560
-See, Uncle Otto, we're staying.
-Certainly.

334
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,730
Certainly. I received an order
of a ventriloquist.

335
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,467
He wants a new suit
for the doll.

336
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,738
I can rent my cousin a suit.
He's dying.

337
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,241
I'm a great businessman.

338
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,213
And there are costume requests
for the Firefighters Ball.

339
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,115
I'm pretty excited.
Let's show Carlson.

340
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,813
-Yes, he will see.
-No, my dear.

341
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,787
I still have my pride.

342
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,855
Otto Schmidt cannot work
to another boss in your business.

343
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,862
I'd rather starve.

344
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,629
-Where are you going?
-It doesn't matter.

345
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,737
You and Teddy stay here.

346
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,673
Don't worry, I'm fine.

347
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,242
Don't go, Otto.

348
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,467
I will be back.

349
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,878
I think better
when I'm far from here.

350
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,346
Goodbye.

351
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,224
My funny friends.

352
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,890
We had a good laugh together.

353
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,563
There's something funny
in every thing.

354
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,371
I'm laughing with you.

355
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,344
And you, my gallant knight,

356
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:25,288
remember that I created it
since it was a can.

357
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,590
Goodbye.

358
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,702
Goodbye.

359
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,256
Newspapers from around the world.

360
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,328
KLEIN'S INN

361
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,535
Try <i>borscht</i>
with <i>mit sauer kraut.</i>

362
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,728
No!

363
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,972
Take it away!

364
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,716
Waiter,
bring me hot water.

365
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,255
Would you like anything else?

366
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,687
Yes!

367
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:35,352
Let the orchestra play "The Best
Things in Life Are Free."

368
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,845
That's the type of clients I have.

369
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:06,982
It saw?

370
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,494
-There's another one over there.
-Who is he?

371
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,431
The cartoonist, Rube Goldberg.

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,059
He also doesn't spend anything.

373
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,535
Just come here to open
your correspondence.

374
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:24,270
I know everything about cartoonists.
They are all the same.

375
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,479
What's your problem?

376
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,571
Don't look so happy
as usual.

377
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,980
Trouble, Gus, trouble.

378
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,246
Come, Frank,
<i>setzen Siesichnieder.</i>

379
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,181
Gus, I lost my
costume store.

380
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,690
Finally it happens...

381
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,662
Yes, the creditors took over today.

382
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,193
But they didn't let him stay there?

383
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:52,100
Who wants to stay in one place
with another man as a boss?

384
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,672
I understand.

385
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,173
-You are always welcome here.
-Yes.

386
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,802
I don't need another waiter,

387
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,778
but you can wear an apron
and stay seated.

388
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,245
Anything is better
to go back to that place.

389
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,189
I think you need something more
Stronger than words to cheer you up.

390
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,081
Try this.

391
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,855
Is it good?

392
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,358
My son-in-law works
on a ship.

393
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,637
I should have more sons-in-law.

394
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,613
When does the next ship arrive?

395
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,582
Don't worry,
I have plenty of the last shipment.

396
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,179
Good.

397
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,157
Ships are
wonderful inventions.

398
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,761
How are you feeling now,
Otto?

399
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,701
Wanting to play.

400
00:23:58,871 --> 00:23:59,861
Wait one moment!

401
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,565
Let's play together
like the old days.

402
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:03,842
Good!

403
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,133
Silence!

404
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:43,409
Stay away from here before
I shove it down your throat!

405
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,052
Hey, stop playing!

406
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,181
-Where have you been?
-What?

407
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,189
I was worried about you.

408
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,091
I am fine. Don't you see?
I'm great.

409
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,821
Ah, Uncle Otto, be careful.

410
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,796
-Listen, Uncle Otto.
-What?

411
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,636
I think it's time to go to bed.

412
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,269
-�. You're right.
-Good evening, Uncle Otto.

413
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,345
Alright, <i>Liebchen.</i>

414
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,046
Goodnight.

415
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,859
Hello, Otto! How are you?

416
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,158
-Teddy.
-It's good to see you.

417
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,029
-How are things going?
-Good.

418
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,931
I'm putting
the place on the axes.

419
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,525
The same old Teddy.

420
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,831
Open the game,
What are you up to at night?

421
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,436
-I have a job.
-A job, where?

422
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,737
I'm a waiter at the restaurant
by Gus Klein.

423
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,475
-A waiter?
-Waiter.

424
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,976
But please
Don't tell Louise.

425
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,248
Do you think I'm like Queenie?
I swear.

426
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,890
Don't worry.
Louise won't find out.

427
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,755
Well done, my boy.

428
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,821
Louise and her uncle
They are too proud.

429
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,990
I want you to pretend to be
a theater producer

430
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,128
and order enough costumes
to cover all debt.

431
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:49,264
And order direct from Teddy.
He thinks he's saving the store.

432
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,206
But, Mr. Carlson, what about your father?

433
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,210
Don't worry,
You are also my lawyer.

434
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,609
But why are you doing this?

435
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,681
I'll give you three chances
to guess.

436
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,347
One is enough.

437
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:07,555
Very well, if that's what you want,
I will do what you ask of me.

438
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,560
Okay, Ferguson.
Let's get to work.

439
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,766
And don't forget,
place the order with Ted.

440
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,595
-He's the tall young man.
-Very good.

441
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,676
Help! Let me out.
My back.

442
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,974
Let me go. I'm trapped.
Let me go.

443
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,947
Oh no, let me go.

444
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,015
What were you doing?
inside?

445
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,651
I'm a mummy. I've been dead
2 thousand years and I just woke up.

446
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,686
You were listening, right?

447
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,658
You nosy.

448
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:47,092
If you tell anyone,
twist your neck. Did you understand?

449
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,998
You can hit me.
I love brutality.

450
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,099
Please,
Don't tell Louise.

451
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,604
-My name is Ferguson.
-Nice to meet you.

452
00:27:56,708 --> 00:28:00,144
I will assemble several
theatrical productions.

453
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,971
-I heard about your good work.
-Have you heard about my work?

454
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,380
I want you to provide
all costumes.

455
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,920
Do you want me to provide
all costumes?

456
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,785
Here's a check
advance payment.

457
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,484
I'll come by later
to discuss the drawings.

458
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,528
-Does this check have funds?
-Why do you ask?

459
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,725
I'll tell you why. Last week
a guy gave me this one. Look.

460
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,235
-This is not that type.
-I hope not.

461
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,827
What kind of costumes do you want?

462
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:31,740
I don't have time to look at this now.
I'll let you know later.

463
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,369
There will be more requests later.

464
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,781
-Good morning.
-Come back often.

465
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,942
He heard?
There will be more requests.

466
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,022
Look. Louise! Louise!

467
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:46,750
-Have you lost your mind?
-No, look.

468
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,019
Did you sell the store?

469
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,618
I got a request from a man
from the theater called Ferguson.

470
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,026
I've never heard of him.

471
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,121
He's new on the block
and we will have more orders.

472
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,827
-He's a great businessman.
-I know.

473
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,664
Let's show Carlson.

474
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,330
Let's celebrate now
with a great meal.

475
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,636
Did I hear someone talk about food?

476
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,641
Did someone call her?

477
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,178
Let's go to Klein's
eat German food.

478
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,407
Klein's! No, we're not going there.
We're not going to Klein's.

479
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,982
It's my party.
We're not going to Klein's.

480
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,744
Let's get ready.
Let's go to Klein's.

481
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,250
Don't go to Klein's!

482
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:16,720
Wow, darling,
I'm glad we're going to Klein's.

483
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,880
But we can't go.
We can't go to Klein's.

484
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,619
Klein's.
She chooses Klein's.

485
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,558
Four million seats
and she chooses Klein's.

486
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,757
-What do you think of that? Klein's.
-Al�.

487
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,365
Al�, Otto.
Is it you?

488
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,436
Listen, let me talk.

489
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,733
Queenie invited Louise to
go eat there and I can't stop them.

490
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,207
Listen, I'm going with them
and I go in front

491
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,743
and I give you a sign
to get down.

492
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,313
Did you understand?
Okay, bye.

493
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,420
They have the best sausages
and sauerkraut that I've already eaten.

494
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,354
And apple strudel.
Damn!

495
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,947
Can't we go somewhere else?

496
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,154
Let's go to Klein's.
When I make pianos, I don't change.

497
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,232
All right, let's go to Klein's.
What do you think of that, Klein's.

498
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,529
-Let's go by subway.
-Tax!

499
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,729
-Taxi? What do you think of that?
-Tax! Taxi!

500
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:15,177
-Open the door.
-I'll open it. I've already taken a taxi. Between.

501
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,707
86th Street and 3rd Avenue.

502
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,147
It can leave.

503
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:26,524
The subway is not good for you,
Do you have to take a taxi?

504
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,959
Listen!
Did you hear?

505
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,058
It looks like a fire.
Excuse me, girls.

506
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,533
Alright, let's go.

507
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,171
-Come on, Ted, go up.
-Okay, Pete, put your foot down!

508
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,571
Incredible, isn't it?

509
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,785
Do we have enough gas?

510
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,192
I just saw the tank
and it's halfway through.

511
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,526
I don't know if it's half full
or half empty.

512
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,396
What do you think of that?

513
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,874
-Who is pushing?
-Where's the fire?

514
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,747
There's no fire. We are taking
some girls to hang out with.

515
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,115
-How is it?
-Yes, that's where they live.

516
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,484
-Hello, my dear. How are you?
-Hello, boys.

517
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,016
I hope they don't stay
no gas this time.

518
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,822
I like the small one.

519
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,156
Come on, I hope my lady
remember me.

520
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,334
Dear,
is wearing a new hat.

521
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,528
-My passion.
-Hello, Helen.

522
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,940
Okay, let's go.

523
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,668
You girls
they will have fun.

524
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,335
Calm,
Don't get hurt before...

525
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,914
If there is no fire,
drop me off at Klein.

526
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,948
All good,
but you'll miss out on the fun.

527
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,575
-Don't worry about me.
-Come on, Pete.

528
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,278
Come on, Pete.

529
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,737
- It's the best race of your life.
-�.

530
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,571
Wait a little.

531
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,441
Baby, come on, kiss me.

532
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,274
Like this?
Wait there.

533
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,940
Do you want that beautiful woman
hug you?

534
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,779
I have my moments.

535
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,319
-The cutie has her moments.
-�.

536
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,217
And look at this guy.

537
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,356
-Annoyed.
-All good...

538
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,702
He will arrive
any minute.

539
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,634
He doesn't need to rush
if you get here

540
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:26,898
in time to pay the bill.

541
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,520
-Stay, Ted, we have one more girl.
-No, no...

542
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,520
Watch out, girls.
Don't let the boys turn them back on their feet.

543
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,753
Hey, Pete,
Take us to Coney Island.

544
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,657
-Bye, Ted.
-Bye, bye...

545
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,822
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

546
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,041
Want to leave me alone,
Please.

547
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:14,084
Keep that.
Want to hear a funny sound?

548
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,152
Put your neck there.

549
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,426
You old idiot,
Didn't I say I wanted it rare?

550
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,560
- Still not sure?
-No.

551
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,730
They should put relics like you
in chloroform.

552
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,098
You are not good at anything.

553
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,639
Yes, I think you're right.
I made a mistake.

554
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,445
-I am really sorry.
-He looks like Uncle Otto.

555
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,485
-Louise. Now, Ted told me...
-Uncle Otto.

556
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,147
I am well darling.

557
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,885
See just why I didn't want to
bring you here?

558
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,961
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Why didn't I tell you?

559
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,154
Don't make me laugh.

560
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,300
Come home with us.
The store is doing well now.

561
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,503
I'm glad to know that.
But I'm fine here.

562
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,332
But the way that man
spoke to you.

563
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,532
I don't care about that.

564
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,768
Come on.
I even lost my appetite.

565
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,242
-I am hungry.
-I am hungry.

566
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,871
-Hey, waiter...
-I'm coming.

567
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:19,076
See you later, Louise.
See you tomorrow morning.

568
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,709
Let's go, Louise.

569
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,652
Let's eat somewhere else.

570
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,124
I am hungry.

571
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,555
-What's up now?
-The steak is horrible.

572
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,289
The bread is hard, the butter is bad.
The potatoes are cold.

573
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:36,333
-Is the rest ok?
-No, the towel is dirty.

574
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,595
The towel is dirty.

575
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,502
Okay,
let's solve this now.

576
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,743
Is it better now?
The towel is dirty.

577
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,613
-I'm going to close this place down!
-Go away before I lose my mind.

578
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,151
Are you going to shut us down for this?

579
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,994
I'm sorry, Gus,
I lost my mind.

580
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,966
It's okay, Otto.
I don't blame him.

581
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,297
We are good businessmen.

582
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,400
My business went to hell
and yours is going.

583
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:19,500
Yes.

584
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,675
Remember how angry we were
When did we arrive from Europe?

585
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:25,874
When they said never
we could be president

586
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,316
Why weren't we born here?

587
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,984
We could have been born anywhere
and we would still be stupid.

588
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:39,993
This restaurant is
becoming outdated.

589
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:43,834
People want new things.

590
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,234
Look over there.

591
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,617
Gustav!

592
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:09,426
Why can't we
do something similar?

593
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,219
You call this place
from "Yodel Inn",

594
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,728
-Don't call?
-Yes.

595
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,059
Well, why don't you put
a Swiss decoration here?

596
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,797
I can only pay
by Swiss cheese.

597
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:24,299
Look at this yard.
We can make it sophisticated.

598
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,910
-We painted fake mountains on the fence.
-Fake mountains?

599
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,310
Well, they look like mountains,
but they are false.

600
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,883
Imitation?

601
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,179
Then we dress the waiters
in mountaineer clothes.

602
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,549
Yes, but where are we going to fix it?
sweaty clothes?

603
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,125
Today, when it gets dark,
I'm going to the costume store.

604
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,161
I enter from behind.

605
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,357
Leave it to me.
I pack the sweats.

606
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,549
Uncle Otto!
Uncle Otto!

607
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,535
Are you injured?

608
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:08,046
-No.
-So what happened?

609
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,378
-No.
-So what happened?

610
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,472
I came to rob the store.

611
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,608
-Robbing the store?
-Yes.

612
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,955
Klein and I thought
in dressing the waiters

613
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:21,959
with Tyrolean costumes so that
the restaurant has a Swiss atmosphere.

614
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,529
-To improve profits.
-Ah, Uncle Otto.

615
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,061
So you decided
steal here?

616
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,704
This is not stealing.
This place is mine.

617
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,034
That guy can't come here
and steal this from me.

618
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:37,869
He is the thief.

619
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:42,079
You know it's wrong to take things
that don't belong to you.

620
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,383
-Yes I know.
-How many costumes do you want?

621
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:55,450
Louise, can we use
all Tyrolean fantasies

622
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,757
what we made for the picnic
two years ago.

623
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,696
-You are a bad man.
-Yes.

624
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,792
I got.

625
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,805
Careful, Uncle Otto.

626
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,543
My goodness, it works well.

627
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,213
Here they are.

628
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,583
See you soon.

629
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,492
Here's another advance check.

630
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,725
Don't you think we should do some
costumes first, so you can see?

631
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,497
No, I prefer to do
business my way.

632
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,165
I can't give you one
hat or shoe buckles?

633
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:47,108
-It would make me feel better.
-All good. Good morning.

634
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,573
I start to believe in fairy tales.
Maybe I'm a good businessman.

635
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,984
Behold Whispering Willie
again.

636
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,851
No, put it back.

637
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,726
Do you know what arsenic is?

638
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,093
Arsenic?

639
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,901
Well come on Wednesday
and I will have a nice bottle for you.

640
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,367
Look, Mommy.
These are Santa Claus's clothes.

641
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,535
He must be taking a shower.

642
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,149
-Hey, what are you doing down there?
-Benny sent me.

643
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,848
Benny sent you.
Is it your son?

644
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,051
Very good,
planting banana trees.

645
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:39,220
Can you do it?
How can I be of help?

646
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,798
I was looking
a costume for Junior.

647
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,560
For a school play.

648
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,701
Hey! I want to be attended to.

649
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:54,978
I can be in the school play with him.
Take a look, you'll find something.

650
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,576
You can have everything I have,
except the pocket knife.

651
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,448
It's a corkscrew too.

652
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,714
I'm General Avocado.

653
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,189
I'm organizing a revolution
in San Stevedore.

654
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,885
And I want a uniform
general immediately.

655
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,224
Will you take an army with you?

656
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,889
-Don't scream.
-Okay.

657
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,400
Why can't I pack uniforms
from the army too?

658
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,630
Can't start a war
with a suit and tie.

659
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,570
- It's an idea, but it should be quick.
-Okay.

660
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,334
We have it all, from start to finish.

661
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,410
-I sent two good armies to China.
-Okay.

662
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,101
What fraternity do they belong to?
Do you accept normal?

663
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,568
I have just the thing for them.

664
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,571
Alright, guys.
You can come in.

665
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,037
Wait a second.
There's no need to be in a hurry.

666
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,881
Dear sirs.

667
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,875
That's it, it fit like a glove.

668
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,539
You can see right away
that you are the leader.

669
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,945
Look at these medals.

670
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:36,306
Boss, you can't lose with this army.
They will scare away the enemy.

671
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,266
It's an inspiring sight.

672
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,505
I would like to go with you.
Courage is a wonderful thing.

673
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,979
My men are the most
brave of all.

674
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:47,483
They love the sound of the cannon.
We fear nothing.

675
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,392
-Wait. Let's celebrate.
-What?

676
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,133
-Heads or tails to see who pays.
-Right. You won't fool me.

677
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:11,969
-What do you have?
-Crown.

678
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,577
-Face.
-Face.

679
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,905
-You lost.
-You stay here.

680
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,412
We gave you an advantage
again.

681
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,483
Yes, sir, and I'm hungry,
I'm going to eat an ox.

682
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,947
I'm always unlucky.

683
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,146
Strange, I can't win
these two guys.

684
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,846
-Hey, let's go.
-Hey, let's go.

685
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,583
I'm paying,
I stay as long as I want.

686
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,160
-I am hungry!
-I repeat, I'm paying.

687
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,152
What are you waiting for?
Do you want me to starve?

688
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,788
-I'm not hungry.
-Well, I am.

689
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,030
Hello.

690
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,397
Have you ever heard an argument like that?

691
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,096
-A glass of water, I'm hungry.
-I'll keep this card.

692
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,536
Who serves here?

693
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,302
-What do you have?
-A ham sandwich.

694
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,003
-What kind?
-Aged meat.

695
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,609
-What kind of bread?
-"White in full".

696
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,682
-And you?
-Just dessert.

697
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:59,187
-What do you want?
-Bullshit and whipped cream.

698
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:03,287
I want liver and milk.
And bring me a banana split.

699
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:07,228
There's only one banana and
too old to cut in half.

700
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:10,164
Okay,
bring me baking soda.

701
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,665
It makes me hungry.

702
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,703
I want a bowl of soup
with nuts inside.

703
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,703
-You eat strange things.
-I'm paying.

704
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,740
There are always two sides to the coin,
right?

705
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:22,477
Look at me with the girls.
John J. Prosperity himself.

706
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,207
I just ordered the costumes
for the Firefighters Ball.

707
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,114
-I'm too much.
-That's wonderful.

708
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,481
And besides that,
The dance will be at Klein.

709
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,180
That's killing two birds
with one stone,

710
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,984
and I guarantee that I will go further.

711
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,420
You hate yourself, right?

712
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,459
-Well, I'm waiting.
-What?

713
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,359
That you ask me
to accompany her to the dance.

714
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,260
-Well, I'll just say it.
-Okay, I'll take Louise then.

715
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,528
-Remember that it is a commitment.
-Okay.

716
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,126
A commitment
It's a commitment.

717
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,137
-Don't forget, Ted.
-I won't forget.

718
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,344
Can I?

719
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,872
Come on, Louise,
he likes to pay for things.

720
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,972
Like costume shops,
for example.

721
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,909
Your half is not good alone.

722
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:04,181
It looks like we have
to leave them together.

723
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,790
Aren't you taking advantage?

724
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,154
But look how good they look.

725
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,989
I prefer to pay mine, thank you.

726
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:15,259
Hello, Carlson.

727
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,528
-Come on, sit down.
-Hello, Ted.

728
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,237
-What do you want?
-A roast beef sandwich.

729
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,397
-Roast beef.
-Roast beef.

730
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,565
You know, you're not a bad guy.

731
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,110
How kind.

732
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,440
You know I don't want to hurt
Louise and her uncle.

733
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,573
-You still like her, don't you?
-She's wonderful.

734
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,208
Wow, are you
in a snooker pool.

735
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,616
-What did you say you wanted?
-A roast beef sandwich.

736
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,518
-Roast beef.
-Roast beef.

737
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:41,284
I would give anything
if she came to the dance with me.

738
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,657
Wait. I invited Louise
to come to the dance with me.

739
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,763
-Did you invite?
-Yes, here's the idea.

740
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,459
You and I will wear the same costumes
and we change when dancing.

741
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,660
I will use one
fantasy like yours?

742
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,464
And I will take your place
with Louise.

743
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,337
-Why, certainly.
-Ted, you're sweet.

744
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,637
-What...
-The roast beef continues.

745
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,940
-Roast beef.
-Don't order roast beef, okay?

746
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,643
Put it back.

747
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,688
What do you think?
All day...

748
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,544
Louise.

749
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:38,978
Otto, how are you?

750
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,542
-Teddy, it's a wonderful opening.
-Wonderful opening.

751
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,278
Look here!

752
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,053
-One of my inventions.
-Very good.

753
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,391
With the coat and everything.

754
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,787
Come on, come in.
They haven't seen anything yet.

755
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,662
Come on, I'll show you everything,
my dear.

756
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,083
It's a funny thing.

757
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,888
Come on, are waiting
your presentation.

758
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,619
Otto, this is for you.

759
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,492
Okay, go ahead.

760
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,034
Now, out...
That's it.

761
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:40,505
<i>Cheer up and smile</i>

762
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:43,273
<i>Don't envy money</i>

763
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,111
<i>You have your inventions
And you have your health</i>

764

<i>Wealth means nothing,
believe</i>

765
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:55,089
<i>Don't envy the
rich man's wardrobe

766
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,494
<i>Two pants match

767
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:04,129
<i>Don't worry
Because you can only use

769
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,563
<i>Don't envy the rich sultan</i>

<i>Who has 100 divine women</i>

771

00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:13,100
-Well, Ted.
-It wasn't my intention. I don't...

787
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,968
It wasn't my intention.

788
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,337
Wait a minute.
It wasn't my intention.

789
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,277
I have something new.
It's a surprise for me too.

790
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:27,280
And next? Who are you?
What's your name?

791
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,386
-The Gig and Gag Trio.
-What?

792
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,284
-That's right.
-The boys started right away.

793
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,654
Come.
Here they are.

794
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,121
-Hi, Glen.
-How are you? How are you?

795
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,597
-What's your name, son?
-John O. David.

796
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,394
-What's your name, son?
-John O. David.

797
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,557
-John O. David. Is the "O" an abbreviation?
-Yes.

798
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,101
- "The" of what? Oscar?
-No.

799
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:46,226
-Otto?
-No.

800
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:47,327
-Oswald?
-No.

801
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:49,429
- "The" of what?
-Sydney.

802
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,872
Wait there.
Stop it.

803
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:52,943
-I'll take care of it.
-What's there?

804
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,034
-What's your name?
-George Washington.

805
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,374
You chose a good name.

806
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,574
It was you who knocked it down
the cherry tree?

807
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,878
No, a year and a half ago
I didn't work.

808
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:02,180
-I understand.
-Yes.

809
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:06,216
-Are you related?
-Yes, we are brothers.

810
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,724
They are brothers. And who is the oldest?
Who is the oldest in the family?

811
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,726
-My father.
-Ah, the father is the oldest. Of course.

812
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,298
Just a minute.
I have something to tell you.

813
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,698
-Choose a number from 1 to 10.
-What?

814
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,529
Choose a number from 1 to 10.

815
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,070
-Ready.
-What is it?

816
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,137
-Seven.
-Correct.

817
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,571
Wait a minute.

818
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:27,042
Do it again, I wasn't looking.
Come on, proceed.

819
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,771
Choose any number
from 1 to 10.

820
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:29,903
-Ready.
-What is it?

821
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:30,981
-Two.
-Correct.

822
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,748
Wait a minute.
Choose a number from 1 to 10.

823
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,017
-Ready.
-What is it?

824
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,091
Two.

825
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,558
I was wrong, it was four.
Enough with this nonsense.

826
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,092
Get out of here!

827
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,793
-Here it is. From the platoon.
-What is it?

828
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,524
A letter of recommendation.

829
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,069
-Can I read it?
-Yes.

830
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,571
"Dear Ted, I want to introduce
three charming boys.

831
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,768
"These guys are very smart.
I hope to hear from you again.

832
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:02,278
"In a thoughtful way."
Signed: "Sincerely."

833
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,414
-Who wrote this?
-I.

834
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,476
-Okay, this is the song.
-What song?

835
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,952
-It gives a high pitch.
-He wants a high pitch.

836
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,547
Don't worry.
It will give a high pitch.

837
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:17,491
<i>My girlfriend
her name is Nelly</i>

838
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:18,584
Are you singing this?

839
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:22,530
<i>Nelly is very sweet</i>

840
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:25,068
<i>Nelly asks
my advice in everything</i>

841
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,136
From platoon A.

842
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:29,171
<i>Nelly adores me</i>

843
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:30,365
<i>L�, l�, l�</i>

844
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:34,669
Okay, that's enough.
I sing a "la, la, la."

845
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,509
I sing a "la, la, la."
Proceed. Proceed.

846
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,275
-Can you give the grade?
-He will.

847
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:43,182
<i>My girlfriend
her name is Nelly</i>

848
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:44,277
That's it.

849
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,878
<i>Nelly is very sweet...</i>

850
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:47,354
Take it or I'll break it
your face!

851
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:48,491
Well, I...

852
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,189
Calm down, guys.

853
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:52,421
Enough with that.

854
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:56,090
I can't help it, go on.

855
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,830
<i>Nelly asks my advice
at all</i>

856
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:03,166
<i>Nelly adores me</i>

00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,240
<i>L�, l�, l�...</i>

858
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,535
I will sing.

859
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,610
Give me that.

860
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:08,678
Can you sing?

861
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,507
-Can I correct you?
-Yes.

862
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,843
I will sing.
A treble please.

863
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,417
<i>My girlfriend
her name is Nelly</i>

864
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,716
<i>Nelly is very sweet</i>

865
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,057
<i>Nelly asks...</i>

866
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,493
Here, boys.
Learn from the leader.

867
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,495
<i>My girlfriend
her name is Nelly</i>

868
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,363

<i>Nelly me...</i>

871
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:35,831
There, there...

872
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,235
Wait. No need...
Hold on, boys.

873
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,175
Wait. All good.
Enough with that.

874
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,646
-Wait one moment.
-What's the problem?

875
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,716
I lost my fraternity pin.

876
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:48,318
I really lost.

877
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:49,385
-Proceed.
-Finish.

878
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:50,748
-I can't hear.
-Finish.

879
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,618
Good,
I can't understand this.

880
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,817
-I don't understand.
-He doesn't know the "bullshit".

881
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:55,949
-What?
-The "bullshit".

882
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,117
The "bullshit"?

883
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,262
No, he means the "letter".
The letter.

884
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,156
I know what I mean.

885
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,266
What are you telling me?

886
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,927
What do you think of this guy here?
I composed the song.

887
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,704
I composed the song and the guy...

888
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,796
Now.
What's the matter with you?

889
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,341
Do you like this guy?

890
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,443
Now.

891
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,043
I didn't say anything.
I am here...

892
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,445
Wait!
Wait!

893
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,385
Stop shouting.
Here, please.

894
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,488
You're from the tip, come here.

895
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,352
Hey, what do you do?
What do you do, son?

896
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,017
-I'm a dancer.
-What?

897
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:32,186
-Yes. A dancer.
-Ah, are you a dancer?

898
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,455
-Are you mad at me?
-No.

899
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,293
What kind of dance
will you do?

900
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:37,629
-The elevator dance.
-The elevator dance?

901
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,930
A little music and I'll start.

902
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,005
It will start.
Do you mean start dancing?

903
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,733
Come on,
Give him a high note.

904
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,837
The elevator dance.

905
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,149
Guys, wait.

906
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,855
What is this?
What is this you are doing?

907
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,515
-The elevator dance.
-What?

908
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,523
-The elevator dance.
-The elevator dance?

909
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:03,923
There are no steps.

910
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,119
I'll give you some steps.

911
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,663
Get out of here.

912
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:12,926
Get out of here.

913
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,938
Wait a little.
Wait a little.

914
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,699
Wait a little.

915
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,571
Now, folks,
everyone dancing.

916
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,268
Don't forget, dance.

917
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,080
Hi, Ted.

918
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:33,620
Here we are,
the same fantasy.

919
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:38,389
Dance now with Louise.
She's right there.

920
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,730
This is where you come in.

921
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:45,559
Wait a minute, you left me
in a snooker pool.

922
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:48,434
Everything you do,
will be used against me.

923
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,872
-Good luck.
-Thanks, Ted.

924
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:00,043
-Ah, Ted, do you want to dance with me?
-Why, of course.

925
00:57:00,284 --> 00:57:02,753
Nothing like a good
and old waltz.

926
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,819
-What are you laughing at?
-It's tickling me.

927
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,654
Am I bothering you?

928
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,225
is the foxtrot,
don't be in a hurry.

929
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:20,467
-Get off my back.
-You're on top of mine, aren't you?

930
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,868
-Now yes.
-You've arrived at your station, get off.

931
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,805
Got a one-way ticket
and you want a round trip?

932
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,467
Release the left side.

933
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,374
There's a corner there, let's go there.

934
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,645
-Here you go, Ted.
-Hello.

935
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,384
-Do you want to dance?
-Let's skip this one.

936
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,820
What do you mean by stepping
at my Ted's feet?

937
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,497
Please listen, Louise.

938
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,968
I organized this with Ted
just to be close to you.

939
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,754
Ladies and gentlemen,

940
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,989
one of the boys from
fire department.

941
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:14,809
-Hey, what's there?
-A little surprise for the boss.

942
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,682
She turns 46 today,
Let's have a little party.

943
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:23,522
-Wish me happiness.
-Thank you, certainly.

944
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:34,104
Hey, why don't you look
where are you going?

945
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,172
Look what you did.
He ruined the birthday cake.

946
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,108
Louise, you need to listen to me.

947
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,333
Go away.

948
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,543
Fire.

949
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,516
Fire! Help, police!
Fire!

950
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,863
Fire!
Where are you?

951
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,997
There.
Let's go!

952
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,783
-It's all planned out, boys.
-Wait a minute.

953
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:05,123
-What's the problem?
-Where is the fire?

954
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:09,262
-That's right. Where is the fire?
-I hadn't thought.

955
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,524
Well, I don't know.

956
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:13,569
There it is.

957
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:23,513
Come on, boys.

958
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,722
What's your problem?

959
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:39,458
You can't iron your pants without
for the fire department to intervene?

960
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:41,023
You can't iron your pants without
for the fire department to intervene?

961
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,198
Sorry. We deceive ourselves.
I am really sorry.

962
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:48,600
-There's no fire there.
-They can't do that. Hey!

963
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,998
They forgot one here!

964
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:22,768
-But I'm crazy about you.
-Shut up and go away.

965
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:25,532
Please, Louise, open the door.
I can explain everything.

966
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,614
Here it is!
There!

967
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,729
Position the jet in the east window
in that hole!

968
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:52,802
Come on, boys!

969
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,030
Open the water!

970
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:57,736
Come on, turn on the water!

971
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,741
Fill that hose with water!

972
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:03,073
Hey, you big head,
it has the same hose.

973
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,146
Come here!

974
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,682
Who is pulling this?
What's your problem?

975
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,343
Get the other hose, let's go!

976
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,425
Straighten up there!

977
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:23,065
Hey, from one boss to another.
Why do you have two nozzles?

978
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,292
I'm in a hurry.

979
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,295
Are you in a hurry, how about that?

980
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:28,667
What are you doing standing there?
Go there. Go.

981
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:33,972
Okay, let's go.

982
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:36,838
Get that hose.

983
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,883
Let's take a hose
inside.

984
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,315
What's the problem with the water?

985
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,112
Help, guys!

986
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:45,221
Get out of the way!

987
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,049
Come on, send more water
inside.

988
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,625
Who donated this hose?

989
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,625
What are you doing?
Strangle it?

990
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,189
Send water inside.
As...

991
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:53,592
Throw the water!

992
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:55,961
-Help! Boys!
-A distressed voice!

993
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,898
-Help!
-Let's rescue him!

994
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:58,968
Forward!

995
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,581
I'll take care of you, boy,
Calm down now.

996
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,445
Careful, boy. Are you injured?
Talk to me.

997
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:19,045
Talk to me. Come on.
I was on the work team.

998
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,123
I will make sure you receive a medal,
talk to me.

999
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,023
Call a doctor! What are you looking at?
Someone call a doctor.

1000
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,322
What's the problem?

1001
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:28,489
It's my friend,
do something for him.

1002
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:33,560
He's in bad shape.
I think he's going to die.

1003
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,129
No, I'm fine.

1004
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:38,263
Lay down, want to do
the doctor for a fool?

1005
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,069
-You, see. Why not...
-Wait a minute.

1006
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,472
Can I help?
It must have been something I ate.

1007
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,242
Well, stop eating nonsense
and come help here, okay?

1008
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,653
Cool, guys.
This way. Come on.

1009
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,190
Everyone there.

1010
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,095
That's it.

1011
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:00,996
All.

1012
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,668
Let's go!
Squirt the water!

1013
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:17,813
SMOKING PROHIBITED

1014
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,479
Don't know how to read?

1015
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,279
What do you want to do? Start a fire?
Take this.

1016
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:27,017
Here it is!

1017
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,354
Where are you going?
What's the problem...

1018
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:30,426
Who sent you here?

1019
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,552
The problem is here,
at that door. Let's go!

1020
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,858
-Someone needs to come in.
-Come on, break down the door.

1021
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,626
Between. That's it.
Get out of there, boy.

1022
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:39,896
-Get your face out of there.
-Careful!

1023
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:42,729
Come on, brave men,
Let's go in, won't we?

1024
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,601
-What are we going to do? Right.
-Let's throw.

1025
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,641
-You can't bluff me.
-Okay...

1026
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,140
Proceed.
Take a coin.

1027
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,211
-What do you have?
-Crown.

1028
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,279
-Face.
-Face.

1029
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,370
-You lost.
-Between.

1030
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,677
-You took advantage last time.
-Yes I know...

1031
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:55,846
We'll be waiting here!

1032
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,016
-There you go.
-Platoon A.

1033
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,556
He caught her.
He caught her.

1034
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,155
Are you okay, miss?

1035
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:07,488
You take care of him.
I take care of myself.

1036
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:09,132
-Well, I don't believe it...
-Get out of the way.

1037
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:10,324
What are you doing here?

1038
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,834
-You don't know anything?
-Come on, get out of here! Get out of here!

1039
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:19,032
Bring the hose here,
boys.

1040
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,004
Come here, boys.

1041
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:25,444
Come on, boys!

1042
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,472
He passed out.
What do we do now?

1043
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,712
With one less player,
It's better to draw some cards.

1044
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,218
-Okay!
-Good idea.

1045
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:35,516
Hey, let's go!
Come on, get out of here!

1046
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,185
The place is on fire!
What's the matter with you?

1047
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,626
Are you crazy?
The place is on fire.

1048
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:45,795
Bring the artificial respirator.

1049
01:06:45,902 --> 01:06:46,869
Here.

1050
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,062
Bring an artificial respirator.

1051
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,868
Stay away!
Stay away!

1052
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,706
-Louise!
-Stay away. What's up?

1053
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:56,477
Well, this now!
How do you...

1054
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,276
All good. I'll take care of it.
Stand still for a minute.

1055
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,577
Let me position.

1056
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,844
It's not me who's bad.

1057
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:04,010
What was wrong was that way.
I need to look for it.

1058
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,181
Hey, make up your mind soon!

1059
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:11,852
I'm not your personal firefighter.

1060
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,158
This time I'll take you outside,
stay out! You, come here.

1061
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,661
How about that?
It's this guy's 2nd time.

1062
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,702
What do you think?

1063
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,203
Hey, bring the artificial respirator here!
Here's the guy!

1064
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:27,610
Come back, come back.

1065
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:33,214
Wait one moment.
Don't worry, Louise, I got you.

1066
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,075
Got you.
Don't worry.

1067
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,618
I'm taking them one at a time.
You know that, don't you?

1068
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,486
Stay away!
Keep your distance.

1069
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,754
Make space for them.
Make space.

1070
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:46,386
How is he?
Is he okay?

1071
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:49,557
-Get us out of here.
-Stay away.

1072
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,945
Louise! Louise!
Let me in!

1073
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,850
Okay, come in.

1074
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,814
-Are you okay?
-Yes, and you?

1075
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,249
What are you doing here?
Are you a firefighter?

1076
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,329
Where's your badge?

1077
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:25,565
Wow, it's the costume store.

1078
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:27,868
Louise, are you okay?

1079
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:30,702
Uncle Otto,
the store is destroyed.

1080
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:34,674
Don't worry, Mr. Schmidt.
I insured the store in your name.

1081
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:35,835
In my name?

1082
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,970
Yes. And the guy who bought it
all Ted's fantasies

1083
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:39,845
He was Richard's lawyer.

1084
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,848
My goodness!

1085
01:08:46,022 --> 01:08:48,753
Give me that thing.
See Look.

1086
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:57,430
-Hey, are you okay?
-At least I've been in a real fire.

1087
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,627
-I'm glad you weren't hurt.
-It was a brand.

1088
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:01,065
Come on, Gus.

1089
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,239
What is it?
What do you want?

1090
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:07,776
My son-in-law's boat is
arriving with a load.

1091
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,777
I received new merchandise.

1092
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:14,350
Well, let's go.

1093
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,445
Hey, Ted, are you coming?

1094
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,887
Did you hear the bells?
Don't you come?

1095
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,188
The only bell he will hear
Now it's the wedding bells.

1096
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,887
-Good luck.
-You will need it.

1097
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:27,997
Alright, boys!

1098
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,236
Go back there.

1099
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,865
What's in this thing?
Let me see. Yes.
