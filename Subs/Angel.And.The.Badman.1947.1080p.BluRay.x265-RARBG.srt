1
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,399
Give me that horse.

2
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:46,999
He couldn't go on,
nor could you.

3
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,899
You're injured, man.
Let us take you into the house.

4
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:54,599
I gotta go on. Gotta get to
the Telegraph station.

5
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,399
We'll take you.
Penelope!

6
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,101
Sorry, closed down for the night.

7
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,701
I know, but this is urgent...

8
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:00,101
No. Come out of there, you!

9
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,101
Can't go against the schedule.
Closed down.

10
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:04,101
Can't you make this one exception?
- No.

11
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:05,501
Get in here.
- What?

12
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,701
Bring a light with you.

13
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,701
You can't do this to me.
I won't stand for it!

14
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,901
The Union Pacific
won't stand for it.

15
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,901
Night prowling round here,
like this.

16
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,701
You've got your gall busting
into my office.

17
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:20,301
Who do you think you're anyway?
My key's closed down for tonight.

18
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,701
You can write it,
but I won't send it anyway.

19
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,101
Here, let me!

20
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:31,002
<i>Territorial Recorders office,
Fort Lacey.</i>

21
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:34,652
<i>have filed corner stakes...</i>

22
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:41,002
<i>...on plots 234... 235.</i>

23
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:46,902
<i>Chart 1089,
record in my name...</i>

24
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:49,902
...that's all.
- How shall I sign it?

25
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:51,602
<i>Quirt Evans.</i>

26
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,503
All sent, Mr. Evans.

27
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,503
Why! He ain't dead, is he?

28
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,603
No just knocked out!

29
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:51,304
That's Quirt Evans...

30
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:55,304
Look at his gun, see how many
notches he has got in his gun?

31
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:59,604
Not any that I can see.
Sure ain't going to touch it to find out

32
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,504
might wake up and
take it the wrong way.

33
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,804
he was deputy of Wyatt Earp
in Tombstone.

34
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:08,804
...the two of them shot it out
with the whole Clanton bunch.

35
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,504
So, that's Quirt Evans...

36
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,704
...he's quite a man
with the gals...

37
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:17,904
.it says he closed the eyes
of many a man

38
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:20,004
...opened the eyes
of many a women.

39
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:23,104
Would you call
my father please?

40
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,604
Yes! ma'am...

41
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:34,905
Where are you taking him?
- To the wagon, to take him home.

42
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:37,505
Quirt Evans?
Crazy!

43
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,805
I'd just a soon have a black powder
bomb in my house.

44
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,005
Heavy, ain't he?

45
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,705
I know of a dozen men
who'd ride night and day

46
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,705
...to catch Quirt Evans
helpless like this.

47
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:53,605
I'm worried about you people...

48
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,905
...I know you don't believe in guns or
anything like that, only doing good.

49
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:58,505
Take my advice...

50
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:01,305
I'd stay plenty far away
from Mr. Quirt Evans.

51
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:04,305
Thank you very much for your advice.
Goodnight.

52
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,705
Good night.

53
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,106
So long, Quirt.

54
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,006
That Quirt Evans
is surely something.

55
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:17,906
Quirt Evans?
You know him?

56
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:21,906
Do I know Quirt Evans?
Do I know Quirt Evans!

57
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:24,306
What a question!

58
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:31,406
Quirt: No... No...

59
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:34,206
If that doesn't quiet him...
I don't know what will?

60
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:37,306
...never get that bullet out of him
kicking around like that.

61
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:40,606
I'm afraid to give him any more sedative,
he has already had enough.

62
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,206
Please be quiet...
the doctor...

63
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:43,706
He can't hear you.

64
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:47,006
What do you suppose that
delirious mind is searching for?

65
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:49,906
He must be in great pain.
- Not with that much laudanum in him.

66
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:54,507
As if he was reaching for something.
Something specific.

67
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,007
I don't understand. By now he
should be completely inert.

68
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:01,707
Quirt: No.

69
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,707
Thomas, how is the young man?
- Delirious.

70
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:41,608
A gun in this house, Thomas?

71
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,208
Please put these back in the gun belt...

72
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,508
Maybe we'll have to get something
to tie him down.

73
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:56,608
Are you crazy?
- It's empty.

74
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,008
That was it. A gun.
- It's a pity.

75
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:07,208
It's stupid! These wild ones,
I keep picking bullets out of them,

76
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,708
...and setting their bones, why?

77
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,509
It's their destiny to wind up on Boot Hill.

78
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:13,709
No!

79
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:18,309
I forgot! Never speak evil, eh!

80
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,909
Well, get me some more hot water,
young lady.

81
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,609
Start patching him up for
whatever is in store for him.

82
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:30,409
Come on, help me with his boots.

83
00:09:50,109 --> 00:09:52,209
Mother...
- Yes?

84
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,210
Tell me again.

85
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,210
What, Dear?
- Oh, about meeting father.

86
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,510
Thee have heard that
a thousand times.

87
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,610
He was working on the roof of
the new meeting house.

88
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,610
...he fell off, and I picked him up
out of the dust and held him in my arms.

89
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,010
He always said that I hugged him
before I even knew his name.

90
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,210
And you both knew right away?
- Of course.

91
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,110
Of course I knew he
was a peaceful man....

92
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,610
...a member of the society.

93
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,310
An evil man will seek a more profitable
way of life

94
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,810
<i>...than being a member
of the "Friends".</i>

95
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,811
Father had a beard then, didn't he?
- Yes.

96
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:38,211
I should think that
would scratch...

97
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:41,411
I prefer a man clean shaved.

98
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:49,111
He's got the constitution of a
mountain lion. He'll pull through.

99
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,311
Barring blood poisoning.

100
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:54,411
These wild ones never seem
to get blood poisoning...

101
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:56,811
...though it's common enough
among the Godly.

102
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:01,211
You so called Atheists. You always feel
so compelled to stretch your Godlessness.

103
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,411
Wash him.
The bullet's out.

104
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:09,811
He's in no danger.

105
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:13,511
I bet he killed a lot of people.
- No, he didn't.

106
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,512
How do thee know?
- That's enough, John...

107
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,912
<i>...a "friend" doesn't speak
of such things.</i>

108
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,812
Mrs. Worth, get that
man out of here.

109
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,612
But he's badly injured,
doctor.

110
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,412
This isn't civilized Pennsylvania...

111
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:30,912
...this is the raw frontier.
You must take a realistic attitude.

112
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:34,112
This is the place where mayhem, theft
and murder are the common place...

113
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:35,512
...instead of the unusual.

114
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,912
Would that justify leaving
a wounded man to die?

115
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:41,712
Build your house by the side of the road
and be a friend to man.

116
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:44,312
Ye who believe.

117
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,912
I don't mind your mocking us,
you've been a good friend to us.

118
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,712
I'm glad I have
a logical mind.

119
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:52,412
And a good heart.
Goodnight, doctor.

120
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,712
Goodnight.

121
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:03,713
Still having delirious spells.
Keeps mumbling about his past.

122
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:08,813
...I'm afraid he's had
a very violent life.

123
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:13,813
[Quirt mumbling]:
Cards...

124
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:17,813
...cover my bet on the black ace...

125
00:12:22,813 --> 00:12:24,813
...you're a shapely hussy...

126
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,813
...you get real conformation, Margaret...

127
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:35,313
...you fill out that dress just right...

128
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,314
...red's your color...

129
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:42,314
...alright Margaret...

130
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,714
...chart 1089...

131
00:12:47,214 --> 00:12:48,714
...1089...

132
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:53,814
...Margaret, you're a nuisance!
Let's call it off, Margaret...

133
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:57,814
...I've got places to go and
country to put behind...

134
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:01,014
...sure, sure, alright...

135
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,234
...Lila... Lila...

136
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:14,514
...Lila..

137
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:23,515
...if I owned a mint...
put your head on every coin...

138
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:28,515
...I use to smoke corn silk
when I was a kid...

139
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,515
...your hair is just like that, Lila...

140
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:39,515
...lite brown, yellow all mixed up...
just like corn silk, Lila...

141
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,515
...all gold...
taunt...

142
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,215
Will you bring some
hot coffee, Penny?

143
00:13:55,215 --> 00:13:58,015
Here, the doctor says that he's
completely out of danger.

144
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,416
Just sleeping.
You know, Doctor...

145
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,516
...Penny considers him her
own personal patient.

146
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:03,516
Sit down.

147
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,016
Will you bring some milk, dear?

148
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:06,816
And when you finish you can
go up and watch him...

149
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,316
while you card your
wool on the loon.

150
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:12,216
He doesn't need watching. He has no
temperature in the past few days.

151
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,616
...just a superlatively healthy animal.

152
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:18,486
...restoring his depleted strength with
sleep. He's no longer delirious.

153
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:21,346
But of course, if you're determined
to watch over him, Penny...

154
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,616
...perhaps you better take a
pencil and paper with you.

155
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,846
His first conscious words
should be recorded.

156
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:27,546
It may be of great interest
to history.

157
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:30,806
And more possibly to
the United States Marshal.

158
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:35,906
Who knows what violence is involved
with his battered frame and bullet holes.

159
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:37,786
Would you care for a donut, doctor?

160
00:14:38,186 --> 00:14:40,067
They're not as light as it should be.
- Listen, Mrs. Worth...

161
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:43,147
...you can carry this
head-in-sand attitude

162
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,147
just so far in the
world of reality.

163
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:47,617
Let me get this man
out of your house.

164
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,897
I can dump him in an establishment
that passes for a hotel...

165
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:53,337
...in this oft times dubious
community of ours.

166
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:57,317
In Madame Sanitary hobble?
- Then he will be off your hands.

167
00:14:57,617 --> 00:15:00,217
But he's much better off here
- Of course he is.

168
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:03,417
Who cares what happens to him?
- We do.

169
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,717
I don't know what to say.

170
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,617
Once, when I was studying
medicine in Europe...

171
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,417
...I had a friend,
an artist.

172
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:16,517
He drew portraits of people
and made them...

173
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:18,517
resemble the animals
they reminded him of.

174
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:22,218
He would have drawn this man
as a coiled cobra.

175
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:27,418
Doctor, your analogy's terribly imperfect
and your naturalism faulted.

176
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:30,018
Cobras don't coil.

177
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:35,818
Doctor, we are so fond of thee
and we respect you so greatly.

178
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:40,218
We assured that you
will finally realize...

179
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:42,818
...that realism untempered by
sentiments of humanity

180
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,318
...is really just a mean hard cold
outlook on life.

181
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:48,018
A frightened outlook.

182
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,318
I stand defeated.

183
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:58,118
And furthermore, there are
times in this house...

184
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:01,118
...that I feel as if I'm living in
a never never land.

185
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,319
But don't hesitate to call on me
anytime you need help.

186
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:36,419
Hello.

187
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:41,619
You're awake?
- Sure, I'm awake.

188
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,220
What is all this?
- What?

189
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,120
Where am I?

190
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,620
Don't you remember? Father and I
drove you into town.

191
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,220
Is anything wrong?
- No.

192
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,320
The doctor says you will be alright
in a week or two.

193
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,720
You were delirious, you know?
Two days and two nights.

194
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,421
Oh, maybe that's why
I'm so hungry.

195
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:29,121
I could eat a yearling steer...

196
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,121
...if I can catch one.

197
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,321
We will get you something.

198
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,721
Mother!
You talked a lot in your delirium.

199
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:42,721
Mother, he's awake.
- How is he?

200
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:43,421
Hungry!

201
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,921
If he's hungry,
he's going to be alright.

202
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,321
Thanks a lot for housing.
- You're welcome.

203
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,521
Smoked sausages and eggs?

204
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:56,721
Sounds great.
- 2 eggs or would you like 3?

205
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:59,921
I would like 6.
- Ye shall have them.

206
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,922
Penny, get one of your father's
shirts here, and a razor.

207
00:18:05,522 --> 00:18:07,222
I'll go get him some food...

208
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:14,522
So I talked a lot?
- Yes.

209
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:16,522
I listened only because
I thought that you might

210
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:18,522
say something that would
aide us in helping you.

211
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,922
Notifying your wife,
for instance.

212
00:18:20,922 --> 00:18:23,022
What did I say?
- If you had a wife.

213
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:25,022
What did I talk about?

214
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,722
You talked of Margaret,
she...

215
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,422
...filled out a red dress...

216
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,422
What else?

217
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:37,622
<i>Oh, you mentioned someone
named "Lila".</i>

218
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:40,122
Is that all?

219
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,622
If you have a wife,
we could notify her.

220
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,322
No wife.

221
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:51,703
That's 12.

222
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,963
I haven't been so flattered
since my donuts...

223
00:18:55,063 --> 00:18:57,063
won first prize at the fair
back in Pennsylvania.

224
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,813
They must be smart
in Pennsylvania.

225
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:02,553
Some of the members thought it's an
exhibition of pride to enter my donuts.

226
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,043
But what harm can there be
in a little donut...

227
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,343
...unless, one eats so many
of them they explode,

228
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,143
which is likely to happen
to you, young man.

229
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:11,673
Well, there's worse ways
of checking out.

230
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:14,723
I'll help you with the dishes.
- No, you stay and watch Quirt Evans.

231
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:18,013
I'm curious to know
the effect of 6 eggs,

232
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,013
a pound of sausage
and 12 donuts.

233
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:22,433
I'll call thee in
time for the milking.

234
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,544
Do all you people from Pennsylvania
talk like that?

235
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:30,094
Like what?

236
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,324
<i>"Thee."</i>

237
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,864
<i>We're "Friends".</i>

238
00:19:35,494 --> 00:19:37,414
<i>"Friends" of who?
- Of all.</i>

239
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:40,124
<i>The society of "Friends".
Many people call us "Quakers".</i>

240
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,604
Oh! It's a religion.
- It's a belief.

241
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,224
That on the wall...

242
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:50,324
<i>"Each human being has an
integrity that can be hurt only...</i>

243
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,624
<i>..."by the act of that
same human being.</i>

244
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,024
<i>"And not by the act of
another human being."</i>

245
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:56,924
Is that Quaker stuff?

246
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:00,124
You mean nobody can
hurt you but yourself?

247
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:02,124
<i>That's what the "Friends" believe.</i>

248
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:05,424
Well suppose somebody whacks you
over the head with a branding iron...

249
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:08,325
...won't that hurt?
- Physically, of course.

250
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,825
But in reality, it would injure only the
person doing the act of force or violence.

251
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,825
Only the doer can be hurt by
an evil or mean act.

252
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,925
Are there many of you Quakers?
- Very few.

253
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,325
Sort of figured that.

254
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,026
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

255
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,926
Carrot from our garden.

256
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,926
I found these out
at the road.

257
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,226
<i>It belongs to a fella
named "Quirt Evans".</i>

258
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:04,426
I understand you're
a friend of his,

259
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:05,926
maybe you can see to it
he gets them back...

260
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:07,726
Leave it here. I'll make sure
that he gets them.

261
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:11,526
That Quirt, he'd lose his shirt
if it wasn't buttoned on.

262
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:13,726
...careless about everything.

263
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:17,126
I keep telling him,
sooner or later.....

264
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:23,456
On second thought you can just
tell me where he's, and..

265
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:27,646
I can take it on back to him, myself.
Where is Quirt Evans?

266
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:30,577
You mean where is he?

267
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:34,197
Ever notice how fella keep
repeating the question,

268
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:35,997
when he's stalling
about answering.

269
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,687
Yeah! Maybe if I bend this gun over
his head, he'll quit stalling.

270
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:42,237
But gentlemen,
I hardly know Quirt Evans.

271
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:44,187
He lies, too.

272
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:47,347
You've been bragging all over town
of what good friends you two are.

273
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,227
You know, this fella ain't got
many good qualities, has he?

274
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,797
Sit down, friend.

275
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,827
Maybe that will help your memory.
I'm asking about Quirt Evans.

276
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:57,487
Well, all I know is...

277
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,068
Thanks for sewing the shirt...

278
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:19,138
...but I can't find my pants.

279
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,328
Get back in bed.

280
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:23,008
Laziness is the only thing
that's kept me there this long.

281
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,248
The doctor said that you're to stay
in bed 4 more days.

282
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:28,138
Oye, you're up.

283
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:29,988
That's no way to speak
to an older person, John.

284
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,128
We're pals...

285
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:34,008
<i>...you wouldn't expect a pal
to call me "Mister", would you?</i>

286
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:38,118
See, doctor said to tell you that some
men in town are looking for you.

287
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,758
Said one of them is
a Mister Laredo Stevens.

288
00:22:43,938 --> 00:22:45,568
Get my pants.
- But your leg.

289
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,368
Johnny, get me my pants.
- No, John.

290
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:48,838
Will thee get my pants?

291
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,459
Get the pants,
John.

292
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,199
But you said...

293
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,519
What are you looking at?
- Thee.

294
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,259
Oh boy, it's a good thing
I'm not a tattletale.

295
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,229
What set him off?

296
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,479
"Thee" is a familiar term.
- The what?

297
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,579
<i>The familiar, the plain language.
"Get thee my pants," ye said.</i>

298
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:25,639
What about it?

299
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:28,429
<i>Oh, among us, "thee" and "thou" are used
only among the loved ones.</i>

300
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:31,299
<i>...to all others, we use
"You, he, and they"</i>

301
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,280
...mother to children, husband to wife
and children to...

302
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,320
Between lovers of course.

303
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,850
I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

304
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,090
What?

305
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,590
I'm not! I wished thee would
speak that way to me.

306
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,060
Well.

307
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,000
I knew right away.
That night.

308
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,181
It's supposed to be
a dull kind of life.

309
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,611
I could take you
a lot of places...

310
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,371
I'd go.
- What?

311
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:20,281
I would rather stay
here with thee

312
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:23,671
but if thee rather go someplace else,
then I would go someplace else.

313
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:29,991
I sound very bold?

314
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:32,871
Well, it's just that...

315
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:38,601
...I didn't think religious people
were quite so, sudden and direct...

316
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,131
Well that's the way I feel and it would
be dishonest to say anything else.

317
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:45,641
Yeah!

318
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:50,121
I used to wonder about it,
I suppose every girl does.

319
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:52,051
About what?

320
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:53,982
About love......

321
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:58,072
About whether or not you got to know
someone whom you know a little by little

322
00:24:58,352 --> 00:24:59,882
...or it happened at once...

323
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:02,302
Thee are shocked....

324
00:25:03,792 --> 00:25:07,722
Well, I wouldn't say shocked exactly....

325
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:13,342
...you sure get to the point.
- Should I be different?

326
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:16,452
No, Penny, I like you
just the way you are.

327
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:20,162
Who emptied this gun?
- Father.

328
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:27,192
Quirt, a gun is a symbol of force, evil.
We never have one in our home.

329
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,252
It's a concession that father
allowed even an empty one.

330
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:33,572
It's only because you couldn't rest without...
- Where are the cartridges?

331
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:35,573
Outside.

332
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,323
Hey! Why don't we
just bust in?

333
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:56,283
Because busting through doors with
Quirt Evans on the other side,

334
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,793
...ain't my idea
of a healthy past time.

335
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,223
<i>Tell them to "come in".</i>

336
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:10,883
<i>"Come in."</i>

337
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,224
You can stand right there.

338
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,144
...against the light.

339
00:26:21,904 --> 00:26:23,024
Howdy, Quirt.

340
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:27,794
You sure ran a ring
around me alright.

341
00:26:29,104 --> 00:26:31,484
I don't think it was right
friendly of you to beat me

342
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:33,814
..to locating that tract
after my boys found it.

343
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,844
I'm willing to listen
to your side of it,

344
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,094
I'm a reasonable man.

345
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:41,174
Sure, Laredo is always reasonable.

346
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:43,184
That's why he's the biggest man
in the territory.

347
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:46,104
You're the biggest man
in the territory, Laredo?

348
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,154
So a lot of people say.
- I hadn't heard.

349
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,954
You nervous?
- No, Evans.

350
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:57,715
I can't figure out why you keep
stepping on my toes all the time...

351
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,675
But, that's your business.

352
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:01,775
I'm a good loser.

353
00:27:02,595 --> 00:27:04,015
...I like a good loser.

354
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,025
Course I like any kind of loser
better than a winner.

355
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:07,535
...yeah!

356
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:09,825
You know I had a chance to
do a heap of thinking

357
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:11,825
while I was following your
trail across the territory.

358
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:15,415
I followed it by the string of
ran out horses you left behind....

359
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,715
Well, I figured it out this way.

360
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,075
Quirt don't really
want that land.

361
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,415
Because working isn't
exactly in his line.

362
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,225
[Quirt]:
Is it in your line?

363
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:28,225
No, of course not. I was getting
it for another fella.

364
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:31,185
And well, I figured maybe you'll sell.

365
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:33,865
I don't hear anything jingle.

366
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,326
Is it alright to put my hand
inside my shirt?

367
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,596
Why not?

368
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:47,196
$5,000 in gold there.

369
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,436
I want 20.

370
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:54,666
Well okay, but I have to owe you 15,
that's all I got on me.

371
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,476
I have the deed in my pocket, here.
- Get it out.

372
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:03,406
Now, if the young lady could find us
something to sign this with.

373
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:13,236
Still Laredo's hired boy,
eh, Hondo?

Picking up after him,
carrying matches for his cigars.

375
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:20,707
You mind yourself.
- He'll mind himself...

376
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:23,167
... Won't you Hondo?
- Miss...

377
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:26,197
..Would you mind taking this over
to Mister Evans, please?

378
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:43,197
Thank you.

379
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:46,667
You know, I'm sure glad to see
you up and around, Quirt...

380
00:28:47,597 --> 00:28:49,427
...we heard you were
flat on your back.

381
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:51,407
Sorry to disappoint you.

382
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,767
You come on over and get the
rest of that money anytime.

383
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:57,737
Anytime that is that you feel
you're able.

384
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,548
I'll see you one
of these days.

385
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:03,378
Well... ah,
so long, Quirt.

386

Saddle up my horse, will you kid?
Throw on my war bags.

387
00:29:31,768 --> 00:29:33,898
What would have happened if they
knew the gun was empty?

388
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,448

Sorry.
- Oh, no, Quirt, no.

391
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,339
What kind of a boarder
do you think I am?

392
00:29:52,339 --> 00:29:56,479
You can't do that. We'd have tended
any wounded human, and not for pay.

393
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,389
You don't believe in force, so you
can't force me to take it back.

394

I'm afraid you're outwitted,
Thomas.

395

How long I have been here?
- Almost 3 weeks.

396
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,169
Kinda hate to get going.

397
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,709
But you can't. Your leg!
You are in no condition to travel.

398
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,139
Don't worry, your cooking has me
grained up and ready for market.

Shall I pack my things?

402
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,020
Why?
- Thee leave without me?

I got places to go...

404

any difference to me how far...

I know so little...
I.....

to one and not the other.

happened to both.

Say, wasn't this place irrigated?

465
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:10,097
I see all these flumes
and ditches.

466
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:12,417
Frederick Carson
turned the water off.

467
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:13,587
Frederick Carson?

468
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,797
He's the man who bought
the ranch up above from the friends

469
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:18,397
who couldn't make a go of it.

470
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:22,327
We had built a community dam,
but... It was on his property.

471
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:26,357
Whatcha you do about it?
Don't tell me. You prayed.

472
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,797
Of course.
- Getcha any water?

473
00:35:29,487 --> 00:35:34,157
We didn't pray for water.
We prayed for Frederick Carson.

474
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:38,987
Carson turned off the water
and you prayed for him?

475
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,497
Of course.

476
00:35:41,077 --> 00:35:45,527
Can't you see? By committing an evil act
the poor man injured his soul?

477
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:49,118
I'm glad there's a well.

478
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,548
Cause it sure gets thirsty
around here.

479
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:55,048
...if we had to wait for Carson.
Gotta walk this pony.

480
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:09,838
Penny.

481
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:13,028
Nothing.

482
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:25,918
Be sure you don't leave any
slack on that cinch.

483
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,588
Boss will sure howl...

484
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:30,079
This ain't the first pony
I ever saddled.

485
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,379
...he'd squawk no matter
how I done it.

486
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,289
He's sure getting mean these days,
ain't he?

487
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,119
You can take it as his natural born.

488
00:36:37,419 --> 00:36:40,319
That boil on his neck don't
help him none either.

489
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:44,529
Get out of my way.

490
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,279
You belong behind a plough.

491
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,660
Who's Carson?

492
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,410
Don't get down. We ain't taking
on no saddle tramps on this spread.

493
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,810
Are you deaf?
I said get moving, tramp.

494
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,670
Nice dam.
- Yeah, what's that to you?

495
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,710
Take out the top two planks.

496
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,370
What did you say?

497
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,150
The top two. There are 16 inches
of water over there.

498
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,460
Who says so?
- I do.

499
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,900
And who might you be when
you're at home?

500
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,790
Quirt Evans.

501
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,040
Well anybody might ride up here
and say they're Quirt Evans.

502
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,570
He ain't known round
here by sight.

503
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,561
Anybody can say
they're him.

504
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:52,691
Sure could.

505
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:54,931
<i>There's a "Q.E."
stamped on his saddle.</i>

506
00:37:57,511 --> 00:38:00,801
Well, take the top planks out of
the head gate, you stupid idiot.

507
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:16,661
I don't need all that extra water.

508
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,241
Step up on that pony.

509
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:23,621
Now, look here Mr. Evans, I've done
what you've told me to.

510
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,251
You sure did.
Step up on that pony.

511
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:29,421
Well, I'm the kind of fella who tries to
get along with everybody.

512
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:37,252
Side me.
- Wait a minute.

513
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:40,872
Maybe we better take off a
couple more of them planks...

514
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:43,272
cause I have 10 times
the water I need.

515
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:45,482
That will do for now.

516
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:48,952
Well, if you ever need more, Mr. Evans,
all you got to do is say so...

517
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:50,402
I figured that...

518
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:03,602
Hey, Mom! Water!

519
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,732
Water, water!

520
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:12,512
Mother, look at the flow.
Mother all the ditches are full of water.

521
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:17,163
Water! Water!
- Wonderful!

522
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:24,363
Thomas!

523
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:38,663
Let's start off from the scratch...

524
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:40,773
...you got more water than you need.

525
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,093
Absolutely right, Quirt,
I mean Mr. Evans.

526
00:39:44,743 --> 00:39:47,083
<i>Do you mind if I call you "Quirt"?</i>

527
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:48,593
Not a bit...

528
00:39:48,693 --> 00:39:51,803
So it's no skin off your moccasins if
you let a little water over that ditch.

529
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:54,794
<i>Absolutely no, Mr. Evans...
I mean, "Quirt".</i>

530
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:59,324
You're going to be neighborly or not?
- Well, I sure am, Quirt.

531
00:39:59,474 --> 00:40:01,344
That's the way to talk.

532
00:40:14,214 --> 00:40:15,534
Thomas!

533
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:20,594
Frederick Carson.
- Howdy, Mrs. Worth.

534
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:22,964
We always knew you would
change your mind.

535
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,284
Yes ma'am,
I did.

536
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:28,784
Thank you, Frederick, all of us here
in the valley are grateful to you.

537
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:31,324
Worth, it's like what
I was saying,

538
00:40:31,524 --> 00:40:33,324
I ain't got any use
for all that extra water...

539
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:35,465
Why shouldn't I let my
neighbors use it?

540
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:40,105
I believe that neighbors
should be friendly.

541
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:45,745
What have you got there on your neck?
A boil?

542
00:40:46,895 --> 00:40:50,015
Mrs. Worth, I have wrestled with
that dang burnt boil...

543
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,115
Have you tried putting soap into it?

544
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:53,805
No, ma'am. I ain't.

545
00:40:53,905 --> 00:40:56,775
You get down for a minute and into
the house and I'll fix it for you.

546
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:02,115
You are going to hurt me?
- No...That's a shame... it looks awful.

547
00:41:12,645 --> 00:41:16,256
Well, looks like your prayers
straightened everything out.

548
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,836
So, you think your gun changed
Frederick Carson?

549
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,816
Who says I pointed a gun?

550
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,746
I do.
- Well, I didn't.

551
00:41:22,886 --> 00:41:25,136
He gave in more easily
than I expected.

552
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:27,056
Thee remember this, Quirt:

553
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:29,756
<i>"The lord moves in
mysterious manner...</i>

554
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,966
<i>...at times using strange methods
and odd instruments."</i>

555
00:41:33,026 --> 00:41:35,596
Me?
It would be odd.

556
00:41:39,996 --> 00:41:43,656
I just get a gnawin' hankerin' after
good pies and truck like that...

557
00:41:43,756 --> 00:41:45,386
Frederick Carson!
- Yes, ma'am?

558
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:46,706
I want you to have these,

559
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:48,506
they're awfully good with
coffee in the morning.

560
00:41:48,746 --> 00:41:51,336
Makes me to go home
and shoot my Chinese cook.

561
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:54,496
You just come back for more anytime
you like, there are always plenty.

562
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,176
Thanks.
- Goodbye.

563
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:57,727
Goodbye, Frederick.
- Goodbye.

564
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:04,187
A man outta see more
of his neighbors.

565
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:09,937
Wonderful woman that Mrs. Worth...
She fixed my boil.

566
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:11,317
[Mother]:
Penny!

567
00:42:11,537 --> 00:42:13,657
Excuse me. But I think father
wants to give thanks...

568
00:42:13,757 --> 00:42:15,387
You know, he already
thanked me.

569
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:18,117
I know, but now I think he wants to
thank someone else.

570
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:23,077
Hold my pondering when I get aboard.
Will you?

571
00:42:34,357 --> 00:42:37,297
Mrs. Worth is going to keep me
supplied in pies

572
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:40,668
... I ought to bring her a quarter of beef
now and then.

573
00:42:41,618 --> 00:42:43,938
Finally, come to an understanding
with my neighbors.

574
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,518
You sure did.

575
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:51,168
Oh! You knew I was scared to death,
when I made that speech to them people.

576
00:42:51,538 --> 00:42:55,488
...I'm glad you made me do it.
Makes me feel good.

577
00:42:56,558 --> 00:42:58,198
Adios, amigo.

578
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:11,958
Dinner.

579
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:24,159
What's the dinner
going to be?

580
00:43:24,259 --> 00:43:28,359
Roast venison, vegetables, and
of course a skimpy chicken.

581
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:31,559
With the pie and cake
I'll try to make out.

582
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,359
Chicken or venison?.
- Both. I feel real good.

583
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:37,059
Oh, thee do?

584
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:52,889
New dress.

585
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:55,899
<i>Oh! It's first day.
You call it "Sunday".</i>

586
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:59,259
Quirt, do me a favor,
hitch up the ponies for father.

587
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,710
Sure.

588
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,170
And will you do me
another favor?

589
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,420
Go for a ride with us.
- Where?

590
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,570
You're not to ask,
it's a surprise, a pleasant one.

591
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,940
Hey, Quirt!
We got a surprise for you.

592
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,400
He knows,
I told him.

593
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,680
Thought you weren't allowed
to work on Sunday?

594
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,820
Quirt, there is nothing we're
not allowed to do...

595
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,630
...it's just we don't believe
in doing what we know is wrong.

596
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,370
<i>That makes it pretty much
"Each fella's own guess".</i>

597
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,420
Each fella knows, inside.

598
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,590
There's a lot of gents I wouldn't
wanna give that much leeway to.

599
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:05,471
I didn't mean to
frighten you, miss.

600
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:09,821
Is there a fella named Quirt Evans
around here?

601
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:12,621
Yes, I'll get him.

602
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:15,371
Never mind.
I can do my talking to you.

603
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:18,431
Has he been here long?

604
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,661
About 3 weeks I guess.

605
00:45:21,462 --> 00:45:27,612
He didn't disappear for say,
2 days, during that time, did he?

606
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:32,042
No.
- Hello, you weather beaten old hang man...

607
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:35,022
Penny, this is Wistful McLintock...
the marshal of the territory.

608
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:36,372
Hiya, Miss!

609
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:39,172
Don't let that grey hair fool you.
He's a curly wolf.

610
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:43,152
Hello, Quirt. I thought I had
you about half hung.

611
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:47,432
Tall fella. Fast with a gun, held up
the Baker's stage. Killed a couple.

612
00:45:48,462 --> 00:45:52,762
Well, you're tall and some say
you're a fast man.

613
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:57,392
..but I guess, I'll have to take
the little lady's word for it.

614
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:02,273
When you and Laredo Stevens going to
get around to killing one another?

615
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:03,943
Laredo?

616
00:46:03,983 --> 00:46:06,413
We water our horses out of the
same trough...

617
00:46:07,033 --> 00:46:09,673
Well, I'm sure looking forward
to hanging the survivor.

618
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:12,753
You know, I'm a figuring man...

619
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:17,153
...sometimes I don't know
all the answers....

620
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:20,853
<i>...like that fella
"Quirt Evans"</i>

621
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,263
Handy man with a colt...

622
00:46:23,273 --> 00:46:26,823
...while he was acting as Wyatt Earp's
deputy over in Tombstone.

623
00:46:27,873 --> 00:46:29,223
...one day he turns in his badge,

624
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:33,023
and starts to build himself
a nice cattle spread.

625
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:38,573
Suddenly sells out
and he goes on a pry.

626
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:45,644
Why? That's what I
ain't figured yet.

627
00:46:45,714 --> 00:46:47,314
Sometimes things connect.

628
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:52,114
<i>About that time a fella,
called "Walt Emerson"...</i>

629
00:46:52,404 --> 00:46:54,724
...went down in front of
Laredo Stevens...

630
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:57,534
...Walt was reaching at the time,

631
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:01,034
some say a gambler standing there
grabbed his hand....

632
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:03,304
...maybe that's connected...

633
00:47:04,764 --> 00:47:07,244
How did you stand
with Walt Emerson?

634
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:09,314
I knew him.

635
00:47:10,634 --> 00:47:12,134
Two things connected?

636
00:47:13,054 --> 00:47:14,634
I know a lot of people.

637
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:17,714
Well, I'll figure it out...

638
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:21,504
...I usually do.
I'm patient.

639
00:47:23,664 --> 00:47:26,265
Little lady, don't be looking at him...

640
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:28,915
with your eyes all bugged out
like a cow would a bull.

641
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:33,405
...there ain't no future in it.
So long, folks.

642
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:39,165
Quirt, please stay away
from Laredo Stevens.

643
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:42,765
He owes me money. And don't worry,
I might come out on top.

644
00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:44,805
That would be even worse.

645
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,295
Worse! Would it be worse if he
goes down than I go down?

646
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:49,925
Of course,
don't you see?

647
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:52,065
Oh, I'll be a guy
with a marked soul.

648
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:56,505
Don't make it sound so crude, Quirt,
you see why- I couldn't love you.

649
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:02,195
Alright, I won't
look up Laredo.

650
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:04,415
It's better this way

651
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:05,836
...every time he opens his door,

652
00:48:05,936 --> 00:48:09,136
every time he hears footsteps
coming round the corner...

653
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,036
...Laredo will start sweating,
thinking it's me.

654
00:48:12,136 --> 00:48:14,416
...His food won't set well
for the rest of his life.

655
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,936
Well alright, if I'm going to be holy
I gotta get some fun out of it.

656
00:48:41,476 --> 00:48:44,116
You know I feel like such a gadabout.

657
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:46,717
It seems hardly a whole week
since last First day.

658
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:06,677
Hey, Quirt!

659
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:13,777
I thought it was you.

660
00:49:14,807 --> 00:49:16,497
Well, well, well.
- Hello.

661
00:49:16,627 --> 00:49:19,257
Mister and Mrs. Worth, Miss Worth,
Randy McCall.

662
00:49:19,277 --> 00:49:21,787
How do you do?
- How do you do?

663
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:23,347
Just fine, thank you.

664
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:26,287
Well, well, well...
- You said that before.

665
00:49:26,657 --> 00:49:28,338
We don't want to keep you
if you're in a hurry.

666
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,818
I'm not in no hurry. I've got no place to go.
- Well, we have.

667
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:33,508
Would ye care to come along with us?
- Sure, where?

668
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,298
To a meeting.
Both men: To a meeting?

669
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:40,818
Yes, to meeting.
You don't wanna go do you?

670
00:49:40,918 --> 00:49:44,398
It would be nice if he could.
- We'd be happy to have any friend of Quirt's.

671
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:46,888
You would?
Well that's just fine.

672
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:49,508
You know, ma'am...
I sure am an old friend of Quirt's.

673
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:53,418
I remember one time we were chasing some
cattle down the Lawanda river...

674
00:49:53,518 --> 00:49:57,358
...herd stampeded, Quirt pulled me out
from underneath it.

675
00:49:57,668 --> 00:50:00,738
And there was another time, remember?
In Opus Palace, down at San Antonio.

676
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:02,568
We're late.
- I know, but...

677
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:03,568
Good bye.

678
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,508
If you can join us it is in the grove,
just on the other side of the town.

679
00:50:06,518 --> 00:50:08,139
Thank you, ma'am.
- Good day.

680
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,019
Get along.
- Good day.

681
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:22,519

that makes it worth all this work?

692
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,250
Hello, Nelson.
- Hello, Penny.

693
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,330
Nelson, meet Quirt Evans.

694
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:06,550
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

695
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,360
Nelson's our horse shoer.

696
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:19,040
By the way, I brought that
maple sugar you like so much.

697
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,210
Oh, excuse me, I'll put it here.
- Thank you.

698
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,750
Isn't this the Morgan baby?
- Yes, I'm minding her.

699
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,450
He sure is a cute little fella.

700
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,111
Looks just like his father.

701
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:38,311
I'm coming out next week
to shoe the horses.

702
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:40,461
Oh, fine.

703
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:46,331
I'll get some water.
- Here, let me help you.

704
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,411
Here, twirl this thing.

705
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:51,021
Frozen pudding.

706
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:08,421
Hold him a minute, Quirt,
I want some of those flowers.

707
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,582
Sick or something?

708
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:19,192
I don't believe it.

709
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:28,022
It's a baby.
- Yeah, I know.

710
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:31,362
Is it old enough to talk?
- Of course not.

711
00:52:31,642 --> 00:52:33,842
If it can't talk,
it can't snitch.

712
00:52:34,242 --> 00:52:36,762
I've got something I think
you would like to hear.

713
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:39,492
Laredo Stevens
is planning a big play.

714
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:41,422
...he's going to jump
up some guys

715
00:52:41,522 --> 00:52:43,122
that are moving a trail herd
down from the north.

716
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:47,042
I figured, it maybe you, me and
couple of friends can play copycat.

717
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:50,322
You heard me,
didn't you?

718
00:52:50,422 --> 00:52:52,623
You can have
my part of it.

719
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:54,423
What am I listening to?

720
00:52:54,523 --> 00:52:57,323
You passing up a chance
to blister Laredo?

721
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:58,223
That's right.

722
00:52:58,323 --> 00:52:59,923
What's the matter with you, Quirt?
Is farm life...

723
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:02,423
Oh, the Jane....

724
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:05,903
Sticking in your head into this bucket
will shut you up.

725
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:09,383
You are getting awful touchy lately... you never
used to mind what I said.

726
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:11,473
Hello.
- Hi.

727
00:53:11,513 --> 00:53:13,033
Come along with the water, Quirt.

728
00:53:14,253 --> 00:53:15,533
Shut up.

729
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:37,384
Quirt, would you
come over here?

730
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,164
Sit down.

731
00:53:53,784 --> 00:53:55,174
May I have your attention?

732
00:53:56,924 --> 00:54:00,014
Friends, we all know the purpose
of this meeting is three fold.

733
00:54:00,434 --> 00:54:03,764
As always, to give thanks to the
goodness bestowed upon us.

734
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:09,254
...but also to give thanks for the particular
that the fields are getting water.

735
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,724
... and the crops and
the livestock thrive.

736
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,705
There are two marsh's
right at the top of the valley.

737
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:18,795
...if you take a look from out there, you
can see a herd coming from 10 miles.

738
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:21,085
[Mr. Worth]:
...Quirt Evans.

739
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:28,915
Friends...

740
00:54:35,985 --> 00:54:39,315
We are happy to present you with this
token of our friendship for you.

741
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,265
<i>This is "Quirt Evans".</i>

742
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:51,535
We are happy to have him here with us,
because he provided another incident

743
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,655
...which reaffirms our belief...

744
00:54:53,755 --> 00:54:56,426
...that all men are good
if they're shown the light.

745
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:59,596
<i>He persuaded Frederick Carson
to let down the water...</i>

746
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:03,866
...by showing him, that a man who
is a friend to other men...

747
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:05,486
is a happy man himself.

748
00:55:11,796 --> 00:55:13,916
May I shake your hand,
Quirt Evans?

749
00:55:33,326 --> 00:55:35,327
I want to talk to you.

750
00:55:42,427 --> 00:55:45,427
This will sound like I'm butting
into your business and I am.

751
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:48,327
And you outta give me a watch
with a gold case for doing it.

752
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:50,927
You dim witted nail bender!
Marry that girl.

753
00:55:51,027 --> 00:55:53,927
Marry her? Why sure, you know...,
she knows how I feel.

754
00:55:54,027 --> 00:55:55,627
How would she know?

755
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,027
Stop yammering about shoeing horses,
that's no way to talk to a girl.

756
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:03,427
Talk to her about her.
And marry her. And do it quick.

757
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,927
Hey!
- Come on!

758
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:18,128
Listen to this.....

759
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:21,128

761
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:25,128
<i>"who had done many acts of valor,</i>

762

midst of a pit in time of snow"</i>

764
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,428
Whoo! Three lions!

765
00:56:31,928 --> 00:56:35,428
<i>"And Benaiah slew an Egyptian
who had a sword.</i>

slew him with a staff."</i>

767
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:40,128
I guess that must mean
a club.

768
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:43,528
Oh, brother, this is good writing.
- Let's go.

769
00:56:43,628 --> 00:56:45,428
What about the Bible?

770
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,528
You can't throw it away.
That would be bad luck.

771
00:56:47,628 --> 00:56:48,728
Then keep it.

772
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:52,828
Alright. This is one book
I'm sure going to read.

773
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:08,029
I'd better take you back
to the Morgans.

774
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,729
Why did Quirt leave
so abruptly?

775
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:18,129
I don't know...

776
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:38,730
Hey, Boss!
- Yeah?

777
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,830
Right on time.
Look behind you.

778
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:53,030
Let's saddle up, men.

779
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,231
Let's get out of here.

780
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:38,131
Look! Coming down
off the hill!

781
00:58:39,831 --> 00:58:41,631
Come on...

782
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:20,232
<i>Hey Quirt,
what does "beget" mean?</i>

783
00:59:24,032 --> 00:59:25,932
I think I hear them.

784
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:30,132
Yeah!
- Let's get hitched up.

785
00:59:31,432 --> 00:59:33,532
I don't know how I
missed this book.

786
00:59:36,432 --> 00:59:38,782
You know you're very strange.
But I like you just the same.

787
00:59:38,882 --> 00:59:40,733
On account your head works.

788
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:45,233
Much nicer this way....

789
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:47,733
You know anybody can
just shoot these guys.

790
00:59:47,933 --> 00:59:50,133
...you think of an interesting
way of doing it.

791
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,533
...and you know, Quirt.
I hate to shoot people.

792
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:56,633
Remember I shot a waddie
once in Montana?

793
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:59,133
I dreamed about it,
all the next night.

794
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:02,183
Then of course, there's always witnesses,
then you gotta shoot the witnesses.

795
01:00:02,283 --> 01:00:05,833
Stop jabbering and let's go.
- Okay, take it easy pal.

796
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:07,833
Settle down,
don't wanna lose my war bags.

797
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:11,133
Then again, I figured you may
have changed your mind

798
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,633
about shooting it out with Laredo
along with these guys.

799
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:16,833
Step up on that horse.
- Okay, you got it.

800
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:21,433
Maybe you're just crowding Laredo
into drawing in front of a lot of people.

801
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,034
Gonna save him for a big night
in town, eh?

802
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:29,334
Hey... look!

803
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,334
Let's go.

804
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,035
Take the outsider, Dennis.

805
01:01:59,736 --> 01:02:02,336
Start turning them, Hondo.

806
01:02:03,036 --> 01:02:05,036
I ain't, Hondo.

807
01:02:40,537 --> 01:02:42,537
That's a horse like Quirt has...

808
01:02:42,637 --> 01:02:44,537
Yeah! That's just who it is.

809
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:48,637
Next time we face...
- Yeah! I know...

810
01:02:49,137 --> 01:02:52,637
Wipe those new boots off
and see if you can run him down.

811
01:03:18,738 --> 01:03:21,638
You know that champagne may be
a lot fancier than whiskey.

812
01:03:21,738 --> 01:03:23,038
..But sure it don't give
you quick action.

813
01:03:23,138 --> 01:03:26,338
To tell you the truth, I don't really like it.
- It's very fashionable.

814
01:03:26,438 --> 01:03:27,838
How do you like it, Lila?

815
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:31,438
Tickles going down and it's expensive.
So I like it.

816
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,238
You sleepy, Tommy?
- Nope.

817
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:37,038
Tired?
- No.

818
01:03:37,238 --> 01:03:40,338
Worried, or maybe
just plain bored?

819
01:03:40,438 --> 01:03:43,438
Not a chance, baby.
You never bored me.

820
01:03:43,538 --> 01:03:45,438
I wish I had that in writing.

821
01:03:45,438 --> 01:03:48,139
You know it's a long time
since you told me that...

822
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:50,539
...my hair reminded you of corn silk.

823
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:55,939
Alright! Your hair reminds
me of corn silk.

824
01:03:56,439 --> 01:04:00,339
All golden, darling?
- That's right...

825
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:02,719
All golden.

826
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:10,639
You have changed...
You're less romantic.

827
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,139
...a lot more absentminded.

828
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:19,339
Take a turn at the wheel.
Win yourself a farm in Kansas.

829
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:21,939
I don't want a farm in Kansas.

830
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:25,339
Well alright! I'll win you
a trip around the world.

831
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,340
Miss Lila, the customers are waiting,
and that's no way to treat customers.

832
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,341
25 hot one on the red.

833
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,541
Give me a stack of blues.

834
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:25,041
<i>"There's something in your eyes...</i>

835
01:05:25,141 --> 01:05:27,841
<i>"...a little bit different.</i>

836
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:32,341
<i>"Something that appeals to me.</i>

837
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:38,641
<i>"I love the way they change
from angels to devils...</i>

838
01:05:38,841 --> 01:05:42,941
<i>"always full of mystery.</i>

839
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:49,442
<i>"There is something in your smile
a little bit different...</i>

840
01:05:49,742 --> 01:05:53,342
<i>"Something I've been looking for.</i>

841
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:59,742
<i>"If I could just be sure
that you're on the level...</i>

842
01:05:59,942 --> 01:06:03,842
<i>"...I would never ask for more.</i>

843
01:06:04,442 --> 01:06:09,142
<i>"I got a funny little feeling...</i>

844
01:06:09,442 --> 01:06:13,842
<i>"...the first time we met.."</i>

845
01:06:13,942 --> 01:06:15,442
17 odd on black.

846
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:18,642
17, there goes the last button
on my shirt.

847
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:24,342
Alright buddy, you gonna let it ride?
Going to ride on 17?

848
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:26,742
Cash me in.

849
01:06:28,642 --> 01:06:30,743
Place your bets.

850
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:36,343
<i>Something that I never knew...</i>

851
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:39,043
<i>"In every way...</i>

852
01:06:39,143 --> 01:06:43,543

853
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:51,743
<i>"That's why I - love - youuuu!!!"</i>

854
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,743
Thanks for the money, daddy.

855
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:57,443
I hope you didn't think
I was hinting.

856
01:07:00,343 --> 01:07:02,843
Bourbon,
large glass.

857
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:04,343
There's plenty of rooms on either side,

858
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:06,843
you have to come bullying
in between us?

859
01:07:06,943 --> 01:07:08,143
I didn't see you...

860
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:10,293
You interrupted a very
important discussion

861
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,534
on serious matters
regarding big things.

862
01:07:12,814 --> 01:07:14,394
Me and my brothers
don't like it.

863
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,504
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
no trouble please.

864
01:07:16,784 --> 01:07:19,864
We just put the place back together
after the last difference of opinion..

865
01:07:19,984 --> 01:07:23,054
...gentlemen, more over the breakage
and the overhead. Mainly the breakage.

866
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:25,504
I've had a dreadful time
keeping body and soul together.

867
01:07:27,304 --> 01:07:29,604
What I think is going to happen,
happens...

868
01:07:29,804 --> 01:07:31,604
...it will round off a full day.

869
01:07:34,494 --> 01:07:35,774
There's your trip.

870
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:38,124
What's eating you, tall man?

871
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:40,454
You had words with
those Baker brothers?

872
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:42,724
Who?
- Those 4 rhinos.

873
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:47,484
No.

874
01:07:47,584 --> 01:07:49,564
Told around they're some
quarrelsome citizens.

875
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:54,535
Gentlemen, lets consider the incident
closed. Watch our tempers.

876
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,165
Maybe I oughta go
and apologize.

877
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:11,595
More whiskey.
-That did it!

878
01:08:14,545 --> 01:08:16,965
I'll be right back.
I hope.

879
01:08:27,805 --> 01:08:30,085
Where have you been?
- Oh, Randy always on tap.

880
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:34,176
You don't know what you
are doing to me...

881
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,016
Please...
I've got a large family.

882
01:08:50,546 --> 01:08:52,546
Hey, wait a minute,
it's me.

883
01:08:55,646 --> 01:08:58,346
Billy, get him.

884
01:08:58,446 --> 01:09:00,146
That's my old friend, Billy.

885
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:09,346
Come on get him... come on
get hold of him.

886
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:16,147
Go on, you got him.
You've got him!

887
01:09:18,447 --> 01:09:19,947
Thanks.

888
01:09:20,747 --> 01:09:24,647
I must have hit the wrong man.
- I'll say you did, you...

889
01:09:33,947 --> 01:09:37,047
Hey, for...!
- Sorry, Quirt. How you doing?

890
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:51,447
Don't worry about me.
Come on.

891
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:55,048
You wait outside. Check them
and count them as we throw them out.

892
01:10:01,048 --> 01:10:03,048
One!
- Don't count!

893
01:10:14,648 --> 01:10:16,648
It's gettin' late.

894
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,448
Oh honey, I was so afraid
you'd get hurt.

895
01:10:27,448 --> 01:10:31,448
<i>All singing: "And I'll never see my
darling any more</i>

896
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:37,449
<i>"I'm sitting by the river
and I'm weeping all the day!!!</i>

897
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:41,449
<i>"For you've gone from the
old Kentucky shore!!!"</i>

898
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:45,749
It's wonderful. We have money,
whiskey and lovely ladies,

899
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:47,149
and just had a beautiful fight.

900
01:10:47,249 --> 01:10:49,449
...I tell you, we would really oughta
be thankful for our blessings.

901
01:10:49,549 --> 01:10:52,049
Ah, you have been reading
that Bible again.

902
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:53,849
That's something I never
thought I would see.

903
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:54,949
What?

904
01:10:55,049 --> 01:10:56,649
A Bible with your name on it.

905
01:10:56,749 --> 01:10:59,849
Now where would you
get a Bible?

906
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:07,249
Quirt!

907
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:13,949
Oh Randy,
stop him.

908
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:15,549
With what?

909
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:18,150
Where is he going?
Has he forgotten something?

910
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:19,950
No.

911
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,950
Penny, what is wrong with thee?

912
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,550
Table cloths don't belong in there.

913
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,350
Oh, I'm sorry.

914
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:17,751
Quirt!

915
01:12:17,951 --> 01:12:20,251
Unsaddle my horse,
will you kid?

916
01:12:20,351 --> 01:12:21,651
Sure!

917
01:12:21,851 --> 01:12:23,751
Want a boarder for a while?

918
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:26,551
Of course. You're always welcome.
- Quirt!

919
01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:28,051
Hello!

920
01:12:28,151 --> 01:12:31,351
I haven't had a decent meal
since I left here. Chocolate?

921
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:34,151
Not very good, the flour you know.

922
01:12:34,251 --> 01:12:36,451
I'll just stick around
till you get one right.

923
01:12:36,551 --> 01:12:39,352
I'll feed the chickens.
- So early, Penny?

924
01:12:39,452 --> 01:12:41,852
Yes. Can you help me, Quirt?

925
01:12:48,752 --> 01:12:51,952
Does it take two to feed
a few chickens, mother?

926
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:56,652
At times, Thomas, at times.
Remember?

927
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:06,752
You came back?

928
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:08,952
Yes.

929
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,452
Why?

930
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:15,752
I don't know exactly.

931
01:13:15,852 --> 01:13:18,152
Why did you go away
without saying anything?

932
01:13:18,252 --> 01:13:20,253
I don't know that exactly, either.

933
01:13:20,453 --> 01:13:23,053
I think it's because
I frightened you.

934
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:26,253
I know that sounds strange
that I should frighten you, but .....

935
01:13:26,353 --> 01:13:27,753
...but I mean it.

936
01:13:27,853 --> 01:13:31,053
You were frightened
because I was stupid.

937
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:33,153
You thought that living with me
would be tiresome ...

938
01:13:33,253 --> 01:13:35,653
..and dull after a while.

939
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,853
Tiresome and dull because....

940
01:13:37,953 --> 01:13:42,053
...all I knew, raised since a baby,
here among the farmers was our belief...

941
01:13:42,253 --> 01:13:47,053
...that people love, marry, and
stay together forever after that.

942
01:13:47,453 --> 01:13:51,753
I'm not such a fool not to know that
outside worldly places that people love...

943
01:13:51,853 --> 01:13:56,153
...it doesn't have to follow that they
marry and stay together forever.

944
01:13:56,253 --> 01:13:58,253
I know that sometimes
they separate.

945
01:13:58,353 --> 01:14:00,054
Are you ever going to run down
and let me talk?

946
01:14:00,154 --> 01:14:03,454
No, Quirt, that's what you were afraid of,
that I tie myself around your neck..

947
01:14:03,554 --> 01:14:06,454
...and when you get tired you
couldn't be rid of me...

948
01:14:06,554 --> 01:14:09,954
and I made up my mind that if you
come back I'd tell you this.

949
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:12,454
...but whatever you want,
Quirt, you can leave...

950
01:14:12,454 --> 01:14:14,854
If I go away
ye go with me.

951
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:16,814
If I go away,
thee go away.

952
01:14:31,954 --> 01:14:34,054
I used to be an Injun fighter.

953
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:38,654
Just can't help walking up
soft on people..

954
01:14:39,554 --> 01:14:41,355
Morning, missy...

955
01:14:41,555 --> 01:14:45,055
This young man been doing
any traveling since I was here last?

956
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:48,855
A fellow over Castle Verde Way lost
a big herd a few days ago.

957
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:53,055
Well, missy...
Cat got your tongue?

958
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,755
Why ask her?
You know I have been traveling.

959
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:58,155
You look at my corral
to see how my horse shaped up..

960
01:14:58,355 --> 01:15:01,655
I did just that...
You sure covered a lot of country.

961
01:15:01,855 --> 01:15:04,555
It's a right weary animal..

962
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:08,755
I just want to see if the young lady
would lie for you.

963
01:15:12,455 --> 01:15:14,855
I was going to...

964
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:16,555
You have been over to Castle Verde Way?

965
01:15:16,655 --> 01:15:19,855
I've been to Rimrock
and I got witnesses to prove it.

966
01:15:19,955 --> 01:15:22,756
Witnesses!
For instance?

967
01:15:22,856 --> 01:15:26,456
Randy McCall, Christine Taylor.

968
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:31,256
That's what I call witnesses.
Who else?

969
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:34,056
Lila Neal, I suppose.

970
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:36,856
She'd make a good
alibi witness for you.

971
01:15:37,256 --> 01:15:40,456
Randy, Christine and Lila...

972
01:15:40,656 --> 01:15:42,956
...there's three to draw to.

973
01:15:44,056 --> 01:15:46,556
So Lila saw you there too, huh?

974
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:48,356
Yes.

975
01:15:53,856 --> 01:15:58,156
Come here, jug head...
You dollar and a half bush jumper...

976
01:16:04,707 --> 01:16:06,807
Well, guess I missed you again, Quirt.

977
01:16:08,257 --> 01:16:10,157
...but I'm patient..

978
01:16:10,257 --> 01:16:13,357
...that's what hangs all you fellows
in the end.

979
01:16:13,757 --> 01:16:15,657
...I'm patient.

980
01:16:24,757 --> 01:16:26,357
Lila?

981
01:16:28,857 --> 01:16:31,357
You talked about her
when you were delirious.

982
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,970
Quirt, I...

983
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:11,470
...I wish my hair were...

984
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:15,470
...golden like corn silk, like you said.

985
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:42,970
There is a sight
I never thought I'd see.

986
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:45,420
Quirt Evans behind a plough.

987
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:48,851
The pony walks as soft as you do.

988
01:18:48,951 --> 01:18:53,201
I taught him.
Oh, I figured you'd have heard him.

989
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:56,121
...except you were thinking too hard.

990
01:18:57,861 --> 01:19:01,761
Haven't you got some real important
business to attend to?

991
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:04,261
Some place else.
- Sure.

992
01:19:04,361 --> 01:19:07,461
But I always liked to keep track
of your whereabouts.

993
01:19:16,261 --> 01:19:17,861
You know, Quirt...

994
01:19:18,161 --> 01:19:21,961
...I always figured on using a
new rope in hanging you...

995
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:25,861
'Cause I kind of respected you.

996
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:28,662
You never took the best of things....

997
01:19:29,062 --> 01:19:31,662
...and all your men went down
looking at you.

998
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:34,262
Go and mind your own business.

999
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:36,062
I usually do.

1000
01:19:36,662 --> 01:19:41,362
It's a shame things don't always
turn out the way they should.

1001
01:19:43,062 --> 01:19:47,262
Now that little gal... she might marry
some young fella..

1002
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:50,562
...who would know what to
do with that plough...

1003
01:19:51,062 --> 01:19:54,262
Why don't you kick up that horse
and move on?

1004
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:57,362
Some young fella that would
raise up a lot of grain.

1005
01:19:58,562 --> 01:20:02,662
...cows, sheep, kids..

1006
01:20:03,862 --> 01:20:08,763
..the kind of a fella that she'd
always know where he was..

1007
01:20:09,163 --> 01:20:11,363
Do I have to run you off?

1008
01:20:11,463 --> 01:20:16,463
Well now I tell you. I never have
been run off no place yet.

1009
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:18,863
...where I aim to stay.

1010
01:20:19,463 --> 01:20:22,163
But it just so happens
that I gotta be going.

1011
01:20:27,863 --> 01:20:29,663
No, Quirt...

1012
01:20:30,463 --> 01:20:32,863
...you don't rate a
new rope with me.

1013
01:20:54,564 --> 01:20:55,964
Look, ah...

1014
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:02,264
...does a lot of potpourri and
nonsense have to go with it?

1015
01:21:02,364 --> 01:21:03,864
..I'm not going to stand
for a lot of...

1016
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:05,964
dressing up and a batch
of jabbering people...

1017
01:21:06,064 --> 01:21:08,364
...looking at me,
just because I'm getting married.

1018
01:21:10,164 --> 01:21:13,664
Oh Quirt,
come along with me.

1019
01:21:13,964 --> 01:21:17,364
Well, yes or no?
- Come on.

1020
01:21:19,064 --> 01:21:21,364
Picking black berries?

1021
01:21:22,764 --> 01:21:24,464
Alright.

1022
01:21:28,864 --> 01:21:30,665
Alright.

1023
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,265
I think we have enough, Quirt.

1024
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:02,465
Never did like black berries...
Now I know I was right.

1025
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:07,465
It's too much work connected with it.
- I'll get some more ferns.

1026
01:22:27,506 --> 01:22:30,526
Look out there's a wasp on the petunia!
- Don't kill it.

1027
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:34,546
Well it's alright to for you to trust
wasps and people but...

1028
01:22:34,846 --> 01:22:38,066
...he might have known that I don't trust
him and decide to take first bite.

1029
01:22:38,096 --> 01:22:41,756
And incidentally that's not petunia,
that's a daisy.

1030
01:22:41,976 --> 01:22:43,376
That's a petunia.

1031
01:22:44,026 --> 01:22:45,986
Petunias, daisies,
daisies, petunias.

1032
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:48,866
Quirt Evans.

1033
01:22:49,566 --> 01:22:52,867
Oh nothing.
I just like the sound of it.

1034
01:22:52,967 --> 01:22:56,367
Quirt. Where did thee ever get
such an odd name?

1035
01:22:56,767 --> 01:22:59,667
Fellow who half raised me,
gave it to me.

1036
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:03,167
He found me somewhere along
a big cattle trail.

1037
01:23:03,267 --> 01:23:06,967
Folks had been bushwhacked
by Indians, I guess..

1038
01:23:07,467 --> 01:23:10,267
He was a big fella.
Cattleman.

1039
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:12,967
Swung a wide loop in his younger days,
I think.

1040
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:14,467
Wide loop?

1041
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:17,767
He wasn't too careful
whose calf he threw his rope at..

1042
01:23:18,467 --> 01:23:21,767
Most of the old cattlemen
were like that.

1043
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:27,067
He raised me. Quite a guy.
His name was Walt Emerson.

1044
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:31,867
He was down in a gambling place...

1045
01:23:33,498 --> 01:23:37,048
...a fellow grabbed his gun-arm just
as he drew. He was murdered.

1046
01:23:38,878 --> 01:23:40,128
Stop it.

1047
01:23:41,348 --> 01:23:42,698
Then what?

1048
01:23:43,048 --> 01:23:45,768
Well I just bounced around
from place to place.

1049
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:48,098
Quirt Evans.

1050
01:24:19,069 --> 01:24:21,999
I don't see any gun.
- I know him, he's got a gun alright..

1051
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:23,899
...I know him.

1052
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:28,899
Hyah!

1053
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,900
Hyah! Hyah!

1054
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,320
Hyah!

1055
01:26:14,321 --> 01:26:18,322
Hyah! Hyah!

1056
01:26:30,822 --> 01:26:32,322
Hyah!

1057
01:27:18,273 --> 01:27:20,223
Well, what are we waiting for?

1058
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:24,513
Nothing, I guess.
Let's find a saloon.

1059
01:27:30,353 --> 01:27:32,683
You don't have to be worry
about Penny, mother.

1060
01:27:33,113 --> 01:27:36,073
Oh, I cant help worrying about it,
Johnny.

1061
01:27:38,063 --> 01:27:40,244
Get that doctor.
Burn up the roads both ways.

1062
01:28:27,985 --> 01:28:29,165
A drink?

1063
01:28:32,435 --> 01:28:33,575
It's amazing...

1064
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:37,405
...the various uses to which
men put alcohol.

1065
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:40,295
To each different individual,

1066
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:44,055
it's either a stimulant, a depressant
or an anodyne.

1067
01:28:44,675 --> 01:28:46,905
Just now I'm using it
as an anodyne.

1068
01:28:48,495 --> 01:28:49,745
Get to the point.

1069
01:28:51,775 --> 01:28:53,305
Practice of medicine...

1070
01:28:53,465 --> 01:28:56,835
...is one of the most infuriating
professions known to man.

1071
01:28:58,605 --> 01:29:01,546
It takes 30 years of experience
to teach you...

1072
01:29:01,776 --> 01:29:06,056
...that in the final analysis there's
nothing to do but stand and watch.

1073
01:29:11,686 --> 01:29:13,646
If she has a lucid moment...

1074
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:16,476
...you better speak to her.

1075
01:29:29,516 --> 01:29:31,936
...I'm not trying to argue you out
of anything.

1076
01:29:32,546 --> 01:29:34,546
Maybe you ought to
stop and think.

1077
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:41,237
She wouldn't like this,
Quirt!

1078
01:29:42,467 --> 01:29:45,637
...I'm not arguing for or against
her point of view.

1079
01:29:46,087 --> 01:29:48,747
...I know to her, the world's worst
tragedy would be

1080
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:50,767
if you should kill a man.

1081
01:29:51,297 --> 01:29:53,507
Of course, you could
argue logically...

1082
01:29:53,707 --> 01:29:55,657
that she wouldn't know whether
you killed him or not.

1083
01:29:56,487 --> 01:29:58,287
I think she'd know.

1084
01:29:58,957 --> 01:30:01,877
Any discussion has to have
at least two participants.

1085
01:30:02,187 --> 01:30:04,127
Of course if you refuse
to answer me.

1086
01:30:06,227 --> 01:30:07,627
Quirt!

1087
01:30:11,977 --> 01:30:14,077
If I felt cynical....

1088
01:30:14,177 --> 01:30:17,577
...this would be a good opportunity to
observe that we are about to see,

1089
01:30:17,677 --> 01:30:21,477
<i>...a perfect example of
"An eye for an eye" etc.</i>

1090
01:30:22,278 --> 01:30:25,678
Unfortunately I can't quote
chapter and verse.

1091
01:30:26,278 --> 01:30:29,078
...I'm too tired
to be cynical.

1092
01:30:36,778 --> 01:30:39,978
Father, father,
come upstairs!

1093
01:30:41,678 --> 01:30:44,478
But thee are very ill,
thee must not be moving about.

1094
01:30:44,978 --> 01:30:46,078
Mother, I've got to go ...

1095
01:30:46,178 --> 01:30:48,578
Thee must get back into bed.
- But he needs me.

1096
01:30:48,678 --> 01:30:51,178
This is insanity. I told you
to keep her in bed.

1097
01:30:51,278 --> 01:30:52,978
Do you want to commit suicide?

1098
01:30:53,078 --> 01:30:54,978
If you don't stay under
those covers, young lady...

1099
01:30:59,778 --> 01:31:01,478
There's no fever.

1100
01:31:01,478 --> 01:31:04,379
Thee must do what the doctor says.
- Mother, please.

1101
01:31:04,879 --> 01:31:06,779
I can't understand it.

1102
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,979
I can't understand it at all.

1103
01:31:10,179 --> 01:31:12,979
There must be some logical
scientific explanation.

1104
01:31:13,179 --> 01:31:15,779
I'm too old to start
believing in miracles.

1105
01:31:16,279 --> 01:31:18,279
Wrap her in blankets.

1106
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:42,479
You know if the two hadn't
had me covered...

1107
01:31:43,179 --> 01:31:46,880
I would never let that Hondo Jeffries
pistol whip me...

1108
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,880
Wait till Quirt Evans hear about this...

1109
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,880
Quirt will take the starch out of
the whole caboodle of them.

1110
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,880
Why, Quirt and me once...

1111
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,380
...well, it was Dodge City
several years back.

1112
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:03,480
...when the Earps and Clantons were gunning.
Well me and Quirt...

1113
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,080
Come here.
- Yes, Mr. Evans.

1114
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,280
Know Laredo Stevens?

1115
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:24,881
He's in the Eagle,

1116
01:32:24,981 --> 01:32:27,381
and that pistol whipping Hondo
is with him.

1117
01:32:30,381 --> 01:32:32,381
Take him a message.

1118
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:40,881
Hey, buy the boys a drink.
- Celebrating?

1119
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:43,681
Sure,
why not?

1120
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:46,181
Don't you get excited when you
make a big win like this?

1121
01:32:46,681 --> 01:32:49,981
Why get excited... sometimes you win
and sometimes you lose.

1122
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:53,381
Don't get excited,
gentlemen.

1123
01:33:02,881 --> 01:33:05,181
I ain't looking for trouble...

1124
01:33:05,481 --> 01:33:09,382
I'm just a carrier of a message.
- Yeah? What is it?

1125
01:33:09,482 --> 01:33:11,482
<i>He said to "Come out in the street...</i>

1126
01:33:11,782 --> 01:33:14,782
<i>...he's waiting for you."
- Who says?</i>

1127
01:33:15,082 --> 01:33:16,382
Quirt Evans.

1128
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:20,382
[Hits sour note on piano]

1129
01:33:23,282 --> 01:33:26,782
What is this, a joke?
Quirt Evans is...

1130
01:33:27,382 --> 01:33:29,882
Take a look out at the streets.
See, if it really is.

1131
01:33:34,482 --> 01:33:36,582
Jack, take a look at the street.

1132
01:33:53,783 --> 01:33:55,883
There's a tall hombre in
a black hat standing...

1133
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:58,383
...at the blacksmith's shop.

1134
01:34:03,483 --> 01:34:06,783
Mind if I use the back door, Pete?
- So long, Pete.

1135
01:34:25,083 --> 01:34:27,884
<i>Well, they say "a cat got nine lives."</i>

1136
01:34:30,084 --> 01:34:31,884
Maybe ole Quirt's part cat.

1137
01:34:32,184 --> 01:34:35,284
<i>He also said "He was curious to know
how much whiskey it would take...</i>

1138
01:34:36,084 --> 01:34:38,484
<i>"...to build up your nerve
to come out."</i>

1139
01:34:38,684 --> 01:34:39,884
You're fixing to get
your ears pin back?

1140
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,484
There's a better pair of ears
out in the street...

1141
01:34:41,584 --> 01:34:43,584
if you wanna pin
somebody's ears back.

1142
01:34:43,884 --> 01:34:45,784
Hey, you drink this.

1143
01:34:46,584 --> 01:34:50,284
Sure, if I don't have to
stand near you.

1144
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:51,784
Come on.

1145
01:34:51,784 --> 01:34:54,284
I wonder whether if that sharp
shooting Marshal is around town?

1146
01:34:54,384 --> 01:34:56,784
Oh, I saw him ride out of town
an hour ago.

1147
01:34:58,584 --> 01:35:02,184
That's good, we don't want him
around here to spoil our play.

1148
01:35:02,384 --> 01:35:05,684
Yeah, I bet that's just exactly
how you meant it.

1149
01:35:39,485 --> 01:35:42,285
Look out, there's going
to be a shooting!

1150
01:35:42,485 --> 01:35:46,285
Hyah, hyah!

1151
01:36:36,587 --> 01:36:38,087
Quirt!

1152
01:37:33,388 --> 01:37:34,788
Quirt...

1153
01:37:35,588 --> 01:37:37,788
...step away from those women.

1154
01:37:44,588 --> 01:37:46,388
Why don't you
turn around, Quirt?

1155
01:37:49,388 --> 01:37:51,388
[Gun shots ring out!]

1156
01:38:12,189 --> 01:38:14,389
Nothing ever works out right.

1157
01:38:21,589 --> 01:38:26,089
Had them dead to rights.
They got the Baker stage...

1158
01:38:26,589 --> 01:38:29,389
...so I figured I'd watch the ruckus.

1159
01:38:29,389 --> 01:38:33,090
You down them
and I'd hang you....

1160
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:34,990
...sort of...

1161
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:38,290
..Sort of killing three hawks
with one stone.

1162
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:39,990
...so to speak.

1163
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:44,790
Nothing, nothing ever works out right.

1164
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:50,590
I may have missed you again, Quirt,
but I'm patient.

1165
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,890
It's only a matter of time,
and I hang you.

1166
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:56,790
Not me,
mister.

1167
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:59,690
From now on
I'm a farmer.

1168
01:39:15,091 --> 01:39:16,691
That Quirt!

1169
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:23,991
Hey, Quirt might need that.

1170
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:28,491
No, only a man that carries a gun
ever needs one.

1171
01:39:28,791 --> 01:39:30,991
What are you going
to do with it?

1172
01:39:31,091 --> 01:39:35,191
Hang it on the wall in my office,
with a new rope!
