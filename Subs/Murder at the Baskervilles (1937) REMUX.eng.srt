1
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,050
How do you get into
this place, mr. Milton?

2
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:17,410
Around the back through
the mews in sladen street.

3
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,037
Eh, looks as
though it might do.

4
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,038
Let's go around.

5
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,962
What might you be
needing it for, mr. Martin?

6
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,251
We store antiques and
furniture in general.

7
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,794
Well, then it
ought to suit you.

8
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:29,380
It's fireproof and
thoroughly dry.

9
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:32,967
Come this way.

10
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,353
Not much left of the
booking office now.

11
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,816
Well, moran, mr.
Martin seems to have

12
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,986
done his work very
satisfactorily.

13
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,988
I carried out
your instructions

14
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:55,573
to the letter, professor.

15
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:59,160
Now, moran, let's
get our bearings.

16
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:02,204
That wall, I take it,
faces pelham street.

17
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,791
Exactly, originally the
main entrance to the station.

18
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,585
And the lift shaft?

19
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:11,088
Here on this side.

20
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,512
The lift's at the bottom.

21
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,473
Eighty feet below.

22
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,183
Quit a drop.

23
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,309
Eh, moran?

24
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:26,187
The power was
cut off, of course,

25
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,774
when they closed the station.

26
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,656
How about lunch, mr. Holmes?

27
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,782
What do you fancy?

28
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,617
A nice little bit of boiled cod?

29
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,160
My
Dear, mrs. Hudson,

30
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,537
life is sufficiently
dull at the moment

31
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,623
without adding boiled cod.

32
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,583
But there's nothing
better for an invalid.

33
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,378
Yes, but I object
to being referred to

34
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,130
as an invalid, mrs. Hudson.

35
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,507
I'm a little rundown possibly.

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,134
So I should think!

37
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,844
With all the tobacco you smoke,

38
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,721
you'll be getting
seccotine poisoning next.

39
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,932
Well, in that
case, mrs. Hudson,

40
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,767
I shall always stick to you.

41
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,771
Oh, mr. Holmes.

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,234
That'll be the doctor.

43
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,031
Dr. Watson.

44
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,284
- Hello, watson.
- Hello.

45
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,887
What's the
matter with you fellow

46
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:24,829
have you caught cold?

47
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:26,539
No it's this
infernal atmosphere.

48
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,059
I suppose
it is pretty thick.

49
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,683
Thick, my dear holmes
it's intolerable!

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,910
You could cut it with a knife.

51
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,755
Why you can open the window.

52
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,841
You walked here I perceive.

53
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:37,675
Yes.

54
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,802
And on the left-hand
side of the street.

55
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:40,803
Yes, that's right.

56
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,055
But how in the
world did you know?

57
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,056
My dear fellow,

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,057
it's simplicity itself.

59
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,601
You've got a little reddish
soil adhering to your shoe.

60
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,145
They're pulling
up the flagstones

61
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,706
in front of the wigmore
street post office,

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,023
and as the pavement is covered
with that reddish soil,

63
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,650
it's difficult to
avoid treading in it.

64
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,695
The post office is on the
left-hand side of the street.

65
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,905
Oh, of course, when
you put it like that,

66
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,615
it does sound simple.

67
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,843
Elementary, my dear watson.

68
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,827
- Elementary.
- By the way, holmes,

69
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,054
I hope you've decided to take

70
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,455
that holiday I
prescribed for you?

71
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,665
Well, up to nine
o'clock this morning,

72
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,169
I was distinctly
averse to the idea.

73
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,230
But I've received a letter
from an old friend of ours

74
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:16,964
which inclines me
to change my mind.

75
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,008
I'm delighted to hear it.

76
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:19,842
Who's it from?

77
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:23,429
Well, my dear fellow,
I'll read it to you.

78
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,267
"My dear holmes, I am
sending you and the doctor

79
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,604
"yet another invitation
to visit me here.

80
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,439
"Believe it or not it's 20 years

81
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,232
"since you disposed of the hound

82
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,818
"of the baskervilles for me."

83
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,945
Goodness, can you
believe that, watson?

84
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,281
Seems impossible to me.

85
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:43,115
Very good.

86
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,702
"My daughter diana is anxious
to make your acquaintance.”

87
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,497
Yes, but she's engaged, watson.

88
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,041
To young trevor, a
neighbor of theirs.

89
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,418
"I know you hate the country,

90
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,545
"just as I hate london,

91
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,130
"but stretch a
point and come down

92
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,799
"for a week or two with watson.

93
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,385
"Yours ever, henry baskerville."

94
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,034
Father's
asked sherlock holmes

95
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,935
to come here for a few days.

96
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:11,769
Why?

97
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,354
The family hound
come to life again?

98
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:15,689
Oh, don't be absurd.

99
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,893
Hello, you two youngsters.

100
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,821
Oh, dad do you really
think there's any chance

101
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:19,944
of mr. Holmes coming here?

102
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:21,654
Well, as you know
I haven't been able

103
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,239
to persuade him in the past.

104
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,323
For the post, sir?

105
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,325
Oh, thank you jack.

106
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:29,203
Holmes is a creature of habit.

107
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,871
He likes to bury
himself in baker street

108
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,290
and work out his
problems with the aid of

109
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,543
I don't know how many
ounces of tobacco a day.

110
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,127
I must say I'd
like to meet him.

111
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,589
He sounds a terribly
brainy sort of chap.

112
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,092
I wonder if he's any
good at spotting winners.

113
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:43,926
No, no.

114
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,689
Holmes's hobby is
spotting criminals, jack.

115
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,098
I don't think racing's
quit in his province.

116
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,381
Well, watson, what about it?

117
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,892
Could you get away
for a fortnight?

118
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,893
Yes, I think so.

119
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,813
The hope for an epidemic of
measles hasn't materialized.

120
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:56,814
Things are rather slack.

121
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:58,482
I could get a locum
to carry on for me.

122
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,985
Good, good, and I
will stretch a point

123
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,821
and write to baskerville.

124
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:04,989
Inspector lestrade, sir.

125
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:06,574
Good
morning, lestrade.

126
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,741
Anything important on hand?

127
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,909
Good morning, mr. Holmes.

128
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,470
- How are you, doctor?
- How do you do?

129
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:12,621
You've the air of something
unusual having occurred.

130
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,081
Well, yes, mr. Holmes

131
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:15,249
well, tell me about it.

132
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,167
Here you'll find a
cigar on the table.

133
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,085
Thank you.

134
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:19,879
I'm leaving london.

135
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,046
Well, god bless my soul,

136
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,882
this is a very sad
development, watson.

137
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,008
With professor moriarty,

138
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,802
that napoleon of
crime, still at large?

139
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,722
You and your professor
moriarty, mr. Holmes.

140
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:30,949
You seem to see his hand behind

141
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,433
every other crime
on the calendar.

142
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,185
The yard doesn't share
your views I'm afraid.

143
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,413
They think it's all moonshine.

144
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,064
Well, moonshine's a brighter
thing than fog, lestrade.

145
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,775
However, tell me
where you're going.

146
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,193
- Exeter.
- Exeter?

147
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,361
Promoted chief inspector.

148
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,530
Reorganizing the
traffic I presume.

149
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,824
No, no, barchester races.

150
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,159
Half the west country turn up,

151
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,994
and they make exeter
their headquarters.

152
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,495
I see, well, good
luck, lestrade.

153
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,723
If your talent for organization

154
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,187
is equal to your
flair for detection,

155
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,752
barchester races should be
something of a sensation.

156
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,170
Thank you, sir,

157
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,397
and in case it's any use to you,

158
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,006
the chief constable colonel ross

159
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,342
gave me something good
for the barchester cup.

160
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,343
Oh, what is it?

161
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,929
His own horse silver blaze.

162
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,156
Well, I'm afraid

163
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,657
I'm not much of a
betting man, lestrade,

164
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,809
but watson here thinks he
knows something about racing.

165
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,644
Silver blaze.

166
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,580
He was round about 10 to
one at the last call over.

167
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,916
You won't get anything like
that on him tomorrow, doctor.

168
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,792
It's an open secret that
he did a trial yesterday,

169
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,486
which puts him among the
greatest steers of all time.

170
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,130
You're becoming quite
a tipster, lestrade.

171
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,281
Yes, our
handy guide to the turf.

172
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,283
Well, anyway he
carries my money.

173
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,007
Better to be on a
certainty at short odds,

174
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,079
than down the course
to 100 to one, say I.

175
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,372
Well, there you are, watson.

176
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,373
Make a note of that.

177
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:38,896
As a matter of fact,
the doctor and I

178
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,417
are going down to
the west country

179
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,961
to stay with sir
henry baskerville,

180
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,128
so we may possibly see you.

181
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,129
I hope so, mr. Holmes,

182
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,507
and if you do feel like
having a flutter, doctor,

183
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,467
don't forget silver blaze.

184
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,636
Watson put a bet on for me.

185
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:52,346
What?

186
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,762
Looks fit enough, colonel.

187
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,396
Best horse I ever
owned, eh, straker?

188
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,397
You're right, sir.

189
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,940
It'll take a good
one to beat him.

190
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,703
You fancy lord merton's
horse, don't you?

191
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,294
Desborough, yes, I
have got a bet on him.

192
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,171
We'll see how they stand
in the betting tomorrow.

193
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,006
There's a call over today
at the victoria club.

194
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,367
We'll probably hear
all about it tonight.

195
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,368
Oh, before I go,

196
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:17,204
could I have a word
with you alone, colonel?

197
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:20,040
Certainly.

198
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,627
What is it?

199
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,755
Well, I want to
ask you a favor

200
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,216
I hope you won't mind.

201
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:30,884
Would you lend me...

202
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,761
Well, I really want 500 pounds.

203
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,596
Monkey!

204
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,824
That's pretty cruel, isn't it?

205
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,742
I'm in a devil of a hole
or I wouldn't ask for it.

206
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:38,851
Yeah, but why come to me?

207
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,078
Why not sir henry baskerville?

208
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,603
Well, it's to do
with racing debts,

209
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,081
and sir henry's
terribly down on racing.

210
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,816
Well, have you have
you tried your bank?

211
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,817
You've got security.

212
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,985
Mortgaged up to the hilt.

213
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:51,572
Well, what about what about
one of those financial firms?

214
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,198
No that's no good.

215
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,783
I've been dealing
with old bingham.

216
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,011
He won't spring another fiver.

217
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,287
What albert bingham
the money lender?

218
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,874
No, I'm sorry there's
nothing doing.

219
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:06,003
Well, thanks all the same.

220
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:28,317
Stay here, prince, I may
want you again shortly.

221
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,590
Those are the
instructions, barton.

222
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:52,257
Sure.

223
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,021
I'm expecting a
visitor in a few minutes.

224
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,513
You'd better stand by
with prince till he goes.

225
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:58,972
Very good, professor.

226
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:06,897
Bring him in.

227
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:13,821
Sit down, mr. Stanford.

228
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,448
I understand you
wish to consult me.

229
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,866
Yes, that's right.

230
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,201
What is your business?

231
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,202
Look here, professor.

232
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,703
I'm a commission
agent in a big way.

233
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,348
I am fully aware of
who and what you are.

234
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,833
Well, in that case
I'll come to the point.

235
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,627
I've laid bets amounting
to over 150,000 pounds

236
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,421
against silver blaze
at the barchester cup

237
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,258
when his price was
100 to six against.

238
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,384
You follow that?

239
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,218
Perfectly.

240
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,345
His trial yesterday
proves he's a smasher,

241
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:39,179
a world-beater.

242
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,782
At the call-over at the
victoria club tonight

243
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,059
he finished up a firm favorite
at seven to two against.

244
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,395
I can't lay off
anything to speak of,

245
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:47,771
so to cut a long story short,

246
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,565
if silver blaze wins the cup,

247
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:50,566
I go out of business.

248
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,860
I see, and you wish me to
arrange that silver blaze

249
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,446
does not come under
starter's orders, is that it?

250
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:57,406
Exactly.

251
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,991
Hmm, I must
confess that this is

252
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,494
a somewhat unusual
experience even for me.

253
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,873
I've had some little
association with the turf,

254
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,500
merely as a form of recreation,

255
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,668
and I have found in general

256
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:12,671
that bookmakers are an
honorable body of men.

257
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,506
See here, professor,
I haven't come here...

258
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,967
Sit down!

259
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,012
I presume you are aware
that what you're asking

260
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:23,098
is out of my usual
line of business.

261
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,325
I thought you were prepared

262
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,268
to take on anything
for a consideration.

263
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:26,935
Quite.

264
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,354
Depends on the size
of the consideration.

265
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,065
Well, I've told you
what I stand to lose.

266
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,358
What's your price?

267
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,736
Ten-thousand pounds.

268
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,488
Pretty
steep, isn't it?

269
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,240
It's not my custom to argue

270
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,743
about these matters,
mr. Stanford.

271
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:46,330
Take it or leave it.

272
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,292
- Very well.
- Then that settles it.

273
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,879
Now, mr. Stanford,
a few details.

274
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,297
Where is the horse trained?

275
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,716
King's pyland, dartmoor.

276
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,968
Colonel ross's training stables.

277
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,136
Ross.

278
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,970
Very good.

279
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,239
Now give me all the information

280
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:06,767
you can about the
colonel's employees

281
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,061
and their neighbors on the moor.

282
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:11,188
Do you know anything about them?

283
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,107
Yes, it so happens that I do.

284
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,694
As far as neighbors, there's
henry baskerville, jack trevor,

285
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,824
and silas brown who trains
for lord manston at capleton.

286
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,035
As to his employees,

287
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:28,622
there's straker his
trainer, mrs. Straker,

288
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:33,669
hunter, the head lad,
the usual stable boys.

289
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,356
Who's the bloke you
drove here to see the boss?

290
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,965
A fellow named
stanford, bookie.

291
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,132
Did he tell you anything?

292
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,816
No, don't suppose
he'd come around here

293
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,511
to hand out tips do you?

294
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,056
So he's pretty
deeply involved.

295
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,140
Up to his neck.

296
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,344
I know everything about him.

297
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,476
He's bet with me for years.

298
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,646
He owes a packet to albert
bingham the money lender.

299
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:53,480
Bingham?

300
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,691
Lots of racing
people deal with him.

301
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,943
That's the name, moran.

302
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,528
Buy up all his
debts from bingham

303
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:02,364
and from any other
quarters you can find.

304
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,283
Don't haggle about the price.

305
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,117
Buy it quickly.

306
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,202
I want to get the whip
hand over that gentleman

307
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,788
at the earliest possible moment.

308
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:10,664
Very good.

309
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:11,665
When that's done,

310
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:15,252
you be ready to leave
with me for dartmoor.

311
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,964
I'm going home now, straker.

312
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:20,799
I shall be there if you want me.

313
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:21,883
Take every precaution.

314
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,884
That's all right, sir.

315
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,678
Hunter here sleeps in
his box every night.

316
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,989
His bed's pushed
across the door,

317
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,573
and he bolts himself
in from the inside.

318
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,684
No one could even attempt
to enter without waking him.

319
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:31,351
Good.

320
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,938
I can trust you, straker.

321
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,065
Tell me, jack.

322
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,400
What is the matter?

323
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,111
Nothing the
matter, dear, really.

324
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:42,237
Oh, yes, there is.

325
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,365
I noticed it the
moment you arrived.

326
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,051
You're worried about
something, aren't you?

327
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:50,078
Really, darling, it's nothing.

328
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,162
Here's the car.

329
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:00,714
They're here, dad.

330
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:01,923
Arrived have they?

331
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,593
Good.

332
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,553
Well, here we are, watson.

333
00:14:06,636 --> 00:14:09,389
Come along.

334
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,900
My dear holmes.

335
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,193
Delighted to see you.

336
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:22,486
And we're delighted to come.

337
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:23,487
And you too, doctor.

338
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,714
Oh, that's very kind of you.

339
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,858
Again looking at you both,

340
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,133
I can't believe it's been years.

341
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,200
Oh, you flatter us.

342
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:31,370
Come along I want you
to meet my daughter.

343
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,537
Oh, thank you.

344
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,955
Delighted.

345
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,623
Diana.

346
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,584
This is mr. Holmes
and dr. Watson.

347
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,127
- How do you do?
- And mr. Trevor.

348
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,438
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

349
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,315
Now how about a whisky
and soda after your journey?

350
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,090
Oh, thank you.

351
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,734
I'm sure that's what dr.
Watson would prescribe.

352
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,358
Well, if I did, you
would automatically

353
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:47,636
refuse to take it.

354
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:48,804
He grows more obstinate

355
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,007
with the years, baskerville.

356
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,282
That's the way
with most of us.

357
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:52,626
Well, make yourselves
comfortable.

358
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,077
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, now baskerville,

359
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,560
tell me something
about yourself.

360
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,121
Oh, no, no, no,
holmes, that won't do.

361
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,063
You've got to do that.

362
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,607
Father's has been promising
us all a treat, mr. Holmes.

363
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,775
We shall see you in action.

364
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,276
Yes, with sir
henry as the victim.

365
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,571
I mean that we should see
mr. Holmes do his stuff.

366
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,406
His stuff?

367
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,949
That's a modern
expression, watson,

368
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:11,159
signifying to display
one's talents.

369
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:11,993
That's right!

370
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,930
I want mr. Holmes to tell
us what father's been doing

371
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,373
for the last 20 years
just by looking at him.

372
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,395
You evidently have great faith

373
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,837
in my abilities,
ms. Baskerville,

374
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,297
but I'm afraid there's
very little data.

375
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,258
I merely observe that
since we last met,

376
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:27,884
your father has
taken to billiards.

377
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,096
That he's recently played a
hundred up with mr. Trevor.

378
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:33,014
So, astutely correct,
holmes but how...

379
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,059
Oh, my dear fellow,
it's simplicity itself.

380
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,478
I observed that both you
and mr. Trevor have traces

381
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,022
of blue chalk between
the forefinger and thumb

382
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,023
of your left hands

383
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,317
put there, obviously,
to steady the cue.

384
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,904
There I hope that
satisfies you, diana.

385
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,115
Well, I expect you'd
like to see your rooms.

386
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,318
I'll show you, mr. Holmes.

387
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,909
You'll stay and dine, jack?

388
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,202
Well, thanks.

389
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,370
If you'll take me as I am

390
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,306
and don't mind my rushing
off immediately afterwards.

391
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,000
I've got to ride over the
moor to king's pyland.

392
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,794
I'm trying to get straker
to persuade colonel ross

393
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,962
to buy one of my ponies.

394
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:07,549
That's all right,
my boy, come along.

395
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,931
How's that curry
coming along, lizzie?

396
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:19,436
Just about ready,
mrs. Straker.

397
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,272
Leave some aside for
hunter when you've dished up.

398
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:25,233
Take it across to him
in silver blaze's box.

399
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,568
Very good, ma'am.

400
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,574
Everything all right, hunter?

401
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,160
Yes, thank you sir.

402
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,623
- I do hope mr.
- Straker isn't late.

403
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,850
He especially asked for curry.

404
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,377
He shouldn't be
long now, ma'am.

405
00:16:44,544 --> 00:16:46,588
Dinner's ready, jim.

406
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:50,175
All right, I'll just
go and have a wash.

407
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,720
Lizzie, don't forget
hunter's supper.

408
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,448
Oh, no, ma'am, I'm
keeping it hot for him.

409
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,682
All right, then you
can bring ours in now.

410
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,269
Very good, ma'am.

411
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,462
- Dear.
- Hello.

412
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,766
Mm, smells good.

413
00:17:39,849 --> 00:17:40,725
What?

414
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,269
Yes, you only just came in time.

415
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,955
Well, I've had
a lot to attend to.

416
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,481
Is the colonel coming
over again before the race?

417
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,649
He didn't say so.

418
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,585
He seemed quite satisfied
with the arrangements I made.

419
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,295
Who are you
sending in the horse box

420
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,237
with silver blaze?

421
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,756
Well, I'll
send hunter, of course,

422
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,591
and simpson will probably
follow along with him.

423
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,343
What's the betting
on silver blaze now?

424
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,870
Seventy-two, I think,
was the last call over.

425
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,876
Here's your supper, ted.

426
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,711
Thanks.

427
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:11,298
- Night, ted.
- Bye-bye, liz.

428
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,642
Is anybody about?

429
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,396
It's you, mr. Trevor.

430
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,397
Is straker at home?

431
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,984
Yes, sir.

432
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,823
Look after the mare
for me will you, simpson?

433
00:18:36,906 --> 00:18:40,410
Very good sir.

434
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:48,627
Mr. Trevor.

435
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,830
I hope I'm not butting in.

436
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,795
Not a bit come in.

437
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,382
I just called around to
have a chat about that pony.

438
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,136
Well, sit down.

439
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,929
Will you have a drink?

440
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:00,764
Oh, please.

441
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:04,351
- A biscuit?
- No, thank you.

442
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,024
Whose horse is that, simpson?

443
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,525
Mr. Trevor's, ma'am.

444
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,735
Haven't you seen him?

445
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,820
He wanted the guv'nor.

446
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,331
I suppose he came while
I was in the kitchen.

447
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,868
Well, that's really
all I came about.

448
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:25,622
I want the colonel to
have the first refusal.

449
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:27,266
You might tell him
the price I've quoted,

450
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,434
and let me know what he says.

451
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,627
Very good, mr. Trevor.

452
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,420
Oh, er...

453
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,007
Oh, well nevermind.

454
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:49,229
Mary.

455
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,189
Mary.

456
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:52,190
Where have you been?

457
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,609
Just for a turn
around the yard.

458
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,529
Did you have a look
at silver blaze?

459
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:01,116
No, I just went
for a breath of air.

460
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,578
By the way, is silver blaze

461
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,331
doing another trial tomorrow?

462
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,084
Yes, the last before the race.

463
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,877
Well, I'm for an early night.

464
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,464
There doesn't seem to
be much to stay up for.

465
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:05,597
Here, ted, wake up!

466
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,812
What the devil's happened?

467
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,401
Where's the guv'nor?

468
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,402
Where's the guv'nor?

469
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,112
Why isn't he in the yard?

470
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,073
What's up?

471
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,493
Is anything wrong
with silver blaze?

472
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,369
He's gone.

473
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,537
Gone?

474
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,205
Yes.

475
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,706
And hunter's dead.

476
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,211
Dead.

477
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:38,421
You must have a round
this morning, holmes.

478
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,648
Thank you, I should like to.

479
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:43,176
There're a few improvements
since you were here last.

480
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,343
Yes.

481
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,486
Hello, why it's ross.

482
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:02,612
Who's that with him?

483
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:04,155
Well, unless
I'm much mistaken,

484
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,657
that's my old friend lestrade,

485
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,992
recently a member of
the london police force

486
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,536
now transferred to exeter.

487
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,099
- Hello, ross.
- Morning, baskerville.

488
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,497
This is an early visit.

489
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,498
Hello, lestrade.

490
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:15,041
I didn't expect to
see you so soon.

491
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:16,602
You are mr. Sherlock
holmes I presume?

492
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,461
- Yes.
- And this is dr. Watson.

493
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,963
How do you do?

494
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:22,090
I'm told I could
find mr. Trevor here.

495
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,508
Why, yes, here is mr. Trevor.

496
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,469
I want a
word with you, mr. Trevor.

497
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,696
Say, ross, what's happened?

498
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,200
There's a devil
to pay, baskerville!

499
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,765
Last night silver
blaze was stolen!

500
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,643
Hunter my head lad poisoned
and straker has vanished!

501
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:35,186
What's this got
to do with jack?

502
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,771
That's what I'm
here to find out.

503
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,374
Well, perhaps we'd
better go indoors.

504
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,901
Come along, ross.

505
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:43,653
Now, mr. Trevor,

506
00:22:43,736 --> 00:22:44,821
I'm in charge of this case,

507
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:46,384
and I want to ask
you a few questions.

508
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:47,675
At the same time
I must warn you,

509
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,951
that anything you say
may be used in evidence.

510
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,661
You were at king's
pyland last night.

511
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,222
I rode over from
here after dinner, yes.

512
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,583
Why were you over at
king's pyland, mr. Trevor?

513
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,168
To see straker about
the sale of a polo pony.

514
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,461
- That all?
- Yes. Why?

515
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,690
You didn't make that an excuse
to try and get information

516
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,091
from the stable boys about
silver blaze for instance?

517
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:06,334
What the devil do you mean?

518
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,887
Not interested in
silver blaze perhaps?

519
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,389
I'm interested in
the race certainly,

520
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:13,349
so are thousands
of other people.

521
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,433
Now, mr. Trevor...

522
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:16,436
Just one moment, lestrade,

523
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,021
if you would allow me.

524
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:19,772
Mr. Trevor, you say
you've discussed

525
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,901
the sale of a polo
pony with mr. Straker.

526
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,819
Was anyone else present?

527
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,486
No.

528
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,322
What not even, mrs. Straker?

529
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,156
No.

530
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:28,823
Quite.

531
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,801
Now, mr. Trevor, you said
just now that you weren't

532
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:32,344
particularly interested
in silver blaze.

533
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:34,787
You haven't by any chance to
have your betting book on you?

534
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,247
I think so. Why?

535
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,249
Do you mind if I see it?

536
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,250
It's my duty to tell you

537
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,477
that I can't demand to see it.

538
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:41,419
Not now that is but...

539
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:45,006
Here it is.

540
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,052
I see you bet desborough,

541
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,654
the second favorite
to the barchester cup,

542
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:53,473
to win you 5,000
pounds, mr. Trevor.

543
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:55,141
Five thousand!

544
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:57,894
But, jack, you told me you
only had a few pounds on it.

545
00:23:57,977 --> 00:23:58,895
I'm sorry, dear.

546
00:23:58,978 --> 00:23:59,896
I had my own reasons.

547
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,459
Before you go any
further, lestrade,

548
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:02,666
may I ask if it's your intention

549
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,209
to apply for a warrant
against, mr. Trevor?

550
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:05,377
Not at the moment, mr. Holmes.

551
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,736
It was my duty to warn him.

552
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,947
I'm in your hands, inspector.

553
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,948
I won't run away.

554
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,151
As a justice of the peace,

555
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,201
I will be answerable
for mr. Trevor.

556
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,428
You'd better stay here, jack,

557
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,037
while the
investigation's going on.

558
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,330
Well, thank you, sir henry.

559
00:24:17,413 --> 00:24:18,873
Very well.

560
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,124
Now, mr. Holmes,

561
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,352
I may as well be frank with you.

562
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,754
There are things in this case
which completely baffle me.

563
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,422
Really, you surprise me.

564
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,650
I was saying to colonel ross

565
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,133
that I'd be glad of
your cooperation.

566
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,720
Well, the case certainly
has some points of interest,

567
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,390
but what does colonel ross say?

568
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,992
Personally, I should
prefer to leave the case

569
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:38,726
in the hands of the
official police force.

570
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,770
If you don't mind my
saying so, mr. Holmes,

571
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:42,772
I've not much use for
amateur detectives.

572
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,357
Oh, come, colonel, come.

573
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,733
Even they have their uses.

574
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,457
Of course I've heard
of you, mr. Holmes.

575
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,987
They say you've
never been beaten.

576
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,531
Well, it's true I've
been generally successful.

577
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,094
Well, I hope you
will be so with me.

578
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,076
I wish to leave
no stone unturned

579
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,370
to avenge straker
and recover my horse.

580
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:59,247
Very well, lestrade,
I am at your service.

581
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,849
Thank you, mr. Holmes,
I'll be getting along.

582
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,667
I'll see you later
at king's pyland.

583
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,335
Really, holmes,
I must protest.

584
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,979
You're down here to
recuperate you know.

585
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,147
Undoubtedly, my dear doctor,

586
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:09,590
but only last night
you suggested a tonic.

587
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,050
Well, here is one ready-made.

588
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,218
Yes, please, mr. Holmes,

589
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:13,886
for my sake and jack's.

590
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,015
Well, watson, that settles it.

591
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,849
Ms. Baskerville,

592
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:20,768
you may rely upon
my doing all I can.

593
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,996
I had to have the body taken

594
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,604
to the cottage to
make my examination.

595
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,524
But nothing else
has been disturbed.

596
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,168
Well, that hasn't
taken us long, colonel.

597
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,045
Oh, no, there are very
good roads in devonshire.

598
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,447
Mr. Holmes is coming
over from baskerville hall

599
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,650
to give us what help he can.

600
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,201
He's been some slight
assistance to me in the past,

601
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,579
and anyway he can't do any harm.

602
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:42,915
Here is mr. Holmes.

603
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,042
Dr solter,

604
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,269
mr. Sherlock holmes, dr. Watson.

605
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,753
How do you do?

606
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,629
This is silver blaze's box.

607
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:59,140
What in your opinion was
the cause of death, doctor?

608
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,367
An overdose of powdered opium.

609
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:02,310
In that case, he would
have died in his sleep.

610
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,144
That is so.

611
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:05,122
The remains of
the lad's supper I presume.

612
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,606
Yes,
curried mutton.

613
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:07,774
Oh, curry?

614
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,693
That significant, lestrade?

615
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,861
I don't know, mr. Holmes.

616
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,821
Any food containing
sufficient poison

617
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,906
could cause death.

618
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:15,907
Oh, would it really?

619
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,575
Really, I hadn't
thought of that.

620
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,160
You must read my
little monograph

621
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,037
on the whole art of poisoning.

622
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,455
Did the people of the house

623
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:24,040
partake of the same dish

624
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,041
without any ill effects?

625
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:26,042
Yes, mr. Holmes.

626
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,585
Well, then what
is your theory?

627
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,504
Mr. Trevor while standing
at the open window,

628
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,505
passed his hand through,

629
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,149
and placed the poison
in the curried mutton?

630
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,883
Exactly, and quite
easily as you can see.

631
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:35,301
Well, and then what?

632
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:37,720
He opened the door
with a duplicate key,

633
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,721
took out the horse,

634
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,324
and led it to some
secret hiding place?

635
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,867
The evidence against
him is very strong.

636
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,351
But, it's purely
circumstantial.

637
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:44,953
Well, it'd be equally
easy for the murderer

638
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:46,914
with the aid of a stick or
a hunting crop to pull back

639
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,855
the bolt of the door.

640
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:48,689
Yes, yes, yes.

641
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,274
Yes, quite easy as
you say, lestrade.

642
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,819
Where is the stable boy
who discovered the crime?

643
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,171
Somewhere outside in the yard.

644
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,279
Would you let me see him?

645
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,866
Certainly, I'll fetch him.

646
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,915
Your name, simpson?

647
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:06,749
Yes, sir.

648
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,043
Opium's a distinct
taste, is it not, doctor?

649
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,628
- Yes.
- Not unpleasant,

650
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:11,796
but quite distinct.

651
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:12,964
Oh, quite.

652
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:16,551
I thought so.

653
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,972
Is this the boy?

654
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,056
Yes.

655
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,890
Now my lad,

656
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,476
you say that mr. Trevor
dismounted at the gates

657
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,311
and asked you to
water his horse.

658
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,646
- Yes, sir.
- And then?

659
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:30,982
He went towards
the cottage, sir.

660
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:31,983
And in doing so,

661
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,318
he would, of course, have
to pass silver blaze's box.

662
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,820
Yes, sir, he went
along that side.

663
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:38,322
But you didn't actually
see him pass the box?

664
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,825
No, sir, I had my back to him.

665
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:41,617
Yes.

666
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,618
Thank you, that'll do.

667
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,203
You can go back
to your quarters.

668
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,371
Very good, sir.

669
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:47,307
Would you like to question
mrs. Straker, mr. Holmes?

670
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:48,249
Not at the moment.

671
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:49,333
By the way, colonel,

672
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,961
there's another training
stable quite close I believe.

673
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:52,795
Yes, capleton.

674
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,690
Silas brown trains lord
manston's horses there.

675
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,800
Lord manston's desborough
is second favorite.

676
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,884
Yes.

677
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,429
Then with the exception
of baskerville hall

678
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:02,430
and trevor's place,

679
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,515
your only neighbor
would be silas brown?

680
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,100
Yes, I phoned brown at once

681
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,811
on the discovery of the crime.

682
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,229
And he knows nothing?

683
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:10,897
No.

684
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,690
And there's nothing
to connect mr. Trevor

685
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:14,192
with the capleton stable?

686
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,737
Nothing.

687
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,738
By the way, colonel,

688
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:22,325
have you an old shoe
of silver blaze?

689
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:27,163
Yes, here.

690
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,834
- How about this one?
- Oh, yes.

691
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,668
Yeah, thank you.

692
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,213
Thank you, I'll put it
in my pocket for luck,

693
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,341
and have you a
photograph of the horse?

694
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:41,928
I think so.

695
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,098
Will this do?

696
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,642
Perfect.

697
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:51,062
Thank you.

698
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:51,979
Do you mind?

699
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,648
Not at all.

700
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,235
Now, watson, let us transfer
our activities to the moor.

701
00:29:03,282 --> 00:29:06,786
That building on the skyline
I presume is capleton.

702
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:09,080
Yes.

703
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,636
Look there's an
imprint of a hoof here.

704
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:26,013
Slight but quite distinct.

705
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,855
An exact fit.

706
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,776
And here a foot mark.

707
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,612
Good lord!

708
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,863
What's that?

709
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,658
Watson.

710
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,576
It's straker!

711
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,596
Obviously, he followed the
thief, caught him up here,

712
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,431
there was a struggle, and
he paid with his life.

713
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,959
And here's the torch he
used to trace the horse.

714
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,302
This is a very singular knife.

715
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,555
Surely, this is something
in your line, watson.

716
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,850
Oh, yes, it's what we
call a cataract knife.

717
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,268
Yeah.

718
00:30:12,351 --> 00:30:13,853
As I thought.

719
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:16,814
The price for very
delicate work.

720
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:19,358
It's a curious weapon
for defense, lestrade?

721
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,122
The best
he could lay hands on

722
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:22,278
at the moment I suppose.

723
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,529
Mm, yes.

724
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,614
Yes, very possible.

725
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:29,201
No trace of blood I perceive.

726
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,091
Why that's straker's coat.

727
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,843
This is curious, lestrade.

728
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:47,070
I What, mr. Holmes?

729
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:48,471
It looks as
though the murderer

730
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:52,058
let him take his coat
off before the struggle.

731
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,852
Couldn't he have
taken it off afterwards?

732
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:56,562
Well, that's one explanation.

733
00:30:56,645 --> 00:30:59,315
Though it's difficult
to see with what motive.

734
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,275
However, take it, lestrade,

735
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,479
and make a careful inventory

736
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:04,006
of everything you
find in the pockets.

737
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,987
Very good, mr. Holmes.

738
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,191
And now I suggest that you

739
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,674
and the colonel return
to king's pyland

740
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:09,468
and arrange for the
removal there of the body,

741
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,161
and then perhaps you'd be good
enough to meet us with a car

742
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:14,580
by that bridge in
say an hour's time.

743
00:31:14,663 --> 00:31:16,040
Dr. Watson and I are going

744
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:18,667
to take a little
walk over the moor.

745
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,751
Very good, mr. Holmes.

746
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,545
In an hour's time.

747
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,189
Now, watson, let
us leave the question

748
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,673
of who killed straker
for the moment,

749
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,967
and confine ourselves
to finding out

750
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,211
what has become of the horse.

751
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,738
Oh, how are you
going to set about it?

752
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,931
Well, a horse will
always herd with its kind.

753
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,241
Silver blaze, if
left to himself,

754
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:35,267
would either have
returned to king's pyland

755
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,560
or gone to capleton.

756
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,229
If my assumption is correct,

757
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:41,107
that is our direction.

758
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,067
Hoof prints again.

759
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,654
Let's carry on a little further.

760
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,490
Look, watson.

761
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,117
Here.

762
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,036
These are man's footprints
beside the horse's.

763
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,413
A man wearing square-toed boots.

764
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,123
But the horse
was alone before.

765
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,709
Precisely it was alone before.

766
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,675
Here we are here's
the same footprints.

767
00:32:07,758 --> 00:32:09,278
This time they're
coming from capleton.

768
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:12,847
- From capleton?
- Yes, let's follow the trail.

769
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,574
Looks in the pink doesn't he?

770
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:15,975
Yes,
ready for anything.

771
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:16,976
Aren't you desborough?

772
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,811
Let's see what is
in the betting today?

773
00:32:18,894 --> 00:32:21,188
Five to
one second favorite.

774
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,321
Look for anything, watson.

775
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,365
We don't want
any loiterers here.

776
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,952
I only want to ask a question.

777
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,497
Am I too early to
see mr. Silas brown?

778
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,665
Well, I don't know, sir.

779
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:41,028
He was up rather
late last night.

780
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,376
What's this, orson?

781
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,210
No gossiping!

782
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,211
Get on with your job!

783
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,839
Very good, sir.

784
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:49,049
And what the devil
do you want here?

785
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,760
Five minutes talk
with you my good, sir.

786
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,387
I've no time for talking!

787
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,972
And we don't want
no strangers here.

788
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:58,559
This is a matter
of vital importance.

789
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,691
It's a lie.

790
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:06,525
Very well.

791
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:10,112
Shall we talk it
over here or inside?

792
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,700
All right, come on.

793
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:16,823
I shan't keep you more
than a few minutes, watson.

794
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,704
Oh, that's
all right, holmes.

795
00:33:18,787 --> 00:33:22,291
Now, mr. Brown,
I'm at your service.

796
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:29,131
Well, I'm glad you realize

797
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,426
that it's no use
trying to bluff me.

798
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:42,520
Yes, that's quite a clever
bit of faking, brown.

799
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,543
Don't give me away.

800
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,835
I'll return the horse.

801
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,670
Very well,

802
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:11,257
but providing you
do as I tell you.

803
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,180
Now, brown, no tricks.

804
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,265
You understand?

805
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,641
I understand, sir.

806
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:22,977
Your instructions shall
be carried out faithfully.

807
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,063
Very well, you'll
guard him night and day

808
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,941
and engage a special
detective escort

809
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:30,168
when you take him to barchester.

810
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:32,570
I will do everything
you say, sir.

811
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,821
The horse shall be there.

812
00:34:33,904 --> 00:34:35,281
Very well.

813
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,032
But remember...

814
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,369
You may trust me, sir.

815
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:41,036
Yes.

816
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,623
Yes, I think can.

817
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,836
I'm sorry to keep you, watson.

818
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:49,837
Oh, it's all right.

819
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,147
Well, the more
perfect compound

820
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,424
of a bully and coward
than silas brown,

821
00:34:53,507 --> 00:34:54,425
I've seldom met really.

822
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:55,593
The horse is there then?

823
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,195
Yes, of course he
tried to bluff it out,

824
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:58,679
but I described
to him so exactly

825
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,202
what his actions
had been last night,

826
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,784
that he's convinced
I was watching him.

827
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,851
Well, what actually
happened, holmes?

828
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,352
I'll tell you.

829
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,397
Now I must go and collect
mr. Holmes and dr. Watson.

830
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,024
I must say I haven't
had much hope

831
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:11,251
of their having found the horse.

832
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,778
I'll be here
when you come back.

833
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:30,878
But surely brown was
running a tremendous risk.

834
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:34,465
Oh, my dear watson, silas
is an old horse faker.

835
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:36,717
He left nothing to chance.

836
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,510
You actually saw the horse?

837
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,178
Yes.

838
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:40,405
Well, I must say this for silas,

839
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,930
he certainly made
a good job of it.

840
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,658
But aren't you afraid
to leave it with him?

841
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:44,600
No, my dear fellow,

842
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:46,202
he'd as guard it as
the apple of his eye.

843
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,770
He knows that his
only hope of mercy

844
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,104
is to produce it safe.

845
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,315
Horse stealing is
a serious crime.

846
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:53,038
Colonel ross doesn't
impress me as a man

847
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:54,753
who'd be likely to show
much mercy in any case.

848
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,738
Well, the matter doesn't
rest with colonel ross.

849
00:35:57,821 --> 00:35:58,739
I follow my own methods,

850
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,784
and tell as much or
as little as I choose.

851
00:36:01,867 --> 00:36:03,678
I don't know whether
you've observed it, watson,

852
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:07,206
but the colonel's manner to
me has been somewhat rude.

853
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,916
I'm inclined to keep
him in suspense.

854
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,119
Say nothing about the horse.

855
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,770
Of course not, holmes,
without your permission.

856
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,338
Good old watson.

857
00:36:14,421 --> 00:36:17,925
Here's lestrade with the car.

858
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,890
Well, mr. Holmes,
seen anything?

859
00:36:24,973 --> 00:36:28,477
Yes, we've seen some very
interesting things, lestrade.

860
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,979
Boots.

861
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,647
Boots?

862
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,234
Yes, square-toed boots.

863
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,404
Where
now, mr. Holmes?

864
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,656
Straker's cottage, please.

865
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,199
I hope mr. Holmes
won't be long.

866
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:43,742
I want to phone
the story through

867
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,411
in time for the six
o'clock edition.

868
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,787
Mr. Holmes,

869
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,038
I represent the western mail.

870
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,290
I understand you're
taking up this case.

871
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,126
No, no, certainly not.

872
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,329
I'm just holmes the busybody

873
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,880
retained by the police to
supply their deficiencies.

874
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:57,881
Oh, inspector.

875
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,508
There are several
points upon which

876
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:01,218
I should like to
ask your advice.

877
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:03,971
I must consider whether I
don't owe it to the public

878
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,640
to scratch the
horse immediately.

879
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,474
Certainly not.

880
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,678
I should let the name stand.

881
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,286
- My business with mr.
- Holmes now is private

882
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,770
- if you don't mind.
- Right you are.

883
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,022
I've got something
to go on with anyhow.

884
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,023
Good day, everybody.

885
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,668
I'm very glad to have
your heard opinion, sir.

886
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,294
Well, doctor, have you
made your examination?

887
00:37:18,318 --> 00:37:20,863
Yes. Straker was
killed by a savage blow

888
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:22,364
from some blunt heavy instrument

889
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,991
delivered with enormous force.

890
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,367
Lestrade let me see his coat.

891
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,493
You have it there.

892
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,538
Yes, here it is.

893
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:31,540
Thank you.

894
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:34,293
I presume you made the
inventory I asked for.

895
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:37,880
Trust me, mr. Holmes.

896
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:42,341
Letter in envelope.

897
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,052
London postmark.

898
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,387
Pipe.

899
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,723
Briarwood pipe, lestrade.

900
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:48,432
Pouch.

901
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,268
Pouch of sealskin.

902
00:37:51,351 --> 00:37:52,478
Matches.

903
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,104
They're fine.

904
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,691
Telegram.

905
00:38:00,694 --> 00:38:03,280
Handed in at coombe tracey.

906
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:06,867
Let's see what the
letter says first.

907
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:11,497
"Bingham and co. Financier.

908
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,766

909

"Yours faithfully,

915
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:35,187
Our friend straker
seems to have been

916
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,774
somewhat financially
embarrassed.

917
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,526
Now for the telegram.

918
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,569
"For cup final
send instructions.

919
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,906
"Will meet you as we agreed.

00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,407
"Martin."

921
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,202
I think mrs. Straker might
be able to help us here.

922
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:51,203
She's in her room.

923
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:52,764
- I'll fetch her.
- Thank you, doctor.

924
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,891
I don't think she'll be
much assistance, mr. Holmes.

925
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,999
Apparently, she and straker

926
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,543
went to bed about
the usual time.

927
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,395
When she woke up in the
morning, she found he'd gone.

928
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:01,272
Yet, still I'd like a word
or two with her, lestrade,

929
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:02,440
regarding her husband's habits.

930
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:05,175
No one like a wife
to tell you that.

931
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,093
Eh, watson?

932
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,719
Oh, yes, quite.

933
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,283
You remember I
have these, lestrade.

934
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,098
Pray don't think
it deliberately.

935
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:11,932
Not at all.

936
00:39:12,015 --> 00:39:12,933
You're welcome.

937
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:15,102
I see nothing in them.

938
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:22,484
Mr. Lestrade, have
you discovered anything?

939
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,485
No, mrs. Straker,

940
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,821
but mr. Holmes has
come over to help us.

941
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:29,408
We shall do all that's possible.

942
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,785
I won't be taking you
a moment, mrs. Straker.

943
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,372
I realize what
you're going through.

944
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,251
I just want to ask you this.

945
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,169
Are you by any chance
a light sleeper?

946
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,547
Yes, mr. Holmes,
as it happens I am.

947
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,923
I noticed a dog in the yard.

948
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,301
Does he sleep out
there at night?

949
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,260
Yes, always.

950
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:49,553
He's a very good watchdog.

951
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:50,721
You didn't by any chance

952
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:54,141
hear him barking
during the night?

953
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:57,728
No, I didn't.

954
00:39:58,478 --> 00:40:01,273
No.

955
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:04,026
No.

956
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,612
Just one other thing.

957
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,406
Was your husband
interested in football?

958
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:10,240
Oh, no.

959
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,093
Racing was the only thing
that interested him.

960
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:14,369
There's just one further
question, mrs. Straker.

961
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,330
You had curry for
supper last night.

962
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:19,917
Did you mention that to
anyone outside the house?

963
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,376
Why no.

964
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,604
Oh, thank you, mrs. Straker.

965
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,379
I don't think I need
intrude upon your time

966
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,839
and patience any longer.

967
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,426
Thank you, mr. Holmes.

968
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,971
Colonel, you have a
few sheep in the paddock.

969
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,058
Have you had anything
wrong with them of late?

970
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:38,310
No, I don't think so.

971
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,205
Now you mention it I believe
that one of my stable lads

972
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:43,357
did report that three of
the sheep had gone lame.

973
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,733
Why do you ask?

974
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:47,569
It was just a
long shot, colonel.

975
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,570
A very long shot.

976
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,114
Lestrade, let me recommend
to your attention

977
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,116
the singular epidemic
among the sheep.

978
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,160
You consider it
important, mr. Holmes?

979
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:56,828
Oh, yes, yes, exceedingly so.

980
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,996
Is there any other point

981
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,873
to which you want to
draw my attention?

982
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,625
Well, to the curious incident

983
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,543
of the dog in the night time.

984
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,462
The dog was perfectly
quiet in the night.

985
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:08,548
No that was the
curious incident.

986
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:12,135
Well, I'm going to
baskerville hall.

987
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,136
Would you be following?

988
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,723
Yes, it's very
possible, lestrade.

989
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,020
Hello?

990
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:22,688
Hello?

991
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,274
Hello, could you please give
me coombe tracey post office?

992
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,234
Yes.

993
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:28,360
Yes, I'll hold on.

994
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:30,195
Coombe tracey is a small
village, is it not?

995
00:41:30,278 --> 00:41:31,398
Yes, just a hamlet.

996
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,615
Then the postmaster
would be likely to remember

997
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,117
any strangers who came into it.

998
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,785
I should think so.

999
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:37,452
Hello.

1000
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,455
Hello, is that the
postmaster of coombe tracey?

1001
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,583
Look I'm speaking for mr.
Straker of king's pyland.

1002
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,461
He received a telegram
yesterday signed martin

1003
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,838
dispatched from your office.

1004
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,923
But he cannot recall
anybody of that name.

1005
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,301
Could you kindly describe
the sender to me?

1006
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,888
Yes.

1007
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,893
Oh, there were two of them?

1008
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:04,062
I see thank you.

1009
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:04,896
Thank you.

1010
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,124
I'm very much obliged to you.

1011
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,607
You think the
telegram's important?

1012
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,735
Very much so, watson.

1013
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:10,986
Well, au revoir, colonel.

1014
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:12,446
We've had a charming
little breath

1015
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,406
of your beautiful dartmoor air.

1016
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:15,675
Then you despair of arresting

1017
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,843
the murderer of james straker?

1018
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,095
Well, there are certainly
grave difficulties in the way,

1019
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,680
but I've every hope that
your horse will start,

1020
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,598
and I think you will have
your jockey in readiness.

1021
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:24,183
And you've nothing
definite to tell me?

1022
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,711
When we meet at
the races, colonel.

1023
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,552
What do you make
of it all, holmes?

1024
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:38,013
Hmm, it's easy as looking at
love at first sight, watson.

1025
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,766
But the fact that straker was
not interested in football

1026
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,186
persuaded me that this is not
to be taken at its face value.

1027
00:42:44,269 --> 00:42:46,938
You observed of course that
the name of martin appeared

1028
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,774
in both the letter
and the telegram.

1029
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,084
Yes, it struck me as curious.

1030
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,319
Yes, highly
significant, watson.

1031
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:54,821
This telegram is
peculiarly interesting.

1032
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,822
You mean it's in code?

1033
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,700
Yes, and a very
elementary one.

1034
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,386
By simply crossing out
each alternate word,

1035
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,371
the message assumes an
entirely different meaning.

1036
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,958
Instead of a request it
becomes a peremptory order.

1037
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:12,047
"Final instructions.

1038
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,967
"Meet as agreed.

1039
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,010
"Martin."

1040
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,930
What did the postmaster
at coombe tracey tell you?

1041
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:22,307
He described the senders.

1042
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,141
Two strangers.

1043
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,728
Unquestionably,
moriarty and moran.

1044
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:29,231
Watson, the professor
is behind all this.

1045
00:43:29,314 --> 00:43:30,398
You mean he's responsible

1046
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,192
for the deaths of
hunter and straker?

1047
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,193
Of hunter, yes.

1048
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:34,861
Of straker, no.

1049
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,385
In fact, I fancy
that straker's death

1050
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:39,574
was the most unfortunate thing
that could possibly happen

1051
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,077
from moriarty's point of view.

1052
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,664
All through the season
my luck was dead out.

1053
00:43:45,872 --> 00:43:49,376
I found myself in trouble
to the tune of 4,000 pounds.

1054
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:54,005
I went to bingham and
raise what I could,

1055
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,801
and as a last plunge I backed
desborough to win me 5,000.

1056
00:43:57,884 --> 00:43:58,969
Make or break.

1057
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:00,929
Well, why didn't
you come to me my boy?

1058
00:44:01,012 --> 00:44:02,573
Well, you're not a
betting man, sir henry,

1059
00:44:02,597 --> 00:44:04,766
and I was afraid you
wouldn't understand.

1060
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,810
That's why I kept it dark.

1061
00:44:06,893 --> 00:44:07,644
Even from diana.

1062
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:09,122
And now that
loathsome, inspector...

1063
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,357
Oh, come now it's no
use calling him names.

1064
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,358
In view of these bets,

1065
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:14,943
he'd every reason
to be suspicious.

1066
00:44:15,026 --> 00:44:16,746
I don't care he's a
foul and nasty person.

1067
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,323
I disliked him from the
first moment I met him.

1068
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,200
Inspector lestrade.

1069
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,201
Any news, inspector?

1070
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,744
Yes, very grave
news, sir henry.

1071
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,121
We found straker's body.

1072
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:27,289
Body do you mean he's...

1073
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:28,498
Murdered.

1074
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,501
On the moor about a
mile from king's pyland.

1075
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,463
Sherlock holmes
takes up the case.

1076
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,257
Sherlock holmes, moran!

1077
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,885
Once again that man
is crossing my path!

1078
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,220
What's this news
mean, professor?

1079
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,305
What's gone wrong?

1080
00:44:43,388 --> 00:44:44,532
What does this man holmes know?

1081
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,826
I tell you if silver blaze goes
to the post and he's fit...

1082
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,768
There is a big
difference mr. Stanford

1083
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,355
between a horse going to the
post and winning the race.

1084
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:54,399
You have my assurance.

1085
00:44:54,482 --> 00:44:57,986
I am not in the habit
of failing my clients.

1086
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:01,615
Moran, tell barton to
take mr. Stanford home.

1087
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,700
Then come straight back.

1088
00:45:03,783 --> 00:45:07,120
Yes, sir.

1089
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,547
Prince?

1090
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,090
It's now four o'clock.

1091
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,052
Have the car ready
in 15 minutes.

1092
00:45:22,135 --> 00:45:23,803
Very good, professor.

1093
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,180
Are we out for a long run?

1094
00:45:25,263 --> 00:45:26,014
Er, yes.

1095
00:45:26,097 --> 00:45:29,601
We've got to be back in
devon well before midnight,

1096
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:33,688
and, prince,

1097
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,607
we'll need the gun.

1098
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,194
Okay.

1099
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,542
What have you
got there, prince?

1100
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,479
Oh, you haven't
seen this little gadget

1101
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,503
- before have you?
- No.

1102
00:45:57,545 --> 00:45:59,106
You hadn't joined us
when it was last used.

1103
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,048
Let's have a look.

1104
00:46:00,131 --> 00:46:01,216
It's a magazine airgun.

1105
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:02,818
Absolutely silent and
immensely powerful.

1106
00:46:02,842 --> 00:46:04,302
Made specially for
the, professor,

1107
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,845
by a well-known
foreign gunsmith.

1108
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,391
Hmm, seems you're
gonna use it again.

1109
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:11,309
Oh, there you are, barton.

1110
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,896
I want you to take
mr. Stanford home.

1111
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,400
Yes, we're in deeper waters
than you think, lestrade.

1112
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:21,319
But we must take the
case one step at a time.

1113
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,280
Now our progress so
far I'm glad to say

1114
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,156
is completely to
exonerate mr. Trevor.

1115
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,534
You've got to
convince me, mr. Holmes.

1116
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:29,077
I've every hope of doing so.

1117
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,578
Now you will agree that hunter

1118
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,873
was murdered in order that
the horse could be stolen.

1119
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,292
Exactly, we all know that.

1120
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,378
When I examined the
remains of hunter's supper,

1121
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:41,673
I remarked on the fact
that it consisted of curry.

1122
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:42,924
Yes, but I still don't see.

1123
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,677
Well, perhaps I
could help you to see,

1124
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,904
one or two other things as well.

1125
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:49,514
That was the first link
in my chain of reasoning.

1126
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:51,474
Hunter was poisoned
with powdered opium

1127
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,102
and powdered opium is
by no means tasteless.

1128
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:56,038
Well, then, mr. Holmes,
why didn't the boy notice it?

1129
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:59,566
By no mean tasteless when
mixed with any ordinary dish.

1130
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:02,277
Curry was exactly the medium

1131
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,280
which would disguise that taste.

1132
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:05,947
So?

1133
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,534
You remember that
I asked mrs. Straker

1134
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,203
if she'd told anyone
they were having curry

1135
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,204
for supper that night,

1136
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,497
and she replied no.

1137
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,708
Yes, I remember you
putting that question.

1138
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:19,085
Well, it's surely too
monstrous a coincidence

1139
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,962
to suppose that trevor
happened to come along

1140
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,505
with powdered opium
on the very night

1141
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,800
when a dish was served which
would disguise its flavor.

1142
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,028
Why it's unthinkable, lestrade.

1143
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,852
That certainly
is a strong point.

1144
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:30,597
And there's a further point.

1145
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,849
Even more significant, lestrade.

1146
00:47:32,932 --> 00:47:34,684
The silence of the dog.

1147
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:36,603
Though someone had
been in the stable

1148
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:37,771
and fetched out the horse,

1149
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:38,998
the dog had not barked enough

1150
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,649
to arouse mrs. Straker
who is a light sleeper.

1151
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,853
I mean obviously the visitor

1152
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,361
was some member
of the household.

1153
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,924
Then what do you
make of it, holmes?

1154
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:47,113
One thing for certain.

1155
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,700
Trevor becomes
eliminated from the case.

1156
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:52,869
Well, I confess, mr. Holmes,

1157
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:54,621
in view of what you say,

1158
00:47:54,704 --> 00:47:56,331
I don't know what move to make.

1159
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:58,166
Make no move at the moment.

1160
00:47:58,249 --> 00:47:59,334
Except to assure mr. Trevor

1161
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,921
that all suspicions
of him were unfounded.

1162
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,548
We're old friends.

1163
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,051
It's wrongful to arrest
the future son-in-law

1164
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:09,928
of sir henry baskerville.

1165
00:48:10,011 --> 00:48:11,554
I appreciate that.

1166
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,722
I'll speak to mr. Trevor.

1167
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,474
Who's that taking
my name in vain?

1168
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:15,475
Ah, mr. Trevor.

1169
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:17,352
I just had a little
chat with, mr. Holmes.

1170
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:20,105
I'm glad to say that he
sees eye to eye with me.

1171
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,041
You quite understand that at
the commencement of this case

1172
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,568
it was my duty to follow up
any clue, however slight.

1173
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,772
I don't mind telling you now

1174
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,214
that I never seriously
suspected you.

1175
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,007
Well, he can't say
fairer than that, can he?

1176
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,218
Well, I'm very glad you feel
that way about it, inspector.

1177
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,536
Yes, I still don't
see how it helps us.

1178
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,996
Who did put the
opium into the curry?

1179
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,997
Who did steal the horse

1180
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,201
and kill hunter and straker?

1181
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,810
My dear lestrade,
it's a capital mistake

1182
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,129
to theorize before you
have all the evidence.

1183
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,130
It biases the judgment.

1184
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,358
Then you're not going to
tell us anything, mr. Holmes?

1185
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,818
Well, not at the
moment, ms. Baskerville.

1186
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,694
There's one other link in
the chain to be tested,

1187
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:54,222
and to do that I'm afraid we
must return to london tonight.

1188
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,140
Tonight?

1189
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,683
Yes, dr. Watson
and I are sorry

1190
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,101
to have to run away like this.

1191
00:48:58,184 --> 00:48:59,328
Well, there's nothing before

1192
00:48:59,352 --> 00:49:00,496
the midnight train from exeter.

1193
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,000
Dinner will be ready
in a few moments.

1194
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:03,565
You have heaps of
time to dine here

1195
00:49:03,648 --> 00:49:04,732
in comfort before you go.

1196
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,336
Well, thank you I
shall be delighted.

1197
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,695
I hope you'll stay
and dine too, inspector.

1198
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:12,282
Oh, thank you, sir.

1199
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,606
That's quite a museum
piece, sir henry.

1200
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:46,274
Well, we've had
it a long time.

1201
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:47,501
Why it's nearly 11:00, holmes,

1202
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:50,111
and if we're to catch that
midnight train from exeter...

1203
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,112
I'll order the car.

1204
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,280
Don't bother, sir henry.

1205
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:53,841
I'll take mr. Holmes
and the doctor in mine.

1206
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:54,949
Oh, thank you, lestrade.

1207
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,510
It's a pity you've
got to leave us holmes,

1208
00:49:56,534 --> 00:49:58,012
and I'm sorry you
can't tell us anymore.

1209
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,871
You are leaving three
very puzzled people.

1210
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:01,414
Well, I hope to
solve the puzzle

1211
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,001
for you all on cup day
in colonel ross's box.

1212
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,096
What's happening?

1213
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,390
I think he's going, moran.

1214
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,622
Well, that can't be helped.

1215
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,314
- No.
- Au revoir, holmes.

1216
00:50:26,397 --> 00:50:27,148
Safe journey.

1217
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,149
Thank you so much.

1218
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,027
Goodbye.

1219
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:47,043
Quick back to the car.

1220
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:51,339
Follow that car.

1221
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:54,926
When you get clear of
the house overtake her.

1222
00:51:04,602 --> 00:51:06,413
I have the strongest
reasons for thinking that

1223
00:51:06,437 --> 00:51:08,437
professor moriarty is the
brains behind this crime.

1224
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:11,234
You know he seems quite
an obsession with you.

1225
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:13,486
You still don't
believe in the professor?

1226
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,713
Frankly, mr. Holmes, I do not.

1227
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:18,241
Another few yards, moran,
then let them have it.

1228
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,329
Oh, no.

1229
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,416
There's a car following us.

1230
00:51:28,793 --> 00:51:30,461
Quick down for your lives.

1231
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,553
Help!

1232
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:56,321
Dear.

1233
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,780
What are you hurt, watson?

1234
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,282
No only a few bruises,

1235
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,367
but where's the driver?

1236
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,451
Here I am, sir.

1237
00:52:02,493 --> 00:52:03,578
I'm all right.

1238
00:52:03,661 --> 00:52:04,787
Sure?

1239
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,289
No bones broken?

1240
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:08,207
My word this is a lucky escape.

1241
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,586
Oh, but where's lestrade?

1242
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:17,592
Watson, have you seen lestrade?

1243
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:19,385
Lestrade?

1244
00:52:24,098 --> 00:52:26,059
Ah, there you are, lestrade.

1245
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:29,646
Well, do you believe in
professor moriarty now?

1246
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:58,049
Double price, silver blaze?

1247
00:52:58,132 --> 00:52:59,050
Six to one, sir.

1248
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:01,052
I'll take 60 pounds to 10.

1249
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:03,805
Silver blaze 60 pounds to 10.

1250
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:05,807
Five, six, nine.

1251
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,975
- Thank you.
- Silver blaze five to one.

1252
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:25,118
May I borrow your
glass, mr. Holmes?

1253
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,663
Thank you.

1254
00:53:28,746 --> 00:53:31,124
Did you hear anything
from the street, dudley?

1255
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:34,210
Well, they told me
sunstroke has a good chance.

1256
00:53:34,293 --> 00:53:35,211
Oh, mr. Holmes.

1257
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:37,374
You've assured me that my
horse would go to the post.

1258
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:40,299
We are still waiting to know
who killed straker and hunter.

1259
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,886
I promised you should know
everything today, colonel,

1260
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,763
and you shall.

1261
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:49,350
Oh, watson you've been having
a little flutter I see.

1262
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,017
What?

1263
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,477
Well, if you
want to conceal it,

1264
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,397
I suggest you find a deeper
pocket for your betting ticket.

1265
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,941
It's all very
well, mr. Holmes.

1266
00:53:57,024 --> 00:53:57,942
But we are waiting.

1267
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,545
Yes, well, colonel,
in the first place,

1268
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,463
it will come as a shock to
you to learn that straker

1269
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:04,824
was a scoundrel utterly
unworthy of your confidence.

1270
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:06,051
Are you serious, mr. Holmes?

1271
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:07,219
Yes, acting under the orders

1272
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,120
of a master criminal
who bought up his debts,

1273
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:11,456
and so had it in his
power to ruin him.

1274
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,915
He poisoned hunter,

1275
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,083
and then took silver blaze

1276
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,668
out on the moor in
the dead of night.

1277
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,629
- Oh, thank you.
- I can hardly believe it.

1278
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,839
Straker?

1279
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:20,840
But to what purpose?

1280
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:23,926
It was his intention to
use that singular knife,

1281
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,595
you remember I found
it in his hand,

1282
00:54:25,678 --> 00:54:27,197
to nick one of the
tendons of the horse.

1283
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:29,032
With your wide experience
of the turf, colonel,

1284
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:32,185
you know it's possible
to do that subcutaneously

1285
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:33,186
and leave no trace.

1286
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,749
The result would be
a slight lameness,

1287
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:36,292
which you would put
down to rheumatism

1288
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:37,273
or a strain in exercise.

1289
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:38,500
You say it was his intention?

1290
00:54:38,524 --> 00:54:40,193
You mean he didn't succeed?

1291
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:40,860
No.

1292
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:41,943
I examined the knife.

1293
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:43,106
There was no trace of blood.

1294
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,239
But why didn't he do
all this in the stable?

1295
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,467
Why take him out on the moor?

1296
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,451
Well, for the best of reasons.

1297
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:50,161
When so spirited a
creature felt the nick

1298
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,871
of the knife he
would certainly have

1299
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,098
roused the soundest of sleepers.

1300
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:56,626
But how did you arrive
at all this, mr. Holmes?

1301
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,586
I found several clues.

1302
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:01,047
Chief of which was the knife.

1303
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,298
You remember my asking you

1304
00:55:02,381 --> 00:55:03,901
if you've found anything
wrong with your sheep?

1305
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,045
Yes, I remember.

1306
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:06,594
When you told me
that some of them

1307
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:09,013
had suffered from lameness
that confirmed my theory.

1308
00:55:09,096 --> 00:55:10,216
That straker before tackling

1309
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:12,099
the delicate
operation on the horse

1310
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,976
had been practicing
on the sheep.

1311
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,728
Good heavens!

1312
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,480
But who interrupted the plot?

1313
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:18,648
Who killed james straker?

1314
00:55:18,731 --> 00:55:22,235
I'll waive that question
for a few minutes, colonel.

1315
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:24,403
Hello, the numbers are going up.

1316
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,571
Oh, should we go?

1317
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,799
What number is silver blaze?

1318
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,366
- Nine.
- Number nine.

1319
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:41,420
Two three.

1320
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,131
Four five.

1321
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,551
Six.

1322
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,135
Merton number six?

1323
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,096
Why my jockey's
riding another horse.

1324
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:53,015
What silver blaze doesn't run.

1325
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:53,850
Look holmes.

1326
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,018
Silver blaze doesn't run.

1327
00:56:00,064 --> 00:56:01,941
There's been a mistake.

1328
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:05,528
The six should've been a nine.

1329
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,447
Mr. Holmes, I relied
on you implicitly.

1330
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,367
Yes, and you may
still do so, colonel.

1331
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,838
Yes, that's him?

1332
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:25,121
- There he goes.
- Is that him?

1333
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:26,173
That's my horse.

1334
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:31,929
That's my horse!

1335
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,516
Yes, and that's the
murderer of james straker.

1336
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,517
- What?
- What?

1337
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:40,104
It was a kick from silver
blaze that killed your trainer.

1338
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:01,541
They're off.

1339
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,479
Here they come.

1340
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:23,481
Confound it, desborough leads.

1341
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,620
Oh, here comes silver blaze.

1342
00:57:37,703 --> 00:57:40,289
Come on silver blaze.

1343
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,958
Come on silver blaze.

1344
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,335
They're neck and neck.

1345
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:49,840
Silver blaze.

1346
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,718
Come on, silver blaze, come on.

1347
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,222
It's my race!

1348
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,305
It's my race!

1349
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:04,647
But he's off.

1350
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,730
Oh, holmes.

1351
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:08,693
Look desborough wins!

1352
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:09,860
Desborough!

1353
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,782
The bullet has
penetrated the shoulder

1354
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,033
and lodged near the lung.

1355
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,034
But we heard nothing.

1356
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,285
You wouldn't.

1357
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,204
It was fired from an airgun.

1358
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,431
Noiseless with tremendous power.

1359
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:23,415
How could it possibly
be concealed in the crowd?

1360
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,793
In the interior of
a specially designed

1361
00:58:25,876 --> 00:58:27,086
kinematic-graph camera.

1362
00:58:27,169 --> 00:58:28,169
Good heavens.

1363
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:29,356
But how on earth do you know?

1364
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,860
Well, I observed
through the glasses

1365
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,963
a group of cameramen lined
up near the winning post.

1366
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,152
I fancied I knew one of them.

1367
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:35,656
Mr. Holmes, what
does this all mean?

1368
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,764
It means, colonel, that
you've been cheated of your race

1369
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,184
by the most cunning and
dangerous criminal in london.

1370
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,687
Is there nothing to be done?

1371
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,313
Lestrade, who's
the most likely man

1372
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,557
to give me some information
on the betting for the cup?

1373
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:50,568
It's difficult to say.

1374
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:52,451
Old sam silver's a member
of the victoria club

1375
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:54,381
- and a good friend of mine.
- Where can we find him?

1376
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,549
It's a 100 to one he's in the

1377
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,717
champagne bar at this moment.

1378
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,161
I'll stay here with
muffin if you don't mind.

1379
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:01,388
There's no question about it.

1380
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:04,915
Stanford had laid over 100,000
pounds against silver blaze

1381
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:06,959
and got left with it.

1382
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,960
Point him out to me.

1383
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,629
There he is mr. Holmes in
the dark suit and the bowler.

1384
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,173
Thank
you, mr. Silver.

1385
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:15,217
Watson, I want you to take
particular note of that man.

1386
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,886
Not a word sam.

1387
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:17,720
Trust me.

1388
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:18,721
Excuse me, mr. Holmes.

1389
00:59:18,804 --> 00:59:20,347
You can rely on me
to look after this.

1390
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,058
Yes, yes, but I think you need

1391
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,517
a little unofficial help.

1392
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,894
Just to supplement your usual

1393
00:59:24,977 --> 00:59:27,396
happy mixture of
cunning and audacity.

1394
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,065
Is there anything I can do?

1395
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,443
Yes, my dear watson.

1396
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:34,236
A job that involves
tenacity of purpose

1397
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,823
of which, my dear fellow,
you've given me so many proofs.

1398
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,575
I want you to remain here

1399
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:41,118
and never lose
sight of stanford.

1400
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:43,788
Lestrade, and I will drive
straight back to baker street.

1401
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,081
- Yes.
- Lestrade, will you

1402
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,308
give instructions for your car

1403
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,476
to be at dr. Watson's disposal?

1404
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,417
Certainly, mr. Holmes.

1405
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,312
And you might tell you
chauffeur to get into muffin.

1406
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,838
As soon as stanford
leaves follow him.

1407
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,381
When he arrives at
his destination,

1408
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,300
send the car back
to baker street.

1409
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:57,611
Then go to the nearest phone box

1410
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,887
and tell me where you
are and wait for me.

1411
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,764
- Is that clear?
- Perfectly.

1412
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:03,366
Watson's
a long time phoning.

1413
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,768
Oh, patience,
lestrade, patience.

1414
01:00:05,851 --> 01:00:07,186
Concentrate on the game.

1415
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,813
Yes, come in.

1416
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:13,109
Mr. Holmes, it's
nearly midnight.

1417
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,194
You really must eat something.

1418
01:00:15,277 --> 01:00:17,279
Can't I tempt you to
a nice bit of haddock?

1419
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:18,280
My dear mrs. Hudson,

1420
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,741
you've always been
a temptation to me,

1421
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,619
but haddock at
this moment is not.

1422
01:00:23,702 --> 01:00:27,206
How about a nice sheepshead?

1423
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:31,710
No, thank you, mrs. Hudson.

1424
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,714
I suggest you go
to bed, mrs. Hudson.

1425
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,967
Very well, sir.

1426
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,642
Still
your move, lestrade.

1427
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,609
My mind's not on
the game, mr. Holmes.

1428
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:59,196
I wonder what has
happened to dr. Watson.

1429
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:01,907
Well, now let's see.

1430
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,494
It was five o'clock when we
left the course and it's now...

1431
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,499
Oh, look now it's
nearly midnight.

1432
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,751
We ought to hear something soon.

1433
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,752
Tell me, mr. Holmes,

1434
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,963
why did you leave dr.
Watson to do the trailing?

1435
01:01:16,046 --> 01:01:16,964
Why not yourself?

1436
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:18,167
Because my dear, lestrade,

1437
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:19,442
when you set out
to draw a badger

1438
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:22,595
that's gone to earth you
send a ferret down after it

1439
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:25,389
while the man with the
gun remains outside.

1440
01:01:25,472 --> 01:01:27,975
Professor moriarty
is the badger,

1441
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:29,143
dr. Watson is the ferret,

1442
01:01:29,226 --> 01:01:32,730
and I my dear lestrade
am the man with the gun.

1443
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,482
I see.

1444
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,317
And stanford?

1445
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,860
Well, stanford,
if he's a wise man,

1446
01:01:37,943 --> 01:01:39,063
will go straight to moriarty

1447
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,654
with whatever price he's paying.

1448
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:56,771
When you're finished
with the professor,

1449
01:01:56,795 --> 01:01:58,635
you'll be taken back to
where we picked you up.

1450
01:01:58,714 --> 01:02:00,966
You've got the necessary
on you I suppose.

1451
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,801
Yes, of course.

1452
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,388
Okay.

1453
01:02:12,811 --> 01:02:13,896
I want you to go straight

1454
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:16,482
to mr. Holmes' rooms
in baker street.

1455
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,430
Yes?

1456
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:49,431
Is that you holmes?

1457
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,767
Watson speaking
from sladen mews.

1458
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:02,528
Watson!

1459
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,405
Quick, lestrade,
there's something wrong!

1460
01:03:04,488 --> 01:03:05,406
They've got, watson!

1461
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:06,925
Inspector lestrade's
chauffeur, sir.

1462
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,843
Good, drive us to
where you dropped dr. Watson!

1463
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:12,371
- Right.
- Oh, dear.

1464
01:03:14,331 --> 01:03:16,375
Quite correct, mr. Stanford.

1465
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:17,602
I must say this case has proved

1466
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,628
more intricate
than I anticipated.

1467
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,589
It should have been
worth a trifle more.

1468
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:25,718
However, perhaps next time.

1469
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:27,177
You may go.

1470
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,554
Barton.

1471
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:30,597
Here.

1472
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,541
Next to mr. Holmes himself,

1473
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:43,068
I don't know anyone
who'd be more welcome.

1474
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,371
Hello, professor?

1475
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,791
Who do you think I've
got here of all people?

1476
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,669
No.

1477
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,629
Doctor watson.

1478
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:06,633
Watson did you say?

1479
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,468
Doctor watson?

1480
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:11,055
- What's he doing here?
- Moran.

1481
01:04:12,097 --> 01:04:14,224
Yes.

1482
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:14,892
Yes.

1483
01:04:14,975 --> 01:04:17,019
Caught him prowling
around the yard.

1484
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:18,102
Shall I bring him in?

1485
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,688
No, not just yet, prince.

1486
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:23,275
I'll leave him alone with
this thoughts for a while.

1487
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:27,112
Nothing like a little suspense.

1488
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,992
I imagine the three weeks'
wait for the hangman

1489
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:35,746
is infinitely worse than
the final interview.

1490
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:40,084
Eh, moran?

1491
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,096
- You wait here.
- Right, sir.

1492
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,180
Come, lestrade.

1493
01:04:53,263 --> 01:04:55,766
This is the mews.

1494
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:28,674
This looks pretty
solid, lestrade.

1495
01:05:28,757 --> 01:05:30,235
- What building is it?
- This must be the back

1496
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,762
of the old pelham
street tube station.

1497
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,940
What are you going
to do, mr. Holmes?

1498
01:05:45,023 --> 01:05:46,483
Drive straight
to scotland yard.

1499
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,943
- And then?
- The headquarters

1500
01:05:48,026 --> 01:05:49,153
of the london transport.

1501
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,739
Now, moran, I think
we'll interview the doctor.

1502
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:57,828
Is that you, prince?

1503
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:00,038
Bring in dr. Watson.

1504
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,625
Right now.

1505
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,885
Now then, doctor.

1506
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:23,896
This should be
most amusing moran.

1507
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,483
Ah, come in, doctor.

1508
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,567
I have had the pleasure

1509
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,527
of several interviews
with mr. Holmes,

1510
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:34,114
but never before with his
talented friend and colleague.

1511
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:39,453
Would you sit down?

1512
01:06:43,957 --> 01:06:47,461
May I ask what you are
doing in this neighborhood?

1513
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:48,795
I'd good reason to think

1514
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,506
it was your
neighborhood, professor.

1515
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,007
Really?

1516
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:55,594
As a matter of curiosity may
I ask you how you got here?

1517
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,014
- By following mr.
- Holmes' instructions.

1518
01:06:59,097 --> 01:07:00,974
Oh, I see.

1519
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,202
I'm afraid it's going to prove

1520
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:05,729
rather unfortunate
for you, doctor.

1521
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,232
I have not taken the somewhat

1522
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,610
elaborate precautions to
conceal my whereabouts

1523
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:15,197
in order to have you report
on the subject to, mr. Holmes.

1524
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,699
You mean...

1525
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,576
I'm going to have some
difficulty in leaving?

1526
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,995
Oh, no, my dear doctor.

1527
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,497
Oh, dear no.

1528
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,624
There will be no
difficulty about that.

1529
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:29,211
But you will leave by
the way I shall indicate.

1530
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:33,966
I will explain to you, doctor.

1531
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:43,016
You are now in what was the
pelham street tube station.

1532
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:47,980
Behind that panel
is the lift shaft.

1533
01:07:48,063 --> 01:07:50,190
It's a sheer drop of 80 feet.

1534
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:53,777
If you have any last message
to send to mr. Holmes,

1535
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:58,132
I will see that it is delivered.

1536
01:07:58,156 --> 01:08:00,951
Sherlock holmes will fall
a reckoning with you moriarty

1537
01:08:01,034 --> 01:08:03,245
without any reminder from me.

1538
01:08:03,328 --> 01:08:06,832
So that is your last word?

1539
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,714
Very good.

1540
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,966
I will now remove the panel

1541
01:08:16,049 --> 01:08:18,969
and wish you a swift journey.

1542
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,813
Don't move any of you.

1543
01:08:29,896 --> 01:08:30,981
Except you my dear watson

1544
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:33,567
who I'm sure would be
more comfortable with us.

1545
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,527
You must excuse
me for trespassing

1546
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,695
on your private property.

1547
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:39,114
I've had the lift
put in order again.

1548
01:08:39,197 --> 01:08:41,283
You clever...

1549
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:42,284
No compliments please.

1550
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,119
I arrest
you robert moriarty.

1551
01:08:44,202 --> 01:08:45,120
On what charge?

1552
01:08:45,203 --> 01:08:46,563
For being concerned
in the murder

1553
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,765
of the stable boy edward hunter.

1554
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:48,933
And for an attempt on the life

1555
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:50,393
of mr. Sherlock holmes
dr. Watson and...

1556
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,586
That'll do to go
on with, lestrade.

1557
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:55,255
When the professor has
answered to those charges,

1558
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,382
there will doubtless
be a number of others

1559
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,383
to occupy his attention.

1560
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,927
Listen, holmes, there's
no prison can hold me.

1561
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,722
You know I almost wish
that were true, professor.

1562
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:07,184
Life would be very dull
without your activities.

1563
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:10,437
Watson, might I trouble
you for a match?

1564
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,898
I think our quiet
rest in the country

1565
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:16,151
has been a great success.

1566
01:09:16,234 --> 01:09:18,111
Damn you, holmes.

1567
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:19,195
Blast you.

1568
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:21,823
Well, it's the
most amazing case

1569
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,326
we've ever solved, holmes.

1570
01:09:24,409 --> 01:09:26,370
Elementary my dear, watson.

1571
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,537
Elementary.
