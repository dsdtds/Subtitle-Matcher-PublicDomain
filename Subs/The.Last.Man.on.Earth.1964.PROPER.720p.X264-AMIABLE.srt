1
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:59,851
Another day to live through,
better get started.

2
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,633
December, 1965.

3
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:34,303
Is that all it has been since
I inherited the world?

4
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,514
Only three years.

5
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,934
It seems like a hundred million.

6
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:47,853
Yeah, I own the world.
An empty, dead, silent world.

7
00:04:57,114 --> 00:05:01,825
More of them for the pit.
Every day there are more of them.

8
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:05,996
They live off the weak ones
and leave them for the pit.

9
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,499
K-O-K-W calling. Come in.

10
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:07,266
K-O-K-W calling.

11
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:12,104
I'm on international
frequency. Come in.

12
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,640
They can't bear to see their image.

13
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,809
It repels them.

14
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,270
I need more mirrors.

15
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,315
And this garlic's lost its pungency.

16
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,373
There was a time when
eating was pleasurable.

17
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:16,668
Now it bores me.
Just fuel for survival.

18
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:20,547
I'll settle for coffee and
orange juice this morning.

19
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:26,094
But first there is my life to consider.
I'd better replace that garlic.

20
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:43,362
I need more, lots more.
Better stop off and get them.

21
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:10,180
I can't afford the luxury of anger.
Anger can make me vulnerable.

22
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:15,352
It can destroy my reason, and reason
is the only advantage I have over them.

23
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:19,022
I've got to find where
they hide during the day.

24
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:21,483
Uncover every one of them.

25
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,945
Now, where did I
finish off yesterday?

26
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:28,282
Madison Street to 31st Avenue.

27
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:33,120
Eleven kills over three years.

28
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,958
And there's more than half
the city I haven't searched.

29
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:00,606
They're perfect.

30
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:05,528
Just wide enough to keep the flesh
apart so their body seal can't function.

31
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,114
How many more of these
will I have to make...

32
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,282
before they're all destroyed?

33
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,286
They want my blood,
it's their lives or mine.

34
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,830
But, I still get squeamish.

35
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:27,883
Wait... that garlic.

36
00:09:28,343 --> 00:09:30,886
I'd better put it back
where it belongs.

37
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:35,307
I can't live a heartbeat away
from hell and forget it.

38
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:24,731
I'm out of gas. That means one
more stop I'll have to make.

39
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,089
I can get rid of them later.

40
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,717
Right now, I'm out of gas.

41
00:14:12,961 --> 00:14:14,837
They're still fresh.

42
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:18,590
But I'll take only what I need.
They've got to last.

43
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:55,002
They can wait too.
I've got my life to worry about.

44
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:58,421
Those mirrors have to be
replaced before dark.

45
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:33,624
Square blocks to search.
How many of them still exist?

46
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,918
How long will I have to
keep up this search?

47
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:47,072
I haven't much time left.
It'll be dark in an hour.

48
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,792
And now 12 long hours
before the sun will rise...

49
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,295
and drive them back to darkness.

50
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:28,715
Morgan, come out.

51
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,092
Come out.

52
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,777
Morgan, come out. Come out.

53
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:34,697
Robert, help me!

54
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:49,420
Another day.

55
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,091
Another day to start all over again.

56
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:31,082
Virge.

57
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:35,169
Virge.

58
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:38,464
God, how I miss you.

59
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:13,666
The sun's already set.
They'll be everywhere!

60
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:24,695
It's Morgan. Get him!

61
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,681
Do you hear?

62
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:58,200
Morgan.

63
00:27:59,703 --> 00:28:02,246
Do you hear, Morgan?

64
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,248
Morgan.

65
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,543
Do you hear, Morgan?

66
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,173
Three years.

67
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:17,970
Three years.

68
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:38,199
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

69
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:40,535
Hey, Virge? Virge?

70
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:44,872
Yes? Oh no! My makeup. My hair!

71
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,068
Hey, where is everybody?

72
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,044
- All I can see is...
- Hi, Ben!

73
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:53,214
I can hear children,
but I can't see any children.

74
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:55,049
Uncle Ben!

75
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,135
Uncle Ben!

76
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,805
Look at Uncle Ben!

77
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:04,266
Ben! Uncle Ben! Uncle Ben!

78
00:29:08,105 --> 00:29:11,232
- What did you bring me?
- Open them and see.

79
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:14,026
- Come. Come.
- Go on and open them Kathy.

80
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,126
Take a look at this.

81
00:29:41,096 --> 00:29:44,557
- It's highly theoretical, Ben.
- Theoretical?

82
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:49,937
Do I have to remind you that theory
is the beginning of solution?

83
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,738
"Is Europe's disease carried
on the wind?" Is it, Ben?

84
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,450
- It could be.
- And if it is?

85
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,953
It isn't, Virge.

86
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:09,290
Is that what you really think,
or just what you'd like to think?

87
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:13,211
I cannot accept half-baked
theories that sell newspapers.

88
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:16,422
I'm a scientist, not an alarmist.

89
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,424
You're whistling past the graveyard.

90
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,344
Is that a commentary
on my work at the lab?

91
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:24,389
- We both know how hard you've worked.
- I'm sorry, Ben.

92
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,726
I just can't accept the
idea of universal disease.

93
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:33,022
Uncle Ben, you promised
us card tricks.

94
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:36,567
All right, Kathy.
Who can resist that face?

95
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:41,071
All right. Card tricks. Card tricks.

96
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:44,783
Robert...

97
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:48,704
Is it possible this germ,
or virus, could be airborne?

98
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:52,750
Anything is possible, Virge.

99
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:56,963
The best brains in the world have
been running through this thing...

100
00:30:56,964 --> 00:30:58,673
with a fine-toothed comb.

101
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:00,883
The germ is visible
under a microscope...

102
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:04,303
but it's not like any
bacilli I've ever known.

103
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,639
In what way?

104
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,060
It can't be destroyed by any process
we've been able to uncover.

105
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:15,773
But with the whole world trying,
there must be a solution.

106
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:19,443
Mommy, when are we
gonna cut the cake?

107
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:24,031
Right now our problem
is to cut that cake.

108
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,870
- Hey, Mommy. Mommy!
- Coming. Coming.

109
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,958
The wind wake you up?

110
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,918
It always does.

111
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,688
- How do you feel?
- I'm all right.

112
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,866
- Don't get up, honey.
- I'm not sick, Bob.

113
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:07,343
- I'll make your breakfast.
- You don't have to.

114
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,513
I'll be all right.
Go on and read your paper.

115
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:12,264
All right.

116
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:58,102
Sweetheart, look, if you don't
feel well, please go back to bed.

117
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:01,063
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

118
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:04,733
I wish somebody would find a vaccine.

119
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:08,445
It's all we're working
on at the lab, Virge.

120
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:12,616
Maybe you better not send
her to school today.

121
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,702
All right.

122
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:20,040
- Do you think you should go to work?
- I have to.

123
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,042
Bob?

124
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:25,712
Bob, I'm so frightened.

125
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:30,426
Everything's going to be
all right, sweetheart.

126
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,043
- Well?
- The bacilli are multiplying.

127
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:08,381
That kicks the bone marrow
theory in the head.

128
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:10,716
This specimen shows a
higher white count...

129
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:13,469
than when I put it on the slide.

130
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,848
Those cells are still living,
Dr. Mercer, off one another.

131
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,559
There has to be an answer.

132
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,105
You've heard that all communications are
ended outside the continental limits?

133
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:25,398
Yes, I heard.

134
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:29,693
That leaves it in our laps.
So we keep trying. Where's Cortman?

135
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,238
Well he should be here by now.

136
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,783
You two stay on this virus theory
until I decide it's exhausted.

137
00:35:35,784 --> 00:35:37,326
Right.

138
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:40,997
- Yes, sir?
- Morgan will fill you in.

139
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:42,915
All right, sir.

140
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,281
And what did the great man of science
have to say today? More of the usual?

141
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:52,133
Oh, he's trying, Ben.
Just like the rest of us.

142
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,218
And nothing works.

143
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:57,138
The streets are swarming
with truckloads of bodies...

144
00:35:57,139 --> 00:35:59,974
that they're throwing
into that God-awful pit.

145
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,892
And the dedicated
Dr. Mercer goes on...

146
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,770
with his plodding,
unimaginative approach.

147
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,732
- You have a better idea?
- Maybe.

148
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,485
- At least it involves imagination.
- Ben, it's as simple as this.

149
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:14,697
An unknown germ is being
blown around the world.

150
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:18,242
It's highly contagious,
and it's reached plague proportions.

151
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:21,787
And you don't believe some
of the dead have come back?

152
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,914
Let's get to work.

153
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:29,670
And why are they burning the bodies?
Why don't they bury them?

154
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:32,673
Because it's the best known way
to control the contagion...

155
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,717
to keep the germ from spreading.

156
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:37,386
That's what we've always
believed, at any rate.

157
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:41,598
- You'd prefer us to believe in vampires?
- If they exist, yes.

158
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:44,685
There are stories being told, Bob.

159
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:47,855
By people who are out of
their minds with fear!

160
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:52,234
Maybe, but there are too many
to be just coincidental.

161
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:57,864
Stories about people who have
died, and have come back.

162
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,034
They're stories, Ben, stories.

163
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:04,371
And why are the infected people
always so tired in the daytime?

164
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:07,124
Why can't they stand the sunlight?

165
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,918
Why are they only seen at night?

166
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:13,130
Come here.

167
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:17,510
- Look.
- I know as well as...

168
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:18,635
Look!

169
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:24,683
- Now, is this bacilli or isn't it?
- It doesn't alter...

170
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:29,105
And this bacilli is found in the blood
of every infected person, or isn't it?

171
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:32,358
To show me germs is not to
refute these stories, Bob.

172
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,903
The point is, if there are vampires,
they exist in spite of these germs.

173
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:39,656
Come on, let's get to work.

174
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,792
Until further notice this station...

175
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:53,838
will continue its around-the-clock
coverage of this national disaster.

176
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,299
And now we switch you
to the state capitol...

177
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,136
where His Excellency, the Governor

178
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:03,305
is speaking from the
executive mansion.

179
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:08,102
Further, I have in conjunction
with the Federal Government...

180
00:38:08,103 --> 00:38:11,313
declared this state to
be a disaster area.

181
00:38:11,314 --> 00:38:15,234
The public health is dependent on the
bodies of the deceased being burned.

182
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:17,820
You must notify the Health
Department immediately...

183
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:19,864
if you have a plague
victim in your home.

184
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:22,491
Under no circumstances
should you gather publicly.

185
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:25,535
In view of the dire emergency
that exists, I intend to...

186
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,793
Anything new?

187
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:35,671
No, nothing new.

188
00:38:44,514 --> 00:38:46,181
Nothing.

189
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:54,898
Mommy, where are you?

190
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:58,568
Mommy, I can't see.

191
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:00,737
Mommy...

192
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,325
- I'm going to call the doctor.
- I said no.

193
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,916
Virge, there's nothing they can do.

194
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:16,420
- But we can't just let her lie there.
- Well, this way she has a chance.

195
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:20,674
If you call a doctor, he'll report it.
Do you want that?

196
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:28,098
Mommy, help me.

197
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,100
Mommy...

198
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,811
Mommy, please help me.

199
00:39:33,146 --> 00:39:34,771
Mommy, help me.

200
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:40,152
- How can you be so sure she's...
- Blindness is one of the symptoms.

201
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:44,531
You're not to call a doctor
under any circumstances.

202
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:48,368
No one is to come into this house.
Now remember that.

203
00:39:48,703 --> 00:39:51,913
Mommy... Mommy...

204
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,208
Mommy, where are you?

205
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,465
I've got to pick Ben Cortman
up on the way to the lab.

206
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:05,135
No one is to come into this house.

207
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:07,512
Now remember that!

208
00:40:22,487 --> 00:40:26,198
No! No! No! Please!

209
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,662
Please don't let him
be buried in the pit.

210
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,584
Please, for God's sake.
Don't take him away like this.

211
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:40,420
You can't! You can't!

212
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,501
- Who's there?
- It's me, Ben. We're late.

213
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:28,593
Ben, what's the matter with you?

214
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,096
Nothing. And I'm going
to keep it that way.

215
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:35,642
- Ben! Look, let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to talk about.

216
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:40,772
You think I'm out of my mind.
You laughed at me and my theory.

217
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,983
You might be one of them.

218
00:41:42,984 --> 00:41:45,235
Ben, look, you're ill.
You ought to see a doctor.

219
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,070
No doctors.

220
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:50,407
You take care of your life.
I'll take care of mine.

221
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,701
Now get away from here.

222
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:55,662
You understand? Get away from here!

223
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:15,033
If you're looking for
anybody but me, forget it.

224
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:24,626
- Are they all gone?
- That's right.

225
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:27,921
Is there any hope from
the latest reports?

226
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:30,173
No, not yet.

227
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,760
But believe me, Morgan,
we'll find an answer.

228
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:37,263
When, Doctor?
We need it right now. I need it!

229
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:41,810
You're the only one who wasn't
afraid to come here today.

230
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:44,771
What's going to happen, Dr. Mercer?

231
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:49,776
Is everybody in the world going to die
before someone finds the answer?

232
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:52,028
No, I don't think so.

233
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,826
I don't deny that there's some strange
evolutionary process going on.

234
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,162
But mankind won't be destroyed.

235
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:04,874
The fact that you and I
are working here today...

236
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,585
is evidence of that.

237
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:28,732
All right. Let's roll.

238
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:04,768
When?

239
00:45:05,895 --> 00:45:07,187
When?

240
00:45:07,188 --> 00:45:09,356
I called a doctor. I had to.

241
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:11,900
I told you not to call anyone.

242
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:14,819
Bob, she was blind.

243
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:17,030
She couldn't see.

244
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:20,867
She kept reaching out her
hands, and groping for me.

245
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:26,498
And all of a sudden she was gone.

246
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:30,627
And they came...

247
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:33,714
and I tried to stop them.
They took her.

248
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:36,174
I saw a truck out there.

249
00:45:37,093 --> 00:45:39,761
Was that it? Was it?

250
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:41,346
Yes.

251
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,945
I'm sorry, lady.
There's nothing I can do.

252
00:45:56,946 --> 00:45:59,990
Let that truck through.
Get out of the way.

253
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,326
Get back, folks.
Nobody's allowed out there.

254
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:06,997
Please, all of you.
Get behind those lines.

255
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:10,333
Look sharp there. Move. Move along.

256
00:46:12,629 --> 00:46:16,214
Make way for that truck. This way.

257
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:21,970
Hey, you, mister! Come back!

258
00:46:33,149 --> 00:46:36,026
Did this truck just come
in from Market Street?

259
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,904
I said, did this truck just
come in from Market Street?

260
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:41,156
Mister, I don't know.

261
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,424
Hey, you don't
belong in here. Get out.

262
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:03,011
- I said get out!
- I want my daughter.

263
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:06,681
Mister, a lot of daughters are
in there, including my own.

264
00:47:44,303 --> 00:47:46,596
Bob, I can't see!

265
00:47:46,723 --> 00:47:48,598
I can't see!

266
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,352
Virge!

267
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,795
Virge.

268
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:41,651
No.

269
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:45,822
I won't let them put
you there, Virge.

270
00:48:46,908 --> 00:48:48,741
I promise.

271
00:48:50,036 --> 00:48:52,787
I won't let them put you there.

272
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:55,118
Let me in.

273
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,332
Let me in.

274
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:05,128
Let me in.

275
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:09,924
Let me in.

276
00:51:13,846 --> 00:51:16,639
Let me in.

277
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,980
Let me in.

278
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:26,357
Let me in.

279
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:38,995
Who is it?

280
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,127
Who's there?

281
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:13,154
Robert.

282
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:15,907
Robert.

283
00:52:19,453 --> 00:52:22,997
Robert.

284
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,607
Morgan.

285
00:52:49,608 --> 00:52:52,985
We're going to kill you, Morgan.

286
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:57,156
Morgan? Do you hear?

287
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,909
Morgan.

288
00:53:01,704 --> 00:53:04,455
Morgan!

289
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:08,167
Do you hear, Morgan?

290
00:53:08,502 --> 00:53:13,589
Morgan? Do you hear, Morgan?

291
00:54:08,938 --> 00:54:12,273
If Cortman thinks he can get
to me by destroying my car...

292
00:54:12,274 --> 00:54:14,734
his wits are getting dull.

293
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:22,200
This convertible would be nice.

294
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:24,535
Probably handles well.

295
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,996
But I can't think of comfort.

296
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:30,249
There was a time when
I shopped for a car...

297
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:33,044
but now I'm looking for a hearse.

298
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:36,088
This station wagon will have to do.

299
00:55:19,592 --> 00:55:21,258
Alive.

300
00:55:21,677 --> 00:55:23,552
It's alive!

301
00:55:28,684 --> 00:55:31,560
Wait. Don't run away!

302
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:33,438
Come back here.

303
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:35,731
Don't run away!

304
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:43,906
Come back. Come back here!

305
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:48,703
Wherever he is, I've got to find him.

306
00:55:48,704 --> 00:55:51,581
If I have to search every street,
every house, every alley...

307
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:54,834
every inch of this town,
I've got to find him.

308
00:55:59,757 --> 00:56:01,590
Come back!

309
00:56:05,554 --> 00:56:08,013
Hey, boy, where are you?

310
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:17,440
Where are you, pal? Come here.

311
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:53,309
They're dead.

312
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,519
They've been staked!

313
00:57:04,113 --> 00:57:08,157
But these are made of
iron, not wood like mine.

314
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:15,623
Someone else is alive in this world.

315
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:18,876
But where are they?
Where are they hiding?

316
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:28,260
How many are there?
Where did they come from?

317
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:30,846
Why haven't I seen them?

318
00:57:38,397 --> 00:57:40,731
This is Robert Morgan.

319
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,820
If somebody can hear me, answer me.

320
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:49,240
For God's sake, answer me!

321
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:54,912
This is K-O-K-W calling.

322
00:57:54,913 --> 00:57:57,122
K-O-K-W calling.

323
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,124
Answer me.

324
00:58:33,285 --> 00:58:36,662
So you finally decided to come back.

325
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:39,290
It's alright boy.

326
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,250
Good boy.

327
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:44,545
Oh, no.

328
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:50,092
Don't worry, boy.

329
00:58:50,344 --> 00:58:53,804
You're going to be all right.
Yes, you are.

330
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:10,571
There now, we've got
you all cleaned up.

331
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:13,658
You're gonna feel better.

332
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:17,578
Gonna put you down here
now and you can rest.

333
00:59:17,996 --> 00:59:20,706
Got you all cleaned up.

334
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,935
You know they're out
there, don't you?

335
00:59:40,936 --> 00:59:43,938
You poor driven thing.

336
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:52,237
Everything's going to be all right.

337
00:59:52,573 --> 00:59:55,032
Nobody's going to hurt you.

338
00:59:55,784 --> 00:59:58,619
Everything's going to be all right.

339
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:01,205
All right.

340
01:00:01,415 --> 01:00:03,958
You're going to get better.

341
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:06,919
We're going to have lots
of happy times together.

342
01:00:07,754 --> 01:00:11,090
You'll see. Everything's
going to be fine.

343
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:08,313
What's the use?

344
01:02:09,585 --> 01:02:13,462
Wait, I'm not going to hurt you.
Can't you understand? Wait!

345
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:35,943
Wait.

346
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:39,571
I'm not going to hurt you. Wait.

347
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,660
I couldn't be out here in the
daylight if I was one of them.

348
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:48,163
You know that they can't
come out until sundown.

349
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:52,584
Do you want to come with me,
or do you want to face them?

350
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:25,969
- You feeling better?
- Yes.

351
01:04:26,179 --> 01:04:30,015
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.

352
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:46,698
- You seem very well organized here.
- Yeah.

353
01:04:48,368 --> 01:04:50,827
My name is Ruth Collins.

354
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:55,499
I was married.

355
01:04:57,252 --> 01:04:59,378
I lost my husband.

356
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:03,882
You are alone?

357
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,637
- You were married?
- Yes.

358
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:11,265
Children?

359
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,393
A daughter.

360
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,166
What are you doing?

361
01:05:41,213 --> 01:05:43,964
Please, stop! Stop it, please!

362
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:45,841
You're making me sick.

363
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:49,261
Why do you turn away?
Why do you turn away?

364
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:59,604
- You are infected.
- No.

365
01:06:02,526 --> 01:06:05,736
Infected systems are
allergic to garlic.

366
01:06:06,404 --> 01:06:09,614
- You think I'm one of them.
- You will be.

367
01:06:11,785 --> 01:06:14,787
You've made up your
mind just because I...

368
01:06:14,788 --> 01:06:17,331
You can't change the
facts by talking.

369
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:20,167
Facts? What facts?

370
01:06:21,086 --> 01:06:22,837
That I got sick?

371
01:06:22,838 --> 01:06:25,381
I've had a sensitive
stomach all my life.

372
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:29,760
I saw my husband killed. Torn to
pieces, right in front of our house.

373
01:06:29,761 --> 01:06:32,179
I've been wandering ever since.

374
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:35,515
Hiding at night.
Not eating more than scraps.

375
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:40,479
Sick with mourning,
sick with fear, unable to sleep.

376
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:43,607
Then you shout at me.

377
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:46,151
You chase me across
the field, hit me...

378
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:48,779
drag me to this house,
and to top it all...

379
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,658
when I get sick because you shove
a piece of reeking garlic in my face...

380
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:55,077
you tell me I'm infected.

381
01:06:56,872 --> 01:06:58,539
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

382
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,249
You can't go out there.
It's almost sunset.

383
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,084
- Let me go, I said.
- You can't go out there now.

384
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:05,462
In a few minutes the streets
will be full of them.

385
01:07:05,463 --> 01:07:08,424
- I don't care.
- At least let me give you a blood test.

386
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:10,384
Don't touch me.

387
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:13,845
Don't touch me.

388
01:07:14,848 --> 01:07:17,057
Don't touch me.

389
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:29,778
You must be hungry.
I'll fix you some dinner.

390
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:51,967
- You know, you should eat.
- I can't.

391
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,236
- You seem used to them.
- As much as anybody could be.

392
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:15,407
I'm not frightened of them anymore,
if that's what you mean.

393
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:19,662
I protect myself against them,
but only because there are so many.

394
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,914
Individually, they're weak.

395
01:08:21,915 --> 01:08:25,459
Mentally incompetent,
like animals after a long famine.

396
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,211
If they weren't...

397
01:08:27,212 --> 01:08:31,382
they surely would've found a way
of breaking in here a long time ago.

398
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:33,592
Come out, Morgan.

399
01:08:36,388 --> 01:08:38,221
Hear that?

400
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,724
That's Ben Cortman.

401
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:43,560
- He was my friend.
- Your friend?

402
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:45,646
He was like a kid brother.

403
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:48,815
If I could find him
and destroy him...

404
01:08:49,484 --> 01:08:51,902
But you said he was your friend.

405
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:56,406
When I find him I'll drive a stake
through him, just like all the others.

406
01:09:01,955 --> 01:09:06,291
But you lived through all this.
Do you know why?

407
01:09:07,335 --> 01:09:09,628
Perhaps I was chosen.

408
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:13,215
That's a laugh.

409
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:18,262
Or perhaps it's because a long time
ago when I worked in Panama...

410
01:09:18,263 --> 01:09:21,014
I was bitten in my sleep by a bat.

411
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,475
My theory is that the...

412
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:26,937
the bat had previously
acquired the vampire germ.

413
01:09:26,938 --> 01:09:28,731
By the time it entered my blood...

414
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,483
it had been strained and
weakened by the bat's system.

415
01:09:31,484 --> 01:09:35,320
As a result, I have immunity.

416
01:09:36,322 --> 01:09:39,908
It's only a guess,
but it's all I have to go on.

417
01:09:42,996 --> 01:09:47,832
You don't think that
I'm immune, do you?

418
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:51,378
It's a simple matter to find
out whether you are or not.

419
01:09:57,343 --> 01:10:01,930
What will you do if I am infected?

420
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:04,099
Cure me?

421
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:08,395
You don't have to answer.

422
01:10:08,396 --> 01:10:10,897
I know as well as you do...

423
01:10:11,983 --> 01:10:13,650
it's incurable.

424
01:10:13,651 --> 01:10:15,652
There might be a way.

425
01:10:15,653 --> 01:10:20,740
If not of killing the germ, at least of
containing it, keeping it from spreading.

426
01:10:21,242 --> 01:10:24,578
If I had the equipment, the time.

427
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:27,497
Which you don't.

428
01:11:09,249 --> 01:11:11,208
You are one of them.

429
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:15,378
I was. And without that
injection, I'll be one again.

430
01:11:15,797 --> 01:11:17,714
What do you mean?

431
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:20,884
- You found a solution?
- That's right.

432
01:11:21,261 --> 01:11:23,720
Exactly as you said it could be.

433
01:11:24,389 --> 01:11:26,598
I take that for it.

434
01:11:28,768 --> 01:11:30,310
What is it?

435
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:33,605
Defibrinated blood, plus vaccine.

436
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,525
The blood feeds the germ...

437
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:39,111
the vaccine keeps it isolated...

438
01:11:39,112 --> 01:11:41,988
and prevents it from multiplying.

439
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:46,618
We've had it for some time now.

440
01:11:46,828 --> 01:11:48,328
We?

441
01:11:48,746 --> 01:11:49,663
We?

442
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:52,457
There are quite a number of us.

443
01:11:53,376 --> 01:11:56,086
And I thought you were alone.

444
01:11:56,296 --> 01:11:58,755
I was going to cure you.

445
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:01,633
- Does that amuse you?
- No.

446
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:06,471
Now, I want the truth.

447
01:12:07,849 --> 01:12:10,475
I want all of it. Why are you here?

448
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:13,187
To find out if you know
any more than we do.

449
01:12:13,188 --> 01:12:14,980
You know far less.

450
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:18,775
We're alive. Infected, yes.
But alive.

451
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,861
We're going to reorganize society.

452
01:12:22,197 --> 01:12:26,867
Do away with all those wretched creatures
who are neither alive nor dead.

453
01:12:26,868 --> 01:12:29,744
Start everything all over again.

454
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:33,123
And you want me to join?

455
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,792
You can't join us.

456
01:12:35,793 --> 01:12:38,128
You're a monster to them.

457
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:40,839
Why do you think I
ran when I saw you?

458
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,467
Even though I was
assigned to spy on you.

459
01:12:43,468 --> 01:12:47,012
Because I was so terrified
of what I'd heard about you.

460
01:12:47,013 --> 01:12:51,182
You're a legend in the city.
Living by day instead of night.

461
01:12:51,476 --> 01:12:55,229
Leaving, as evidence of your
existence, bloodless corpses.

462
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:58,815
Many of the people you
destroyed were still alive.

463
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:03,236
Many of them were loved ones
of the people in my group.

464
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:06,165
I didn't know.

465
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,771
Is there any way you
can get out of here?

466
01:13:07,772 --> 01:13:09,807
What do you mean?

467
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:12,847
They're coming after you tonight.

468
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:18,168
That's why I was sent here.
To prevent you from resisting them.

469
01:13:18,169 --> 01:13:24,090
I'm supposed to keep
you here until they come.

470
01:13:24,884 --> 01:13:27,969
- To kill me?
- Yes.

471
01:13:28,179 --> 01:13:31,055
Your new society sounds charming.

472
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:35,477
The beginning of any society
is never charming or gentle.

473
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:39,397
And you pretended to be
shocked at my violence.

474
01:13:39,941 --> 01:13:42,359
Well, what are you waiting for?

475
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,904
Why don't you go on and use it?
Get it over with. Use it!

476
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:47,864
Get it over with!

477
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:00,293
Now you know.

478
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:06,174
What are you going to do?

479
01:15:47,026 --> 01:15:51,195
- What are you doing?
- It's already done.

480
01:15:51,531 --> 01:15:53,031
What?

481
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,915
Look.

482
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,917
Look!

483
01:16:17,557 --> 01:16:20,975
You see? It worked, Ruth.

484
01:16:21,602 --> 01:16:24,687
The antibodies in my blood worked.

485
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:27,566
My blood has saved you, Ruth.

486
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:32,487
Do you know what this means?
You and I can save all the others.

487
01:16:32,697 --> 01:16:36,407
We won't be alone.
We'll never be alone again.

488
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:39,369
You are sure?

489
01:16:39,954 --> 01:16:41,788
Wait.

490
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:01,140
Don't be afraid.

491
01:17:27,535 --> 01:17:29,212
- Where are you going?
- I have to get out of here...

492
01:17:29,213 --> 01:17:31,156
- and tell them you're not a threat to us.
- You can't go out there.

493
01:17:31,157 --> 01:17:34,063
You can save all of us. When they
come here there won't be time...

494
01:17:34,064 --> 01:17:37,060
for questions and answers.
They'll come to kill.

495
01:17:37,061 --> 01:17:40,805
For God's sake, Robert, let me go.
Oh Robert, please.

496
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:43,349
Ruth, look. Tomorrow.

497
01:17:43,809 --> 01:17:46,936
Please. Robert.

498
01:17:46,938 --> 01:17:50,606
Tomorrow, Ruth.
Tomorrow will be all right.

499
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:53,860
Robert, no.

500
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,967
- Robert.
- Yes, Ruth?

501
01:18:16,968 --> 01:18:20,553
- What if this doesn't last?
- But it will.

502
01:18:21,055 --> 01:18:24,099
I've already checked it
under the microscope.

503
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,309
Wait, I'll show you.

504
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:29,228
I'll prove it to you.
I'll check it again.

505
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:54,420
Ruth, just take a look at this.

506
01:18:55,673 --> 01:18:57,591
This'll prove it to you.

507
01:18:57,592 --> 01:19:00,635
Ruth, there's no change.
I've double... checked.

508
01:19:01,721 --> 01:19:03,513
- Robert!
- Ruth.

509
01:19:04,432 --> 01:19:06,432
- Ruth!
- Robert!

510
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:07,851
Ruth!

511
01:19:07,852 --> 01:19:10,103
Get away from her.

512
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,440
Ruth, are you all right?

513
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:15,483
Are you all right?

514
01:19:26,245 --> 01:19:28,663
Run, Robert! Robert, run!

515
01:19:31,709 --> 01:19:34,836
Run! They've come
to kill you, Robert.

516
01:19:48,476 --> 01:19:50,518
Run! Run!

517
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:13,833
Up there!

518
01:20:30,685 --> 01:20:32,810
There he is.

519
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:37,440
Wait, you don't understand. Wait!

520
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:41,903
Get him! Get him!

521
01:20:52,164 --> 01:20:53,706
Wait!

522
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:02,506
Surround the block. Move! Move!

523
01:21:13,978 --> 01:21:16,020
This way. Hey, over here.

524
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:18,481
This way. Cover all sides!

525
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:18,541
Stand back.

526
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:09,717
There he is! In the church!

527
01:23:15,975 --> 01:23:17,475
Over there!

528
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,446
Hold your fire!

529
01:25:05,542 --> 01:25:07,418
Freaks!

530
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:09,379
All of you.

531
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,923
All of you, freaks. Mutations.

532
01:25:21,642 --> 01:25:23,142
Hold it.

533
01:25:23,143 --> 01:25:25,019
You're freaks.

534
01:25:25,437 --> 01:25:27,271
I am a man.

535
01:25:27,815 --> 01:25:30,858
The last man.

536
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:35,654
Robert!

537
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:40,743
They were afraid of me.

538
01:25:41,036 --> 01:25:43,704
They were afraid of me.

539
01:25:44,498 --> 01:25:46,666
They were afraid of me.

540
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:49,126
They didn't know.

541
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:31,210
Don't cry.
There's nothing to cry about.

542
01:26:31,253 --> 01:26:33,754
We're all safe now.

543
01:26:34,465 --> 01:26:36,215
All safe.
