00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,550
Doc Holliday just got off
the stagecoach.

2
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,560
Do you want me and some of
the boys to come along with ya?

3
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,060
Why do you ask that?

4
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,570
Well, I certainly wouldn't want
to fool around with him alone.

5
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,570
I don't blame ya,

6
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,070
But I’m not gonna make
any trouble for Doc Holliday.

7
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,070
He's my best friend.

8
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,570
As long as I’m sheriff
around here, the place is his.

[♪ <i>Camptown Races</i> on piano]

10
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Mike, where's Doc Holliday?

11
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,580
In here, Pat.

12
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,590
Hi, Pat.
Hi.

13
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,590
Gosh, I’m glad to see you.

14
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,590
Doc, how are you?

15
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,600
You're lookin' plenty sassy.

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Well, you wintered
kinda fat, didn't you?

17
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,600
What are you doing
over this way?

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,100
Well, for one thing, I want
to have a little talk with you,

19
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,600
And the other is this--

20
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,610
Have you seen anything of
a little strawberry roan?

21
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,110
Somebody steal your horse?

22
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,610
Yeah. Cutest little fella
you ever saw.

23
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,110
Mean as mean, but I dote on him
like he was pure rock candy.

[Chuckles]

25
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,620
What are you laughing at?

26
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,620
Joke's on whoever done it.

27
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,630
First time I ever felt sorry
for a horse thief.

28
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,630
Did you hear
he was headed this way?

29
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,130
Yeah. Oh, uh, put that
on the table in there.

30
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,630
What are you gonna have, Pat?

31
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,140
Well, I started with rye.
I don't see no cause to change.

32
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,640
Where you been
keeping yourself?

33
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Well, mostly across the border.

34
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
That's what
I want to see you about.

35
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
I, uh, I need a little money,

36
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,650
And I thought maybe you might
want to come in with me.

37
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,650
[Laughs]

38
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,150
Well, what's the matter?

39
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,650
I'll let you have the money,

40
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,650
But if the deal is anything like
that last one of yours,

41
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,650
You'd better not
tell me about it.

42
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,160
Why not?

43
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,170
Where'd you get that thing?

44
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,170
Oh, they stuck it on me
a couple of weeks ago.

45
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,170
You're the last man
I ever thought

46
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,670
Would be so easily satisfied.

47
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,180
Well, a man's gotta
settle down sometime.

48
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,180
Say, mike, did you see anything
of a strange strawberry roan?

49
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,190
Strawberry roan?

50
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,690
Yeah, about 13 hands high
and cute as a bug's ear.

51
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,690
Seems to me I did see
one about that size.

52
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,700
Yeah, when I came on duty.

53
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,200
Where?

54
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,700
Up in front of
the dentist's place.

55
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Yeah? Where's that?
I'll show you.

56
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,210
Man: I’m only gonna
tell you once more.

57
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,720
You put that glass
on top of your head.

58
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
But what are you
gonna do then?

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,220
Just put it up on your head.
I'll show you.

60
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,730
Best thing in the world
for that dandruff of yours.

61
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,730
Wait a minute, Doc.

62
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,730
Hello, Fred.

63
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,740
Hello, Pat.

64
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
You're--You're still
using that one, huh?

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
My old standby.

66
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,740
Never has failed yet.

67
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,750
How many fingers
do you see, Fred?

68
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,750
Well, I guess I better
take Fred over to the jail,

69
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,260
Let him sober up there.
You go ahead, Doc.

70
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,760
The dentist's place is just
up the street near the corner.

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I'll be along in a minute.

[Whinnying]

How--How are you feeling, huh?

74
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,300
Hello.

75
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,800
Nice little horse
you got here, sonny.

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I think so.

77
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,300
Where'd you get him?

78
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,800
Bought him
in Santa Fe Springs. Why?

79
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,810
Somebody stole him
from me in Socorro.

80
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,310
If it wasn't for those two guns,

81
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,310
I'd say you were
starting in pretty young.

82
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,820
You think it was me?

83
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,820
You haven't
told me any different.

84
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,320
I ain't going to.

85

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,830
Yeah.
I've heard of you.

88
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,830
Thanks.

89
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,330
I don't wanna
take advantage of you.

90
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,840
Thanks. For a while I thought
it'd be the other way around.

91
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,340
What's your name, son?

92
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,340
Bonnie. William Bonnie.

Billy the kid, huh?

94
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,350
Still think I stole your horse?

95
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,350
Doc: How much'd
you pay for him?

96
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,850
Wouldn't do any good
if I told you.

97
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,350
Why not?

98
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,350
I like this little horse,
and I’ve got kinda used to him.

99
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,860
So have I.
I don't blame you.

100
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Just like sitting
in a rocking chair.

Now, look, son--
I hear you're pretty good, Doc.

That's what I hear about you.

103
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
All right.
You mind standing away

104
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,370
From in front of that horse?

105
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,370
Pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?

106
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,870
No sense in going to
all this trouble for nothing.

107
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,370
That's right.

109
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,380
Any luck?

Yes and no.

111
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,380
What do you mean?
It's your horse, ain't it?

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,380
It was.

113

Garrett: Say, you're a cool one.

114

Better get you over
to the hoosegow

Come along.

Ah, thanks, Doc,
for being so forbearing and all.

118
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,890
All right, Pat.

119
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,900
Garrett: See why I left off?
He's just a kid.

120
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,400
I told you to come along.
Didn't you hear what I said?

121
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Yeah, I heard you.

122
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,900
You're not doing
any better than I did.

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,910
Wait a minute, Pat.

124
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,410
I'd like to make you acquainted
with this young man.

125

Uh, Billy, this is an old friend
of mine, Pat Garrett.

Well, well.

I've been wanting
to meet you for a long time.

How are you, Billy?

fingers do you see?

You ought to use that
only on your friends.

134
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,940
While you two are talking,
I better put my horse away.

135
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,440
Back up, boy.

136
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Why, you--
Hold it, Pat.

137
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,440
Don't fly off the handle.

138
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,450
Nice little horse,
ain't he, Doc?

139
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,950
[Chuckles]

140
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,630
Remember me?

141
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,140
Where's Mr. Garrett?

142
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,640
I sent him home.

143
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,640
How about you and me
having a little talk?

144
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,140
I don't believe in talk.

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,140
Unless the other fella
holds all the cards.

146
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,650
Sonny, that head of yours
sure is screwed on tight.

147
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,650
If it wasn't, somebody would
have knocked it off long ago.

148
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
I guess that's right.

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,660
Say, how did you know
Pat was gonna hit you out there?

150
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,160
Well, it's the first time

151
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
A sheriff ever wanted
to shake hands with me.

152
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,670
He heard you say, "shake hands."

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,170
Huh?

154
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,170
Oh!

155
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,180
How do you do, Mr. Horse?

156
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm pleased to meet ya.

157
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,190
Well, I’ll swear, I didn't know
he could do tricks.

158
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,690
What else can he do, Doc?

159
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,190
You back up there,
and I’ll make him walk over

160
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,190
And take those gloves
right out of your belt.

161
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,700
Over that way a little.

162
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Now, back a little farther.

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
That's far enough, kid.

164
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,710
Put your hands up.

165
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,210
All right, Doc.

166
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,220
This is something
new for you, ain't it?

167
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
What?

168
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,220
Bein' arrested
for horse stealin'.

169
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Doc, you know
I didn't steal that horse

170
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,220
Any more than you did.

171
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,230
Billy, many a true word
is spoken in jest. Hm?

172
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,240
This is something new for you
too, isn't it, Doc?

173
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,740
Yeah? What's that?

174
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,740
The great Doc Holliday getting
someone else to help him.

175
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,750
And a policeman at that.

176
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,750
I can hardly believe it.

177
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,260
And after the way I’ve heard
people talk about you,

178
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,760
Ever since I was in short pants.

179
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
That's enough of that.
Turn around.

180
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
Now, walk out that door.

181
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,770
Oh, wait a minute, Pat.
Why?

182
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,770
Well, this thing don't seem to
sit right on my stomach no how.

183
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,770
What?

184
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,780
Doc, you're not gonna
back out on me?

185
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,780
I'm afraid I am, Pat.
I'd never hear the end of this.

186
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,790
Hold on.
I'm not through with you yet.

187
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,790
Step aside, Doc.
He may shoot me in the back.

188
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,290
They tell me that's the way

189
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,300
You've given it
to some of the boys.

190
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Now, Pat, that's
a pretty strong thing to say.

191
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I never heard
anything like that.

192
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,310
Well, Mr. Garrett,
if you believe that,

193
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,810
Here's your chance
to do the same to me.

194
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,320
Comin', Doc?

195
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,830
Yeah, think I will.

196
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,370
I want the two of you
out of this town by sundown.

197
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,370
Well, what did I do?

198
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,380
That's all right, Doc.

199
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,880
You've got the right
to choose your friends.

200
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,390
Shucks. I don't take
kindly to that at all.

201
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,890
He knows there's no stage
until tomorrow,

202
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,890
And he knows that I’m afoot.

203
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,390
Or am I?

204
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,900
Not by a darn sight.

205
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
You mean that, son?

206
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,900
Sure. We'll dig you up
another horse somewhere.

207
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,460
Well, I guess
that's enough for me.

208
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,460
Cleaned out?

209
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Not quite.

210
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,970
Uh, where you stopping, son?

211
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,970
I got a room at the hotel.

212
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,470
Doc, could I see you a minute?

213
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,970
Why, sure.
You might as well cash me in.

214
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,470
All right.

215
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,980
What's on your mind, son?

216
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,980
No offense, Doc,
but that last ace you just drew.

217
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,990
Yeah? What about it?

218
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,490
I got a feeling I saw it
on the bottom of the deck.

219
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,990
Are you sure?

220
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,490
I wouldn't have asked
you if I was.

221
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,000
That's where
you showed good sense.

222
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,500
Here you are, Doc.

223
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Oh, thanks.
$640.

224
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
Thanks.
Huh.

225
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
You know, you could have
paid three or four times

226
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,510
For the horse
and still saved money.

227
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,010
That's right.
Hope you're satisfied now.

228
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,510
You gonna turn in?
Yeah, I think I will.

229
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,010
Oh, I’ll walk down
to the hotel with you.

230
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,010
Good night, gents, and thanks.

231
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,020
Man: Good night.
2nd man: Good night.

232
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,530
Doc, if you're not
already fixed up,

233
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
You can bunk with me tonight.

234
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,030
No, thanks, Billy.
I've got a girl.

235
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,030
She and her aunt
just moved in town.

236
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,030
Yeah?

237
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,540
You got a girl, Billy?

238
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,540
No, I ain't got nothin'.

239
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,040
Except that horse.

240
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,540
You can't fool me.

241
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,050
Good-looking boy like you,
you must have a girl somewhere.

242
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,550
No, I don't trust 'em.

243
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,050
Hey, you're pretty young
to talk like that.

244
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,550
Well, I’ve known quite a few.

245
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,060
And they all did you dirt, eh?
Every one of them.

246
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,060
Yeah. Every one of 'em.

247
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,060
That's too bad, Billy.

248
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,070
I guess things haven't been
so easy for you, have they?

249
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,070
Tell you what I’m going to do.

250
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,070
Since that little horse
means so much to you,

251
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,070
I'm going to make you
a present of him.

252
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,080
That's awful nice of you, Doc.
Thanks a lot.

253
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,580
All right, Billy. Good night.
See you in the morning.

254
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,080
Good night, Doc.

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
Hi, Billy.

256
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,000
Just thought I’d say
good night to little horse.

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Well, if you're
all through,

258
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,500
You might as well
put him back in his stall.

259
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,510
All right.

260
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,510
Good night, Red.
See you tomorrow.

261
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,010
What, no kiss?

262
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,510
No, he don't like mush.

263
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,520
All right,
back in your stall, Red.

264
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,020
Hey, that's my tobacco,
isn't it?

265
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
I think it is.

266
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,030
You don't mind if I take that,
do you?

267
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Red, I think I’ll bunk
right here tonight,

268
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
If you don't object.

269
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,580
[Gunshot]

270
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,610
[Gunshot]

271
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,710
Say, what is this, anyway?

272
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,710
What are you
shooting at me for?

273
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,710
Hey, are you crazy?

274
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,230
Stop it. Cut it out,
do you hear?

275
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,730
Can you understand English?
Can you?

276
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,230
Yes.

277
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,230
What's your name?

278
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,740
Rio.

279
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,240
What's the rest of it? 
McDonald.

280
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
McDonald.

281
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,750
Where'd you come from?

282
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,750
What do you care?

283
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,250
Where'd you live
before you came here?

284
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,260
Socorro.

285
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
McDonald.

286
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Oh, yeah.

287
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Who was he?

288
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,770
My brother.

289
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,270
Oh.

290
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,270
Well, he shouldn't have
taken so much tequila.

291
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,280
What became of the girl?

292
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,780
She married another fella
two weeks afterwards.

293
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,780
Well, that's the way it is.

294
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,780
How'd I know
he was your brother?

295
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,790
It was him or me.

296
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,790
And I didn't lay for him
in no barn, neither.

297
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
I'm sorry
I was so rough with you.

298
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,800
You didn't hurt me.

299
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,300
Sure?

300
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,310
It's too bad I didn't know.

301
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,810
What?

302
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,310
He was your brother.

303
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,810
What's that got to do with it?

304
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,810
Well, maybe
I wouldn't have tried so hard

305
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,310
To get the other girl.

306
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,820
[Scoffs] Oh, you wouldn't?

307
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,820
What's the matter?

308
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,320
There's a rock under here.

309
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,330
Here, let me fix it.

310
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,840
Rio: Let me go!

311
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,350
Billy: Hold still, lady, or you
won't have much dress left.

312
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,850
[Tearing]

313
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,350
Rio: Let me go!

314
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,370
He did not.
I say he did.

315
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,370
He didn't.
You really hear him holler?

316
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,870
Sure, I did.
So did I.

317
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,370
Then that ain't Billy the kid.

318
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,880
Well, shucks, a dentist
can make anybody holler.

319
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,380
Look out, here he comes.

320
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,880
Sorry to keep you waitin', Doc.

321
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I'm in no hurry.

322
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Say, mister,
you're Billy the kid, ain't ya?

323
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
That's what they tell me.

324
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
See? What'd I tell ya?

325
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,890
[All talk at once]

326
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,890
Hey, wait a minute.
One at a time.

327
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,890
Have you really got
20 notches in your gun?

328
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,890
Is it true you got 15 Indian
scalps in your war bag?

329
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,890
I had to throw them away.
Boy: Why?

330
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,900
The moths got to them.

331
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
Oh, you should have tanned 'em.
That's the best way to keep 'em.

332
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
Is that a fact?
That's what my pa told me.

333
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,900
What are you doing with
that piece of willow, son?

334
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Trying to make a whistle,
but I can't get the bark off.

335
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,910
Have you soaked it?

336
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,410
I sucked it till I’m near dry.

337
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,910
Can't you shoot the insides out?

338
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,910
Yeah, can't you?
Come on!

339
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,910
Yeah!

340
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,410
Put it up on that post.

341
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,910
Can I hold it?

342
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,420
Can you hold it steady?
Sure!

343
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,420
Billy, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

344
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,420
It's all right, Doc.

345
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,930
Turn the end up a little.

346
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,930
Little more. Little more.

347
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,930
He hit it!

348
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,430
[All shouting]

349
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Don't you ever have
to bother to take aim?

350
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Sure, I took aim.

351
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,440
When?
Before I drew.

352
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,440
Look, Billy, it's all right.
You fixed it fine.

353
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,950
Thanks.
Glad to help.

354
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,450
If there's anything I can do for
you, Billy, just let me know.

355
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,450
All right, I sure will.
    Bye, Billy.

356
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,450
Well, that's a new one on me.
What's that?

357
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,950
Aiming before you draw.

358
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,450
I've got to.
Why?

359
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,960
My hands seem to be
a little quicker than my eye.

360
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,460
Well, ain't that too bad?

361
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,960
Where'd you get the horse?

362
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
I bought this one.
[Chuckles] Looks all right.

363
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,970
He'll do for the time being.

364
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,970
Ham and eggs.
Fry the eggs on both sides.

365
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,980
I'll take the same,
mine straight up.

366
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,980
How about a cold hand
while we're waiting?

367
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,480
How much?

368
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,490
How's that?

369
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,490
Suits me.

370
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,990
Before you get started, I’d like
to speak to you for a minute.

371
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,000
Who is he?
I don't know.

372
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,510
What do you want?

373
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,510
Let's go in the back room.

374
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,010
Why?

375
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,010
You don't know me,
but we have a mutual friend.

376
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,010
Yeah, who?

377
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,520
And I don't like him
any better than you do.

378
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,020
Oh, Garrett, eh?

379
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,020
The name sounds familiar.

380
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,040
Figure on staying
in town tonight?

381
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,540
Why?

382
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Well, everybody knows
that Garrett told you

383
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,040
To get out of town.

384
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,550
Sooner or later, you're gonna
have a little trouble with him.

385
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,550
I thought
I might give you a hand.

386
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,550
That's very kind of you, mister.

387
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,550
[Chuckles] Listen,
I ain't doin' you no favor.

388
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
It'll be a pleasure.

389
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Well, what I figure is,
when he's arguing with you,

390
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
He won't be watching
anyone else.

391
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,070
So it'll be a cinch for me.

392
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,070
Be careful you don't knock me
over with the same bullet.

393
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,570
Don't worry,
I’ll stand at an angle.

394
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,580
I'll do it like this.

395
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,080
Now, um...

396
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,080
Suppose this chair
is Garrett there.

397
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
And if you're standing
about where you are,

398
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,090
Why, I’ll be over here.

399
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,590
Do you mind if I draw my gun
so you can see the line of fire?

400
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,090
No, go right ahead.

401
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,610
[Knocking at door]

402
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,610
Doc: It's me, Billy.

403
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,110
Come on in, Doc.

404
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,620
Well, what happened?

405
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
He's a pretty smart hombre.

406
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,620
Do you know him?

407
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,130
Yes, he's been hangin' around,

408
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,130
Trying to talk Garrett into
giving him a job as a deputy.

409
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,630
Yeah, well, I guess
he figured if he got Billy,

410
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,130
He'd be such a hero
he could have the deputy job.

411
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,140
Or run for governor
if he wanted it.

412
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,640
You better
get out of here, son.

413
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
Why? He pulled on me first.

414
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
Gonna be hard
to make Garrett believe that.

415
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,150
Well, we'll see.

416
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,170
Where's my dough?

417
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,680
Well, I guess
I must have picked it up.

418
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,180
You're foolish
to stick around, son.

419
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,190
I think I’d be a whole lot
more foolish to pull out.

420
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,190
Then Garrett'd be sure
that was my fault.

421
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,190
Come on, cut the deal.

422
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,190
What you mean is
you wanna play poker, huh?

423
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,700
That's right.

424
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Doc, you're not
worried about me

425
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,210
If I tangle with Garrett,
are ya?

426
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,210
Pat's pretty good.

427
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,210
I know him better than you do.

428
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,720
All right, if he's so good...

429
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Then you'll get
your horse back, won't ya?

430
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Say, I never thought of that.

431
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,240
[Sighs] Hmm.

432
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,740
What's the matter? Huh?

433
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,250
Nothin'.

434
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,750
Lend me a hundred, Doc.

435
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,760
Sorry, son, I never
lend money in a poker game.

436
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Spoils my luck.

437
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,260
But I’d be glad to have you

438
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Put up the little horse
for a hundred.

439
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,770
I guess you would.

440
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Hello, Pat.

441
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,680
Care for a bite to eat, boys?

442
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,180
Or a little hand of poker?

443
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
No, thanks, Doc.

444
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,190
Were you in there
when it happened?

445
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,190
No. But listen, Pat,
he pulled on Billy first.

446
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,700
How do you know?

447
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
His gun was on the floor.

448
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,700
That don't prove nothin'.

449
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,210
Pat, you've got an ugly temper,

450
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,210
And you're letting it
get the best of you.

451
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,710
You have no right
to hold Billy for this killing

452
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,210
And you know it.

453
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,210
You're just sore at him,
that's all.

454
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,220
Doc, I’m gonna give you
a chance to stay out of this.

455
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
Thanks.

456
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,720
Your horse is outside.
Go on, get on him.

457
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,730
Good luck to you, Doc.

458
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,230
Same to you, Pat.

459
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,230
Well, what are you waitin' for?

460
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,740
He's waiting for those chickens
of yours to hatch.

461
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,740
Are you gonna put up a fight?

462
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,750
I'll tell you one thing,
Garrett,

463
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,750
I ain't goin' to jail for
no killin' I was pushed into.

464
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,270
               What are you tryin' to do?

465
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,280
I still think that fella
pulled first on Billy.

466
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Are you throwin' off
on me again?

467
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,290
Doc: No.
Then what do you call it?

468
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,790
Well, uh, since I figure

469
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,290
That this is purely a personal
matter between you and Billy,

470
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,290
Uh, I don't think
you ought to bring in

471
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,800
All this, uh, hired help.

472
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Well, I only did that to keep
Billy from putting up a fight.

473
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,300
So I wouldn't have to kill him.

474
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,310
Do you, uh,
stuff birds too?

475
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,310
You're makin'
a big mistake, Doc,

476
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,310
Turning on an old friend.

477
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,820
And all because of a little snip

478
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,320
Who's never given
anybody nothin'

479
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Except the back of his hand.

480
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Speaking of hands--

481
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,330
Come on, let's get out of here

482
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,330
Before this hothead
makes us plug him.

483
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,330
He ain't gonna
run me out of town.

484
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,840
Well, all right,
if you want to hold the fort

485
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,340
While I ride off
on your little horse,

486
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,840
It's all right with me.

487
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,350
Well, since you put it that way.

488
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Go ahead, son.

489
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,380
Take it easy, Pat.

490
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,880
Doc, this finishes you and me
for good and all.

491
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,390
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,890
Can you get up, son?

493
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,400
I don't know.

494
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,400
Doc: Can you make it
to the horse?

495
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Billy: I think so.

496
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,460
You see what
that little horse did?

497
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,970
Pulling me out like that?

498
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,970
He's a regular bird dog.

499
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,970
Say, I gotta get you
under cover someplace.

500
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,970
I'm all right.

501
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,480
Charley, you better stay here
and have a look around town.

502
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,980
That kid's got a bullet in him,
he ain't goin' very far.

503
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,480
Let's go.

Who's that?

506
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,010
Quit that yelling.

507
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,020
Doc.

508
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Get these horses out of sight.

509
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,550
This is Billy the kid.

510
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,050
He got a bad one
on the left side,

511
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,550
But the bullet didn't hit
anything vital

512
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,050
And came out in the back.

513
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,550
Don't move him at all,
no matter what you have to do,

514
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,560
Or the bleeding
will start again.

515
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
And I guess you better
cut his clothes off.

516
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,560
Put a bandage on the wound
and see that it's always moist.

517
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,060
Keep him warm and dry,
no matter how much he sweats.

518
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,070
If he gets a chill,
he's a goner.

519
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,070
If he goes out of his head,
tie him down.

520
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,070
If the neighbors
hear him yelling,

521
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,070
Well, tell 'em
your aunt's got the smallpox,

522
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,580
That'll keep 'em away.

523
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,580
Guess that's all.

524
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,590
Now, do your best for this boy.

525
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,590
If I can't come back,
I’ll send word where I am,

526
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,600
And Billy can bring you along.

He's so hot.

He's no hotter than
your brother Julio was.

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
He's soaking wet again.

533
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,420
Get me some sheets,
aunt Guadalupe.

534
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,920
Get them yourself.

535
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
What's the matter with you?

536
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,430
I wouldn't
lift a finger for him.

What's the matter?

They're looking for him
around here.

Well, ain't that too bad?

Chico, what's
the matter with you?

He smells the blood.

He was just getting ready
to peck his eyes out.

Yes, that's my name. Why?

Yes.

Well, my name's Woodruff.
Charley Woodruff.

he was town marshal at Socorro.

No.

00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,890
Is he all right again?

644
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,400
Say, who's this ol' lollipop?

645
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
That's my aunt Guadalupe.

646
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,400
<I>tía Lupe, cómo está?</I>

647
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,900
You haven't got a ham sandwich
on you by any chance, have you?

648
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,400
You hungry?

649
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,910
I don't think we have anything
cooked except some beans.

650
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,410
That'll do for a starter,
eh, lollipop?

651
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,910
Say, you don't talk
like a sick man.

652
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,410
Who said I was?

653
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,420
What does that lollipop mean?

654
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,430
Oh, something sweet.
Sweet?

655
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:48,430
Mm-hm, sweet. Like
candy, you know, <i>dolce.</I>

656
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,440
Oh. Is that a fact?

657
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,950
Where are you going?

658
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:06,450
Oh, to see if I can find
a fresh egg or two.

659
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,960
How do you feel?

660
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,470
Fine. When do we eat?

661
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,970
You just had lunch
about an hour ago.

662
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,470
Honest?

663
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,470
[Sighs]
Will you bring me my clothes?

664
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,980
I wanna get up
and have a look around.

665
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,480
What for?

666
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,980
Well, I can't spend
the rest of my life in bed.

667
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,490
Anyway, I want to see
if I can find my ring.

668
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,990
Your ring?

669
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,490
Yeah, I had a ring
on this finger and it's gone.

670
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,000
I've been sort of
worried about it.

671
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,510
Oh, well, you mustn't be upset
about a thing like that.

672
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:06,510
You can always
get another one, can't you?

673
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,010
Well, this one's been
kinda lucky for me.

674
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,510
Belonged to a fellow
who's supposed

675
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,020
To have had a charmed life,

676
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,520
As long as he kept it
on his finger.

677
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,020
Well, then, how did you get it?

678
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,520
Did you kill him?

679
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,530
No. Somebody else did that.

680
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,030
Oh. Well, then the ring wasn't

681
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,530
So lucky for him
after all, was it?

682
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,530
Well, nothing happened to him

683
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,540
Until he took it off
to wash his hands.

684
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,040
No, no, you'd better not
get up till tomorrow.

685
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,040
You said that yesterday.

686
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,040
But you're not
strong enough yet.

687
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,550
Who says I’m not?

688
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,550
Billy, you mustn't.
You'll hurt yourself.

689
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,560
Then why don't you quit
wrestling with me?

690
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,070
But you've been so sick.
You're not well enough.

691
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,570
You're...not...

692
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,090
Rio.

693
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,590
Come on. I want you
to go down to the store with me.

694
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,600
I have some washing to do.

695
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,600
Guadalupe: You've got all
afternoon to do it. Come on.

696
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,610
I have to fix my hair first.

697
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,610
All right, hurry up, then.

698
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,610
Why do you have to go with her?

699
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,620
I'd better.

700
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,620
What if somebody
should come by?

701
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,120
Like that deputy sheriff friend
of yours the other day.

702
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,120
Oh, yes, that's right.

703
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,130
I'll go tell aunt Guadalupe.

704
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,120
[Loud knocking at door]

705
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,120
[Knocking persists]

706
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,630
Who is it?
Doc: It's me, Doc.

707
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,630
Come on, hurry up.
Open this door here.

708
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,130
[Banging] Coming. 
Coming.

709
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:03,640
Hello, Doc.
Glad to see you, Doc!

710
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,140
Yeah, well, you'd never know it.

711
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,640
I thought I’d have
to break the door down.

712
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,150
It's the rain, Doc! I--I
couldn't hear a thing, Doc!

713
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,150
You don't need to yell so loud.
I'm not deaf.

714
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,150
Did you ever see such a storm?

715
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:21,660
And it's been going on like this
for three or four days, Doc!

716
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,660
Well, it's lucky for me.

717
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,160
The only way I could shake
those bloodhounds.

718
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,660
Washed out all your tracks, huh?

719
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:38,170
Hungry?

720
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,670
First sit-down
I’ve had since I left here.

721
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,180
[Chuckles]
How's Billy?

722
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,180
Oh, he--He's fine. Sure.

723
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,680
He--He has been up
almost a week, now.

724
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,180
Good.

725
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,190
Where's Rio?

726
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:57,190
R--Rio? Oh, yes.

727
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,690
Oh, so that's what
all the yelling was about, eh?

728
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,700
I'll go and call her for you.
Now, wait a minute.

729
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,700
You made enough noise
now to raise the dead.

730
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,210
Oh. So that's it.

731
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,720
All right, where is he?

732
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
He's getting dressed.

733
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:32,730
Well, maybe I better
give him a hand.

734
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,730
No, no, Doc. Please,
let me talk to you first.

735
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:43,240
What got into ya? Were ya drunk?
What happened to ya?

736
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,240
I don't know.

737
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,240
He's a devil.
He did the same to me.

738
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,740
He can charm a bird
right out of a bush.

739
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,750
Yes, or a--

740
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,250
I never saw it to fail.

741
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,750
Don't talk that way, Doc.

742
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,260
What do you want me to say?
"Bless you, my children"?

743
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,260
You might as well.

744
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,760
Huh?

745
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,260
I'm married to him.

746
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,760
You're what?

747
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,270
That's the truth, Doc.

748
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,770
Only, please don't tell him.

749
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,770
Tell who?

750
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,280
Billy.

751
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,280
You mean to say
he doesn't know it?

752
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,780
No.

753
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,780
Then how could you
be married to him?

754
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,780
He was out of his mind.

755
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,290
I never would have done it,
only I thought he was gonna die.

756
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,290
And so he would have

757
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:38,290
If it hadn't been for you.

758
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,290
I don't want his gratitude.

759
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,800
Yeah, I guess I should have

760
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,310
Stayed out in the rain
with the sheriff.

761
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,810
Make me a cup of coffee.

762
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,310
Sure, Doc. Sure.

763
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,820
It's a good thing
you don't want his gratitude.

764
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,320
Why do you say that?

765
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,320
You know, when I come to think
of it, after what you done to me

766
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,330
I couldn't wish
for anything better

767
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,830
Than you hooking up with Billy.

768
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,830
What do you mean?

769
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,840
Oh, I--I wouldn't wanna
spoil it for you.

770
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,840
[Door opens]

771
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,340
Hello, Doc.

772
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
Is that all
you've got to say to me?

773
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,370
Now, look here, Doc. I'm sorry,
but it's your own fault.

774
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,870
Oh, my fault, huh?

775
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,370
Who brought me here?

776
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:00,870
Yeah, now you wanna
switch the blame on me.

777
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,880
First you take my horse,
and then my girl,

778
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,380
And both times
it's all my fault.

779
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,880
That reminds me
of something else.

780
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,890
You ran away with Red,
didn't you?

781
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,390
Think that's any excuse?

782
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,390
It was good enough for me.

783
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:20,890
Doc: There's only
one trouble with it.

784
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,400
What's that?

785
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,900
The horse was mine too.

786
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,400
I wasn't in much shape
to argue that with you, was I?

787
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,910
No, I guess you weren't.

788
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,410
But you didn't have
much use for that horse

789
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,910
Lying flat on your back...
or did ya?

790
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:44,920
All right, Doc, if that's
your way of looking at it.

791
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,920
You just took
the loan of him, so to speak.

792
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,420
Say, what are you getting at?

793
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,930
Yes, that's what
I’d like to know.

794
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:57,930
You borrow from me,
I borrow from you.

795
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,940
What does that mean?

796
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,940
Let's have a cup of java.

797
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,440
We'd better be
getting out of here, huh, Doc?

798
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,940
Not at those prices.

799
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,950
All right, Doc,
I’ll tell you what I’ll do.

800
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,950
What's that?

801
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:19,450
Well, just to show ya
my heart's in the right place...

802
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,460
...I’ll let you take your pick.

803
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,970
Huh?

804
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,470
You mean
you'd trade me for a horse?

805
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,970
It's up to Doc.

806
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:38,470
After all, I’ve got to think
of the other fella, you know?

807
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,980
Well, I appreciate that, Billy.
I sure do.

808
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,480
Billy, you don't mean that.

809
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:55,490
And after all she did for you.

810
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,990
Say, you should have seen what
that little horse did for me,

811
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,990
Huh, Doc?

812
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:02,500
That's right.

813
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,000
I, uh, hope you won't
think too hard of me,

814
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,510
But, uh, under
the circumstances,

815
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,510
I'm going to take the horse.

816
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,510
You are?

817
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:17,010
You're not satisfied?

818
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,510
Listen, Doc, I like
that little horse.

819
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
What'd I tell ya? Huh?

820
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,520
I still can't believe it.

821
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,520
What are you talkin' about?

822
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,030
Nothing.
Say, what's eating you?

823
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,530
Nothing.

824
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,040
Here, uh, fill these
with fresh water.

825
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,550
The creeks are muddy
as all get out.

826
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,050
How about grub?

827
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,550
Can you spare us
enough flour and bacon

828
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:55,550
To get us to Fort Sumner?

829
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,050
Sure. Sure, Doc.

830
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,050
Hey, it's clearing up.

831
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,560
We'd better be getting out of--

832
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,060
Lend me some dough, will ya?

833
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,070
How much do you want?

834
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,080
About 50 bucks.

835
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,580
There's 40.

836
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,090
Here.

837
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,100
Buy yourself a horse and buggy.

838
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,600
Don't ya think it's too much?

839
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,610
You can give aunt Guadalupe 20
if you want.

840
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:59,110
If we get located in
Fort Sumner, I’ll send for ya.

841
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,610
What for?

842
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,120
I can't stand ranch cookin'.

843
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,630
Here you are, Doc.

844
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,140
Thanks. Goodbye.
Bye, Doc.

845
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,650
Bye, lollipop.

846
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:39,150
Bye, Billy.
Take care of yourself.

847
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,650
You do the same.

848
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,150
Fill these up for Doc.

849
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,660
Hello, you old hay bag.

850
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,170
Have you missed me?

851
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:31,090
Say, he's thin as a rail.

852
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:34,090
He's been getting
a little exercise.

853
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,590
Where'd you get that plug?

854
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,590
I wore out
that black horse I had,

855
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:40,600
So I traded him
to a sheepherder for this one.

856
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,600
He's all right.
Little wild, yet.

857
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,600
Come on.

858
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:18,970
Ain't Red a sweetheart?

859
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,970
Doc: I’m going
to let ya have

860
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:20,920
The loan of him
for a little while.

861
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,920
Huh?

862
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,420
Until ya get
your strength back.

863
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,430
Say, you're not gonna
do me any favors.

864
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:27,930
What's the matter with you?

865
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,930
I don't wanna be
obligated to you about Red.

866
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:30,930
Why not?

867
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:33,430
'Cause I haven't given up
getting Red back yet.

868
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:36,440
Any more than I’ve given up
getting on this ornery goat.

869
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,420
Bye, Rio.

870
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,150
What's the matter?

871
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:23,150
Boy, am I tuckered.

872
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,670
What are you lookin' for?

873
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:42,170
Sack of tobacco.

874
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,670
Say, is there anything of mine
you don't cotton to?

875
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:46,170
I guess I forgot.
Yeah.

876
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:47,670
It's a bad habit you've got.
What?

877
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,180
Forgettin' what
belongs to other people.

878
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:51,180
You think I did it on purpose?
Yes.

879
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,180
Listen, mister, I don't
feel any too good as it is.

880
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,680
Neither do I.

881
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,690
You wanna make
something out of it?

882
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,190
That's a big advantage
you're taking.

883
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,690
I can't help it.

884
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:04,690
I'm so plumb beat out, I’ll be
lucky if I can draw 'em clear.

885
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,690
Oh, I don't wanna
crowd a sick man.

886
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,200
I'm all right.
Just give me 40 winks

887
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,700
And I’ll take ya on
with both hands free.

888
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,700
Well, I guess this is as good
a place as any to make camp.

889
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,210
No water.

890
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:21,710
No, and you won't find any
between here and Fort Sumner.

891
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,210
That's a long ways off.

892
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:29,720
When we get there, our friend
the sheriff won't be far behind.

893
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,720
Huh?

894
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:42,030
Garrett?

895
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:45,980
How do you know
it's him?

896
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,980
I can tell him
farther off than that.

897
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,990
He wouldn't be coming
after the two of us alone.

898
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:55,490
Maybe he's lost
too many of his friends.

899
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:00,500
How come you didn't
knock him over?

900
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,500
Or did you try?
Did I?

901
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,500
That's what I said. Did you?

902
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,500
Didn't do nothin' else.

903
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,010
Who do you suppose
put him on our trail?

904
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:19,010
Well, maybe somebody
saw us pulling out, or, uh--

905
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,520
Or what?

906
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:25,020
Nothing.
Sure, she was the one.

907
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,520
Yeah, Rio.

908
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:31,530
Why do you suppose she had to
up and do a thing like that?

909
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,030
Well, women are funny.

910
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,540
Hey, go easy on that water.

911
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,540
We've only got two canteens
to get us to Fort Sumner.

912
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,540
[Spits]

913
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,040
What's the matter?

914
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,550
Look.

915
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:55,050
Sweet spirits of niter.

916
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,050
The little darling
put sand in instead of water.

917
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:00,060
Now, that sure is
one for the book.

918
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,560
Well, no use hangin' around here
holding postmortems.

919
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,060
Let's get goin'.

920
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:43,230
You know, Doc, I think
I’ll have another drink.

921
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,180
What are you talking about?

922
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,190
You didn't have one
in the first place.

923
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,690
No, but I had the same notion
about an hour ago.

924
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,700
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking,

925
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,700
But it won't do you any good.

926
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,200
Take my advice.

927
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,200
What?

928
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,700
Killing a woman.

929
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:09,210
Why not?
Ah, they're all alike.

930
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,710
There isn't anything
they wouldn't do for ya...

931
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:14,710
Or to ya.

932
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,190
[Sighs]

933
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,700
Hey, why didn't you wake me up?

934
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,700
We should have
got started long ago.

935
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,200
Garrett: Keep 'em up.

936
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,710
Oh, hello, Pat.

937
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,720
Where's Billy?

938
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,720
Looks like he left ya.

939
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:03,230
And on my horse, eh?

940
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:05,730
Try those on.

941
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:08,230
Oh, you know me, Pat.

942
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:10,240
Do I have to put
these things on?

943
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,240
I know ya.

944
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,740
Put 'em on.

945
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:37,570
That was pretty smart,
putting sand in those canteens.

946
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:42,080
I had to give you something
for your money, didn't I?

947
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,080
Oh, I see.

948
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,530
So you sent the sheriff after us
for good measure, huh?

949
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,540
No wonder he came alone.

950
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,450
All he had to do
was take his time

951
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:54,460
And wait for the sun
to finish us off.

952
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,460
Then how did ya get back?

953
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,350
It was pretty tough.

954
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,850
But the more I thought
about seeing you, darling,

955
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:05,350
The easier it got.

956
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,810
Well, what are you waiting for?

957
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,810
Go ahead.

958
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,810
Say, that sounds real nice.

959
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:19,320
I like to hear you ask for it.
Keep it up. Beg some more.

960
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,290
What would you like me to say?

961
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:33,800
Well, you might say
"please" very sweetly.

962
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,750
Please.

963
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,260
Will you keep your eyes open?

964
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,760
Yes.

965
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,730
Will you look
right at me while I do it?

966
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:29,640
Huh.
  What is it?

967
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,640
Everybody drinks but me.

968
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,640
I'm supposed to be a camel, huh?

969
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,140
You want a drink,
you can climb down and get it.

970
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,160
[Muffled moaning]

971
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,660
Say, did you hear something?

972
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,170
What kind of a track is that?

973
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:05,670
I don't know.

974
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:07,170
Too small for a man.

975
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:11,180
There's another one.

976
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,680
Couple over there.

977
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:26,690
Oh, take a look at that.

978
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,700
[Moaning]

979
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,200
Yeah, it's an old Indian trick,

980
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,700
Soaking rawhide in water
to make it shrink.

981
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,210
Another hour, she'd have been
hanging by her wrists.

982
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,710
Well, I’ll say
one thing for Billy.

983
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:45,210
He sure does pay off poetic.

984
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,210
He put her right where
she could see the water.

985
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:50,220
He just left here,
less than half an hour ago.

986
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,720
He went that way.
Toward those mountains.

987
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,220
Are you all right?
Sit down here.

988
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,220
Don't worry about me.
Go on after him.

989
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:57,220
Well, we can't catch him now.
Why not?

990
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:00,230
He's got too much of
a head start on us. Sit down.

991
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,240
You know, I think
he's in love with you.

992
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,240
What are you talkin' about?

993
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,740
The crazier a man is
about a woman,

994
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,740
The crazier he thinks,
and the crazier he does.

995
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:21,750
He's only crazy
about one thing. Himself.

996
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,750
Hey, that gives me
a thought.

997
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,750
Maybe we'll get
Mr. Billy after all.

998
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:29,760
How?
Well, just like he says.

999
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,760
If he's crazy enough
to do you like this,

1000
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,760
Maybe he's just crazy enough
to come back to turn you loose.

1001
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
You're the one
that's crazy.

1002
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,270
He doesn't care anything
about me. He'd never come back.

1003
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:42,770
Maybe so,
but it's worth tryin'.

1004
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:44,770
Ain't it, Doc?

1005
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,270
Well, if he's fool enough
to come back,

1006
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,270
He oughta get himself caught.

1007
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,780
I told you
not to breathe so loud.

1008
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:00,790
All right,
all right, all right.

1009
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,820
Well, how do you like it?

1010
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,330
Hmm, I thought I tied it
tighter than that.

1011
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,830
You came back.

1012
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:50,840
You don't think I did it
on your account, do ya?

1013
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,340
You didn't?

1014
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:54,340
Have you seen anything
of Doc and the sheriff?

1015
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:57,840
Garrett: Here we are, Billy,
right behind ya.

1016
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,850
And put those hands
where they belong.

1017
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:02,850
Say, why didn't you tip me off?

1018
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,360
Hurry up with that grub. I wanna
get back to town before dark.

1019
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,860
Well, I’ve only got two hands.

1020
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,860
Well, why don't
you use both of 'em?

1021
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,370
I'll use one on you
in a minute.

1022
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:22,370
I wouldn't put it past you.

1023
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:26,370
Now's your chance with me
all trussed up like a chicken.

1024
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:32,380
Here we are together again.
Same old happy family.

1025
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
Yeah, and I’d have been halfway
to Fort Sumner by now

1026
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,380
If it hadn't been for you.
Me?

1027
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,880
Yeah, you.

1028
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,390
Give me a cigarette.

1029
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:44,890
Nah, you mean her.

1030
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:46,890
Rio?

1031
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,390
Say, are you out of your mind?

1032
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,400
Why don't you come out
and admit it, like a man?

1033
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,900
Admit what?

1034
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
You didn't know
that Pat had caught me

1035
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,900
Until you got back
to our camp, did you?

1036
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,400
No.

1037
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,410
Then what's the use
of coming after us?

1038
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:01,910
Why not?

1039
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,410
Well, we'd have been
clear to Lincoln

1040
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,910
Before you even got back here.

1041
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:09,420
Say, mister,
what are you tryin' to make out?

1042
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,920
Well, I heard you say once
you didn't like ranch cooking,

1043
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,420
So I guess you figured you'd
better come back and get Rio.

1044
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,920
Ah, you're daffy. I wouldn't
come back two inches to get her.

1045
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,430
You did.
I tell you I didn't.

1046
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,430
Actions speak louder
than words.

1047
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:23,930
Do they?

1048
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:26,430
All right, I’ll show you
how much I care about her.

1049
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:29,430
If you want her back
you can have her. And welcome.

1050
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:31,440
Now what do you think
about that?

1051
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,940
I don't want her.

1052
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,950
Cattle don't graze
after sheep.

1053
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:40,950
Sheep?

1054
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,450
Sheep, did you say?

1055
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:47,450
I didn't say goats
or monkeys.

1056
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:49,450
Why, you--

1057
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,460
Ah, sit down.

1058
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,470
What's the matter with you?

1059
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:04,970
None of your business.

1060
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:06,970
Careful, young fella.

1061
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:12,980
You want it now? I've just been
waitin' for an excuse like this.

1062
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,480
Hey!

1063
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:19,490
I'll fix you up.

1064
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,500
Never mind fixin'
any more food.

1065
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,010
We're leavin' now.
Come on.

1066
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:42,510
Let me get a drink first.

1067
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:44,510
All right, hurry up.

1068
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,520
Hey, Rio, come here and hold
my hands so I won't fall in.

1069
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,540
Come out of there.

1070
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,460
You're all right now.
Come on.

1071
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:03,470
You're figuring on takin' us
back to Lincoln, ain't ya?

1072
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:05,970
Where'd ya think
I was takin' ya?

1073
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,480
It's over that way, ain't it?

1074
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,980
Sure, it's over that way.
What are you gettin' at?

1075
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,480
Take a look.

1076
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:27,000
Hey, Doc.

1077
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,510
Well, the Mescaleros
are out early this year.

1078
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:40,010
They're talkin' about us,
ain't they?

1079
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:43,510
Yeah, they're--They're tipping
off another hunting party

1080
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,510
That must be out somewhere.

1081
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,510
Right over there.

1082
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,530
Hmm. On both sides of us.

1083
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:02,530
Well, I guess our best chance is
to high-tail it to Fort Sumner.

1084
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:04,530
Don't figure on me
doing much high-tailing.

1085
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:05,530
Why not?

1086
01:20:05,530 --> 01:20:08,540
I ain't no acrobat.
Oh.

1087
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,540
Well, I hope you fellas

1088
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,540
Will have sense enough
to behave yourselves.

1089
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,540
Why, sure, Pat. Certainly.

1090
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,050
Sure, Pat.

1091
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,060
Thank you.

1092
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,070
No, you don't.

1093
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:39,570
That's your horse over there.

1094
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,570
Who says so?

1095
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,570
I say so.
Get on him and hurry up.

1096
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:46,570
Rio, you ride the paint.

1097
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,080
Thanks.

1098
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:01,090
Hey, Red's my horse.

1099
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,590
I know he is,
but I’m gonna ride him.

1100
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:06,150
I don't like this.

1101
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:09,160
Looks like some of those
Mescaleros are ahead of us too.

1102
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,660
No, no, you--You better not
come over here, Rio.

1103
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:13,660
Why not?

1104
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,160
They put the fire on them.

1105
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,170
Those Mescaleros
sure do play for keeps.

1106
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:20,670
Say, what's that?

1107
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:34,180
It's a good-size party. We'll be
knee-deep in them in a minute.

1108
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,180
Look over there too.

1109
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:47,700
Hey, what are ya doin'?

1110
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,700
What do you think I’m doing?
I want my guns.

1111
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,200
Ah, now, wait a minute.

1112
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,200
You're not gonna argue
at a time like this, Pat.

1113
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,710
Aren't you gonna
give us a chance?

1114
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,210
He'd like to see them
put the fire on me.

1115
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:00,210
I sure would.
What about her?

1116
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,710
Well, we can't
talk about it now.

1117
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:06,210
I wanna know one thing--
Do I have your solemn promise

1118
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:07,720
That you'll give them back
when I ask for them?

1119
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,720
Sure, what do you think
we are?

1120
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,220
Will you see to it
that he does?

1121
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:12,220
Now, who's gonna
see to it that I do?

1122
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:13,720
I'll take your word for it.

1123
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,230
Where are my cartridges?

1124
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:19,230
Here you are.
Now, what do we do?

1125
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:20,730
Make a stand or run for it?

1126
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:22,230
Can't make a stand here.

1127
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,230
I know something
that might work.

1128
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:25,730
What is it?
Come on, do exactly what I do.

1129
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:07,900
Cut 'em loose!

1130
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,680
Garrett: I know this place.

1131
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:49,690
We're about 40 miles
from Fort Sumner.

1132
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,190
Señor Garrett. What
are you doing up this way?

1133
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:58,200
Hello, Pablo. Can you
put us up for the night?

1134
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,200
Sure, glad to have you.
Go right in. My house is yours.

1135
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,200
I'll take care of the horses.

1136
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:22,720
Well, boys, I guess we're
out of the woods now. Huh?

1137
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,220
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1138
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:35,230
Oh. No, I--I wouldn't be
too sure of that, Pat.

1139
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,240
Oh, yes, he's right, Pat.

1140
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,740
Those Mescaleros
don't give up so easy.

1141
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:14,270
Pablo.

1142
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,780
This is very important.

1143
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:21,280
I want you
to ride to Fort Sumner

1144
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:24,280
And give this note
to the town marshal.

1145
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:29,790
Did he say town marshal?

1146
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:32,290
That's what
it sounded like to me.

1147
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:31,350
Thanks, Rio.

1148
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,380
It certainly is
a beautiful night out.

1149
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,890
I think I’ll take
a little stroll.

1150
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:11,390
And, uh, gentlemen,

1151
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:14,890
Just in case I shouldn't
return before you retire,

1152
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,890
I'll say good night now.

1153
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,400
I think I’ll go with ya.

1154
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,400
Well, Billy, you've been
pretty good to my little horse,

1155
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,410
And I guess the least I can do

1156
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:31,410
Is to let you
say goodbye to him.

1157
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:33,910
That's awfully nice of ya, Doc.

1158
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:36,910
Oh, I always like
to think of the other fellow.

1159
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:39,920
So if you'll just stand
right here in this doorway

1160
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,920
And don't make no warlike moves,

1161
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,920
Then you can wave farewell
to him as we ride off.

1162
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,430
In other words,
you think you're gonna leave.

1163
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:52,930
I'm sorry, Pat,
I--I hate to eat and run,

1164
01:30:52,930 --> 01:30:54,930
But, uh, well,
you know how it is.

1165
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:58,440
Listen, Doc.

1166
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,440
You're only
wasting your time, Pat.

1167
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,940
Haven't you
forgotten something?

1168
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,450
No, I don't think so.
Good night, all.

1169
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,950
Say, Doc.

1170
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:14,950
Yes, what is it?

1171
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:17,460
I'm afraid you'll have
to listen to me for a minute.

1172
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,460
Why?

1173
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:28,970
What if I don't feel like
wavin' goodbye to Red?

1174
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:31,970
Oh, you still think you got

1175
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,970
Something to say
about that horse, eh?

1176
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:36,470
Yes, I do.

1177
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,480
All right, go ahead and say it.

1178
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:47,490
That's a pretty big advantage
to give a man like you.

1179
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:49,490
Didn't you tell me that once?

1180
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,000
How's this?

1181
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,500
You don't have to go that far.

1182
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,500
Thanks.

1183
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:10,510
What about him?
Will he leave us alone?

1184
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:14,510
Or do you think we ought to
pull his teeth before we start?

1185
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:17,020
Don't worry about me.

1186
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:21,520
I wouldn't lift a finger, Doc,
to keep you from killing him.

1187
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,520
You and me never had any trouble
till he came along.

1188
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:31,530
He'll keep out of it.
All right, son. I'm waiting.

1189
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:33,030
[Clatter] Put those plates down.

1190
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:35,030
You're making me nervous.

1191
01:32:36,530 --> 01:32:39,040
Billy, he'll kill ya.
What do you care?

1192
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,540
But you can get another horse.
I want this one.

1193
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:42,540
Why?

1194
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,540
I wanna see if I can
teach him to make smoke

1195
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:45,540
Come out of his ears.

1196
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,050
Say, I haven't got all night.

1197
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:49,550
Get back against that wall.

1198
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,550
But, Billy--
Go on.

1199
01:32:53,550 --> 01:32:55,550
And count up to three.

1200
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:59,060
I won't. You're out
of your mind. Both of ya.

1201
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,560
How 'bout you, Pat?

1202
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,060
Sure, I’ll be glad to.

1203
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,070
You're too willing.
I don't trust ya.

1204
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,080
I think I’d rather have
that cuckoo clock

1205
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,580
Do the counting for me.

1206
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,580
Yeah, that's good enough.

1207
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,590
It's gonna strike in a minute.

1208
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,090
Shall we pull
on the last cuckoo?

1209
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:32,090
All right.

1210
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,100
Well, Billy,
I guess this is it.

1211
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,600
Men are pretty much like
children, after all.

1212
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,610
Have you ever seen two kids
wrestling in the yard?

1213
01:33:49,610 --> 01:33:51,610
They push and tussle and maybe

1214
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:55,110
They look like they're fighting,
but they're not.

1215
01:33:55,110 --> 01:34:00,120
They're really friends.
And everything's in fun.

1216
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,120
Then, pretty soon,
they play a little too rough.

1217
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,120
One of 'em gets mad,

1218
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,630
And in the end,
somebody always gets hurt.

1219
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:14,630
So for you and me, this is
where somebody gets hurt.

1220
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:18,640
But when it's over,
and however it turns out, son,

1221
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,140
No hard feelings.

1222
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:24,140
Doc--

1223
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,140
[Cuckoo clock strikes]

1224
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,650
[Cuckoo]

1225
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:33,650
[Cuckoo]

1226
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:37,660
[Cuckoo]

1227
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,660
[Cuckoo]

1228
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,160
[Cuckoo]

1229
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:50,170
[Cuckoo]

1230
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:54,170
[Cuckoo]

1231
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,680
Why didn't ya draw?

1232
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,680
I changed my mind.

1233
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,190
Sure you did.
You lost your nerve.

1234
01:35:08,190 --> 01:35:10,190
I always knew you were
nothin' but a show-off.

1235
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:13,190
Shut up. Why did you change your
mind? This some trick of yours?

1236
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:19,700
No, I just don't feel like it.
Maybe I ate too much.

1237
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,700
But some other night,
you will feel like it, eh?

1238
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,710
Who knows?

1239
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:32,210
That's no good, Billy.

1240
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:34,710
If you and I are bound
to fight sooner or later,

1241
01:35:34,710 --> 01:35:38,220
I'd rather do it now
and have it over with.

1242
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:42,220
You've been ready to pull on me
every day since I met you.

1243
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,720
I never wanted it, but I waited

1244
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,730
And let you pick
your own time and place.

1245
01:35:47,730 --> 01:35:49,730
You've done that tonight.

1246
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:52,230
Are ya gonna draw
or do I have to make ya?

1247
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:12,250
Are you gonna fight or do you
want me to nick your ears?

1248
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,260
Doc, have you gone loco?

1249
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:39,280
What's the matter
with you, Billy?

1250
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,780
I didn't think
you'd take this off anybody.

1251
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:45,280
Maybe I wouldn't
off anybody else.

1252
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,790
What do you mean by that?

1253
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,790
Doc, don't listen
to that kinda talk.

1254
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:52,290
Haven't you ever seen
a case of cold feet before?

1255
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:55,290
He never had cold feet
in his life.

1256
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:56,790
What is it, Billy?

1257
01:36:56,790 --> 01:37:00,800
I guess that idea about the
cuckoo clock wasn't so good.

1258
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,800
Why?

1259
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,810
Well, it gave me time to think
and remember a few things.

1260
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:10,310
You're the only partner
I ever had.

1261
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:16,310
Gosh, do ya really
feel that way, son?

1262
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,820
I treated you
worse than anyone.

1263
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,820
Nah, it was all my fault, I--

1264
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:28,330
I had no business getting sore
and cutting you up this way.

1265
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:29,830
Come on, let's get out of here.

1266
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:31,830
No, we'd better split.

1267
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:33,330
Split? What for?

1268
01:37:33,330 --> 01:37:35,330
Well, I wouldn't want to make
Red carry the both of us.

1269
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,330
Oh, don't worry.

1270
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:39,840
We'll find a better way
than that to divide him up.

1271
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,840
Say, you can
ride him out of here.

1272
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,340
No, I had him last.

1273
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:46,840
Yeah, that's right,
come to think of it.

1274
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:31,390
Doc: I ain't worried about

1275
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:33,890
You and me
ever fighting now, Billy.

1276
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:36,890
Because one thing is certain--

1277
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:39,900
If we didn't do it tonight,
we never will.

1278
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,400
Come on, let's go.

1279
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:50,910
Uh, so long, Pat.
Don't take any wooden nickels.

1280
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,420
You're not goin' with him.

1281
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:01,420
Now, look here.
You ain't gonna

1282
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,420
Start something
with the two of us, are ya?

1283
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,430
I might have known
you'd do this to me.

1284
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:12,930
Ever since you met him,
you've treated me like a dog.

1285
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,430
The very first day,
you sided with him against me,

1286
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:18,440
And made me
the laughing stock of the town!

1287
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,440
Take it easy.

1288
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:25,440
I gave you your guns so you'd
have a chance for your life,

1289
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,440
And now you tell me I’ve gotta

1290
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:28,450
Fight the two of you
to get them back.

1291
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:31,950
You stand there,

1292
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,950
Side by side with
that little snip of a kid,

1293
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:36,450
Against me?

1294
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:40,960
Me! I was the oldest
and best friend you ever had!

1295
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,960
And I still would be

1296
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,960
If it wasn't for him!

1297
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:49,970
Say, mister, that's about enough
out of you for one night.

1298
01:39:49,970 --> 01:39:52,470
Wait a minute, Billy.
You let me handle this.

1299
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,970
Pat is a friend of mine.

1300
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:57,480
I don't wanna kill him and
I don't want you to kill him.

1301
01:39:57,470 --> 01:39:58,980
Is that clear?

1302
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:07,990
Pat, you're just getting
yourself all steamed up.

1303
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:09,490
I'll be seeing you
one of these days

1304
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:11,490
And we'll have
a good laugh about all this.

1305
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,990
Well, so long.

1306
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,000
Be careful. You know you haven't
got a chance against me.

1307
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:36,010
Goodbye.

1308
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:43,520
Goodbye, Pat.

1309
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:55,530
Say--
Don't, son.

1310
01:40:55,530 --> 01:40:57,030
Please don't do that.

1311
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,550
Oh, Doc. Lie down.

1312
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:12,550
No.
Why not?

1313
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:16,050
No, that--That's one thing
I’ve always been afraid of.

1314
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:19,560
What?
Dying in bed.

1315
01:41:24,060 --> 01:41:26,560
Doc!

1316
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:31,070
Why didn't you shoot?
You had me beat a mile.

1317
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:32,570
You had me cold!

1318
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:38,530
Maybe I don't like cold meat,
Pat.

1319
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:04,430
Well, go ahead.

1320
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,940
Go ahead what?

1321
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:10,440
Aren't you going to say
something over Doc?

1322
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:15,450
I don't know what to say.

1323
01:42:15,450 --> 01:42:17,950
I never said anything
over anybody I killed before.

1324
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:22,450
I think we ought
to say something over Doc.

1325
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:25,460
You'd better do it.

1326
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:35,970
So long, Doc.

1327
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,980
Pat?

1328
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,480
I want you to know I’m sorry.

1329
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:54,990
I honestly am.

1330
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:59,490
Last night
I was ready to kill you.

1331
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:02,490
But in the daylight,
I can see things much better.

1332
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:07,500
You and Doc
had been friends for years.

1333
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:11,000
If I hadn't come between you,

1334
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
None of this
would have happened.

1335
01:43:15,010 --> 01:43:17,510
It sure is funny

1336
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:20,510
How two or three trails

1337
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:24,510
Can cross
and get all tangled up.

1338
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:28,520
Well, go ahead.

1339
01:43:35,530 --> 01:43:37,030
After you.

1340
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:42,530
Say, you don't think I’d shoot
you in the back, do you?

1341
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:46,040
I don't know,
but I ain't gonna tempt you.

1342
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:48,040
I don't think you're
gonna be fool enough

1343
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,540
To try to do it from the front.

1344
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:53,540
You never trust anybody,
do you?

1345
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,550
I apologize, Pat.

1346
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:00,050
Go ahead.

1347
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:22,070
Who's that?

1348
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:28,080
Where's Pat?

1349
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,580
He's still in the house.

1350
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,580
What's he doing?

1351
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,580
He's not gonna try to stop you.

1352
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:34,580
How do you know?

1353
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:37,590
He told me so.

1354
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:39,090
Huh.

1355
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,600
Say, Billy--

1356
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,100
Can I see you for a minute?

1357
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:57,610
What do you want?

1358
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:02,610
If that's the way
you feel about it, never mind.

1359
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:09,620
At least I’m not afraid
to turn my back on you.

1360
01:45:17,130 --> 01:45:18,630
Here, hold these a minute.

1361
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:14,690
I thought you might like to have
Doc's guns as a keepsake.

1362
01:46:21,690 --> 01:46:24,190
Say, I sure would.

1363
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:27,700
Thanks, Pat. Thanks a whole lot.

1364
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:31,700
I never had an extra pair.
Black holsters too.

1365
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,210
They'd go nice with Sunday
clothes, if I ever get any.

1366
01:46:40,210 --> 01:46:42,710
Do you think they'll suit you?

1367
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:45,220
If the barrels ain't too long.

1368
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,720
No, they're just the same.

1369
01:46:59,230 --> 01:47:01,730
Be careful. They're loaded.

1370
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:07,240
That's right.

1371
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:23,750
Say, I think they're even better
balanced than mine.

1372
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:28,260
Then how about
letting me have yours?

1373
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,760
My guns? What for?

1374
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:41,270
If I had your guns,

1375
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:46,280
I could say it was you out there
in that grave, instead of Doc.

1376
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:49,780
Huh? You'd pass Doc off as me?

1377
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:51,780
Sure.

1378
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,790
Everybody would believe me

1379
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:58,290
Once they saw Billy the kid's
six-shooters.

1380
01:47:58,790 --> 01:48:01,290
You could leave an end
to your trail right here.

1381
01:48:01,290 --> 01:48:03,790
Nobody'd follow you up north.

1382
01:48:03,790 --> 01:48:07,800
All your troubles would
be buried. Past and present.

1383
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,800
You and Rio could go off
with nothing to worry about.

1384
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:22,310
How come you'd do
a favor like that for me?

1385
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:25,320
There you go again, Billy.

1386
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,320
Distrustin' a person who's
tryin' to be decent to you.

1387
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:38,330
Don't you realize
that's your whole trouble?

1388
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:42,330
Don't you see that's what's
gotten you into all your fights?

1389
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:43,330
You've got more enemies

1390
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:46,840
Than anybody
in this part of the country.

1391
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,840
How do you expect
to get along with people

1392
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:52,840
When you think every man
who holds his hand out to you

1393
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,850
Has a knife behind his back?

1394
01:48:55,850 --> 01:49:01,850
Son, I--I just don't know
what's going to become of you.

1395
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:03,850
Honest, I don't.

1396
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:09,360
Oh, I didn't mean anything.
I'm sorry.

1397
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:13,860
That's the spirit.

1398
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:15,870
That's my boy.

1399
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:17,870
Now, give me those guns
and clear out of here

1400
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:19,370
Before it's too late.

1401
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,380
What's the matter?

1402
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,890
Nothing.

1403
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,390
But I’ve had these guns
a long time.

1404
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:40,890
I sure hate to let go of 'em.

1405
01:49:43,390 --> 01:49:45,900
Billy, I’ve been
pretty patient with you--

1406
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,900
Oh!

1407
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:51,400
Billy, my son.

1408
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,400
It's your duty to give them up.

1409
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:55,910
You owe it to yourself.

1410
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:58,410
You ought to start
a new life today.

1411
01:49:58,410 --> 01:50:00,910
Those guns are
the badge of your shame.

1412
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:03,410
They represent everything
you must leave behind you.

1413
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:04,920
Don't you realize that?

1414
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:06,920
Don't you understand

1415
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,420
That if you're going
to start all over again,

1416
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:13,420
Your hands must be clean?

1417
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:19,430
I guess you're right, Pat.

1418
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:22,930
I never thought of it like that.

1419
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,440
Thanks, Pat.

1420
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:38,950
Billy, you don't know
what this means to me.

1421
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:42,950
You'll never forget this day.

1422
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:03,970
Goodbye, Pat.

1423
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:06,980
Why do you say that?

1424
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:09,480
Why shouldn't I?

1425
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:12,980
Why should you?
You ain't goin' anywhere.

1426
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,980
Hmm?

1427
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,490
I took the firing pins
out of those guns.

1428
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:20,490
Hmm?

1429
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Why, you--

1430
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:40,010
Nothing would make me happier
than for you to keep coming.

1431
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,020
[Click]

1432
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,030
[Click]

1433
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:02,530
[Sighs]

1434
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,540
Is that one of your own guns?

1435
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,550
It sure looks like it.

1436
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:19,050
How did you get it?

1437
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:23,550
You dirty little cheat.

1438
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:26,560
You switched those guns on me!

1439
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:29,060
Of all the dirty,
rotten tricks! I--

1440
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:32,060
I didn't mean to, Pat.

1441
01:52:32,060 --> 01:52:34,060
Honest I didn't.

1442
01:52:34,060 --> 01:52:37,070
They must have gotten mixed up
while I was playing with 'em.

1443
01:52:58,090 --> 01:52:59,590
Thanks.

1444
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:06,600
I left my guns right there.

1445
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:12,600
What for?

1446
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:16,110
Didn't you say you'd have
to show them to everybody

1447
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:20,110
To make people believe
that story of yours?

1448
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:23,610
You see, I have an idea that
you'd rather give Doc the credit

1449
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:26,620
For doing you up like this.

1450
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:28,120
Because I think
you'd rather be dead

1451
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:31,120
Than have people know
Billy the kid did this to ya.

1452
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:37,130
Goodbye, Pat.

1453
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:51,140
You don't wanna go off
without your canteens, do you?

1454
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:52,640
Did you fill 'em up for me?

1455
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,140
Yes.

1456
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:09,660
