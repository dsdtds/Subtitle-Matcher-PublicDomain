1
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,870
National Socialism Will reshape the
World Adolf Hitler

2
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,570
the symbols and the leaders change,
but Germany's Will on others...

3
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,870
.. continue from generation to
generation.

4
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,570
In the last 75 years, this magnum
has cost the World...

5
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,470
.. more than 20 million killed,
more than 60 million Wounded...

6
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,870
.. more than 200 million
made homeless.

7
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,770
this does not include the untold
millions that died of disease...

8
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,670
.. resulting from War.

9
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,670
Or the billions upon billions of
dollars Worth of property destroyed.

10
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,070
Nor does this include the grief...

11
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,470
.. the anguish...

12
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,870
.. the misery... the terror
that the World has sufered.

13
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,670
Due to the German's insane passion to
enforce their rule upon their neighbors.

14
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,370
this passion for conquest,
reached its histerical climax...

15
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,970
.. When Adolf Hitler enthroned himself
as God and the German Führer

16
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,970
What fantastic dreams Was this
humorless man dreaming

17
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,370
..as he stood at Nürnberg and looked
doWn on his fanatic folloWers.

18
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,570
In the MiddleAges, a plague of
slavery descended on the World.

19
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,870
Out of the Wilds of Mongolia, came
a mighty army of fierce horsemen...

20
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,570
.. led by Djengis Khan.

21
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,470
Burning, looting, pillaging.

22
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,470
the Barbarian horde sWept across
Asia and Eastern Europe.

23
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,570
Djengis Khan conquered most of
the World of the 13th century

24
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,870
Adolf Hitler Was determined
to outdo him...

25
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,570
.. and conquer all of the World
of the 20th.

26
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,570
Set up at Munich Was an institute
devoted to the little knoWn...

27
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,570
..science of geo politics.

28
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:55,570
Vaguely defined as the military
control of space.

29
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,270
Germany's leading geo-politician
a former General...

30
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,670
.. Karl Haushofer, Was head man.

31
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,170
Here Was gathered together more
information about your home toWn...

32
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,670
.. than you yourself know

33
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,370
to the German geo-politician
the World is not made up of...

34
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,470
..men, and Women and children Who live
and love and dream of better things.

35
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,670
It is made up of only two elements
labor and raW materials.

36
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,470
It is made up of only two elements
labor and raW materials.

37
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,070
the geo-politicians job Was to
transform Hitler's ambition to control...

38
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,870
.. these elements into cold
hard reality.

39
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,770
On their map, our planet is neatly
divided into land and Water.

40
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,670
Water forms 3/4 of the earth's
surface, land only 1/4.

41
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,770
And in that 1/4 of the earth's
surface, lies the World's Wealth.

42
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,570
All its natural resources.

43
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,170
And the World's manpoWer.

44
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,070
Control the land and you
control the World.

45
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,570
that Was Hitler's theory.

46
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,870
this all important land, the geo-
politicians noW break up into two areas.

47
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,370
One the Western hemisphere, Which
together With Australia and all the...

48
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,970
.. islands of the World including Japan,
comprises 1/3 of the land area.

49
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,070
the other area, Which consists of
Europe, Asia and Africa...

50
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,370
.. makes up the other 2/3.

51
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,670
this Super Continent Which
they call the World lsland...

52
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,770
..is not only twice as large as
the rest of the World...

53
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,570
.. but also includes 7/8 of
the World's population.

54
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,170
the heart of his World lsland, comprises
eastern Europe and most ofAsia.

55
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,270
this they call the Heart Land.

56
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,670
Which just about coincides With
the old Empire of Djengis Khan.

57
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,670
Hitler's step by step plan for World
conquest can be summarized this Way

58
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,970
Conquer eastern Europe...

59
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,670
.. and you dominate the Heart Land.

60
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,170
Conquer the Heart Land...

61
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,470
.. and you dominate the World lsland.

62
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,370
Conquer the World lsland...

63
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,670
.. and you dominate the World.

64
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,070
that Was the dream in Hitler's mind,
as he stood at Nürnberg.

65
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,070
With page and pageantry the district
leaders from all over Germany...

66
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,370
.. sWore personal allegiance to him,
hypnotized by the belief...

67
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,670
.. that they Were members of
a master race.

68
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,870
this film Will deal With act one
of the Nazi bid for World poWer.

69
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,570
the most fantastic play
in all recorded history.

70
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,170
Hitler had seen Hirohito grab off
Manchuria and other...

71
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,870
.. territories from the Chinese.

72
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,770
He had Watched Mussolini get aWay
With the rape of Ethiopians.

73
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,070
He had seen the democratic World
look the other Way, While...

74
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,470
.. these illegal aggressions
Were going on.

75
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,070
And he smiled.

76
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,070
For collective acts of peace,
the only Weapon he had to fear...

77
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,270
.. had broken doWn.

78
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,570
It Was time noW for the Nazis
to start crossing borders.

79
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,570
It Was time for Hitler to put
his plan into action.

80
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,870
And What Was he Waiting for?

81
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,070
He Was Waiting to soften up his
victims, keep them from uniting.

82
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,670
Demoralize the enemy from Within
by surprise, terror, sabotage...

83
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,970
.. assassination. That is the War
of the future. —Hitler

84
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,970
For his softening up process, he
sent his agents all over the World...

85
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,770
.. disguised as tourists, students
and commercial travelers.

86
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,170
Pay-off men like Ribbentrop came too.

87
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,470
Pay-off men like Ribbentrop came too.

88
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,770
to buy, threaten and form
local fascist parties.

89
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,570
Such as Degrelle and his
Rexist Party in Belgium.

90
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,670
Hagelin in Czechoslovakia.

91
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,970
Seyss-lnquart for the National
Socialists in Austria.

92
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,570
In Britain, Sir OsWald Mosley offered
himself to the people as a Hitler...

93
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,870
.. With a mocks of accents.

94
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,570
In other Words, I'm told that
Hitler is mad.

95
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,970
Well, I've got another theory myself.

96
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,870
Until the day When they Would make
easy, Hitler's actual invasion...

97
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,970
.. these subversive fascist
organizations provoked riots...

98
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,270
. and rebellions creating scenes
like these in France.

99
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,170
Scenes like these in Belgium.

100
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,270
And Where do you think this is?

101
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,270
Right in Madison Square Garden,
U.S.A.

102
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,270
And this is Fritz Kuhn.
Leader of a German/American Bund...

103
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,970
.. hiding behind the American flag
but taking his orders from Berlin...

104
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,770
.. and copying the methods of Berlin.

105
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,470
that Was the softening up
process outside Germany.

106
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,670
But, inside Germany it Was
a different story.

107
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,170
Here, in up-most secrecy,
the hardening up process.

108
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,570
Building up Hitler'sArmy
and his industry

109
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,870
tell the World We have no raW
materials...

110
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,470
.. and never let them see What goes on.

111
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,470
Day after day, night after night,
month after month, year after year.

112
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,070
We must have the World's most
poWerful club.

113
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,070
Forget hours, forget hoW to think.

114
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,470
Forge the club of blood and iron.

115
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,970
And let the Democracies talk about
freedom. No freedom here.

116
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:43,670
No labor unions. No overtime.
the Führer tells you Where to Work.

117
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,670
When to Work. HoW long to Work.
HoW much your Work is Worth.

118
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,470
Forge the club of blood and iron.

119
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,370
We have a sacred mission.
today We rule Germany...

120
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,170
.. tomorroW the World.

121
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,470
For those Who don't like it
you don't eat.

122
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,670
Or you disappear into a
concentration camp.

123
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,870
Or you get this.

124
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,970
And this is the man
Who gives it to you.

125
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,170
And What of the Army?

126
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,270
Before Hitler came into poWer,
the German Army, by treaty...

127
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,270
.. Was limited to 100 thousand men.

128
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,370
But treaties to the Germans, have
alWays been something to ignore.

129
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,070
these 100 thousand men Were, in
reality, 100 thousand...

130
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,970
.. highly trained officers.

131
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,370
the men Who lead the
Nazi regiments today.

132
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,770
But Hitler didn't merely ignore
the treaty, he tore it up.

133
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,670
And in 1935, ordered National
Conscription.

134
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,370
Simultaneously, he ordered German
youth to become air-minded.

135
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,970
toy gliders filled the air.

136
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,170
As the youth greW bigger,
so did the gliders.

137
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,870
Soon these same youths Were trained
pilots, flying neW planes...

138
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,570
.. the factories Were producing.

139
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,670
the Luftwaffe Was being assembled.

140
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,970
the only thing old about this
neW army Was the goosestep.

141
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,370
And even Hitler couldn't improve on
that ancient form of German torture...

142
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,070
.. designed to make man stop
thinking and blindly obey

143
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,270
Goosestep them until they become
an insensible as Weapons.

144
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,570
Everything else Was neW.

145
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,570
tanks, motorized equipment
and one of our oWn inventions.

146
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,570
the dive bomber.

147
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,570
All this rearmament Was strictly
illegal to the Versailles treaty.

148
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,670
And the next illegal step Hitler took...

149
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,570
.. Was to march his troops
into the Rhineland.

150
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,970
A strip of land between Germany
and France, demilitarized...

151
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,370
.. after the last War as a precaution
against future German aggression.

152
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,070
But Hitler's plan of eastern conquest,
demanded a barrier against...

153
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,770
.. democratic action in the West.

154
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,670
So Hitler demilitarized the Rhineland
and began building the...

155
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,570
.. formidable Siegfried Line.

156
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,770
A chain of forts and defenses
450 miles long and in some places...

157
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,570
..30 miles Wide.

158
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:42,370
Germany had fought one, two-front
War and didn't Want another

159
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,670
As many as 1/2 a million men
Worked at least 20 hours a day...

160
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,970
..to build 22 thousand fortified
positions on land...

161
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:06,170
.. Where, by treaty, no German
soldier Was suppose to set foot.

162
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,970
Hitler had his Siegfried Line,
he had his equipment...

163
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,970
.. he had his army.

164
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,670
NoW to unveil the German might,
and terrorize his intended victims...

165
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,170
.. into submission.

166
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,670
General staffs all over the World,
anxiously aWaited the report...

167
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,770
.. of their military attaches.

168
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,070
A Would-be peaceful World learned
that a vast military poWer had...

169
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,170
.. materialized out of noWhere.

170
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,570
A poWer controlled by one man,
Who tore up treaties...

171
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,270
..as We tear up tickertape.

172
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,170
I am Willing to sign anything.
I Will do anything to facilitate...

173
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,870
.. the success of my policy.
Hitler lntervieW October, 1933

174
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,570
Satisfied that they had created
the right sense of fear in the World...

175
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,670
.. the Nazis got ready to strike,
the hour had come.

176
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,170
It Was time to start conquering
eastern Europe...

177
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,570
.. according to the plan of
Hitler's geo-politicians.

178
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,570
It Was time to Win the domination
of the Heart Land.

179
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,070
Who Was the first victim to be?

180
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,870
Naturally, the softest, Austria.
Bite off just enough...

181
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,970
.. not to set the World against you.

182
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,270
On March the 12th, 1938,
Without Warning,

183
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,870
.. the German armies marched over
the Austrian border.

184
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,470
It Was merely only a full-scale invasion
test and Hitler rode in triumph...

185
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,570
.. into Vienna.

186
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,470
Even the very name of Austria
disappeared from the map...

187
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,770
.. though Hitler had promised
earlier to the World:

188
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,070
the assertion that it is the intention
of the German Reich to coerce...

189
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,870
.. theAustrian State is absurd
Adolph Hitler, January 30, 1934

190
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,970
Why Was Austria important to Hitler?

191
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,270
It put him on the southern flank of
Czechoslovakia...

192
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,470
.. and Czechoslovakia Was the key
to the control of eastern Europe.

193
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,470
the German Chancellor Bismarck
explained that years ago When he said...

194
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,370
.. He Who Would conquer Europe, must
first toll the bastions of Bohemia.

195
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,470
And Bohemia Was noW part of
Czechoslovakia.

196
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,370
But Czechoslovakia Was tough.

197
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,170
It had a good army.
It had good equipment.

198
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,170
It had one of the finest
ammunition plants in the World...

199
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,870
.. the Skoda Works, Which Hitler
Wanted very badly.

200
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,470
It had incorrupt able President Benes.

201
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,870
It had a military alliance With France
and France had a military...

202
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,470
.. alliance With Britain.

203
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,770
Find excuses to take Czechoslovakia
one piece at a time.

204
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,770
He found his excuse in the
Sudetenland.

205
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,970
the portion of Czechoslovakia
bordering Germany.

206
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,170
Here lived some people of German
origin, although they had never been...

207
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,470
..a part of Germany itself.

208
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,570
that Was Hitler's cue.

209
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,370
Completely ignoring the fact
that most people Who left Germany..

210
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,470
.. had done so to get aWay
from things like Hitler.

211
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,870
He sprang his pet theory, that
every person of German blood...

212
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,370
..no matter Where he lives,
belongs to the Nazi Reich.

213
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,570
Germans or descendants of Germans.
Often With no more than a drop...

214
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,270
.. of German blood in their veins,
suddenly learned they Were God-like.

215
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,070
Not subject to the land in
Which they live or...

216
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,170
..to Which they oWe their
allegiance...

217
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,870
.. Whether it be Czechoslovakia...

218
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,470
Norway.

219
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,270
SWeden.

220
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,770
China.

221
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,970
the United States ortimbuktu.

222
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,270
According to the Nazis the German Was
a special creature Who Would remain...

223
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:50,170
.. forever German of the 6th and 7th
generation and must take his...

224
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,670
.. orders from Berlin.

225
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,570
Some people We knoW of German
decent think this is a lot of hogWash.

226
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,470
Lieutenant General Walter Krueger

227
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,570
Senator Robert Wagner

228
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,570
Wendell Willkie

229
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,970
Henry J. Kaiser

230
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,770
Including 15%% of any group like this.

231
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,870
But in the Sudetenland he found
some stooges Who fell for this bunk.

232
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,570
Conrad Hemline Was their
bush-league Führer

233
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,570
the people of the Sudetenland Were
told they should be liberated.

234
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,470
they Were told Hitler Was their
liberator.

235
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,870
the Nazi smuggled over their standard
softening-up equipment, blackjacks.

236
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,770
And When the Czechs Were beaten up
trying to combat his 5th Columnists...

237
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,970
.. Hitler screamed the Germans Were
being persecuted and threatened...

238
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,570
.. War, unless he got the Sudetenland.

239
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,670
It is the last territorial claim
I have to make in Europe.

240
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:11,070
I have assured Mr. Chamberlain,
and I repeat it here...

241
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,570
.. that When this problem is solved,
there is for Germany no further...

242
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,670
.. territorial problem in Europe.

243
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,070
We Want no Czechs.

244
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,270
to the League of Nations,
Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov...

245
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,070
.. announced that Russia Was ready
to back...

246
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,970
.. considered action against Germany.

247
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,870
But once again, there Was no
considered action.

248
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,570
the Czechs mobilized and closed
their borders.

249
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,570
the leaders of France and Britain
desperately stride to avoid War...

250
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,970
.. fleW to meet the jubilant
Axis leaders at Munich.

251
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,670
On September 29, in return for
Hitler's guarantee of World peace...

252
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,970
.. Chamberlain and Daladier prevailed
upon Czechoslovakia to give up...

253
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,670
.. the Sudetenland Without a fight.

254
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,770
In Czechoslovakia the Munich Pact
Was greeted by riots of protest.

255
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,170
But Daladier returned to France
to be greeted by cheers...

256
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,970
.. from a relieved French people.

257
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,970
And in Britain, a happy Chamberlain
came back declaring he had...

258
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,770
.. achieved peace, peace in our time.

259
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,870
One of the most tragic and
ironic scenes in all history.

260
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,370
this morning, I had another talk...

261
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:41,070
.. With the German Chancellor Herr
Hitler, and here is the paper...

262
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,170
.. Which bears his name upon it
as Well as mine.

263
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,170
the agreement Was signed last night...

264
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,370
.. and theAnglo-German Naval
Agreement as symbolic...

265
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:03,470
.. of the desire of our two peoples never
to go to War With one another again.

266
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,670
PEACE IN OUR tlME
- Chamberlain

267
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,770
Peace... it Wasn't peace.

268
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,870
the Nazis hadn't nearly dropped
3 million more souls...

269
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,570
.. under the German flag.

270
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,370
By taking the Sudetenland, they had
made Czechoslovakia defenseless.

271
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,170
For in this territory lay
the natural defenses.

272
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,970
the mountain ranges and a
defensive line of forts...

273
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,870
.. considered even stronger
than the Maginot Line.

274
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,270
Without these fortified cautions,
Czechoslovakia Was disarmed.

275
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,370
A ripe plum ready to fall
into Hitler's lap.

276
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,270
Within 6 months of declaring that he
Wanted no more territory anyWhere.

277
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,270
Hitler violated the Munich agreement,
marched in...

278
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,270
.. and took the Whole
of the Czech State.

279
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,570
though he had specifically promised:

280
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,370
I have no further interest in the
Czechoslovakian State, that is...

281
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:06,170
.. guaranteed. We Want no Czechs
Adolph Hitler September 26, 1938

282
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,270
.. guaranteed. We Want no Czechs
Adolph Hitler September 26, 1938

283
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:11,170
Austria and Czechoslovakia
Were gone Without a fight.

284
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,070
And Hitler Was getting his control
of eastern Europe.

285
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,670
Poland Was next on the map.

286
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,770
the tired old men of Munich, noW
kneW, that there could be no peace...

287
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,970
..in our time.

288
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,470
If an attack Were made...

289
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,470
..to change the situation by force...

290
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,770
in such a Way dares to
threaten Polish independence...

291
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,070
.. Why then, that Would inevitably
start a general congregation...

292
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,370
..in Which this country Would be
involved."

293
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,070
But after his success in Munich,
Hitler Was sure...

294
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,970
.. that France and Britain Would not fight.

295
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,170
Here is What one of his spokesman

296
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,570
Democracy has no convictions for
Which people Would be Willing...

297
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,670
to stake their lives."
Dr. Ernst Hanftstaengl

298
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,670
But What about the Russians?

299
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,970
the lights began to burn
all night in MoscoW.

300
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,870
British and French military
missions arrived to confer...

301
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,070
.. With the Soviet government.

302
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,870
So did a German representative.

303
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:23,070
And on August 21, 1939, the World Was
set on its heels by the announcement...

304
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,970
.. of a treaty between the Russians
and the Germans in Which they..

305
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,470
.. agreed not to fight each other

306
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,270
Here Were the admitted arch-enemies
in a state of apparent friendship.

307
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,970
It Was too fantastic to make any
sense... it didn't.

308
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,370
the Germans hoped they could lull
Russia into a false sense of security.

309
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,370
And the Russians needed to prepare
for the fight they kneW Was coming.

310
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,270
they'd read Hitler's book
"Mein Kampf" too...

311
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,470
.. and kneW he had his eyes on
the rich Russian land.

312
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,770
the acquisition of neW soil Was to be
obtained only in the East." Mein Kampf

313
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,070
Confident that Russia Was safely
pigeon-holed, and that the...

314
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,870
.. democracies Would not fight.
the Nazis started singing their...

315
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,070
.. favorite theme song, that all people
of German blood belong to them.

316
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,570
And picked Danzig as their excuse
for the gobbling up of Poland.

317
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,270
Danzig a free city, self-governing
under the League of Nations...

318
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,170
.. Was an important seaport at
the head of the Polish corridor.

319
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,070
Poland's access to the sea.

320
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:34,270
the same old softening process
had gone on here.

321
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,170
Local stooges, armed by Germany,
began to terrorize the city.

322
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,470
Hitler demanded Danzig in
the Polish corridor or else...

323
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,070
.. Poles Will Fight for Danzig

324
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,270
the people of Poland prepared
for the inevitable.

325
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,570
Although they kneW that Britain and
France had guaranteed their borders...

326
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,470
.. they also kneW those countries
Were a long Way off.

327
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,570
Germany's theft of Czechoslovakia had
make Poland's strategic position...

328
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,070
.. even Worse.

329
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:18,070
Carpathian Mountains, Poland is
relatively flat and loW-lying.

330
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,370
the Vistula is the Mississippi of
Poland.

331
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,770
It is broad, muddy and unafordable
for most of its length.

332
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,570
It tributaries are formidable
streams during certain seasons.

333
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,070
But there Was a drought, and the
streams Were so loW during the...

334
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,770
.. campaign that they could be
forded at almost any point, by men...

335
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,370
.. trucks and tanks.

336
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,270
Militarily the Vistula offered
the best line of defense.

337
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,570
HoWever making a stand here
Would have meant surrendering...

338
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,570
.. WarsaW, the richest part
of the country.

339
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,070
the alternative Was to accept
battle on the border.

340
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,070
that Was the Polish decision.

341
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,870
the Nazi plan Was an enormous
pincher movement...

342
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,370
.. aimed at encircling the mass
of the Polish army.

343
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,370
Secondary pincher movement Were
to encircle any Polish groups...

344
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,270
.. Which escaped the main trap.

345
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,970
the last two Weeks in August,
the German armies moved...

346
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,270
toWard the Polish border, Where
they assembled 70 Divisions...

347
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,770
.. many of them armor.

348
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,670
From a military standpoint, the
Poles Were hopelessly outclassed...

349
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,770
..by their predatory neighbor

350
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,870
they managed to mobilize barely
30 Divisions, made up of...

351
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,670
.. infantry or horse cavalry.

352
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,570
In two important respects, the
difference Was staggering.

353
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,570
the Nazis 5000 modern tanks,
Poland 600 non descript tanks.

354
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,070
the German Luftwaffe, 6000 modern
planes...

355
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,270
.. the PolishAir Force, less than
1000 of inferior types.

356
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,570
the German Army secretly made ready.

357
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,770
the Way of living for the next
thousand years Was to be decided.

358
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,870
the fire that had begun in Manchuria...

359
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,470
.. and spread through China and
Ethiopia...

360
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:11,270
.. and Spain Would noW blaze
around the World.

361
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,770
this man made that decision.

362
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,270
War!

363
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,670
Precisely at daWn on
September 1, Without Warning...

364
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,370
.. the German Wehrmacht rolled
over the Polish borders.

365
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,670
Before the invasion Was 30 minutes
old, the planes of the Luftwafe...

366
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,870
.. Were over Poland, Wiping out
the Polish Air Force...

367
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,670
.. most of it caught flat-footed
on the ground.

368
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,770
Most planes that did not get of,
faced overwhelming odds...

369
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,670
.. and Were shot out of the sky

370
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,770
Fire-flying Nazi squadrons ranged
deep into Poland...

371
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,970
.. destroying communications,
radio stations, poWer plants...

372
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,670
highWays, bridges, railroads.

373
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,470
the Polish Army Was disorganized
by the loss of itsAir Force...

374
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,770
.. and the destruction of
communications.

375
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,270
the mass ground unties of the Nazi
Army continued their advance.

376
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,670
Occasionally they unveiled a neW
technique on the arrival of equipment.

377
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,570
For example, advanced units of the
German 4th Army crossed the...

378
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,070
.. Vistula in a neW type of storm boat.

379
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,670
the Polish retreat developed
alarming tendencies...

380
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,670
.. the poWerful German 10thArmy,
Which Was to form the southern claw..

381
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,470
.. of the great Nazi pinchers, Was
advancing With its five armored...

382
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,370
.. divisions on either flank.

383
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,370
On September 6th, the opposing Poles
began splitting into two groups...

384
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,070
.. the southern one falling back
toWard the Vistula...

385
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,170
the armored Divisions on the
German right raced ahead...

386
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,870
.. circling Radome and cutting of this
group, Which finally surrendered.

387
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,170
MeanWhile further north,
the main Polish mass...

388
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,270
.. began drifting toWard Lodz.

389
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,270
the German Command, receiving that
this opened a gate toWard WarsaW...

390
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,370
sent the northern Nazi armored
units racing through the gap...

391
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,070
..to the Polish capital.

392
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,970
the infantry advanced in forced
marches of 35 miles a day...

393
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,770
.. and two days later relieved
the Panzers above WarsaW.

394
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,370
the city Was noW cut off.

395
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,370
West of WarsaW, the main Polish
Armies Were encircled.

396
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,470
Under terrific pressure on the ground,
and pounded coarsely from the air..

397
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,470
.. they began to disintegrate.

398
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,970
they fought on With high personal
courage...

399
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,270
.. but Without airplanes, Without
communications, cut off from...

400
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,370
.. their general staff, the isolated
Polish groups Were forced to surrender...

401
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,370
..one by one.

402
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,170
But WarsaW still resisted.

403
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,670
the heroic strains of the Polonaise,
told an incredulous World...

404
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,470
.. that the people of WarsaW, led by
Mayor Kaczynski, had erected...

405
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,170
..a Wall of courage around their
city defying Hitler's dam nest.

406
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,870
Stopped cold by the city's
desperate resistance...

407
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,470
.. the Nazis Were forced to send
for heavier artillery.

408
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:38,070
the only source of such artillery
Was Germany's Western front.

409
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,070
With great secrecy, the giant 240 mm
haubitzers...

410
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,970
.. Were toWed at high speed across the
highWays, Which Hitler had built...

411
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,570
.. for just such purposes and set
into position around WarsaW.

412
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,570
the huge guns subjected the city to
a bombardment of incredible fury

413
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,570
their fire concentrated on the
densely populated residential areas.

414
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,170
For 20 days of death and horror...

415
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,870
.. every man, Woman and child
fought to save his city.

416
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,370
But Without food or Water,
human endurance fails.

417
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,570
On September the 27th, the strange but
colonialism died on the WarsaW radio...

418
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,670
.. and the Polish capital
Was forced to capitulate.

419
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,470
NoW all Polish resistance Was
at an end, except here...

420
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,170
the Westerplatte port, opposite
Danzig.

421
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,570
this small island of stubborn defiance,
had stood up under the fire of...

422
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,870
.. German Warships from the first day

423
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:24,470
Its guns silenced, its ports shattered,
it still refused to surrender

424
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,570
Even under point blank fire at 800
yards range.

425
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,170
It Was an exhibition of Polish valor
that Will go doWn in history

426
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,370
But militarily it could not avail.

427
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,070
On October 1, the garrison
at last surrendered.

428
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,270
Surrendered to face the fate of these
men.

429
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,570
Polish prisoners being marched of
to massive prison camps.

430
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,270
And eventual extermination.

431
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,170
For the Nazi master race theory calls
for the complete Wiping out of the...

432
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,570
..so-called inferior races.

433
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:07,670
And in village after village, local
Judas's point out loyal Polish neighbors

434
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:18,770
Himmler.

435
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:52,770
these things the Poles can never forget.

436
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,770
Including another one of Hitler's
famous promises:

437
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,970
Germany has concluded a Non-
aggression Pact With Poland.

438
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:06,370
We shall adhere to it unconditionally"
- Adolph Hitler, May 21, 1935

439
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,270
the World noW kneW, that a non-
aggression pact With Hitler...

440
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,470
.. Was the kiss of death.

441
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,470
Poland Was completely destroyed.
Completely?

442
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,170
Not quite. During the last days of the
campaign, the RussianArmy entered...

443
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,770
.. eastern Poland and took up
positions along the Bug River.

444
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:37,270
the two strongest armies in Europe
meet and Hitler could decide now..

445
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,870
.. Whether to keep on heading east
or call it quits.

446
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,670
He called it quits. Why did Hitler
quit here?

447
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,470
He had to!

448
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,370
to continue a drive to the east, Would
leave Germany facing the threat...

449
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,070
.. he'd alWays sWorn to avoid.

450
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,670
A two-front War.

451
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,470
HoW he met that threat, you Will
see in the next film...

452
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,170
.. for Hitler thought impossible,
Was anything but.

453
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,370
the day after Hitler crossed
the Polish border...

454
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,670
France called up her reserves.

455
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,970
Within 24 hours, British planes had
bombed German Warships...

456
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,970
..in the Kiel Canal.

457
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,670
Britain, not merely the British
government...

458
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,670
.. but the British people had declared War

459
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,770
War on Hitler and everything
he stood for.

460
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,570
the Democracies did have convictions
for Which people Were Willing...

461
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,870
..to stake their lives.

462
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,970
Unprepared? Yes.
But that didn't matter

463
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,870
For they finally realized that
What Was being threatened...

464
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:04,770
Wasn't just the integrity of Poland,
but the integrity of free men...

465
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,070
.. everyWhere in the World.

466
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:15,270
What tragedies, What horror,
What crime...

467
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,870
.. has Hitler and all that
Hitler stands for...

468
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,370
.. brought to Europe and the World?"

469
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,870
He did upon this foundation...

470
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,970
.. that Hitler pretends to build
out of hatred...

471
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,570
..a neW order for Europe."

472
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,270
But nothing is more certain...

473
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,770
.. than that every trace of Hitler's
footsteps...

474
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,870
.. every stain of his infected
and corroding fingers...

475
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,170
.. Will be sponged and purged
and if need be blasted...

476
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,270
.. from the surface of the earth."

477
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,470
Lift up your hearts.

478
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,770
All Will come right."

479
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,970
Out of the depths of sorroW and
sacrifice...

480
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,670
.. Will befall again the glory of mankind."

481
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,770
No compromise is possible and the
victory of the democracies can only...

482
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:19,670
..be complete With the utter defeat of the
War machines of Germany and Japan."

483
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,670
G.C. Marshall
Chief of Staff
