00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,441
[Man Voiceover] On this
fifth day of December,

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,218
in the year of our Lord, 1648,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,178
by virtue of the power vested in us

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,930
by our noble sovereign,

6
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:17,058
this tribunal of justice
hereby sentences you,

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,185
the Crimson Executioner,

8
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,477
to death.

9
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,105
You will die by one of
the very instruments

10
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:26,651
you devised to torture and
kill your innocent victims.

11
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:30,071
You dared to take into your own hands

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,949
the laws of both God and man.

13
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,868
You set yourself up as
both judge and executioner.

14
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,955
You caused inhuman suffering

15
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,041
and took like not from
any sense of justice

16
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,377
but from hatred and self-gratification.

17
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,090
(ominous music)

18
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:53,928
You showed no mercy to your victims

19
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,223
and no mercy will be shown to you.

20
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,118
- [Crimson Executioner]
- You'll never kill me.

21
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:01,644
Move along.

22
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,016
- [Crimson Executioner]
- I'll return and be avenged!

23
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,981
Turn around.

24
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,986
[Crimson Executioner] Fools, all of you!

25
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,905
I am the Crimson Executioner!

26
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:15,241
(laughing)

27
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,666
This day shall be written in blood.

28
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,501
No man can judge me.

29
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,295
I am the supreme law!

30
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,380
I shall have my revenge!

31
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,843
(ominous music)

32
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,822
(groaning)

33
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,117
(screaming)

34
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,330
(ominous drumming)

35
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,632
(sizzling)

36
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,148
[Man Voiceover] The
seal of this tribunal

37
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,723
will entomb, forever, both
your body and your evil soul.

38
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,601
Let no man dare to break the seal.

39
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:11,732
You are cursed, eternally
damned, as are these dungeons.

40
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,859
As is this castle that has witnessed

41
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:15,778
such indescribable horrors.

42
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,244
Your castle will stand
throughout the centuries

43
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,663
as a reminder of the barbarism and cruelty

44
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,124
committed within its walls.

45
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,836
May the dust of time not
erase from the memory of man

46
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,880
the infamy of the Crimson Executioner.

47
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,633
(clock ticking)

48
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,477
(ominous music)

49
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,568
(pleasant music)

50
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:52,785
Ah.

51
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:56,165
Not bad. This seems exactly
what we've been looking for.

52
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:56,999
Yeah, from here it looks great.

53
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,000
Just what we need.

54
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:58,918
I think we should be able

55
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:00,878
to wrap up our work here in a day.

56
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,170
This will look good.

57
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,466
[Woman] Come on, Nancy.

58
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,052
[Nancy] Oh gosh, I'm
stiff from that long ride.

59
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:11,971
It's made to order.

60
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,097
Yeah.

61
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:38,999
What a view.

62
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,293
Hey, we don't wanna lose you.

63
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:42,628
Sure looks gloomy.

64
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,200
How would you girls like to have

65
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:45,589
a castle this old to live in?

66
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,300
You'd have to be a creep
to live in a place like this.

67
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,762
I'd love to have a house
like this all to myself.

68
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,058
Imagine the peace and
beauty of living all alone.

69
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,726
You're a funny one, all right.

70
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,063
All right, girls.

71
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,898
Wonder what it looks like inside.

72
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,899
What's wrong?

73
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:06,402
Are you tired?

74
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,014
I don't know what it is, Perry.

75
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,530
I just feel very uneasy.

76
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,822
No.

77
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:11,864
Suzy?

78
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:12,574
Let me alone, Raoul.

79
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,118
Don't be like that, baby.

80
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,512
- Everybody will see us.
- (bell ringing)

81
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,888
- Have it your way.
- (bell ringing)

82
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:17,912
Are you all dead?

83
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,332
Lay any odds you want.

84
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,710
Our dear publisher will wind up saying,

85
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,171
"This place isn't suitable
after all, let's go home."

86
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,191
- [Gray Suited Man]
- Hello? Is everybody out?

87
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,843
If they're all out, how
can anyone be in the house?

88
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:33,846
The brain has spelled it out.

89
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,848
I'm not just a dumb blonde, you know.

90
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,200
[Annie] Who says you're a blonde?

91
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,893
Hello? Why doesn't anybody answer?

92
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,353
Maybe nobody lives here.

93
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,814
What a nuisance.

94
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,108
Someone shoulda told
me the castle's empty.

95
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,069
We might as well try to get in anyway.

96
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,323
Maybe one of the boys
could scale that wall.

97
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:55,409
That's a job for Tarzan.

98
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,061
[Gray Suited Man] Who's gonna
volunteer to climb the wall?

99
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,328
Okay, okay.

100
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,207
Here comes Uncle Perry, the
greatest acrobat in the world.

101
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,049
(laughs) Watch this.

102
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,141
He's a good boy. I
bet he gets us inside.

103
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,559
Yeah, you're right.

104
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,812
Three years for unlawful
breaking and entering.

105
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,411
Take care, Perry.

106
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,215
(sighs)

107
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,426
Mags, you owe me a bonus
for this little stunt.

108
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:57,554
A double whiskey. (Laughs)

109
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:58,889
What about that?

110
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,849
I still think you're playing with fire.

111
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,327
Ah, you should know me by now.

112
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,431
I'm not the kinda man to
let obstacles get in my way.

113
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,729
I'm a man of action.

114
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,733
Well, what do we do now?

115
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:12,069
We follow the leader. What else?

116
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,822
(door creaking)

117
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,697
(laughs) Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the old-

118
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:21,036
- Well done, Perry. Let's go.

119
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,582
(eerie music)

120
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,589
(somber music)

121
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,591
Hey, what a funny place this is.

122
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:18,427
Looks like a Frankenstein film set.

123
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,519
(somber music)

124
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:59,593
Perry, there's something
evil about this castle,

125
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,885
I'm sure of it.

126
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,305
You Hawaiians are far
too impressionable, Kinojo.

127
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,270
Raoul?

128
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:14,815
Raoul?

129
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Raoul?

130
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,201
(gasping)

131
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,453
(ominous music)

132
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,372
(yelling)
(laughing)

133
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,664
You idiot!

134
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,255
Why must you play these
childish jokes all the time?

135
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:37,546
Raoul?

136
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,508
Raoul?

137
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:43,178
Take off that silly costume.

138
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,137
(gasping)

139
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,890
(ominous music)

140
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,024
These uninhabited castles

141
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,239
always have their family skeleton.

142
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,198
Uninhabited?

143
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,284
There's not a trace of dust around here.

144
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,289
Who are you? What're you doing here?

145
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,832
I'm very sorry.

146
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,251
Nobody answered the doorbell

147
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,128
and we thought the castle was empty.

148
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,507
Could we speak to the owner?

149
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,095
I'd like a word with him
about a business matter.

150
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,014
Could you take us to him?

151
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,306
Follow me.

152
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,850
Let's go.

153
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,992
The rest of you wait in there.

154
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:52,914
[Man] Stop where you are!

155
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:56,043
How dare you force your way
into my castle like this.

156
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,044
What do you want here?

157
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,378
I want to apologize.

158
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,470
We didn't think anyone
lived here, that's all.

159
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,799
[Man] It's no excuse for trespassing.

160
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,635
I don't like having my privacy disturbed.

161
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:06,927
I'm sorry, sir.

162
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,013
You're quite right.

163
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,390
My name is Parks.

164
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,059
I'd like to explain.

165
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,031
We've been scouting for suitable locations

166
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,744
to photograph material for book jackets.

167
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,064
I'm a publisher.

168
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,274
That's no concern of mine.

169
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,526
Look here, I'd like to
show you one of my books.

170
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,215
I'm preparing an anthology of horror-

171
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,238
- He told you to stay where you were.

172
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,090
We took the liberty of coming in here

173
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,160
only because no one answered
our knocking at the door.

174
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,704
I don't like intrusion.

175
00:14:32,996 --> 00:14:35,832
I insist that you leave
my castle immediately.

176
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,251
Could you make just one exception?

177
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,796
We've been on the road for several days.

178
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,339
Everybody's so tired.

179
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,174
I don't want any visitors here.

180
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,593
I'd be only too glad to pay, of course.

181
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,427
Pay?

182
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,638
Now you're beginning
to annoy me, Mr. Parks!

183
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,307
(somber music)

184
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,906
I know my friend
didn't mean to offend you

185
00:14:58,021 --> 00:14:59,272
and we ask you to forgive us.

186
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,943
(somber music)

187
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,072
(foreboding music)

188
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,537
You and your practical jokes.

189
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:16,998
Raoul.

190
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,668
(upbeat music)

191
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,811
Hey!

192
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,454
On your feet, everybody!

193
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:56,764
We've been old to shove off.

194
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:59,624
The master of the house doesn't
like having visitors around.

195
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,251
What? Again?

196
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,210
Oh no.

197
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:04,838
Not after all I went
through to get you in here.

198
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,607
So we're right back where we started.

199
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,884
One castle's too modern, one's too old.

200
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,344
Why don't we build our
own and get it over with?

201
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:15,474
Suzy, wouldn't it cost an
awful lot of money to build one?

202
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh, can't you change his mind?

203
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,435
We're all tired.

204
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,562
Well, I'm tired too.

205
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:23,148
But we have no choice.

206
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,025
We've been told to go and that's it.

207
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,444
Let's get moving quickly.

208
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Edith!

209
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,492
Wait!

210
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,288
Perhaps I was a little
too hasty, Mr. Parks.

211
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,415
I'm not usually so inhospitable.

212
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,959
I realize you must all be very tired.

213
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:45,879
You see, I don't usually receive people.

214
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,672
You can stay here overnight.

215
00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:49,192
But I'll have to ask you to leave

216
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,467
first thing in the morning.

217
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,759
Thank you, sir.

218
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,554
We really do appreciate
your kind hospitality.

219
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,515
Do you mind if we take a few pictures?

220
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:57,933
All right.

221
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,559
But please remember,

222
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:01,394
I don't like to be disturbed.

223
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:03,897
My servants will show you

224
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,400
the chambers where you can do your work.

225
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,132
Perfect! Let's get to work, girls!

226
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,317
We mustn't waste any time!

227
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,571
Go and change quickly.

228
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,799
Dermott, you better check
out the setting we need.

229
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:14,983
Edith, you go along with him.

230
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,235
- Good girl.
- Come on, Edith.

231
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,486
Don't go near the dungeons.

232
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,542
They're absolutely out
of bounds for everybody.

233
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:20,704
Okay, we won't.

234
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,499
Get moving, Dermott, we're in a hurry.

235
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:30,465
(creaking)

236
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:39,224
I'll bet Max'll flip over this one.

237
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,560
Can you imagine finding
a thing like this here

238
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:42,477
that wasn't a (indistinct)?

239
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,369
I'll take credit for that, I found it.

240
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,521
Yeah.

241
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:46,605
Food for everybody.

242
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,735
Hey Max, I want a bonus
for finding this thing.

243
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,027
All right, we'll see
about the bonuses. Now eat-

244
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,613
- It would be perfect
for the Skeletrix series.

245
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:54,531
Hey, that looks great.

246
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,583
Fine boys, fine, but now
let's get to work.

247
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:58,660
I'll take the food to the girls, right?

248
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,704
No, I'll take care of that one myself.

249
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:13,675
What a picture this'll make!

250
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,344
(somber music)

251
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,250
(throat clearing)

252
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:48,084
- (gasping)
- Max!

253
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,753
Why don't you ever knock?

254
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,547
Come on, now what's all this nonsense?

255
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,091
I'm just like a father to you girls.

256
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:57,969
[Nancy] Turn around, we
have to get into our costumes.

257
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,388
Okay, have your little
games but hurry up.

258
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,080
We haven't any time to fool around.

259
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:03,391
We've got work to do.

260
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,063
You can turn around now, if you want.

261
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,275
Edith, bring the girls downstairs.

262
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,319
We can't afford to waste any time.

263
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,611
All right.

264
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:25,747
How's the food?

265
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,581
Terrible.

266
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:27,873
As usual.

267
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,295
Bottle of wine they call
it. It tastes like water.

268
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:33,838
Yeah, it's awful, isn't it?

269
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,840
But I know where we can find real wine.

270
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,443
I discovered where the cellar is.

271
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,467
Come on, I'll show you.

272
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,346
See ya. Come on, Perry.

273
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,563
(eerie music)

274
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,594
You know, Perry,

275
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,013
I wouldn't mind being
the owner of this castle.

276
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,100
You can have it. It gives me the creeps.

277
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,592
Skeletons don't have nerves.

278
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,603
What do you mean, it gives you the creeps?

279
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:35,358
(eerie music)

280
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:08,098
(gasping)

281
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:10,268
(clanking)

282
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:18,318
(shushing) You'll wake up the ghosts.

283
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,653
Come on.

284
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:21,945
This way.

285
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:27,118
(eerie music)

286
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,444
(foreboding music)

287
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,955
Now don't breathe. Perfect, like that.

288
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,549
All right, hold the pose.
I wanna take another shot.

289
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,521
Edith, hand me the other camera, will you?

290
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:29,931
Thanks. Now don't move, darling.

291
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,476
Hold it. You make a
beautiful corpse, you do.

292
00:22:33,768 --> 00:22:35,436
Just keep it. That's right.

293
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:39,065
(pleasant ukelele music)

294
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,357
Perfect.

295
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,821
- It's no fun being dead.
- Nobody ever said it was.

296
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,823
- You mean it?
- You were very convincing.

297
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,115
Okay guys, come on.

298
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:48,783
Just imagine what Daddy will say

299
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,493
when he sees this photo.

300
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:52,036
- Go and change now.
- Yeah.

301
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:55,123
Okay, Susie it's your turn now.

302
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,644
Sure, here I am, but where's Perry?

303
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,669
He's in it too.

304
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,047
Here I am, your personal skeleton.

305
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:05,550
Always ready to die at
the hands of a beautiful woman.

306
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,012
How are you going to change?
Annie's first.

307
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,698
You're never around when you're needed.

308
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,599
Right, but look what I dug up for you.

309
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,123
Rick, can I have your knife a minute?

310
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,609
Thanks.

311
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:35,914
What is it?

312
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:37,874
Just a little homesick, I guess.

313
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:46,841
Are you all asleep over there?

314
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,218
Get behind that camera, Dermott.

315
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,053
(upbeat whimsical music)

316
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,425
Here's a pistol, Dermott.

317
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,153
Come on now.

318
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,739
No, it's too heavy anyway.

319
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,075
Let's try a long sword, huh?

320
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,786
It's light as a feather,
sweetheart, let me show you.

321
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,628
What's wrong with it?

322
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,048
I can't unsheath it. It must be rusty.

323
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,844
Don't just stand there looking, help me.

324
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:36,307
Let's pull together. Pull, pull pull.

325
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,868
Forget it, we don't need it out.

326
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,692
Okay I want you to
hold it aloft menacingly,

327
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:42,164
it's not heavy, you can lift
it without much effort at all.

328
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:45,191
Watch. Like this.

329
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,909
(grunts) Give me a hand, will you?

330
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,251
Well, you do it, Annie.

331
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,004
You've got the general
idea now, haven't you?

332
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,590
(upbeat music)

333
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,699
(laughing)

334
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,247
(silly music)

335
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,599
Come on, sweetie.

336
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,978
(silly music)

337
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,058
Hold it.

338
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,938
(silly music)

339
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,149
Hmm, now let me see what we can do here.

340
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,988
Yeah, that's a possibility.

341
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,493
Put your head down.

342
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,374
Lower, right on the block.

343
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,376
Haven't you ever been beheaded before?

344
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,462
These actors...

345
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,675
Put your arms down. That's more like it.

346
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:20,179
That's cool, stay there.

347
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,014
Now then, give me the axe.

348
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,280
Really these actors.

349
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,368
(silly music)

350
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Hold it.

351
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,457
Now Nancy, honey, give
me the feeling of a cat.

352
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,749
You know what I mean.

353
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:50,877
Meow.

354
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:51,794
Meow.

355
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:53,171
(hissing)

356
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,088
Meow.

357
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,133
No, Nancy, that's too domesticated.

358
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,343
I want you to think wild, fierce.

359
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:00,803
Meow!

360
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:02,346
Meow.

361
00:28:02,638 --> 00:28:03,723
Meow!

362
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,725
Can't you think like an alley cat?

363
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,894
For instance, you're
about to fight another cat

364
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,687
for a fish head or something.

365
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:10,979
Meow.

366
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,499
No! No, Nancy, that's
the intellectual approach!

367
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:13,683
You'll never be an alley cat.

368
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:14,817
Let's try something else.

369
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:16,109
I've got an idea.

370
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,362
There, now raise your leg up.

371
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:19,654
Up! Up!

372
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,698
Ow.

373
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,117
That's it.

374
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,495
Now, imagine you're floating in the air

375
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:28,247
like a thistle blown by the wind.

376
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:29,539
That's it, beautiful.

377
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,709
No, not like that.

378
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,127
You've got to go up.

379
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:35,421
Gently, that's right, baby.

380
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,797
Now hold it. No!

381
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:38,841
Can't you keep that arm over you head?

382
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:39,675
Now everything's in place.

383
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:41,469
Arm, leg, head, everything.

384
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:44,597
Now don't move.

385
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,227
Come on, Nancy, get that
lovely foot of yours up.

386
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:51,771
Like a feather, like a
thistle blown by the wind.

387
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,314
No, I can't.

388
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,649
It's too heavy.

389
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:56,733
I can't.

390
00:28:56,859 --> 00:28:57,859
Do it for me, baby.

391
00:28:57,985 --> 00:28:59,946
Let's fly together, hold it.

392
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,789
What are you writing?

393
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,372
The start of another one
of those murder mysteries

394
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,501
my readers love.

395
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,053
This is one of yours too?

396
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,388
Yes, of course.

397
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,025
You know you're my favorite writer?

398
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:39,317
Say, thanks!

399
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,697
(soft romantic music)

400
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:54,083
Rick, I could fall in
love with a man like you.

401
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,757
You're a swell guy. I
could, I really mean it.

402
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,295
You're a sweet girl, Nancy,

403
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,763
but you deserve something
better than a man like me.

404
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,730
- May I have this, Rick?
- Sure. Why not?

405
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:20,526
Go ahead without me, there's
something I wanna look into.

406
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,155
Okay, we'll set up the
next shot in the meantime.

407
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,033
Camera about here.

408
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,706
There.

409
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:37,251
Dermott, can we take a
break for a few minutes?

410
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,146
No, we've gotta be
finished before morning.

411
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,880
Put the spots over there.

412
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,172
Okay.

413
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,084
[Guard] What're you doing here?

414
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,617
[Edith] I'd like to see
the owner of the house.

415
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:53,184
It's not possible.

416
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,911
My master doesn't want to be disturbed.

417
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:56,535
- But tell him-
- I said it's impossible.

418
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,329
Your master has a right to his privacy

419
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:01,108
but that's no way to speak to a lady.

420
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Rick.

421
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:10,201
You met the owner of the
house. What's he like?

422
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,636
It's difficult to say, really.

423
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,204
He was half hidden behind a table.

424
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:15,706
Have you noticed the windows?

425
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:17,375
They're all barred.

426
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:20,628
What a strange place.

427
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,839
If I was still a reporter,
I bet I could discover

428
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,175
a lot of interesting
facts about this castle.

429
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:30,930
Rick, why are you wasting
your time on horror stories?

430
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,058
You should be doing the kind
of work you were cut out for.

431
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,351
Reporting.

432
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,120
I guess you're right
but I'm a little lazy.

433
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:39,146
I've been taking the easy
way out by doing this.

434
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:40,838
I started out with the usual dreams

435
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:42,303
and found out there's more money

436
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,360
in writing this kind of commercial book.

437
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,406
Edith, I realize I'm being indiscreet

438
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:51,117
but why did you want to speak
to the owner of the castle?

439
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,410
Just curiosity.

440
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,703
Nothing more than that.

441
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,501
Everything's ready, Dermott, can I go?

442
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,978
Not more than a few minutes, though.

443
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:02,586
Time's running short.

444
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:03,421
You bet.

445
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:04,255
Come on, Suzy.

446
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,214
Don't pull me like that.

447
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,048
Come on.

448
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,882
But where?

449
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:07,800
Oh, come on.

450
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,092
Okay, I'm all set.

451
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,761
Everybody out of the way.

452
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,053
That's right.

453
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,390
Hold that pose, Perry.

454
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,976
Don't move. I'll be done in a minute.

455
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,228
Now, here we go.

456
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,229
(gasping)

457
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,731
Perry!

458
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,023
(screaming)

459
00:32:24,066 --> 00:32:25,066
Oh no!

460
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:29,071
(eerie music)

461
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,950
Oh my God.

462
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,255
I seemed to know as soon as we arrived

463
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,923
that this was a place of evil.

464
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:52,219
And Perry laughed and said
that I was being emotional.

465
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:01,061
Raoul, didn't you hear that yell?

466
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:01,896
I didn't hear anything at all.

467
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:02,730
Come along.

468
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,062
Where are you taking me?

469
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,315
You'll find out.

470
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:10,946
Look at that.

471
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:12,573
What is it?

472
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,865
I don't know.

473
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,659
Maybe it was an old torture cell.

474
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,077
You know these old castles.

475
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,205
Nothing in it.

476
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,376
Let me alone, Raoul, I'm scared.

477
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:26,377
Suzy.

478
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,381
Suzy.

479
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:32,885
(somber saxophone music)

480
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,786
Come, Kinojo.

481
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:01,956
Staying here won't help any.

482
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,248
Come with me.

483
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,254
There's no point in
disturbing my master.

484
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,882
He's been informed already of
what has happened down here

485
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:15,427
and he hopes that you
will all remain calm.

486
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,555
The rope was badly worn, Rick.

487
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:19,086
We overlooked that, I'm afraid.

488
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,641
What're you gonna do now?

489
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,685
I don't know.

490
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,106
We'll see.

491
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,745
Remember Rick, even
the master of the house

492
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,280
suggested that we keep calm.

493
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,715
Tomorrow we notify the police.

494
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,365
What do you mean tomorrow?

495
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,410
Listen, after all it
was only an accident.

496
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,037
A tragic one, but an accident.

497
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:43,914
And besides, it's too late now.

498
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,292
Look Max, this double
talk leaves me cold.

499
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,584
What do you really mean?

500
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:53,757
- Well, I'm an editor.
- You've got to see my point.

501
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,094
I've a deadline to meet.

502
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:20,117
I know exactly how you feel, girls.

503
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,703
But we must finish our
work before daybreak.

504
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,288
With poor Perry lying dead?

505
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,623
Oh, it's a big tragedy.

506
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:27,499
You know Perry was like a son to me.

507
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,002
Don't you think I have a
heart, like the rest of you?

508
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,294
How do I know?

509
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:33,964
I never had a chance to see it.

510
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,592
Perry would've known what I meant.

511
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,344
Yeah but he's dead

512
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,012
and I wanna go on living.

513
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,641
I'll double your salary.

514
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:46,101
[Kinojo] My life's worth more than that.

515
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:47,102
Triple it.

516
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:48,103
[Kinojo] Okay, it's a deal.

517
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,395
[Nancy] Me too.

518
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:50,814
Then let's get back to work.

519
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,025
Where's Suzy?

520
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,693
I think she went off with Raoul.

521
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:55,653
That's just like her.

522
00:35:55,944 --> 00:35:57,905
They always disappear at the wrong moment.

523
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:01,116
We'll worry about her later,
let's go back to work now.

524
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,536
Well I thought I'd seen
just about everything.

525
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:07,748
But this kind of bargaining is
really more than I can stand.

526
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,625
Rick, look at this.

527
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,917
What is it?

528
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,131
It's the negative of
the photograph I took

529
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:17,925
right when the accident occurred.

530
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,178
Poor Perry.

531
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,470
What a terrible thing.

532
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,473
What's this?

533
00:36:26,558 --> 00:36:29,186
What's that strange shadow
near the frame of the door?

534
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,357
It almost looks like a man's head.

535
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,649
Yes, it does.

536
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,569
That's exactly what I thought.

537
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,197
But it just can't be.

538
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,951
Still, it does look like a man's head

539
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,243
with a hood on.

540
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,789
(somber music)

541
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,670
(gasping)

542
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,089
(menacing music)

543
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,675
(eerie music)

544
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,102
(groaning)

545
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,394
No!

546
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:14,732
(eerie music)

547
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,460
No! No!

548
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,466
(whimpering)

549
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:42,675
No!

550
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,972
(menacing music)

551
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,691
(water sloshing)

552
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,779
[Rick] Will it show up
more clearly on the print?

553
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,070
It should.

554
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:05,365
We'll see in a minute.

555
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,702
I've done the best I could.

556
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,997
Of course, it's only a small detail.

557
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:17,376
There.

558
00:38:18,378 --> 00:38:20,881
This is the maximum
enlargement I can make here.

559
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,259
Of course, it's still not very clear.

560
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,346
Hmm.

561
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,807
This doesn't help us
very much, I'm afraid.

562
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:32,267
It's hardly at all visible.

563
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,895
You think the negative
coulda been defective?

564
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:35,729
No, it was perfect.

565
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,141
May I see that photograph?

566
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,700
I heard about the accident
that took place tonight.

567
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,410
A most appalling accident.

568
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,706
Unfortunately it's blurred.

569
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,667
Yeah, it was out of focus.

570
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,586
Perhaps this will sound strange

571
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,548
but I have something to tell you

572
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,164
that may provide an explanation

573
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,010
of the shadow in your photograph.

574
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:10,639
Have you ever heard of
the Crimson Executioner?

575
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:14,059
Who did you say?

576
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:15,477
The Crimson Executioner?

577
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:16,969
He was a maniac and a killer

578
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:19,565
who was put to death for
his crimes centuries ago.

579
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,483
He was buried in his own castle.

580
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,735
What you don't know is
that this is the castle

581
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,530
where the Crimson
Executioner lived and died.

582
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,116
When I came here the castle

583
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,493
had been uninhabited for centuries.

584
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:35,038
For me it was ideal
because I desired solitude.

585
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,251
Everybody else feared the curse
that had been placed on it.

586
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,703
When they sealed up his tomb,

587
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:43,589
the Crimson Executioner swore
that he would avenge himself.

588
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,550
He was a man of extraordinary
physical strength,

589
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,471
obsessed by an ideal of purity.

590
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:53,432
For centuries he was entombed,

591
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,934
there in the dungeons,

592
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:58,270
and only a seal has protected mankind

593
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,022
from his supernatural powers.

594
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:06,194
If the shadow in the photograph
is the Crimson Executioner,

595
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:08,655
I fear anything might happen.

596
00:40:08,947 --> 00:40:10,365
I had to tell you.

597
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,951
(eerie music)

598
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,214
Well, I can see you two
already know each other.

599
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:27,799
I've never had the pleasure.

600
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,928
This is the first time
I've seen this lady.

601
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:34,723
(clock dinging)

602
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:37,893
I must retire now.

603
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,354
I'm a creature of habit.

604
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,023
I hope you will sleep well.

605
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:46,692
Goodnight.

606
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:57,204
Edith, I know the accident upset you.

607
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,830
You're terribly tired.

608
00:40:59,122 --> 00:41:01,083
What happened was a
very bad shock for you.

609
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,001
You stop crying now.

610
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,761
Now, she's been through
more than the rest of us.

611
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,312
(ominous music)

612
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,403
(girls giggling)

613
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,042
Do you think it's too daring?

614
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,086
No, I bet Max will like it.

615
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,378
He always does.

616
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,592
Hi girls. Has Suzy come back yet?

617
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,678
No, maybe we should go on without her.

618
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,970
She'll be along.

619
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,601
You'll make a big hit
in that costume, Annie.

620
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:03,478
Won't I too?

621
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,050
Oh no, what's gotten into you?

622
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,357
You mustn't hide those
beautiful legs of yours.

623
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,079
They desecrated your world of beauty

624
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,666
with their sordidness.

625
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,335
The day of the Crimson
Executioner has now come!

626
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:33,467
I've been wondering about
the owner of this castle.

627
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,862
If you want my opinion, I
think he's slightly off his nut.

628
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,046
You would be too if you
lived isolated in this place.

629
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,598
You'd end up the same way he is.

630
00:42:40,932 --> 00:42:41,975
(chuckling)

631
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:42,809
Hey, Dermott.

632
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:43,810
Yeah?

633
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:45,102
Look at this.

634
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,030
This must be where the
Executioner was killed

635
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,815
if the legend is true.

636
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:50,107
What is it?

637
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,192
Looks like a coffin.

638
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:53,612
No, it was a medieval
instrument of torture.

639
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,322
The infamous iron maiden.

640
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,039
(groaning)

641
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,331
Suzy!

642
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,833
What?

643
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,669
(menacing music)

644
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,766
No one can dare say that
this was a accident.

645
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:27,853
Come on.

646
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,483
(ominous music)

647
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:50,335
Just as I thought.

648
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:51,962
The rope wasn't worn.

649
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,254
It was cut.

650
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:58,468
At this point there's
only one explanation.

651
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,928
Deliberate murder.

652
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:02,389
Deliberate murder?

653
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,016
But why, Rick?

654
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:06,348
It doesn't make any sense.

655
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:08,895
That's what we've got to find out.

656
00:44:09,187 --> 00:44:10,730
Any idea where Raoul is?

657
00:44:11,022 --> 00:44:11,565
Raoul?

658
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,776
No, no, I don't mean he
had anything to do with this.

659
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:17,362
But perhaps he saw who did it.

660
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:20,031
He was near Suzy all the time.

661
00:44:20,323 --> 00:44:21,658
Here, take this.

662
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,150
My car is the fastest we have.

663
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:25,787
Go to the nearest police
station and try and get help.

664
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,789
Okay, Rick, I will.

665
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:28,748
But how about you?

666
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,835
What're you going to do, stay here?

667
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:34,719
With a murderer at large,
we're all in danger.

668
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,149
I know but it's impossible to leave

669
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,192
with things as they are and
we've got to find Raoul,

670
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:39,235
he might have some evidence.

671
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,427
I'll be as fast as I can.

672
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,225
(ominous music)

673
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,114
How much longer do we have to wait now?

674
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,492
We get paid, why should you care?

675
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,958
You get prettier by the minute, girls.

676
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,294
Take a look at this,
Max. I have a new idea.

677
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:17,589
I don't want the girls to know this yet.

678
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,423
Suzy's been murdered.

679
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,257
What's that?

680
00:45:19,549 --> 00:45:21,051
So you like the idea?

681
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,761
Sure, it's great.

682
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:23,595
You better watch out.

683
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,698
Dermott's already on his
way to the police station.

684
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,264
Don't tell the girls.

685
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:27,140
They'd only get panicked.

686
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:28,659
But then Perry was killed too.

687
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:30,185
We completely agree then?

688
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,186
Well, what do we do now?

689
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,812
I'll have a look around.

690
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:34,522
You better stay with the girls.

691
00:45:34,814 --> 00:45:35,814
See you later.

692
00:45:41,112 --> 00:45:43,698
(ominous music)

693
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:09,015
What are you doing here?

694
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:10,618
I wanna see your master right away.

695
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,786
No, he doesn't want to see anybody.

696
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,829
It's urgent that I see him
no matter what, understand?

697
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:14,933
I said you can't see him.

698
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:17,607
(ominous music)

699
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,574
Edith, what're you doing here?

700
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,245
I want you to see what I found.

701
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,668
I'm sure you recognize her.

702
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,421
What's your portrait
doing in this castle?

703
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,256
Then you do know the owner.

704
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,842
Yes, Travis and I were engaged.

705
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:44,676
Travis Anderson.

706
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,137
Isn't he the actor who
disappeared several years ago?

707
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,391
Yes, he used to be a
muscle man in costume films.

708
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,185
It all happened so
suddenly, so unexpectedly.

709
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,395
He left without a word.

710
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,064
He just vanished.

711
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:00,525
He's always been a little strange.

712
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:03,403
Even with me, he seemed so cold.

713
00:47:04,654 --> 00:47:07,198
Yet I'm certain that he really loved me.

714
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,951
In all this time I
haven't stopped wondering

715
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:11,953
why he disappeared like that.

716
00:47:13,371 --> 00:47:15,248
Now I've found him here in this castle.

717
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,820
I thought I recognized his voice

718
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,252
and now that I've found
this I know it's Travis.

719
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:20,920
I must try to speak to him.

720
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:23,256
Edith, we have no time for that.

721
00:47:23,548 --> 00:47:24,758
You've got to trust me.

722
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:25,592
[Edith] What is it?

723
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,884
I'll tell you later.

724
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,594
Where's Kinojo?

725
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:30,678
I left her downstairs
when I went to find Travis.

726
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,058
There's not a moment to
lose, we must find her.

727
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:33,975
What's happened, Rick?

728
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:35,685
Don't ask any questions, hurry!

729
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:39,721
We've got to reach the others.

730
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:41,274
It's important we all stay together.

731
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:42,150
But what's going on?

732
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,361
I don't understand.

733
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:45,653
(Kinojo moaning)

734
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:46,945
Kinojo?

735
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,117
(Kinojo moaning)

736
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,039
(ominous music)

737
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:58,874
Kinojo!

738
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,794
Kinojo!

739
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:02,961
(whimpering)

740
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,046
Watch out, Rick!

741
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:11,096
Don't try to get any closer
to me, you'll get killed.

742
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,306
There's no escape for me, I know it.

743
00:48:13,598 --> 00:48:16,017
You must save yourselves while
there's still a chance.

744
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,686
Don't you see?

745
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,189
It's a diabolical trap.

746
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:24,275
It's impossible for anyone to reach me.

747
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,153
These wires are connected
to the bows on the walls.

748
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:29,125
The slightest touch
will release the arrows

749
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,117
in every direction and
anyone nearby will be killed.

750
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,956
Nobody can stop the mechanism
that operates the spider.

751
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,874
It has poison in its claws.

752
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,878
I'll be killed the moment it reaches me.

753
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,882
(eerie music)

754
00:48:48,174 --> 00:48:49,467
No, it's hopeless!

755
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,763
Watch out, Rick.

756
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:55,515
Don't do it, Rick!

757
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,143
You'll be killed!

758
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,980
(Kinojo whimpering)

759
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,566
(eerie music)

760
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,202
I tell you, it's hopeless.

761
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:17,787
Don't do it, Rick.

762
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,079
Leave me, it's no use.

763
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,542
(ominous music)

764
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,677
Please don't come any closer.

765
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,388
You're mad to risk your life like this.

766
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,224
(Kinojo sobbing)

767
00:50:10,798 --> 00:50:11,798
Rick!

768
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,011
(eerie music)

769
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:39,202
(Kinojo whimpering)

770
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:45,415
No!

771
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,008
[Edith] Rick, your jacket's caught!

772
00:50:57,303 --> 00:50:59,722
(eerie music)

773
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,450
(Kinojo whimpering)

774
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:30,211
It's all over for me.

775
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,215
It's the end for all of us.

776
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:36,718
(whimpering)

777
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,725
(eerie music)

778
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,528
Give up Rick, it's no use.

779
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,820
It's too late.

780
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,282
Rick!

781
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,915
(whimpering)

782
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,136
(Kinojo screaming)

783
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:24,682
(ominous music)

784
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,439
Kinojo!

785
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,068
Kinojo!

786
00:52:38,946 --> 00:52:39,946
Oh, Kinojo.

787
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,616
What a horrible death.

788
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,102
I've gotta get her down from here.

789
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,703
Edith, go find the others.

790
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:46,537
Hurry up!

791
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:48,581
You've gotta get out
of the castle at once!

792
00:52:48,873 --> 00:52:49,916
At once!

793
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,334
No, Rick, no!

794
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,710
Not without you!

795
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:54,002
Do what I tell you!

796
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,758
Go away, Edith, go away!

797
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,593
Don't worry about me!

798
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,929
Dermott will be back here
soon with the police.

799
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:10,853
(motor buzzing)

800
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,468
Open the door!

801
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,471
Let us out! Let us out!

802
00:53:45,763 --> 00:53:47,306
It's no use. We've been locked in.

803
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:48,598
No! What do we do?

804
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,850
Max!

805
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:50,476
Max, what's happening?

806
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:51,853
Where are the others?

807
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,896
I don't know but don't lose your head.

808
00:53:54,188 --> 00:53:56,190
Just come on down here.

809
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:57,793
Go and tell Rick that we need him.

810
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,817
All right.

811
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,820
We have to get out of here.

812
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,871
Rick!

813
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,348
Rick, all the doors are locked!

814
00:54:11,372 --> 00:54:12,372
We can't get out!

815
00:54:12,498 --> 00:54:14,178
Keep calm, Edith, we'll make it somehow.

816
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,459
Just a minute.

817
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,421
(Edith whimpering)

818
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,049
(Edith moaning)

819
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,187
(whooshing)

820
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,479
Edith?

821
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:39,442
Edith?

822
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,778
(thudding)

823
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:46,407
(ominous music)

824
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,886
Travis!

825
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,348
Don't come any nearer.

826
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,640
Don't touch me.

827
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,770
You are the murderer.

828
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,732
Now I know it, Travis.

829
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:23,443
How could you?

830
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,362
You're a monster!

831
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:27,615
(groaning)

832
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,160
You!

833
00:55:31,452 --> 00:55:33,204
You no longer mean anything to me.

834
00:55:34,163 --> 00:55:36,916
Even though I missed you
when I abandoned the world.

835
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:46,133
I was forced to retreat to this castle.

836
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,264
Mankind is made up of inferior creatures,

837
00:55:52,598 --> 00:55:55,226
spiritually and physically deformed,

838
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,521
who would've corrupted the
harmony of my perfect body.

839
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,990
(ominous music)

840
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,646
I came to the isolation of this castle

841
00:56:41,647 --> 00:56:45,192
to avoid the contagion of human sentiment.

842
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,407
And a woman's love

843
00:56:58,497 --> 00:56:59,498
would've destroyed me.

844
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
It's because of that.

845
00:57:12,845 --> 00:57:13,845
I abandoned you.

846
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,308
Travis, you've lost your sanity.

847
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,310
You're an egotist,

848
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,854
obsessed with your sick thoughts.

849
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:23,146
You're wrong, Edith.

850
00:57:24,148 --> 00:57:26,734
Last night I had a moment
of weakness because of you,

851
00:57:30,571 --> 00:57:32,114
when I first caught sight of you

852
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,664
and I said you could stay
together with your friends.

853
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:42,083
But that was a mistake!

854
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:50,967
I know of only one who is
never overcome by weakness.

855
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,428
The Crimson Executioner.

856
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:56,764
He despised your world.

857
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,308
(eerie music)

858
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,394
As passionately as I do.

859
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:02,979
Look at him.

860
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,270
Look at him.

861
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,822
His magnificent body
was preserved, intact,

862
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,491
through all these centuries undisturbed.

863
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,205
His spirit lives in me

864
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:23,708
and I'll continue his
mission of vengeance.

865
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:27,878
This is the sacred duty I've sworn to.

866
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,046
We're alike.

867
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:33,592
(eerie music)

868
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:40,266
Now that you have profaned his tomb

869
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:45,646
and broken the seal that
imprisoned his great spirit,

870
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,608
his power has been released at last.

871
00:58:55,322 --> 00:58:59,994
And his noble crusade against
sin lives again through me!

872
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:13,174
Yes, the black fire of the long
awaited vengeance is here.

873
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:20,097
And your friends cannot escape.

874
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:26,270
The Crimson Executioner
has passed judgment.

875
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:28,856
(eerie music)

876
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,033
And now,

877
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,119
at last,

878
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:46,415
you'll witness the glory of his return!

879
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,339
And you'll pay just like the others.

880
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,841
(whimpering)

881
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:05,017
Travis!

882
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:06,352
Don't do it!

883
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,644
Come back!

884
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,777
(ominous music)

885
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,459
(suspenseful music)

886
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,865
Now you'll be punished for your lechery.

887
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:15,296
The Crimson Executioner will torture you.

888
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,756
Yes, will torture you!

889
01:01:20,467 --> 01:01:21,467
Till death!

890
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:26,891
(menacing music)

891
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:32,938
(girls whimpering and screaming)

892
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,361
(ominous music)

893
01:03:35,477 --> 01:03:38,731
That's just a small portion of
the torture that awaits you.

894
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:46,280
I promise you that none
will escape the wrath

895
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,868
of the Crimson Executioner!

896
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,165
(ominous music)

897
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:03,088
As for Rick!

898
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,551
This is how he will die.

899
01:04:07,843 --> 01:04:09,011
Why are you doing this?

900
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,305
Why don't you let us go?

901
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:14,558
What have we done to you?

902
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:21,773
(metal clinking)

903
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,442
You're torturing innocent people!

904
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,152
Come back to your senses!

905
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:28,530
You're the owner of this castle.

906
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:31,241
Not the Crimson Executioner.

907
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:33,619
(yelling)

908
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,911
You'll see.

909
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:38,207
I am the Crimson Executioner!

910
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,922
(wood creaking)

911
01:05:27,714 --> 01:05:28,714
Raoul!

912
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:34,179
(wood creaking)

913
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,398
(groaning)

914
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,988
(wood creaking)

915
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:05,669
(wood creaking)

916
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,738
(sighing)

917
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:54,653
[Nancy] I can't stand
it anymore! Let me go!

918
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:58,282
The Crimson Executioner
invented the torture of icy water

919
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:00,492
for creatures like you.

920
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,169
(whimpering)

921
01:08:14,464 --> 01:08:16,758
(ominous music)

922
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,094
(groaning)

923
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:21,972
My vengeance needs blood.

924
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:31,189
The Crimson Executioner
cries out for blood!

925
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:34,318
(groaning)

926
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,828
(yelling)

927
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,628
(screaming)

928
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,798
You better prepare to die.

929
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:58,090
You sinner!

930
01:08:59,926 --> 01:09:02,179
(screaming)

931
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:16,151
(menacing music)

932
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,071
(Travis laughing)

933
01:09:35,128 --> 01:09:37,297
(groaning)

934
01:09:41,718 --> 01:09:44,930
(suspenseful music)

935
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:55,774
(thudding)

936
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:58,860
(suspenseful music)

937
01:10:36,022 --> 01:10:38,066
(moaning)

938
01:10:38,358 --> 01:10:40,402
(thudding)

939
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,142
(gagging)

940
01:11:58,104 --> 01:11:59,397
Rick!

941
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:01,024
Rick!

942
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:04,236
(suspenseful music)

943
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,571
(crashing)

944
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:13,370
(groaning)

945
01:12:15,413 --> 01:12:17,499
(gasping)

946
01:12:24,422 --> 01:12:25,422
Rick!

947
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:32,888
Edith.

948
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:35,600
Where are you?

949
01:12:35,892 --> 01:12:37,352
You mustn't worry about me.

950
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:39,563
I'm not in danger.

951
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,274
Try to find the others if you can, Rick.

952
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:44,526
They're in Anderson's hands.

953
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:45,978
He took them to the dungeons.

954
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:47,237
He's insane.

955
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,239
He thinks he's the Crimson Executioner.

956
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,532
You've got to stop him

957
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,284
or he'll kill them all!

958
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:54,119
Hurry, Rick!

959
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,996
[Rick] Yes but where are you, Edith?

960
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:56,997
[Edith] Watch out!

961
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:59,332
(clinking)

962
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,796
(suspenseful music)

963
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,523
(clinking)

964
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,319
(gasping)

965
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,284
(eerie music)

966
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:03,772
I'm not through with you yet.

967
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,941
What more do you want with me?

968
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:06,858
You're insane!

969
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,985
You can't get away with this.

970
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:12,197
Let me out of here, I'll
pay you anything you want.

971
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,698
What're you going to do now?

972
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,702
This fire will purify
your miserable soul!

973
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,329
You're impure!

974
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,247
This fire will cleanse you!

975
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:22,082
No!

976
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,708
You can't do this to me!

977
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,710
Stop! Stop!

978
01:14:26,002 --> 01:14:27,002
Stop!

979
01:14:27,128 --> 01:14:28,588
No, I don't wanna die like this.

980
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,923
No, let me out!

981
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:34,344
[Travis] Burn, fire, burn!

982
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,846
(whimpering)

983
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:41,643
(yelling)

984
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:45,689
Mercy!

985
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,108
(screaming)

986
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:54,906
(eerie music)

987
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:11,715
(gasping)

988
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,467
(ominous music)

989
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:36,656
(screaming)

990
01:15:36,948 --> 01:15:37,948
Your new lover!

991
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,535
There he is, the lover of death!

992
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:42,704
Embrace this poisonous man!

993
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:44,456
Go on, he's waiting!

994
01:15:47,959 --> 01:15:50,962
(footsteps thumping)

995
01:16:36,257 --> 01:16:37,550
The lover of death!

996
01:16:37,842 --> 01:16:38,551
No, I don't wanna die!

997
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:39,552
Embrace him!

998
01:16:39,844 --> 01:16:40,844
No! No!

999
01:16:41,012 --> 01:16:42,012
Embrace him!

1000
01:16:42,972 --> 01:16:43,972
No!

1001
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:44,808
Why do you resist?

1002
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,893
Annie! Run! Run!

1003
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:49,312
(screaming)

1004
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:51,396
Annie!

1005
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:56,236
(suspenseful music)

1006
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:03,076
No!

1007
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:04,368
No!

1008
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:05,452
Let me go!

1009
01:17:06,329 --> 01:17:07,413
Let me go!

1010
01:17:07,705 --> 01:17:08,706
No!

1011
01:17:08,998 --> 01:17:09,707
No!

1012
01:17:09,999 --> 01:17:12,127
(screaming)

1013
01:18:06,472 --> 01:18:08,099
Now it's your turn!

1014
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:09,100
Travis!

1015
01:18:09,392 --> 01:18:10,392
You'll pay too!

1016
01:18:10,643 --> 01:18:11,643
No! No!

1017
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:14,355
(whimpering)

1018
01:18:14,647 --> 01:18:15,899
Let me go!

1019
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,191
Stop!

1020
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:18,984
Let me go!

1021
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:21,529
Travis, don't!

1022
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:22,821
Don't!

1023
01:18:23,072 --> 01:18:24,199
Oh please, stop!

1024
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:26,533
Please let me go!

1025
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,829
(sobbing)

1026
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,415
You're mad!

1027
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:35,168
(ominous music)

1028
01:18:36,961 --> 01:18:37,961
No! No!

1029
01:18:41,716 --> 01:18:43,635
Don't do this to me!

1030
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:46,221
(eerie music)

1031
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:59,275
Travis! Travis!

1032
01:19:01,444 --> 01:19:03,321
The Executioner has risen from his tomb.

1033
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:05,031
Your atonement has just begun.

1034
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:10,620
(eerie music)

1035
01:19:12,413 --> 01:19:14,082
It's done. I killed the writer.

1036
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:15,959
Ah!

1037
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,335
It's not true.

1038
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:19,212
No, it's impossible!

1039
01:19:20,546 --> 01:19:21,546
No!

1040
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:22,966
They'll all die!

1041
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,636
(screaming)

1042
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,930
No, I can't stand this!

1043
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:30,807
No, I beg you, Travis!

1044
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,309
What're doing is insane!

1045
01:19:33,601 --> 01:19:34,310
Stop it!

1046
01:19:34,602 --> 01:19:36,729
(screaming)

1047
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:41,525
Oh my God!

1048
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:44,279
The Crimson Executioner

1049
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:46,864
(eerie music)

1050
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:49,909
No! Go away!

1051
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:53,162
I am the Crimson Executioner!

1052
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,466
[Edith] Rick!

1053
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:09,095
It's impossible!

1054
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:10,387
It can't be!

1055
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,682
It's impossible that
he's alive, I tell you!

1056
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,517
I killed him myself!

1057
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:15,809
I saw him die!

1058
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,186
It wasn't me you murdered.

1059
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:19,314
You hit the dead body of poor Raoul.

1060
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:20,765
I put his corpse on the tower

1061
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,180
and that's what your arrow hit.

1062
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:24,569
You'll have to try again.

1063
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:25,861
Kill him!

1064
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:28,156
Go on!

1065
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,741
Go on!

1066
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,284
Kill him, I said!

1067
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:34,370
(suspenseful music)

1068
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:41,711
(groaning)

1069
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:46,799
(gasping)

1070
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:07,278
(chains rattling)

1071
01:21:08,571 --> 01:21:11,491
(suspenseful music)

1072
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,499
(groaning)

1073
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,273
(gagging)

1074
01:21:51,697 --> 01:21:53,116
Watch out, Rick!

1075
01:21:58,287 --> 01:22:01,666
(chains rattling)

1076
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,001
(thudding)

1077
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,179
(suspenseful music)

1078
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,531
(banging)

1079
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:05,062
(whip cracking)

1080
01:23:05,354 --> 01:23:07,565
(whimpering)

1081
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:14,447
(gagging)

1082
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:16,991
(eerie music)

1083
01:23:45,561 --> 01:23:46,896
My perfect body

1084
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:54,195
in the poisonous clutches
of the lover of death.

1085
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:02,995
(ominous music)

1086
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,208
Edith!

1087
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:09,334
Rick!

1088
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,261
My body.

1089
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,721
My pure body...

1090
01:24:21,013 --> 01:24:23,057
(groaning)

1091
01:24:27,186 --> 01:24:28,938
Has been contaminated.

1092
01:24:30,481 --> 01:24:32,316
The body of the Crimson.

1093
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:35,652
Executioner.

1094
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:39,865
(eerie screaming)

1095
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,748
Edith.

1096
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,960
(somber music)

1097
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,252
He was completely mad.

1098
01:24:53,796 --> 01:24:55,423
Like the Crimson Executioner,

1099
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:58,092
Travis was obsessed with
the dream of absolute purity

1100
01:24:58,384 --> 01:24:59,427
and physical perfection.

1101
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:03,431
That's why he retired to the
isolation of this castle.

1102
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:07,059
Our intrusion into his
world was too much for him

1103
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:09,371
and it was then that he assumed

1104
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,772
the identity of the Crimson Executioner

1105
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,775
and decided to carry out the
ancient legend of revenge.

1106
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:18,487
His striking resemblance
to the real the executioner

1107
01:25:18,779 --> 01:25:21,324
made it easy from him to
believe his own hallucination.

1108
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:24,368
Striking resemblance?

1109
01:25:27,913 --> 01:25:30,458
Anderson in his folly created
the legendary executioner

1110
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,585
in his own image.

1111
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:36,797
The Crimson Executioner has
been dust for centuries.

1112
01:25:37,089 --> 01:25:38,424
It was terrible.

1113
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,635
Please take me away from this castle.

1114
01:25:40,926 --> 01:25:42,637
It was a nightmare.

1115
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:44,930
I won't write any more horror stories.

1116
01:25:45,222 --> 01:25:47,224
The man that said life
is stranger than fiction

1117
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:48,517
made no mistake.

1118
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:53,064
(ominous music)

1119
01:25:57,234 --> 01:25:59,654
(eerie music)
