00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:38,811
Tanaka.

3
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:39,644
Ho!

4
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:40,477
- Iuanaga.
- Here.

5
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,310
- Fugimoto.
- Yo!

6
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,143
- Mishi.
- Here!

7
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,010
- Uanaga!
- Here.

8
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,180
- Ataya!
- Yo!

9
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,193
- Sashi!
- Here!

10
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:46,026
- Olihamo!
- Yo!

11
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,467
- Komoto!
- Here!

12
00:02:58,418 --> 00:02:59,251
- Kanakas.

13
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,393
The ones from Hawaii.

14
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,034
You know what they call us Mainlanders?

15
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,250
Kotonks.

16
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,653
The way they tell it,
if you rap on our heads,

17
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,720
it's like hitting a coconut.

18
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,037
Hollow heads, you know.

19
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:09,954
Kotonk, kotonk, kotonk.

20
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,743
Look where
you're going, will ya?

21
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,920
- 90 day wonder.

22
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,070
Still got the original
shine on those bars.

23
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,130
- Lieutenant Grayson to see the adjutant.

24
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,963
- He's not in, sir.

25
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,938
The colonel said he'd see you himself.

26
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
- Thank you.

27
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,200
- You can go right in, sir.

28
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,033
- Thank you.

29
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,080
Lieutenant Grayson reports for duty, sir.

30
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,913
At ease, lieutenant.

31
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:12,810
Welcome to Camp Shelby.

32
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,900
- Thank you, sir.

33
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,440
- This your first assignment since

34
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,650
receiving your commission?

35
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,810
- Yes, sir.

36
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,080
- Well, lieutenant, it's a rough one.

37
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,130
The platoon you're taking over

38
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,520
is just ready to start training,

39
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,610
and as you may have noticed,

40
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,410
our facilities are not
all that they might be.

41
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,300
We're short of officers,
short of equipment,

42
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,000
short of everything except trainees,

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,150
and they're coming in by the carload.

44
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,120
This is a brand-new outfit.

45
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
A new kind of outfit.

46
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,650
No precedent for it except one battalion

47
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,930
that was activated in Hawaii

48
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,170
and they haven't been tested yet.

49
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,537
What do you think of the idea, lieutenant?

50
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,920
- Well, sir, I'd like to make a request.

51
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,037
What is it?

52
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,440
- I'd like your permission, sir,

53
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,390
to put in for a transfer
to the 36th Division.

54
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,928
You see, sir, I'm from Texas—

55
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,370
- What has that got to do with it?

56
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,210
- Nothing, sir, except that the 36th

57
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,370
is an old Texas National Guard outfit,

58
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,640
and I've been in it ever
since I got in the Army.

59
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,160
That is, until they sent me to OCS.

60
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,820
I never would have gone if I'd thought.

61
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,250
Sir, I just took it for granted

62
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,460
that I'd go back to the 36th.

63
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,790
- You're sure that's the only reason

64
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,800
you have for wanting a transfer?

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,190
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,790
- No objection to working with the kind

67
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,440
of troops we have here?

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,720
- Because they're Japs?

69
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,553
Oh, no, sir.

70
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,740
Nothing like that at all.

71
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,633
- Now, let's get a couple of
things straight, lieutenant.

72
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,270
First, there's not gonna be any transfer.

73
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,103
You're staying here.

74
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,489
Have you got that?

75
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:30,840
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,420
- Second, they're not Japs.

77
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,620
They're Japanese Americans.

78
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,343
Nisei or, as they call
themselves, buddhaheads.

79
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,650
All kinds of buddhaheads, lieutenant.

80
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,010
From Hawaii, Alaska, California,

81
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,020
New York, Colorado.

82
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,290
Yes, and even some from Texas.

83
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,730
They're all American citizens,
and they're all volunteers.

84
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,160
Remember that.

85
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,530
And another thing.

86
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,130
We officers are referred
to as haoles not white men.

87
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,740
Any questions?

88
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,320
- No, sir.

89
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,602
- Report to your company commander.

90
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:01,620
The sergeant major will show
you to his orderly room.

91
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,467
That'll be all, lieutenant.

92
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,980
- Sorry to keep you waiting, lieutenant.

93
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,930
- Oh, Captain Solari.

94
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,803
- That's right.

95
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,407
That's our regimental slogan.

96
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:30,590
- "Go for broke"?

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,280
- It's Pidgin English for shoot the works.

98
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,402
Pull up a chair, lieutenant.

99
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,235
- Nice.

100
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,847
- I'll be with you in a minute.

101
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,410
- Tell me, sir,

102
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,710
do you use live ammunition
in the rifle range?

103
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,010
- A Jap's a Jap, eh?

104
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,100
- All I know is they were
put under armed guard

105
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
in relocation centers last year.

106
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,280
Maybe the Army just had
some surplus barbed wire

107
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,160
they wanted to use up, was that it?

108
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,640
- The Army was facing an emergency

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,890
at the start of the war.

110
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,770
A possible invasion by Japanese troops.

111
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,080
So all Japanese Americans were evacuated

112
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,410
from the West Coast.

113
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,740
There was no loyalty check,
no screening, nothing.

114
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,010
If there were any spies among them,

115
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,430
I can assure you they're not in the 442.

116
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,490
Every man in this outfit
has been investigated,

117
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,823
reinvestigated, and re-reinvestigated.

118
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,720
Now, I suggest you start
getting acquainted.

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,850
Your platoon sergeant's
over in the supply room.

120
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,913
Ohhara.

121
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,490
- Ohhara!

122
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,323
- That's right.

123
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,156
Takashi Ohhara.

124
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,657
- Hey, wait a minute.

125
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:46,228
Come back here.

126
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,626
How long you been in the Army, soldier?

127
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,280
- Let me see now.

128
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,230
Maybe I been inside, two, three months.

129
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,149
How long you been inside, lieutenant?

130
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,360
- Don't you know you're
supposed to hold your salute

131
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,135
till an officer returns it?

132
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,107
- Oh, sure.

133
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,581
Sometime forget.

134
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,720
"Sometime forget"
to say sir, too, don't ya?

135
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,860
- Sometime.

136
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,070
Well, don't forget it anymore.

137
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,903
- No, sir.

138
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,070
- That's your own uniform?

139
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,520
Sir, that's
the smallest size he got,

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,260
the supply sergeant, Sir.

141
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,860
- Well, roll those sleeves down.

142
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,773
- I hold salute, sir.

143
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,710
- Why are you wearing leggings

144
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,780
with a class A uniform?

145
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,600
- To keep my pants up, sir.

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,163
Long like that.

147
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,140
- Well, get 'em cut down.

148
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,680
- Oh, yes, sir.

149
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,780
Payday I'll go see the tailor, sir.

150
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,110
- You'd better see somebody today

151
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,583
before I see you again.

152
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,713
All right, men.

153
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:51,263
All I wanna see is backbones and elbows.

154
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,642
- Come on.

155
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,520
And he made it.

156
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,420
Little Phoebe.

157
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,470
Pretty little Phoebe.

158
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,620
Watch that stuff, huh?

159
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,970
Get your money down, suckers.

160
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,900
It all rides.

161
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,733
Go for broke.

162
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,160
- Gee, break 'em up, break 'em up!

163
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,720
New lieutenant outside.

164
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,043
Must be the one for us.

165
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,350
Oh, boy.

166
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,112
Eight feet tall and mean like anything.

167
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,920
Number-one manini kind.

168
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,670
Chicken.

169
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,010
- Well, the honeymoon's over.

170
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,492
- Mix me up.

171
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,325
All Nisei outfit.

172
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:27,580
How come haole officers?

173
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,710
- That's just to make us
a little more miserable.

174
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,450
First, they pick out the crummiest camp

175
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,660
in the United States.

176
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,810
- Why'd you ever enlist?

177
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,130
That's what I wanna know.

178
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,963
- Why?

179
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,200
Because a wise guy college man like you

180
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,470
snowed me under with a lot of fancy talk.

181
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,420
You guys from relocation centers.

182
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,970
Okay, you probably got it better here.

183
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,660
But me, I was on the outside.

184
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,750
Iowa.

185
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,049
A free man knocking off 500 bucks a month.

186
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,520
- 500 bucks?

187
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,773
No.

188
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,470
- 500 buck, yeah.

189
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,530
Chick sexing.

190
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,980
I can look at a day-old chick

191
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,664
and tell you if it's a he or a she.

192
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,980
- Now, who'd want to know
that except another chick?

193
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,210
- You pay for the poultry feed

194
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,330
and you'd wanna know.

195
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,770
A he ain't no good at
all when it grows up.

196
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,290
Only the shes.

197
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,130
- How come chicken farmers
no can find out themselves?

198
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,550
Too bashful?

199
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,320
- You funny man.

200
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,820
Chick sexing is a science.

201
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,130
It was developed in Japan,

202
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,180
and it's one field where
buddhahead gets a break.

203
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,830
Mean to say ya never heard of it?

204
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,740
- I just got as far as
the birds and the bees.

205
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,847
- These college guys are
sharp, you know that?

206
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,260
Four years at USC and he's a bonafide,

207
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,620
recognized fruit peddler.

208
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,510
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,853
A fruit peddler with
an architect's degree.

210
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,200
- I could have got a job as

211
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,650
an architect if I kept trying.

212
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,800
- Well, why didn't you?

213
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,880
- It's just my eyes.

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Couldn't handle all that close work.

215
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,427
- Yeah, eye trouble, that's what it was.

216
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:53,310
All you need is corrective glasses

217
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,730
to take the slant out of your eyes.

218
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,352
- Ah, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick,

219
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,916
chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.

220
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,749
- Hey, kotonk.

221
00:10:58,749 --> 00:10:59,780
Take it easy, huh?

222
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,613
Huh, Chick?

223
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,150
- Come on, get it down.

224
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,280
Buck and a half.

225
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,113
One more, one more.

226
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:07,030
- Boy, oh, boy!

227
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,750
You one lucky kotonk.

228
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,050
Wish I got packages like that.

229
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,003
- You and me both.

230
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,930
- You send package?

231
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,733
- Yeah, hand me those cans, will you?

232
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,703
- Where you gonna send?

233
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,800
Brother in the Army in Pacific?

234
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,633
- Uh-uh.

235
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,967
Family in a relocation camp in Arizona.

236
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,040
Arizona, U.S.A.

237
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,433
You think that chow here is bad, brother.

238
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,853
- You can even get soap?

239
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:31,686
- Oh, sure.

240
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,070
They've got a canteen loaded with stuff.

241
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,940
Anything you want,

242
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,420
if you can get there
before they're sold out.

243
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,943
Yes, sir, all the comforts of home.

244
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,910
And only one block from the barracks

245
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,928
to the toilets and showers.

246
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:43,761
- Barracks?

247
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,100
Everybody all thrown together?

248
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
- Got partitions.

249
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,120
Separate room for each family.

250
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,953
My folks are lucky.

251
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:52,490
Only five of them since I left.

252
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,830
- Treat you like that,

253
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,990
hard to figure why a guy
volunteer for the Army.

254
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,000
- We have to do something,

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,040
so we never get a deal like that again.

256
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,390
- We show 'em.

257
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,790
We show 'em us buddhaheads
good soldiers, good Americans.

258
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,140
- That's the idea.

259
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,238
I hope it works.

260
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:10,880
- Sure it works.

261
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,710
Already a lot of stuff in
newspapers about the 442.

262
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,443
- Yeah, all we need now is casualty lists.

263
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,850
Gee, that's a pretty girl.

264
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,683
What her name?

265
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:25,516
- Terry.

266
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:26,349
- Terry.

267
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,840
Nice name.

268
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,673
Your wife?

269
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:30,010
- Not yet.

270
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,277
Why you wait?

271
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,750
- This is a great time to be
starting a family, isn't it?

272
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,330
You kotonks, funny guys.

273
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,393
Boy, if I had a girl like that,

274
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,920
they gotta draft me.

275
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,560
No volunteer.

276
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,343
No, sir, draft me and drag me away.

277
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:46,820
- Once more, once more.

278
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,830
Go for broke!

279
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,586
Once more, that's all I ask.

280
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:50,958
That's all!

281
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:51,791
Seven!

282
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,276
- Let me see those dice!

283
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,276
- Attention!

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,320
- At ease.

285
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,670
- Men, this is Lieutenant
Grayson, our platoon leader.

286
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,720
- Pick up that money.

287
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:26,610
Pick it up.

288
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,443
- Yes, sir.

289
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,290
- Donation for the company fund, sergeant.

290
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,640
Give it to Sergeant Ohhara.

291
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
Can he do that?

292
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,520
It's my money.

293
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,130
- I want that man's name, sergeant.

294
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,840
There's no talking after
the command at ease.

295
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,673
- Yes, sir.

296
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:40,780
- This man, no dog tags,

297
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,360
needs haircut, window unwashed,

298
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,750
uniforms hanging wrong way.

299
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,300
Haircut, shave, bunk
out of line, dog tags,

300
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,990
window, beer can on shelf,

301
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,250
dirty floor, dirty boots,

302
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,311
haircut, window,

303
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,750
bowl of milk on floor.

304
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,440
Bowl stolen from mess hall.

305
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,580
Brought cat into barracks.

306
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,540
Floor, boots, dog tag, haircut.

307
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,020
Dust on rafters, window,

308
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,740
haircut, dog tags, boots,

309
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,690
bunk out of line,

310
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,153
litter on floor, boots.

311
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,060
Forget the book, sergeant.

312
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,090
They're all on the list.

313
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,680
You men will fall out for a speed hike

314
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,100
at eight o'clock tonight.

315
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,470
Before that I want this hutment GI'd.

316
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,670
Get them started on it
right away, sergeant.

317
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,190
Floors scrubbed, rafters dusted,

318
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,240
windows washed, boots shined, bunks made.

319
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,070
I want those blankets stretched so tight

320
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,530
that when you drop a quarter
on them it'll bounce.

321
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,120
I'll be back twice a day from now on

322
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,220
with a pair of white gloves and a quarter.

323
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,960
- You're a chicken expert.

324
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,803

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,421

- I didn't hear anything, sir.

336
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:24,212
- What does that mean?

337
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,045
- Sorry, sir.

338
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,180
I don't speak Japanese.

339
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,410
- Boots, dog tag, window,

340
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,373
dust on rafters, floor, boots.

341
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,988
Boots, floor, boots.

342
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:54,408
Blankets not tight enough.

343
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,358
Shirt unbuttoned, boots, window, floor.

344
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,739
All right, up and over!

345
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,760
Go back and try it again!

346
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,203
I'm gonna wait right here
till everybody makes it.

347
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:59,708
Hey,
you guys, beat it, quick!

348
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,850
- In combat, anything goes.

349
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,320
That's why we teach you dirty tactics.

350
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,210
I will now demonstrate
a grip against which

351
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,123
there is absolutely no defense.

352
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,173
The sergeant will now try to get free.

353
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,490
Well, sergeant?

354
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,790
- You want me to try, sir?

355
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:26,556
- Of course I want you to try.

356
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:27,973
- Very well, sir.

357
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,364
- Eyes right!

358
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:52,860
Eyes front!

359
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:56,271
Eyes right!

360
00:17:58,858 --> 00:17:59,775
Eyes front!

361
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,463
Eyes right!

362
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:14,624
Eyes front!

363
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,433
Eyes right!

364
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:32,821
Eyes front!

365
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:40,896
Eyes right!

366
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,610
- That was the kiss of death, brother,

367
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,490
the kiss of death.

368
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,490
- Yeah, the big brass figures were ripe.

369
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,360
I can smell that salt air already.

370
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,210
- Take another sniff, will ya,

371
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,150
and see if it's the Pacific.

372
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,247
- Yeah, that's what I'm sweating out.

373
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,343
- You and me both.

374
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,080
- Nobody wanna go Pacific but me.

375
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,720
Well, I keep trying.

376
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,470
Every time they ask for volunteers—

377
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,880
- Tommy, you have to
speak perfect Japanese.

378
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,200
It's for combat
intelligence, interpreters.

379
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,827
They don't want buddhahead
riflemen in the Pacific.

380
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:17,670
- Why?

381
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,210
- Look, Tommy, a million
guys fighting an enemy

382
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,610
that looks like us.

383
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,820
What if a GI sniper spots you or me?

384
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,930
- He see uniform.

385
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,930
- Yeah, and probably figure we're spies.

386
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,393
- Sam, I tell you something.

387
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,040
I don't like talk about it,

388
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,190
but I'm gonna tell you.

389
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,810
Pearl Harbor day the planes they come.

390
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,640
You can only read it.

391
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,493
I can see it.

392
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,650
Pretty soon, I go volunteer
for the 100th Battalion.

393
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,483
Too young.

394
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,143
By the 442 come up, I volunteer again.

395
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,153
Too small.

396
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,640
Next time, I stand on
my toes a little bit.

397
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,683
Okay, I'm in.

398
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,350
They send us Europe.

399
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,573
Sure, I go and fight.

400
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,750
More better do I fight

401
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,000
the ones who bomb the islands.

402
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,190
- It's the same enemy, Tommy.

403
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,233
- Maybe for you.

404
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:10,163
Pearl Harbor day, two people
visit friends near Honolulu.

405
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,263
They both been killed.

406
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,893
My mother, Sam.

407
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,498
My father.

408
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,056
Mail call!

409
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,532
Guchizaki.

410
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:25,970
- Right here, right here!

411
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,385
- Hey, this is from my brother
in the 100th Battalion!

412
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,468
Nawaguchi.

413
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,710
- Mail call, Tommy.
- Come on, hurry up!

414
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,571
You go.

415
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,071
No mail for Tommy.

416
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,033
- Come on, close it up, close it up.

417
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,735
- Here's the list, lieutenant.

418
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,404
- Thanks, captain.

419
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,210
Nagashook, Shooki.

420
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,043
William J.

421
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:23,876
- Nishigoka.

422
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,209
Leonard S.

423
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,364
- Uchigakiuchi.

424
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:28,410
- Uchigakiuchi.

425
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,243
Harry.

426
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:30,076
- Ikagani.

427
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:30,909
Joseph T.

428
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:31,904
- Kamakura.

429
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,500
Sam W.

430
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,417
- Toyotomi.

431
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,260
- Toyotomi.

432
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,255
- Tomatsu.

433
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,620
Guchizaki.

434
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,154
- Satoshi.

435
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:41,575
- Shimabukarotenshugi.

436
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,001
- Shima...

437
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,040
- Shimabukarotenshugi.

438
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,873
- Shima—

439
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:47,130
George W.

440
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,555
- Thanks.

441
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,388
Fugimoto.

442
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,303
Thomas H.

443
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,440
- Any scuttlebutt on where
this scow is taking us?

444
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,933
- I was just gonna ask you, lieutenant.

Hey, Sam, how you know so sure

450
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,363
we're going to England?

451
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,380
- Because that's where the line forms

452
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,387
for the invasion of France.

453
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:42,040
And it's coming off any day now.

454
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,720
- That's us, shock troops.

455
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,140
Just in time.

456
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,020
They used up the 100th
Battalion at Cassino.

457
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,510
- But anyway, it won't be the Pacific.

458
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,343
- How do you know?

459
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:51,536
You ever hear of the Panama Canal?

460
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,800
- Hey, Sam, what you think?

461
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Maybe so, huh?

462
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,580
- Well, if it's the Pacific,

463
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,870
we've been sailing three
days in the wrong direction.

464
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,880
- The navigator don't know.

465
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,020
Nobody knows.

466
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,293
Drives you nuts.

467
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,723
Oh, I'll get it.

468
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:08,033
- Thank you, lieutenant.

469
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,040
For 20
years the Italian people

470
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,920
have been fed on bunk.

471
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,610
Their propagandists declared
that all of our people

472
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,030
look upon Italians with contempt,

473
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,310
regarding them as a race of hand organ men

474
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,990
and banana peddlers.

475
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,670
We know that such statements are lies.

476
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,160
Racial prejudice is abhorrent

477
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,636
to our American concept of democracy.

478
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,670
Naples with its old world
history, majestic Vesuvius,

479
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,570
the Castle of St. Elmo,

480
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,440
the famous churches,

481
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,840
the magnificent harbor,

482
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
second to none in all the world.

483
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,060
These and many other historic sights

484
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,960
are of interest to the soldier.

485
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,060
Take advantage of this opportunity.

486
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,990
See as much as you can.

487
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,960
You've got a great chance to do now,

488
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
major expenses paid, what would cost you

489
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,860
a lot of your own money after the war.

490
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,800
You'll want to poke around in quaint,

491
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,230
out-of-the way places

492
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,800
and the only way to do that is to walk.

493
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,930
Be sure to allow plenty of time in Naples

494
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,770
so you can take it all in
at a nice leisurely pace.

495
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,520
Start your promenade at the harbor.

496
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,684
The Italian practice is
to have a siesta hour

497
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,793
sometime between one and four
o'clock in the afternoon.

498
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,440
If this custom remains in vogue
during occupational period,

499
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,100
you'll save time and patience

500
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,883
by confining your shopping to other hours.

501
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:21,633
Mama, Mama,

502
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,270
- Come on, come on, don't hog it all.

503
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,683
- Let's go!

504
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,800
Off your seat and on your feet!

505
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,960
Continuing our
tour of picturesque Italy,

506
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,700
we come to the Via Casilina,

507
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,293
which leads directly to Rome.

508
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,040
The districts around
Rome are full of places

509
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,520
of historical interests,

510
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,573
and transportation is excellent.

511
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:02,638
Take a break!

512
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:03,471
Take 10!

513
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,130
- Everybody rides but the buddhaheads.

514
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:25,356
- That's the 100th Battalion!

515
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,098
Masami!

516
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:31,556
Hey, Masami!

517
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,755
- Hi, you paisan!

518
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:34,588
- My brother.

519
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:35,421
Him okay?

520
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,254
- Not even a scratch.

521
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:37,970
He's a few trucks back!

522
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,003
Hey, haven't got an extra
top string, have you?

523
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,120
- I don't think so.

524
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,953
Where you going?

525
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:44,660
- Same place as you, paisan.

526
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,740
Haven't you heard?

527
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,180
We been attached to the 442.

528
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,670
One big, happy family!

529
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,820
- No kidding!

530
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,653
Ride on, boy.

531
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:51,597
Here, top string!

532
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,353
- What was that?

533
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,850
- I said very sorry.

534
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,683
Sorry, sir.

535
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,140
Within easy reach of Rome,

536
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,460
are the medieval towns of Tuscany,

537
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,640
sleepy little villages,

538
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,637
scarcely touched by the
march of civilization.

539
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,193
Take 10!

540
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,843
- Hello, Joe.

541
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,733
- No, but I'd like to learn.

542
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,013
The door open?

543
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,560
The door, the door.

544
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
- It's open, lieutenant.

545
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,200
- The lady is gonna mend this for me.

546
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,800
Call me when the word
comes down to move out.

547
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,842
- Yes, sir.

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,603
- Maybe.

553
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,260
- Yeah, I just got a
feeling the lieutenant's

554
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,883
gonna take care of us.

555
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,185
- Break's over!

556
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,240
Let's go!

557
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,040
All right, on your feet!

558
00:29:44,122 --> 00:29:44,955
- Lieutenant Grayson.

559
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:46,230
I forgot to tell him we're moving out.

560
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,424
- Holy mackerel.

561
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:48,303
- What'll I do?

562
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,303
Close it up!

563
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,390
Come again,

564
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,630
- Friend.

565
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,810
- No, I don't know him.

566
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,311
Your friend, huh?

567
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:52,269
Smith.

568
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,667
John Smith.

569
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,417
Capitano, John Smith.

570
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,280
- Glad to meet ya, sir.

571
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,380
Don't tell me where you got
that good-conduct ribbon.

572
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,097
Let me guess.

573
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,526
How about some more vino, huh?

574
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,273
Darling.

575
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,663
- That's my old outfit!

576
00:31:34,663 --> 00:31:35,496
Where did you get this?

577
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:36,390
Who gave it to you?

578
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,223
- John Smith.

579
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:38,056
- John Smith, huh?

580
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:38,889
Is he still around here?

581
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:40,389
When did you see him last?

582
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,440
I gotta find somebody
who can talk English.

583
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,453
I'll be right back!

584
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:51,256
- Joe!

585
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:52,089
Joe!

586
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,920
Grayson.

587
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,860
Your platoon's dug in over there.

588
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,260
Come here a minute, will ya?

589
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,560
I've got a message for
ya from the colonel.

590
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,530
He was up here inspecting our positions.

591
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,430
- The colonel?

592
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,800
- That's right.

593
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,930
He said to tell you he
was particularly pleased

594
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,450
with the way your platoon was deployed.

595
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,550
- Thanks for covering up.

596
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,900
And now I'm
supposed to say you're welcome

597
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,507
and that's that until the next time, huh?

598
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:24,610
- There won't be any next time.

599
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,120
Don't worry about that.

600
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,570
- I'll tell ya when to leave.

601
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,590
You're such a stickler on

602
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,610
military courtesy for your men.

603
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,900
From now on, you and I are going

604
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,860
by the book, understand?

605
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,693
- Yes, sir.

606
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,110
- I don't mind telling you, Grayson,

607
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,150
if there was any chance of
getting a replacement for you

608
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,440
I'd have had you court-martialed for this.

609
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,620
Ever since you joined the outfit,

610
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,590
you've been the one man in this

611
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,420
company who's been out of step!

612
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,930
You'd better pick it up, lieutenant,

613
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,018
and pick it up fast,

614
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,840
or you're gonna find yourself volunteering

615
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,680
for every dirty detail that comes up!

616
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,220
Is that clear?

617
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,373
- Yes, sir.

618
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,633
That'll be all.

619
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:04,691
♪ It wasn't the moon above ♪

620
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,499
- Did you do a good job, lieutenant?

621
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:10,039
♪ That made me fall in love ♪

622
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,607
♪ It was just those eyes ♪

623
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,940
♪ Those beautiful eyes ♪

624
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,280
- Where's Kamakura?

625
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,113
- Sam?

626
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:23,540
Out looking for water, lieutenant.

627
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,480
How do you like that?

628
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,100
Dying of thirst in the middle of a river.

629
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,740
- I wanna see him the minute he gets back.

630
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,573
- Yes, sir.

631
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,450
Hiya, paisan!

632
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,563
- Masami!

633
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:47,396
Eddie!

634
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,643
- Vino, fresh off the vine!

635
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:55,481
Salute.

636
00:33:58,378 --> 00:33:59,774
- Good, eh, paisan?

637
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,599
- Free sample.

638
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,884
- Thanks.

639
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,597
- Eddie!

640
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:14,430
Eddie!

641
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,480
- You stay here, Tommy, watch us!

642
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,157
Come on, keep close to the wall!

643
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:29,112
Stay here, one at a time.

644
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:25,739
- Anybody home?

645
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:27,803
Keep me covered.

646
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,182
You okay, Masami?

647
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:55,123
- Just a scratch.

648
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,980
- Jerry intelligence officer.

649
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,330
They're great at disguises.

650
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,630
Hiya, paisan.

651
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,400
- Shells would be coming in a lot closer

652
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
if those Jerries were still
in that observation post.

653
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,308
One of them was an officer you say?

654
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,061
- Oh, yes, colonel, sir.

655
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,370
- Well, you certainly earned that.

656
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,670
Take this over to S2, sergeant.

657
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,503
- Yes, sir.

658
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,330
- Too bad about that 100th Battalion man.

659
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,170
What'd they say at the aid station

660
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,390
about the other one who was wounded?

661
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,430
- Million-dollar wound, sir.

662
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,880
They're sending him back to Rome.

663
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,900
- Good.

664
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,830
Well, anytime you're in
the neighborhood, drop in.

665
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,663
- Thank you, sir.

666
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:01,496
- I mean that.

667
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,387
I wanna keep in close touch
with you men on the line.

668
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,180
They been treatin' you all right?

669
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,040
Yes, sir.

670
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,690
- You're sure now, no complaints?

671
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,783
- No, sir.

672
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:12,763
- Well, good luck to you.

673
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,619
- Sir, could I have a word with you?

674
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:19,710
- Well, of course.

675
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,770
At ease, lieutenant.

676
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,140
- You remember, sir,
that I told you I came

677
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,230
from the 36th Division?

678
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,580
- I remember it very well.

679
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,193
- Well, sir, I just
happened to hear that the

680
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,820
36th is somewhere in this area.

681
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,690
- Was, lieutenant, they're
way up ahead of us now.

682
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,590
- Oh.

683
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,630
Oh, well, in that case, sir—

684
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,510
- Still like to get back
in the Texas Army, eh?

685
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,160
- Oh no sir, I was just hoping

686
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,560
I'd get a chance to visit them.

687
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,680
- Well, I'll do better than that.

688
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,010
If we ever meet up with the 36th,

689
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,190
I'll try and work out a transfer.

690
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,040
- Oh, thank you very much, sir.

691
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,460
- Not at all, it'll be a pleasure.

692
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,913
That'll be all, lieutenant.

693
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:58,424
- It's all right, paisan.

694
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:01,174
Maybe he know we scared too, huh?

695
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:04,740
- Gives a man a nice feeling

696
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,330
knowing you can always go to the old man

697
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,563
if you're not gettin' a
fair shake, huh, lieutenant?

698
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,180
Sir, I feel bad about
forgettin' to call you

699
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,410
when we moved out of
that town this afternoon.

700
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,480
Look, you see the way it happened—

701
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,704
- Forget it, forget it.

702
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:16,537
- I can't.

703
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:17,370
It was all my fault.

704
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,010
And they might have had
you up for desertion.

705
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,360
But, it'll never get out.

706
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,400
The men'll keep it quiet.

707
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,498
I'll see to that, sir.

708
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:25,627
- Thanks, thanks.

709
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:55,746
- Squad leaders, up front.

710
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,545
- Squad leaders, up front.

711
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:59,320
Squad leaders, up front.

712
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,620
- Squad leaders, up front.

713
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,880
- Squad leaders, up front.

714
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,180
- Squad leaders, up front.

715
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,540
- Are you from the 100th Battalion?

716
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,580
- Yeah.

717
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,849
- What happens when a man gets hit?

718
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,073
- Sometimes they yell.

719
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,343
Sometimes they don't.

720
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,670
Squad leaders don't last long.

721
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,503
- I mean the medics.

722
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:26,336
How do they get to you?

723
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,169
Medics! Medics!

724
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,450
- Get on the other side of the road!

725
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,611
Hit it!

726
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,156
- Let's go, boy.

727
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,953
Squad leaders up front.

728
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,074
Squad leaders up front.

729
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:47,011
Squad leaders up front.

730
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,550
- Squad leaders up front.

731
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,404
- Squad leaders up front.

732
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:51,682
- Squad leaders up front.

733
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,683
Squad leaders up front.

734
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,000
Squad leaders up front.

735
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,255
- What are you waiting for, sergeant?

736
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:02,255
I forgot.

737
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,820
- Hey, you'd better move, Sam.

738
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,870
Maybe he gonna shake.

739
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,642
- Have a good time, Frank.

740
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,570
- How can I miss?

741
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,570
Rome, the greatest
architecture in the world.

742
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,140
24-hour passes.

743
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,810
Big-hearted, ain't they?

744
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,390
- I'm gonna see a lot of
things in the next 24 hours

745
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,610
I've dreamed about all my life.

746
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,367
The Forum, Saint Peter's, the Pantheon—

747
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,230
- Any other outfit, I bet
they get three-day passes.

748
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,915
Yeah, and not just one
man at a time, either.

749
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:45,881
- Ah, chick, chick, chick,

750
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:47,200
chick, chick, chick, chick.

751
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,033
- Relax.

752
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,250
That reminds me, Tommy,

753
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,230
I hear we're having chicken for dinner.

754
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,063
No joke?

755
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:54,030
- Yeah, I was talking to one of the cooks.

756
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,060
Fried chicken.

757
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,326
- Good, boy.

758
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,557
That's what I like best.

759
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:58,460
- Not me.

760
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,060
You know what I like best?

761
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,730
Barbecued pork, yes, sir.

762
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,490
There's nothing like barbecued pork.

763
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,638
Especially the way I make it.

764
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:16,305
- Mail call!

765
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,167
Jingu.

766
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,260
Hitrai.

767
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,093
Gutsizaki.

768
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:21,200
Mishima.

769
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,033
Here! Here!

770
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:27,033
Kawaquichi.

771
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:55,622
- You like-a vino, Joe?

772
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,451
- Ah, no, he no for sale.

773
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:00,510
- Three bottles, Joe.

774
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,745
- Not for nothin'.

775
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,283
Waste time.

776
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:06,314
Come on, paisan.

777
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:10,423
- Family, family.

778
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:13,370
- Hungry, hungry.

779
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,292
- Okay, plenty meat on her.

780
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,024
- No eat, no eat.

781
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:19,332
- Oh, no, no.

782
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,773
Papa, Mama.

783
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,033
- Oh.

784
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:36,561
Paisan, him kind of young for papa, no?

785
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:40,665
- We wait.

786
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,411
Three months.

787
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:48,307
Nine bottles, 10!

788
00:44:48,307 --> 00:44:49,307
- No!

789
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:50,224
- No, Papa.

790
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:55,075
- Hey, Tommy!

791
00:44:55,075 --> 00:44:56,687
Look what I got.

792
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:58,043
Cookies.

793
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:58,876
Here, help yourself.

794
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,414
Paisan too.

795
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:02,700
- He no like cookies.

796
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,190
Maybe bambinos, eh?

797
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,253
- Sure, go ahead.

798
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,250
- Who that from, Sam?

799
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,363
Your mother?

800
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:13,200
- Terry.

801
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,580
Hey, remember that town we took?

802
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,413
Suvereto?

803
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,280
It was on a news
broadcast, coast to coast,

804
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,760
and they mentioned the 442.

805
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,593
- No kidding?

806
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,426
- I'm tellin' you.

807
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,150
And there've been newspaper
stories, lots of 'em.

808
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,890
The 100th is getting the
Presidential Citation

809
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,815
from General Mark Clark,
Sassetta, Hill 140.

810
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:27,950
- Hey.

811
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:28,783
Let me see that.

812
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,750
How you like that?

813
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,740
They gonna let your kid brother

814
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,300
leave relocation camp and work on a farm.

815
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,581
Next month he gonna pick
sugar beets in Idaho.

816
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:41,510
- Well, what do ya know.

817
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,860
He's been trying to swing
that deal for months.

818
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,763
- Good boy.

819
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:47,223
All okay, nobody sick.

820
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,670
Oh, oh, excuse, Sam.

821
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,230
- That's okay.

822
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,530
I'll read the rest to you.

823
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,907
- "Honestly, Sam, you'd hardly
recognize the old homestead.

824
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:02,957
"Maybe it looks the same, the
barracks, the barbed wire,

825
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:05,837
"the MPs, but it isn't the same anymore.

826
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:07,157
"Nothing's the same.

827
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:09,887
"Because everybody knows
what the 442 is doing.

828
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:11,497
"And what means most to me is the change

829
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:12,850
"in the kids in my class."

830
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,753
She teaches in camp school.

831
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:15,747
- I know, I know, first grade.

832
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:18,187
- "They were such sad little
people, never laughed,

833
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,517
"never made a sound.

834
00:46:19,517 --> 00:46:22,607
"Today, I'm happy to say,
I have as noisy a classroom

835
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:24,510
"as you'll find in America."

836
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,270
- More better now, eh, kotonk?

837
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,450
- Looks that way, Kanaka.

838
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,493
Plenty better now.

839
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:32,067
"I miss you so very much, my darling.

840
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,367
"I can't find words to tell you

841
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,130
"how dear you are to me."

842
00:47:02,826 --> 00:47:03,659
- How was it?

843
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,492
How was Rome?

844
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:05,325
I'll see you tomorrow!

845
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:06,903
I gotta go to the C.P.
and pick up my pass!

846
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,838
End of the line, everybody out.

847
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,257
- Just wanted to let you
know we're back, sir.

848
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:31,133
- Oh, good.

849
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,020
You're just in time.

850
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,630
- Oh, thanks.

851
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,026
- Sergeant, have the driver report

852
00:47:36,026 --> 00:47:37,360
to the motor pool, will ya?

853
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,193
- Yes, sir.

854
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:39,026
- He's got a full tank, sir.

855
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:40,870
All set to go with the next batch.

856
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,373
- I was all set to go too.

857
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,040
Change of orders, we're
going back on the line.

858
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,420
- That's kind of rough.

859
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,450
Somebody was telling me
your folks came from Rome.

860
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,980
- A little town near there.

861
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,040
Oh, well, I'll get to see it someday.

862
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,280
- Sure you will.

863
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,260
- Hey, we met up with some of your

864
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,093
folks while you were gone.

865
00:47:58,093 --> 00:47:59,246
Your old outfit.

866
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:00,079
- The 36th!

867
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,550
- They passed us on their way back.

868
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,220
The Texas Wonders had all they could take

869
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,860
so they called in the 442.

870
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,810
- Where'd they go?

871
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,870
- The word is they're being moved

872
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,520
to another theater of operations.

873
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,690
- Is that straight?

874
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,547
- Looks like you're stuck with us

875
00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:12,893
for the rest of the war.

876
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,800
- Guy gets in to fight the Japs

877
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,059
and winds up fightin' with 'em.

878
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:20,750
It's a hot one when you
come to think of it.

879
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,430
- Oh, I don't know.

880
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,100
A lot of us have parents who
were born in enemy countries.

881
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,180
Italian Americans, German Americans—

882
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,900
- That's different, sir, and you know it.

883
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,733
- Why?

884
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,070
- Well, it's just—

885
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,950
- The shape of their eyes?

886
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,600
Or is it the color of their skin?

887
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,970
- Tell the truth, sir,

888
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,480
wouldn't you rather be
with some other outfit?

889
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,113
- If I knew of a better
outfit, but I don't.

890
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,520
- Will that be all, sir?

891
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,480
You don't
have to be so formal.

892
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,930
- It was your idea to go by the book.

893
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,883
- That was a long time ago.

894
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,950
- I'll see ya later.

895
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:06,910
- How was it, lieutenant?

896
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,410
Great!

897
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,050
- I hope the supply sergeant

898
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,050
takes good care of your pig.

899
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,830
Yep, I sure hope he feeds
him good so he'll be nice

900
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,913
and fat when we get back off the line.

901
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,423
- Hey, Frank, look!

902
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:32,370
Look at that!

903
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,770
- Must be an old Roman villa.

904
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,175
Yeah, you can tell it's
Roman by those columns.

905
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,970
- Rubble from another war, huh?

906
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,380
- It's hard to believe.

907
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,070
Over 2000 years old.

908
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,030
- The battles that must have
been fought around here.

909
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,820
Napoleon, Charlemagne, Caesar,

910
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,030
Alexander the Great,

911
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,870
all the way back to biblical times.

912
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,410
- More better we fight
like biblical times.

913
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,910
I read in the Bible.

914
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,810
Your army pick number one man,

915
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,417
enemy pick number one man,

916
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:08,010
and by big fight, two men,

917
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,920
one killed, war over.

918
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,070
- I nominate Lieutenant
Grayson for our side.

919
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,263
- No, I wouldn't know who to root for.

920
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,550
- It's some kind of
headquarters all right,

921
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,068
and it looks like they're
gettin' ready to pull out.

922
00:50:28,672 --> 00:50:30,490
- Yeah, with all their maps and records.

923
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,593
And one machine gun's holding us back.

924
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:42,582
A little more to the right!

925
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:43,415
30 yards!

926
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,149
- Got any more?

927
00:50:45,149 --> 00:50:45,982
Be right back.

928
00:50:45,982 --> 00:50:47,803
30 yards to
the right, can you hear me?

929
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:48,813
Yeah, how's this?

930
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,640
- Come on, let's take a walk.

931
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,943
Hey, you over there!

932
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,294
Not you!

933
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:14,966
You take over, Ohhara.

934
00:52:19,652 --> 00:52:21,252
Keep firing that mortar!

935
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:22,419
Keep it going!

936
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:32,060
Where's that mortar?

937
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:53,883
- I don't think these columns'll
be here for the next war.

938
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,277
How about that mortar?

939
00:52:57,277 --> 00:52:58,527
Right away!

940
00:52:58,527 --> 00:52:59,363
I gotta move it!

941
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:18,274
Hurry up with that mortar!

942
00:53:18,274 --> 00:53:20,024
Okay, okay!

943
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,042
- They moved the gun!

944
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:30,042
- Right, 50 yards right!

945
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,089
- Short! Short!

946
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,172
Give it another 50 yards!

947
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,360
Now over to the left, just a little!

948
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:55,658
That's it!

949
00:53:55,658 --> 00:53:56,575
Pour it on!

950
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:29,440
- Hold it! Hold it!

951
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,140
Cease-fire!

952
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,973
Let's go!

953
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,441
- What kind of troops are these?

954
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,686
Chinese?

955
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:16,761
- Japanese.

956
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:18,376
Didn't Hitler tell ya?

957
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:22,959
Japan surrendered and they're
fighting on our side now.

958
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,770
- Well, it beats walking.

959
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,618
- Maybe walking through
Italy wasn't so bad.

960
00:55:43,618 --> 00:55:45,230
Didn't you get the latest latrinogram?

961
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,220
We're shipping out.

962
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,063
- Shipping out?

963
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,490
- And so we take leave of sunny Italy

964
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,350
and sail the seven seas to—

965
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,400
- To where?

966
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,930
- My guess is the Pacific.

967
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,790
- You really think so, lieutenant?

968
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,460
- Yeah, but don't worry about it.

969
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,720
I haven't guessed right once

970
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,120
since I've been in the Army.

971
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,122
- Watch that stuff!

972
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:11,955
- Sorry.

973
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,556
- Tommy!

974
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,820
- Oh, hello, lieutenant.

975
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,540
- I told you to go easy on that leg.

976
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,373
Plenty okay now, lieutenant.

977
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:34,540
- Well, what did you
leave the hospital for?

978
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,440
- I've been still, lieutenant.

979
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,273
Three weeks.

980
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:39,100
Long time, sir.

981
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,333
- Don't you realize
officially you're AWOL?

982
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,040
I don't know whether to put
you in for a Silver Star

983
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,520
or have you court-martialed.

984
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,500
- Gotta leave hospital, sir.

985
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,470
Big rumor, 442 going Pacific.

986
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,550
Me plenty sad sack get left behind, huh?

987
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,290
Sir, maybe we still gonna fight Japan.

988
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,820
You think so, maybe?

989
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,200
- No, Tommy.

990
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,350
It's definitely France.

991
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:04,640
- It's bad cough.

992
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,631
I catch him in a hospital.

993
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:07,441
More better now, sea air good.

994
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,230
Well, goodbye, lieutenant.

995
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,853
- Goodbye, Tommy.

996
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,060
You are about to play a personal part

997
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,030
in pushing the Germans out of France.

998
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,770
Just west of the Riviera
district in southern France

999
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,170
lies the port of Marseilles.

1000
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,500
You will be fortunate indeed

1001
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,470
if you are stationed in
this fascinating city.

1002
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,500
However, the chances are

1003
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,920
you will be located in the provinces.

1004
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,990
Rooms with private bath are still deluxe

1005
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,120
in provincial towns, and you
won't always have steam heat,

1006
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,100
but there are many compensations.

1007
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,630
For instance, your
breakfast will be brought

1008
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,335
to your bedroom without extra charge.

1009
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,570
First class on French trains

1010
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,800
ranks with our extra-fare trains,

1011
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,930
second ranks with our parlor car

1012
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,240
and third class is like
our ordinary-day coach.

1013
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,970
If French coaches are less
comfortable than ours,

1014
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,120
remember that they are
also less expensive.

1015
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,120
It all evens up.

1016
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,453
- Who's got the time?

1017
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,680
- 2:20 sir.

1018
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,860
- Thanks.

1019
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,780
- Who do you think that I
oughta see about it, sir?

1020
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,170
- S1 personnel.

1021
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,710
They assign the new replacements,

1022
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,640
but they're not gonna put two

1023
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,560
brothers in the same platoon.

1024
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,127
- My kid brother's got
a way with him, sir,

1025
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:37,850
and he's just liable to talk them into it.

1026
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,180
- Bad enough being in the same regiment,

1027
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,940
but the same platoon...

1028
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,080
- Yeah, I'd hate for my
folks to get two telegrams

1029
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,611
from the War Department on the same day.

1030
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,100
- Where are you going?

1031
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,460
- Think I'll ride with my platoon, sir.

1032
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,740
- You're overdoing the
"sir" business, lieutenant.

1033
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,710
- I keep forgetting.

1034
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,722
And here I've been an officer

1035
00:58:55,722 --> 00:58:57,031
for two hours and 20 minutes.

1036
00:58:57,864 --> 00:58:59,160
How are you doing, Grayson?

1037
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,820
- Hey, Sam, you think Terry okay?

1038
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,650
- Sure, it was just a little cold.

1039
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,740
- I feel more better
when the mail catch up.

1040
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,650
Long time he no get mail.

1041
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,230
- I wonder how my brother's making out.

1042
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,750
- Me too.

1043
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,280
I guess he work on the sugar-beet farm

1044
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,713
already two, three weeks.

1045
00:59:23,636 --> 00:59:25,340
Hey, Ohhara, we want the mail!

1046
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,317
Write your congressman.

1047
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:28,577
10-hut!

1048
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:31,384
As you were.

1049
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:32,440
Carry on, men.

1050
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,273
- How do you like that?

1051
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:35,306
Do they give a commission
to one of us buddhaheads?

1052
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:36,790
No, they give it to the mick.

1053
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,280
- Ohhara, the fighting Irishman.

1054
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,070
- Faith, and you can say that again.

1055
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,600
Now, get along with your blarney.

1056
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,075
I've got something to tell you.

1057
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:43,908
- At ease!

1058
00:59:43,908 --> 00:59:44,741
At ease!

1059
00:59:44,741 --> 00:59:46,740
Let's be having a little
military courtesy.

1060
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,310
Yes, sir.

1061
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:50,080
- I haven't been assigned yet,

1062
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,030
but it looks like I'll be
taking over another platoon.

1063
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,219
I probably won't be
seeing much of you guys.

1064
00:59:55,219 --> 00:59:57,953
I just wanted to say, well, so long.

1065
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,430
- He gonna make good platoon leader.

1066
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,980
- Yeah, while he lasts.

1067
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,453
He's welcome to them bars.

1068
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,370
- Sam, look at those buildings!

1069
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,203
17th century!

1070
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:15,493
I'm looking at that bakery.

1071
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,813
- Go ahead, Tommy.

1072
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:22,200
I'll keep an eye on the pig.

1073
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,550
- Stick close to the train, you guys.

1074
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,060
I'm tired of rounding up stragglers.

1075
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,003
What'd he say?

1076
01:00:37,003 --> 01:00:38,600
- Oh, that's Japanese for thank you.

1077
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,053
They're very polite.

♪ All the livelong day ♪
- No, no, no!

1096
01:01:24,649 --> 01:01:26,506
When you learn song?

1097
01:01:26,506 --> 01:01:28,420
- Ah, last week.

1098
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,840
Soldiers.

1099
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,673
- 36th Division?

1100
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:31,670
- I think so.

1101
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,037
Big T.

1102
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:34,269
- Are they still here?

1103
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:39,269
No, packed yesterday.

1104
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,580
- Well, well, the ambassador from Texas.

1105
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,160
- Good afternoon, sir.

1106
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,760
- You know, lieutenant, I had
you down as a determined man,

1107
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,170
but I didn't think you had enough drag

1108
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,440
to get the whole darned outfit

1109
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,810
transferred to the 36th.

1110
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,770
- Transferred?

1111
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:05,603
- That's right, lieutenant.

1112
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:07,683
We've been attached to the 36th Division.

1113
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,460
I guess that makes us honorary Texans.

1114
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,600
- Well, fan my brow.

1115
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,350
Keep an eye out for
cattle-rustlers, partner.

1116
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,977
- Well, what do you know about that?

1117
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:21,086
- I thought you'd be pleased, lieutenant.

1118
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:22,480
This is the man we've
been looking for, major.

1119
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,840
One of the new combat
commissions to replace him.

1120
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,611
- Well, there's one in
his platoon sir, Ohhara.

1121
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:27,780
- Good, he can take over.

1122
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,990
- Take over my platoon, sir?

1123
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,470
- We've had a request
for a liaison officer

1124
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,110
to work out of 36th headquarters.

1125
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:33,943
Someone who can get along with them

1126
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:35,500
and knows the 442 thoroughly.

1127
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,390
- But, sir, I've always been on the line.

1128
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,770
Do you think I have the qualifications

1129
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:39,810
for a headquarter's job?

1130
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:40,740
- I think you'll make good.

1131
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,190
When a man wants anything as
badly as you've wanted this.

1132
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,930
- But sir, I don't want this.

1133
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,070
Remember, I told you I
just wanted to visit them.

1134
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,890
I've got a lot of friends in the 36th.

1135
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,489
- None of them at headquarters, I take it.

1136
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:52,220
Sorry I couldn't arrange to have you

1137
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,460
sent back to your platoon.

1138
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,293
- Colonel Pence—

1139
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:56,150
- Your orders will be issued immediately!

1140
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,314
- All aboard!

1141
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:07,621
Texas special!

1142
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,393
Dallas, Forth Worth, Galveston,

1143
01:03:09,393 --> 01:03:11,541
Houston and all points south.

1144
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,193
Yeah, man!

1145
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:16,677
- Ya-hoo!

1146
01:03:21,037 --> 01:03:24,718
Don't forget to write.

1147
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,490
- How do you like that
Texas artillery, strangers?

1148
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,323
- Stranger?

1149
01:03:37,323 --> 01:03:38,600
Man, I'm from Texas myself.

1150
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,090
- Well, pull up a chair
and have a mint julep.

1151
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,560
- That's mighty neighborly, friend,

1152
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,420
but we're heading back towards town.

1153
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,470
Another posse's gonna spell us for a bit.

1154
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,243
Tommy's sure anxious to
get back to that town

1155
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,000
where he left Paisan.

1156
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,273
- Ain't love wonderful?

1157
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:56,347
- Howdy, stranger!

1158
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:57,180
- Aloha.

1159
01:04:03,163 --> 01:04:05,150
- There's only one thing I don't

1160
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,600
like about these buddhaheads.

1161
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,147
They don't dig 'em long enough.

1162
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:28,270
- Hello, my friend!

1163
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,810
He's here, the little Paisan.

1164
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,643
He's here.

1165
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:35,583
- Paisan.

1166
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,416
Hello, Paisan.

1167
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,360
You looking good, boy.

1168
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,015
You're looking wonderful, Paisan.

1169
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:40,925
Come on, Paisan.

1170
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:43,121
You're beautiful, Paisan.

1171
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,250
- Nice pig.

1172
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,945
He miss you much.

1173
01:04:49,945 --> 01:04:51,500
- I miss him too.

1174
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,030
Oh, thanks for taking care of him.

1175
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:54,863
Thanks a lot.

1176
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:56,703
- Thank you.

1177
01:04:56,703 --> 01:04:57,540
You are very kind.

1178
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:59,730
- What's the matter?

1179
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,563
You don't smoke?

1180
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,200
- Yes, I smoke.

1181
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,790
I was hoping maybe something
to eat for the children.

1182
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,520
Chocolate, crackers, anything.

1183
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,003
They have so little, so little to eat.

1184
01:05:12,393 --> 01:05:14,520
- I don't have anything to eat.

1185
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,620
Trade the cigarettes.

1186
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,453
Two packs.

1187
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:18,280
You can get a couple of chickens for that.

1188
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,113
- Not here.

1189
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:20,140
No chickens left.

1190
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,973
Nothing.

1191
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,480
- All right.

1192
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,620
I'll come back later.

1193
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,320
- I hate to ask.

1194
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,630
- It won't be much.

1195
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,680
All we get is K rations.

1196
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,180
- It will be a feast for them.

1197
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,400
I wish I could get something better.

1198
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,530
Well, see you later.

1199
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,296
Goodbye, my friend.

1200
01:06:19,532 --> 01:06:20,365
Thank you.

1201
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:21,830
Thank you very much.

1202
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,084
How wonderful for the children.

1203
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,339
- Kanakas.

1204
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:02,942
The ones from Hawaii.

1205
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:05,451
Let's stop a minute, huh?

1206
01:07:05,451 --> 01:07:06,784
I won't be long.

1207
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:28,739
Throw those bums out!

1208
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:29,759
Yeah, go on, get up there.

1209
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:31,270
- No, they're doing fine!

1210
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:32,707
Come on, hula-hula, Kaz.

1211
01:07:37,038 --> 01:07:37,871
- Kaz!

1212
01:07:38,926 --> 01:07:40,014
- Hey!

1213
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:10,180
Would you like some wine?

1214
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:16,200
- These men, the little ones,

1215
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,840
they are really Japanese?

1216
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,810
- Hey, shorty, she wants
to know if you're Japanese.

1217
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,660
I guess we can let her in on it, huh?

1218
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,591
They're our new secret weapon.

1219
01:08:25,591 --> 01:08:27,222
Twilight fighters.

1220
01:08:27,222 --> 01:08:28,055
- Twilight fighters?

1221
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,200
- Yeah.

1222
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,300
The Army gives them shots

1223
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,950
to make them turn yellow, see.

1224
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,500
They send them out in the evening,

1225
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,140
just as the sun's going down.

1226
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,433
The enemy can't see 'em in that light.

1227
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:37,703
Get the idea?

1228
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
- That guy's been looking
for trouble all night.

1229
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,070
If he makes one more crack, I'll—

1230
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,903
Tommy!

1231
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:43,736
How are you?
- Lieutenant Grayson!

1232
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:44,569
How's the leg?

1233
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:45,402
- Fit like a fiddle.

1234
01:08:45,402 --> 01:08:46,400
- Hiya, fellas.
- Howdy, Grayson.

1235
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,408
Say, who's your friend,

1236
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:48,241
the one with all the stripes?

1237
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:49,074
They don't care who they make

1238
01:08:49,074 --> 01:08:49,907
platoon sergeant anymore.

1239
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:51,880
- How about having a
refill with us lieutenant?

1240
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,260
- Thanks Frank, I wanna
say hello to somebody,

1241
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,270
my old platoon sergeant.

1242
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,200
I trained under him.

1243
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,206
Be right back.

1244
01:08:56,206 --> 01:08:57,421
Culley!

1245
01:08:57,421 --> 01:08:58,254
- Grayson!

1246
01:08:58,254 --> 01:08:59,087
How are you?

1247
01:08:59,087 --> 01:08:59,920
- Lieutenant Grayson.

1248
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,753
Yeah, how about that?

1249
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:01,586
- How about a drink?

1250
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:02,419
Great, great.

1251
01:09:02,419 --> 01:09:03,970
Come on, there's room down here.

1252
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:07,140
- That guy would be a buddy of Grayson's.

1253
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,110
- Five to one he don't
come back for that drink.

1254
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,010
Get it up.

1255
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,424
- They tell me you really got it made.

1256
01:09:15,424 --> 01:09:16,720
What is this liaison racket?

1257
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,540
- Oh, it varies, from a soft snap

1258
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,270
to an extra soft snap.

1259
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,280
Thank you.

1260
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,850
Tomorrow I'm moving out with you.

1261
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:23,683
How do you like that?

1262
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:25,070
Back with the old platoon.

1263
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,630
- You mean, I gotta take orders from you?

1264
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,570
- No, I don't mess around
with you dog faces.

1265
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,560
I'll be with the artillery observer.

1266
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,290
You're getting your
artillery from the 442,

1267
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,570
and he's never worked with them before.

1268
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,720
- They're sending us up
without our own artillery?

1269
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,743
Just the Japs?

1270
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:42,580
- They're a good outfit, Culley.

1271
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,790
Plenty good.

1272
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:44,720
- Practically winning the war

1273
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,270
single-handed from what I hear.

1274
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,043
Japs.

1275
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,400
- Let's get outta here, huh?

1276
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,350
- Yeah, I could use a little fresh air.

1277
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,846
You win, Chick.

1278
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,750
- Japs in a Texas division.

1279
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,973
Man, oh, man!

1280
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,830
- Come here a minute.

1281
01:10:13,437 --> 01:10:15,680
Culley, they're not Japs.

1282
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,513
- Huh?

1283
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:17,680
- They're Japanese Americans.

1284
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,552
Nisei, or, if you prefer, buddhaheads.

1285
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:21,920
But not Japs.

1286
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,540
They don't like it and neither do I.

1287
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,280
- What are you, a Jap-lover or something?

1288
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,700
- I said they're not Japs.

1289
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,150
I'm warning ya, Culley.

1290
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:28,983
- You're what?

1291
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:29,970
- Warning ya.

1292
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,770
- Lieutenant, that gold bar
looks real sweet on you,

1293
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,650
but I do believe you're getting

1294
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,020
a little big for your britches.

1295
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,410
- I can always take the bar off.

1296
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,613
- Any time you say.

1297
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:03,960
- Okara!

1298
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,793
Yo!

1299
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:05,731
- Misoka.

1300
01:11:05,731 --> 01:11:06,908
Here! Here!

1301
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:07,741
- Nishigoka.

1302
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:08,574
Hey!

1303
01:11:08,574 --> 01:11:09,407
- No letters?

1304
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:10,270
- Keep your pants on.

1305
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,150
- Come on, snap it up.

1306
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:12,097
- Kiri!

1307
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:13,320
Yo-ho!

1308
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,470
- Kamakura!

1309
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,303
Oh, here, here!

1310
01:11:15,303 --> 01:11:16,233
I take it!

1311
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,808
- Cookies!

1312
01:11:17,808 --> 01:11:18,862
- Ikagani!

1313
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,150
- Here!

1314
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,067
- One cookie!

1315
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:25,990
- Hey, look!

1316
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,746
How you like that, two sets.

1317
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:29,079
I go see Masami!

1318
01:11:32,298 --> 01:11:33,140
Two sets.

1319
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,512
Sam, Sam, wiki-wiki.

1320
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:36,030
- I'm wiki-wikiing as fast as I can.

1321
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,090
Anything from my brother?

1322
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:39,280
- No, all from relocation center.

1323
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,733
Sugar report from Terry.

1324
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,477
"Dear Sam, I hate to start
out a letter this way,

1325
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:50,190
"but I think it best to get
the bad news over with first."

1326
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,770
- Her cold, she no get better, huh?

1327
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,220
- No, Terry's okay.

1328
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,150
- Your mother been get sick?

1329
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,140
Your father?

1330
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,502
- It's my brother.

1331
01:11:56,502 --> 01:11:58,030
- He been lose his job on the farm?

1332
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,620
Yeah, him and a couple of his buddies.

1333
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,477
A gang beat them to a pulp

1334
01:12:00,477 --> 01:12:02,550
and said they'd lynch them
if they ever came back.

1335
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,789
- Why they do that?

1336
01:12:03,789 --> 01:12:04,622
Why?

1337
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:05,455
- Why?

1338
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:06,288
Because they've got slant eyes.

1339
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,430
That's a crime in some
places, didn't you know that?

1340
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,560
How do ya like that?

1341
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,700
We're good enough to carry rifles,

1342
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,620
but we're not good enough
to pick sugar beets.

1343
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,190
- Take it easy, Sam.

1344
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,130
- Sure, sure, take it easy.

1345
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,520
Take it lying down.

1346
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,050
- Go on, beat it!

1347
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:19,883
Blow off!

1348
01:12:19,883 --> 01:12:20,716
- Ain't I been telling you?

1349
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:21,549
Suckers, that's what we are.

1350
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:22,640
- Ah, chick, chick, chick,

1351
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,123
chick, chick, chick.

1352
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:25,920
- How would you like a dental appointment?

1353
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,753
- Let's go, boy!

1354
01:12:26,753 --> 01:12:27,586
Katonk.

1355
01:12:27,586 --> 01:12:28,419
- Break it up!

1356
01:12:28,419 --> 01:12:29,252
If you're looking for a scrap,

1357
01:12:29,252 --> 01:12:30,490
you won't have long to wait.

1358
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,440
We've been alerted.

1359
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,222
Pull your tents down and
get ready to move out.

1360
01:12:33,222 --> 01:12:34,055
- Pull 'em down?

1361
01:12:34,055 --> 01:12:35,310
We just put 'em up.

1362
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,520
- The men Lieutenant Grayson moved out

1363
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,700
with have been surrounded.

1364
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,713
- The whole battalion?

1365
01:12:38,713 --> 01:12:39,546
- What's left of 'em.

1366
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:41,160
Grayson's okay so far.

1367
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,080
Artillery observer got
hit and he took over.

1368
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,040
- Just so the lieutenant is safe.

1369
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,370
Him and his buddy.

1370
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:48,033
- His dear old platoon sergeant.

1371
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,930
- What's up with Sam?

1372
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:54,580
- He just got some bad news.

1373
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,990
- He's not the only one.

1374
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,550
They're gonna send the new
replacements up on line

1375
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,730
as soon as they arrive,

1376
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,000
the batch my kid brother's in.

1377
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,883
18-years-old.

1378
01:13:14,986 --> 01:13:16,236
- Hey, Grayson!

1379
01:13:18,368 --> 01:13:19,201
Medic!

1380
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:20,456
Where's the medic?

1381
01:13:20,456 --> 01:13:21,289
There he is!

1382
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:22,539
Over here, Joe!

1383
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,566
I found a full one.

1384
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:27,793
- Thanks, pal.

1385
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:29,493
- Give me a slug of that, will ya?

1386
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:36,745
- Hey, Grayson!

1387
01:13:38,351 --> 01:13:39,184
Look out!

1388
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,533
You okay, Culley?

1389
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:50,470
- Where's that Jap artillery?

1390
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,303
Where is it?

1391
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,063
- Wildcat six.

1392
01:13:56,063 --> 01:13:56,900
This is Wildcat two.

1393
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,230
Fire mission, over.

1394
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,233
Fire mission point.

1395
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,110
Fire mission point,
Fox-Able-Easy-Baker-Mike-Charlie,

1396
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,560
and point,
King-Sugar-Charlie-Love-Able-How.

1397
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,100
- Wildcat two, this is Wildcat six.

1398
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:11,963
Stand by.

1399
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,160
One round smoke on way.

1400
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,527
One round smoke on way.

1401
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,390
- Can't get a thing outta this one, sir.

1402
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,290
- We got enough from the others.

1403
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,919
Send him over to division headquarters.

1404
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,570
- Get anything?

1405
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:00,440
- Yes, sir.

1406
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,500
Added to what we already know,

1407
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,300
I can give ya a pretty clear picture.

1408
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,133
- Good.

1409
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,250
- It's all dense woods.

1410
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,160
Those roads on the map
are just forest trails,

1411
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,366
and Jerry has roadblocks on all of 'em.

1412
01:15:09,366 --> 01:15:10,640
The men are surrounded on three sides

1413
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,400
by elements of the
338th Infantry Division,

1414
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,040
the 198th Fusilier Battalion,

1415
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,220
and the 202nd Mountain Battalion.

1416
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,053
To the northeast—

1417
01:15:18,053 --> 01:15:19,763
- Well, let me see it on the map, captain.

1418
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:21,990
- Well, starting here,

1419
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,610
the Germans are dug in
on a continuous line

1420
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,053
all the way around to here.

1421
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:28,303
There's a gap here,

1422
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,380
and one here that I know of,

1423
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,213
but they're covered by

1424
01:15:31,213 --> 01:15:33,350
machine guns with interlocking fire.

1425
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,920
There's a steep ridge here
that dominates this sector.

1426
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,520
It's almost straight up on both sides,

1427
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,870
and they have a strong
force sitting up on top.

1428
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,530
How far away from
here is the lost battalion?

1429
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,110
Well, I'd say 1,000 yards.

1430
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,943
They're just about here.

1431
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:50,181
We'll have troops within

1432
01:15:50,181 --> 01:15:52,147
striking distance tonight.

1433
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,070
- All right, Ohhara, this is your spot.

1434
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,903
Good luck.

1435
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,330
- Come on, shake a leg, will ya?

1436
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,410
- This don't make sense.

1437
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:14,463
Sticking our necks out for guys

1438
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,140
like that buddy of Grayson's.

1439
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:16,973
That sergeant, that's the kind

1440
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,820
who ganged up on your brother.

1441
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,140
- We get to the lost battalion,

1442
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,080
that sergeant gonna change

1443
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,250
his mind about us buddhaheads.

1444
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,300
Plenty people already we change, eh, Sam?

1445
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:32,490
Keeps up like Terry been writing letters,

1446
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,920
by and by we gonna have it good.

1447
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,610
You bet, yes, sir.

1448
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,710
Good thing you read me letters,

1449
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:38,260
or maybe I go get like Chick.

1450
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,400
It's rough, it's plenty rough.

1451
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,730
But we know what's it all about.

1452
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,990
You bet.

1453
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,900
More better we go for broke, yes, Sam?

1454
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,280
- That's about it, Tommy.

1455
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,680
More better we go for broke.

1456
01:17:06,482 --> 01:17:07,585
- Ohhara.

1457
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:08,418
Ohhara!

1458
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:18,663
Is it bad?

1459
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:20,970
- Million-dollar wound.

1460
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,657
Luck of the Irish.

1461
01:17:34,553 --> 01:17:36,187
- Medics!

1462
01:17:36,187 --> 01:17:37,732
Medics!

1463
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:38,565
Medics!

1464
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,310
Let's go!

1465
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,870
- I'm glad you have someone to lean on.

1466
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:11,373
I don't seem to recognize you.

1467
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:13,920
Have you been back to any of the services?

1468
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,753
- No, Father.

1469
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,500
I'm not Catholic.

1470
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,333
- You're not?

1471
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,210
- Different kind of rosary.

1472
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,823
I'm Buddhist, Father.

1473
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,910
- I'll be here if you want me.

1474
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:08,453
- We're gonna try to make contact.

1475
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,113
The Piper Cub's calling
the shots for artillery.

1476
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:18,240
They're trying to shoot
us in some rations.

1477
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,590
- That'll be a big help.

1478
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,773
Sukiyaki and rice.

1479
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,220
- I could use another man.

1480
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,010
- Well, the Piper Cub pilot

1481
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,030
says there's at least
100 of 'em on this ridge.

1482
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,620
And they'll be shooting
right down our throats

1483
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,070
if we try to come up from either side.

1484
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,180
Our engineers have been cutting

1485
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,340
through a road on top of the ridge

1486
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,350
so we can bring up a tank.

1487
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,010
They're about here now.

1488
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,350
But once that tank gets within range—

1489
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,970
- When will that be?

1490
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:46,803
- Hard to say, sir.

1491
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:47,636
It's slow going.

1492
01:19:47,636 --> 01:19:49,390
Minefields all over the place.

1493
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,410
- Tell division headquarters

1494
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,614
I'm on my way back, will you?

1495
01:19:56,953 --> 01:19:58,480
- The Jerries have been
tapping the wires, sir.

1496
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,819
Some of them speak perfect English.

1497
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,483
- Wildcat three.

1498
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:05,460
Wildcat three.

1499
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,743
Sergeant Yasugomoto speaking.

1500
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,800
Wildcat three, this is Wildcat four.

1501
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,950
Come in, Wildcat three.

1502
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,920
Wildcat three.

1503
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:17,753
Wildcat three.

1504
01:20:17,753 --> 01:20:19,780
Sergeant Yasugomoto speaking.

1505
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,700
Wildcat three.

1506
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,533
Wildcat three.

1507
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,839
Sergeant Yasugomoto speaking.

1508
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,440
- Good idea, sergeant.

1509
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,273
- Thank you, sir.

1510
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:30,838
It's just that good old Yankee know-how.

1511
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,657
Watch out!

1512
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,440
- If I was a Jerry on
the end of this ridge

1513
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,677
and a tank got close
enough to fire point-blank,

1514
01:21:36,677 --> 01:21:39,220
I'd take off like a ruptured duck.

1515
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,240
- Yeah.

1516
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,420
- Right over the side of the ridge.

1517
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,310
- There oughta be somebody
down there to meet 'em.

1518
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,760
- That's what I was thinking.

1519
01:21:47,273 --> 01:21:48,190
- Let's go.

1520
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,310
- Hey, sergeant!

1521
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,880
Sergeant!

1522
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,290
Where's Lieutenant Ohhara's platoon?

1523
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:00,180
- This is it.

1524
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,660
- We're your new replacements.

1525
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,820
Ohhara's the name.

1526
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,233
Another suntanned Irishman.

1527
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:07,953
- Come on.

1528
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:23,401
Ohhara!

1529
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:05,521
- They're Japs!

1530
01:24:06,717 --> 01:24:08,967
Hey, knock it off, will ya?

1531
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:12,843
- What's the password?

1532
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,550
- Dipsy doodle, that's it.

1533
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,223
- That was it, a week ago.

1534
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,940
- Let's have that password!

1535
01:24:24,034 --> 01:24:25,313
One.

1536
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:26,380
Two.

1537
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,733
Come on out!

1538
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,910
- Make 'em give you the right password.

1539
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:38,880
- You ever hear a Jerry try

1540
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,360
to pronounce a Japanese word?

1541
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,970
If that's not a buddhahead, I'll...

1542
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,320
You'll what?

1543
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,660
- Sam, Chick, Tommy!

1544
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:50,100
- A whole battalion's lost,
and we gotta find them.

1545
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,220
- Man, I never thought I'd be

1546
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,893
so happy to see a bunch of Japs.

1547
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,350
Pardon me, Japanese.

1548
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,183
I mean, Nisei.

1549
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,140
No, that ain't it.

1550
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,557
What is it, Grayson?

1551
01:25:00,557 --> 01:25:01,469
- Buddhaheads.

1552
01:25:01,469 --> 01:25:02,729
Okay, okay.

1553
01:25:09,654 --> 01:25:10,970
- Buddhaheads, huh?

1554
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:11,803
- That's right.

1555
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,980
- He sure is touchy about that.

1556
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,580
One time, he even slugged me.

1557
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,790
- Slugged you, huh?

1558
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,010
Did you hear that, Chick?

1559
01:25:23,873 --> 01:25:26,230
Where's the rest of
your outfit, lieutenant?

1560
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,700
- Back there about a mile.

1561
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,050
But it took us hours to get here.

1562
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,790
On our bellies, most of the way.

1563
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,300
When do we start?

1564
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,210
- Not enough of us would
make it to do 'em any good.

1565
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,610
- What do we do, lieutenant?

1566
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,810
- That's up to you, Sam.

1567
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,493
I'm strictly a liaison officer.

1568
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:44,490
Skirmish line up the hill.

1569
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,585
Skirmish line up the hill.

1570
01:25:45,585 --> 01:25:47,262
Skirmish line up the hill.

1571
01:25:47,262 --> 01:25:49,022
Skirmish line up the hill.

1572
01:25:49,022 --> 01:25:50,477
Skirmish line up the hill.

1573
01:25:50,477 --> 01:25:52,430
Skirmish line up the hill.

1574
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:53,550
- Tell me something, Sam.

1575
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:56,270
What does mean?

1576
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:00,037
- Well, freely translated: You're a heel.

1577
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,370
A stupid jerk and a heel.

1578
01:26:04,274 --> 01:26:05,747
- That was putting it mildly.

1579
01:26:08,222 --> 01:26:09,972
Go for broke!

1580
01:27:07,773 --> 01:27:09,023
- Go for broke!

1581
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:22,462
Grenade!

1582
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:29,806
Go for broke!

1583
01:27:39,058 --> 01:27:40,558
- Look out, Tommy!

1584
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,323
- Is that all there were?

1585
01:27:53,323 --> 01:27:55,892
- They went thataway, partner.

1586
01:27:55,892 --> 01:27:58,617
Go for broke!

1587
01:28:28,938 --> 01:28:30,521
- Yahoo!

1588
01:28:42,602 --> 01:28:43,983
- Any of you guys want a cigarette?

1589
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,484
Bye, you buddhaheads!

1590
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:54,865
So long!

1591
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:56,710
Ride 'em, cowboy.

1592
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,543
Bye!

1593
01:28:57,543 --> 01:28:58,483
Thanks a lot, Jack.

1594
01:29:00,688 --> 01:29:03,154
See you in Berlin.

1595
01:29:03,154 --> 01:29:04,638
Look out
for that mademoiselle.

1596
01:29:04,638 --> 01:29:05,962
Take it easy.

1597
01:29:05,962 --> 01:29:07,000
So long.

1598
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,833
- Thanks.

1599
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,293
- Goodbye, you all.

1600
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:17,476
So long.

1601
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:20,276
- I'll be seein' ya.

1602
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:21,133
- Aloha, partner!

1603
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,190
Battle honors.

1604
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,600
By order of the secretary of war,

1605
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,495
in the name of the President
of the United States,

1606
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:06,900
as public evidence of deserved
honor and distinction,

1607
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,940
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team

1608
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:13,103
is cited for outstanding
accomplishment in combat.

1609
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,400
The gallantry and esprit
de corps displayed

1610
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,610
by their officers and men in bitter action

1611
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,050
against a formidable enemy

1612
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,780
exemplify the finest traditions

1613
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,992
of the Armed Forces of the United States.
