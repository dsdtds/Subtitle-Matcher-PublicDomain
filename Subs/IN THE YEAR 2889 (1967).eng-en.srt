1
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:05,78
That's what. I.

2
00:00:07,34 --> 00:00:09,41
Thought.

3
00:00:42,37 --> 00:00:42,71
When you.

4
00:01:43,15 --> 00:01:49,19
Are out of the Studio sixty. Six times.

5
00:01:52,48 --> 00:01:56,76
Through the ages of. Hours.

6
00:01:59,81 --> 00:02:06,60
By the destructive power. That is cut
off communication with the outside.

7
00:02:08,06 --> 00:02:14,21
Just fifteen hours after
the first. World has been

8
00:02:14,22 --> 00:02:20,64
a silo. And I awaited my nuclear bomb
three billion people murdered by

9
00:02:20,65 --> 00:02:23,12
a thousand nuclear bombs and

10
00:02:23,13 --> 00:02:29,85
a lethal. Baby there's no one left
to hear my voice living human

11
00:02:29,86 --> 00:02:36,02
being to record the end of
the world. Now this is Ted

12
00:02:36,60 --> 00:02:37,41
Johnson for

13
00:02:37,99 --> 00:03:21,72
a change. Lost

14
00:03:22,06 --> 00:03:28,26
their Our last. Sign of life. Paris Moscow

15
00:03:29,18 --> 00:03:30,22
was quiet now.

16
00:03:37,55 --> 00:03:38,16
It's holding

17
00:03:38,17 --> 00:03:55,35
a forty seven. We may be saved
just as I planned it. I'm

18
00:03:55,36 --> 00:04:01,04
sorry honey I'm afraid he didn't
make it. But there's always hope.

19
00:04:02,34 --> 00:04:03,35
Let's go inside.

20
00:04:29,59 --> 00:04:36,45
And it right Joanna. From
any city. Like that the

21
00:04:36,46 --> 00:04:38,90
radiation and provisions
for the three of us.

22
00:04:44,73 --> 00:04:50,26
I need. I couldn't very well order there
eight to come out here and stay with this

23
00:04:50,64 --> 00:04:52,26
even though you are engaged to him.

24
00:05:00,01 --> 00:05:02,15
Don't you did Larry even know or.

25
00:05:08,32 --> 00:05:15,24
Don't open the door and you go sure it's
very very hectic you compare me now. To

26
00:05:15,74 --> 00:05:21,81
open door went and picked.
Come. Back up to.

27
00:05:28,04 --> 00:05:33,89
Waist don't touch it read up with
radioactivity it's not Larry.

28
00:05:37,25 --> 00:05:40,82
Everyone wait we'd better
check the governor.

29
00:05:54,33 --> 00:06:01,06
Written for you mention he still
breathing. He should be dead

30
00:06:02,03 --> 00:06:05,45
but he's still breathing nobody
can take that much and still live

31
00:06:09,92 --> 00:06:16,58
Don't touch him it's my responsibility. Or

32
00:06:16,59 --> 00:06:21,59
you are my brother. We've.

33
00:06:23,69 --> 00:06:26,21
Made your. Springs from.

34
00:06:31,39 --> 00:06:38,19
The storm. He's still alive you
must be dying. The college

35
00:06:38,20 --> 00:06:43,26
filled seven hundred forty
ranch and. Was a bit of

36
00:06:43,69 --> 00:06:49,77
a storm coming from you know the state
here still turns but they're going to not

37
00:06:49,78 --> 00:06:56,34
only that it's too late
for them but not as. More

38
00:06:56,09 --> 00:06:56,34
and.

39
00:07:05,99 --> 00:07:07,41
And

40
00:07:26,85 --> 00:07:26,85
.

41
00:07:32,44 --> 00:07:38,48
Why. Why

42
00:07:39,21 --> 00:07:42,65

43
00:07:42,66 --> 00:07:54,57
whorl

00:07:54,57 --> 00:07:59,49
. The.

45
00:08:00,89 --> 00:08:08,20
War

00:08:18,88 --> 00:08:25,03
For. Her

48
00:08:25,11 --> 00:08:31,22
better or worse the Iraq lawsuit is

49
00:08:31,23 --> 00:08:37,33
a girl that your boy was all aboard.
While. This does all of the.

50
00:08:38,45 --> 00:08:45,41
Arab stuff the the. Lawn of
the little girl I like is

51
00:08:45,42 --> 00:08:51,32
the. Right.

52
00:08:53,11 --> 00:08:59,100
Yes yes. Of course the last day
I had the only three people my

53
00:09:00,01 --> 00:09:02,31
where stays up to get the sob story.

54
00:09:06,90 --> 00:09:11,25
You can stay here or this is the way I
planned it I had the belief of three people

55
00:09:11,26 --> 00:09:18,03
only. Please

56
00:09:18,04 --> 00:09:20,57
continue to support America
to confession for.

57
00:11:25,73 --> 00:11:31,90
Ways. I didn't mean us and
I was just looking C.B.

58
00:11:31,91 --> 00:11:36,72
No one was alive in the house
What's your name I'm Jim Anderson

59
00:11:36,73 --> 00:11:42,80
a great driver from the
cliff so I rest yes sure

60
00:11:44,29 --> 00:11:51,08
my. Right hand I knock you down
and one of the house you know the

61
00:11:51,09 --> 00:11:57,93
cat stays oh that there

62
00:11:57,94 --> 00:12:00,66
was this all could stay we're
all going to die anyway.

63
00:12:17,32 --> 00:12:23,45
It looks like we're stuck with each other
so let's understand the rules oh I'm the

64
00:12:23,46 --> 00:12:30,15
ranking officer I mean person I mean
the man if we're both I vote for me

65
00:12:31,38 --> 00:12:38,36
I will be fine and this is serious
shadow job and my second in

66
00:12:38,37 --> 00:12:44,88
command will be Steve. This cumber
is registering forty seven mentions

67
00:12:45,23 --> 00:12:50,97
of radioactivity now fifty is considered
dangerous five hundred people but that

68
00:12:50,98 --> 00:12:53,87
depends on the individual different people
have different absorption rates and

69
00:12:53,88 --> 00:12:58,68
capacities we may well we may not there's

70
00:12:58,69 --> 00:13:04,43
a lot we don't know about it some of us may
be dying now. How long we probably can

71
00:13:04,44 --> 00:13:10,14
leave them yeah I got some things working
for me knowing big things so how long

72
00:13:10,15 --> 00:13:15,84
before we can get. New life
forms will move us into

73
00:13:15,85 --> 00:13:22,77
a stupid kid. I don't believe. In your
reading or long or short role for

74
00:13:22,78 --> 00:13:28,55
me and I'm sitting in the room she's right
the six of us in this house may be the

75
00:13:28,56 --> 00:13:29,70
beginning of a new era

76
00:13:30,44 --> 00:13:36,90
a new civilization seven my brother
still alive but not for long I'm afraid

77
00:13:38,01 --> 00:13:42,52
but be that as it may I spent ten
years getting ready for this day

78
00:13:49,30 --> 00:13:55,81
a preview as to why we're still
alive this is my house with its own

79
00:13:55,82 --> 00:14:02,27
generators and food supply these clips
surrounding the house on three sides

80
00:14:02,73 --> 00:14:04,91
are full of lead bearing art that acts as

81
00:14:04,92 --> 00:14:11,70
a barrier against radioactivity the
lake here on the port side is heated

82
00:14:12,10 --> 00:14:18,34
from an underground heat source
probably know about Cain or are maybe

83
00:14:18,35 --> 00:14:23,55
a crack in the earth's crust anyway the
warm air from the lakes waters creates an

84
00:14:23,56 --> 00:14:25,27
updraft and

85
00:14:25,28 --> 00:14:31,69
a strong enough I might add to carry
radioactive contamination out of the valley as

86
00:14:31,70 --> 00:14:37,81
long as it doesn't rain if the rains come
too soon we'll all be contaminated and

87
00:14:37,82 --> 00:14:44,30
die that is if we don't let other
forces destroy us before that time

88
00:14:45,15 --> 00:14:50,93
what other forces Nevermind that now but
make no mistake about it you're not

89
00:14:50,94 --> 00:14:56,40
welcome here. This was planned for just
three people that's how much food we have

90
00:14:57,14 --> 00:15:01,67
if we divide that among the six of us will
soon have empty stomachs and rebellion

91
00:15:04,00 --> 00:15:09,77
I have the keys to the store room I and I
alone will say when and how much food we

92
00:15:09,78 --> 00:15:16,67
eat and the argument about that and
I'll settle it with this oh you're

93
00:15:16,68 --> 00:15:23,34
a big man back in that gun just don't
you let go of it I don't intend to

94
00:15:26,00 --> 00:15:30,60
where you going with that my brother
save the food your brother is

95
00:15:30,61 --> 00:15:37,51
a coward the face that picked up
two men that had never seen you

96
00:15:37,52 --> 00:15:42,55
like this before with ten kind of animals
we're still human and we've got to act

97
00:15:42,56 --> 00:15:46,97
like it it's just what I'm
afraid of their argument

98
00:15:48,65 --> 00:15:50,77
why.

99
00:16:00,71 --> 00:16:06,90
Bring your I don't. I'm not going to die.

100
00:16:08,87 --> 00:16:15,71
But I was not I'm the one that. Says
America you so upset on mentions

101
00:16:16,31 --> 00:16:22,10
I don't understand it's I'm glad you got
something I don't want that I need fresh

102
00:16:22,11 --> 00:16:29,05
meat raw meat. When you're
in with the chef. Over

103
00:16:30,04 --> 00:16:36,48
I think it would be good. Fun to watch him
getting something cause I'm not no water

104
00:16:36,48 --> 00:16:41,44
. Just just let me rest. Will be OK with.

105
00:16:44,96 --> 00:16:51,08
Him. You can tell me how you do happen
to be near this valley yesterday

106
00:16:52,01 --> 00:16:57,61
we're not exactly on the main highway we're
camped on the other side of the lake

107
00:16:58,33 --> 00:17:03,84
that's not too far off the highway. There
on a regular morning was going to be

108
00:17:03,85 --> 00:17:10,45
a get to sleep that they had their own car
wouldn't stop leaders friend you know

109
00:17:10,46 --> 00:17:17,25
who love Mary she's an old

110
00:17:17,26 --> 00:17:21,46
friend of the fan look if you can be

111
00:17:21,47 --> 00:17:28,45
a friend of my family any time you walk.
Out of there before my eyes then. I'm

112
00:17:28,46 --> 00:17:29,08
manager.

113
00:17:40,82 --> 00:17:47,46
I mean. I can see the stock.
Now you know I can't work with

114
00:17:47,47 --> 00:17:54,40
a fan. That's looking at.

115
00:17:55,67 --> 00:18:02,63
It about. My fiance he was
supposed to be yesterday.

116
00:18:07,92 --> 00:18:13,57
Going to marry. Her So I. Really say.

117
00:18:25,38 --> 00:18:25,72
That's not.

118
00:18:37,99 --> 00:18:44,84
A rule come. To. My

119
00:18:44,85 --> 00:18:49,67
snap out of it. Let's go your father's store
and see if we can find some can be for

120
00:18:49,68 --> 00:18:56,57
my brother Steve some of the out what if
the radioactive the outside. Perhaps I

121
00:18:56,58 --> 00:18:57,35
will become big.

122
00:19:13,01 --> 00:19:19,22
How we do enjoy. It forty nine
That's up to since last night

123
00:19:22,84 --> 00:19:27,04
this is just some magic forces holding those
clowns about of this family that's the

124
00:19:27,05 --> 00:19:32,40
warm air from the lake creates an updraft
this I know but we also told you this

125
00:19:32,41 --> 00:19:33,75
morning I've known about this valley for

126
00:19:33,76 --> 00:19:38,67
a long time and Blake to read about
it in college in geology. Will you

127
00:19:38,68 --> 00:19:41,70
a geologist I work for a company about

128
00:19:41,71 --> 00:19:45,45
a hundred miles south of here then you
just didn't stumble in here yesterday by

129
00:19:45,46 --> 00:19:52,26
accident no my brother I had it here the
minute we heard about the bombings smart

130
00:19:52,27 --> 00:19:58,97
thinking on your part you know

131
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:06,44
the real force of the atom has never been
fully calculated I think it reaches the

132
00:20:06,45 --> 00:20:11,100
film yesterday yes but only as we know it
affects our present form of life our life

133
00:20:12,01 --> 00:20:17,51
as we knew it before this nuclear inferno
cover the US You think some other form of

134
00:20:17,52 --> 00:20:22,72
life could have survived I'm only saying
that it's true force has never been fully

135
00:20:22,73 --> 00:20:29,72
understood Are you confusing me now General
do you remember the age bomb test match

136
00:20:29,73 --> 00:20:36,50
still some years ago sure I kept in one of
those ships five days after the blast I

137
00:20:36,51 --> 00:20:40,37
told the animal ship out of targets
the role the outside world never had

138
00:20:40,38 --> 00:20:43,63
a true account of the test what
are you trying to say John.

139
00:20:47,15 --> 00:20:51,00
Coyotes in the daytime. Must be

140
00:20:51,01 --> 00:20:57,01
a lot of game in this valley now contaminated
game fighting for life just the way

141
00:20:57,02 --> 00:20:57,35
we're.

142
00:21:53,85 --> 00:21:59,97
Smatter Granger. There's a live game
outside I can tell this we heard

143
00:21:59,98 --> 00:22:06,94
a coyote during the day I can feel it
and I'll be beat Granger that that

144
00:22:06,95 --> 00:22:13,28
game contaminated game that
you've done I you would die. Me.

145
00:22:20,87 --> 00:22:27,33
I can be that can joke I've got to have
some meat fresh beer that's all you're

146
00:22:27,34 --> 00:22:27,87
going to get for

147
00:22:27,88 --> 00:22:34,57
a long time that's what you think
that's just what you think.

148
00:22:39,20 --> 00:22:41,24
The only.

149
00:22:47,06 --> 00:22:48,54
Just.

150
00:22:59,40 --> 00:23:01,11
I'm. Just.

151
00:23:20,44 --> 00:23:22,70
The poor.

152
00:23:27,39 --> 00:23:28,50
Just.

153
00:23:42,93 --> 00:23:47,57
For three weeks I thought we'd all be
dead by now even Granger got out of bed

154
00:23:47,58 --> 00:23:54,11
yesterday. I was your brother before.

155
00:23:56,45 --> 00:24:01,43
Well he did give me a funny feeling like

156
00:24:01,44 --> 00:24:07,83
a cliche have been dead long ago but there's
no such thing as logic getting more so

157
00:24:07,84 --> 00:24:12,45
logical about my brother you know what
it was like he hasn't taken the water in

158
00:24:12,46 --> 00:24:18,35
three weeks not since he's been here. He
doesn't need and last night he stepped out

159
00:24:18,36 --> 00:24:25,31
of the aisle to didn't come back until
dawn radiation of the fact that his mind

160
00:24:25,88 --> 00:24:29,08
is a mutation Steve face it is

161
00:24:29,09 --> 00:24:52,73
a freak of if you will
comic world about. I'm

162
00:24:52,74 --> 00:24:56,28
going outside. For

163
00:24:56,29 --> 00:25:02,33
a walk. While I don't go
too far stay inside about.

164
00:25:04,34 --> 00:25:10,71
Why. Because I will face all
the five. Hundred high range

165
00:25:11,02 --> 00:25:16,58
anymore sleep I'm not. I'm not
afraid of anything out there.

166
00:25:19,35 --> 00:25:23,72
I like it. Would you like to go with.

167
00:25:48,91 --> 00:25:55,25
Room. I think is dangerous.

168
00:25:56,50 --> 00:25:59,16
Things should be destroyed.

169
00:26:03,30 --> 00:26:10,00
Destroyed my brother. Yes for our
safety you can't do that young

170
00:26:10,20 --> 00:26:15,64
not just because he's my brother but don't
you think it's important as. I don't see

171
00:26:15,65 --> 00:26:20,99
why. I'm sure your. Studies.

172
00:26:29,72 --> 00:26:33,48
If it does rain in the next few weeks I
think we're gonna live somehow I knew we

173
00:26:33,49 --> 00:26:38,96
wouldn't die my father always seems about
it you know right after the bombs came I

174
00:26:38,97 --> 00:26:45,05
didn't much care if I lived or died
don't talk like that it's true Joanna

175
00:26:48,09 --> 00:26:49,79
but these past few weeks with you

176
00:26:59,32 --> 00:27:00,60
now I feel I've got

177
00:27:00,61 --> 00:27:06,56
a big reason to live me Tuesday Joanna.

178
00:27:20,70 --> 00:27:26,98
What's wrong. Did I misunderstand.
I'm sure you're right there was.

179
00:27:29,55 --> 00:27:35,65
Something out there that's things feeling
sound something stronger than the last

180
00:27:35,66 --> 00:27:42,11
time I felt it was just some harmless
animal in the bushes that's all now we stay

181
00:27:42,62 --> 00:27:46,26
the more let's go back
in the house please.

182
00:27:55,43 --> 00:27:59,23
The bank

183
00:27:59,24 --> 00:28:05,03
where.

184
00:28:07,88 --> 00:28:13,65
Where. The and where.

185
00:28:20,27 --> 00:28:26,92
The prayer

186
00:28:26,93 --> 00:28:34,70
the

187
00:28:34,71 --> 00:28:40,19
the. The person.

188
00:28:52,62 --> 00:28:57,45
The

189
00:28:57,46 --> 00:29:02,27
Boron

190
00:29:02,54 --> 00:29:05,50
nightmare.

191
00:29:11,05 --> 00:29:12,43
But.

192
00:29:35,47 --> 00:29:35,96
It was just

193
00:29:35,97 --> 00:29:43,60
a list of their footprints
the Grangers you

194
00:29:43,61 --> 00:29:49,28
think he ate that rabbit he must that he
spends most of his nights prowling around

195
00:29:49,29 --> 00:29:56,10
in these woods forty nine

196
00:29:56,11 --> 00:30:02,84
mentions nothing Commandery that poisoned
me to no avail. No no human could

197
00:30:03,72 --> 00:30:07,63
decries all the miles of
man and God. There may be

198
00:30:07,64 --> 00:30:13,52
a new set of laws JOHN LAWS proportionately
are right nothing about the mountain

199
00:30:13,53 --> 00:30:18,51
and Steve say what you mean we're only
guessing but we know the risk low amounts of

200
00:30:18,52 --> 00:30:21,38
radiation can produce
change now for some reason

201
00:30:21,39 --> 00:30:24,27
a man could survive complete saturation

202
00:30:25,01 --> 00:30:28,36
a thousand generations of change could
take place in a matter of weeks

203
00:30:31,51 --> 00:30:32,18
a match to

204
00:30:32,19 --> 00:30:38,64
a test what you mean nothing go on with
the theory afraid they're more Granger's

205
00:30:38,65 --> 00:30:44,03
out here and even worse than him all of
us have survived more tumors of exposure

206
00:30:44,04 --> 00:30:50,74
than we ever thought possible you are
mean we only become like your brother

207
00:30:50,95 --> 00:30:56,92
stocking these words at night eating raw
meat possible keep right theories as to

208
00:30:56,93 --> 00:31:03,91
what to do in the Situation. You know
my brother couldn't find the answer

209
00:31:03,92 --> 00:31:09,57
to something he looked it up in the Bible
he believed that it held the answers to

210
00:31:09,58 --> 00:31:14,61
everything where I am
would be to save B.N.

211
00:31:14,62 --> 00:31:21,31
Deliver the say at the LORD I will
deliver the the back and of the

212
00:31:21,32 --> 00:31:28,21
wicked. I will redeem the out of
the land of the terrible I had

213
00:31:28,22 --> 00:31:29,74
enough of that Bible when I was

214
00:31:29,75 --> 00:31:34,04
a kid it's easy to see it
had no effect on you make.

215
00:31:37,74 --> 00:31:38,79
An ego for Granger.

216
00:31:47,30 --> 00:31:54,16
What was it. Maybe you better tell us

217
00:31:54,17 --> 00:32:00,55
what the Bible says about rain in our
situation we had better pray that it doesn't

218
00:32:00,56 --> 00:32:06,20
rain not for weeks anyway because if it
does rain in this valley it will be coming

219
00:32:06,21 --> 00:32:13,18
down through clouds saturated with
nuclear death. Maybe we'll be safe like

220
00:32:13,19 --> 00:32:19,10
no in the Iraq right now there's about
forty wrenches of activity in this room if

221
00:32:19,11 --> 00:32:22,29
it rains that will move up into
the hundreds of branches in

222
00:32:22,30 --> 00:32:29,17
a matter of hours and we'll all be
dead are like Granger around lucky

223
00:32:29,99 --> 00:32:36,19
but maybe the other grass from the
lake will hold the clouds back forward

224
00:32:37,10 --> 00:32:43,21
we've been lucky so far. I can see
that I hope you're right sweetheart

225
00:32:44,23 --> 00:32:48,78
and if the weather does clear starting
tomorrow we'll have to go on half rations

226
00:32:50,69 --> 00:32:56,46
how much is half of nothing I've stored
some seeds and grain and I have books and

227
00:32:56,53 --> 00:33:03,25
materials on every craft necessary
to sustain my. Mickey Rooney

228
00:33:03,50 --> 00:33:10,45
farmer in Cressman. Another thing we're
about out of fresh water but there's

229
00:33:10,46 --> 00:33:17,42
a spring fed pool not so far from the cliffs
hold your own the biggest one of them

230
00:33:17,43 --> 00:33:24,32
from the start. At least save I checked
it today and starting tomorrow we can

231
00:33:24,33 --> 00:33:31,14
all take turns bathing they're
getting one. Taken in the past two

232
00:33:31,15 --> 00:33:37,36
months and I have an almost more days
together. Maybe that's why you're still alive

233
00:33:37,36 --> 00:33:41,88
. But

234
00:33:41,89 --> 00:33:49,14
what

235
00:33:49,15 --> 00:33:53,78
my onboard.

236
00:33:57,66 --> 00:34:01,77
Borer

237
00:34:01,78 --> 00:34:14,14
whorls

238
00:34:14,15 --> 00:34:18,52
brain bomb attached to the
letter writing by Facebook

239
00:34:18,53 --> 00:34:23,32
a grange the crowds are going to come in
the valley you're lying to me disco rain

240
00:34:24,07 --> 00:34:29,71
come on. Come back to the house
gonna try to break break.

241
00:34:32,28 --> 00:34:34,96
Break come back to our why.

242
00:34:35,97 --> 00:34:53,76
Why

243
00:34:54,45 --> 00:34:55,75
why.

244
00:34:59,99 --> 00:35:05,66
Why. Why

245
00:35:06,49 --> 00:35:12,31
the band.

246
00:35:27,24 --> 00:35:28,93
Sunshine feels

247
00:35:28,94 --> 00:35:35,73
a Coke can. Quietude. Give anything
to her the downtown traffic again.

248
00:35:37,14 --> 00:35:39,80
I didn't realize how isolated
it would be from the house.

249
00:35:46,21 --> 00:35:52,36
Good looking. Clean cut that. Something.

250
00:35:54,80 --> 00:35:58,33
Maybe. Is all lies you.

251
00:36:01,52 --> 00:36:08,11
Tom. Are interested in.
We better not be rude.

252
00:36:10,52 --> 00:36:12,84
Well what have made

253
00:36:12,85 --> 00:36:17,78
a place where it would
be unfair competition

254
00:36:18,37 --> 00:36:25,23
which whisky always comes back to

255
00:36:25,24 --> 00:36:30,56
Mom white America

256
00:36:30,80 --> 00:36:34,10
when he's like I'm

257
00:36:34,11 --> 00:36:40,75
a point in feeling when I didn't
hear any better or worse something

258
00:36:40,76 --> 00:36:47,50
moving over there in the bush is probably
one of the valid probably Okemah say why

259
00:36:47,51 --> 00:36:54,00
the poor one

260
00:36:54,63 --> 00:36:58,07
when the other let's get out of this

261
00:36:58,40 --> 00:37:04,62
one

262
00:37:08,80 --> 00:37:15,67
. Range is not the only

263
00:37:15,68 --> 00:37:22,15
one hundred games and after they've
finished off the game we'll be next

264
00:37:25,35 --> 00:37:31,16
this place is cursed Steve we've got to get
rid of your brother. Is the only way to

265
00:37:31,17 --> 00:37:37,10
find out what we're up against or just see
that the animals on the ship so much so

266
00:37:37,11 --> 00:37:41,93
Trast. They far warned of something like
this you know you keep mentioning that

267
00:37:41,94 --> 00:37:45,93
you're going to keep up the mystery going
to tell me about it tonight back at the

268
00:37:45,94 --> 00:37:49,31
house I'll show you after the others
have gone to bed I have the evidence

269
00:37:55,64 --> 00:38:01,58
let's look at it you said I didn't see
anything to prove you said it was just my

270
00:38:01,59 --> 00:38:08,50
imagination that's right he just became
upset Steve somebody was looking

271
00:38:08,51 --> 00:38:14,05
at me tried to talk to me but he
said nothing you'd understand

272
00:38:15,80 --> 00:38:20,57
nothing I didn't just for that matter. Where
you were go swimming alone in the pool

273
00:38:20,58 --> 00:38:27,33
any more I'll stand guard my
skin was tingling my pulse was

274
00:38:27,34 --> 00:38:31,61
pounding you're still upset
and I go back the House Steve

275
00:38:34,26 --> 00:38:38,29
do you believe in mental
telepathy. I'm afraid I'm reading

276
00:38:38,30 --> 00:38:45,26
a thought if that's what you mean what
am I thinking it's not the same way you

277
00:38:45,27 --> 00:38:46,02
were thinking about me

278
00:38:46,03 --> 00:38:53,39
a few days ago I'm sorry. I

279
00:38:53,57 --> 00:38:58,25
feel like I'd like to be alone
right now I'm sorry to join

280
00:39:16,07 --> 00:39:21,96
Maybe I don't scare me like that I just
want to talk to you that's all you know I

281
00:39:21,97 --> 00:39:22,62
but I haven't said

282
00:39:22,63 --> 00:39:29,62
a dozen words to you since I got here
and look what's so bad about me I don't

283
00:39:29,63 --> 00:39:32,45
drink I don't smoke and once
I even gave some money to

284
00:39:32,46 --> 00:39:39,44
a drunken bum my old man. And I
don't even hard to get stuff

285
00:39:39,97 --> 00:39:46,86
C'mon. Down you belong to Java I

286
00:39:46,87 --> 00:39:50,28
belong to me did me.

287
00:39:59,81 --> 00:40:05,60
Nobody. Oh it's you must care for days to
some of the best was Can these mountains

288
00:40:05,60 --> 00:40:11,64
. That is lifting words you did it.

289
00:40:12,76 --> 00:40:15,05
Made him oh so that's where I'm

290
00:40:15,06 --> 00:40:25,00
a good little girls back
in my place. Whatever

291
00:40:25,48 --> 00:40:30,78
was. The first taste is
never a good misjudge it's

292
00:40:30,79 --> 00:40:33,34
a long second one that puts her on

293
00:40:33,35 --> 00:40:43,25
a chest. The

294
00:40:43,26 --> 00:40:48,28
air or the bottom of the room.

295
00:40:56,33 --> 00:40:56,78
Where.

296
00:41:04,96 --> 00:41:25,38
The

297
00:41:25,39 --> 00:41:25,94
brain.

298
00:41:40,94 --> 00:41:44,07
Will believe this but I just saw Granger
walk up the mount trail through that

299
00:41:44,08 --> 00:41:50,61
bargain to didn't face it do
you remember anything about

300
00:41:50,62 --> 00:41:51,25
a match to

301
00:41:51,26 --> 00:41:58,05
a bomb test. And they ruined right after
that with. Something I have to show

302
00:41:58,06 --> 00:42:05,01
you. A whole lot my thought was that
all the animals about I get zero

303
00:42:06,12 --> 00:42:13,11
I that of course not all that. Was ever
said they were all destroyed I was lied to

304
00:42:13,12 --> 00:42:18,07
realize that I'm a liberal.
Through an H.-Bomb it was

305
00:42:18,08 --> 00:42:24,76
a lot of taking photographs but no
obligation getting it seem right thousand

306
00:42:24,77 --> 00:42:31,40
animals on that ship.
That was a test mine was

307
00:42:31,41 --> 00:42:34,84
a line has little over three days.

308
00:42:45,23 --> 00:42:46,30
Thirty Survivor was

309
00:42:46,31 --> 00:42:54,38
a monkey its skin looked like rubber
but it felt more like metal armor

310
00:42:54,39 --> 00:43:00,41
plated nature's answer to
complete nuclear radiation that's

311
00:43:00,42 --> 00:43:07,30
a million years of evolution with
one bomb. Within the for three days

312
00:43:07,54 --> 00:43:11,56
when we got back to the inspection ship
they were dead if we could figure out what

313
00:43:11,57 --> 00:43:17,37
killed them and may help us we never knew
after we watched them down we went down

314
00:43:17,38 --> 00:43:23,86
to inspect they were normal except for
their appearance but they refused food and

315
00:43:23,87 --> 00:43:30,86
water new species yes they were

316
00:43:30,87 --> 00:43:36,39
the forerunners of whatever it is
we have out there sometimes I have

317
00:43:36,40 --> 00:43:43,27
a feeling that. I know this
much that two forms of life I

318
00:43:43,40 --> 00:43:49,55
survive on this valley and only one can
win and it's got to be us you know I

319
00:43:49,56 --> 00:43:54,12
started this thing just to
stay alive but you've given me

320
00:43:54,13 --> 00:43:59,12
a deep feeling of responsibility
toward the well man and are I.

321
00:44:04,25 --> 00:44:10,41
Think I'll turn in now and down. As I'll
tell the girls the first thing in the

322
00:44:10,42 --> 00:44:17,32
morning. As. A comparison of
them as soon as possible.

323
00:45:31,24 --> 00:45:37,99
Maybe with the new good
days in the fall. When

324
00:45:38,00 --> 00:45:44,94
Arnold. Stole. My

325
00:45:44,95 --> 00:45:51,74
life. A

326
00:45:51,75 --> 00:45:57,29
sea captain can perform the marriage
ceremony in case of an emergency Joe and I

327
00:45:57,30 --> 00:46:04,27
want you to marry Steve I want
you to have children that we

328
00:46:04,28 --> 00:46:09,04
know wedding God and
know killed and you have

329
00:46:09,05 --> 00:46:14,56
a responsibility to the future what would
mother tell the mother and Larry what

330
00:46:14,57 --> 00:46:18,41
would he fall they're both dead

331
00:46:21,53 --> 00:46:28,52
I mean I mean when are those those
what have you been listening to be

332
00:46:28,73 --> 00:46:35,42
ye that. Are more effective in

333
00:46:35,43 --> 00:46:40,40
a week if he is still alive. And if I.

334
00:46:55,47 --> 00:47:02,42
Were to do another. This little
gadgets that are open that store room

335
00:47:02,43 --> 00:47:09,13
for me. Can you

336
00:47:09,14 --> 00:47:13,35
imagine us having a kid.
Tell him it's mother was

337
00:47:13,36 --> 00:47:20,13
a lot of dancing. I wonder what's
wrong with Joanna Ritchie goes

338
00:47:20,14 --> 00:47:25,27
around own little world now reflect after

339
00:47:25,28 --> 00:47:30,28
a rock or. Maybe we are. Not me baby.

340
00:47:33,40 --> 00:47:39,15
Don't go far don't you you're just playing
dirty to her but you still water.

341
00:47:41,52 --> 00:47:42,73
All I want is

342

427
00:59:52,38 --> 00:59:59,25
a mother gets washed up redone

01:00:46,61 --> 01:00:52,00
look at those pictures.
So I agree Stupak was.

433
01:00:55,11 --> 01:00:59,49
Glass. Said the parent of the
monkey in your drawings.

434
01:01:02,09 --> 01:01:02,47
Matt.

435
01:01:34,58 --> 01:01:41,43
But he was aware of the quick. The doing

436
01:01:41,44 --> 01:01:48,19
to me that's just your imagination
our real life you're the only.

437
01:02:01,66 --> 01:02:08,65
One insists this thing trying to talk
to or I love the way you look. Like

438
01:02:09,31 --> 01:02:15,62
an ape sketches of my soul.
That this thing is man sized

439
01:02:16,51 --> 01:02:23,41
A man not an ape how do we find it
how do we tell it you're the one

440
01:02:23,42 --> 01:02:29,52
who said we've come up with an answer but
how can sound fresh breeze contaminated

441
01:02:29,53 --> 01:02:30,98
there the things that kill

442
01:02:30,99 --> 01:02:37,87
a man drives on. The point you're
driving at some of the just that in

443
01:02:37,88 --> 01:02:42,96
order to kill it we must first understand
it and we know it has fears it was close

444
01:02:42,97 --> 01:02:45,73
enough to join it to attack or
what it would power into the pool.

445
01:03:24,36 --> 01:03:26,15
Don't scream I mean it.

446
