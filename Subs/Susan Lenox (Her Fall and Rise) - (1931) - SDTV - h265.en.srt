1
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,657
I'm afraid you come too late, doctor.

2
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:42,872
Yeah?

3
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,831
We'll see .. we'll see.

4
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,919
The mother is dead.

5
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,074
I think I can save the baby.

6
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,421
Come along, I'll need your help.

7
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,040
I'll need some hot water right away.

8
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:10,964
Doctors shouldn't go
against the will of God.

9
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:14,030
Pray we should die too.
- No, no.

10
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,517
She is a pretty baby, Karl.

11
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:18,645
Your sister, she was pretty too.

12
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,897
And what did it bring her, but disgrace.

13
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:22,436
I tell him now.

14
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,429
Better the baby die too, maybe?

15
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:33,258
The mother, she didn't
have a wedding ring.

16
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,896
It's my business to save lives.

17
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:02,968
Helga.

18
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,014
Get to work there.

19
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:12,898
Helga .. pull off my boot.

20
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,326
Helga .. come here.

21
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:30,177
Helga.

22
00:04:58,361 --> 00:04:59,257
Helga.

23
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,036
You're going to marry Jeb Mondstrum.

24
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,137
I say you are ..
- But she don't hardly know him, Karl.

25
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,687
She had plenty time to get acquainted.

26
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,625
You're not going the way of your mother.

27
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,814
You start out just like her.
Reading novels.

28
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,017
Getting crazy notions in your head.

29
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,660
It ain't going to happen
in my family twice.

30
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,406
But, Karl.
- No.

31
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,555
What's in the blood is there.

32
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,300
No-one can change it.

33
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,254
When I see you married
with a wedding ring ..

34
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:47,342
Then I have done my duty.

35
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:17,941
You can't go out in this storm yet.

36
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,276
Better stay here.

37
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,444
Make yourself at home.

38
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,071
Ah, goodnight.
- Night.

39
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:41,557
Goodnight.

40
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,464
No.

41
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,432
You know .. you are a pretty girl.

42
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:32,316
No.

43
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,316
Helga, you're as good as mine already.

44
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:43,208
Let me go.

45
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,105
Quiet, Major.

46
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:06,991
You're a girl, aren't you?

47
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:08,766
Yes.

48
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,047
What ..?

49
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:11,527
How did you ..?

50
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,206
Come on out.

51
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,726
Please let me stay here.

52
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:17,885
I won't make any trouble.

53
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:20,294
What's the idea? You can't stay in here.

54
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:21,669
Come out, I tell you.

55
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,505
But your dog will bite me.

56
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,359
Nonsense. Major doesn't bite girls.

57
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:29,787
Come on.

58
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:38,081
Say, hurry up will you.
It happens to be raining out here.

59
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:41,278
Where are we going?

60
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:45,261
Where?

61
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,242
Inside.

62
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:52,309
House.

63
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:54,619
You know: house.

64
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,771
Doors, windows, roof.

65
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:58,084
House.

66
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,354
I think I'd better not.

67
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,194
You're not afraid of a house, are you?

68
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,189
Alright. Stay here then.

69
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,330
Wait a minute.

70
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,995
Alright. I'll go with you.

71
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:18,707
Alright. Come on.

72
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:50,381
What's the matter with you?

73
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:53,000
Nothing.

74
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:54,442
Hey, don't kid me.

75
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,785
You'd better take off your clothes.

76
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:07,115
No.

77
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,667
Oh, I didn't mean it that way.

78
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:13,566
I .. I mean you'd better
change your clothes.

79
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,063
You're soaking wet.

80
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:16,931
I'll get you something dry to put on.

81
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,207
I won't be a minute. Just get
warm there by the fire.

82
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,231
Here we are.

83
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,052
Say, what?

84
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,631
Here.

85
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,166
You can wear these.

86
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:47,410
Thank you.

87
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:50,574
Pants.

88
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,279
Yes. Of course.

89
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,524
I haven't worn petticoats for years.

90
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:59,167
You had ..

91
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,827
You'd better go in here and ..

92
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:01,997
Change.

93
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,163
Just throw out your wet clothes
and I'll hang them up to dry.

94
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,022
Well.

95
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:16,283
Say.

96
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:19,904
Who are you anyway?

97
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:26,311
Uhoh.

98
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,865
Never mind. Never mind.

99
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,316
We won't talk about you at all.

100
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,516
No, sir.

101
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:37,011
You know what we'll do?
We'll talk about me.

102
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,825
You know who I am?

103
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,807
No? Well, I'll tell you.

104
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:43,332
I'm Rodney. Mr Spencer's little boy.

105
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,235
I'm thirty, white and unmarried.

106
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,826
I'm really a very fine fellow.

107
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,223
Never unkind to animals
or kicked babies in the teeth.

108
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:51,978
Always courteous when drunk.
This is my old man's cabin.

109
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:53,634
He wanted me to be a lawyer.

110
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,444
So, obedient to his every word
I took a course in engineering.

111
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,065
Opportunity came to me in the guise of
a bridge to be constructed in Detroit.

112
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:01,571
A competition open to all.

113
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,267
I'm here now, working on my model.

114
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,519
After I win the competition I hope
to go on and on and on and ..

115
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:08,504
Carve a great career for myself.

116
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:10,797
Will you have cream or
sugar in your coffee?

117
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:12,264
Yes.

118
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,557
Alright.

119
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:16,274
There you are.

120
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:17,817
One?

121
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:26,972
Caviar?

122
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,064
Is that ..

123
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,363
To eat?

124
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,563
Sure.

125
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:35,873
Well.

126
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:37,752
It looks like ..

127
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:39,332
Like buckshot.

128
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:43,125
Well it isn't. It's fish eggs.

129
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,419
You know. Fish.

130
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:51,376
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

131
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:53,691
We'll have to have a little port.

132
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,177
To warm us up.

133
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:20,602
Skol.

134
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:24,753
Here we go.

135
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:51,067
You poor kid.

136
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:54,987
You're all in, aren't you.

137
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:58,307
You'd better stay here
and get some sleep.

138
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,010
It's alright.

139
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:02,977
I'll take you home in the morning.

140
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:08,847
Well.

141
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,193
I had better go now.

142
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,062
Now listen. You're not going
out in that storm again.

143
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:19,218
No, sir.

144
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:21,181
You're going to stay here.

145
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,561
Look. This is my room.

146
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,003
You can sleep in there.

147
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,281
It's alright. I'll sleep out here.

148
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:28,636
See.

149
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:39,816
There you are.

150
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,991
Well.

151
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:45,753
Goodnight.

152
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:47,922
Goodnight.

153
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:06,754
What are you thinking about?

154
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,756
I was just thinking how nice you are.

155
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:15,032
Okay. Goodnight.

156
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,978
Alright. Alright.

157
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:18,544
Hiya, Major. Hi, boy.

158
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:20,544
How are you, boy?

159
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:43,955
Well, good morning.

160
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:46,294
Good morning.

161
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:47,661
What are you doing?

162
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,317
Getting your breakfast.

163
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:50,468
What?

164
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:51,842
Getting my breakfast?

165
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,545
I should say not.

166
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:57,214
If there's any waiting-on to be done
around here, I'll do the waiting.

167
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:58,573
You sit down there.

168
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,130
You don't know what a good cook I am.

169
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:02,943
I'll take care of this thing.

170
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,505
What happened?
- I burnt myself.

171
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:07,640
Wait a minute.

172
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:09,647
Here.

173
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:11,885
This will fix it.

174
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,123
See.

175
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:21,134
It doesn't hurt now, does it?

176
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:23,150
No.

177
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,804
It doesn't hurt now.

178
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:38,302
Well.

179
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,126
It's morning. I ..

180
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,472
I guess I'd better be going soon.

181
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,227
It's much safer to travel at night.

182
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:55,475
Come on.

183
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:57,243
Stick around here with me today.

184
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,232
We'll just forget about everything.

185
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:00,701
We'll have a lot of fun.

186
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:02,175
Huh?

187
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:04,269
Ah, sure you will.

188
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,794
Tell you what we'll do.
We'll go fishing.

189
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,244
Have you ever been fishing?
- No.

190
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,323
What?

191
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,358
Say, you don't know what you've missed.

192
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:16,362
There's the grandest little spot
right down here with fish like ..

193
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:18,747
And do they bite?

194
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:21,305
Oh, come on.

195
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,799
Say you'll stay.

196
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:24,627
Will you?

197
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:26,017
Well.

198
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:27,699
Of course you will.

199
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:29,659
I don't know.

200
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:47,468
Don't shake it around like that.

201
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:50,225
You'll never catch one that way.
Hold it still.

202
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,671
Hey.

203
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:59,110
I've got a bite.

204
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:00,687
Alright, haul it in.

205
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,587
Where did he go?

206
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:08,683
Up in that tree.

207
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:10,365
Where?
- Here, here.

208
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:11,972
I'll get him for you.

209
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:13,324
Here.

210
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:16,675
Quiet, Major.

211
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:17,674
My fish.

212
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,242
You exaggerate.
- Let me hold him.

213
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,740
Wait a minute.
I'll get him off the hook for you.

214
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:24,493
Let me hold him.

215
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:26,800
Here you are.

216
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:30,291
He's gone. Where is he?

217
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:31,847
Here he is. Here he is.

218
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,803
There he is.
- Yes.

219
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,032
Little fish.

220
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,550
I'm going to cook him
for your supper tonight.

221
00:24:12,306 --> 00:24:14,293
Hey, hurry up. We haven't much time.

222
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:15,664
Coming.

223
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:27,577
Did you bring my shaving things?

224
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,488
Come on.

225
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:36,628
Now the brush.

226
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:46,208
And the soap.

227
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:48,860
Did you bring the soap?

228
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:50,370
Soap?

229
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,745
You don't expect me to shave
without soap, do you?

230
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:54,802
You mean 'soap'?

231
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:02,512
Give me that soap.

232
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:04,395
Give me that soap.

233
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,678
Come on now. Give me that soap.

234
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:10,727
Hey, quit stalling. You'll
make me miss my train.

235
00:25:11,394 --> 00:25:12,488
Give me that soap.

236
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:15,599
Now I've got you.

237
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:17,079
You bad girl.

238
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,018
Are you going to be good?

239
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:19,970
Are you?

240
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:21,216
Huh?

241
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,066
Yes.

242
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,731
Do you call that being good?

243
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,823
Huh?

244
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,036
Gee, I don't want to go, darling.

245
00:25:49,972 --> 00:25:50,873
But I have to.

246
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,578
These drawings have to be in.

247
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,853
The competition closes in three days.

248
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,158
You understand that? Don't you?

249
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:04,676
And after all.

250
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:06,686
Six days isn't long to wait.

251
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,298
Is it?

252
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:09,803
No.

253
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:11,846
Not very.

254
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:14,706
Alright.

255
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,120
Come now, and help me finish packing.

256
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:27,834
You forgot these.

257
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,322
Oh yes.

258
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:33,406
You want these with you, don't you?

259
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:34,536
Sure.

260
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,261
Say.

261
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,626
Your father and mother.
Do you think they will like me?

262
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,193
Like you?

263
00:26:43,764 --> 00:26:45,019
I should say they will.

264
00:26:48,219 --> 00:26:50,010
I never had a picture of my mother.

265
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:53,892
I guess she never had one taken.

266
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:57,786
Just like.

267
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,068
Like she never had a ring.

268
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,502
Oh, Rodney.

269
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:18,436
I know now. It was untrue all the
things my uncle said about her.

270
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:23,276
About her not being good
because she didn't have a ring.

271
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:27,567
But you're going to have a ring, Helga.

272
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,524
I'm bringing one back with me.

273
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,041
Everything alright now?

274
00:27:40,938 --> 00:27:41,636
Yes.

275
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:48,211
Say, I got to go.

276
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:51,375
Sure. But I'll be back
before you know it.

277
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,582
Yep.

278
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,766
You take good care of
yourself while I'm gone.

279
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:55,897
Eat lots.

280
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:57,771
Get plenty of good sleep.

281
00:27:58,439 --> 00:27:59,740
Don't set fire to the house.

282
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:01,942
And don't take any wooden nickels.

283
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,717
Alright. Now we're ready. Come on.

284
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,553
Say, you forgot your bridge.

285
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:11,973
Yeah, the bridge. The most important
thing of all. Can you bring it?

286
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,354
Yes.
- Alright.

287
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,720
This is as far as you'd
better go, darling.

288
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:25,778
Goodbye.

289
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:27,580
Goodbye.

290
00:28:31,652 --> 00:28:33,439
Be good. It won't be long.

291
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:37,095
Goodbye, Major. Bye-bye boy.

292
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,619
Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye.

293
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:50,874
Come along, Major.

294
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:44,500
You're going back with us.

295
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:46,113
No.

296
00:29:46,687 --> 00:29:47,968
I say you are.

297
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:49,633
No, no.

298
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:51,260
You're going back now.

299
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:54,368
Come with me.
- No.

300
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:56,724
Did you hear me? You're going back now.

301
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:58,202
I don't want to.

302
00:30:48,684 --> 00:30:49,907
All aboard.

303
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:51,751
All aboard.

304
00:31:19,363 --> 00:31:20,848
Say, shut that door.

305
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:25,693
I was trying to get out.

306
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,136
With the train going
thirty miles an hour?

307
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:29,948
Give me a cigarette.

308
00:31:30,336 --> 00:31:32,210
And a match. And a match.

309
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,651
Come on, come on. What are you doing?

310
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:40,056
I'm out.
- I'm out.

311
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:41,743
Four more.

312
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,513
Yeah? Here's your four, and four better.

313
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,744
Come again.
- Yeah?

314
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,282
I'll just tap you.

315
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:53,363
What have you got?
- Four bones of fire.

316
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,144
That's good.
- I'll say it's good.

317
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:59,968
Hey Suzie, come here a minute.

318
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,395
Stick around. You brought me luck.

319
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,309
That's the best hand I've had
since Sitting Bull sat down.

320
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:06,995
Sit down.

321
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:09,105
It's alright kid, sit down.

322
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:11,923
What's your name, kid?

323
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,158
Never mind. Meet the joint.

324
00:32:15,177 --> 00:32:15,858
Hello.

325
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:22,128
Hello, Frenchy.
- Hello, Coco.

326
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:24,455
Hello, Burly.
- Hiya, Burly.

327
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,157
Hello Eva.
- Hello, Burly.

328
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,311
Who's winning?

329
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:29,477
For a change.

330
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:30,516
Yeah?

331
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:36,328
Who are you?

332
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,421
This is Suzie.

333
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:40,316
Suzie?
- Yes.

334
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,402
Miss ..

335
00:32:42,371 --> 00:32:43,667
Miss Lenox of Lenoxville.

336
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:45,496
She caught this train by mistake.

337
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,163
You can get off at the next stop.

338
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:50,809
How much does it cost to go to Detroit?

339
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,134
Thirty-three berries.

340
00:33:00,096 --> 00:33:01,203
You broke, kid?

341
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,425
I understand. I ran away once myself.

342
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,217
Give me two.

343
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:10,586
Say, Burly.
- Huh?

344
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:14,327
You know the beauty that ditched Alf
this afternoon and married a bootlegger?

345
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,750
Why don't you let Suzie take her place?

346
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:19,455
I never thought of that.

347
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:22,638
Stand up. Let me see what you look like.

348
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:28,629
Not bad.
- Not bad? She's okay.

349
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,298
Think she'll work alright?
- Sure.

350
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,442
Alright, Pansy. Have the
wardrobe woman fix her up.

351
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:37,563
Uhoh, uncle. Come back with the ante.

352
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:40,988
I guess you got some that way once.
- You can never tell.

353
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:47,379
Hi, Suzie.
- Hello.

354
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:49,393
Where you been?
- To post something.

355
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:50,683
Oh?

356
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,490
I suppose you mailed
another letter to that guy?

357
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:54,663
Yes.

358
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,945
I told him I'll meet him at Marquette.

359
00:33:58,391 --> 00:33:59,921
What makes you think he'll be there?

360
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:02,501
He'll be there.

361
00:34:04,023 --> 00:34:04,820
Suzie.

362
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,101
Come here a minute, will you.
I want to talk to you.

363
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,168
Suzie.

364
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:19,449
Do you happen to know a
man by the name of ..

365
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:22,502
Jeb Mondstrum or Mardstrum?

366
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:25,177
No.

367
00:34:26,056 --> 00:34:26,722
Okay.

368
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:47,910
Now don't worry, Suzie. I ..

369
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,709
I told him there wasn't anyone around
here who answered your description.

370
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,477
You had better not show today.

371
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,071
Just keep under cover until
we pull out of town tonight.

372
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:02,278
The ..

373
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,677
The Sheriff told me they're
watching all the outgoing trains.

374
00:35:06,157 --> 00:35:07,501
Now, I can't stop them.

375
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,977
But I don't think they'll
search my private compartment.

376
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:15,217
So we'll fool them. You be
there when we leave tonight.

377
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:23,993
Oh, hello Sheriff.

378
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:26,661
Have any luck? Did you find her?

379
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:28,899
No, but we ain't finished
with them beauties yet.

380
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,202
Did you try looking in the wagon car?

381
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:32,674
We'll look alright.

382
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:34,682
Good luck.
- Thanks.

383
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:57,063
Thank you.

384
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,266
Right up this way folks,
for the dancing girls.

385
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,631
The show starts right away, folks.

386
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:50,552
Next, I present for your
approval, Major Crumb.

387
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,712
One of the strongest
people in the world.

388
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:57,647
Would you believe that when he was only
18 years old he was over six feet tall.

389
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,515
But later in life he got
married and settled down.

390
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:05,092
Just over here, the ladies from Arabia.

391
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:08,526
And then, from Arabia,
the tattooed lady.

392
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:10,331
Why, folks.

393
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:14,661
One tour of this little lady's anatomy
brings before your very eyes ..

394
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:16,843
Some of the most marvellous
features of the world.

395
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,957
For instance, on this limb here ..

396
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,760
We have the Eiffel Tower.

397
00:37:22,149 --> 00:37:24,540
Get at eyeful of that and you
don't have to go to Paris.

398
00:37:25,824 --> 00:37:29,096
On this limb right here we
have the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

399
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,635
Make it lean, madam.

400
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:32,748
I said lean, not fall.

401
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,626
Across the little lady's back.

402
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,863
We have a panoramic representation
of the Statue of Liberty.

403
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:42,048
But here's one statue you
cannot take liberties with.

404
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:43,970
Look at, but do not touch.

405
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:46,376
Across the little lady's torso.

406
00:37:46,851 --> 00:37:48,695
I said, across her torso.

407
00:37:49,169 --> 00:37:51,048
We find the Atlantic Fleet.

408
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:52,848
In action.

409
00:37:53,823 --> 00:37:55,745
What's that? Show you Chicago?

410
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,885
Listen, brother. This is an
exhibition, not a Cook's tour.

411
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:02,434
That will be all, madam.
Now on the next platform here.

412
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:06,885
Right this way folks, can I draw
your special attention to this ..

413
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:10,518
Platform right here which has
the beauties of all nations.

414
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:12,355
Right here, folks.

415
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,271
On your toes, you canaries.

416
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:16,740
First I present for your approval.

417
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:19,164
Miss Hula from Bermuda.

418
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:21,544
From the sandy beaches of Waikiki.

419
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,759
Bombay Beulah from India.

420
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:37,768
Well?

421
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,708
If you don't like it, what do
you keep on looking for?

422
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:42,676
I'm sorry.

423
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:46,832
But they told me I
could find Miss .. Miss ..

424
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:48,857
You ain't ..?
- My name is Spencer.

425
00:38:49,616 --> 00:38:50,561
Rodney Spencer.

426
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,462
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr Spencer.

427
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,190
My name is Madame Panoramia.

428
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:56,411
They call me 'Pansy' for short.

429
00:38:57,214 --> 00:38:58,115
How do you do.

430
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,949
She may be a little dark, boys. But she
will be a bright spot in your memories.

431
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:05,448
Now folks.

432
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,554
For the sensation of all sensations.

433
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:12,233
And last but not least the
attraction of all attractions.

434
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:14,595
I wish to present for your approval.

435
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:16,491
The Belle Zedema.

436
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,116
The favorite of the Sultan of Turkey.

437
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:23,642
But she escaped and
his loss is your gain.

438
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:27,563
If he finds her I shudder to
think of the consequences.

439
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:30,626
For when she dances, every muscle ..

440
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:33,261
Every fibre in this
little lady's body ..

441
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:37,833
Sends out high voltage that
will more than electrify you.

442
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:42,378
I'll ask the little lady to retire and
prepare for her sensational dance.

443
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:43,759
As promised, folks.

444
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,689
I'm going to have the little lady
from Honolulu dance for you.

445
00:39:46,997 --> 00:39:48,641
Alright Pop, let's have a little music.

446
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,759
Take it away, lady. Come on.

447
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:05,697
Rodney.

448
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:15,535
Well.

449
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:17,835
I'll be seeing you, Suzie.

450
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:20,391
Rodney.

451
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:36,734
It's nice to see you.

452
00:40:37,623 --> 00:40:38,884
It's been so long.

453
00:40:40,867 --> 00:40:42,564
I've been worried about you, Helga.

454
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:48,400
Sure you're alright?

455
00:40:49,005 --> 00:40:49,760
Sure.

456
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:52,374
Sure I'm alright.

457
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:56,553
I'm so happy you've
come to take me away.

458
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,342
Let's get out of here quick.

459
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:01,953
I'll just get my things.

460
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:03,766
That won't take me long.

461
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:08,867
Just a minute.

462
00:41:27,847 --> 00:41:29,635
Hello baby. Come on, snap into it.

463
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,053
The supper will be ready
in my tent in five minutes.

464
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:40,197
Hmm.

465
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:44,826
Who's your boyfriend?

466
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,462
What do you mean?

467
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,901
And I thought you were
just a little hick.

468
00:41:58,802 --> 00:41:59,731
Get rid of him.

469
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:01,347
What did you say?

470
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:03,483
Don't try starting anything
around here, sap.

471
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:04,588
Please.

472
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:08,353
Give him the air.
Be in my tent in five minutes.

473
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,091
What did he mean?

474
00:42:22,117 --> 00:42:23,876
What right has he to
talk to you like that?

475
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:27,610
What right?

476
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,403
He ..

477
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,024
He.

478
00:42:39,236 --> 00:42:39,986
Oh.

479
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:48,651
No, Rodney. It wasn't my fault.

480
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,828
It wasn't my fault.
- Don't try to explain.

481
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:53,233
They came to take me back.
- You couldn't wait for me?

482
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:55,223
They were going to make
me marry Mondstrum.

483
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:57,122
And I'd have sworn you loved me.

484
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:58,539
Rodney.

485
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:01,754
I do love you.
- You've a swell way of showing it.

486
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:04,165
It would have killed me if I'd
had to go back to that man.

487
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:06,162
So you stayed and took this one?

488
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:08,625
He just called me a sap.
And he was right.

489
00:43:09,115 --> 00:43:11,206
A sap not to realize how cheap you are.

490
00:43:11,668 --> 00:43:13,433
Rodney, don't say that.

491
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:16,361
I couldn't wait to get back.
To marry you.

492
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:19,371
To marry .. that's funny.

493
00:43:20,084 --> 00:43:22,686
I should have paid you off.
Thrown a few dollars on the bureau.

494
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,645
The kind of language you understand.

495
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:27,569
You don't know what you're saying.
- I even bought the ring.

496
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,548
Engraved with your initials and mine.

497
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:31,281
And the word 'always'.

498
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:34,478
You said you wanted a wedding ring
more than anything in the world.

499
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:36,280
Well. There it is.

500
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,183
Let me explain.

501
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:43,842
What will become of me if you leave me?
- I'll tell you what will become of you.

502
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:47,297
You'll go from one man to another just
like every other woman in the gutter.

503
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:51,730
Gutter?
- Yes.

504
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:55,725
Alright.

505
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,984
But I'll make it a worthwhile gutter.

506
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:01,942
I'd always hated men until I met you.

507
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:03,377
Hated them.

508
00:44:04,134 --> 00:44:05,371
But from now on ..

509
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:07,972
It will be different.

510
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,581
So, you're on your way, sap?

511
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,231
Dinner is now ready in the dining car.

512
00:44:45,251 --> 00:44:47,388
Dinner is now ready in the dining car.

513
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,910
How about having a little
bite with me, lady?

514
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:36,025
Number 13. Maybe someone is hurt.
Let's get down there.

515
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:47,104
Spencer. I told you it would happen.

516
00:46:48,357 --> 00:46:50,892
What is it, chief?
- A cave-in at Number 13.

517
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:52,437
Anybody killed?

518
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,196
You should have thought of that when
you forgot to put in the bolster.

519
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:58,136
I asked you if anybody was killed.
- It's no fault of yours they weren't.

520
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,525
A man can drink or work.

521
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:02,049
But he can't do both.

522
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:04,884
From now on you'd better
concentrate on the drinking.

523
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:06,038
You're through.

524
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:43,156
Oh Mike.
- Excuse me, judge.

525
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:46,884
Yes, dear?

526
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:48,727
Mike, dear.

527
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,501
Who is Friedman bringing tonight?

528
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,525
I believe he did mention his name but ..

529
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:58,320
The judge and I were talking
politics at that moment.

530
00:47:58,634 --> 00:47:59,278
Uhoh.

531
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:02,471
The next time I'll have
Friedman phone me.

532
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:04,789
The table looks lovely, darling.

533
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:07,872
You go on with your blarney.

534
00:48:10,977 --> 00:48:13,151
Marie, set two extra places.

535
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:18,463
I'll be back in a moment.

536
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:49,436
Hello?

537
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:52,057
Hiya, baby.

538
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:53,441
Is he really coming?

539
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,051
He ought to be here any minute.

540
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:56,625
I'm waiting for him now.

541
00:48:58,207 --> 00:48:58,887
Swell.

542
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,165
New clothes and a little money
straightened him out okay.

543
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:07,282
And did he fall for that yarn about
Kelly slipping him a juicy contract.

544
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:08,825
That's wonderful.

545
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:11,041
And he hasn't the
faintest idea who I am?

546
00:49:12,262 --> 00:49:12,991
Alright.

547
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:15,898
Oh, someday I'll tell you.

548
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:18,857
No, no. It's just a whim of mine.

549
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:22,717
I just want to pay back an old debt.

550
00:49:27,976 --> 00:49:30,850
Would you mind explaining again
just what I'm doing here, Friedman.

551
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:32,825
You want the contract don't you?

552
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:34,920
Yes. But this mysterious lady ..

553
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:36,948
What has she to do with contracts?

554
00:49:37,212 --> 00:49:40,323
My boy, the key to a big contract
is Commissioner Michael Kelly.

555
00:49:40,861 --> 00:49:43,059
And the key to Michael
Kelly is Mrs Lenox.

556
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:46,985
Is there ..

557
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:48,800
Is there a mister Lenox?

558
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,152
Now, is there a mister Lenox?

559
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,407
Come on, Rodney. Here we are.

560
00:50:00,907 --> 00:50:02,052
Good evening, Jane.

561
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:03,936
Take care of Mr Spencer.

562
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:10,062
Hiya, baby.
- Freddy. So glad you came.

563
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:14,593
Only, this is a very quiet party.
You won't enjoy it.

564
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,570
Don't worry, we'll suffer together.
- Yes.

565
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,646
Oh .. oh Rod.

566
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:29,278
Mrs Lenox - Mr Spencer.

567
00:50:32,923 --> 00:50:34,362
What a pleasant surprise.

568
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:36,536
Mr Spencer.

569
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,269
You see.

570
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,845
One never knows what
Freddy is liable to bring in.

571
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:43,634
Well Benny.

572
00:50:44,165 --> 00:50:44,891
Mike.

573
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,642
How are you?
- Here's that man I told you about.

574
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:49,776
Mr Spencer, I want you to meet Mr Kelly.

575
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:51,919
I've heard a lot about you, Spencer.

576
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:54,162
Thank you, Mr Kelly.
- Have a little cocktail?

577
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:55,651
Do, Mr Spencer.

578
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:57,834
Sure. I think a cocktail
will do you good.

579
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:00,368
You know the proposition I spoke about?
- Yes, Freddie.

580
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:02,541
I think it's going to go through.
- Good boy.

581
00:51:03,152 --> 00:51:04,008
A Martini?

582
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:08,691
No?

583
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,402
Perhaps you'd rather have ..

584
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:13,878
Have a little port, huh?

585
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:16,735
No thank you.

586
00:51:19,486 --> 00:51:20,589
Some hors d'oeuvres?

587
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:25,647
Maybe some caviar?

588
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:28,999
You know .. caviar?

589
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:31,266
Looks like buckshot.

590
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:32,908
But it isn't.

591
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:34,496
It's fish eggs.

592
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:36,578
You know, fish.

593
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,841
Come and meet some charming people.

594
00:51:51,831 --> 00:51:53,185
Did you like that, George?

595
00:51:54,216 --> 00:51:58,764
I think the most amusing thing about men
is they mistake cruelty for character.

596
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:00,509
They can't forgive.

597
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:02,386
They have no ..

598
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:05,083
No ..
- Tolerance?

599
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:06,735
Thank you.

600
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:11,695
I once knew a girl who went
through hell for the man she loved.

601
00:52:12,425 --> 00:52:14,393
But he had no .. tolerance.

602
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,340
So he told her:

603
00:52:16,793 --> 00:52:18,135
'You are a bad woman'.

604
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:20,198
'Go to the gutter where you belong'.

605
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:25,041
As a matter of fact she did
rather well for herself.

606
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:27,617
I knew an instance very similar.

607
00:52:28,098 --> 00:52:30,403
Only being a man,
I learned both sides of the story.

608
00:52:31,344 --> 00:52:32,135
Really?

609
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:36,572
I would love to hear you defend the
male sex, Mr Spencer. Please go on.

610
00:52:37,398 --> 00:52:39,470
True. The man I knew was intolerant.

611
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:41,990
But only because he was
crazy about the woman.

612
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,943
How interesting, Mr Spencer.

613
00:52:44,273 --> 00:52:46,166
Then he found out how
much he'd hurt himself.

614
00:52:46,612 --> 00:52:50,262
Being a man, he was afraid it would hurt
his character if he went back, huh?

615
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,555
No. As soon as he cooled
off he did go back.

616
00:52:56,604 --> 00:52:57,919
He did go back?

617
00:52:58,693 --> 00:53:00,454
Sure. The sap went back.

618
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:04,076
As usually happens, he found the woman
who was burning him up had gone off.

619
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:06,002
Probably with someone else.

620
00:53:06,631 --> 00:53:09,150
Those people usually meet
again sooner or later.

621
00:53:10,081 --> 00:53:11,869
Surely he must have seen her?

622
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:15,501
Yes. He saw her alright.

623
00:53:16,143 --> 00:53:17,674
She was sitting on top of the world.

624
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,175
Goody, goody, goody. I hope
she didn't even speak to him.

625
00:53:20,476 --> 00:53:23,518
You see, she couldn't resist the
temptation to humiliate him again.

626
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:27,499
You know, women don't
forget very easily.

627
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,511
They resent being called .. gutter.

628
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:33,777
I think we'd better change the subject.

629
00:53:34,174 --> 00:53:36,047
Ah, but you mustn't
miss the rest of the story.

630
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:37,664
That will interest you.

631
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:40,696
This woman.

632
00:53:41,327 --> 00:53:43,284
Not content with
smashing one man's life.

633
00:53:44,215 --> 00:53:45,409
Went merrily on.

634
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:47,386
To the highest bidder.

635
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:50,068
Always a parasite.

636
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:53,873
The last I heard of
her she'd sunk so low ..

637
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:57,765
She'd accepted protection
from a shady politician.

638
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:03,647
Mike.

639
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:06,145
I've had enough of this.
She'll treat you as she treated me.

640
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:07,854
When the next man comes along.

641
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,002
Only it won't hurt you because
you're used to her kind of woman.

642
00:54:11,475 --> 00:54:12,519
I must talk to you.

643
00:54:12,946 --> 00:54:15,866
I've nothing to say to you. If you were
younger I'd slam you into the table.

644
00:54:16,182 --> 00:54:18,790
Spencer, what's the matter with you?
- That goes for you or anyone else.

645
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:19,868
Rodney.

646
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:22,908
Goodbye, Mrs Lenox.

647
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:28,069
Susan.

648
00:54:40,725 --> 00:54:41,442
Susan.

649
00:54:53,966 --> 00:54:54,638
Susan.

650
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,218
No use talking, Mike. I'm leaving.

651
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:05,598
So this is the fellow you told me about?

652
00:55:05,918 --> 00:55:06,934
The first.
- Yes.

653
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,415
Now wait a minute.

654
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:11,206
Let's figure this out.

655
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,552
You can't run after him.

656
00:55:14,976 --> 00:55:15,880
Why not?

657
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:19,334
If you leave here tonight.

658
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:21,791
There will be no coming back.

659
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:24,016
Do you realize that?

660
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:25,991
Yes.

661
00:55:28,187 --> 00:55:29,576
But this man doesn't want you.

662
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:32,204
Of course he wants me.

663
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,658
All that bitterness and contempt.

664
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,962
It's only because he
is desperately hurt.

665
00:55:38,638 --> 00:55:41,138
A man doesn't feel that
unless he loves you.

666
00:55:41,553 --> 00:55:43,017
Well, it's a strange way.

667
00:55:43,503 --> 00:55:45,201
I don't expect you to understand.

668
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:47,559
I didn't until tonight.

669
00:55:48,707 --> 00:55:50,788
I wanted to hurt him as he hurt me.

670
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:53,563
And then ..

671
00:55:55,257 --> 00:55:56,129
I don't know.

672
00:55:58,224 --> 00:55:59,334
Think of your pride.

673
00:56:01,177 --> 00:56:02,541
Didn't I tell you I love him?

674
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:05,557
I'll make him see me as I was.

675
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:08,493
Susan, don't you realize
what you're heading for?

676
00:56:08,957 --> 00:56:10,335
What difference does it make?

677
00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:12,524
As long as it's with him.

678
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,191
Saints alive, what's the
matter with this house.

679
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:24,872
People coming and
going and bells ringing.

680
00:56:25,912 --> 00:56:26,556
Well?

681
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:29,462
I'd like to see Mr Spencer.
- That crazy egg?

682
00:56:29,816 --> 00:56:30,774
Sure, he's gone.

683
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,280
When do you expect him back?
- He's never coming back.

684
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,879
He's gone for good.
Like a wild one, he was.

685
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:40,717
Threw twelve dollars down on the kitchen
table and rushed off with his grip.

686
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:43,507
Where did he go?

687
00:56:43,791 --> 00:56:47,173
Maybe the big hotel at Timbuktu.
How should I be knowing?

688
00:56:50,776 --> 00:56:52,106
Didn't he say anything?

689
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:54,196
Leave an address or something?

690
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,425
Didn't I tell you he was crazy?

691
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:58,129
Never a word did he say.

692
00:57:17,436 --> 00:57:18,137
Susan.

693
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,658
Did you see him?

694
00:57:22,186 --> 00:57:22,772
No.

695
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:24,602
He had gone.

696
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,212
Where?

697
00:57:27,762 --> 00:57:28,754
I don't know.

698
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:31,688
Susan.

699
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:33,201
Come along with me.

700
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:35,537
Tomorrow you may feel
different about this.

701
00:57:36,108 --> 00:57:36,874
No, Mike.

702
00:57:37,632 --> 00:57:38,876
I'll never feel different.

703
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:42,097
I've got to find him.

704
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:44,680
New York is a pretty big place.

705
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:46,220
I know.

706
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:49,051
But I'll find him.

707
00:57:56,117 --> 00:57:57,046
Where to, lady?

708
00:57:58,235 --> 00:57:59,743
What?
- Where do you want to go?

709
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,924
I don't know.

710
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,624
Just keep on driving
until I tell you to stop.

711
00:58:06,134 --> 00:58:06,900
Okay.

712
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:14,852
Goodnight, Pepe.

713
00:59:16,362 --> 00:59:18,093
Do you think you should
go in there alone?

714
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,732
I've been in there
every night this week.

715
00:59:21,042 --> 00:59:23,177
That's one of one of the
toughest places in these parts.

716
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,619
Come and have a drink with me.
- No thank you.

717
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:27,778
I'll be getting back to the yacht.
- Goodnight.

718
00:59:44,569 --> 00:59:45,333
A table?

719
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:41,227
The American. He's here again.

720
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:44,016
Be nice to him.

721
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:46,078
He buys so much wine.

722
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:48,218
Big tips.

723
01:00:48,556 --> 01:00:50,300
Oh baby. Come darling.

724
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,241
Come, darling.

725
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,272
Tired?

726
01:01:14,662 --> 01:01:15,420
A little.

727
01:01:16,903 --> 01:01:19,256
I've done the same dance
eight times tonight.

728
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,641
Why not come out on the yacht?

729
01:01:21,953 --> 01:01:25,088
It'll be cool on deck.
- I'm not interested in yachts.

730
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,341
You know, I'm beginning to believe you.

731
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:30,500
Is that so hard to believe?

732
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:32,734
Yes and no.

733
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:39,657
I can see a little halo
around that head alright.

734
01:01:41,484 --> 01:01:43,082
But it hardly fits in with this.

735
01:01:45,446 --> 01:01:47,146
There is no halo, my friend.

736
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,748
Then why not sail with me?

737
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:51,646
Arabia.

738
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:52,941
Egypt.

739
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,487
Ceylon.

740
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,324
Sunshine. Pretty clothes.

741
01:01:57,605 --> 01:01:58,822
Contentment.

742
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:04,857
When the cruise is over,
you won't find me ..

743
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:08,165
Well, how shall I say it?

744
01:02:09,299 --> 01:02:10,699
Financially ungrateful.

745
01:02:15,681 --> 01:02:17,240
What's the matter? Don't you like me?

746
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:21,372
Better than any man I've ever met.

747
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:23,963
With one exception.

748
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,082
You are very interesting.

749
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:29,413
Perhaps I'm in love with you.

750
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:36,877
Anyway, I find it hard
to leave this port.

751
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:40,744
All my life I wanted to
meet a man like you.

752
01:02:41,522 --> 01:02:42,633
Understanding.

753
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:45,955
Now that I have met you.

754
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:48,136
I haven't anything to offer you.

755
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:52,688
Everything I have belongs to him.

756
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:57,926
Any news?

757
01:02:58,788 --> 01:02:59,479
No.

758
01:03:01,371 --> 01:03:03,035
But it can only be a question of hours.

759
01:03:04,327 --> 01:03:06,334
They send him down for a
spell every three months.

760
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:09,565
He's a week overdue.

761
01:03:10,946 --> 01:03:13,066
Of course I shouldn't say this really ..

762
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:17,863
But has it occurred to you that
he might never come down?

763
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,678
A lot of them don't, you know.

764
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:24,094
That swamp is a hotbed of fever.

765
01:03:25,026 --> 01:03:26,356
Why did you have to say that?

766
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:29,813
I thought perhaps if you knew
definitely you would never ..

767
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,409
Don't, don't.
- Why not take me?

768
01:03:33,761 --> 01:03:35,872
There wouldn't be a single
wish of yours I wouldn't ..

769
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:37,828
But I've told you what
I've been through.

770
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:39,500
Even to get this near to him.

771
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:42,096
A woman could go up
there and be with him now.

772
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:45,471
You don't think I would leave when ..
- A lot of women jump at the chance.

773
01:03:47,112 --> 01:03:48,020
I know.

774
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:50,980
Each time I write.

775
01:03:52,957 --> 01:03:53,911
Or phone.

776
01:03:55,563 --> 01:03:56,374
Alone.

777
01:05:10,135 --> 01:05:12,653
One room for tonight, baby.
Make it snappy.

778
01:05:17,992 --> 01:05:20,843
Hey, Suzie. The boys are
here from up the river.

779
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:04,433
Rodney.

780
01:06:09,123 --> 01:06:10,076
How are you?

781
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,790
Well, I'll be ..

782
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:17,937
Leave him alone. You know the
rules of the house. I saw him first.

783
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,297
What are you doing here?

784
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:24,091
I'm working.

785
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,627
Oh yeah?

786
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,569
Next stop Algiers and
then Port Said, eh?

787
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:35,735
Oh no.
- That's the route they all take.

788
01:06:36,186 --> 01:06:37,918
You leave him alone. He belongs to me.

789
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:41,041
Let me speak to you alone.

790
01:06:42,892 --> 01:06:43,564
Alone?

791
01:06:45,157 --> 01:06:47,005
Sure, why not.
- Oh baby.

792
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,388
Beat it, beat it.

793
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:54,787
You're looking pretty
good, old playmate.

794
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,220
You don't understand why I came here.

795
01:07:00,928 --> 01:07:01,601
No?

796
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,749
Penthouses and politicians
don't last forever, do they.

797
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,486
Alright.

798
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:18,678
Sit down and have a drink.

799
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:25,504
Why don't you sit down?

800
01:07:27,323 --> 01:07:28,359
No thanks.

801
01:07:32,012 --> 01:07:33,399
What have you got to say to me?

802
01:07:37,171 --> 01:07:38,636
So many things.

803
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:43,076
But I'll say them.

804
01:07:44,992 --> 01:07:46,021
Some other time.

805
01:08:01,288 --> 01:08:03,615
Frightened little one,
or just being coy?

806
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:32,440
Now that we've said hello.

807
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:35,959
What kind of a toboggan
brought you down here?

808
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,164
I left Kelly after I saw you.

809
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:39,455
That night.

810
01:08:39,776 --> 01:08:41,623
You took your time about
catching up with me.

811
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:44,410
It cost money. And I had to work.

812
01:08:45,002 --> 01:08:46,383
Same old trade, huh?

813
01:08:46,785 --> 01:08:48,318
Since I last saw you.

814
01:08:48,808 --> 01:08:50,694
No man has had a minute from me.

815
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:53,391
Not even a second.

816
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:00,858
You lie.

817
01:09:02,117 --> 01:09:03,691
No man since then.

818
01:09:12,037 --> 01:09:12,681
Well.

819
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:14,818
What do you want?

820
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:27,589
Our love for each other has made
such a wreck of everything.

821
01:09:30,997 --> 01:09:32,551
Your fault as well as mine.

822
01:09:37,554 --> 01:09:39,831
I thought that we might try again.

823
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,305
You know.

824
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:51,120
You're the only woman I wanted to build
a fence around, and have all to myself.

825
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:53,994
You built the fence.

826
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:55,919
An army of men.

827
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,733
But I never wanted anyone but you.

828
01:10:00,115 --> 01:10:03,540
But there never was a time that I
wouldn't have been as true as heaven.

829
01:10:04,161 --> 01:10:05,708
If you'd only let me.

830
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:08,253
Rodney.

831
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:10,865
I'll do anything for you.

832
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:13,125
Go anywhere you like.

833
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:16,496
I'll share anything.

834
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:18,475
Or nothing.

835
01:10:19,835 --> 01:10:21,407
We should forgive each other.

836
01:10:21,982 --> 01:10:23,244
And try again.

837
01:10:24,552 --> 01:10:26,808
We've got to forgive each other.

838
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:28,772
Rodney.

839
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:44,268
Ah, why talk about forgiveness?

840
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:48,265
Why ask anything different from me?

841
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:55,784
Every other man you knew
took you at your own price.

842
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,155
Nothing.

843
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:04,044
This time.

844
01:11:04,684 --> 01:11:06,419
I'll take you as I find you.

845
01:11:06,821 --> 01:11:07,454
No.

846
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:09,419
No, no.

847
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:11,607
Sorry.

848
01:11:17,205 --> 01:11:18,506
I thought you might need me.

849
01:11:20,332 --> 01:11:20,918
Oh.

850
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:22,907
One of your clients, eh?

851
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:25,082
No. She don't need you.

852
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,665
She's got a date with me.

853
01:11:27,437 --> 01:11:29,521
Beat it.
- I don't take orders.

854
01:11:29,797 --> 01:11:31,153
No?
- None of that, please.

855
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:34,193
I happen to know all about this.

856
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:36,981
I think you're making a great mistake.

857
01:11:39,222 --> 01:11:40,351
I wish she'd marry me.

858
01:11:41,954 --> 01:11:43,304
She's fine.

859
01:11:45,532 --> 01:11:46,428
Marry?

860
01:11:47,494 --> 01:11:48,441
Hey, listen.

861
01:11:49,106 --> 01:11:51,558
All you need is the price
of a marriage license.

862
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,828
Just the price.

863
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:56,329
Not the wedding.

864
01:11:56,723 --> 01:11:57,801
Just the price.

865
01:11:59,078 --> 01:12:01,499
Did it ever strike you for a second
that you might be wrong?

866
01:12:02,245 --> 01:12:04,192
What right have you
to take a stand like this?

867
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:05,406
What right?

868
01:12:05,924 --> 01:12:07,654
Do you know why I
wallow up in the swamps?

869
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,423
Do you know why I never drew
a sober breath on the waterfront?

870
01:12:11,354 --> 01:12:13,730
It's heat .. booze .. insects.

871
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,519
Damp-rot and sweat.

872
01:12:16,548 --> 01:12:18,148
But it eats up the memory of you.

873
01:12:23,654 --> 01:12:25,364
Come back. You come with me, yes?

874
01:12:25,852 --> 01:12:27,288
Ah, get away.

875
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:29,754
Okay.

876
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:31,804
I'm all set.

877
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:33,896
Come in.

878
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:38,344
This is a surprise.

879
01:13:46,287 --> 01:13:47,453
Yes, I'm on my way.

880
01:13:48,772 --> 01:13:50,531
The barge is leaving for up river.

881
01:13:55,249 --> 01:13:56,599
Nice of you to come and ..

882
01:13:57,447 --> 01:13:58,600
Say goodbye.

883
01:14:02,382 --> 01:14:03,883
So you're going to get married, eh?

884
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:07,373
Don't you care?
- Sure I care.

885
01:14:09,755 --> 01:14:11,771
That's why it will be nice
to know that you're set.

886
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,297
And happy.

887
01:14:13,608 --> 01:14:15,543
Wouldn't you like to go .. home?

888
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,982
There's a schooner sailing tonight.

889
01:14:21,789 --> 01:14:23,364
Why don't we leave on her?

890
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:40,207
These hurts that we have
inflicted upon each other.

891
01:14:41,001 --> 01:14:42,298
It's become a bond.

892
01:14:42,931 --> 01:14:44,406
Nothing can break it.

893
01:14:46,507 --> 01:14:48,727
We're just like .. like two cripples.

894
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:50,357
Twisted.

895
01:14:52,099 --> 01:14:54,352
Only together can we ever become ..

896
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:55,866
Straight.

897
01:14:58,409 --> 01:15:00,216
You've a queer way of looking at things.

898
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:07,846
Come on, Rodney. Shake a leg will
you, boy. That's the second whistle.

899
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:09,291
Go ahead. I'm coming.

900
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:11,621
Let me do that.

901
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,179
No. Please.

902
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:14,802
Let me.

903
01:15:22,992 --> 01:15:25,071
So you're going to get
the ring at last, eh?

904
01:15:26,947 --> 01:15:28,462
He seems like a pretty nice fellow.

905
01:15:30,521 --> 01:15:32,227
I'm glad you're getting that ring.

906
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:37,695
You know what would
happen if you'd come with me?
