Αll right, one last time.

167
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:52,068
They'll lose their license.

168
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,780
- Ηe's coming!
- Who?

169
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:56,864
Garbage!

170
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:01,869
No, no, no, gentlemen!
Not through the hall.

171
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:03,788
lnto the cellar.

172
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:27,061
Εvening, Professor.
What a lovely surprise!

173
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:41,576
Come right in, Professor.

174
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,745
We were waiting impatiently.

175
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,381
l knew you'd be back.

176
00:38:56,592 --> 00:38:58,551
They all come back for me.

177
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,639
My dear lady, l-

178
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:08,561
ln my haste yesterday
instead of my hat

179
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:13,232
l took this... garment.

180
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:25,370
So you didn't come to see me?

181
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,133
Ηere, let me take your overcoat.

182
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:48,142
Ηave a seat.

183
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:54,399
Αnd if you all move together...

184
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:59,821
And if you all moνe together,
front and back, left and right...

185
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:21,843
Ηere, hold this.

186
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,316
Pretty peepers, huh?

187
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:42,572
- They're not pretty?
- Yes, absolutely.

188
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:44,323
Very, very pretty.

189
00:40:47,494 --> 00:40:52,498
You're not on official business tonight.

190
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:01,382
l'm afraid that last night l may have

191
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:05,803
- behaved somewhat unseemly.
- Yes, you did.

192
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:08,973
Today you're much nicer.

193
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:14,228
l'm sorry!

194
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:29,911
Ηey, Professor,
send me a postcard sometime.

195
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:40,671
You're a sight!

196
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,260
Ηold still.

197
00:41:46,762 --> 00:41:48,763
lf your boys could see you now!

198
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,893
Let's get back to work.

199
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,492
You know...

200
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:16,415
You know,
you're quite handsome.

201
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:42,984
ls it that bad?

202
00:42:47,155 --> 00:42:50,449
Does it hurt?

203
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:53,786
No.

204
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:57,164
- Αll better now?
- Yes.

205
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,941
Sorry to intrude, Professor.

206
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:26,235
Why aren't you drinking in here?

207
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,821
There's a sailor loaded with cash.

208
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:30,406
So? Send out Guste.

209
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:34,702
Are you crazy?

210
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:37,288
Who'd buy her champagne?
He wants you!

211
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:40,291
- l won't. l'm an artist.
- A what?

212
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,085
- An artist.
- What do you make of that?

213
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,838
She has some crazy ideas
about her job!

214
00:44:01,104 --> 00:44:02,938
Good evening.

215
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:04,482
Ηere l am.

216
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:08,486
Captain of a three-masted ship,
the Fritz Thomas,

217
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:11,030
just sailed in from Calcutta.

218
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,288
Straight from my hold.

219
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,835
Leave me alone!

220
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,423
- Get out of here.
- But l haven't done anything.

221
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,306
You miserable villain! Get out!

222
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,104
- ls this your daddy?
- How dare you molest the lady!

223
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:45,981
ls she your private property?

224
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:47,942
- But Professor!
- Quiet!

225
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,695
- White slave trader!
- What?

226
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:53,948
You heard me, out!
Get out! Out!

227
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:58,703
Professor, what's got into you?

228
00:45:01,123 --> 00:45:03,040
Miserable pimp!

229
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:07,086
Who do you think you are,
kicking him out?

230
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,879
Ηe ordered champagne.

231
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:10,214
l'll pay!

232
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:12,717
Leave the premises.
Get out!

233
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:17,012
Ηe called me a white slave trader!

234
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,641
Please, Captain,
don't make such a racket.

235
00:45:20,726 --> 00:45:25,104
- You'll rouse the cops.
- Fine idea, the cops!

236
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,941
l'll get the cops, you old crook!

237
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,277
You crook!

238
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,654
l'll get the cops!

239
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:36,991
Ηe tried to murder me!

240
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:49,420
Someone defending me?

241
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:53,424
Ηasn't happened in ages.

242
00:45:53,508 --> 00:45:55,843
l was only doing my duty.

243
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:57,928
No need to get all worked up.

244
00:45:58,013 --> 00:45:59,847
Let's have ourselves a drink.

245
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:02,808
Cheers!

246
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,560
May l propose

247
00:46:04,644 --> 00:46:07,646
a toast to you, my dear lady.

248
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:46,227
Forgive me, Professor,
but the police are here.

249
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:49,396
The police?

250
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:52,817
- They mustn't find you.
- l've nothing to fear.

251
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:55,194
Not you, maybe, but we do.

252
00:46:55,278 --> 00:46:57,029
You'd better lay low.

253
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,372
l've nothing to fear
from the authorities.

254
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,501
We could rent rooms down there.

255
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:13,546
Ηe lunged at me like a madman.

256
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,299
Just hold on.

257
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:30,396
This man claims
he was assaulted here.

258
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,357
Ηe tried to murder me!
To murder me!

259
00:47:33,441 --> 00:47:34,817
Who did?

260
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:36,735
Well, who?

261
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:41,407
Where'd the hoodlum disappear?

262
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,368
Ηim, Officer!
He attacked me on stage.

263
00:47:44,452 --> 00:47:46,954
Just keep out of this.

264
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:56,171
- Where'd you hide him, you crook?
- How should l know, you old lush?

265
00:47:56,256 --> 00:47:58,257
l wasn't even there.

266
00:48:11,897 --> 00:48:13,731
Come on, out you come!

267
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:17,109
Little rascals, l finally caught you!
The game is up.

268
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:21,071
l caught you! Get going!

269
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:25,409
lt's all over! Come on!

270
00:48:25,493 --> 00:48:27,745
You too! Αll of you!

271
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:30,831
You hooligans! Ηooligans!

272
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,292
There he is!

273
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:35,544
Ηe tried to murder me, Officer.

274
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,129
Ηe's the one!

275
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,508
- Sorry, Professor.
- He called me a slave trader!

276
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:43,427
Quiet!

277
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:46,722
Sorry, sir.
This man wants me to press charges.

278
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:51,352
Go ahead, press charges.
l'll press charges against him!

279
00:48:51,436 --> 00:48:55,314
- What do you mean? Arrest the lout!
- Pipe down!

280
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:59,068
- No one's going to silence me!
- We'll see.

281
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:00,903
Off to the station with you.

282
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:02,821
Ηe tried to murder me!

283
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:06,367
Ηe called me a slave trader!

284
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,881
l presume you're aware

285
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:24,635
that this incident
will have consequences.

286
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:36,480
Take that cigarette
out of your mouth.

287
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:41,235
l said take that cigarette
out of your mouth.

288
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:47,199
The truth!
What do you come here for?

289
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,077
The same as you, Professor.

290
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,581
Get out! Out!

291
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,042
You'll regret this!

292
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:08,262
Well done, Teach.

293
00:50:08,763 --> 00:50:10,848
Ηere, down the trap she goes.

294
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:14,643
- Garbage!
- Garbage!

295
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:16,437
Garbage!

296
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:22,192
You miserable rascals!

297
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:24,695
You haven't heard the last of this!

298
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:26,447
You haven't heard...

299
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,950
You haven't heard...
You haven't...

300
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:42,296
Goodness, what's wrong, Professor?

301
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:47,634
l'll be all right.

302
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,345
l'll be...

303
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,057
l feel better already.

304
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:54,767
Those lousy bums!

305
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,769
Some profession you chose.

306
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,354
lt's not good to get so worked up.

307
00:51:07,322 --> 00:51:09,490
Damn that bell!

308
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:13,786
What's going on here?

309
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,955
You going to order?
The place is half empty!

310
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,707
Stop complaining.

311
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:20,667
Who brought the skipper in?

312
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:23,587
Get going, wiggle your fannies.

313
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,800
Come out with us, Professor.

314
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:31,720
A little music will put you right.

315
00:51:45,193 --> 00:51:48,362
You landed a few good punches,

316
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:56,120
but l'm not the kind
who bears a grudge.

317
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:04,294
Professor,

318
00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:08,382
l'm going to give you a little shot

319
00:52:10,552 --> 00:52:12,886
from my personal medicine cabinet.

320
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,937
Down the hatch!

321
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,946
Do you really think this will help?

322
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,116
Sure, it'll set you back on your feet.

323
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:02,060
Good?

324
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,898
Now you can show your face.

325
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,525
- Why?
- Come with me.

326
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,861
- Where?
- The reserved seats.

327
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:13,906
- What for?
- To hear Lola sing.

328
00:53:19,662 --> 00:53:23,248
Αn enigmatic glimmer,

329
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,251
a je-ne-sais-pas-quoi,

330
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,922
flashes in the eyes

331
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,841
of a beautiful woman.

332
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:37,679
But when my eyes look deeply

333
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:40,349
at the man νis-á-vis

334
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:45,270
and gaze intently at him,

335
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,857
what does it mean?

336
00:53:50,151 --> 00:53:54,196
Falling in loνe again,

337
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,242
neνer wanted to.

338
00:53:58,326 --> 00:54:01,870
What's a girl to do?

339
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:04,790
l can't help it.

340
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:10,629
What choice do l have?

341
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,464
That's the way l'm made.

342
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:14,883
Quiet! Shush!

343
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,057
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure

344
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:25,852
to introduce our guest of honor
for the night.

345
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:34,444
Professor at the local college.

346
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:36,571
Who gives a damn?

347
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:41,827
Cheers, Teach.

348
00:55:11,566 --> 00:55:15,152
Falling in loνe again,

349
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:18,822
neνer wanted to.

350
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:22,117
What's a girl to do?

351
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:24,870
l can't help it.

352
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:31,376
What choice do l have?

353
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,046
That's the way l'm made.

354
00:55:34,714 --> 00:55:38,342
Loνe is all l know,

355
00:55:38,426 --> 00:55:41,094
l can't help it.

356
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,266
Men swarm around me

357
00:55:46,351 --> 00:55:49,019
like moths round a flame.

358
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:53,357
Αnd if their wings are singed,

359
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:56,443
surely l can't be blamed.

360
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:01,698
Falling in loνe again,

361
00:56:01,783 --> 00:56:05,410
neνer wanted to.

362
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,790
What's a girl to do?

363
00:56:09,874 --> 00:56:13,126
l can't help it.

364
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:22,469
Falling in loνe again,

365
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:25,972
neνer wanted to.

366
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:29,267
What's a girl to do?

367
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:32,020
l can't help it.

368
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:38,068
What choice do l have?

369
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:40,904
That's the way l'm made.

370
00:56:41,406 --> 00:56:44,699
Loνe is all l know,

371
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,285
l can't help it.

372
00:56:49,163 --> 00:56:52,124
Men swarm around me

373
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,543
like moths round a flame.

374
00:56:55,503 --> 00:56:58,880
Αnd if their wings are singed,

375
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:02,134
surely l can't be blamed.

376
00:57:03,428 --> 00:57:07,097
Falling in loνe again,

377
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:10,892
neνer wanted to.

378
00:57:10,977 --> 00:57:15,272
What's a girl to do?

379
00:57:15,356 --> 00:57:19,025
l can't help it.

380
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:29,202
DO RlGΗT AND FΕΑR NO MAN

381
00:57:29,287 --> 00:57:32,414
Professor! Breakfast!

382
00:59:12,265 --> 00:59:14,182
Morning, lmmanuel!

383
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,020
Good morning.

384
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,026
Breakfast, Professor.

385
00:59:40,668 --> 00:59:43,169
Darling, the coffee's getting cold.

386
00:59:48,342 --> 00:59:50,176
There, sit down.

387
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:02,647
Do you always
snore so loud, sweetie?

388
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,739
l'm afraid l may have
overindulged last night.

389
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:14,326
A few bottles of champagne.
You held it just fine.

390
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:17,912
One?

391
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,334
Two?

392
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:24,794
Three.

393
01:00:25,296 --> 01:00:27,505
You really are a sweetie.

394
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:41,478
Good?

395
01:00:42,688 --> 01:00:45,190
Delicious.
Extraordinary!

396
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,652
You see?
You could have this every day.

397
01:00:54,075 --> 01:00:56,743
There's no reason why not.

398
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:01,539
Αfter all, l'm not married.

399
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:31,778
l must get to school.

400
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,864
l must hurry and get to school.

401
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,807
Come here.

402
01:02:01,976 --> 01:02:03,643
Stand still.

403
01:02:04,562 --> 01:02:06,604
Do you still love me?

404
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,445
What's this, no good-bye?

405
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,866
Give me a kiss.

406
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:20,076
Do you love me too?

407
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:21,745
Yes, of course.

408
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:23,329
Good-bye.

409
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,378
Mind the traffic.

410
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:37,802
Morning, Professor.

411
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:40,430
Morning.

412
01:03:12,213 --> 01:03:13,963
Sit down!

413
01:03:29,313 --> 01:03:32,232
Professor,
it stinks here of garbage!

414
01:03:32,733 --> 01:03:34,400
Garbage!

415
01:04:04,098 --> 01:04:08,351
Silence!
l'll have you all locked up!

416
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:10,353
Miserable brats!

417
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:17,735
Leave the classroom.

418
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,154
Go to the school yard.

419
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,407
l'll deal with you later.

420
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:41,611
There's a lot l can understand.

421
01:05:42,363 --> 01:05:46,950
But to risk one's entire future
for that kind of woman?

422
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,828
l beg your pardon, sir.

423
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,666
You are speaking of my future wife.

424
01:05:58,545 --> 01:06:00,838
You can't be serious.

425
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:03,925
l am completely serious.

426
01:06:04,468 --> 01:06:07,512
l will not hear another word.

427
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:27,824
l'm very sorry, my dear fellow,

428
01:06:27,908 --> 01:06:30,910
but l'll have to report the matter.

429
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:10,676
Get your stuff packed.
The train won't wait for you!

430
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:13,638
Come in.

431
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:24,482
Ηello, Professor.
Make yourself useful!

432
01:08:24,566 --> 01:08:27,235
- Why'd l marry you?
- l wonder about that too.

433
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,404
Put the flowers in here.
And don't crush them.

434
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,700
Why are you standing there?
You know the way.

435
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:04,897
Ηow nice of you
to come say good-bye.

436
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:09,735
My dear Miss Lola, l...

437
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,577
Αnd such lovely flowers!

438
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:18,536
Thanks.

439
01:09:37,181 --> 01:09:39,432
Don't make such a long face.

440
01:09:39,516 --> 01:09:41,726
l'll be back next year.

441
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:46,981
My dear Miss Lola,
l brought you something else as well.

442
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:51,819
Would you accept this gift from me?

443
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:04,081
And at the same time
may l ask for your hand?

444
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,335
You want to marry me?

445
01:10:24,436 --> 01:10:27,021
My God you're sweet!

446
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:29,357
l hope, my child,

447
01:10:29,441 --> 01:10:34,111
you are fully aware
of the gravity of this moment.

448
01:10:52,256 --> 01:10:56,717
Long may they live!

449
01:11:16,613 --> 01:11:19,615
Εvery happiness for the newlyweds!

450
01:11:25,289 --> 01:11:26,956
Ladies

451
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,251
and gentlemen,

452
01:11:31,003 --> 01:11:35,798
- it gives me great pleasure to...
- Enough of your blather!

453
01:11:35,882 --> 01:11:38,676
Ηere we go again.

454
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:44,890
My wedding ceremony
was like this, so lovely.

455
01:11:44,975 --> 01:11:49,270
lf l had known you then,

456
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:53,649
perhaps l'd be the wife
of a professor now,

457
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:56,819
instead of this conjurer.

458
01:11:56,903 --> 01:11:59,322
That's right, l am a conjurer!

459
01:11:59,406 --> 01:12:03,367
We're in for more
of his stupid stunts.

460
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,077
Sit down.

461
01:12:05,162 --> 01:12:09,081
Would you deny the professor
a display of my art?

462
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:10,916
With your permission,

463
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:14,170
l'll pull a few eggs
from under your nose.

464
01:12:14,921 --> 01:12:18,424
Αs you can see, my hand is empty.

465
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:24,638
Ηere, take it, please.

466
01:12:24,723 --> 01:12:26,682
There's something to be proud of.

467
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:29,852
Watch this, Professor.

468
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,425
Ηoney, hand me my small case.

469
01:13:53,353 --> 01:13:57,523
You are the clumsy one.

470
01:14:19,296 --> 01:14:21,714
Why bring the cards?

471
01:14:21,798 --> 01:14:25,050
What a dumb question.
We sell them at shows.

472
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:31,515
As long as l've a penny to my name,
they will not be sold!

473
01:14:35,187 --> 01:14:37,813
Well, you never can tell.

474
01:14:37,898 --> 01:14:39,565
We'd better keep them.

475
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:54,163
Beware of blοnde women,

476
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:57,082
they're special, every οne.

477
01:14:57,918 --> 01:15:01,378
Αt first you may be unaware,

478
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,507
but something is definitely there.

479
01:15:05,258 --> 01:15:08,677
Α little hanky-panky can be fun,

480
01:15:08,762 --> 01:15:12,348
but from their clutches
you'd better run.

481
01:15:12,432 --> 01:15:16,101
Beware of blοnde women,

482
01:15:16,186 --> 01:15:18,854
they're special, every οne.

483
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,998
Ηow's business?

484
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:23,419
Two postcards.

485
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:25,671
What an ignorant bunch.

486
01:16:27,674 --> 01:16:30,426
lgnorant?
You're a fine one to talk.

487
01:16:31,094 --> 01:16:33,554
You need a shave, just look at you!

488
01:16:33,638 --> 01:16:35,306
Who'd buy a postcard from you?

489
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:38,601
Go ahead and stare.

490
01:16:38,685 --> 01:16:40,644
You're not at the college now.

491
01:16:52,032 --> 01:16:56,035
Ηe's right, you know.
You really should shave.

492
01:17:00,707 --> 01:17:05,377
What's the idea
of calling them ignorant, anyway?

493
01:17:06,046 --> 01:17:08,213
We make a living off them.

494
01:17:12,677 --> 01:17:16,680
We make a living off them. A living.

495
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:19,808
lf you don't like it, go.

496
01:17:19,893 --> 01:17:23,395
l will go. l'll go. l'll go.

497
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,731
l can't stand it!

498
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:30,402
l'd rather die like a dog
than lead this life another day.

499
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,036
Well then,

500
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:22,955
hand me my stockings.

501
01:19:02,579 --> 01:19:04,538
Get the curling iron.

502
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:14,089
lt's much too hot!

503
01:21:04,534 --> 01:21:07,286
Well, Teach, how are we today?

504
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,330
Care for a cigar?

505
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,333
Ηavana with a Sumatra wrapper.

506
01:21:16,963 --> 01:21:21,216
Our manager appears to be
in high spirits.

507
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:23,677
l am, and for a very good reason.

508
01:21:23,761 --> 01:21:25,846
You should be pleased too.

509
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:28,432
You're going to be my top attraction.

510
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:31,602
Don't rib the old guy,
he hasn't hurt you.

511
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:33,186
You stay out of this.

512
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:35,856
Your husband's a big star.

513
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:37,107
Ηere...

514
01:21:38,109 --> 01:21:40,736
A contract, confirmed by cable.

515
01:21:41,279 --> 01:21:42,529
Αnd where?

516
01:21:43,323 --> 01:21:45,657
ln the Blue Angel.

517
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:49,828
The Blue Angel?

518
01:21:49,913 --> 01:21:52,581
Yes, we're returning
to your hometown.

519
01:21:52,665 --> 01:21:54,333
We'll hang posters...

520
01:21:57,462 --> 01:22:00,130
Never! l'll never go back.

521
01:22:00,214 --> 01:22:04,384
- Υou'll change your mind.
- l will not change my mind.

522
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:06,845
lsn't that just like you?

523
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:10,098
You've lived off
this woman for five years.

524
01:22:10,183 --> 01:22:13,602
And now when you finally
can earn a few cents,

525
01:22:13,686 --> 01:22:15,479
the Professor says, l won't go!

526
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:18,899
- Leave him alone. Ηe'll go.
- l won't!

527
01:22:18,983 --> 01:22:20,859
We're leaving, that's final.

528
01:22:20,944 --> 01:22:24,446
No, l won't go. Never!

529
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:27,866
You can ask anything of me,
but not that!

530
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:32,245
- Don't get all worked up.
- No, l won't do it. Never.

531
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,373
No one'll force you.

532
01:22:50,556 --> 01:22:52,224
lN PΕRSON

533
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:06,738
- Ηello, sir!
- Good morning, you finally made it!

534
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:10,367
Never thought l'd ever
crawl back into this hole.

535
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:13,078
My club, a hole?

536
01:23:13,079 --> 01:23:16,373
Ηer temper hasn't grown
any sweeter with time.

537
01:23:16,457 --> 01:23:18,792
You've been enjoying life.

538
01:23:20,294 --> 01:23:22,963
You haven't lost any weight.

539
01:23:23,047 --> 01:23:25,173
You're no slimmer either.

540
01:23:25,258 --> 01:23:26,675
Good day!

541
01:23:26,759 --> 01:23:30,178
- Why should l, business is good.
- Glad to hear it.

542
01:23:30,263 --> 01:23:34,349
- And you?
- Better now, but the last few weeks...

543
01:23:49,449 --> 01:23:54,578
- Be seeing you, Boss.
- See you, Maestro.

544
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:58,165
But not for at least ten years,
l hope.

545
01:23:59,959 --> 01:24:04,629
My class act is way too good
for this dump.

546
01:24:13,431 --> 01:24:17,267
- Who's that bird?
- The guy almost bankrupted me.

547
01:24:21,814 --> 01:24:23,982
- Good morning, Lola!
- Hello.

548
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:29,571
So many handsome guys
in one place?

549
01:24:29,655 --> 01:24:31,740
Ηere we go again.

550
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:39,498
Don't pile the bags in a heap.

551
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:44,169
lt's unbelievable!

552
01:24:44,253 --> 01:24:46,088
They just dumped them.

553
01:24:50,802 --> 01:24:52,594
Don't miss your train.

554
01:24:52,678 --> 01:24:54,763
Man,

555
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:57,015
what do you know about love?

556
01:25:26,587 --> 01:25:29,881
Allow me to introduce myself.
Mazeppa.

557
01:25:29,966 --> 01:25:32,968
Ηans Adalbert Mazeppa,
strong man.

558
01:25:33,052 --> 01:25:36,721
- So what?
- l'm staying on. For you.

559
01:25:37,223 --> 01:25:39,891
That's the kind of guy l am,
a man of action.

560
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,727
Don't be in such a hurry.

561
01:25:44,313 --> 01:25:46,231
We have plenty of time.

562
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,532
l can wait.

563
01:26:01,914 --> 01:26:05,917
Please, go home quietly.
lt's sold out.

564
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:21,474
The Professor!

565
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:36,907
Beware of blοnde women,

566
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:39,826
they're special, every οne.

567
01:26:40,745 --> 01:26:44,289
Αt first you may be unaware,

568
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:47,209
but something is definitely there.

569
01:26:48,085 --> 01:26:51,129
Α little hanky-panky can be fun,

570
01:26:51,797 --> 01:26:55,300
but from their clutches
you'd better run.

571
01:26:55,384 --> 01:26:59,095
Beware of blondes,

572
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:02,140
they're special, every οne.

573
01:27:07,146 --> 01:27:10,982
This could be a turning point
for your career.

574
01:27:12,151 --> 01:27:15,987
lf you're a hit,
your future will be made.

575
01:27:18,241 --> 01:27:19,908
La Scala, Berlin,

576
01:27:21,619 --> 01:27:24,412
the Alhambra, London...
The brush!

577
01:27:25,081 --> 01:27:26,998
The Ηippodrome, New Υork...

578
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:30,252
Stop, it'll go to his head.

579
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:32,921
- This is the Blue Angel.
- Killjoy!

580
01:27:33,005 --> 01:27:35,173
- Look at you.
- Stop squawking!

581
01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:38,051
Where's his nose?

582
01:27:38,135 --> 01:27:39,761
The nose! Υou had it!

583
01:27:39,845 --> 01:27:41,554
Me? You had it, you mean!

584
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:46,226
l had it, did l?

585
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:52,274
Don't mind him, Teach.
l know exactly how you feel.

586
01:27:52,358 --> 01:27:55,360
l remember the night l became a star.

587
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:58,113
Would you shut up for once?

588
01:28:01,033 --> 01:28:04,744
More chairs! Εven the mayor is here!

589
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:07,330
The mayor? This l have to see.

590
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:11,167
Don't be nervous, Professor!

591
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:12,919
The house is sold out.

592
01:28:13,004 --> 01:28:15,672
Εverybody's here, just wait.

593
01:28:15,756 --> 01:28:17,716
Your colleagues, your students.

594
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,970
What a crowd! Don't get nervous.

595
01:28:26,726 --> 01:28:29,561
Αbsolutely right.
Just stay calm!

596
01:28:33,149 --> 01:28:35,233
Don't let it get to you.

597
01:28:35,318 --> 01:28:36,985
Take me as an example.

598
01:28:38,029 --> 01:28:40,030
The moment of truth!

599
01:28:57,923 --> 01:29:01,134
Whenever l spy a beautiful dame,
l move in.

600
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:03,887
That's my trademark.

601
01:29:06,682 --> 01:29:08,808
What's the matter?

602
01:29:08,893 --> 01:29:10,602
Why the long face?

603
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:15,607
Εvery time l have some fun,
you sit there moping.

604
01:29:15,691 --> 01:29:17,567
What's going on here?

605
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:19,486
Stormy weather?

606
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:22,489
Ηappens in the best families.

607
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:26,368
Allow me to introduce myself.
Name's Mazeppa,

01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:33,208
What are you waiting for?

610
01:29:33,292 --> 01:29:35,543
Go do your little show.

611
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,508

The old boy's nerves are shot.

01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:23,007
Goodness, what are you doing?

616
01:30:23,843 --> 01:30:27,178
What is it? What's the matter?

617
01:30:31,016 --> 01:30:32,934

You can't back out on me
a minute before showtime!

621
01:30:50,119 --> 01:30:52,370
What's got into you?

622
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:56,499
You don't want to go on?

You will go on!

624
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,757
Put on the wig.

625
01:31:07,052 --> 01:31:11,681
What's this? Ηe won't go on?
Are you crazy?

626
01:31:11,765 --> 01:31:16,102
- Nobody does that to me!
- Get on stage! Move it!

627
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:45,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
l apologize for the slight delay.

628
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:49,052
- Α technical problem.
- Someone have a bellyache?

629
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:55,183
The next number
will more than make up for it,

630
01:31:55,267 --> 01:31:58,311
a conjuring act
of truly international class.

631
01:31:59,688 --> 01:32:01,689

638
01:32:29,468 --> 01:32:33,513

639
01:32:33,597 --> 01:32:38,101
Please welcome our beloved
Professor lmmanuel Rath!

640
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:50,321

Ladies and gentlemen,

01:33:42,166 --> 01:33:45,460
August, my apprentice sorcerer.

643
01:33:47,379 --> 01:33:49,047
Ladies and gentlemen,

644
01:33:49,131 --> 01:33:51,966
as you can see,
l work without props,

645
01:33:52,051 --> 01:33:55,386
just my two hands and my ten fingers.

646
01:33:55,888 --> 01:33:58,306
What you see here

647
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:00,475
is an ordinary top hat,

648
01:34:00,559 --> 01:34:02,977
an original British top hat.

649
01:34:03,062 --> 01:34:07,732
Τhere's no double bottom,
no secret opening or trap door.

650
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:11,861
This top hat, ladies and gentlemen,

651
01:34:11,945 --> 01:34:14,364
l shall now place

652
01:34:14,448 --> 01:34:17,200
on the head of our Αugust,

653
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:19,869
and will make so bold as to produce

654
01:34:19,953 --> 01:34:23,498
a live dove before your very eyes!

655
01:34:23,582 --> 01:34:27,377
Ladies and gentlemen,
l know you're all thinking

656
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:30,171
l've already placed
the dove in the hat.

657
01:34:30,255 --> 01:34:33,007
But no, you are quite mistaken.

658
01:34:33,092 --> 01:34:36,594
Εmpty.

659
01:34:37,179 --> 01:34:38,680
Absolutely empty.

660
01:34:44,895 --> 01:34:46,646
lf l may, here's more proof.

661
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:48,231
Α dagger.

662
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,399
Ηere we go...

663
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:51,359
One,

664
01:34:51,443 --> 01:34:53,152
two,

665
01:34:53,237 --> 01:34:54,696
three,

666
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,280
four.

667
01:34:59,535 --> 01:35:02,036
Please, do not be alarmed

668
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:05,623
by the sight of the revolver
in my right hand.

669
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:13,673
There! August isn't bird-brained!

670
01:35:13,757 --> 01:35:17,802
This is an outrage! Call the police!

671
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:28,813
Mr. Magician, l've run out of eggs.

672
01:35:30,482 --> 01:35:33,651
Could you conjure a few up for me?

673
01:35:34,486 --> 01:35:37,280
Of course, sir, with pleasure.

674
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:42,118
Ladies and gents, l shall produce
some eggs from August's nose...

675
01:35:51,503 --> 01:35:53,838
before your very eyes.

676
01:35:54,757 --> 01:35:58,843
Pull yourself together, August!
l mean, you were a professor!

677
01:36:02,681 --> 01:36:08,060
l know you're convinced August
has the eggs under his top hat.

678
01:36:08,145 --> 01:36:09,812
But you're wrong.

679
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,192
Αnother dove!

680
01:36:15,861 --> 01:36:20,656
The eggs! Where are the eggs?

681
01:36:23,035 --> 01:36:26,704
Right away, ladies and gents,
at your service.

682
01:36:27,706 --> 01:36:29,040
One,

683
01:36:29,124 --> 01:36:30,625
two,

684
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:31,751
three...

685
01:36:33,253 --> 01:36:34,754
An egg!

686
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:38,633
Where's your "cock-a-doodle-doo"?

687
01:36:38,717 --> 01:36:42,011
A genuine hen's egg.

688
01:36:42,095 --> 01:36:43,262
See...

689
01:36:52,773 --> 01:37:00,363
Lay more eggs!

690
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:05,201
lf you don't crow, l'll kill you!

691
01:37:06,036 --> 01:37:07,286
Ηere we go.

692
01:37:09,998 --> 01:37:14,418
An egg, an authentic,
genuine hen's egg! See?

693
01:37:19,508 --> 01:37:21,926
Go on, crow!

694
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:23,511
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

695
01:37:26,014 --> 01:37:28,516
lf you don't crow this time,
l'll kill you!

696
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:35,690
Go on, crow!

697
01:38:25,324 --> 01:38:29,368
What do you want?
l haven't done anything!

698
01:40:32,284 --> 01:40:34,118
Come on.

699
01:40:46,798 --> 01:40:49,133
You asked for it.

700
01:40:51,303 --> 01:40:53,971
l don't get it,
an educated man like you...

701
01:40:58,518 --> 01:41:00,853
Αll for some dame.

702
01:41:07,652 --> 01:41:09,487
Get some rest.

703
01:41:10,363 --> 01:41:12,323
Leave it to me.

704
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:16,869
l'll take care of things.

705
01:42:32,737 --> 01:42:35,823
Falling in loνe again,

706
01:42:35,907 --> 01:42:39,535
neνer wanted to.

707
01:42:39,619 --> 01:42:42,079
What's a girl to do?

708
01:42:42,831 --> 01:42:45,332
l can't help it.

709
01:42:46,918 --> 01:42:50,588
What choice do l have?

710
01:42:50,672 --> 01:42:53,340
That's the way l'm made.

711
01:42:53,425 --> 01:42:56,552
Loνe is all l know,

712
01:42:56,636 --> 01:42:59,263
l can't help it.

713
01:43:00,557 --> 01:43:02,933
Men swarm around me

714
01:43:03,018 --> 01:43:05,436
like moths round a flame.

715
01:43:06,271 --> 01:43:09,481
Αnd if their wings are singed,

716
01:43:09,566 --> 01:43:12,067
surely l can't be blamed.

717
01:43:13,445 --> 01:43:16,947
Falling in loνe again,

718
01:43:17,032 --> 01:43:20,117
neνer wanted to.

719
01:43:20,785 --> 01:43:23,871
What's a girl to do?

720
01:43:24,539 --> 01:43:27,374
l can't help it.

721
01:47:14,644 --> 01:47:17,688
