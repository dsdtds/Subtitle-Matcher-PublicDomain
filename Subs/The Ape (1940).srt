1
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,726
Hello, Boys. Got any old
tires you don't want?

2
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,561
Only old tires I got I'm
riding on.

3
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:09,023
We got enough money to go to the circus
but not enough for the sideshow.

4
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:12,925
Save your money, plenty
of freaks around here.

5
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,617
Hey, you think they got all
the things they say they have?

6
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,744
Sure, the man told us.

7
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:25,080
Bet they ain't got no lions. They
have too, the man let us see them.

8
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,374
He did? Good thing it ain't
got no teeth.

9
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,252
Sure they have, long as anything.

10
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,962
Let's you and me go see them.

11
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,299
You can go ahead, we're going swimming.

12
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,551
Say, we're going past
Doc Adrian's house, ain't we?

13
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,577
Sure.

14
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,406
We're going right by
the front of the house?

15
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,532
Sure.

16
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,409
What's the matter, you're scared?

17
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,702
I ain't scared of no crazy doctor.

18
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,329
Well, if you're coming come on.

19
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,581
Well... Well, you see it's this way,
if I don't get home for dinner

20
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,750
why, mom won't let me go to circus.

21
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,794
All right, so you're afraid.

22
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,862
Well, you better stay here.

23
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,825
Get out of here, you little rotten.

24
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,038
Oh, no you don't!

25
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:48,957
Come on now.

26
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:52,150
Gee, look he's got Willy.

27
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,280
Hello.

28
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,650
I can't understand why they don't
do something about Doc Adrian.

29
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,862
He's destroying all the values in
this town giving Red Creek a bad name.

30
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,262
I think so, you're right, Mason.

31
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,407
He ought to been run out of
this town a long time ago.

32
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,326
Who ought to be run out of the town?
Doctor Adrian.

33
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,411
You should've been with us
this afternoon.

34
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,539
He scared the women so bad
they haven't got over it yet.

35
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,625
Yeah, this town's too healthy.

36
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,919
Maybe he scaring
himself a couple of patients.

37
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:20,339
Understand them big doctors make
a lot of money on nervous women.

38
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,716
Wasn't so funny when that
epidemic broke out, Quinn.

39
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,886
You know as well as I do he used a
lot of those patients as Guinea pigs.

40
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,223
I know nothing of the sort,
I know he did everything he could.

41
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:32,267
There's two or three in this
town who wouldn't agree to that.

42
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,729
However, I can understand his
reason for wanting patients now.

43
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,899
Well, he got himself
another this afternoon.

44
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,925
Little Willy over there.

45
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:49,308
He ran after me, hurt me
and I wasn't doing nothing.

46
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,953
Poor child.

47
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,288
I think you're all yellow.

48
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,708
She's right and none of you got the
courage to do anything about it.

49
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,753
His patients die on him and now he's
hanging around Miss Clifford's house

50
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,547
experimenting with Frances,
I guess.

51
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,298
You make a poor critic, Mason.

52
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,634
Your greed hasn't done this
town any good.

53
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:06,927
What you doing, preaching?

54
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,846
A little preaching wouldn't
do you no harm.

55
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,474
What with the people you squeeze dry
and the usury you charge on your loans.

56
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,560
Oh, I don't ask him to borrow.

57
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:17,145
I guess there's an answer for
that also.

58
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,338
But I think it'd be wasted on you.

59
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,066
Business is business,
Quinn and you know it.

60
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,694
Besides, we weren't talking
about me.

61
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,612
Why don't we kick the doctor
out and be done with it?

62
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,347
I'm ready any time
you're willing to start it.

63
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:37,398
Oh, yes, that prescription I'll fill it
in a second been quite busy this morning.

64
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,339
I'm sorry to delay you, Doctor.

65
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,425
Perfectly all right,
I can fix it myself.

66
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,093
It's... It's none of my business

67
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,679
and maybe we men of science
think different from other people

68
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:53,307
but if they ever find out in the
village what you've been doing...

69
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,892
You mean about the animals?

70
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,226
Yes, some of the dogs have
been missed.

71
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,146
Well, that phase of the
experiment is all over.

72
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,273
I found out all I need to know.

73
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,191
Can I help you?

74
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,736
Don't you think they need you
in the store?

75
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,388
Just as you say, Doctor,
just as you say.

76
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,924
Well, that's good enjoying
the last of the sun, ey?

77
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:30,552
Oh, Doctor, sit down.
Thank you.

78
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,931
Ah.

79
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,641
Well, how's my girl today?

80
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:36,934
Why, you're all dressed up.

81
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,810
Danny phoned, he's coming over.

82
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,520
So early?
He can't come tonight.

83
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,149
He's going to the circus.
Oh, yes the circus.

84
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,818
I almost forgot.

85
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,427
I've got a present for you, Frances.

86
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,113
Oh, for me, Doctor.

87
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,865
Well, now don't get too excited.

88
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,784
Just you wait until you open it.

89
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:54,826
It isn't anything at all now.

90
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,040
A jewelry case, oh, Doctor.

91
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:03,293
Oh, it's beautiful.

92
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,380
But why so much, Doctor, you gave
me a birthday present last month.

93
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,131
So I did.

94
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,758
Well, this is a make believe birthday

95
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:13,345
just as you're my make
believe daughter.

96
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:16,264
Was she very like me?

97
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,518
She would've been just 18 today.

98
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,521
She was to have worn that.

99
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:26,900
I couldn't save her and
I couldn't save her mother.

100
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,028
I hadn't the weapons to fight
the disease that killed them

101
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,196
but I have now.

102
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,448
Or at least,
I've got a knowledge of them.

103
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,867
Ten years it's taken.

104
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:41,289
Frances, you are going to
walk again.

105
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:46,169
You're so intense you
frighten me sometimes.

106
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,213
So Danny's going to the
circus, huh?

107
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,883
Yes, then he's coming back here
afterwards and telling me all about it.

108
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,468
Oh, he is, is he?

109
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,720
Well, why don't you go with him?

110
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,887
Oh, me?

111
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,806
Do you think she could?
Oh, you're fooling.

112
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,934
Why of course she could,
I don't know why she shouldn't.

113
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,936
Hello, everybody.

114
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,396
Oh, Danny!
Hello, Danny.

115
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,023
Hello, Mrs. Clifford.

116
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,402
Well, Danny, how would you like
to take Frances to the circus?

117
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,112
Gee, that'd be great only...

118
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,405
Why, of course she can go.

119
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,823
We can take care of her.

120
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,158
I'll be back for you later.

121
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,409
Oh, thanks, Doctor.

122
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,286
Now don't you worry, Mrs. Clifford.

123
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,247
Two strong men to look after
her, she'll be all right.

124
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,291
Be back later.
Goodbye, Doctor.

125
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,334
Danny, I think you better run
home and get yourself cleaned up.

126
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:31,590
You look as if you'd brought all of
the grease from the garage with you.

127
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,675
You know, Frances,
I think the Doc's crazy.

128
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,219
I suppose I'll have to like him
as long as he's nice to you.

129
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,889
He wants to be nice to everybody
but people won't let him.

130
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,099
Well, I'm not saying I
believe all the things...

131
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,769
Don't you believe any of the things
they say about him, Danny Foster.

132
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:46,480
Well, all right, don't get excited.

133
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:50,817
Look, Danny, the stories they
tell about the doctor

134
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:54,279
are just as dirty as the grease
on your hands and face.

135
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,990
Well, that about takes care
of me.

136
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,518
So long, Honey.
Goodbye, Danny.

137
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,353
Stay with it, Doc,
don't let it throw yah.

138
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,021
Careful.

139
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,940
There you are.
Okay, that was easy, wasn't it.

140
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,590
All right.
All right, Frances?

141
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,653
Oh, yes.
All right.

142
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:38,740
Right, okay.

143
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,326
Well, this time next year it
will take three men to lift you.

144
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,603
Oh, not three men, Doctor, if it did
they'd want to keep me in the circus.

145
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,540
Hop in, Doc.

146
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:48,708
Oh, no, you can get somebody else at
the circus to help you lift her down.

147
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,628
What's the matter, aren't you coming?
No, you two go on by yourselves.

148
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,964
Oh. Now, you don't mind if
I change my mind do you?

149
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:56,133
Oh, please, Doctor.
You'll have much more fun together,

150
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,969
off you go and don't forget to
tell me all about it in the morning.

151
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,178
So long, Doc.
We won't.

152
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,888
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Doctor.

153
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,515
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mother.

154
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,517
Bye, Darling, have a good time.

155
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,561
Bye.
Goodbye Doctor, goodbye, Mother.

156
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,020
Goodbye.

157
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,399
Oh, come, come, come now
this is no time for tears.

158
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,775
I know it, I can't help it.

159
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,945
Oh, nonsense, change
will do her a world of good.

160
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,138
Good night.
Good night.

161
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,637
Well, we made it.

162
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,889
Hey, did you see him, Mickey?

163
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,558
Who? The gorilla,
did you really see him?

164
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,977
Yeah, in the sideshow,
he's a big fella.

165
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,669
Is he bigger than three men?

166
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:55,066
That ape, that ape is bigger
than six men, six big men!

167
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,361
It's the biggest ape
gorilla in the whole world.

168
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,071
Look, here come the clowns!

169
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,889
Oh!

170
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,208
Having a good time?

171
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,793
Oh, yes.

172
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,670
You don't act like it.

173
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,048
Gee, everybody's looking at us.

174
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,050
I'm nervous.

175
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,343
Oh, what for?

176
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:25,663
Well, out with a married man
and you know.

177
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,605
Gee, this is the best circus
I ever saw.

178
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:38,008
It's the only circus I've
ever seen.

179
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:54,334
Get them while they're hot.

180
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,485
All right, Officer.

181
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,856
Here it's popcorn, right hot out
of the oven, excuse me, Sonny.

182
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,717
Peanuts, five cents a bag.

183
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,745
Isn't she lovely?

184
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,871
She's so graceful.

185
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,331
Oh, she's not so hot.

186
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,750
I saw her passing the garage
this morning.

187
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,319
Them costumes make a big difference.

188
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:46,511
That's what the doctor
calls muscular grace.

189
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,347
Muscular coordination.

190
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,416
Uh, honey, look over
at the ring there, see.

191
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,110
There you are.

192
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:07,806
You're all right now, you'll
be chasing bones in the morning.

193
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,493
What I've done for you I can
do for men.

194
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,853
If they'd let me.

195
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:27,826
Bye.
Bye.

196
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,016
That's all, Honey.

197
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,226
I'm sorry it's over.

198
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,378
We'll never miss another circus.

199
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,703
What are you trying to
do drive that animal crazy?

200
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,124
Well, he's getting mean it's
the only way I can handle him.

201
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,209
Did you ever try a little kindness?

202
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:46,256
Nothing wrong with him, Nabu, come
here, Nabu old boy, come on now.

203
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,634
That's it. Yeah, well two
years ago he killed my old man.

204
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,261
And I ain't gonna let
him forget it, understand?

205
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:55,515
I know he did, I was right here when he did it
'cause he was abusing him, same as you're doing.

206
00:15:55,539 --> 00:16:01,396
If you don't watch your step,
he'll get you too.

207
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,047
Why don't you mind your own business.

208
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,499
You boys wouldn't be gambling,
would yah?

209
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,752
Oh, no.
Sheriff, take me in.

210
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,046
That was a fine show you
fellas put on.

211
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,048
Yous was the funniest clown
I ever seen.

212
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,050
Oh, I rode a horse,
he was the clown.

213
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,177
He was?
Yeah.

214
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,786
Well, he looks like a judge.

215
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:52,221
Hey, Jim, Pete, let's give
them a hand, come on!

216
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,207
Can't handle it, sound an alarm!

217
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:05,108
Get the animals out!

218
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,159
Where's the nearest doctor?

219
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,246
Doctor Adrian, get something to
put him on, we'll take him there.

220
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,289
Get him on there!

221
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,833
Somebody better get after that ape
or he'll tear this town right open.

222
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,168
Pete, get a posse together.

223
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,779
Come on, Boys, let's see what
we can do about that fire.

224
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,164
Man badly hurt, sorry
to bother you, Doctor.

225
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:29,961
Bring him in here,
come on right in with him.

226
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:30,879
Oh, what happened?

227
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,338
An ape got him.
An ape?

228
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,424
Yeah.
Hope it scared him off in time.

229
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,843
This man's badly mauled.

230
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,886
Well, you better get
him into my laboratory.

231
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,121
Jane, you show them.

232
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,561
Well, now how'd it happen,
was he in the cage with the ape?

233
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,938
No, the circus burned
down and the ape escaped.

234
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,190
The circus burned down?

235
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,109
And the audience?

236
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,860
They'd all gone home.

237
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,779
Oh, thank heaven for that.

238
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,574
Now, will you want us any further,
Doctor? No, I'll take care of it.

239
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,018
Well, then come on, Boys, let's get
out and see if we can find that ape.

240
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,756
Don't let him get at me, Mister.

241
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,550
Don't let him get at me.

242
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,636
You're perfectly safe here.

243
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,347
I'm a doctor.

244
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:24,974
Am I hurt bad, Doc?

245
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,019
I'm afraid so.

246
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,021
I don't feel nothing.

247
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:32,357
Am I gonna die?

248
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,109
We all have to die sometime.

249
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,719
Oh, just don't let me die, Doc.

250
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,953
Man...

251
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:50,607
Are the highest kind of animal.

252
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,553
Hey, Doc?

253
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,640
What are you gonna do to me?

254
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,250
I'm going to write you
into medical history.

255
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:17,968
I'm going to keep a promise.

256
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,242
Wait here, keep your eyes open.

257
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,953
That sheriff ain't got no heart.

258
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,955
I'm so hungry I could eat hay.

259
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,649
Oh, there's a barn full, help yourself.

260
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,861
George, you take your fellas and search
the county up around Carter's farm.

261
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,947
Jim, you take your boys and
cover the west side of town.

262
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,867
Pete, you stay with me.

263
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,368
How about joining us, Mason?

264
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,037
Let the circus people do their own
work, why should we do it for them?

265
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,540
The circus has burned down,
they've had trouble enough.

266
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,000
Now that's their tough luck.

267
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,878
Well, if we don't find that ape
our own people might get hurt.

268
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,672
That's your job,
you're the law and order.

269
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,507
Why should I worry about
other people?

270
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,676
They don't worry about me.

271
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,387
You wouldn't be a little bit
scared would yah, Mason?

272
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,723
Well, don't be all day about it.

273
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,641
We're ready.

274
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:34,729
It gives a body the creeps to think
about that critter roaming around.

275
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,231
Better keep the doors
and windows all aboard.

276
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,174
No telling who he'll go for next.

277
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,266
Are you all right, Dear?
Mhm.

278
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,579
Want some more?

279
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,539
Whatcha thinking about?

280
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:57,960
I was thinking about that wonderful
woman aerialist I saw last night.

281
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,796
Oh, here comes Doctor Adrian.

282
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,672
Morning, Mrs. Clifford.
Good morning.

283
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,425
Frances.
Oh, good morning, Doctor Adrian.

284
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,429
I want to thank you again for the
wonderful time I had last night.

285
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,474
It was too bad about
that trainer, wasn't it.

286
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,351
Now don't you think about him.

287
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,978
This is the most
important day in your life.

288
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,648
Today, we are really
going to start her cure.

289
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,566
I found the serum that I needed.

290
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,445
I'm going to walk, Doctor Adrian?

291
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,448
I hope so.

292
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,701
I'm not just thinking about
you, Frances.

293
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,746
But of all the other suffers in the
world, all the little boys and girls

294
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,792
who can't go out into the
sunshine and play and have fun.

295
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:42,547
Who have to spend their lives
in a wheelchair like you.

296
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,507
I'll do anything I can,
Doctor Adrian.

297
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,133
I know you will, My Dear.

298
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,969
It's not going to be easy.

299
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,720
It's going to hurt.

300
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:53,140
But when it hurts don't be afraid, just
remember that when the pain is gone

301
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:58,104
it will leave... It'll
leave new life behind.

302
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:02,191
Huh?

303
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:07,178
I think we better get her ready.
All right, Doctor.

304
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:27,365
Now we've got him here and
there and here.

305
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:32,763
Now if we don't get any results tonight
we'll start in here and work west.

306
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,223
Change your mind, Mr. Mason?

307
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,474
I never change my mind.

308
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,184
You gotta have one first.

309
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,020
That's enough outta you.

310
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:42,106
Here's that Dispossess Notice on
Wilcox and I want it served tonight.

311
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,191
We're busy tonight it
will wait until tomorrow.

312
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,861
Your duty is to take care
of the citizens of this town

313
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,738
not fooling around chasing apes.

314
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:52,700
It seems you're in a mighty big hurry
to make people uncomfortable, Mason.

315
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,327
It's my business what I do.

316
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:57,538
Fine and it's mine what I do.

317
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:01,149
We'll get to this when
we have time, good night.

318
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,262
Oh, Doctor.

319
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,305
Well, Frances?

320
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:18,643
Oh, my legs, they feel like
lead I can't lift them.

321
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,269
But you never could lift them before.

322
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:23,189
Oh, I know but I never felt
them before.

323
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,484
You... You feel them, Frances?
You feel them?

324
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,653
They're so heavy.

325
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:32,782
Well, that's good news, My Dear,
that's what we were hoping for.

326
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:38,120
And it's only just the beginning.

327
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,374
If there's any change you
send for me immediately.

328
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:46,712
Yes, Doctor.

329
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,631
Oh, Mother.

330
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:55,513
Jane, Jane.

331
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:58,099
Jane!

332
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:04,939
Look, I succeeded, it's there,
life... Life in that tiny bottle!

333
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:08,609
It's working.

334
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:16,633
A child will walk again.

335
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,854
Just go.

336
00:25:55,555 --> 00:26:03,555
It's Wilcox he's all torn up!

337
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:04,957
Oh, we better get a doctor.

338
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,793
It ain't no good,
he's been dead for hours.

339
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:11,029
Let's notify the sheriff.
Gladly.

340
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:42,388
Doc?

341
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,098
Hey, Doc?

342
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,433
Yeah, what's wrong?
The ape got Wilcox.

343
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,728
Well, is there anything I can do?
No, no, he's dead as a doornail.

344
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,188
You better be careful, Doc.

345
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:54,340
Thanks, I will.

346
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:24,180
Miss Jane, you're safe.

347
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:28,559
But only you and I must
know that he's dead.

348
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,711
Good night.

349
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:47,036
My legs hurt quite a little, Danny.

350
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,247
I know now Doctor Adrian
is really going to cure me.

351
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,042
Well, if they hurt you
how can you be getting better?

352
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,544
Oh, you don't understand,
Danny, they never hurt before.

353
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,546
There was no feeling at all.

354
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,049
Now they feel alive.

355
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,468
Just the same, I don't like it.

356
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,762
I don't like things I can't understand.

357
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:08,432
Well, I don't understand either,
Danny, but I believe in him.

358
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,435
Oh, I have so much faith in
him, Danny.

359
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,062
He says I'm like a daughter
to him

360
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,315
and well, I know he wouldn't
hurt me unless he had to.

361
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:22,279
It's part of the cure,
it's just got to be.

362
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,989
All right.

363
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:28,494
I'll try to believe too, Honey, but
I'd rather carry you around all my life

364
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:31,271
than have anything happen to you.

365
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:05,763
Hello, Sheriff, any luck?

366
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,908
Not yet but we'll get him.

367
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,076
Well, I hope so.

368
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,746
Come on, Boy, come on.

369
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,856
There, it looks like
they've picked up a scent.

370
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:29,221
Well, what got into them, hold on
to them for a minute, will yah.

371
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,682
Hello, Doc.

372
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,851
Hey, haven't seen anything
of that ape have you?

373
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,311
Well, no, I haven't, Sheriff.

374
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:38,397
Well, my dogs just acted as
if they picked up his scent.

375
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,899
Oh, well, I better be careful then.

376
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:43,902
Yeah, you better be.

377
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,739
Having trouble with insects, Doc?

378
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:49,992
Yes, this is just a
little mixture of my own

379
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,994
I'm trying to get rid of them with.

380
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,811
Well, if it works let me know.

381
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,539
My yard's full of them.

382
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:56,707
Certainly will.

383
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,566
Thanks.

384
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:34,286
Henry, supper's ready.

385
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,996
Were you going out?
Yeah.

386
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,831
Oh, but I made lamb stew and dumplings.

387
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,417
I don't care for lamb stew
and dumplings, thank you.

388
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,944
Besides, the Sheriff wants us
out early to capture that ape.

389
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,799
You needn't lie,
I know where you're going.

390
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:49,385
Oh, you do?
Yes, everybody knows.

391
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:53,180
So, you been listening to gossip, eh?
I can't keep people from talking to me,

392
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:55,307
and telling me you found...
A new interest.

393
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,644
Suppose I have. Well, there's
nothing I can do about it, I guess.

394
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,479
Well, keep that in mind.

395
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:03,232
But, if you just wouldn't
carry on here where we live,

396
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,818
so people would stop pitying me.

397
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,321
Even if you go somewhere else. Why
don't you try going somewhere else?

398
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:11,156
But, I have no one but you.

399
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,075
I have no folks.

400
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,120
I've got no place to go.

401
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,729
You got the river.

402
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,231
Poor Mason,
I feel sorry for his widow.

403
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,900
Ah, she's better off.
Ah, that ain't funny

404
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,695
when a man's been clawed to death.
I didn't like him when he was alive,

405
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,572
and I don't see any reason
to like him when he's dead.

406
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:55,325
Just the same, it ain't right,
even if he was no good.

407
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:59,413
We gotta give that ape credit:
He only picks out the ornery cusses.

408
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,772
What makes you think you're safe?

409
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,295
Well, Boys, you get
yourselves some rest today?

410
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,464
About 40 winks,
we're plumb tuckered out.

411
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,008
Maybe we can get some more
people in to help us out.

412
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:14,470
Why don't we go out in the daylight?
Because he don't come out in the daytime.

413
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,847
The circus people told us
we'll never get him then.

414
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,849
We got to catch him prowling
after dark.

415
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:22,102
Think he's still hanging around the
village? He got Mason, didn't he?

416
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:25,314
And we found new tracks
up around Dr. Adrian's house.

417
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:28,049
Uh, get me a sarsaparilla.

418
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,374
Quiet, you! Now, what do you
think of that, Sheriff?

419
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,252
Even the dogs don't like him.
Well, what got into him anyway?

420
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:49,463
Acted the same way around his house.

421
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,381
Don't make sense.
Maybe it's 'cause

422
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,551
the Doc looks so much like an
ape hisself.

423
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,720
This is no time for joking.

424
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:59,205
All of you'll be on the job tonight.

425
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,871
I'm scared, Mrs. Clifford.

426
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,957
She looks almost...

427
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,917
I'm really scared.

428
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:30,337
We must trust Dr. Adrian.
But, we don't know.

429
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:33,799
He ain't got a patient in this town.
People don't just hate a fellow for nothing.

430
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,260
Do you hate him, Danny?
No.

431
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,720
It's not hating him, it's...

432
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,306
It's loving Frances the way I do.

433
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,726
If anything happens to her...

434
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,313
I'm going down to see.
I gotta ask him.

435
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,941
I gotta know.

436
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:54,236
Danny.

437
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,489
Danny's worried, isn't he, Mother?
Now, you just rest, Dear.

438
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:02,059
Danny'll be all right.
Oh, if my legs didn't hurt so.

439
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,329
But, I'm not afraid.

440
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,832
You aren't, are you, Mother?
No, Darling.

441
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,650
I want my little girl to walk again.

442
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:21,680
You ain't going in there, Doc.
Now, what is this, Danny?

443
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:24,975
I'm scared about her.
I gotta know what you're doing.

444
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:28,812
Well, surely you want her to live
a normal life like other people?

445
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,773
Well, sure,
long as nothing happens to her.

446
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:35,652
I love her just the way she is, Doc. I can
take care of her... I wanna take care of her.

447
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,904
I don't want no experimentin'
on her.

448
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:41,283
Danny, if through her
I could rid the world of...

449
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,411
I'm not in love with the world,
I'm in love with her.

450
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,788
I get it,
she's just a guinea pig to you.

451
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,626
Well, you gotta stop it,
you gotta stop hurtin' her.

452
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,110
Have you been to your garage today?

453
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,088
No, I ain't, I been too worried.

454
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:58,258
Well, you take care of your cars,
and I'll take care of my patients.

455
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,845
Now, just you run along.
I ain't runnin' no place.

456
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,891
I ain't no doctor, and I don't know
enough about what you're doing.

457
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:08,894
But, if anything happens to Frances...
Nothing's going to happen to Frances.

458
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,504
Now, don't interfere.

459
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,281
Here comes Danny with the Doctor.

460
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:23,408
How do you do, Dr. Adrian?
Mrs. Clifford.

461
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,452
Well, how is my patient
feeling this morning?

462
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:29,247
I'm all right.
She's been in great pain, Doctor.

463
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,291
In pain?

464
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,377
Well, that's good.
Good?

465
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,754
Of course it is,
that's what we are looking for.

466
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:38,548
Now, you prepare her.

467
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,033
It's working.

468
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,520
You say the name is Mason?
Yeah.

469
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:55,273
Yes, Doctor, initial H. Anything in
your examination to go into my report?

470
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,442
No, I believe not.
Well, I just said,

471
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,362
"The death was caused
by fractured vertebrae."

472
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,781
I guess that about covers it,
doesn't it?

473
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:04,950
Yes, I...
I should say that it would.

474
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:08,704
The reason I sent for you, Doctor, is
because you examined the circus trainer

475
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:12,916
when he was sent North, and this
case being a similar one to that,

476
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,003
I thought probably in your examination
that you had discovered something

477
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:20,197
that I had over looked
to put in my coroner's report.

478
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,259
I see.

479
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,804
This Dr. Adrian, whose name
is on the death certificate,

480
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,682
is he the local physician?

481
00:37:28,706 --> 00:37:30,726
Yes, if you can call him one.

482
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,894
Folks around here don't
like him much though.

483
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,856
And he was also called in
on the case of the trainer?

484
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,984
Yes, yes, that's the same fellow.

485
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:42,446
He came here during the
paralysis epidemic.

486
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,074
But, the folks around here
say that he experiments too much.

487
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:48,642
Thank you very much, Coroner.

488
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,001
I believe you've given me
all the information necessary.

489
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,235
That's fine, Doctor.

490
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,884
Oh.

491
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,094
Ohh.
Frances, what do you feel?

492
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,764
Oh, my legs.
They're hurting?

493
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,850
Oh, they hurt terribly. Feel more
sensation than you had yesterday?

494
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:15,228
Oh yes, much more.
But, you think perhaps you could walk?

495
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:18,190
Oh no.
Then, try to move your foot.

496
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,257
Oh, I can't!
You can, try!

497
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:25,489
No.
You can!

498
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,807
No!
You can!

499
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:38,668
Yes.
Oh my... Mother!

500
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,338
Ohh.

501
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,089
It's working.

502
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,676
Ohh.

503
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,995
Now, you rest, you rest,
and I'll be back later.

504
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,919
Mother.

505
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,983
I know I'll be able to walk again.

506
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,402
I know, Baby.

507
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,804
I know.

508
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,247
Dr. Adrian?

509
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:19,918
That's right. I'm Dr. McNulty
from the Robinson Foundation.

510
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:22,254
Oh, yes.

511
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,298
I had occasion to examine the
body of a circus trainer,

512
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:28,510
who was killed by an ape here
in this town. Yes, Sir.

513
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,804
I understand that you, uh,

514
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,140
administered to the wounded
man before he died.

515
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,269
I did my best for him,
but it was quite hopeless.

516
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:40,730
In spite of the spinal
injection you gave him?

517
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:43,066
I gave him no injection.

518
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,570
I just came from viewing
the body of this man Mason,

519
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,781
and I noticed a similar
spinal puncture.

520
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,325
Did you examine him also?

521
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,161
Well, they called me in, of course,
but it was too late, he was dead.

522
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,455
And you noticed no such puncture?

523
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:00,667
Well, the body was so
badly mangled that, uh...

524
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,587
Well, no, I didn't.
I see.

525
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,673
I understand they've had
an epidemic of paralysis here.

526
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:10,802
That's true. Many years ago,
the Robinson Foundation

527
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,805
found it necessary to
expel from the institution

528
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:16,373
a most promising young
research worker,

529
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:20,145
because of his daring, unorthodox
experiments with spinal fluid.

530
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:23,273
It was 25 years ago, to be exact.

531
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:26,359
Then, you are that
Dr. Bernard Adrian,

532
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:30,387
whose definite theories... And in spite
of what you did to me for 25 years,

533
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:33,241
I've been engaged in
proving those theories.

534
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:37,078
By what method have you been
doing this?

535
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,998
I'm not in a position
to disclose that at the moment.

536
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,125
I see.

537
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,794
Well, I'm afraid you leave me
no alternative but to report...

538
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,797
Wait.

539
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:52,594
If I could give you some small measure
of proof, will you change your mind?

540
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,746
I doubt it.
Let me show you.

541
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:08,509
I'll show you.

542
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,410
Now, you see?

543
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,288
Now, these two creatures
were completely paralyzed.

544
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,290
But, after my treatment, well,
you can see for yourself,

545
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,441
they're as lively and
healthy as ever they were.

546
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,962
All this has nothing to do
with the case. But, it has!

547
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,005
The serum I used...
What became of the serum

548
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,907
you took from those two men?

549
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,457
Well, you come with me.

550
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:52,320
Oh, Doctor.
Hello, Mrs. Clifford.

551
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,572
Now, this is Dr. McNulty.
How do you do, Doctor?

552
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,283
And he'd like to talk to Frances.
She's asleep.

553
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:00,453
No, I am not asleep, Mother.

554
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,771
Hello, Frances.
Hello.

555
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:08,420
But, now this child has
had a complete paralysis

556
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,172
of her lower limbs for 10 years.

557
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:15,343
Is that right, Mrs. Clifford?
Yes, it is, Doctor.

558
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,596
Have you had any feeling at
all in your limbs since, uh,

559
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,974
Dr. Adrian has been treating you?
Yes, they've been terribly heavy,

560
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:23,143
and I've had a great deal of pain.

561
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:27,564
Pain? Yes, and just a little
while ago I moved my foot.

562
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:30,650
Is that right?
That's right.

563
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,986
Will you do it again for me?

564
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,929
I can't.
Make an effort.

565
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:42,328
I can't.

566
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,772
Thank you, that's all.

567
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,235
I think you'd better take
her out into the sunshine.

568
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:02,289
Is anything wrong, Doctor? Why,
no, Frances Dear, of course not.

569
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,780
Well, her foot did not move.

570
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,366
But, I did feel a definite
muscular reflex.

571
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,726
Congratulations.

572
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:31,568
May I notify the foundation that...
That you'll come back to us?

573
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,826
It's too late.

574
00:43:40,244 --> 00:43:43,181
I have to stay here.
At least give me your promise

575
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:46,476
to keep us informed of your progress.

576
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,395
Every step of the way.

577
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,755
Thank you.

578
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:17,757
If it's not finished,

579
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,450
it's not finished.

580
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,798
Gee, look fellas,
do ya see somethin'?

581
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:40,446
Yeah. Yeah, so wait till you
see the white of his eyes.

582
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,640
Maybe they ain't white. I'm gonna
take a chance and shoot now.

583
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,788
Ahh!
Ah!

584
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:50,606
Come here, Willie!

585
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,861
I don't care how busy you are, Jeff
Halliday, I want my Willie found.

586
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:22,906
The idea of him wondering around
in the dark with that gorilla loose!

587
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,116
Which none of you men seem
able to capture.

588
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,660
Oh, it's all your nephew's fault: He's
always leading my little Willie astray!

589
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:29,913
Well, he's always under
Mickey's heels! Oh...

590
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:32,999
Now, Ladies,
we've got work to do.

591
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,501
Your kids are just some place
where they shouldn't be.

592
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,462
That ain't nothing new.

593
00:45:37,486 --> 00:45:39,589
Have you looked down in
Jones's barn?

594
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:41,674
I caught 'em smokin' there
last week.

595
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:45,178
We searched the whole town.
Go take a look for 'em, Pete.

596
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:47,055
They ain't far away.
Sheriff! Sheriff!

597
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,973
Sheriff!
Where have you been?

598
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,808
Just a minute Mom, we got him!
We got him!

599
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,310
Oh, oh, what... What is it?

600
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,646
Mickey killed him, he shot him dead!
Bang, bang! Between the eyes!

601
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,713
Hold it, kids.

602
00:45:56,755 --> 00:46:00,568
What'd you shoot him with, Mickey?
My.22, I got a good bead on him.

603
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,196
Where is your.22, Mickey?
He dropped it, Sheriff.

604
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,406
I did not! The ape grabbed it.

605
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,367
I'll ape you when I get you home.

606
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:09,494
Aw, gee, Ma,
don't you believe us?

607
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:11,537
Where did you see him?
On the pike,

608
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,957
about a quarter mile
from Doc Adrian's house.

609
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:16,251
All right, get 'em home.

610
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:18,169
Come on, Mickey.
Come on, Willie.

611
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:21,130
You're going home with me.

612
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:24,133
Come on, get out.
They probably shot a cow.

613
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,427
Yeah.
I'll look into it.

614
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:29,097
Where are the dogs? Red's got 'em
over on the other side of town.

615
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:31,540
All right, let's go.

616
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,237
Wait a minute, Boys.
I want a word with the Doctor.

617
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:46,805
I'll be right out.
Okay.

618
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,072
Is the Doctor in?

619
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,175
Yes?
Sheriff.

620
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:32,809
Well, good evening, Sheriff. Just
wanted to see if you were all right.

621
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,787
Haven't been out, have ya?
No.

622
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:38,416
I'm trying to think out,
Doctor, a lot of things.

623
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,752
That ape seems to take
a fancy to your place.

624
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:44,672
Now, don't take offense, Doctor,
I'm just trying to clear up my mind.

625
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:47,258
Them dogs of mine have been
sniffin' ape for days.

626
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,660
It's made 'em foolish, I guess,
else why'd they snarl at ya?

627
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:56,225
Well, there may be some chemical odors
on my clothes that offended them.

628
00:47:56,249 --> 00:48:00,545
Uh-huh, but I ain't never seen
my dogs offended at anything.

629
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,693
Can't understand it, Doctor.
Yeah.

630
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:08,988
Wait a minute.

631
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,889
Jane?

632
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:16,144
Just get me that torn coat
of the trainer's, will you?

633
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:23,294
Now, this is an idea that's just occurred to
me, I don't know whether it makes sense or not,

634
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:26,756
but perhaps it'll explain
your problem.

635
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:30,176
You see, this coat was worn by the
trainer when he was mauled by the ape,

636
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,845
and it's been in the house
ever since.

637
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,766
Now, that perhaps explains the
interest of the ape in this house,

638
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,875
and your dogs' in me.

639
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,312
No, no, no, I bet you're right.

640
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:44,690
Well, I'll get along. I think I'll
put a few men around your house

641
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:47,110
the rest of the night, Doctor,
just so you'll be protected.

642
00:48:47,134 --> 00:48:49,320
Don't bother, I am perfectly safe

643
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:52,323
and they might interfere with
some work that I have to do.

644
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:56,035
Well, maybe I'll just
keep an eye out myself.

645
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,246
I'm just a bit scared, Doc,

646
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,897
but don't tell anybody.
I won't.

647
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:15,721
What's that? This here's the
coat that trainer was wearing

648
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,516
when the ape killed him.
Boy, did he rip that up.

649
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,102
Tear it up with one swipe.
Well, come on now, Boys.

650
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,229
Well, this isn't getting us anywhere.

651
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:26,816
We lay down on this job, our own
coats will be in the same shape.

652
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,403
Come on, let's get busy. Now, you
fellows get back to your positions.

653
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:32,822
You boys go up this way.
All right, Sheriff.

654
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,848
I'll stay here.

655
00:49:56,161 --> 00:50:01,082
I can't fail.

656
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,326
Now, Frances Dear.

657
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:22,747
I want you to forget all the
hours you've spent in this chair.

658
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:25,041
Put them out of your mind.

659
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,960
You are not paralyzed,
you never were.

660
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,796
Fasten that firmly in your mind.

661
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,132
You're not paralyzed.

662
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:35,426
You'll do that for me?
I'll try.

663
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,803
Don't forget,

664
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,848
you are not paralyzed.

665
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:43,392
Now then,

666
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:46,312
move your right leg.

667
00:50:46,336 --> 00:50:48,397
Move it! You can!
No, I can't.

668
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,399
Try, try, you can.
Stop it! You're hurting her!

669
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,068
Quiet!
I can't, Dr. Adrian.

670
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:55,196
Try it, Frances, you can,
you know you can.

671
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,157
Move... There, you moved it,
didn't you? You moved it.

672
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,826
Now the left one, now the
left one, now move it.

673
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,454
Try, try again.

674
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:06,707
There! You moved them, you moved
them both, didn't you, Dear?

675
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,543
Yes.
All right then,

676
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:10,920
stand up and take a step
towards me.

677
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:13,881
Do it! Do it!

678
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:17,927
It's only your mind holding
you in that chair, not your body.

679
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:20,120
Do it, I say, do it!

680
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:23,766
You see, I told you!
Go get her some water.

681
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,019
Oh, she's all right, Danny.

682
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,254
She's better than she was,
isn't she?

683
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,882
She needs more.

684
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:38,364
She needs more.

685
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,057
You take care of her, Danny.

686
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:44,120
I'll be back.

687
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:47,373
Oh, Frances Darling.

688
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:49,357
Frances.

689
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:57,049
Name is Halliday, Sheriff
over the Red Creek.

690
00:51:57,073 --> 00:52:01,721
How did y'all find it here? Well, circus
jobs are pretty hard to get, Sheriff.

691
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:03,889
Oh, all jobs are kinda scarce.

692
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,600
Your boys get that ape yet?

693
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,810
That's what I come about.

694
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,438
Didn't get him, huh?
That's bad, he's a killer.

695
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:13,482
You boys got some responsibility
tracking him down, haven't ya?

696
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:17,695
Well, we did the best we could,
Sheriff, but fire broke up the circus.

697
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,574
Some of the boys stayed there, didn't they?
Yeah, but that's not what I come about.

698
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:24,952
I just figured when you're looking for
something, might help to know its habits.

699
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,788
Too many things about this
animal I don't understand.

700
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,832
Well, animals is all alike.

701
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:33,878
Lions, elephants, dogs,
they all got one track minds.

702
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:36,005
What do these gorillas live on?

703
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:39,115
He ain't killed any animals. Shucks,
no, they won't touch an animal,

704
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:41,218
'cept out of meanness.

705
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:43,220
They live on fruits,
vegetables and such.

706
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:45,723
That's what's bothering me:
What's feeding this fellow?

707
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:49,018
Maybe digging up a garden patch or
two, stealing a little bit of fruits.

708
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:52,605
No signs of it,
checked with all the farmers.

709
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,775
Do they prowl around much,
or do they stick to one place?

710
00:52:55,799 --> 00:53:00,196
Well, the gorilla generally sticks to one
place, if he's got anything that he's keepin'.

711
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,699
We see evidence that this
fellow's hanging around one place.

712
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:06,535
Hey, that ape had it in for
the trainer.

713
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,663
Where'd he die?
In the house of a doctor

714
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:12,667
near the outskirts of town, and that's the
place we think the ape's been hanging around.

715
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:15,836
Say, how would he trace
the trainer to that house?

716
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,922
Well, sense of smell.

717
00:53:17,946 --> 00:53:20,466
They're pretty good at that.

718
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:24,929
Did ya bury him in town? No, we sent
his body to his people up North.

719
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:27,807
That don't give us much, does it?

720
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:30,601
Any of his clothes around?

721
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:34,939
When that trainer was taken away, his
coat was left in the Doctor's house.

722
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:37,316
Would that draw the ape there?
It certainly would.

723
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,486
You'd better get rid of him.
I was afraid my time might be wasted

724
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,071
coming over here,
but I guess it ain't.

725
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:44,323
Thanks very much, Mr. Howley.

726
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:47,660
I better be gettin' on the road.
I'd like to make home around nightfall.

727
00:53:47,684 --> 00:53:50,145
Anything I can do for ya,
let me know.

728
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:11,082
Two injections...
Should've been enough.

729
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:30,602
Take this record book
and keep it for me safely.

730
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:45,074
One more.

731
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:58,379
Pete, you two boys go
over there by that shrub.

732
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,446
Danny, take your men down there
100 yards by that rail fence.

733
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,740
Okay. Aw, Sheriff, we've been
watching there every night,

734
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,993
and so far nothing's happened, now
I'm gonna... Will you take orders?

735
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:14,622
All right, all right.

736
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:17,041
You two boys go over by
Wilcox's barn.

737
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:20,127
You mean Wilcox's barn?
Yes, Wilcox's barn.

738
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:22,254
All right.

739
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,739
You two boys go down the road
100 yards.

740
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,512
You two wait for me over that
stone fence.

741
00:55:29,536 --> 00:55:32,121
All right, Sheriff.

742
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:57,873
Is the Doctor here?

743
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:01,502
You sure of that?

744
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:04,153
He's not in there?

745
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:30,281
Say, Sheriff, what's the idea sticking
around so close to the Doc's house?

746
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:34,702
Because that attendant told me that ape would
haunt any place where that trainer had been.

747
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:36,936
Ohh.

748
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:42,501
Hey, what's getting into that Sheriff?

749
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:46,362
He's... He's getting touchy.

750
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:49,967
Lost his sense of humor.

751
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:52,660
You know, when a man
can't laugh, it's just...

752
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:59,101
George, isn't this where we
found the body?

753
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,294
Mhm.

754
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,819
Um, do apes ever return
to the scene of a crime?

755
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,262
They're noted for it.

756
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:15,767
Well, we got something to
look forward to.

757
00:57:33,785 --> 00:57:35,328
Ah!

758
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:45,046
George! George!

759
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,236
Archie.
George!

760
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,615
What's a matter?
He got me.

761
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,224
Fire a shot.

762
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,227
Come on!

763
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:03,439
Did ya hear that shot? Yes, but
you told us not to leave here.

764
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,376
Where was it?
That way.

765
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,235
Over that way.

766
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:24,061
What is it?
What's a matter?

767
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,980
Did you fire that shot?
Yes.

768
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:29,465
It's Tomlin. The ape twisted
his neck, but Archie knifed him.

769
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:32,444
Can you walk? Pick him up and
carry him... Oh, I'm all right.

770
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,738
Go and get him.
God, he can't be far away.

771
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,907
Come on, get out, get
on from here, Fellows.

772
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:39,183
You boys come with me.

773
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,371
Doctor!

774
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:28,125
Look out, Doctor! The ape!
The ape!

775
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:31,712
Doctor, the ape! Doctor!

776
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:35,591
Do ya hear that?
Yeah.

777
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:38,802
Doctor! Dr. Adrian!

778
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,787
Doctor!

779
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:49,146
Oh, let me go! Don't stop me! No, no,
Frances, I'll see what's happened.

780
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:51,523
Frances!

781
00:59:51,547 --> 00:59:54,234
Let me give him one, Sheriff!
Hold on, that's enough.

782
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,177
He's done.

783
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,654
What are they doing? What are they
saying? Oh, Darling, I don't know.

784
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,575
It's the Doc.

785
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:24,038
All right, Boys,
take that off of him.

786
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:28,644
Let me through!
Did the ape hurt him?

787
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:33,256
Let me through!

788
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,636
Dr. Adrian.

789
01:00:49,856 --> 01:00:51,774
Frances.

790
01:00:56,654 --> 01:00:58,739
Come to me, Child.

791
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:03,369
Walk.

792
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:14,505
Walk.

793
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:27,768
There, you see?

794
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,883
He's dead, Boys.

795
01:01:40,907 --> 01:01:42,783
Ohh!

796
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:56,565
Hello, Danny.

797
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:58,716
No, wait, Danny.

798
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:15,792
Honey, you...
You mustn't over do it.

799
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:18,837
I'm doing better every day, Danny.
Oh, sure.

800
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:21,548
You're doing swell,
but you gotta take it easy.

801
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:23,592
I'll get your chair.
No, Danny.

802
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,886
Mother and I burned the chair yesterday.

803
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,888
I'm never going to use it again.

804
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:30,289
You bet you won't.
