Tequila.

20
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:06,626
Is he having a dance?

21
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,018
Five-ace card player.

22
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,947
Five dollars he doesn't
last another minute.

23
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:41,661
Cut him down.

24
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:43,913
You stay out of this, Yank.

25
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,973
We'll cut him down
when he quits kicking.

26
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:58,637
Billy.

27
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:02,265
Get in, boy!

28
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:29,558
Where have you been, Billy?

29
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,430
You'd better ride with us.

30
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:45,558
There ain't no Yellowleg
Yankee boy goin' with us!

31
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:46,685
I hear they got a new bank

32
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,827
and an old marshal
over at Gila City.

33
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,692
That beats cheatin'
at cards, don't it?

34
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:54,791
Let's go.

35
00:04:18,657 --> 00:04:20,218
The town looks quiet.

36
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:22,110
Yeah, I bet the
marshal's asleep.

37
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:25,390
Ever shoot a man in
his sleep, Yellowlegs?

38
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:26,657
You bein' a Yankee?

39
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,936
He ain't very sociable, is he?

40
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,647
Been with us a week and
ain't lost his temper once.

41
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:33,732
I never did trust a man

42
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:34,774
who didn't lose his
temper once in a while.

43
00:04:34,798 --> 00:04:36,067
Come on, let's go.

44
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,736
We ain't takin'
the bank today.

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,280
Uh, are you givin'
the orders now?

46
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:41,922
Looks that way, don't it?

47
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:47,954
Billy, get him in the back.

48
00:04:47,978 --> 00:04:49,205
No, Turkey, that
ain't my style.

49
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,973
Come on, he's
askin' for it, boy.

50
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,501
Any man that'd
turn his back on you

51
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,560
is just a dag blame fool.

52
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,173
I kinda like him.

53
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,940
I never know a Yankee before.

54
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:13,772
Hey, Mead!

55
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:32,957
Your horse needs a shoe.

56
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,793
There's a blacksmith's shop.

57
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,795
How long do you figure
that money's gonna keep?

58
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,588
Till I tell you when.

59
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,923
You know, I'm kinda
anxious to get my hands on it

60
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,800
and get over on old.

61
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,927
Take care of your horse first.

62
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:45,136
I was figurin' on
havin' a couple of drinks

63
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,210
with you fellas.

64
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:13,081
I sure hope,
sure hope this town

65
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,834
has some pretty girls in it.

66
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,085
When you get this
far out in the brush,

67
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:18,294
they're all pretty.

68
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:24,524
Billy, take the horses
round to the livery stables.

69
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:27,877
Uh.

70
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,573
Are you talkin' to me?

71
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,451
Your name's Billy, ain't it?

72
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:40,400
I'll take the horses
for you, mister.

73
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:43,111
Well, you look
like an honest man.

74
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:55,039
You know, some folks is
just born lucky, I guess.

75
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:57,265
Doggone it, you know,
don't push yours!

76
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,512
What's going on here?

77
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:10,889
These don't look
too pretty to me.

78
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:13,073
I told you, you ain't
been out here long enough.

79
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,119
Hey!

80
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,859
Hey, hey, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

81
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:23,943
Put that thing back up.

82
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,445
That'll have to wait, gents.

83
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:26,962
Wait, wait for what?

84
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,631
Church is about to start.

85
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,136
The parson don't like to
look at it during his sermon.

86
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,750
This ain't Sunday, is it?

87
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,919
That's a matter of
opinion in Gila City.

88
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,962
We haven't seen a
calendar in two years.

89
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:44,881
Some folks hold it's Monday,

90
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,716
but these folks
hold it's Sunday.

91
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,509
Are you gents
lookin' for a drink?

92
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:49,928
I'm lookin' right at it.

93
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,153
What's in that bottle?

94
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:53,932
Best we've got.

95
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,308
Even the Mayor drinks it.

96
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,616
That'll have to do.

97
00:07:58,502 --> 00:07:59,395
Tell me somethin'.

98
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:00,189
How about the bank?

99
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,439
How they hold?

100
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:03,107
The bank's open,
they're Monday folks.

101
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:05,458
The bar's closed when
the parson walks in.

102
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,369
Howdy, mister!

103
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,443
Hello, boy.

104
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:18,972
Hey, that's what
I call pretty.

105
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,209
Psst.

106
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:36,516
Who's she, the redhead?

107
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,726
Works over at the dance
hall across the street.

108
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,896
Imagine comin' in here
like she was respectable

109
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,982
and bringin' her
woods colt with her!

110
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,400
Imagine!

111
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,986
She wouldn't know his
father if she saw him again.

112
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,362
Poor boy.

113
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:51,990
I imagine it's as close
as she ever was to a parson.

114
00:08:52,014 --> 00:08:55,217
And her holding a prayer book
like she was respectable!

115
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,997
If they're going to heaven,
let's you and me not go!

116
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,222
Shh.

117
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:03,225

of the church meeting.

131
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,891
Whisky.

132
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,225
I told them the bar's.

146
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:44,326

00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:47,579
and folks, I welcome you.

148
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,069
And I'll be dishin' out
the gospels in a minute.

149
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:55,113
But first, I've got to
say a word to you gents

150
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,338
with your hats on.

151
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,369
This here is a
preach-house, gents,

152
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,679
and you'll take your
hats off to the Lord.

153
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:16,759
Mister, I never met a man

154
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,345
who wouldn't take off
his hat to the Lord.

155
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,445
Let's get it off.

156
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:25,283
You get on with
your preachin'.

157
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,777
He's gonna touchy
about that hat, ain't he?

158
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,112
I've never seen
nothin' like it.

159
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,629
He don't even take
it off to sleep.

160
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:41,800
We'll have a moment
of silent prayer.

161
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:57,748
Yes.

162
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:03,222
All that money just sittin'
out there across the street.

163
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,100
I've never known a
man so hungry for money.

164
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:08,186
You know, I think you're
studyin' up to be a miser.

165

167
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:12,648
Still dreamin' about that?

168
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,650
It ain't such a
dream, Billy boy.

169
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:16,861
We could set up our own
republic on this country.

170
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,045
It's wide open,
nobody can stop us.

171
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:23,492

Comancheros will sell us 100,

173
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:27,788

174
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:29,931
Yeah, fix us up an army.

175
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:32,877

00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:51,437
Mm-hm.

181
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,537
Raise this arm.

182
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:54,732
Raise it.

183
00:12:54,756 --> 00:12:55,806
Higher.

184
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:58,710
Mm-hm, all right.

185
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:03,199
It always pained you that way?

186
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:04,507
Almost always.

187
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,662
That ball ought to
come out of there.

188
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,471
That's
what I'm here for.

189
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:16,254
Have you ever
been in Springfield, Ohio?

190
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:17,479
No.

191
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:22,176
I'll swear I've seen
you someplace before.

192
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,250
Here.

193
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:25,862
How long will this lay me up?

194
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:30,268
Well, it's pretty
close to the collarbone.

195
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,061
A thing like that won't
heal overnight, you know.

196
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,135
What, a week?

197
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:36,498
More like a month.

198
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:41,279
Well, I got a little
business to attend to.

199
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,947
I don't think it
can wait that long.

200
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,506
Then stop wasting my time.

201
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:58,061
Wait a minute.

202
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,298
Missoura.

203
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:01,716
That's where it was.

204
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,635
A fella just about your
size, the Yellowleg sergeant.

205
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,138
Somebody had tried to scalp him.

206
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,016
A liquored-up Johnny
Reb with a Bowie knife.

207
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,767
He cut the sergeant
up pretty badly

208
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,868
before he was scared
off by something.

209
00:14:16,796 --> 00:14:18,733
You know, if you
take off your hat,

210
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,651
you could make me out a liar.

211
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,339
It's you, all right.

212
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:34,248
You certainly went out of
your way to look me up,

213
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:35,322
didn't you?

214
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,560
Take off the hat.

215
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:42,548
I've kind of got
used to keeping it on.

216
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:44,342
Why?

217
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,135
You haven't got anything to
hide but a few battle scars.

218
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,305
A lot of the boys came
out with worse than that.

219
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:51,098
What did you do
after the war ended?

220
00:14:51,122 --> 00:14:52,391
What would you do?

221
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,393
Well, I'd go after that Reb.

222
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,354
Well, I found him.

223
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:04,544
Is that Reb in town?

224
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:12,302
Well, what are you waiting for?

225
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,013
I'm waiting to get him alone.

226
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:18,850
You see, I want him
to know who I am.

227
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,546
I want him to know he's
gonna get what he gave me.

228
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,507
Are you sure you
found the right man?

229
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:25,607
Yeah, I'm sure.

230
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:29,220
I left my teeth marks
in his scalping hand.

231
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:32,390
And I'm askin'
you, my friends.

232
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:36,519
Any man, woman or
child that reckons

233
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:39,063
that he wants to go to hell,

234
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:43,625
I say let that man, woman or
child stand up and be counted!

235
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,284
What?

236
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,410
Start countin', Parson.

237
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:53,718
Get up, Turk.

238
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,416
Why, you white-livered coyote,

239
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,625
you mean to stand there,

240
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:01,669
and saying you intend
to go to that place?

241
00:16:01,693 --> 00:16:03,421
I sure do, Parson.

242
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,880
I'll tell you somethin' else.

243
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:07,049
Any man in this room that
don't get on his feet right now

244
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:09,067
and join me is
goin' there pronto!

245
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,484
Well, nice to meet
you, ma'am.

246
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,445
My name's Billy.

247
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:27,778
Billy Keplinger.

248
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:28,852
Get out!

249
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,596
Come on, Turkey!

250
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,899
Sure is a pretty girl.

251
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,365
Ma'am, I wanna thank
you for your fortitude.

252
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,229
We'll all close
with a prayer now

253
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:05,816
for those poor, misguided men.

254
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,486
All that money
just sittin' there,

255
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,488
waitin' on a
Yellowlegged Yankee.

256
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:13,214
I never saw a man so patient
about robbin' a bank!

257
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:15,675
Oh, church meeting's over.

258
00:17:18,228 --> 00:17:21,415
You have a nice afternoon.

259
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,516
Thank you again, ma'am.

260
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,960
Let me know when that
Yankee's patience runs out.

261
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:57,216
If his patience
ever does wear out.

262
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,005
That pretty redhead
that just went in,

263
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:12,174
I holds that today is Sunday.

264
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:15,052
What do you lovely
creatures feel about that?

265
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:16,444
I think it's Monday.

266
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:19,056
Get your horse.

267
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,130
Huh?

268
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:21,783
Get it.

269
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,925
Billy!

270
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:30,068
Hey, Billy!

271
00:18:30,092 --> 00:18:31,626
Yellowleg's ready.

272
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:00,889
Somethin' wrong with that
Yankee's shootin' arm.

273
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,858
Somebody get the doc.

274
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:43,739
He's dead.

275
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,689
It was
them outlaws, Kit.

276
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,415
They did some wild shootin'.

277
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,187
No.

278
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,400
It was me.

279
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,641
Is she the
dance hall woman?

280
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,017
That's her.

281
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,769
Imagine comin' in here
like she was respectable,

282
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,563
bringin' her woods
colt with her!

283
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:32,940
Imagine!

284
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,442
She wouldn't know his
father if she saw him again.

285
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:36,694
Poor boy.

286
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:37,695
I imagine
it's as close

287
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:39,613
as she ever was to a parson.

288
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:42,924
And her holding the prayer
book like she was respectable!

289
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:12,954
That Yellowleg sure has been
tryin' to get hisself drunk.

290
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:15,315
He ain't quite makin' it though.

291
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,775
Some men are like that.

292
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,318
Give me two.

293
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:20,294
The boy's leanin'
awful hard on him.

294
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,365
You reckon the Mayor will
be able to talk that redhead

295
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,799
into changin' her mind?

296
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,703
Ain't nothin' gonna
change her mind.

297
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:30,330
She got Doc Acton to
take care of the body

298
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:32,166
and rented herself a wagon.

299
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,349
She's goin' tonight.

300
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:35,851
Goin' alone if she has to.

301
00:21:57,924 --> 00:21:59,777
We've come to
change your mind, Kit.

302
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,154
We've decided to
have a nice funeral for the boy

303
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:03,781
right here in Gila City.

304
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,157
The whole town will come.

305
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:06,966
As Mayor, I'll see to it.

306
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:12,539
Mead will be buried in
Siringo, next to his father.

307
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:14,473
Now, Kit.

308
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,018
Bury him here?

309
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:19,880
You think I haven't
heard all the whispering?

310
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,174
You and your
gossiping little wives

311
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,802
with their pinched little faces
and their noses in the air!

312
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,303
Now, Miss Kit.

313
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:30,265
"That dance hall woman with
her freckle-faced woods colt.

314
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,575
No telling who the
father might be!"

315
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:37,815
They smell brimstone
every time I walk by.

316
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:40,734
They hated us both,
me and the boy.

317
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:42,820
Well, he's dead now

318
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:46,698
and you can tell your wives
that there was no sinning

319
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,424
and there'll be no funeral.

320
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:51,453
I'm taking him to Siringo.

321
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:53,539
You can't do that, Miss Kit.

322
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,332
It's smack in the
middle of Apache country

323
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:58,252
and there ain't nobody
willing to go with you.

324
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,130
Besides, there's not much
of it left but the weeds.

325
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:03,841
I've tried, Kit.

326
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,399
I've asked everybody.

327
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,112
I'm not asking
anybody to go with me.

328
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,268
Poor Kit.

329
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,144
She's trying mighty hard
to make folk believe

330
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:17,855
about the boy's pa.

331
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:19,273
Are you a single man?

332
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,191
Married.

333
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:21,859
I didn't know that, Cal.

334
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:24,403
Well, almost married.

335
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:26,196
Me and Emma.

336
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,865
She wouldn't let me go
with Kit, not that way.

337
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,424
Not to mention the Apaches.

338
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:40,101
I ain't never seen a
town so full of cowards.

339
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:44,105
I ain't never seen a
town so scared of Indians.

340
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,750
You can take three.

341
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:13,733
Kit?

342
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:19,917
I hate to think what all that
sun will do to your face.

343
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,058
Will you take this?

344
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:23,629
No, thanks, Cal.

345
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:24,922
Take it.

346
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:25,923
I've got no use for it.

347
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:27,148
I can't sell it.

348
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,942
Imported all the
way from St. Louis.

349
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,421
Get down from there!

350
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,952
I said get down!

351
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:56,995
Somebody's got to
drive this for you.

352
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,179
Not you.

353
00:24:59,355 --> 00:25:01,166
I'm askin' to.

354
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,017
I said get down!

355
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,439
Need any help, ma'am?

356
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:12,943
Get out of here, Billy.

357
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:15,196
I didn't mean to butt in.

358
00:25:17,123 --> 00:25:18,199
Your place.

359
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,328
Get down.

360
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,786
I bet she don't get 20
miles before she turns around.

361
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:05,929
$50.

362
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,029
And a call.

363
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,254
What have you got?

364
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:19,260
You lose to four aces.

365
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,461
We're leaving town.

366
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,546
You're a little
premature, Yellowleg.

367
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,646
Get your horses.

368
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:35,510
Billy and me like this
town, got a homie place in.

369
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:36,845
We're stickin' around.

370
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,055
You'd better leave alone
'cause we ain't leavin'.

371
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:46,730
It wasn't me that shot that boy.

372
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:47,898
Get up.

373
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:49,357
Get up!

374
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,611
Turk, it's looks like you
and me is gonna go to Siringo.

375
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:56,046
Billy, you and I
ain't leavin' here.

376
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,827
I'm just backin' him up.

377
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:02,913
Yeah, I kinda like the
idea of going to Siringo

378
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,596
with that redhead.

379
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,338
Come on, what's the matter?

380
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:39,689
Come on!

381
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:47,040
I guess you don't mind the
Yellowleg orderin' you around,

382
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,307
but I don't like it.

383
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:52,796
But if I could handle
that six-shooter like you,

384
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,870
Billy boy.

385
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,482
His back's
pointin' right at ya.

386
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:58,344
What's the matter?

387
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,011
Scared?

388
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:00,930
Scared he might hear
your gun comin' out

389
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,889
of the holster and hoard on you?

390
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:06,700
No, that ain't no
fit way to kill a man.

391
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,370
Not even a Yankee.

392
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:41,595
There she is.

393
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,199
Yah, yah!

394
00:29:18,364 --> 00:29:19,815
Good morning, ma'am.

395
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:23,470
You'll kill your horse
pushin' him like that.

396
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,722
Will you let me drive
that wagon for you?

397
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,641
I don't want your help!

398
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,726
Well, I'd be
mighty proud to ride

399
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,452
in that wagon with you, ma'am.

400
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,455
Leave me alone!

401
00:29:40,427 --> 00:29:41,477
Both of you.

402
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:48,245
Well, now, you know it
ain't exactly safe out here

403
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:49,537
for a woman?

404
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:52,097
Well, it ain't exactly
safe for you either.

405
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:54,501
Any of you.

406
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:56,211
Now git!

407
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,485
Why don't you leave this
woman be and let's head back?

408
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:05,595
Yah!

409
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:16,815
Listen, that bank is
probably just now opening up.

410
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,192
Yeah, it probably
is, probably is.

411
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:22,153
We'll follow along and
see she gets through.

412
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,382
Turkey, that's a woman!

413
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,027
Come on, let's go.

414
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:24,341
Your dress is kinda wet.

415
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:26,009
I guess you're gonna
have to dry it out.

416
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:27,985
It shouldn't take
long in this heat.

417
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:51,534
I never did see
a dance-hall girl

418
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,288
so touchy about gettin'
kissed.

419
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,374
You stay away from me.

420
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:58,625
What's you gonna
do with that rock?

421
00:31:58,649 --> 00:31:59,834
Use it on me?

422
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,602
Or a shotgun if I have to!

423
00:32:02,694 --> 00:32:05,856
Well, ma'am, I always
did go for high stakes.

424
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,635
Apaches.

425
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,637
They scalped him.

426
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:40,708
Yeah.

427
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,100
It looks like they did.

428
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:49,316
Come on, let's get
back to that wagon.

429
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:11,546
Hey, the coffee's ready!

430
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:22,709
It's plain to see that woman
don't want us round here,

431
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:25,143
so why don't we
accommodate her by leaving?

432
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:39,809
Did you desert?

433
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:44,481
Hmm?

434
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,483
Did you desert the Rebel Army?

435
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:48,776
I don't remember telling
you I was in the army.

436
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,711
I figured you for a deserter.

437
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:52,713
How did you guess?

438
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:56,910
Maybe I ought to take
her a cup of coffee

439
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,135
before it gets cold.

440
00:34:00,187 --> 00:34:02,999
Leave her alone.

441
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:05,851
Are you, are
you talkin' to me?

442
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:10,548
Hey, Billy, I think
Yellowleg's kinda taken a shine

443
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:11,732
to that woman.

444
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:13,885
All this time, we thought
he was feelin' sorry

445
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,011
about that boy.

446
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:15,888
Shut up!

447
00:34:15,912 --> 00:34:17,514
Touchy too.

448
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:18,613
Yeah.

449
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,019
Like he is about that
hat he keeps wearin'.

450
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:24,521
You know what I think
he's got under it?

451
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:25,595
What's that?

452
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,524
Money.

453
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:30,292
Well, there's one
way we could find out.

454
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,862
We can ask him.

455
00:34:32,886 --> 00:34:34,822
Take your hat off, Yellowlegs.

456
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:38,633
He's scared of you, Billy.

457
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,094
Yellowlegs.

458
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:45,432
Take your hat off or
I'll shoot it off.

459
00:34:49,945 --> 00:34:52,799
You try it and I'll kill you.

460
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:57,804
You know, Yellowlegs,

461
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:00,238
there's something about
you I just gotta like.

462
00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:23,913
Better mind your
thinkin', kid.

463
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:26,389
Yellowleg has done got
his claim staked out.

464
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:31,588
We could go back to that bank.

465
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:35,383
That posse would never follow
us out here, not to Siringo.

466
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:43,099
Or we could set up our
own little republic

467
00:35:43,123 --> 00:35:44,601
like that Edward fella
did down in Texas.

468
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,270
You know, the
republic of Freedonia?

469
00:35:47,294 --> 00:35:49,814
All this land out
here, just a-waitin'.

470
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,234
Think how you'd look in a
uniform with gold braid.

471
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:55,862
You're the kind of trigger-happy
young fella I can use.

472
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:58,839
You know, I'd make
you my military aide.

473
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:01,367
Then we'd start makin'
up a lot of laws,

474
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:03,661
but not one of them
would apply to us.

475
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:05,121
They don't now.

476
00:36:05,145 --> 00:36:06,414
- They never did.
- I'll tell you something.

477
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:07,957
There's money in
a thing like this.

478
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,751
If it's run right.

479
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,252
But we've got to start first

480
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,854
with that bank
back in Gila City.

481
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:16,090
Turkey, don't
you ever shut up?

482
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:18,301
You nag
like an old woman!

483
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:24,641
It's sure quiet
out here, isn't it?

484
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:26,643
Look, I don't blame you
for feelin' the way you do,

485
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,661
but right now, it
might be a good idea

486
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:33,874
if you could kinda make out
like we were getting along.

487
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,423
Are you always that stubborn
or just hard to figure out?

488
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:46,402
Lady.

489
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:48,889
I'm just tryin' to help.

490
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,311
Who are you trying to help?

491
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,466
Riding shotgun on this wagon

492
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,650
isn't gonna buy you
a clean conscience!

493
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:07,058
I'm beginning to wonder

494
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,576
if you ever figured on
going to Siringo at all.

495
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,606
What are you trying to say?

496
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,499
I mean, right here is as
good as Siringo for the boy.

497
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,129
You don't have to
prove anything to me.

498
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,992
Damn you!

499
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:29,455
Look at 'em fightin'!

500
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:30,707
Yeah.

501
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:38,229
You don't know me well
enough to hate me that much.

502
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:44,152
Hating is a subject I know
a little something about.

503
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,807
You've got to be careful
it don't bite you back.

504
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,308
I know somebody

505
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:51,284
who spent five years
looking for a man he hated.

506
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:56,206
Hating and wanting revenge
was all that kept him alive.

507
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,670
He spent all them years
tracking that other man down,

508
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:03,740
and when he caught up with him,

509
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,298
it was the worst
day in his life.

510
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,970
He'd get his revenge all right,

511
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:14,391
but then he'd lose the one
thing he had to live for.

512
00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:45,782
What was that for?

513
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:47,200
I was just checking my aim.

514
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,010
Nothing like letting the
Apaches know where we are!

515
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:59,019
That ain't no fit way to
kill a man, not even a Yankee.

516
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:03,800
You go on up ahead and
find us a place to camp.

517
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:05,802
There might be some
Apaches out there.

518
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:07,027
Then you go find out.

519
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:16,437
You know, you could
get the sun here.

520
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:18,163
I'll get used to it.

521
00:39:20,465 --> 00:39:21,360
We'll be leaving
you in Siringo.

522
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:23,043
You can find your own way back.

523
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,361
Come on.

524
00:41:52,993 --> 00:41:54,220
Turk, what are
you doin' out here?

525
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:56,237
This ain't your guard.

526
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:01,326
I wanna show you somethin'.

527
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:07,233
I've been carryin' this around
with me for a long while.

528
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,151
What's that?

529
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:09,500
It's a genuine general's cap.

530
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,531
I stole it over at San Antonio.

531
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:15,992
I never did show it
to anybody before.

532
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:25,042
A man sure really looks like
something wearin' one of these,

533
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:26,476
don't he, boy?

534
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:29,255
Huh?

535
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,715
Turk, if you're waitin'
for me to salute you,

536
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:32,273
you're gonna wait a long time.

537
00:42:36,036 --> 00:42:38,238
Here, I wanna show
you something else.

538
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:43,020
Here.

539
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,202
Come here.

540
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,789
See that part right there?

541
00:42:50,133 --> 00:42:51,402
It's not on a regular map.

542
00:42:51,426 --> 00:42:53,029
A kind of a valley.

543
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:55,031
Not many people know it's there.

544
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:56,991
We're gonna buy ourselves
some slave Indians.

545
00:42:57,015 --> 00:43:00,093
We're gonna put uniforms on
and we're gonna fill 'em good.

546
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,330
We'll be able to burn a fire
path through this country

547
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:05,265
from Tucson to Tucumcari.

548
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,044
What do you say, boy?

549
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:09,118
Huh?

550
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:12,131
What do you think of that, huh?

551
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:14,274
Oh, fine, Turk, fine.

552
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:20,379
Um.

553
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:24,435
Take over my guard
for me, will you?

554
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:58,985
I never, never traveled
with a lady before.

555
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:01,722
It kinda appeals to me.

556
00:44:01,746 --> 00:44:03,099
Get out of my way.

557
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:05,158
Maybe I will
and maybe I won't.

558
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,437
I'm telling you
to leave me alone.

559
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:12,024
Oh, I don't wanna, I don't
wanna trouble you, Kit.

560
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:14,751
I just wanna be sociable.

561
00:44:16,302 --> 00:44:21,341
And I never wear my guns
when I make a social call.

562
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:30,459
I always did like pretty things

563
00:44:30,483 --> 00:44:33,978
and you're just about the
prettiest I've ever seen.

564
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,950
Saddle up.

565
00:45:57,237 --> 00:45:58,563
Come on, get out of here.

566
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:02,218
I'm goin' with you, Billy.

567
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:03,219
You ain't goin' no place.

568
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,220
Huh?

569
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:06,028
You're stayin' right here.

570
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,143
He wouldn't stand a chance
in Apache country alone.

571
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:13,369
That's his lookout, ain't it?

572
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:17,926
Turk!

573
00:48:20,213 --> 00:48:21,263
He's gone.

574
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:47,174
They'll be going back to
Gila City, both of them.

575
00:48:47,198 --> 00:48:49,385
I'll drive you back in
the wagon if you want.

576
00:48:49,409 --> 00:48:50,610
No, thanks.

577
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,654
You still going to Siringo?

578
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:56,392
You think you can stop me?

579
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,867
Lady, I wouldn't even try.

580
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:30,584
I, uh.

581
00:50:31,594 --> 00:50:34,338
I'm sorry about
losing your horse.

582
00:50:36,891 --> 00:50:39,661
Well, you don't have to
talk to me, you know!

583
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:41,345
It ain't worth the effort.

584
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:47,044
Five years is a long
time to turn your back on,

585
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:48,921
especially for a woman like me.

586
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,423
That's what you
thinking, isn't it?

587
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:53,509
Lady, I quit thinking when
I turned my horse around.

588
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:54,718
Oh, stop calling me Lady!

589
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,053
My name is Kit.

590
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,154
I don't know you well
enough to call you Kit.

591
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:01,058
Don't think you're fooling me.

592
00:51:01,082 --> 00:51:03,993
You're not half as mad at
me as you are at yourself.

593
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:09,081
Gonna talk all
the way to Siringo?

594
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:11,527
Ha!

595
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:35,191
Grab that shotgun, come on!

596
00:52:32,882 --> 00:52:36,612
Must have ambushed that
stage down at the border.

597
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:11,313
I sure wish I
could take a bath.

598
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:14,039
Well, nothing's stopping you.

599
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:32,892
Come on.

600
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,855
Want some more?

601
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,173
You know,

602
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,744
I can hardly remember what
my husband looked like.

603
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:54,773
We were only
married a few weeks.

604
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:57,917
We were on our way to
Gila City when he was,

605
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,712
he was killed in Siringo.

606
00:54:09,437 --> 00:54:13,349
When Mead was born, they
wouldn't believe me.

607
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,354
Gila City put a
brand on both of us.

608
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:21,357
With their jokes and their talk

609
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,948
and their ugly little smiles.

610
00:54:38,257 --> 00:54:39,750
Getting dark.

611
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,298
We've got to have another horse.

612
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:49,828
Them Apaches can't be far off.

613
00:54:49,852 --> 00:54:52,080
They've got plenty of horses.

614
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:54,473
Now, you wait right
here until I get back.

615
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:22,512
Whoa.

616
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:31,130
Kit!

617
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:33,674
Pack up, we're moving out.

618
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:44,909
Whoa.

619
00:57:47,947 --> 00:57:49,356
That's far enough.

620
00:57:50,658 --> 00:57:52,943
I don't think I can
stay awake another minute.

621
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:56,071
You'll have to.

622
00:57:57,957 --> 00:57:59,032
Start digging.

623
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,342
What?

624
00:58:02,252 --> 00:58:03,772
We're gonna bury the wagon.

625
00:58:03,796 --> 00:58:06,441
From here on, our trail's
got to look Indian.

626
00:58:06,465 --> 00:58:08,443
If we're lucky, those
Apaches might still be out

627
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:10,169
trying to find their stagecoach.

628
00:58:46,005 --> 00:58:47,080
Getting tired?

629
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:50,626
I didn't ask for any help.

630
00:58:54,013 --> 00:58:55,156
I wasn't offering any.

631
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,674
I just asked if you
were getting tired.

632
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:26,245
Is Yellowleg a name?

633
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,582
Well, it'll do.

634
00:59:34,178 --> 00:59:36,031
Where are you from?

635
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:37,256
Ohio.

636
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:41,051
Is it pretty back there?

637
00:59:41,852 --> 00:59:43,136
Used to be.

638
01:00:13,217 --> 01:00:15,294
What are you doing?

639
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:26,388
Do and I'll kill you.

640
01:00:57,803 --> 01:00:58,920
What is it?

641
01:01:03,308 --> 01:01:04,358
Apache.

642
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:12,127
How could he miss?

643
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:14,379
He didn't.

644
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:16,005
Well, why didn't he kill us?

645
01:01:16,029 --> 01:01:18,982
Oh, he's got a little score
to settle up with me first.

646
01:01:23,162 --> 01:01:24,973
Start packing up.

647
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:42,217
Can't forgive me for making
you give up those five years,

648
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:43,218
can you?

649
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:45,220
I'll pick up his trail again.

650
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:47,154
Hardly seemed
worth the trouble.

651
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:52,717
There you go.

652
01:03:34,584 --> 01:03:35,770
He broke it.

653
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:14,851
What is he waiting for?

654
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:16,311
Why doesn't he kill us?

655
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:17,702
He will when he's ready.

656
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:25,320
Why don't you kill us

657
01:04:25,344 --> 01:04:26,487
- and get it over with?
- Stop it!

658
01:04:26,511 --> 01:04:27,572
Come on!

659
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:28,990
- Stop, leave me alone!
- Shut up!

660
01:04:29,014 --> 01:04:30,033
Shut up!

661
01:04:30,057 --> 01:04:31,617
Why do you let him torture us?

662
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:32,618
Shut up!

663
01:06:27,549 --> 01:06:29,444
Our Apache friend's
been awful quiet.

664
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:31,670
Maybe he got bit by a snake.

665
01:06:42,147 --> 01:06:43,932
Do you think
it's much further?

666
01:06:45,108 --> 01:06:47,086
What?

667
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,645
Siringo.

668
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:50,814
Siringo what?

669
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:52,691
Do you think?

670
01:07:23,146 --> 01:07:24,196
Strange.

671
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:29,728
I feel I know you better
than any man I've ever known.

672
01:07:31,905 --> 01:07:33,648
Yet I hardly know you at all.

673
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:43,310
What are you trying to do?

674
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:44,659
You're hurting me!

675
01:07:45,377 --> 01:07:47,120
What did you expect to find?

676
01:07:51,049 --> 01:07:53,334
I was only trying to
make you more comfortable.

677
01:07:55,178 --> 01:07:58,741
I'm sorry.

678
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:24,783
Sorry.

679
01:08:28,878 --> 01:08:34,083
There's some things about
me you don't understand.

680
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:40,632
You killed the only person
I loved in this whole world.

681
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,594
That's all I need
to know about you.

682
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:41,860
Next time I'll
be waiting for him.

683
01:10:00,053 --> 01:10:01,103
Inside.

684
01:10:02,597 --> 01:10:03,647
Go on.

685
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:33,051
This'll do.

686
01:10:43,555 --> 01:10:44,990
Here.

687
01:10:45,014 --> 01:10:47,216
You've got enough buckshot
in there to stop an army.

688
01:10:48,309 --> 01:10:50,845
He ought to be on top
of the bluff by sundown,

689
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:52,764
so I'll wait for him.

690
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:57,936
If I'm not back by morning,
you're on your own.

691
01:10:58,778 --> 01:10:59,938
Wait.

692
01:11:05,744 --> 01:11:08,947
I just wanted to say

693
01:11:17,213 --> 01:11:18,263
thank you.

694
01:14:57,642 --> 01:14:59,302
Where is it, by the mission?

695
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:04,640
What was your husband's name?

696
01:15:05,483 --> 01:15:06,961
Mead Tildon.

697
01:15:06,985 --> 01:15:08,895
My son was named after him.

698
01:16:20,808 --> 01:16:22,426
I
couldn't find it.

699
01:16:30,068 --> 01:16:31,118
It's there.

700
01:16:33,112 --> 01:16:36,023
No, there ain't nobody
named Tildon buried there.

701
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:49,078
You're just the same
as all the rest of them.

702
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:04,176
Here it is.

703
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:24,613
It must be one of the others.

704
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:55,413
Kit!

705
01:18:58,466 --> 01:18:59,526
Kit.

706
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:00,668
I found it!

707
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:09,536
I found it.

708
01:19:10,937 --> 01:19:13,165
Yellowleg.

709
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:18,378
Where's Turk?

710
01:19:18,402 --> 01:19:19,671
Right behind you.

711
01:19:19,695 --> 01:19:21,215
When Billy gets
hold of an idea,

712
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:23,217
he just won't let go of it.

713
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,443
Especially with the
red-headed woman.

714
01:19:39,257 --> 01:19:41,068
Well, there's no need
to keep the lady out here

715
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:42,236
in the sunshine.

716
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:45,254
Let's step inside
and talk things over.

717
01:20:13,165 --> 01:20:15,493
Sorry I can't offer
you folks a drink.

718
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:18,981
What did you do
with the money?

719
01:20:19,005 --> 01:20:20,232
This money?

720
01:20:20,256 --> 01:20:21,650
What money are
you talking about?

721
01:20:26,304 --> 01:20:28,323
There's only one thing
would bring him down here

722
01:20:28,347 --> 01:20:31,285
that's keeping ones up
here ahead of a posse.

723
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:34,178
I never saw folks
so scared of Injuns.

724
01:20:37,315 --> 01:20:39,266
I tell you, she
sure is pretty.

725
01:20:43,571 --> 01:20:45,356
Turkey, go get that money.

726
01:20:49,327 --> 01:20:50,804
Are you crazy?

727
01:20:50,828 --> 01:20:53,364
Now, go on, do what I told
you to do, go get the money.

728
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:10,782
You know, I, I just ain't
got the heart to kill him.

729
01:21:10,806 --> 01:21:12,075
Huh?

730
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:14,843
How would you like
to have your gun back?

731
01:21:16,228 --> 01:21:17,414
You want me to do it?

732
01:21:17,438 --> 01:21:18,847
I'll be much obliged.

733
01:21:29,158 --> 01:21:32,346
Just the minute he walks
back through this door.

734
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:33,420
What about her?

735
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:40,119
We'll decide that later.

736
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:42,454
You and me.

737
01:21:46,342 --> 01:21:49,237
Well, I'm going
for a little walk.

738
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:50,921
And I'll be around.

739
01:21:53,015 --> 01:21:55,702
The lady's got to
admit I got guts.

740
01:22:11,242 --> 01:22:12,969
You'd
better get out of here.

741
01:22:12,993 --> 01:22:14,194
You can't!

742
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:16,139
I've waited five years.

743
01:22:16,163 --> 01:22:18,073
The waiting is over,
now keep out of it.

744
01:22:19,041 --> 01:22:20,727
What happened to
Mead was an accident.

745
01:22:20,751 --> 01:22:22,077
I know that now,

746
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:26,400
even though I thought that I
could never forgive you for it.

747
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:30,628
But I could never love a man
who was a cold-blooded killer.

748
01:22:33,347 --> 01:22:34,397
Love?

749
01:22:36,809 --> 01:22:38,427
You don't even know me.

750
01:22:39,895 --> 01:22:41,221
I'm a face under a hat.

751
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:46,602
Did you ever wonder why
I won't take this off?

752
01:22:57,246 --> 01:22:59,433
Wanna talk about love?

753
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:02,451
I've seen you
with your hat off.

754
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,826
What about my scars?

755
01:23:50,132 --> 01:23:53,945
Do you know how many men
I've let kiss me and pinch me

756
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:56,714
just because their filthy
money gave them the right?

757
01:24:00,017 --> 01:24:03,079
Men with dirty shirts,

758
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:06,750
smelly arms, money
in their pockets.

759
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,146
Can those scars be forgotten?

760
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:16,859
Can I ask you to love

761
01:24:19,537 --> 01:24:21,238
a woman like that?

762
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:35,669
Now don't that make
a pretty picture?

763
01:24:37,012 --> 01:24:38,062
Where's Billy?

764
01:24:44,103 --> 01:24:44,872
Out of the way.

765
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:46,305
Don't do it!

766
01:25:44,622 --> 01:25:47,699
All this shooting and he
ain't even touched him yet.

767
01:25:49,376 --> 01:25:50,146
Turkey.

768
01:25:54,548 --> 01:25:56,192
Billy, are you crazy?

769
01:26:12,524 --> 01:26:13,918
All right, Yellowleg.

770
01:26:13,942 --> 01:26:14,992
This is it.

771
01:26:15,986 --> 01:26:17,464
You and me.

772
01:26:17,488 --> 01:26:18,730
Move out, Billy.

773
01:26:19,907 --> 01:26:21,843
Move out, Billy, I
ain't got time for you.

774
01:26:21,867 --> 01:26:24,220
There ain't but two
horses in this town.

775
01:26:24,244 --> 01:26:25,639
You know as good as me

776
01:26:25,663 --> 01:26:27,906
that only two people are
gonna ride out of here alive.

777
01:26:56,402 --> 01:26:57,796
You turned on me, Billy.

778
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,910
You turn coping on me and
I raised him from a puppy.

779
01:27:03,242 --> 01:27:04,902
I'm not giving him this money.

780
01:27:05,911 --> 01:27:07,514
No.

781
01:27:14,545 --> 01:27:17,331
Get me some slave Indians,
I'll train them myself.

782
01:27:19,383 --> 01:27:20,568
Take all this money.

783
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:27,117
Yellowleg, Yellowleg,
listen to me.

784
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:28,884
We can make ourselves a deal.

785
01:27:30,728 --> 01:27:32,288
I don't want that Billy
with me, I want you!

786
01:27:32,312 --> 01:27:34,973
Look at you, I put
you in that uniform.

787
01:27:37,776 --> 01:27:41,005
Now come on, listen to reason.

788
01:27:41,029 --> 01:27:43,049
Why can't a Yankee
join up with a Rebel?

789
01:27:46,994 --> 01:27:48,930
We could do it.

790
01:27:48,954 --> 01:27:50,265
Look at all this money here.

791
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:52,308
Look, I'll give it all to you.

792
01:27:59,757 --> 01:28:00,734
I'll make a general out of you.

793
01:28:00,758 --> 01:28:01,860
General Yellowleg.

794
01:28:01,884 --> 01:28:04,696
Think of how you'd look
in one of these caps.

795
01:28:33,248 --> 01:28:37,145
Listen, Yellowleg, like
I told you up there.

796
01:28:37,169 --> 01:28:38,772
You're gonna be in my army.

797
01:28:38,796 --> 01:28:41,274
I'll make a general out of
you with gold braid on you.

798
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:42,348
Remember that?

799
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:48,782
You know where you
left it, don't you?

800
01:28:48,806 --> 01:28:50,784
Chickamauga.

801
01:28:50,808 --> 01:28:51,868
Look at it.

802
01:28:51,892 --> 01:28:53,328
No,

803
01:28:53,352 --> 01:28:54,913
Oh, Yellowleg, listen to me,

804
01:28:54,937 --> 01:28:56,331
I don't want that
Billy around here.

805
01:28:56,355 --> 01:28:57,639
Look at me!

806
01:28:59,107 --> 01:29:00,543
Yellowleg, I'll make
a general out of you.

807
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:02,086
I'll give you one
of general's camp.

808
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:03,797
You'll look good
in that gold braid.

809
01:29:03,821 --> 01:29:05,105
Listen to me.

810
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:09,803
Don't!

811
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:17,242
Get out of here!

812
01:29:20,379 --> 01:29:21,981
Don't do it!

813
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:45,353
Billy!

814
01:29:51,243 --> 01:29:52,720
Billy!

815
01:29:52,744 --> 01:29:56,740
You tell Yellowleg it's
a fact I got soldiers!

816
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:43,062
Hi, Cap, we're trailing
a couple of bank robbers.

817
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:44,355
Looks like you got one of them.

818
01:30:44,379 --> 01:30:45,815
Where's the other?

819
01:30:45,839 --> 01:30:46,889
Inside.

820
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:50,904
Looks like they figured
you didn't have guts enough

821
01:30:50,928 --> 01:30:51,905
to come here.

822
01:30:51,929 --> 01:30:53,448
You know how people are.

823
01:30:53,472 --> 01:30:54,824
As long as it's their money,

824
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,910
the gates of hell
wouldn't stop them.

825
01:30:56,934 --> 01:30:58,135
Sure.

826
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:00,663
Parson, we're gonna need a few

827
01:31:00,687 --> 01:31:02,430
of the right kind
of words from you.

828
01:31:04,274 --> 01:31:06,669
We're burying a boy
alongside of his dad.

829
01:31:06,693 --> 01:31:08,562
I'll say the
right kind of words.

830
01:31:40,769 --> 01:31:41,871
This is a convoy.

831
01:31:41,895 --> 01:31:43,039
Yes, sir.

832
01:31:43,063 --> 01:31:44,707
Let go of me.

833
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:47,085
Gentlemen, you're gonna make
great officers in my army.

834
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:49,629
I'll soon have your
uniforms for you.

835
01:31:49,653 --> 01:31:53,758
In gold braid and then
we'll start training.

836
01:31:53,782 --> 01:31:55,192
Thank you, sir.

837
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:58,554
Well, Captain, if you'll
say, "Forward, yo!"

838
01:31:58,578 --> 01:32:00,974
I guess these ranks, we'll go.

839
01:32:00,998 --> 01:32:02,199

Follow me, men!

844
01:32:26,023 --> 01:32:29,335
We'll get us an army,
we know what to do.

845
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:31,770
