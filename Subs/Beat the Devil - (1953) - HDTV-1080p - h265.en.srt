1
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:38,334
Ragazzi, uno, due...

2
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,863
I must say, I do resent the way
these people stare at us.

3
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:26,073
They look as if they might
be going to spit.

4
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,657
Gwendolen! Dash it all.

5
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:32,576
Dear, it's unlucky to have someone
spit at you unless you spit first.

6
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,203
What a filthy superstition.

7
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:37,039
May yours be defiled.

8
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:38,713
What's that about?

9
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,547
These people may be thinking
of putting a curse on us.

10
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,502
You know, like,
"May your grandmothers be defiled."

11
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,008
That's why I say it first, just in case.

12
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,049
Where on earth
do you get all this stuff?

13
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,599
My old Spanish nurse told me.

14
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,640
Surely you don't believe it now.
You were only a child then.

15
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,437
She wasn't a child. She was old.

16
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,002
I always wondered why your parents
left you in charge

17
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:00,892
of such a dirty, ignorant old woman.

18
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:04,070
They cared for nothing except
to have me off their hands.

19
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,780
I've told you that.

20
00:04:05,866 --> 00:04:08,950
They'd have sold me on the slave market
if they hadn't been afraid of scandal.

21
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:11,115
Besides, my father was incompetent.

22
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:14,535
I don't suppose he knew
just how to contact the slave people...

23
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,911
Don't believe a word of it.

24
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,867
Common people
are quite fond of you really.

25
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,709
Stop it, Gwendolen. Don't do it.

26
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,795
You'll be sorry if we run into bad luck

27
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,797
just because
we didn't take proper precaution.

28
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,880
Suppose when we get to Africa
we find there's a native rising

29
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:31,574
and they're slaughtering all the whites.

30
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:32,976
Gwendolen!

31
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,872
If you don't let me spit I shall feel
like standing here in the streets

32
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,478
and just screaming with terror.

33
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:39,397
Stop it, Gwendolen. Look, those men.

34
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,586
- Well, they might be fellow passengers.
- Hey, wait for me.

35
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,088
Nonsense, best thing for you.

36
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,604
Fresh air is to the blood
what water is to the limbs.

37
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:48,862
Clean blood makes for a clear head,
clear head makes for straight thinking.

38
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:51,534
Must keep fit, Mr. O'Hara.
"Fighting fit, fit to fight."

39
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,640
Do you know who's motto that was?
Viscount Montgomery.

40
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:55,075
Commander in chief, British forces.

41
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,576
- Now, it's mine.
- Wait!

42
00:04:58,252 --> 00:05:00,960
Who... I mean,
what do you suppose they are?

43
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,378
Businessmen. Does it matter?

44
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:05,794
Well, if we're going to be on a small
boat with them for weeks and weeks...

45
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,625
I only said they might be
fellow passengers.

46
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:12,089
Harry, we must beware of those men.
They're desperate characters.

47
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:13,389
What makes you say that?

48
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,182
Not one of them looked at my legs.

49
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:22,815
Good morning, Mrs. Dannreuther.
Good morning, Billy boy.

50
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:25,393
Care to join us in a stroll?
Stir up the liver?

51
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,525
Sweat out the toxins?
Help nature to help you?

52
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,107
Wouldn't dream of it.

53
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,950
Really, Billy. You mustn't be
so offhand with Mr. Peterson.

54
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,184
If I were to treat him
with more than common politeness,

55
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,450
he'd misunderstand
and try to push me around.

56
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,455
Mr. Peterson is a bully.

57
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,630
- Billy, did you see this?
- Huh?

58
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:48,083
- See what?
- That man in London has been killed.

59
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:49,886
What man?

60
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,763
"Paul Vanmere, high-ranking official
in the Colonial Office

61
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,559
was stabbed to death early this morning
by an unknown assailant

62
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,432
outside a club in Soho.

63
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,228
This is the third crime of violence

64
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:03,932
to occur in that vicinity
within the past month."

65
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:10,573
What is it, Billy?

66
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,710
In heaven's name, Billy, say something.

67
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:38,266
You understand, of course,
that Peterson arranged this.

68
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,844
It seems there's been a lot
of violence around there lately.

69
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:42,224
Oh, don't pretend to be a fool.

70
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,057
But, look, Billy.
This happened early Tuesday morning.

71
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,312
We'd all left London well before that.

72
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:50,146
What about Jack Ross?
What about the galloping major?

73
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,777
But he only...
I thought he only stayed behind

74
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:56,075
to get that phone call from Mombasa,
if it came though.

75
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:57,697
He'll be here this morning.

76
00:06:57,788 --> 00:06:58,904
Well?

77
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,659
Don't get so excited.

78
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:03,082
Don't jump to unpleasant conclusions.

79
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:05,160
"Jump"? They might as well
have drawn a map.

80
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:08,998
Why was Peterson worried about Vanmere?
What made him think he was dangerous?

81
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:11,208
He was afraid
Vanmere wouldn't stay bought.

82
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:14,256
He was afraid he'd get
the wind up after we'd gone.

83
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:18,932
He had visions of him trotting upstairs
to his superiors and announcing,

84
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,224
"I have certain information

85
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,643
that certain persons have paid
certain sums of money..."

86
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,846
Don't talk so loud, Billy!

87
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,773
"... to obtain illegal rights
to certain mineral supplies."

88
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:31,274
That Indian, that raj or whatever he was
that you worked for in the old days,

89
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,104
he killed a lot of people, didn't he?

90
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:34,939
Ah, but he had a better style.

91
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:38,652
Besides, he was out for a kingdom
half the size of France.

92
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:41,284
What's the difference between that
and millions of dollars?

93
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:45,242
We must think of the future, Billy.
This is our big chance.

94
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:46,792
It may be our last.

95
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,623
Except for Mr. Peterson, we couldn't
even pay last night's hotel bill.

96
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,542
- Where are you going?
- I'm going down to a café,

97
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:55,435
drink a lot of Pernod,
and listen to the band.

98
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:58,259
You won't make a fuss, will you?
It doesn't do to make a fuss.

99
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,431
You have to think of the main objective.

100
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,429
Actually, it doesn't do to be fussy.

101
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:14,444
It's your move, Gwendolen.

102
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,199
Gracias.

103
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,426
The luggage is in there.

104
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:41,849
Bring it up.

105
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,817
- Harry, look. The desperadoes.
- Shh.

106
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:58,031
Not quite in our contract, Billy.
Hard liquor before noon.

107
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,108
- I'm celebrating.
- Celebrating what?

108
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,784
The safe arrival of the major.

109
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,113
He came galloping in a minute ago
looking tired but satisfied.

110
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,659
I take it his mission was accomplished?

111
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,380
Yes, but it's getting on
for lunchtime, gentlemen.

112
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,879
I'll see you later, Billy.

113
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:18,803
Your move, Gwendolen.

114
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,548
- Gwendolen, it's your move.
- Oh.

115
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,013
- Check.
- Blast!

116
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:28,932
Are you sailing on the Nyanga?

117
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:30,972
Africa-bound.

118
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,399
- So are we.
- Oh, my name is Chelm. This is my wife.

119
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,685
- How do you do? My name's Dannreuther.
- How do you do?

120
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,489
- Are your friends sailing too?
- The whole kit and caboodle.

121
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,575
You're a very mysterious
group I must say.

122
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,994
- Really, Gwendolen!
- How so, mysterious?

123
00:09:45,414 --> 00:09:49,283
Well, for one thing, you all appear
to be of different nationalities.

124
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,042
It's your move, Gwendolen.

125
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:53,838
Check.

126
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,797
I have a theory
about you and your friends.

127
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:58,716
Correction. My associates.

128
00:09:59,928 --> 00:10:01,260
As a matter of fact,

129
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:02,883
I think you're doctors.

130
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,718
Evil ones, I mean.

131
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:08,389
You're going to the heart of the jungle
where human life is cheap

132
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,219
to perform ghastly experiments

133
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:13,182
which require the sacrifice of thousands
on the altar of science.

134
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,860
You must excuse my wife.
She has a very lively imagination.

135
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,532
Checkmate.

136
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,531
I don't know how you expect me to play
a decent game when you keep talking.

137
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:28,658
Harry's been all out of sorts today.

138
00:10:28,749 --> 00:10:30,615
Usually he's a wonderful loser.

139
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,166
Good morning, Mr. Dannreuther.

140
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:35,836
I bring you the captain's compliments
along with the sad news

141
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:39,007
that the sailing of the SS Nyanga
has been postponed.

142
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,755
Now, look here. This boat is definitely,
most definitely,

143
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,882
scheduled to sail at 2400 hours.

144
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:47,807
Scheduled, Mr. Chelm,
but not, I fear, destined to do so.

145
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,138
Propeller gone or is the captain drunk?

146
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:53,562
Of course the captain is drunk, but
the real trouble is with the oil pump.

147
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:56,062
Well, it's not good enough.
Simply not good enough.

148
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:58,939
Quite right, sir,
but you are putting it too mildly.

149
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,941
The present oil pump is no good at all.

150
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,471
Well, how much delay does this mean?

151
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:05,491
Oh, to locate, bargain for, purchase,
and install a new one

152
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,318
will require, I should say,

153
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,745
more than a day, less than a fortnight.

154
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,207
Utter hopeless inefficiency.

155
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:15,417
Probably it isn't the oil pump at all.

156
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:19,164
Just making it an excuse to hang about
and pick up extra cargo.

157
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:22,796
Guns or opium? I wouldn't be surprised
if she turns out to be a smuggler.

158
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:24,878
What a miserable place to be stuck in.

159
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:27,385
Squalid, fifth-rate port.

160
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,300
Ever been in Puerto Verto before?

161
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:32,477
No, I don't know
this part of the world at all.

162
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:35,646
I thought not. Otherwise,
you wouldn't be so upset about staying.

163
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,598
Magnificent country!

164
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:40,857
Ruins to visit by moonlight,
fine stretch of beach.

165
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:44,906
Back there in the hills is one
of the few spots left in the world

166
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:46,984
where you can get decent food and drink.

167
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:48,534
It's called the Blue Pavilion.

168
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:52,364
I insist you give me the pleasure
of having dinner with us tonight.

169
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:54,949
- Oh, that's awfully kind of you, but...
- Us?

170
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:58,870
- You and your associates?
- My wife and me.

171
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:00,296
The committee?

172
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:03,671
Oh, uh, Mr. Chelm, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

173
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,501
This is the galloping major.

174
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,235
The committee wants
you to toddle 'round.

175
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:08,721
- Okay.
- Right away.

176
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,719
- I'll be along.
- Better toddle.

177
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:13,552
- I said I'd be along!
- They don't like to be kept waiting.

178
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,898
I'll lay on a car. We'll meet
in front of the hotel at 6:00.

179
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:20,191
Arrivederci.

180
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:25,696
Dannreuther. An American, I suppose.

181
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:27,698
Anyway, I...

182
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:28,784
I quite like him.

183
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:31,243
Time. Twenty-four hours in a day.

184
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:36,290
1,440 minutes for somebody else
to get busy on the same idea as ours.

185
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:39,790
We ought to have got a plane
and flown out, as I said from the start.

186
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,621
Do you remember I said it, O'Horror?

187
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:43,923
My name is not "O'Horror." It is O'Hara.

188
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,295
Do you hear? Mr. O'Hara.

189
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:46,745
Yes, Mr. O'Horror.

190
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,841
But do you remember I said it?
I said we ought to take a plane.

191
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,763
Time. Time. What is time?

192
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,307
Swiss manufacture it.

193
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,393
French hoard it.

194
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:55,805
Italians squander it.

195
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,889
Americans say it is money.
Hindus say it does not exist.

196
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:01,395
You know what I say?
I say time is a crook.

197
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:06,105
If we took a plane, we'd be there inside
of 15 hours, instead of who knows when.

198
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:08,676
I don't want any more talk about flying.
The sky is for the birds.

199
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,566
My feet are on the ground. Both of them.

200
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:13,829
Come in, Billy boy.

201
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,998
What's all the fuss about?

202
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:21,294
No fuss, Billy. We're merely
wondering what course to pursue

203
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,166
in view of this unfortunate delay.

204
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:26,875
Join the peasants in their revels,
go to church, write your memoirs.

205
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:30,549
Very funny.

206
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,097
I like an associate of mine
to have a sense of humor.

207
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:35,300
Good laugh does more
for the stomach muscles

208
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,386
than five minutes sitting-up exercises.

209
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,502
And now that we've had our moment of fun
and all the better for it,

210
00:13:42,526 --> 00:13:44,017
let's get back to the question.

211
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:48,025
Doesn't this delay call for a cable
to your friend in British East?

212
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:50,402
Mustn't send cables.
Can't you get it through your head

213
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:52,700
that the population down there
has trained noses?

214
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:55,950
They can smell a uranium deal
like a cat smells fish.

215
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,905
But aren't you afraid, Billy,

216
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,833
that when our little party doesn't
show up on the date you said,

217
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:02,705
aren't you a teeny bit afraid

218
00:14:02,796 --> 00:14:05,288
that your friend might use that
as an excuse

219
00:14:05,382 --> 00:14:07,544
to begin negotiations elsewhere?

220
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:10,502
If my friend were looking for an excuse,

221
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,772
he'd find a better one
in the morning papers.

222
00:14:13,515 --> 00:14:14,676
What do you mean?

223
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,679
I'm talking about the untimely demise
of Paul Vanmere.

224
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,935
Well, I'm appalled, Billy.

225
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:27,143
What an unwholesome opinion
you must have of your colleagues

226
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:28,773
to imagine that we...

227
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:31,175
Look here, Peterson, you don't
have to convince me of anything.

228
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,237
You don't care what I think as long
as I don't do anything about it.

229
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:35,244
And I won't.

230
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:38,238
Unless you ever decide to sick
that knife-happy little junkie on me.

231
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,201
What yourself, laddie.

232
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,409
Now, Jack, behave yourself.

233
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:44,336
Sit down.

234
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:47,505
For shame, Billy.

235
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,921
I think you owe an apology
to everybody in this room.

236
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:54,925
And if you're half the gentleman
I know you are, I'm sure you'll make it.

237
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:57,255
As I was saying, Peterson,
you've nothing to worry about.

238
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,426
My friend won't pull out
unless I tell him to.

239
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:03,520
For purely venal reasons,
that's the last thing I have in mind.

240
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:06,565
Jack, give Billy a light.

241
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,195
What a wonderful car.

242
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:23,079
It looks as if it had won the Grand
Prix d'Élégance many years ago.

243
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:26,036
Oh, it did. It was built for Oriposo,
you know, the bullfighter.

244
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,088
He had it made this way
so he could stand up and take bows.

245
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:31,652
He only got one ride in it.
Bequeathed it to me on his deathbed.

246
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:34,384
Well, here's to Oriposo.
I hope you like champagne.

247
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:35,471
You mean it's yours?

248
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:38,639
Well, I gave it to my former chauffeur,
the fat bandit in the front seat.

249
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:40,641
Harry, look at that wonderful villa.

250
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:42,638
Oh, that was Bertie Crampton's.

251
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:45,346
Oh, you mean Lord Crampton
in Gloucestershire?

252
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:48,645
His family acres marched
hand in hand with ours.

253
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,648
Gloucestershire. The cathedral towns,

254
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,606
trout fishing, garden parties.

255
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,281
What a beautiful life.

256
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,950
You know England well?

257
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:00,528
Emotionally, I am English.

258
00:16:00,622 --> 00:16:03,956
I serve tea every
afternoon with crumpets.

259
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,455
And I've always kept up my subscription

260
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,877
to Country Life and the Tatler.

261
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:11,377
The trouble with England,
it's all pomp and no circumstance.

262
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:13,799
You're very wise to get out of it.
Escape while you can.

263
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:16,344
I'd hardly describe myself as escaping.

264
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:18,950
Simply so happened that a relative
of mine, first cousin actually,

265
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:21,591
who died recently happened to be
the owner of a coffee plantation.

266
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:25,053
Africa's the place now. You talk about
the diamond boys, the gold boys,

267
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:26,887
they just skimmed a little off the top.

268
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:30,183
Potential material wealth of Africa
has hardly been scratched.

269
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:31,935
Now there is a villa.

270
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,049
- Mmm. Big.
- That's the Villa Capriccio.

271
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:38,066
Famed in song and story.
A three-star attraction in Baedeker.

272
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,195
Whose is it?

273
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,006
Well, the banks own it now.
Used to be mine.

274
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,115
Yours?

275
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:44,162
Yes. I brought old
Charles from Fouquet's,

276
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,491
you know, the old Fouquet's,
to run it for me.

277
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,371
Then when I decided to pull up stakes,

278
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:50,181
I bought him this restaurant
we're going to.

279
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:52,292
Least I could do to
show my appreciation.

280
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:53,918
Well, here we are.

281
00:16:54,342 --> 00:16:55,628
Charles!

282
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,719
Charles!

283
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,715
Wait here a minute
while I rout old Charles out.

284
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:01,673
He doesn't even know we're in
this neck of the woods. Charles!

285
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,099
Charles!

286
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:06,685
He must think we're
extraordinarily naive.

287
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,182
- Charles!
- Knew all those people.

288
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:10,060
- Owned that vast villa.
- Charles!

289
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,893
Bought this place because
he liked the fellow's cooking.

290
00:17:12,986 --> 00:17:14,227
What utter balderdash.

291
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,904
- Oh, perhaps he did.
- I beg leave to doubt it.

292
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,231
Did you notice his wife?

293
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:20,408
She seemed to be
rather a sensitive little woman.

294
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:22,405
Really embarrassed by all that rot.

295
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:23,702
I am sorry, signore.

296
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,037
As you see, we are closed.

297
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:28,366
We do not open for another two months.

298
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,140
Charles,
what the devil's going on?

299
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,002
This place is falling to rack and ruin.

300
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:34,528
Place is closed. We shall have to dine
in the hotel after all.

301
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:37,504
Monsieur Dann!

302
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,590
Monsieur... Monsieur Dann!

303
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:42,931
Madame.

304
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:45,258
Why did you not let me know
you were coming?

305
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:48,060
Tsk, tsk, you did not say
you were with Monsieur Dann.

306
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:52,144
- Nothing is closed to Monsieur Dann.
- Good to see you again, Charles.

307
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,520
Eh, it's been too long, Monsieur Dann.

308
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:56,773
Not since the night you left the villa.

309
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:01,028
- Remember your farewell party?
- I've tried ever since to forget it.

310
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:04,827
Remember how in the morning
we escorted you to the train

311
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:08,452
with violins playing and everybody cried

312
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:12,876
like when a king you love very much
leaves his country.

313
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:16,080
Aren't you dressed yet?

314
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,541
Do I appear to be dressed?

315
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:21,673
Do dress. Do hurry.
It's a most wonderful day.

316
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:23,846
And Billy wants us to drive out
and see his villa.

317
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:25,969
Uh, his former villa.

318
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,518
Obviously I can't go.
I've got a chill on my liver.

319
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,472
What a miserable place to be ill.

320
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,434
And you forgot to pack
my hot-water bottle.

321
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:37,528
You packed it.

322
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,357
Gwendolen, I distinctly remember...

323
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:43,742
Hello?

324
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,619
Oh, hello.

325
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:47,991
No, I'm afraid we can't.

326
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,721
- Harry has this wretched chill and...
- Uh, give me the telephone.

327
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:54,244
Chelm here.

328
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:55,796
Yes.

329
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:57,792
Quite.

330
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:59,168
Absolutely.

331
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,716
A hot-water bottle.

332
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:04,462
That's very, very good of you, old boy.

333
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,350
Uh, look here, Dannreuther, would you
mind very much if my wife went alone?

334
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:12,428
She enjoys this sightseeing
sort of stuff, you know.

335
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:14,806
Splendid.

336
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:16,356
Splendid. I'll send her along.

337
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:24,197
You know, Gwendolen, nowadays one
simply cannot afford to dismiss people

338
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,946
just because they're not one's sort.

339
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:29,324
One has to try and bridge the gulf.

340
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:31,948
After all, it's a new world
we're going into.

341
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,451
One's got to take it as one finds it.

342
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:37,662
Face it. Use it. Master it.

343
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,656
You know,
I've seen Americans on the street

344
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:13,456
and in the cinema, of course, but,
uh, I've never talked to one before.

345
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,658
Are you a typical American?

346
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,042
I think it's important
that I should know.

347
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,129
Why important?

348
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,332
There are two good reasons
for falling in love.

349
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:27,803
One is that the object of your
affections is unlike anyone else.

350
00:20:28,431 --> 00:20:31,344
A rare spirit, such as Lord Byron.

351
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:35,477
The other is that
he's like everybody else only superior.

352
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:38,264
Harry, for instance,
is the very best of a type.

353
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:40,853
Well, if you must know,
I'm a typical rare spirit.

354
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:43,519
How long did you live here?

355
00:20:43,613 --> 00:20:46,356
Well, the longest I've ever
lived anywhere is two years.

356
00:20:46,866 --> 00:20:48,277
But when you were a child,

357
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:52,203
didn't you ever have a mother and a father
and a house and a street and a town?

358
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:54,655
No, I, uh,
I was an orphan until I was 20,

359
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:57,457
and then a rich
and beautiful lady adopted me.

360
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,788
You know, I've changed my mind
about your being an evil doctor.

361
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,880
You're off to keep a rendezvous some
place in Africa sacred to the tribesmen.

362
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,427
You're going to found a new empire

363
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:12,635
and make yourself master
of the riches of the world.

364
00:21:13,518 --> 00:21:16,431
But you need a beautiful blond queen
to impress the natives

365
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:20,105
as, uh, as the incarnation
of the queen of Sheba.

366
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:22,683
That's why you're making a pass at me.

367
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:25,273
- Am I?
- Of course.

368
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,689
I don't generally go sightseeing
with strange men.

369
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:30,908
You don't believe that, do you?

370
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:33,027
Well, I believe anything you say.

371
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:34,987
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,997
Well, you shouldn't, you know.
You really shouldn't.

373
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:41,327
You can make that pass now.

374
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:10,273
- Mr. Chelm?
- Yes?

375
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:13,734
It is I, Mrs. Dannreuther. Maria.

376
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:14,828
Oh, come in.

377
00:22:16,831 --> 00:22:18,663
Tea for two and two for tea.

378
00:22:19,542 --> 00:22:22,706
Now, that's most awfully kind of you.
You shouldn't have troubled, really.

379
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,627
Billy tells me you have a chill.

380
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:27,001
A bit of one. On the liver.
Too tiresome.

381
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:28,798
- Milk, of course.
- Of course.

382
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,676
Tea and crumpets.

383
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:39,927
That's very good of you.

384
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:41,557
There.

385
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:43,765
Poor Harry.

386
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,308
Chill won't kill him.

387
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:51,147
I feel just now I should like, somehow,
to do him a good turn of some kind.

388
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,323
- You do?
- Well, naturally.

389
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,866
Oh, I see. Naturally.

390
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,285
I think it would be nice if you
were able to do something for him.

391
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:04,081
Help him along.
Give him the benefit of your advice.

392
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,127
Delighted, of course. For instance?

393
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:08,622
Oh, something with business.

394
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,421
He was very pleased
with that tip you gave him

395
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:13,548
on the way home last night
about the gold shares.

396
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:15,595
I've forgotten what I told him.
What was it?

397
00:23:16,557 --> 00:23:19,345
I don't remember either.

398
00:23:19,435 --> 00:23:22,974
I was listening to your voice.
I wasn't listening to what you said.

399
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:28,483
You see, if you were helping him,

400
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:32,153
it would be so much easier for us to
be together a lot out there in Africa.

401
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,483
- Well, has he any head for business?
- Why, he's simply brilliant.

402
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:37,864
I wouldn't have thought it.

403
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:39,320
But of course he is.

404
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:42,706
You don't suppose
I'd marry a ninny, do you?

405
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:46,827
If you imagine that Harry is simply
going to Africa to plant coffee,

406
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:48,537
you're very much mistaken.

407
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:50,710
In point of fact,

408
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:52,215
in point of fact,

409
00:23:52,802 --> 00:23:54,759
coffee is the least
of Harry's interests.

410
00:23:55,763 --> 00:23:58,722
In point of fact,
the land he is acquiring

411
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,300
is extremely rich in certain minerals.

412
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:05,142
Minerals which are indispensable
to the production of atomic energy.

413
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:08,106
Harry's land simply teems with uranium.

414
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:11,561
It wouldn't surprise me to see him
become the uranium king.

415
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:16,027
So you see, my husband isn't
such a ninny as you may have imagined.

416
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:19,443
It might very well be worth your while
to go in with him.

417
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:22,913
The potential mineral wealth of Africa
has hardly been scratched.

418
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,911
That's what I was
telling you last night.

419
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:27,701
But of course. It's a well-known fact.

420
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
Billy boy.

421
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:52,776
- Had a happy day?
- Very.

422
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:56,822
I'm so glad.
What an attractive woman Mrs. Chelm is.

423
00:24:56,908 --> 00:24:58,552
Is that what you called me over
to tell me?

424
00:24:58,576 --> 00:24:59,657
Who are the Chelms?

425
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:02,782
They're English. Going out to British
East. They have a coffee plantation.

426
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:04,158
Any money in coffee?

427
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:07,116
No, but there's a type of Englishman
goes off to coffee plantations

428
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,497
without caring whether
there's any money in it or not.

429
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:12,671
Relatives leave them coffee plantations,
and they go out to them.

430
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,211
But why this sudden interest
in the Chelms?

431
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:18,794
I just like to know who's making friends
with my friends.

432
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:19,888
Well, now you know.

433
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,267
I don't believe one word.

434
00:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,610
You know, if I ever leave you,

435
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:38,905
it will be for someone
of the type of Harry Chelm.

436
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:40,608
Well, bully for you.

437
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:45,071
I suppose that type of Englishman
is like a story I once heard.

438
00:25:45,164 --> 00:25:48,908
An English gardener in England
was showing some Americans

439
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:51,869
one of those wonderful English lawns

440
00:25:51,963 --> 00:25:55,422
and, of course, they wanted to know
how to make a lawn like that.

441
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:57,215
And this English gardener said...

442
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:59,509
He said, "All you have to do
is get some good grass

443
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,587
and roll it every day for 600 years."

444
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:03,593
I heard that story before you were born.

445
00:26:04,225 --> 00:26:06,808
Englishmen tell it
when they're feeling down in the mouth.

446
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:09,641
You just don't understand
the Chelm type.

447
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:13,732
You're not even listening. You never do.

448
00:26:14,277 --> 00:26:17,645
Someday I'll say good-bye
and you won't hear that either.

449
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:22,403
One day I shall really meet my type
and run off with him,

450
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,450
and you'll be simply amazed.

451
00:26:24,537 --> 00:26:25,537
That's possible.

452
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:30,036
George Moore said...
I learned it by heart years ago.

453
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:36,338
He said that, "Each great passion
is the fruit of many fruitless years."

454
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:40,133
George Moore was a very distinguished
English writer, you know?

455
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:42,131
Except that he was Irish.

456
00:26:42,972 --> 00:26:44,258
Cheer up, sugar.

457
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:48,262
I make a million on this deal,
I'll buy you an old English lawn.

458
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:50,309
One we can roll up and take with us.

459
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:57,480
Billy, good morning.

460
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:01,731
What's our wide-eyed Irish leprechaun
doing outside my door?

461
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:04,111
Why do you always make jokes
about my name, huh?

462
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,869
In Chile, the name of O'Hara
is a tip-top name.

463
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:11,073
Many Germans in Chile
have become to be called O'Hara.

464
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:14,751
- Good morning, Mr. O'Hara.
- Madame, my respects.

465
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,584
Perhaps Mr. O'Hara would like
something to drink.

466
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:22,297
Yes. Uh, maybe, perhaps, uh,
a little whiskey, huh?

467
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:23,968
Eh, very weak, please.

468
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,637
What's this visit in honor of?

469
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:27,182
Oh...

470
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,183
Just wanted to have
a little talk with you.

471
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:33,015
Okay, but make it fast.

472
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,439
Fast?

473
00:27:35,316 --> 00:27:36,932
I give you my word, Billy. I...

474
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,227
I give you my word,
I feel to you like a...

475
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:42,354
like an older brother.

476
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:45,440
Oh, it's not so much
the difference of age, it's uh...

477
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,576
it's probably...

478
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:49,369
Yes, the reason is because...

479
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,369
'cause I come from a culture
which is so much older than yours.

480
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:56,827
In my country, a child of six years old

481
00:27:57,254 --> 00:28:00,713
is older in his heart
than you will be at 60.

482
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:04,505
It smokes, it drinks, it philosophizes.

483
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,837
At this rate, I'll be 60
before you get to the point.

484
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,263
Eh, the point.

485
00:28:08,724 --> 00:28:13,014
The, the point is that Peterson,
Ravello, myself...

486
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,970
we are the principles in this case...

487
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:17,014
we are in for the money.

488
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:19,566
We cannot switch around and turn and...

489
00:28:19,652 --> 00:28:20,688
But an agent.

490
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:24,985
It's easy to imagine
that he could conceivably,

491
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:30,945
doesn't feel himself quite as irrevocably
committed as, uh, Peterson or...

492
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,991
We're fellow passengers, I believe.

493
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,253
- Not quite yet, wouldn't you say?
- Too sadly true.

494
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:42,502
By any chance, you... you don't happen
to have seen your Mr. Dannreuther about?

495
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:46,050
I don't think Billy's up yet.
About 11:00. He's rather a late riser.

496
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:49,301
But he said... he said...
Well, anyway.

497
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,382
I shouldn't put too much stock
in what Billy says,

498
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,091
particularly when he's had a few drinks.

499
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:56,225
It's not that he means to break his
word, he just forgets that he's given it.

500
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,021
Charm and dependability
so seldom go in one package.

501
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:00,519
There are exceptions, of course.

502
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,352
Your husband, I imagine
from his manner and behavior, is one.

503
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:06,776
Oh, yes, very. Well, quite, I mean.

504
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,778
I'm so looking forward
to meeting your husband

505
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:10,655
and having a chat about Africa.

506
00:29:10,745 --> 00:29:11,826
By all means.

507
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:14,237
I understand he's in coffee?

508
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,324
You make it sound like total immersion.

509
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:21,166
Part of Africa we're going to
is due for pretty important changes.

510
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:23,167
In my opinion,
things will be booming out there

511
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,964
before you can say, "Jack Robinson."

512
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:28,510
I do hope there won't be too many
changes. It's completely unspoilt, I hear,

513
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:31,009
with some of the loveliest scenery
in the world.

514
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:33,326
I can't imagine anything more lovely
in the way of scenery

515
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,683
than to have a few acres
of gold and diamonds cropping up

516
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,887
on a piece of land
I had bought for a song.

517
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:41,644
Heaven forbid. Next thing,
there'd be big ugly holes everywhere

518
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:45,148
and great, horrid machines
instead of ug... uh, lovely scenery.

519
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,488
Anyway, I don't think
my husband worries much

520
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,566
about money and business,
that sort of thing.

521
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:51,659
Really?

522
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:54,365
I mean, to appreciate
my husband's point of view,

523
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:56,617
one has to understand his background.

524
00:29:57,541 --> 00:30:00,409
Those lawns.
Hundreds of years in the making.

525
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:02,335
Those immemorial elms.

526
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:06,632
Those walls hung with family portraits.
Generations of them.

527
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:08,758
Those great echoing galleries,

528
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,836
where so much of English history
has been made.

529
00:30:12,348 --> 00:30:14,590
Taxes must be terrific
on a place like that.

530
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:18,222
What would people
like the Chelms care about taxes

531
00:30:18,312 --> 00:30:19,644
with their kind of money?

532
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,189
I mean, when a family's been a power
in the City of London for so long.

533
00:30:23,692 --> 00:30:25,854
One of the great financial families.

534
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:27,902
"Power in the city"? You mean...

535
00:30:28,364 --> 00:30:30,401
Oh, yes, of course. One of those Chelms.

536
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:33,278
I'm surprised you know
about them at all.

537
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:36,828
Very few people do.
They prefer to work behind the scenes.

538
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:40,783
I find it rather hard to believe
that a man in your husband's position

539
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:43,744
would go to Africa
just for the coffee planting.

540
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:47,414
You're very quick, aren't you?

541
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,712
In point of fact, he isn't.

542
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:51,919
In point of fact,
he has a very special reason.

543
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:53,924
So I suspected.

544
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:56,677
I has to do with... sin.

545
00:30:58,394 --> 00:30:59,430
Sin?

546
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,854
Since the war, my husband has been
almost exclusively concerned

547
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,681
with spiritual values.

548
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:08,690
He feels is if he can get away there
in the heart of Africa,

549
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:11,028
he will come face-to-face
with essentials.

550
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:14,111
He wants to work out the problem of sin.

551
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:16,701
- Sin?
- Why, yes, of course.

552
00:31:17,329 --> 00:31:19,571
Isn't that what we are all
most concerned with?

553
00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:21,249
Sin?

554
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:25,410
Gwendolen, what are you doing here?

555
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:27,416
I thought we were
supposed to meet on the beach.

556
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:29,338
Uh, Harry, I want you to meet Mr...

557
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:33,044
My name is Peterson. Been having
the most delightful talk to your wife.

558
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:36,096
She tells me you're interested
in spiritual values.

559
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:39,175
- I myself am vastly concerned...
- Harry, we'd really better be going.

560
00:31:39,268 --> 00:31:40,884
You'll excuse us, Mr. Peterson?

561
00:31:41,562 --> 00:31:43,303
What have you been telling that man?

562
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:46,310
Oh, nothing, Harry.
He got onto the subject of religion,

563
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,609
and I just happened to mention
that we usually go to church on Sunday.

564
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,896
Billy, I...

565
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,448
I think it is high time
you take stock of yourself.

566
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:59,702
Can you truthfully say about yourself,
"I, Billy Dannreuther,

567
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:03,657
have acted fairly and squarely
to my associates." Huh?

568
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:07,460
Well, of course he can, Mr. O'Hara.
Everybody knows Billy's the soul of honor.

569
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:08,582
Shut up, sugar.

570
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:12,165
Perhaps he is the "soul of honor,"
and perhaps appearances are deceiving.

571
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:15,002
Do you mind telling me what it is
I'm supposed to have done?

572
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:16,012
Nothing.

573
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:17,720
It's your conduct. Your... Your...

574
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:19,013
Your conduct doesn't...

575
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,718
Your conduct does not
inspire confidence.

576
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:25,724
And confidence, Billy,
is the most important necessity

577
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:27,521
in a undertaking of our kind.

578
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:29,099
One may be completely innocent,

579
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:32,231
but if one's actions invite suspicion,
one might as well be guilty.

580
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:37,157
To be trustworthy is not more important
than to seem to be trustworthy.

581
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,446
Billy, have you done something
you shouldn't have?

582
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,078
Tell me, Billy.

583
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:48,125
Tell me the truth.

584
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:50,161
My conduct.

585
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,749
Who do they think I am, their hired man?

586
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:57,756
But you are, you know.
You are the hired man.

587
00:32:58,055 --> 00:33:00,342
How good and kind of you to remind me.

588
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:03,098
How good. How true.

589
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:04,968
How kind.

590
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,494
Oh, I say, Dannreuther.
Good to see you. How about a drink?

591
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,308
- Well, I, uh...
- Oh, come on, my dear fellow.

592
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,743
Let me buy you a drink.

593
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:31,828
Oh, uh, Gwendolen, don't forget
to send one to Aunt Beatrice.

594
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:35,965
Can't understand it.

595
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:38,464
Gwendolen distinctly said
she'd join me on the beach,

596
00:33:38,554 --> 00:33:40,796
then I come back
and find her sitting in that café.

597
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:42,630
Extraordinary creatures, women.

598
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:44,261
Well, let's drink to them.

599
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:46,217
- Pernod.
- Scotch.

600
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:48,520
Come on, you tiny little wreck.
Have a drink.

601
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:49,846
We're drinking to women.

602
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,442
Take the drink,
but won't join you in the toast.

603
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:56,611
Glass of Irish.

604
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:57,778
Women!

605
00:33:57,865 --> 00:34:00,278
Hitler had the right idea.
Keep them in their place.

606
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:02,951
Babies and the kitchen.

607
00:34:03,495 --> 00:34:05,612
Say what you want to about Hitler,
he had his points.

608
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:08,449
- Come, come. Look here...
- This generation's had its chance.

609
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:12,377
Hitler, Mussolini. Those were the men.
Now is the age of the barbarians.

610
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:15,547
The world's going up in smoke.
I say let it come. Get it over with.

611
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:18,124
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like another year or so of worry.

612
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:20,505
Worry? Just one minute, laddies.

613
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:23,805
I've just two or three words to say
to you, laddies, and that's don't worry.

614
00:34:23,891 --> 00:34:25,177
Don't ever worry.

615
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:27,930
I am in the position
to know secret information.

616
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,387
The Rosicrucians,
the Great White Brotherhood.

617
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:31,688
The high secret orders.

618
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:34,107
But you've no faith!
You must have faith!

619
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:36,150
Faith in power, secret power.

620
00:34:36,236 --> 00:34:38,965
Men who guard the trust from the
deepest insides of the whatchamacallit.

621
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:43,108
Mystic rulers, all one club chained
together by one purpose, one idea!

622
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:45,569
Mankind's champions! Follow me, Billy?

623
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:46,743
Oh, why, of course.

624
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:50,452
This generation's had its chance.
Hitler, Mussolini.

625
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:53,455
- I can't stand here and permit you...
- Are you interrupting me?

626
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:55,411
Relax, Jack. Have another drink.

627
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:59,500
I simply want to state that things don't
happen to be what certain people imagine.

628
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,301
An officer may find himself
strapped for money

629
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:03,799
and he may undertake certain things

630
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:06,882
which in other circumstances,
no, absolutely no.

631
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:09,592
Absolutely. I mean, uh, absolutely no.

632
00:35:09,686 --> 00:35:12,770
In the old days, I should have
simply told people of your ilk

633
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:14,063
to buy their own drinks!

634
00:35:14,149 --> 00:35:15,890
Poor old Jack.

635
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:17,600
I'll teach you.

636
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:23,483
I'll teach you to insult
an ex-officer of the Indian Army.

637
00:35:23,575 --> 00:35:26,192
Well? Are you yellow?

638
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:29,455
The bar.

639
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,157
You're Major Ross?

640
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:33,793
Right.

641
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:37,964
Ross here.

642
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,590
Right.

643
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:41,008
Right again.

644
00:35:42,177 --> 00:35:43,338
Come along. The committee.

645
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:44,920
Saved by the bell.

646
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:53,265
I've never heard such rot in my life.
Sin! Sin!

647
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:55,096
All I could do was
to keep a straight face.

648
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,431
No, I'm certain of it now.

649
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:58,938
These are two very clever
and dangerous antagonists.

650
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:02,566
- Sit here and help me close this.
- But how could they know what we're up to?

651
00:36:02,906 --> 00:36:05,398
Great interests like the Chelms
have ways and means.

652
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:08,530
Yes, and I'm convinced they're out
to get us even before we get started.

653
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,658
We must get ahead of them. Time has
entered the picture in a new way.

654
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:15,116
Never forget the time factor, gentlemen.
It always enters the picture in the end.

655
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,420
I'm sending a cable to London. I want
full information on those Chelm interests.

656
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:21,748
British Africa too.
Check up on his interests there.

657
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:24,195
Every time the plane lands,
I'll try and reach you by telephone.

658
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,926
Keep me informed
of the latest development.

659
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:30,007
Dannreuther, that lying, swinish,
rum-swilling, double-crosser!

660
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,060
- What pleasure it will give me...
- Uh-uh-uh. No, you can't at the moment.

661
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:36,096
We need him right now.
We need that swinish, lying, double...

662
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,931
Did I hear my name?

663
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:40,938
"Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub."

664
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:43,144
Tub?

665
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:44,570
Oh.

666
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,612
Been a change of plan, Billy boy.
You and I are leaving for Africa.

667
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:49,619
How's that?

668
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:52,203
You and I are flying to Africa
by the next plane.

669
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:55,453
What's happened, Peterson? Must be
something important to get you on a plane.

670
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:58,080
Perfectly simple, Billy boy.
The trouble with the oil pump

671
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,753
and the general uncertainty
about when the Nyanga will sail

672
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,001
forces me to sacrifice
my personal comfort.

673
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:06,084
I prefer to fly rather
than run the risk of arriving too late.

674
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:08,761
There's also such a thing
as arriving too early.

675
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:10,338
What do you mean by that?

676
00:37:10,432 --> 00:37:12,992
Well, the land doesn't come up
for auction for a couple of weeks.

677
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:14,621
My friend can't make
his move until then.

678
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:17,058
If we sit around British East
all that time,

679
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:20,185
somebody's going to start wondering
who we are and ask questions.

680
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:22,795
Is that your real opinion, Billy,
or are you just looking forward

681
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:26,483
to a long sea voyage with the attractive
Mrs. Chelm as your companion?

682
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:29,407
- Or perhaps you have even other reasons.
- Such as?

683
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:31,576
That's for you to know
and for us to find out.

684
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,198
You'd better get your packing done.

685
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:39,877
Billy.

686
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:43,792
- Where are you going?
- Off to Africa. Flying.

687
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:45,213
Just like that?

688
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:47,925
Aren't you even going
to kiss me good-bye?

689
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:54,633
I wish...

690
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:56,467
- Don't say it.
- What?

691
00:37:56,562 --> 00:37:57,928
That you wish we'd never met.

692
00:37:58,313 --> 00:38:00,875
You'll be coming on the boat,
and in Africa we'll get together and...

693
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:01,980
I think I hate you.

694
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:04,685
Letting those revolting men
order you about.

695
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:08,196
Don't deny it. I've watched them.
They treat you like a servant.

696
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:10,740
They say "hop it," and off you hop.

697
00:38:12,244 --> 00:38:15,453
I know what it is.
They have a hold on you.

698
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:18,156
Some black secret that could ruin you.

699
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,991
What makes you think that?

700
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:21,496
Oh, it happens all the time.

701
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:24,788
My old Spanish nurse told me
that half the people in the world

702
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:27,464
would be ruined at once
if everyone told what they knew.

703
00:38:28,176 --> 00:38:29,176
But...

704
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,632
couldn't you have them done away with?

705
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,181
Why, you must know plenty of people
who could bump them off.

706
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:38,934
Probably cost a good deal,
but it would be worth it, certainly.

707
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:40,873
Oh, it's not impossible,
except that afterwards,

708
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:43,731
I wouldn't have any money.
This way, I stand to make a lot.

709
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:45,441
- Millions?
- Maybe.

710
00:38:46,903 --> 00:38:49,111
Then perhaps your connection
with those men

711
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:51,610
isn't quite so undignified as I thought.

712
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:56,698
Those millions,
would they be pounds or dollars?

713
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:58,279
Well, either way suits me.

714
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,873
No, that's very careless of you.

715
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:05,203
The state of the pound is so uncertain.
You must think in terms of hard currency.

716
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:08,039
Maybe I should hire you
to handle my affairs.

717
00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:10,170
You could do worse.

718
00:39:10,636 --> 00:39:12,798
I'm awfully intelligent, really.

719
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:15,096
Come along, Billy boy.
The car's waiting.

720
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:34,733
If we can't go faster than this,
we'll miss the plane.

721
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:36,362
Press on! Press on!

722
00:39:44,836 --> 00:39:45,836
Try posting.

723
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,487
Push, push!

724
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,113
Come on.

725
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:25,116
One, two, three!

726
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:55,775
Driver! Driver!

727
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,876
My car!

728
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:57,876
My car! My beautiful car!

729
00:41:58,512 --> 00:41:59,878
- You did that on purpose!
- What?

730
00:41:59,971 --> 00:42:02,759
You planned it that way! I know
what you're up to! I know everything!

731
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:05,057
I know about the uranium
on the Chelm's land,

732
00:42:05,143 --> 00:42:06,805
the Chelm interest in
the City of London.

733
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:09,012
- The what?
- You heard me! The Chelm interest!

734
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:11,438
I take it your information comes
from a reliable source?

735
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:15,485
- It does! From Mrs. Chelm herself!
- Ha, ha, magnificent! Simply magnificent!

736
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,062
You must pay me back
for the loss of my beautiful car.

737
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,177
If you weren't a benighted jackass, if
you could see as far as you could spit,

738
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,137
you'd know there's no such thing
as a "Chelm interest."

739
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,201
You'll have to do better than that,
Mr. Dannreuther,

740
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:28,365
- very much better than that!
- Don't believe me! Check with London!

741
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,917
If you find out he's anything more than
a down-at-heel Gloucestershire squire,

742
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:33,539
you can have my services for nothing.

743
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:37,048
You mean Mrs. Chelm
is an unqualified liar?

744
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:40,715
Well, let's say she uses her imagination
rather than her memory.

745
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:43,888
You will make restitution,
will you no, Mr. Dann?

746
00:42:43,974 --> 00:42:45,465
Either money or a new car.

747
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:48,393
Why, you fat bandit!
I gave you the car in the first place.

748
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:51,846
How I came by it is beside the point.

749
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,775
The fact you gave it to me
doesn't make it any the less mine.

750
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:56,897
Shut up!

751
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:59,400
That's right. Threaten me.

752
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:03,783
It is not enough that you destroy
my beautiful car, now you will...

753
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:09,530
- Stop!
- Hey, stop!

754
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:22,552
More than anything, I want Billy
to make a grand success out there.

755
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:26,005
Ah, as you care so much about money,

756
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,842
I should have thought you would
have left Billy for some rich man.

757
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:31,477
I shouldn't think Billy
would mind, really.

758
00:43:31,897 --> 00:43:34,310
I mean, neither of you
are in love or anything.

759
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:37,145
You are a strange girl.

760
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:39,230
Of course I love Billy.

761
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:41,813
Actually, I adore him.

762
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:45,275
And Billy loves me very, very, but,

763
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:47,277
very much.

764
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:50,954
That's why I trust him
with his little unimportant amours.

765
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,782
And what does he say about yours?

766
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:56,369
But, darling,
all husbands like their wives

767
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,921
to seem attractive to other men.

768
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:06,179
Be sure you explain that to Harry.
I'm going back to the hotel.

769
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:14,186
Mrs. Dannreuther, Maria,

770
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:17,891
I have, I'm afraid,
I have some shocking news for you.

771
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:19,350
The boat is not going at all?

772
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:21,314
There's been a terrible accident.

773
00:44:22,113 --> 00:44:23,820
Your husband's car drove over a cliff.

774
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:26,699
The people on the bus
saw it fall into the sea.

775
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,571
It seems almost certain that he...

776
00:44:28,662 --> 00:44:30,449
What is it? What are you trying to say?

777
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,248
He's saying that Billy is dead.

778
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,913
It's become necessary to redistribute
the stock in our company.

779
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:43,170
Stock, stock!
What good is the stock now?

780
00:44:43,259 --> 00:44:45,967
We can't deal with Dannreuther's friend.

781
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:47,386
Not without Dannreuther.

782
00:44:47,806 --> 00:44:49,763
All the effort, the money.

783
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,263
Everything went over the cliff
with that car.

784
00:44:53,353 --> 00:44:56,687
Ravello, you forget the English
are very sentimental people.

785
00:44:56,773 --> 00:45:00,642
I tell you, there is nothing that
Billy's friend will not do for his widow,

786
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:02,442
and, in black,

787
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:05,320
she's a very touching figure.

788
00:45:06,408 --> 00:45:10,118
Poor Maria, you really have had
a wretched time of it.

789
00:45:10,787 --> 00:45:12,744
You are very understanding.

790
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:16,248
If only there was something I could do.

791
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:19,919
Just now if you could
bring me an aspirin.

792
00:45:20,547 --> 00:45:22,129
- I have a headache.
- Don't move.

793
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:24,172
Just you wait there.
I'll be back in a moment.

794
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:29,549
Mussolini, Hitler, and now Peterson.

795
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,757
A great man. A great loss.

796
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:37,391
I'm going upstairs and read my Bible.

797
00:45:40,108 --> 00:45:41,108
Why all the gloom?

798
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:44,480
Maria has a headache.

799
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:49,863
What's the matter with you?

800
00:45:51,286 --> 00:45:52,402
Go away.

801
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:54,682
My dear girl, I'm as sorry
about Dannreuther as you are.

802
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:57,449
But after all, it isn't as if he was
one of our oldest friends.

803
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:00,455
- I was in love with him.
- He was a very pleasant acquaintance.

804
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:03,583
- What did you say?
- I was in love with him.

805
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:06,336
Really, darling, have you no control
over your romantic fantasies?

806
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:09,339
I loved him! Can't you hear me?

807
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,546
I loved him! I loved him!

808
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:13,972
Oh, rot! You're just dramatizing again.

809
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:17,928
By George, you were right after all!
I did pack it.

810
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:20,349
Oh!

811
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,976
What shall I do?

812
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:25,101
I feel as though I were drowning.

813
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:27,482
He's dead.

814
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:31,990
He's dead, and I'm left
with a fool like you.

815
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:35,240
I tell you what to do.
Have a bit of shut-eye.

816
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,391
You'll wake up in an hour
feeling your old self again,

817
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:38,906
and there'll be no more silly stories

818
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,957
about falling
for a middle-aged roustabout.

819
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:44,169
- So...
- Oh, please go away!

820
00:46:44,255 --> 00:46:45,712
I'll just take these to Maria.

821
00:46:53,264 --> 00:46:57,224
Mr. Chelm, this is very important,
for you as well as for myself.

822
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,018
- Yes, well, get on with it.
- There is now an opportunity

823
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:03,348
for you to secure enormous profits
with virtually no risk.

824
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:05,808
I won't beat about the bush.
Our papers...

825
00:47:06,444 --> 00:47:08,936
For you as Billy's widow,
it will be very easy

826
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,238
to persuade his friend in British East.

827
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:13,816
And for capital, we have Chelm.

828
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,117
He has money?

829
00:47:15,203 --> 00:47:17,616
Money? Enormous.

830
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:19,492
All you have to do is speak to him.

831
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:21,414
No, he would think it bad taste

832
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:23,709
to raise such a question at this moment.

833
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:26,412
I know that type of Englishman
better than you do.

834
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:30,044
Ravello.

835
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:34,221
Ravello.

836
00:47:34,305 --> 00:47:36,763
Quite evidently you've been
misinformed as to my interests,

837
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,690
- as well as to my character.
- Ravello, Ravello! This came from London.

838
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:45,189
"No Chelm family financial interests
London." What does it mean?

839
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:47,141
What does it mean?
It means what it says.

840
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:48,851
There are no Chelm interests.

841
00:48:03,084 --> 00:48:05,997
What's the matter with all of you?
Is somebody dead?

842
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:08,625
Car! It went over a cliff.

843
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:10,456
We thought you had both been killed.

844
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,507
Dannreuther,
I'm delighted to see you're alive,

845
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:14,631
but your wife is in
a fainting condition.

846
00:48:17,307 --> 00:48:19,139
You mean, you're not dead at all?

847
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:21,558
Obviously, I'm not dead.
Please come to your senses.

848
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:23,806
- What have you got here?
- Oh, uh...

849
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:26,351
I knew you weren't dead. I knew it.

850
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:28,979
You couldn't be.
I counted 13 backwards 13 times.

851
00:48:29,068 --> 00:48:31,856
My old Spanish nurse said if you
did that, a miracle would happen.

852
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,396
And you see, it has.

853
00:48:34,574 --> 00:48:38,238
Ladies and gentlemen,
I bring you the glad tidings.

854
00:48:38,328 --> 00:48:42,117
The captain is sober,
and the SS Nyanga will sail at midnight.

855
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:52,840
I can't see it anywhere.

856
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:56,047
What can have happened to it?

857
00:48:56,596 --> 00:48:58,087
My dispatch box. Where it is?

858
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:00,389
A black tin box this size.
What have you done with it?

859
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:05,644
I told you to take
the most particular care of it.

860
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,125
I shall not go on board
until my dispatch box has been found.

861
00:49:08,149 --> 00:49:10,892
- Having trouble, Chelm?
- Nothing I can't cope with, thank you.

862
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:18,775
Says he put it in your cabin,
whatever it is.

863
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:21,281
Idiot!
Why didn't he say so in the first place?

864
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:26,536
Say, look. What's happened to Harry?

865
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,826
He's been giving me the fish eye
all evening.

866
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,206
- Oh?
- What is it?

867
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:33,108
Perhaps it's because when I thought
you were dead,

868
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:34,964
I told him I was in love with you.

869
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:37,134
- You what?
- I couldn't help it.

870
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,337
- It made you seem less dead.
- And?

871
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,423
Oh, he didn't believe me.
He thought my nerves were upset.

872
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:45,760
A sort of delirium.
He thought it quite a joke,

873
00:49:45,853 --> 00:49:49,642
the idea of my inventing a love affair
with a middle-aged roustabout like you.

874
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:52,419
- That's what he called you.
- Now that I'm back in the flesh,

875
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:55,402
he'll begin wondering
about that delirium of yours.

876
00:49:56,447 --> 00:50:00,361
I suppose seeing you alive is different
from thinking of you dead.

877
00:50:00,451 --> 00:50:03,569
Just great. Cooped up on that tub
with a suspicious husband.

878
00:50:08,293 --> 00:50:09,293
Billy.

879
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:15,797
- Let's not go.
- What do you mean?

880
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,679
I'm asking you to run away with me. Now.

881
00:50:22,765 --> 00:50:25,132
What about the millions
in hard currency?

882
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:28,435
What's happened to you? I thought you
were my shrewd little manager.

883
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:30,012
I've changed my point of view.

884
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:33,682
I thought we'd get to Africa
and you'd make your fortune,

885
00:50:33,776 --> 00:50:35,267
and everything would be wonderful.

886
00:50:35,862 --> 00:50:39,196
But now I think it's all too risky.
Too many things can happen.

887
00:50:39,657 --> 00:50:41,489
I want us to cut and
run for it right now.

888
00:50:41,576 --> 00:50:43,488
- You really mean that?
- With all my heart.

889
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:45,570
- Oh, no, that's impossible.
- Why?

890
00:50:45,663 --> 00:50:48,201
Well, for one thing, Mrs. Dannreuther
might not go for the idea.

891
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,123
She's not quite
as sophisticated as you are.

892
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:53,543
Please, Billy, listen to me.
I've thought it all out.

893
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:55,837
We'll take the bus
and catch an express for somewhere...

894
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:58,006
Stop. The shot's not on the table.

895
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:00,588
You're not in love the way I am.

896
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,758
If I loved you a thousand times more
than you say you love me,

897
00:51:03,848 --> 00:51:06,201
it still wouldn't make any difference.
I've got to have money.

898
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:08,433
Doctor's orders are that I must have
a lot of money.

899
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:12,308
Otherwise, I become dull, listless,
and have trouble with my complexion.

900
00:51:12,398 --> 00:51:14,460
But you're not like that now,
and you haven't any money.

901
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:16,316
It's my expectations
that hold me together.

902
00:51:17,904 --> 00:51:20,942
- You really mean that, don't you, darling?
- Sure, I mean it.

903
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:23,069
And your main reason
for wanting lots of money

904
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,971
is so that you'll be ever so attractive
and I'll love you more and more.

905
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:27,486
That's right, baby.

906
00:51:28,373 --> 00:51:30,615
I'll help you, Billy. I can too!

907
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,491
I'm something of a witch.

908
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:35,499
My old Spanish nurse said
I could have been a professional.

909
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:39,044
Don't look now,
but they're raising the gangway.

910
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:56,186
The sea air, ozone. What a pity
we can't bottle it, gentlemen.

911
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:59,359
What a fortune we'd make.
"Neptune's Mixture."

912
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:00,561
Now breathe deeply.

913
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:04,114
Remember, every breath
is a guinea in the bank of health.

914
00:52:09,747 --> 00:52:10,988
Good morning, Chelm.

915
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,700
Why that's good, very good indeed.

916
00:52:14,794 --> 00:52:16,831
I didn't know you were an artist,
Mrs. Dannreuther.

917
00:52:16,921 --> 00:52:20,505
I'd hardly call myself that.
I only dabble.

918
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,503
The nose is not enough long.

919
00:52:22,593 --> 00:52:25,131
- The ears are too small.
- Only has one eye.

920
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:27,554
Now, come along, gentlemen.
We must not dawdle.

921
00:52:38,985 --> 00:52:42,149
Good morning, Mrs. Chelm!
Let's hope she breaks her neck.

922
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:02,289
Mr. Peterson! Mr. Peterson!

923
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:03,624
A radiogram.

924
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:13,642
Hmm.

925
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,859
"No Chelm estate Gloucestershire. Stop.

926
00:53:22,945 --> 00:53:26,939
No landed gentry Chelm."
What do you make of that?

927
00:53:27,033 --> 00:53:29,821
- He's not a Gloucestershire squire.
- Like Billy said.

928
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,995
Just as I was beginning to take Billy
at his face value.

929
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,573
But if he's not what Billy said,
then what is he?

930
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:39,455
We are at sea again, gentlemen,
in more ways than one.

931
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:41,687
- Mystery. More mystery.
- Mmm.

932
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:45,420
Billy is a liar.
Heaven only knows what Chelm is.

933
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:47,923
- CID, maybe?
- You borrowed my thought.

934
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:49,753
What to do? What to do?

935
00:53:49,847 --> 00:53:52,055
The time has come for direct action.

936
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:54,554
You remember last night
when we came on board?

937
00:53:54,644 --> 00:53:57,261
The fuss he was making
about his dispatch box?

938
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:09,864
I love colors.

939
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:13,197
Working with them is an endless puzzle.

940
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,699
Your face, for instance.

941
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,158
Ten minutes ago,
it was all brown and pink.

942
00:54:20,044 --> 00:54:23,458
Now the light is changed,
and it's chalky white.

943
00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:28,417
- What?
- Tinged with green.

944
00:54:29,762 --> 00:54:30,798
Green?

945
00:54:32,765 --> 00:54:35,599
- It must be getting rough.
- Just a little.

946
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:37,680
Don't break the pose.

947
00:54:38,896 --> 00:54:42,515
I don't feel very well.
I think I'll go below and take a pill.

948
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:50,781
- It's incredible. Harry Chelm is just...
- Just Harry Chelm.

949
00:54:50,866 --> 00:54:53,358
Nothing. Nobody.
A ruddy refugee from Earl's Court.

950
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:55,318
With a hot-water bottle. Look.

951
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:58,326
And a letter of introduction
to the secretary of the governor.

952
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:00,908
The secretary, mind you. Disgusting.

953
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:04,086
Purser! My box.

954
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:06,254
Uh, a bit up and down, isn't it, sir?

955
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,458
- It's gone!
- Oh, yes, indeed. Major Ross took it.

956
00:55:09,552 --> 00:55:11,669
I saw him sneak it out of your cabin.

957
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:13,924
I like to keep my eye on
what goes on about the ship.

958
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:16,883
- Where did he take it?
- I believe Mr. Peterson's cabin.

959
00:55:16,976 --> 00:55:18,638
In fact, I'm sure.

960
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:26,109
Ah!

961
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:31,112
Now may I ask what explanation
you have to offer?

962
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:37,494
He forgot his hot-water bottle.

963
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:43,688
- Billy?
- Come in.

964
00:55:45,796 --> 00:55:49,130
- Billy, have you heard what's happened?
- Haven't seen a paper in days.

965
00:55:49,216 --> 00:55:52,004
It's not funny.
They've stolen Harry's dispatch box.

966
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,304
- Who stole his dispatch box?
- That dreadful little major.

967
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,222
He took it to Peterson.
They went through it.

968
00:55:58,643 --> 00:56:00,726
It's all your fault.
I suppose you know that.

969
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:03,053
- My fault?
- The poppycock you've been peddling.

970
00:56:03,147 --> 00:56:06,936
All that junk about the Chelm interest
in London, uranium on your land.

971
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:10,023
Well, in a way, you're the one to blame.

972
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:12,479
- I'm the...?
- I mean, you acted so superior.

973
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:15,448
I was falling in love with you and I...

974
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:18,242
I couldn't bear for you
to think I was just a nobody,

975
00:56:18,329 --> 00:56:21,117
married to the son of a boardinghouse
in Earl's Court.

976
00:56:21,207 --> 00:56:22,789
The... The son of a what?

977
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:26,915
A boardinghouse.
That's what Harry's parents do.

978
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:30,748
They run a boardinghouse
for decayed gentlefolk.

979
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:32,878
But the way he talks, the way he acts,
I thought...

980
00:56:32,968 --> 00:56:35,506
It's just that he sees himself
in a place in the West Country

981
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:39,306
with trout streams and horses,
leading the life of a country squire.

982
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:43,223
It's not his fault if people take it for
granted that he has a place like that.

983
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:44,894
He's never once said that he had.

984
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,098
Country gent, son of a boardinghouse
or whatever he is,

985
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:49,728
I suppose I'd better get his box back.

986
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:52,527
- Oh, he got it back himself.
- Then there's no harm done.

987
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:56,323
Except that Harry's gone to the captain.
He's going to have them put in irons.

988
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:57,826
He is what?

989
00:56:58,411 --> 00:57:00,573
He says that's what they did
in the Royal Marines.

990
00:57:00,663 --> 00:57:04,031
Look here, Skipper, there's a perfectly
simple explanation for all this.

991
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:07,334
I happen to own a dispatch box
which is very similar to Mr. Chelm's.

992
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,753
When I didn't find it in my cabin,
I asked Major Ross

993
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,331
to see if it had been stowed away
somewhere else by mistake.

994
00:57:12,425 --> 00:57:16,009
The major found what he thought was
my box in the saloon with other luggage.

995
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:19,634
The box has been in my cabin
ever since we sailed, under the berth.

996
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:22,888
As soon as I saw the box, of course,
I realized at once that it wasn't mine.

997
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:25,139
I simply opened it to find out
to whom it belonged,

998
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:27,642
so that I could return it
to its rightful owner.

999
00:57:27,732 --> 00:57:30,941
I can't conceive why this gentleman
should imagine I'd be interested

1000
00:57:31,026 --> 00:57:32,892
in a box containing patent medicines.

1001
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:36,151
I'm not a hypochondriac.

1002
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,278
Purser, tell the captain exactly
what you told me about the box.

1003
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:42,869
Why, sir, you asked me whether
I had seen it, and I said

1004
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:46,164
it might be the one I'd seen being
carried along the passage by Major Ross.

1005
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,288
You distinctly told me that
you'd seen it being taken from my cabin.

1006
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:52,246
Oh, you must've misunderstood.

1007
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:54,672
You were rather ill at the time
if you remember, sir.

1008
00:57:54,759 --> 00:57:57,718
- That's all, Purser.
- He's been bribed.

1009
00:57:57,803 --> 00:57:59,419
He's in league with these criminals.

1010
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:03,806
Just a case of a misunderstanding.
That's how I look at it.

1011
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:07,477
Now, what about a little cognac
to wash away any ill feeling?

1012
00:58:07,563 --> 00:58:08,724
I don't care for a drink.

1013
00:58:08,814 --> 00:58:11,147
And let me assure you
that this matter is far from settled.

1014
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:14,129
While rifling through my personal effects,
I feel certain that you must've noticed

1015
00:58:14,153 --> 00:58:16,423
I had a letter of introduction
to the secretary of the governor.

1016
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,134
I suspect he'll be much more
interested in what I have to say

1017
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:21,616
than this gin-soaked,
so-called ship's captain!

1018
00:58:21,702 --> 00:58:25,912
You mind your tongue! Any more insults,
you're the one I put in irons!

1019
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:32,373
As far as I'm concerned,
this is a closed incident.

1020
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:39,186
Chelm, you've got your box back.
Why don't you forget the whole thing?

1021
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,782
What possible interest do you expect
the Colonial Office to take in it?

1022
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:44,826
On the contrary, I expect them to show
considerable interest in a gang of crooks

1023
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,934
who are trying to swindle the country
out of vast uranium deposits.

1024
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:58,024
Just one moment, sir.

1025
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:00,609
What leads you to believe...

1026
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:03,032
This gentleman obviously
hasn't seen fit to inform you

1027
00:59:03,118 --> 00:59:04,905
that during your supposed demise,

1028
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:07,453
he attempted to lure me
into your nefarious venture.

1029
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,783
Unfortunately for you, he acquainted me
with all the pertinent facts,

1030
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:13,196
facts which I intend to communicate
to the proper authority

1031
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:14,836
at the very earliest opportunity.

1032
00:59:16,757 --> 00:59:18,043
I thought you were dead!

1033
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:20,967
That's what they told me.
Everyone told me you were dead.

1034
00:59:21,053 --> 00:59:24,717
And if you were dead,
we had to have fresh capital, didn't we?

1035
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,967
You, Ravello, my own partner,

1036
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,474
sneak out behind my back
and try to cheat me!

1037
00:59:31,564 --> 00:59:33,396
The milk's spilt.
It's no good crying over it.

1038
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:35,849
Get after him, Billy.
Calm him down. Talk to him.

1039
00:59:35,943 --> 00:59:37,796
See if you can't get him
to change his attitude.

1040
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,107
I'll try, but I don't think
it'll do any good.

1041
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:42,425
I don't know why we have to worry
about Chelm's attitude.

1042
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:45,066
Talk's no good.
Conversation never convinced anybody.

1043
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,573
- I say put an end to words!
- Shut up, Jack.

1044
00:59:47,663 --> 00:59:49,905
Time factor has entered
the picture again.

1045
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:52,787
This time, fortunately,
it's working on our side.

1046
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:54,743
Two weeks before we reach port.

1047
00:59:54,837 --> 00:59:58,001
That should be plenty of time
to convince our friend Chelm.

1048
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,629
I beg you, please end all this trouble.

1049
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:02,926
If things go on,

1050
01:00:03,012 --> 01:00:06,221
either you will be done away with
before we ever get to Africa,

1051
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:09,015
or you will leave and denounce
Peterson to the authorities

1052
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:12,765
and that will be the ruin
of all my plans and hopes.

1053
01:00:13,272 --> 01:00:15,834
In the long run, you'll do much better
to get clear of these people.

1054
01:00:15,858 --> 01:00:17,752
- They're thoroughly undesirable.
- "The long run."

1055
01:00:17,776 --> 01:00:19,517
I'm tired of "the long run."

1056
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:24,072
I am not even thinking
about them or about myself.

1057
01:00:24,617 --> 01:00:29,203
- It's only you that concerns me, Harry.
- No need to worry about me.

1058
01:00:29,288 --> 01:00:31,120
Ever since I met you,

1059
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:33,081
you fill my thinking.

1060
01:00:33,918 --> 01:00:36,410
You are becoming an obsession.

1061
01:00:37,504 --> 01:00:39,541
Don't you understand, Harry?

1062
01:00:39,632 --> 01:00:42,625
I am deeply in love.

1063
01:00:43,594 --> 01:00:44,755
Maria.

1064
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:48,341
My dear.

1065
01:01:00,402 --> 01:01:04,362
Only you could make
a woman feel like this.

1066
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:06,610
All I want is to be in your arms,

1067
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,613
now and always.

1068
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:11,903
You forget I'm going
to be done away with.

1069
01:01:11,997 --> 01:01:14,410
Oh, no, no, it will be easy to arrange.

1070
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,991
What you must do is this:

1071
01:01:16,085 --> 01:01:19,453
You will write me a letter...
a love letter.

1072
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:21,833
You will tell me
that you cannot denounce Peterson

1073
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:24,337
because then I will suffer too.

1074
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:29,554
Because you love me so much,
you cannot bear to hurt me.

1075
01:01:30,265 --> 01:01:33,008
Such a letter they will believe
if I show it to them.

1076
01:01:33,686 --> 01:01:36,286
My dear girl, you must see that
this is quite out of the question.

1077
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:38,054
I don't propose to make compromises.

1078
01:01:38,482 --> 01:01:41,475
Not compromises, Harry darling.

1079
01:01:41,568 --> 01:01:45,027
But you can see, if you cause trouble,
the whole of our plans...

1080
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:46,400
my plans...

1081
01:01:48,075 --> 01:01:52,365
You would not want
to make the innocent suffer.

1082
01:01:52,454 --> 01:01:54,616
It would be much better
if you don't interfere, Maria.

1083
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:56,699
I must handle this as I see fit.

1084
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,375
Then you intend to go ahead
with this business?

1085
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:01,623
Tell stories and ruin everything?

1086
01:02:01,714 --> 01:02:03,817
It'll be much better
if you cut loose from these people.

1087
01:02:03,841 --> 01:02:05,798
No happiness can come
from such an association.

1088
01:02:05,884 --> 01:02:10,219
Harry, I'm asking you not to do this.
Please, write a letter.

1089
01:02:10,305 --> 01:02:12,843
Then there will be no trouble for you,
no trouble for us,

1090
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:15,220
no risk when we get to Africa!

1091
01:02:15,686 --> 01:02:18,394
I'm sorry, my dear.
We English are a very pigheaded lot.

1092
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,346
You think you can get away with this?

1093
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,899
But, Maria, my dear,
good Maria, listen...

1094
01:02:22,985 --> 01:02:25,978
First you make love to me.
Now you tell me you will ruin me.

1095
01:02:26,363 --> 01:02:28,425
You'll forgive me,
but it was you who made...

1096
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:31,157
Oh, shut your trap!
Go on! Do what you like!

1097
01:02:31,535 --> 01:02:35,324
You think you're such a brave man.
I'll tell you what you are.

1098
01:02:35,414 --> 01:02:36,871
You are a heel!

1099
01:02:42,254 --> 01:02:43,711
What the blazes now?

1100
01:02:46,967 --> 01:02:48,527
What's happening? What's going on here?

1101
01:02:48,594 --> 01:02:50,697
The oil pump's on the blink.
The electricity's failed.

1102
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:52,713
Utter folly.
A ship lying in darkness this way...

1103
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:54,638
We might well be rammed at any minute.

1104
01:02:54,725 --> 01:02:56,870
I'll tend to this myself.
Which way is the engine room?

1105
01:02:56,894 --> 01:02:59,289
- The passengers are not permitted...
- I'm sure your chief engineer

1106
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:01,930
would welcome the advice
of an ex-officer of the Royal Marines.

1107
01:03:17,539 --> 01:03:19,826
Look here, you fool.
Are we simply abandoned to our fate?

1108
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:22,000
- I insist on something being done.
- For instance?

1109
01:03:22,086 --> 01:03:24,954
Give out the life belts.
Organize the boat drill.

1110
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:27,710
The clientele are requested
to remain calm.

1111
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,320
To remain calm? Does the captain feel
no sense of responsibility

1112
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:31,801
for the lives of his passengers?

1113
01:03:31,887 --> 01:03:34,971
It's my opinion that the captain doesn't
feel much of anything at the moment.

1114
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:36,593
Do you mean to say he's drunk?

1115
01:03:36,683 --> 01:03:38,720
The fellow ought to be made
to walk the plank.

1116
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:40,747
I'm afraid just now
he cannot walk at all.

1117
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:42,707
- Well, this is outrageous...
- Oh, sit down, old man.

1118
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,142
What have you got to worry about?

1119
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:46,850
We're only adrift in an open sea
with a drunken captain

1120
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:49,024
and an engine that's liable
to explode at any moment.

1121
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:52,155
Perfectly ordinary situation.
Happens every day.

1122
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:55,655
But just in case any of you
are still at all anxious,

1123
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:59,158
let it be known that Mr. Chelm has
taken charge in the engine room.

1124
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:01,114
Who's taken charge?

1125
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,541
Harry, and he'll foozle it for sure.

1126
01:04:03,627 --> 01:04:05,038
Shall I get out the hymnbooks?

1127
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:09,089
Your husband claims to have learned
all about the engine and such things

1128
01:04:09,174 --> 01:04:11,461
when he was an officer
in the Royal Marines.

1129
01:04:11,552 --> 01:04:12,918
If he ever was.

1130
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:15,469
In point of fact,
not only was he an officer,

1131
01:04:15,556 --> 01:04:18,890
but he once won a medal for jumping
into a sea of fire to rescue someone.

1132
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,803
It was only a bit of wreckage and not
a man, but that wasn't Harry's fault.

1133
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:24,808
Just a slight error in judgment.

1134
01:04:27,276 --> 01:04:28,983
- Oh.
- The lights, they come on.

1135
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,436
He must have fixed it.

1136
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:33,984
- Impossible.
- The engines are turning.

1137
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:36,817
- We are underway.
- I still say it's impossible.

1138
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:42,451
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention for moment?

1139
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:45,784
I'm happy to inform you that the oil
pump is now in perfect working condition.

1140
01:04:45,878 --> 01:04:47,598
Putting it right was
no great accomplishment

1141
01:04:47,629 --> 01:04:49,429
for anyone with
the slightest mechanical bent.

1142
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:53,045
Anyhow, we may now proceed without
further delay and in absolute safety.

1143
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:58,509
Oh, Harry! You did! You foozled it.

1144
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,388
The pig who wrecked my ship!
Where is he? I'll tear out his liver!

1145
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:04,810
Forward, please.
The captain wants to see you.

1146
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:06,013
There you are.

1147
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:09,474
- You devil. You wreck my beautiful ship!
- Nothing of the sort.

1148
01:05:09,568 --> 01:05:12,686
Some scalawag down there
sabotaged my work out of pure malice.

1149
01:05:12,779 --> 01:05:14,987
You explode my engine!

1150
01:05:15,073 --> 01:05:17,565
Let's all behave like little gentlemen.

1151
01:05:17,659 --> 01:05:20,367
Stay out of this, Dannreuther.
I can handle the brute.

1152
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:24,197
What happens now?
Do we get the life belts?

1153
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,657
Do we abandon the ship?

1154
01:05:26,084 --> 01:05:27,620
There's no immediate danger.

1155
01:05:27,711 --> 01:05:30,078
The passengers will please
to return to the saloon.

1156
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:31,708
We're heading for the nearest port,

1157
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:34,461
and there seems to be some chance
of our making it.

1158
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:36,383
- Right.
- Let's go.

1159
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,470
Come along.

1160
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:46,723
- Now, who was last down?
- Blast!

1161
01:05:50,025 --> 01:05:52,312
Billy boy, be a good fellow
and make a fourth at bridge.

1162
01:05:52,402 --> 01:05:54,394
The major has no head for cards.

1163
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:56,571
A few rubbers will
soothe all our nerves.

1164
01:05:56,657 --> 01:05:58,774
No, thank you.
I'll soothe mine with a double scotch.

1165
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,655
In fact, I think I'll make it a triple.
No ice, no water. That's it.

1166
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,806
How about you, dear Mrs. Dannreuther?

1167
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,322
- A little bridge?
- Oh, so sorry.

1168
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:10,535
I have the most fearful headache.
I think I'll go to my cabin.

1169
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:17,300
Oh, what a shame. Well, boys,
we'll have to make it cutthroat.

1170
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:19,719
What about Harry here?
Maybe he'll take a hand.

1171
01:06:20,138 --> 01:06:23,427
That, under the circumstances,
is a most unsuitable suggestion.

1172
01:06:23,517 --> 01:06:27,136
Gwendolen, I must ask you to either move
to another table or else leave the saloon.

1173
01:06:27,229 --> 01:06:28,845
Oh, Harry, for heaven's sake.

1174
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:32,103
I don't care for my wife to associate
with an associate of criminals.

1175
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:34,559
Don't be absurd. Billy's not a criminal.

1176
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:36,645
He's the best friend
we have on this boat.

1177
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:40,357
- We're not in need of such friends.
- You need any friends you can get.

1178
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,818
The only thing standing between you
and a watery grave is your wits.

1179
01:06:43,912 --> 01:06:46,029
That's not my idea of
adequate protection.

1180
01:06:46,123 --> 01:06:49,161
Purser, how much longer
before this ship reaches port?

1181
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:53,120
If we ever do get to port,
it should be within 14 or 15 hours.

1182
01:06:53,213 --> 01:06:55,921
That's a long time. Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

1183
01:06:56,008 --> 01:06:59,251
Have a drink.
Enjoy the major's piano recital.

1184
01:06:59,886 --> 01:07:01,923
Come on, Peterson. Buy us a drink.

1185
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:04,784
I'm afraid I can't accept
hospitality from persons who I intend,

1186
01:07:04,808 --> 01:07:07,676
in a few hours' time,
to denounce in the face of justice.

1187
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:12,013
- Two spades.
- I admire your sangfroid, Mr. Peterson.

1188
01:07:12,107 --> 01:07:14,895
Or perhaps you don't think I'm serious.
We shall see.

1189
01:07:16,028 --> 01:07:17,269
Three clubs.

1190
01:07:18,947 --> 01:07:20,028
Double.

1191
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:29,076
Gwendolen, are you going to do as I say?

1192
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:32,534
Not when you speak to me in that tone.
Not when you try to order me about.

1193
01:07:33,086 --> 01:07:35,078
- In that case...
- Where are you going?

1194
01:07:35,172 --> 01:07:37,289
On deck, where the air is less polluted.

1195
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:05,032
Purser, four tonics.

1196
01:08:16,171 --> 01:08:18,584
I think you'd better go after Harry.

1197
01:08:18,673 --> 01:08:21,916
Why should I, if he's going to be
so childish and unreasonable?

1198
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,297
Take my advice.
Go to him. Stay with him.

1199
01:08:25,514 --> 01:08:27,972
I suppose you think
we should keep up appearances...

1200
01:08:28,058 --> 01:08:29,890
the loyal wife at her husband's side.

1201
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:34,888
No, Billy. I'm experiencing something
that is rare and beautiful.

1202
01:08:34,981 --> 01:08:37,769
I shall not deny it,
either by word or by deed.

1203
01:08:38,276 --> 01:08:42,145
I love you. Let the whole world know it.
I love you, I love you.

1204
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:45,198
Keeping up appearances
isn't exactly what I meant.

1205
01:08:45,283 --> 01:08:47,491
Why do you want
to send me tagging after Harry?

1206
01:08:47,577 --> 01:08:49,193
He's being such a deadly bore tonight.

1207
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:52,746
- Deadly, but not dead. Not yet.
- What do you mean?

1208
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:55,833
They killed one man just because they
thought he might try get in their way.

1209
01:08:55,919 --> 01:08:59,503
Now handsome Harry here's threatened
to blow the whole thing wide open.

1210
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:02,798
- They killed a man? Really? Who?
- Mm-hmm.

1211
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:04,758
Just a man.

1212
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:09,047
Well,
for all Harry's being too, too tiresome,

1213
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:11,383
and my loving you to distraction,

1214
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:14,135
I still wouldn't want
to see him done in.

1215
01:09:14,438 --> 01:09:16,976
He has some perfectly
darling traits, really.

1216
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:19,523
I mean, like,
always remembering one's birthday.

1217
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:22,773
No, we simply mustn't
let anybody murder Harry.

1218
01:09:22,863 --> 01:09:25,258
Well, keep him in your cabin.
Never let him out of your sight.

1219
01:09:25,282 --> 01:09:27,274
Keep him under lock and key.

1220
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:41,754
Oh, please!
That awful music. It's so loud.

1221
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,456
It comes right into our cabin.

1222
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:46,300
Peterson, tell the major
to soft-peddle it.

1223
01:09:47,554 --> 01:09:49,591
And while he's about it,
he might change the tune.

1224
01:09:49,681 --> 01:09:51,638
Don't you like it?
It's one of my favorites.

1225
01:09:51,725 --> 01:09:53,842
I'm afraid he doesn't know any others.

1226
01:09:53,935 --> 01:09:55,301
Do you, Jack?

1227
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:02,401
Major!

1228
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,948
I love the tinny sound
of a player piano.

1229
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,902
It reminds me of the days of my youth.

1230
01:10:38,063 --> 01:10:41,932
- Do I hear a lady screaming?
- One down.

1231
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:48,279
Captain! Captain!

1232
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:03,919
What happened?

1233
01:11:04,005 --> 01:11:06,918
Oh, Billy, all that screaming...
I thought someone had been killed.

1234
01:11:07,008 --> 01:11:09,320
- Someone nearly was.
- Indeed they were. Look at the major.

1235
01:11:09,344 --> 01:11:11,781
Better get a new act, Peterson.
The curtain's going down on this one.

1236
01:11:11,805 --> 01:11:14,047
Every time I turn my back,
someone makes trouble!

1237
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,420
The passengers break the engine,

1238
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:18,035
they beat each other with fists,
they throw each other overboard!

1239
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:20,769
- That man attacked me.
- Oh, you! You again!

1240
01:11:20,855 --> 01:11:22,642
If I struck him, it was in self-defense.

1241
01:11:22,732 --> 01:11:25,461
He came sneaking up behind me and tried
to run me through with his sword.

1242
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:27,397
- Is that true?
- Well...

1243
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,071
It's no use, Billy,
my trying to protect Harry any further.

1244
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:33,607
I may as well tell the whole truth.

1245
01:11:34,703 --> 01:11:37,195
Captain, it grieves me to confess this,

1246
01:11:37,747 --> 01:11:41,286
but in point of fact,
my husband has an illness of the mind.

1247
01:11:42,085 --> 01:11:44,452
The medical word for it is "paranoia."

1248
01:11:44,921 --> 01:11:48,130
On occasion,
he displays homicidal tendencies.

1249
01:11:48,508 --> 01:11:50,500
The psychiatrists say it's because

1250
01:11:50,594 --> 01:11:52,927
he believes
people are plotting against him,

1251
01:11:53,013 --> 01:11:55,630
and so he strikes back
and tries to kill them.

1252
01:11:55,724 --> 01:11:58,888
Gwendolen! For heaven's sake, woman!
What's the meaning of this treachery?

1253
01:11:58,977 --> 01:12:01,765
Believe it or not, Harry,
I'm doing it for your own good.

1254
01:12:02,522 --> 01:12:04,442
He knows! He saved my life.
He'll tell the truth.

1255
01:12:05,025 --> 01:12:06,391
I wouldn't contradict the lady.

1256
01:12:06,484 --> 01:12:09,067
You wrecked my ship!
You tried to kill the passengers!

1257
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:12,397
But I'm the only sane person on
this ship! It's my word against his!

1258
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,608
Let me go! I'll kill all of you!
I warn you, Captain!

1259
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:20,283
Poor Harry. It's awfully sad.
We've tried everything to cure him.

1260
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,038
How dare you lay hands on me!
You hooligans!

1261
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:28,212
I'll have you put in irons!
You'll be the ones in irons!

1262
01:12:28,298 --> 01:12:31,291
Good. Good.
We've had enough trouble from you.

1263
01:12:32,886 --> 01:12:34,798
Scum! Mongrels!

1264
01:12:34,888 --> 01:12:37,221
I'll bring you to book!
Every one of you!

1265
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:39,048
Every man jack of you!

1266
01:12:41,478 --> 01:12:43,470
After all, it was the only solution.

1267
01:12:44,022 --> 01:12:47,936
Harry's safely locked in his cabin where
those beastly men can't do him any harm.

1268
01:12:48,485 --> 01:12:51,023
On the other hand,
he can't say or do anything now

1269
01:12:51,112 --> 01:12:53,650
to interfere with your making
that fortune in Africa.

1270
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,777
I mean,
the authorities would hardly listen

1271
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:57,904
to the ravings of a lunatic, would they?

1272
01:12:57,994 --> 01:12:59,781
Well, they won't even
let him off the boat.

1273
01:13:00,747 --> 01:13:03,740
Well, in that case, he'll just have
to stay shut up for a few weeks.

1274
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:06,450
It's a bit hard on the old boy,
don't you think?

1275
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:10,879
Yes, but after you've amassed
all those African millions,

1276
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:12,581
we'll make it up to him.

1277
01:13:12,676 --> 01:13:15,043
We'll buy him a country place
in Gloucestershire

1278
01:13:15,136 --> 01:13:17,674
with some rough shooting

1279
01:13:17,764 --> 01:13:20,051
and a trout stream,
like he's always wanted.

1280
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:22,432
Maria will marry him, perhaps.

1281
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:27,180
She seems to have a very real feeling
for English country life.

1282
01:13:27,273 --> 01:13:29,515
And everybody lives happily ever after.

1283
01:13:29,943 --> 01:13:32,606
Especially us, Billy.

1284
01:13:33,071 --> 01:13:35,438
Boat stations, everyone.
Prepare for abandon ship.

1285
01:13:35,532 --> 01:13:38,149
- What's going on?
- I believe, sir, that we are sinking.

1286
01:13:38,243 --> 01:13:39,825
Boat stations, everybody.

1287
01:13:41,663 --> 01:13:42,870
We're sinking.

1288
01:13:44,082 --> 01:13:48,247
Harry! Harry, open the door!
You must! The ship's sinking!

1289
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:50,043
Here. Get back.

1290
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:12,869
We can't! We simply can't leave without
finding out what's happened to Harry.

1291
01:15:12,962 --> 01:15:16,126
Maybe we'll run across him out there.
He's a strong swimmer, isn't he?

1292
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:17,332
Do you really think so?

1293
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:20,463
I don't say we will, but it's possible.
Anything's possible.

1294
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:39,191
- Here, give me that oar.
- Harry!

1295
01:15:44,369 --> 01:15:45,576
Harry!

1296
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:23,944
- Where do you suppose we are?
- Africa.

1297
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:26,650
- What part of Africa?
- Yes, that's important. What part?

1298
01:16:26,744 --> 01:16:29,612
It's not a bad place to land.
No customs, no forms to fill out.

1299
01:16:29,706 --> 01:16:32,073
Tell us at once where we are.
It's important I know.

1300
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,562
Do you mean to say there are
parts of the dark continent

1301
01:16:34,586 --> 01:16:36,546
where you won't be received
like the prodigal son?

1302
01:16:36,588 --> 01:16:37,588
Allejo.

1303
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,546
- What's that?
- Allejo.

1304
01:16:44,804 --> 01:16:46,136
Better get down, everybody.

1305
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:50,382
Get rid of your passports, boys.

1306
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:53,969
Mrs. Chelm, Billy-boy,
my identity must remain a secret.

1307
01:17:39,817 --> 01:17:41,149
Allejo, what's that?

1308
01:17:41,235 --> 01:17:43,818
It was a company that sold arms
to the Arab Legions.

1309
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:45,396
Wait a minute. That rings a bell.

1310
01:17:46,074 --> 01:17:48,566
Some of the equipment
we sold them was defective.

1311
01:17:49,786 --> 01:17:52,369
Been too long under the water
in the Gulf of Leyte.

1312
01:17:52,455 --> 01:17:55,914
The Arabs claimed they lost the war
because of rusty guns and dud ammunition.

1313
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,538
For heaven's sake, be quiet.
If you go on like that, I'll be...

1314
01:17:58,628 --> 01:18:00,915
I'll see you drawn and quartered.

1315
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:24,193
Are you going to allow them
to bully you in this way?

1316
01:18:24,278 --> 01:18:26,861
- Why, it's simply...
- Shocking.

1317
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:30,657
Harry wouldn't have let them do it.
He had a sense of dignity.

1318
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:32,610
I have a sense of survival.

1319
01:18:32,704 --> 01:18:35,492
Billy, what is going to happen?

1320
01:18:35,581 --> 01:18:37,163
Do you think they will torture us?

1321
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,993
Just let them try it.
I'm a British subject.

1322
01:18:40,086 --> 01:18:41,793
I wouldn't say it too loud.

1323
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,482
We shipwreck.

1324
01:19:04,318 --> 01:19:06,776
Big boat go down.

1325
01:19:07,447 --> 01:19:08,483
Bottom ocean.

1326
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:11,740
We take little boat.

1327
01:19:12,869 --> 01:19:16,453
Row all day, row all night.

1328
01:19:17,123 --> 01:19:18,123
Savvy?

1329
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:19,893
Only one way
to deal with these swine.

1330
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:21,874
Walk up to them and kick
'em in the belly.

1331
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:23,577
Show 'em who's boss right away.

1332
01:19:24,213 --> 01:19:26,830
We sight land... your land.

1333
01:19:27,383 --> 01:19:28,749
Praise Allah.

1334
01:19:29,844 --> 01:19:33,463
Come ashore. Suddenly, boom, boom, boom.

1335
01:19:34,348 --> 01:19:36,431
No good way treat shipwreck people.

1336
01:19:37,185 --> 01:19:39,302
You will please to hand over
your passports.

1337
01:19:59,207 --> 01:20:00,743
There seem to be four missing.

1338
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:03,955
Will those who have not handed
over their passports

1339
01:20:04,378 --> 01:20:05,835
hold up their hands?

1340
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:14,257
All left on board ship, Your Excellency.

1341
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:16,259
A terrifying experience.

1342
01:20:16,349 --> 01:20:19,183
An incompetent crew, a burning ship.

1343
01:20:19,268 --> 01:20:21,851
Put overboard in a small boat
at dead of night.

1344
01:20:21,938 --> 01:20:26,023
- What was the name of the vessel?
- The SS Nyanga. She's a Portuguese ship.

1345
01:20:26,109 --> 01:20:29,978
I will investigate whether such a ship
has been reported lost at sea.

1346
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:31,711
Does it stand to reason,
Your Excellency,

1347
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:35,449
we should come to this shore in a small
boat if we'd not been shipwrecked?

1348
01:20:35,535 --> 01:20:39,575
- Our country is in a state of unrest.
- Oh, I am sorry.

1349
01:20:39,664 --> 01:20:45,001
Agents of certain foreign governments
sometimes try to enter it by stealth...

1350
01:20:45,086 --> 01:20:46,044
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1351
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:48,879
hoping to fan the
flames of revolution.

1352
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:54,177
Therefore, we check carefully
on the activities of strangers.

1353
01:20:54,595 --> 01:20:57,804
Surely, Your Excellency,
in our case one look is sufficient

1354
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:00,177
to convince you of our innocence.

1355
01:21:15,074 --> 01:21:16,074
No.

1356
01:21:17,535 --> 01:21:21,028
One look is not enough.

1357
01:21:25,918 --> 01:21:27,758
If you think we're the enemies
of your country,

1358
01:21:27,837 --> 01:21:29,669
the logical thing is to boot us out.

1359
01:21:29,755 --> 01:21:33,339
Send us packing by the first available
boat or train. We shan't object.

1360
01:21:33,426 --> 01:21:35,588
We've got important business elsewhere.

1361
01:21:35,678 --> 01:21:37,135
Where is elsewhere?

1362
01:21:38,055 --> 01:21:39,091
Central Africa.

1363
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:41,757
And what sort of business?

1364
01:21:42,518 --> 01:21:44,510
Vacuum cleaners. Sewing machines.

1365
01:21:44,604 --> 01:21:47,768
Ah, yes. Businessmen.

1366
01:21:48,232 --> 01:21:51,600
All going to Central Africa
to sell vacuum cleaners.

1367
01:21:52,987 --> 01:21:54,569
Hut to hut, I suppose.

1368
01:21:55,615 --> 01:21:57,902
And you, sir, I take it,
are the head salesman...

1369
01:21:58,576 --> 01:22:00,693
the ringleader of this group.

1370
01:22:00,786 --> 01:22:04,951
Oh, no, no group.
We met for the first time on board ship.

1371
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:07,411
Complete strangers to one another.

1372
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:11,370
Liar! The others all look at you
each time I ask a question.

1373
01:22:12,256 --> 01:22:15,545
I am a keen observer.
You four are together.

1374
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:18,252
Oh, no, my fat-gutted friend.

1375
01:22:18,346 --> 01:22:22,807
I'm not the little and simpleminded
native you're fool enough to take me for.

1376
01:22:22,892 --> 01:22:26,932
I am a great man. A serious man.
I spit on you.

1377
01:22:27,813 --> 01:22:29,975
I spit on you and all of your lot.

1378
01:22:30,066 --> 01:22:31,557
Off to the wrong start, Peterson.

1379
01:22:31,651 --> 01:22:33,859
There's only one way
to deal with these swine!

1380
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:36,187
Swine! Swine!

1381
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:38,730
You'd better be careful.

1382
01:22:38,824 --> 01:22:40,690
My husband, my late husband,

1383
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:42,868
who was drowned in the Nyanga disaster,

1384
01:22:42,954 --> 01:22:44,834
happened to be one
of the most important figures

1385
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:47,080
in the British government,
Sir Harry Chelm.

1386
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:51,080
In point of fact, we had letters
from the prime minister and the queen

1387
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:55,210
telling everyone to be particularly
courteous to us and our friends.

1388
01:22:55,633 --> 01:22:58,376
So you see,
if any harm befalls us at your hands,

1389
01:22:58,469 --> 01:23:00,836
it will become
a major international incident.

1390
01:23:01,514 --> 01:23:03,676
Would you instruct that one

1391
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:07,635
that in my country,
a female's lips may move,

1392
01:23:07,728 --> 01:23:09,685
but her words are not heard.

1393
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:11,980
Oh, Harry. Harry.

1394
01:23:13,985 --> 01:23:15,772
If only you were here.

1395
01:23:17,571 --> 01:23:21,315
And, now, sir, you will stop
abusing my intelligence

1396
01:23:21,409 --> 01:23:23,150
and tell me who you really are

1397
01:23:23,244 --> 01:23:26,328
and what is your actual purpose
in being here.

1398
01:23:26,414 --> 01:23:29,373
I'm a sick man. I've got a bad heart.
I mustn't talk anymore.

1399
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:32,576
You refuse to answer.
That is interesting.

1400
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:38,257
It makes a little contest...
a contest in a game at which we excel.

1401
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:43,008
We of this country have had
4,000 years' experience

1402
01:23:43,097 --> 01:23:46,056
in asking questions and getting answers.

1403
01:23:47,351 --> 01:23:50,935
Who are you? Why are you here?

1404
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:54,682
Don't hit me again!
My heart! I'll have an attack!

1405
01:24:21,802 --> 01:24:24,419
Of course, Billy has led
a thoroughly decadent life, but,

1406
01:24:24,513 --> 01:24:27,176
I must say, I thought he had
more backbone than that.

1407
01:24:27,266 --> 01:24:30,350
Backbone.
Either you have it or you haven't.

1408
01:24:31,103 --> 01:24:33,971
You see the beating I took at the hands
of that great, ugly brute

1409
01:24:34,065 --> 01:24:35,522
without even flinching?

1410
01:24:36,108 --> 01:24:39,146
Billy was crazed with fear before
they even laid a finger on him.

1411
01:24:41,322 --> 01:24:45,236
Tell me more about Rita Hayworth.
You really know her very well?

1412
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:48,535
Do I know Rita?
Oh, do I know her.

1413
01:24:48,621 --> 01:24:50,453
I'll give you a letter of introduction.

1414
01:24:50,539 --> 01:24:53,122
She'll fall immediate victim
to your charms.

1415
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:55,246
- You really think so?
- Oh, but certainly.

1416
01:24:55,336 --> 01:24:58,204
A man like you... suave, intelligent,

1417
01:24:58,756 --> 01:25:00,213
darkly handsome.

1418
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:03,420
You have everything,
Ahmed, except money.

1419
01:25:03,969 --> 01:25:05,551
And if you listen to me,

1420
01:25:05,888 --> 01:25:09,256
a boat will be placed at our disposal,
a very slow boat,

1421
01:25:09,725 --> 01:25:12,388
so that Fat Gut's check will have
plenty of time to clear.

1422
01:25:12,478 --> 01:25:14,310
And you would trust me for your share?

1423
01:25:15,773 --> 01:25:18,732
Does one man of the world ask
another to trust his own brother?

1424
01:25:19,276 --> 01:25:22,440
Oh, no, Ahmed.
You'll give me a check for half.

1425
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:26,695
Your demands are very great
under the circumstances.

1426
01:25:26,784 --> 01:25:29,276
Why shouldn't they be?
Fat Gut's my best friend.

1427
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:31,327
I will not betray him cheaply.

1428
01:25:31,997 --> 01:25:34,785
You are certain that you are
the friend of the peerless Rita?

1429
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:37,743
Come, come, Ahmed.
Mind back to business.

1430
01:25:39,422 --> 01:25:41,459
Very well. 50-50.

1431
01:25:41,549 --> 01:25:45,463
Oh, by the way,
Fat Gut's nature isn't noble like ours.

1432
01:25:45,553 --> 01:25:46,760
He might try to bargain.

1433
01:25:46,846 --> 01:25:49,463
I do not bargain
with a puffball like that.

1434
01:25:49,557 --> 01:25:51,139
It's beneath my dignity.

1435
01:25:51,684 --> 01:25:55,769
It'll be dawn soon.
The correct hour for a firing squad.

1436
01:25:55,855 --> 01:25:59,474
But if we have him shot,
what about the money?

1437
01:25:59,567 --> 01:26:02,981
I was just thinking that if he heard
a volley at the psychological moment,

1438
01:26:03,529 --> 01:26:05,521
he might not be so inclined to haggle.

1439
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:09,191
I believe you must have Arab blood.

1440
01:26:09,869 --> 01:26:12,862
Westerners are not usually so subtle.

1441
01:26:26,051 --> 01:26:29,920
Where are you taking me?
I won't go! I demand to see a doctor!

1442
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,551
Would you say that in Paris,

1443
01:26:33,434 --> 01:26:35,221
among smart people,

1444
01:26:35,978 --> 01:26:39,597
the Rolls-Royce or the Cadillac

1445
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:42,353
is considered more chic?

1446
01:26:43,235 --> 01:26:45,443
Well, that's no problem,
no problem at all.

1447
01:26:45,529 --> 01:26:48,021
A man in your position should have both.

1448
01:26:48,115 --> 01:26:49,447
Ah.

1449
01:26:54,955 --> 01:26:58,824
Mr. Dannreuther, I believe,
would like a word with you.

1450
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:01,910
- Billy.
- Sit down, Peterson.

1451
01:27:09,637 --> 01:27:13,051
Uh, I've been talking to Ahmed here,
and, uh...

1452
01:27:19,813 --> 01:27:23,727
It's blackmail. I can't pay.

1453
01:27:28,989 --> 01:27:30,196
What was that?

1454
01:27:31,242 --> 01:27:34,155
Firing squad. It's execution day.

1455
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,162
Will he take a check?

1456
01:28:04,483 --> 01:28:05,894
Billy!

1457
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:10,737
Billy, look! The Nyanga!

1458
01:28:17,371 --> 01:28:20,205
Stay away! Stay away from my ship!

1459
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:24,752
If you try to come aboard,
I will shoot you! I will shoot you!

1460
01:28:24,837 --> 01:28:27,500
Get my gun! Get my gun!

1461
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:30,424
Give it to him.
Maybe he'll shoot himself.

1462
01:28:30,509 --> 01:28:32,842
My gun! My gun!

1463
01:28:48,986 --> 01:28:49,986
Excuse me.

1464
01:28:49,988 --> 01:28:51,756
- Are you Mr. William Dannreuther?
- That's right.

1465
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,466
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if I may.

1466
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:56,449
- Well, I'm sorry. Not now.
- Forgive me, but it's rather important.

1467
01:28:56,535 --> 01:28:59,619
Yes, it always is.
I was a newspaper man myself once.

1468
01:28:59,705 --> 01:29:02,142
Very well, you may quote me as saying
that everybody was heroic,

1469
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:04,203
except Mrs. Dannreuther,
who ate all our boots.

1470
01:29:04,918 --> 01:29:07,956
- Very amusing, but I'm not a reporter.
- Oh?

1471
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:11,461
Jack, go to the phone. Make reservations
for the first plane to Nairobi.

1472
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,550
Six seats.

1473
01:29:12,635 --> 01:29:15,469
Yes, and if they don't have any,
talk to the right man and tell him

1474
01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:18,513
if he kicks other people off the plane,
we'll make it worth his while.

1475
01:29:18,599 --> 01:29:20,261
I always said we ought to take a plane.

1476
01:29:20,351 --> 01:29:23,435
You remember I said that, Mr. O'Horror.
I said, "We ought to take a plane."

1477
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,354
Mustn't dawdle, Billy boy.
A great deal to do and not much time.

1478
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,043
Those are the other
members of your party?

1479
01:29:28,067 --> 01:29:29,649
- Yes.
- I'd like to talk with them too.

1480
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,442
What's it all about?

1481
01:29:31,528 --> 01:29:34,521
I believe you were acquainted
with a Mr. Vanmere, now deceased.

1482
01:29:37,117 --> 01:29:39,860
Peterson. You and the boys
better come back down.

1483
01:29:39,953 --> 01:29:43,742
A gentleman here wants to speak to you,
a Mr. Jack Clayton of Scotland Yard.

1484
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:46,583
You take your wine here
or upstairs, Mr. Dann?

1485
01:29:46,669 --> 01:29:49,503
Oh, we'll have it here.
Care to join us in a drink, Clayton?

1486
01:29:49,588 --> 01:29:51,454
No, thanks.
It's a bit early in the day for me.

1487
01:29:51,548 --> 01:29:54,461
I read somewhere that a Scotland
Yard man never accepts a drink

1488
01:29:54,551 --> 01:29:56,258
from anyone he intends to arrest.

1489
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,586
- Is that true, Mr. Clayton?
- Quite so.

1490
01:29:59,098 --> 01:30:01,590
- Mrs. Dannreuther?
- No, I'm Mrs. Chelm.

1491
01:30:02,601 --> 01:30:05,093
- This is Mrs. Dannreuther.
- How do you do?

1492
01:30:05,646 --> 01:30:07,729
I wouldn't dream
of alarming you lovely ladies.

1493
01:30:07,815 --> 01:30:09,772
So perhaps I'll have a glass of bubbly
after all.

1494
01:30:11,402 --> 01:30:14,236
- Peterson. How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

1495
01:30:14,321 --> 01:30:18,031
Ravello. And Mr. O'Horror.

1496
01:30:18,117 --> 01:30:20,279
O'Hara. Julius O'Hara. Delighted.

1497
01:30:20,869 --> 01:30:22,576
No, I'm the one to be delighted.

1498
01:30:22,663 --> 01:30:25,263
It had begun to look as though I'd never
catch up with you people.

1499
01:30:25,332 --> 01:30:26,852
That would've been a bit embarrassing.

1500
01:30:27,376 --> 01:30:30,665
You see, this is the first time I've
ever been abroad on an investigation.

1501
01:30:30,754 --> 01:30:32,461
I've spent quite a lot of money,

1502
01:30:33,006 --> 01:30:35,919
and my chief can be very sarcastic
about the money one spends,

1503
01:30:36,009 --> 01:30:38,001
particularly if you fail
to deliver the goods.

1504
01:30:38,721 --> 01:30:41,555
Mr. Clayton is presently interested
in the Vanmere murder case.

1505
01:30:42,099 --> 01:30:46,184
The Vanmere murder case. Oh, yes.
That fellow in the Colonial Office.

1506
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:49,434
Yes, I read about that in the paper.
It was a shocking affair.

1507
01:30:49,523 --> 01:30:52,516
According to Mr. Vanmere's
appointment book, Mr. Peterson,

1508
01:30:53,026 --> 01:30:55,546
you had lunch with him at the Savoy
a few days before his death.

1509
01:30:55,612 --> 01:30:59,947
That's quite correct. Mr. Vanmere
was expert on African matters.

1510
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:02,992
We wanted his advice
about affairs in British East.

1511
01:31:03,078 --> 01:31:04,819
Do you recall the subject
under discussion?

1512
01:31:04,913 --> 01:31:09,248
Vaguely. Crop yield.
The native labor situation.

1513
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:12,498
- The inches of rain.
- Vaccination. Shots.

1514
01:31:12,588 --> 01:31:14,329
How long did you know Mr. Vanmere?

1515
01:31:14,423 --> 01:31:17,040
Oh, couple of months.
We met half a dozen times.

1516
01:31:17,134 --> 01:31:19,922
Did he ever make mention
of any enemies, business or otherwise?

1517
01:31:20,012 --> 01:31:22,299
Did he say anything
about romantic attachments?

1518
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:23,596
Did he name any women?

1519
01:31:23,682 --> 01:31:26,675
No. I should have been very surprised
if he had done.

1520
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:30,061
Mr. Vanmere struck me
as being every inch a gentlemen.

1521
01:31:30,147 --> 01:31:31,387
Of course, of course.

1522
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,313
Well, that's all, unless somebody
has anything further to add.

1523
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,146
I have.

1524
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:46,865
You ought to know that the business
of one of these businessmen is murder.

1525
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:52,000
- I beg your pardon?
- Major Ross, I mean.

1526
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:55,663
I can't guarantee that Major Ross
murdered this Vanmere person.

1527
01:31:56,089 --> 01:31:58,832
I assure you, however,
he attempted to murder my husband

1528
01:31:58,926 --> 01:32:00,713
with a long, thin dagger,

1529
01:32:00,803 --> 01:32:04,467
which he always carried about in what
looked like an innocent swagger stick.

1530
01:32:05,057 --> 01:32:06,218
Go on, Mrs. Chelm.

1531
01:32:06,308 --> 01:32:11,474
You see, Major Ross is employed by
Mr. Peterson there to do his dirty work.

1532
01:32:11,814 --> 01:32:13,680
One might say he's a
professional killer.

1533
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:16,857
My husband found out certain things
about Mr. Peterson,

1534
01:32:17,277 --> 01:32:20,111
things, in point of fact,
that are a matter of Empire,

1535
01:32:20,197 --> 01:32:23,690
involving, as they do, a plot to exploit
our kingdom's uranium resources.

1536
01:32:24,368 --> 01:32:27,486
And that's why Mr. Peterson decided
to have him done away with.

1537
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:28,786
Don't run away, Mr. Peterson.

1538
01:32:28,872 --> 01:32:31,740
That's always tantamount
to a confession of guilt.

1539
01:32:32,251 --> 01:32:33,867
Tantamount is what I call it.

1540
01:32:34,670 --> 01:32:36,332
More champagne, Clayton?

1541
01:32:36,797 --> 01:32:37,913
No, thank you.

1542
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:05,907
Should you ever think of me
in Earl's Court, that's where I'll be...

1543
01:33:05,993 --> 01:33:08,531
helping Harry's parents
with the lodgers.

1544
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:12,990
Should you ever think of me,
try not to let it be too harshly.

1545
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:17,498
You kiss her too, Billy,
and tell her she's forgiven.

1546
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:20,838
- Sure, sure.
- Good-bye, Billy.

1547
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:23,792
Bye.

1548
01:33:27,306 --> 01:33:30,094
For Mrs. Chelm.
Just came on the ship's wireless.

1549
01:33:31,602 --> 01:33:33,343
Oh, by the way, Mr. Dannreuther,

1550
01:33:33,437 --> 01:33:36,930
do you know your associates
are all in the hoosegow?

1551
01:33:37,357 --> 01:33:39,440
Oh, not that I'm a bit surprised.

1552
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:42,769
I put them down as thoroughly
bad characters right off the bat.

1553
01:33:43,322 --> 01:33:46,156
But then there are so many
bad characters nowadays.

1554
01:33:46,617 --> 01:33:47,698
Take mine, for instance.

1555
01:33:49,202 --> 01:33:52,366
Harry! He's alive!

1556
01:34:04,259 --> 01:34:05,591
Oh.

1557
01:34:28,867 --> 01:34:31,450
Oh, this is the end.

1558
01:34:35,582 --> 01:34:36,789
The end.
