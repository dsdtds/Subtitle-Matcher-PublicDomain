1
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,980
- Can I come in now?
- No!

2
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:45,747
Well,

3
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,315
- I believe that's everything.
- I hope so.

4
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,575
- Yes, it's a lengthy
business. You must be tired.

5
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:52,445
I'm so excited.

6
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:55,092
I wish we could take the
youngster right home with us.

7
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:57,269
- When do you think we
can expect to get him.?

8
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:57,818
Well it's...

9
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,621
Just a minute.

10
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,026
I'm afraid I forgot something.

11
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,710
You have to sign these.

12
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:07,441
These give admission to check into
every detail of your private life.

13
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,392
- There.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:23,558
Thank you.

15
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,324
Well, that does it I think.

16
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:27,461
I'm sorry to have kept you so long,

17
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,015
but you understand that we
must be most careful.

18
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:33,665
After all, it's a child's life. Our
investigation can't be too thorough.

19
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,106
How long will it be?

20
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,765
- A matter of months
perhaps, but we'll keep you...

21
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,040
- Thank you very much.
Eve dear, we'll be late.

22
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,445
- Good bye and please hurry.
- Adiós.

23
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,050
- Good bye.
- Good bye, thank you.

24
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,242
- Now can I come in?
- Yes.

25
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:18,252
Interview report to the directors.

26
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,219
Names of applicants...
Harry and Eve Graham.

27
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:23,986
She is 32, he's 38.

28
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:28,798
Occupation... traveling salesman
for the Setter Sales Corporation,

29
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,922
dealing in electrical appliances.

30
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:34,090
The company is owned by the Grahams

31
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,095
and was started about four years ago.

32
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:40,947
Mrs. Graham appears to be very
capable. She handles the office work.

33
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:44,595
Mr. Graham covers the Los Angeles area

34
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:48,645
Where they hold a sales franchise
for the deep freeze concern.

35
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:50,971
Their income...

36
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,659
presently about $20,000.

37
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,266
Married... eight years.

38
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,636
They... you don't need to wait
for me. I'll straighten up.

39
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:04,604
No, I tried that once before
and nearly lost my job.

40
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,528
You and your cleaning up.

41
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,740
Go on. You're not disturbing me one bit.

42
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,868
Mrs. Graham is unable to have a family.

43
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,033
Her problem is of undetermined origin,

44
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:19,124
But we'll check several
physicians

45
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,404
who have examined her
during the past eight years.

46
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:24,371
They will take an older child,

47
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:27,338
four, or five years of either sex.

48
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,303
From the preliminary interview,

49
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,030
it's my opinion they
would make fit parents,

50
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,595
But something bothers
me about Mr. Graham.

51
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:37,683
He seemed impatient
during the interview...

52
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,891
a chip on the shoulder sort of attitude.

53
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,818
He behaved rather strangely when signing

54
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:46,304
the permission to investigate form.

55
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,071
Perhaps this is my imagination.

56
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:51,813
I'll report further when I visit
the Grahams home

57
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:53,081
for the
customary inspection

58
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,404
next week.

59
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:57,170
Well that's that.

60
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,976
If all the others was
like you there wouldn't be

61
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,861
any babies given away
in this state at all.

62
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,869
Why are you such an old fuss budget?

63
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,034
If you had made a mistake once

64
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,202
you wouldn't want to
ever let it happen again.

65
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,730
Not where a child is involved.

66
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:18,421
Well,

67
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:20,386
good bye dearie.

68
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:26,095
Eve Graham,

69
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,309
22 Sutter Street,

70
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:32,614
and Harry Graham.

71
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,851
- What goes on?
- I couldn't resist him.

72
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,738
He's the beginning of a collection.
There's a whole army that goes with him.

73
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,625
- But you haven't heard anything yet.
- But we will. You'll see.

74
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,630
Mr. Jordan looks like Santa Claus.

75
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,995
Just like a man who gives babies away.

76
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:17,404
And anyway it's good practice for
you being awakened by mechanical toys,

77
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:21,052
or a teddy bear in the face. Maybe
later on a football in the tummy.

78
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,737
You'll learn to love it.

79
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,064
You will love it, won't you?

80
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:28,350
Of course I will.

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,553
Why do you ask?

82
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,119
Then it's just by imagination.

83
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,485
The other day in Mr. Jordan's office

84
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,850
I thought maybe you were sorry
we'd started the whole thing.

85
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,497
I wasn't sorry. It's just
that Santa Claus was such

86
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,143
a deliberate old codgie he
got on my nerves, that's all.

87
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,308
How about undoing my blouse?

88
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,073
How about getting
yourself pulled together?

89
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,957
This is Tom Morgan's Saturday with us.

90
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,243
- You can do the Caesar salad.
- What else is cooking?

91
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:51,847
Everything you hate.

92
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:54,172
Roast beef rare, potatoes brown...

93
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:55,776
How does that sound, master?

94
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:59,385
Sounds like the perfect wife. Good
in the office, great around the house.

95
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,232
I wonder if it will like him?

96
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,158
Well, if it doesn't I'll keep it myself.

97
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,303
I remember other Saturday afternoons.

98
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,428
When it was always like this.

99
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:20,556
Long time ago.

100
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,958
- This really is a
beautifully planned apartment.

101
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:38,960
Yes, we think so.

102
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,068
Immaculate!

103
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:45,576
- You sure you won't
have something? A Coke?

104
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:47,461
Could I have a glass of milk instead?

105
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,265
- Yes, surely sir.
- Thank you.

106
00:07:49,474 --> 00:07:51,109
My stomach, it's my work...

107
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,390
all the tension.

108
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,784
If you don't mind my
saying so Mr. Jordan,

109
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,843
I think you take your
work much too seriously.

110
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:59,249
- It's not worth it.
- I think it is.

111
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,452
By the way,

112
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:03,740
we've begun our investigation on you.

113
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:07,346
How does it look?

114
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,394
Everybody speaks very highly of you.

115
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,477
But?

116
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:15,967
I've been a salesman
too long not to recognize

117
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:17,814
Sales resistance when
I see it Mr. Jordan.

118
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:20,621
I have a feeling you don't
want us to have the child.

119
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:23,587
I wouldn't say that.

120
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:26,714
Thank you.

121
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:28,919
Well?

122
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,852
I don't know whether I do
or not, at least not yet.

123
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:37,181
I understand you spend a great
deal of time In Los Angeles

124
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,105
- on business.
- Yes, that's right.

125
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,273
Then perhaps you would
give me the names

126
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,356
of some of the people down
there with whom you work.

127
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:45,638
- It's all routine
nothing more than that.

128
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,445
- You're very conscientious
aren't you Mr. Jordan?

129
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:51,254
Well, I'll drop you a line and refer
you to lots of people in Los Angeles.

130
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,661
There's something else about
me I think you should know.

131
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,507
I have a small mole on my right
shoulder. Would you like to see it?

132
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:00,677
- Mr. Jordan, I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's all right. I was early.

133
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:03,524
- What are you two doing in the kitchen?
- Mr. Jordan's been looking us over.

134
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:04,767
I've seen your home.

135
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:08,135
- It's pleasant, very pleasant indeed!
- Won't you stay for dinner?

136
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,401
Thanks, I can't I
have to get back to the office.

137
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,744
Lots more paperwork to do there.

138
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,668
- I'll see you to the door.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:14,831
Good bye, Mr. Graham.

140
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:16,556
Thank you, Mrs. Graham.

141
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:39,651
- What happened between you two?
- I'm sorry.

142
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:41,455
- I don't know hit me.
- Sorry?

143
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,862
He said he liked you but
didn't think you liked him.

144
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,062
Anything else?

145
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:48,712
That we could start fixing up that room,
and he thought I'd be a good mother.

146
00:09:49,404 --> 00:09:50,718
For once Mr. Jordan is right.

147
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:54,045
Well, the star salesman of the Sutter
Corporation had better get on his horse.

148
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,978
What time's your plane?

149
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:57,443
9:15, I've got a date with
a Clark Company

150
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,218
buyer first
thing in the morning.

151
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:01,757
By the time your a father,
just think you can hire

152
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:04,110
one salesman or even two
the way things are going.

153
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,112
- And you can stay
home and run the show.

154
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:07,639
What's this? Are you resigning?

155
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:10,886
- No, I'll be around to heckle a bit.
- That's a woman's privilege.

156
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,130
Now I've got to pack.

157
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,391
No, I'll do it for you,
but there's not much to pack.

158
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:15,417
Everything's in Los Angeles.

159
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:17,503
Don't you ever get a hole in your stock?

160
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,908
And how do the buttons
manage to stay on your shirts?

161
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,191
You never bring them home.

162
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,918
I've found a laundry that does
it, saves a lot of trouble.

163
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,724
I'll only be a minute packing your bag.

164
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,481
Yes, I know Harry Graham very well.

165
00:10:58,731 --> 00:10:59,602
Like him.

166
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,129
He handled our product
for several years until...

167
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,091
Until what?

168
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:05,498
We didn't fire him if that's
what you're getting at.

169
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:06,620
He fired us...

170
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,145
got a better deal.

171
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,746
I see.

172
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:11,753
I'd give my shirt to get Graham back,

173
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:13,356
and you can tell him I said so.

174
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,801
Thank you.

175
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:21,176
Thank you very much.

176
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:36,814
The Grahams wish to adopt a child,
and we must have certain information.

177
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,221
Well isn't that nice.
They want to adopt a baby?

178
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,828
How long has Mr. Graham
made his office here?

179
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,233
I guess about two years.

180
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,640
Where does he live when
he's in Los Angeles?

181
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:52,250
I guess he just lives around...
hotels, motels, wherever he can get in.

182
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,656
It's cocktail time,
honey! Are you with me?

183
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,262
Mr. Jordan, this is Roy Esterly.

184
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,067
I'm very pleased to meet you.

185
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:00,631
What line are you in?

186
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,557
Mr. Jordan is getting some
information on Harry Graham.

187
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,485
Harry's not in any trouble.
Mr. Jordan's not a cop.

188
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:07,968
I'll tell you later.

189
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:11,497
OK, sweetie. You fill him in on Mr.
Exclusive and, when you get through

190
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:13,983
come on back and have
a little shot with me?

191
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:17,551
Excuse me, but could I
ask you a few questions?

192
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,516
Why sure, sure, fire away.

193
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,802
What do you know of Mr. Graham?

194
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:24,047
He's a good guy.

195
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,330
But you called him

196
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,859
- Mr. Exclusive.
- I was kind of kidding I guess.

197
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,889
We never see him except
here in the office,

198
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:32,829
and of course when he's
here he's buried in work.

199
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:36,517
I can't understand how a
guy can live without a little

200
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:37,841
social life.

201
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:41,970
So he's not a playboy like
some cornballs I could mention.

202
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,697
Playboy! He's the
original Invisible Man!

203
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,180
You never see him anywhere.

204
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,110
He's not at the hotels, restaurants,
nightclubs. Man comes to town

205
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,874
and just like that he disappears.

206
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:53,436
Mr. Jordan,

207
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,721
I have an idea.

208
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:56,271
I'm sure Harry will be calling,

209
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:58,089
and you can get everything
you want right from him.

210
00:12:58,339 --> 00:12:59,814
I'll call the hotels for you.

211
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,259
Why don't you just sit
over there at Harry's desk.

212
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:03,622
Thank you, Miss.

213
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,550
Maybe I should see Mr. Graham after all.

214
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,472
Yes, I'll wait.

215
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,201
As long as you're going
to all the trouble,

216
00:13:11,451 --> 00:13:13,326
would you kindly ask

217
00:13:13,896 --> 00:13:16,132
the hotel people when Mr.
Graham was last registered?

218
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:17,737
Surely, I could do that.

219
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,140
Mr. Jordan,

220
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:22,638
your throat must get pretty dry
asking all those questions.

221
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,631
How about a little slug?

222
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:24,792
No.

223
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:25,836
Thanks.

224
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,279
Very kind of you.

225
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,403
No.

226
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:31,169
Bob Vance never called, did he?

227
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:31,652
No.

228
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,615
- That's good because I
don't want to talk to him.

229
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:37,823
Hello?

230
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,389
No, he's in Redland.

231
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,233
He'll be back the day after tomorrow.

232
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:42,837
Yes, I'll have him call you.

233
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,304
Harry Graham.

234
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,352
Harry...

235
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:00,279
Harrison Graham.

236
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:01,399
Good night.

237
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,619
You've really got Harry
Graham on your mind.

238
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,867
I'm sorry I took so long
but the hotels had to check.

239
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,197
It's funny but he hasn't
registered any of them for months.

240
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:18,081
Several of them remember him.

241
00:14:19,014 --> 00:14:20,920
He could be staying at
a rooming house,

242
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,615
but that doesn't sound like him.
He likes everything nice.

243
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,179
You're very kind.

244
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,625
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

245
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:32,557
By the way, is Mr. Graham known
by any other name than Harry?

246
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,722
No, his name is Harry.

247
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,527
Look, Mr. Jordan,

248
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,694
he was in yesterday, and I know
I'll be hearing from him soon.

249
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:41,779
Give me a number and
I'll have him call you,

250
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,984
or maybe you've gotten
everything you need?

251
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:45,708
No, not yet.

252
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:49,798
Excuse me, it's that board.

253
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:51,280
Thank you.

254
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,213
Graham Harrison.

255
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:58,540
Harrison Graham.

256
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,464
132...

257
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:19,389
Wait for me, please.

258
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:39,717
Good evening.

259
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:43,247
Hello, aren't you a
little off your beat?

260
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:46,094
Well, I was coming to Los
Angeles for a meeting tomorrow.

261
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,899
I'm reading a paper at
a welfare convention.

262
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:48,910
How nice.

263
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,747
So while I was here I've been
doing a little checking up on you.

264
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:53,309
Tell me,

265
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:54,915
why are you listed

266
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:56,399
in the telephone book

267
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:57,722
under Harrison Graham?

268
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,409
Harrison Graham's my real name.

269
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:01,692
You changed it?

270
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:05,100
Some time ago. I thought it sounded a
little formal, if you know what I mean.

271
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,107
Yeah, but in San Francisco
you're listed as Harry.

272
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,272
The phone company got it mixed up.

273
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,282
Look, I'm dead on my feet. I just got
home from work a couple of hours ago.

274
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:16,367
Suppose we meet for lunch tomorrow.

275
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,091
Maybe we can learn to get along.

276
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:20,456
Well, I'm busy tomorrow, but...

277
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,266
I'm sorry I bothered you,
but after all it is my job.

278
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,469
That's right, I understand.

279
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,872
- Good night.
- Good night.

280
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,060
It's all right.

281
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,160
You'll wake them both up.

282
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,965
My wife's sick, too.

283
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:07,577
She's in the other room asleep.

284
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:09,782
She's been up with the
baby two nights in a row.

285
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,209
How long has this double
life of yours been going on?

286
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:56,855
8 months.

287
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,782
And you tried to adopt a child!

288
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,273
- What are you going to do?
- Call the police.

289
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:06,514
You can't, not now.
Not with her like this.

290
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:08,843
Please, I've got to try
to make you understand.

291
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:11,811
I can't believe it.

292
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,254
I can't be...

293
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,981
How could a man like you...

294
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,186
successful, admired...

295
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,110
get into a position as...

296
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:22,316
as vile as this?

297
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:23,517
How?

298
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:25,722
I don't know.

299
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:28,932
I don't know how.

300
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:31,619
Loneliness, I guess.

301
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,428
Have you had to spent half
you life living in hotel rooms,

302
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,193
eating in restaurants

303
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,916
with only a newspaper for company,

304
00:19:39,487 --> 00:19:40,761
walking the streets

305
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,726
looking for a movie you haven't seen?

306
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:44,368
Well,

307
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,466
that's the way it was
one Sunday afternoon

308
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:50,143
when I was
stuck in Los Angeles.

309
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:52,990
I couldn't get home to
spend the weekend with Eve.

310
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:55,276
I'd called her,

311
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,080
but we didn't talk about us.

312
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,290
She was in one of her
executive moods... career woman.

313
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,217
You've never seen her that
way. She's different now.

314
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,786
When I got off the phone
I was twice as lonely.

315
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:12,076
I felt as if the walls of the
hotel room were closing in on me.

316
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,125
So, I decided to go out of a walk.

317
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:21,138
Some men on the road
escape their loneliness

318
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,822
with women who are easy to get,

319
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,107
but that didn't work with me.

320
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,117
In all the years of my marriage
I never looked at another woman.

321
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,082
Eve was my whole life.

322
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:35,052
Yet sometimes in those years

323
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:39,062
I felt a distance between
us which was more than miles.

324
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:42,750
When we found out we
couldn't have children,

325
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,758
Eve was bitter and restless.

326
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,526
It was my idea her
coming into the business.

327
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,572
She caught on fast,

328
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,019
so fast she'd doubled
our sales in no time.

329
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,826
And our marriage,

330
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,395
it became a business partnership.

331
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,643
So on that particular Sunday

332
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:06,809
my aloneness

333
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,054
was like a pain.

334
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:13,344
Visit that fabulous Beverly Hills.
It's only $3.25 including tax,

335
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,302
and it'll give you something
to talk about

336
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:16,471
when you get
back to your hometown.

337
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:20,120
Hey, folks the just
about ready to leave.

338
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:23,408
See the homes of all of
Hollywood's greatest movie Stars.

339
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,135
Visit that fabulous Beverly Hills!

340
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,182
It's only $3.25 including tax.

341
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:31,989
It'll give you something to talk about
what you get back to your hometown.

342
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,359
I liked movies, though I really
didn't care where Clark Gable lived.

343
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:39,166
But here were people going someplace,

344
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,051
and I went along with them.

345
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,152
Ladies and gentlemen,

346
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,679
this is glamorous Beverly Hills.

347
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,485
Here are the most
beautiful homes In the world

348
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:59,214
where your favorite stars
of screen live and play.

349
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,918
Over there is the home of a
woman who knows Hollywood best,

350
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,566
a lady who shares her secrets
with millions... Louella Parsons.

351
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:27,080
Thanks.

352
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:29,124
Here we are.

353
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:30,529
On your right

354
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:33,617
is the home of that
shy and modest man...

355
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:36,865
Harvey's friend and
yours... Jimmy Stewart.

356
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:39,872
Now take a look on your left,

357
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:42,960
and you'll see the home
of that funny, funny man

358
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,844
Jack "The Miser" Benny.

359
00:22:56,962 --> 00:23:00,963
Who was Santa Claus
to the whole world...

360
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,166
...Edmund Gwenn.

361
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:03,407
Remember

362
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:05,414
"Miracle on 34th Street?"

363
00:23:05,624 --> 00:23:08,140
That was a wonderful
picture. Did you see it?

364
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,188
You missed something.

365
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:15,759
I'd like to know where my
favorite Neil Francis lives.

366
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,002
What's that?

367
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:20,530
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

368
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:23,858
Haven't you any interest
in how the other half lives?

369
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,304
No, not particularly.

370
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,510
I'm just crazy about bus rides.

371
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,634
Gives me a chance to get off my feet.

372
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,535
And here is a home of a man
who's good with the jokes

373
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:35,807
and a genius at the piano...

374
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,809
...Oscar Levant.

375
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:41,982
I heard him play a Gershwin
concert once. He was just great.

376
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:45,671
What is this, the story of your life?

377
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,900
Were you wondering where
our glamour girls are?

378
00:23:58,391 --> 00:23:59,584
All right, here's your answer.

379
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:00,865
On the right

380
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:03,514
you see the home of that
fine actress Barbara Stanwyck.

381
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,201
The white house, also on the right,

382
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,085
is where lovely Jane Wyman lives.

383
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,590
You know, you just like me
for my lighter, that's all.

384
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:20,715
I could give up smoking.

385
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:24,002
Thanks.

386
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:24,926
Don't mention it.

387
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:32,143
If this is a sample of your work,
you're not very good at pick-ups.

388
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,384
I know.

389
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:36,473
I haven't had very
much experience at it.

390
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,320
This is the first time I
ever tried to pick up a girl.

391
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:41,325
Gee, that's too bad.

392
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,450
I should be better at it.

393
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:45,372
How's that?

394
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:49,104
I'm of those terrible fellows that
frightens the farmer's daughter.

395
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:52,031
I'm a traveling salesman,
only a kind of backwards one.

396
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,880
Yeah, you could use a few tips, like

397
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:59,368
"I'm sad and lonely", just
want someone to talk to.

398
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,216
Don't know any nice girl
in this great big town.

399
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:03,699
How about a few laughs?

400
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,301
You know,

401
00:25:06,595 --> 00:25:09,754
I wanted to say all those things
to you just now, only on the level.

402
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:11,357
Thanks, coach.

403
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,363
Do you mind if I sit here?

404
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,568
There's not much I can
do about it. You're here.

405
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,252
- You know something? I was
a farmer's daughter once.

406
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:21,662
Really?

407
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:22,823
Yeah.

408
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,592
I don't know what it is, but
you don't scare me at all.

409
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,244
Well, thanks for the
use of the lighter. Bye.

410
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:50,251
Just a minute.

411
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:51,935
In case,

412
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:55,464
you ever need a deep freeze my name's
Harry Graham from San Francisco.

413
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:56,666
That's nice.

414
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:59,353
- And mine's Phyllis Martin, from here.
- From here?

415
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:00,886
This doesn't look like
very good farm land.

416
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,200
You told me you were
a farmer's daughter.

417
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,325
Yes, well that was a long time ago.

418
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:05,366
Thanks.

419
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,130
Whoops, doesn't work.

420
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,217
Remember me to Jack Benny.

421
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,943
And there's something else you
should know about traveling salesmen.

422
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:12,955
You kill me.

423
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:15,012
They have very large expense
accounts and frequently

424
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:16,835
buy dinner for pretty
girls they meet on buses.

425
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,401
I must say your style's improving fast,

426
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,128
- but I'm afraid I can't, sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

427
00:26:22,699 --> 00:26:23,812
Yeah, well...

428
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:29,987
Do you like Chinese cooking?

429
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:32,872
Sure, why?

430
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:34,077
Have you changed your mind?

431
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:36,271
I know a place that has
the greatest water chestnuts in town,

432
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,405
if you
can stand water chestnuts.

433
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:39,410
- I'm mad about them.
- Let's go.

434
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:49,153
Early American Chinese...

435
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:50,555
You're going to love it.

436
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,824
Little place isn't it?

437
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:02,786
Cenaremos aquí?

438
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,114
Yes, it's a must. Now why don't you
relax and I"ll be back in a few minutes?

439
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:06,644
Hi Sam.

440
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,480
- Good evening Miss
Martin. Good evening sir.

441
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:10,117
- Will you take care
of the gentleman for me?

442
00:27:10,157 --> 00:27:10,846
Right this way sir.

443
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:13,011
I'll have a drink at the bar
while I'm waiting for the lady.

444
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:19,987
Scotch and soda please.

445
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:37,189
- Here you are sir.
- Thank you.

446
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:03,572
Dinner's ready. Table's over there.

447
00:28:04,744 --> 00:28:06,058
What are we playing, charades?

448
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,983
The offer came with a job. I work here.

449
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,669
- I don't believe any of this.
- The pain will wear off in a minute.

450
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:11,872
Just follow me.

451
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:20,012
Egg soup, very healing. I ordered
the rest of the dinner for you, too.

452
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:22,120
- Aren't you allowed to
sit with the customers?

453
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,618
Maybe later.

454
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:24,102
Go on, eat your soup.

455
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:26,868
It's the only genuine
Chinese dish we serve here.

456
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:29,435
Guy who owns the place used to
run a string of hot dog stands.

457
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:30,598
His name's Hannigan.

458
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:33,284
- You sure you can't sit down?
- No, I can't. Try it.

459
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,490
How is it?

460
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:38,455
Tastes good.

461
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,943
Where are all the people?

462
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:44,391
Sundays are quiet, and
all the rest of the week.

463
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:46,957
- How long you been working here?
- About 6 months.

464
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,084
I needed a job and Hannigan needed
someone to liven up the joint.

465
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:52,370
You can see I've been a howling success.

466
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,896
- Come on, sit down?
- No, I can't.

467
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,144
Where'd you say that farm was?

468
00:28:58,314 --> 00:28:59,185
I didn't.

469
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,151
A little place called Pennsylvania.

470
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,050
- How'd you get all
the way to Los Angeles?

471
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,199
I wanted to see the world.

472
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:06,484
- So you started with China?
- That's right.

473
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,448
- You know something?
- What?

474
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:10,534
They've never heard
of chop suey in China.

475
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:12,218
- You don't say.
- That's right.

476
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:15,185
It's the House Specialty
here, and the next course

477
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,069
If you can stand it.

478
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:24,808
This isn't as nice as Barbara
Stanwyck's but it's closer to my work.

479
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:29,499
Here, let me.

480
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:30,700
Thanks.

481
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:36,554
Well,

482
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:39,042
- thanks for a lovely evening.
- It was nothing.

483
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,646
Drop in again sometime.

484
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,694
- So long.
- You know,

485
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:47,784
we've been together seven hours, and
I still don't know a thing about you

486
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:50,711
except that you're the nicest
stranger I ever met on a bus.

487
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:53,398
I don't know anything about you either.

488
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:56,204
- Let's leave it that way?
- All right.

489
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,214
I will tell you one
thing about myself though.

490
00:30:00,504 --> 00:30:01,375
What's that?

491
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:04,665
On that bus this afternoon I
felt just as lonely as you did.

492
00:30:05,716 --> 00:30:06,587
I feel better now.

493
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:16,533
I guess all traveling
salesmen aren't alike?

494
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,217
Some of us are quite harmless.

495
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:20,582
Yeah, you're kind of special.

496
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,310
Good night.

497
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,125
I never expected to see Phyllis again,

498
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,732
but I knew I'd remember this day

499
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:36,421
when two strangers helped each
other through a lonely Sunday.

500
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:38,466
I felt good again,

501
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,150
not very sleepy.

502
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:45,483
We're ready with your
call to San Francisco.

503
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:46,766
Thank you operator.

504
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:48,448
Eve.

505
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,695
My, two calls in one day!

506
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:53,181
Well never mind darling,
this is deductible business.

507
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:54,584
Monkey business,

508
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:57,792
I cheated on you today. I thought
you should be the first to know.

509
00:30:58,082 --> 00:31:00,318
Haven't you heard, the wife
is always the last to know?

510
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,807
I'm serious, a beautiful brunette,
all curves and soft shoulders.

511
00:31:04,818 --> 00:31:07,496
How wonderful! I hope you'll
be very happy together.

512
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:10,422
What kind of talk is that?
Aren't you even jealous?

513
00:31:11,193 --> 00:31:13,310
You won't spoil my sleep one bit.

514
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:15,555
You're mighty sure of me aren't you?

515
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm very sure of you my darling.

516
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:21,930
She wasn't really beautiful, just
nice, kind of a funny little mouse.

517
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:25,098
- Don't you want to know how I made out?
- I forgot!

518
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:28,747
I heard that Duff's may open three more
retail outlets in Los Angeles county.

519
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:30,551
Got a pencil handy?

520
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:32,355
Better write down this name and address.

521
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,082
Are you listening?

522
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:36,323
Here it is.

523
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,849
He's the merchandise manager.

524
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,576
Yes, I'm listening Eve. I've got it.

525
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:43,422
I wish you were here with me right now.

526
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,468
I didn't even touch her.

527
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:46,508
Touch who?

528
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:48,755
You know, the funny little mouse.

529
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,161
What a shame. Better luck next time.

530
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:54,288
Harry, I got a special
delivery from mother today.

531
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:55,529
What's the news?

532
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:59,741
Father's quite ill. Nothing serious
I suppose, but I'm a little worried.

533
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,910
I wouldn't worry darling.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

534
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:05,073
Eve...

535
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:08,443
I've got to make the rounds.
I'll call you in a couple days.

536
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:10,247
- Good night.
- Good night.

537
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,805
And in a couple of days
I did get home, dead tired

538
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:29,733
and a little bit sick of
the deep freeze business.

539
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:32,741
I only wanted a weekend with Eve,

540
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:36,150
but she had other plans, big plans.

541
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:39,437
Tom Morgan, our lawyer,

542
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:41,081
and Carl Forbes,

543
00:32:41,853 --> 00:32:43,687
who's a buyer for the Redmond chain.

544
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,093
I'd never been able to sell him.

545
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,542
Then Eve decided she'd
try the woman's touch.

546
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,872
Why didn't you ever send your wife in
to sell me? She packs quite a punch.

547
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,598
Haven't you heard? Eve's
the brains, I'm the brawn.

548
00:32:57,449 --> 00:33:01,490
Don't listen to him. I'm just Harry's
little secretary trying to get along.

549
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,615
I was afraid you'd ask
me how the thing worked.

550
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:05,139
Well, how does it work?

551
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:06,542
Would you like some more coffee?

552
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:09,871
No thanks, now tell us all about
the superior mechanical features.

553
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,918
All right, but stop me if this
gets too complicated for you.

554
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:17,088
In the home size there's a special
condenser that eliminates the fan noise

555
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:18,652
and the outside moisture.

556
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:22,261
The single phase motor
it is completely sealed

557
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:26,029
so it has greater efficiency,
and we can prove to you,

558
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,360
that our product will save you,
in electricity, $0.025 per hour.

559
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,205
And the lid is counterbalanced.

560
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,171
We just happen to have
a model in the kitchen

561
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:39,141
and, if you have your combination
Phillips Screwdriver handy Mr. Forbes,

562
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:41,587
I'd be happy to take the
freezer apart for you.

563
00:33:41,716 --> 00:33:42,587
Any questions?

564
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:46,920
No, ninguna, ni demostraciones,
me ha convencido...

565
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:50,489
at least almost. Perhaps
another little brandy?

566
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:53,776
Harry, Mr. Forbes would
like some more brandy.

567
00:33:54,427 --> 00:33:55,298
Harry.

568
00:33:56,673 --> 00:33:58,187
Of course. I'm sorry.

569
00:34:02,126 --> 00:34:03,239
- Tom?
- No thanks, no more.

570
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:04,482
How about a little poker?

571
00:34:05,132 --> 00:34:07,089
The evening's so nice we
might play on the terrace.

572
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,093
- I'm afraid of you, but I'm game.
- Me too.

573
00:34:14,355 --> 00:34:15,428
Come on Harry, let's have at it.

574
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:24,571
I think we're really on our
way. I'm sure we got Forbes.

575
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:26,455
That's the power of a woman for you.

576
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:28,941
I'm so happy.

577
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:30,946
I'm so sleepy. Good night, darling.

578
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,151
Eve.

579
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:36,920
I just figured something out.

580
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:40,409
In the last month we've be
together six days and 14 hours,

581
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,932
not counting when we're asleep.

582
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:44,097
It doesn't make any sense.

583
00:34:46,513 --> 00:34:47,384
Did you hear me?

584
00:34:48,678 --> 00:34:50,353
6 days, 14 hours.

585
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,182
Eve, let's go away tomorrow.

586
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,028
Doesn't matter where, just
as long as we're together.

587
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:08,597
Of course we'll go away sometime,

588
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,165
we'll go to all those glamorous
places that Holliday writes about.

589
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,090
And we'll do it first cabin, too.

590
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:15,854
Let's not wait, Eve.

591
00:35:17,106 --> 00:35:19,223
A marriage is the only
thing that really matters.

592
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:21,588
I love our marriage.

593
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,390
Good night, darling.

594
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:33,536
So I hit the road again,

595
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,823
and when I got back to Los Angeles

596
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,639
One tea coming up. Rice cakes
and your fortune free. Shall we...

597
00:35:46,337 --> 00:35:50,096
- Come on, sit down. Just for once.
- You want me to lose my job?

598
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:56,521
What does it say?

599
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:59,560
You will travel far. That's right on
the button for a traveling salesman.

600
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:00,522
Here's another one.

601
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,371
Money and fortune await
you. That's better.

602
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,612
And the last one.

603
00:36:07,588 --> 00:36:09,383
Dance and the world dances with you.

604
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:10,865
Wow,

605
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,230
things are warming up.

606
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:13,912
Do you like to dance?

607
00:36:14,685 --> 00:36:16,761
I don't know, it's been a long time.

608
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:19,006
Do you want to take a chance with me?

609
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:21,212
All right, when you finish tonight.

610
00:36:21,822 --> 00:36:22,693
Where will we go?

611
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:25,543
Why don't we stay
here? It's so romantic.

612
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:27,627
You're a little character.

613
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:29,632
Miss Martin, over there.

614
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:30,672
Sorry.

615
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,599
See you later.

616
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:38,012
That night we danced.

617
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:42,222
There were other evenings
with Phyllis, too.

618
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:44,869
We asked nothing of each other.

619
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:47,635
I had never kissed her,

620
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,640
never touched her.

621
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,885
Just being together was enough.

622
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,416
But all the time I suppose
we were fooling ourselves.

623
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,101
Ready.

624
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,747
- Good night.
- Good night.

625
00:37:00,836 --> 00:37:01,707
Good night.

626
00:37:08,535 --> 00:37:09,336
Well...

627
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:10,571
- Phyllis.
- Yeah?

628
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,094
Tomorrow's my birthday.

629
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:14,139
Do you want to have dinner
with me, help me celebrate?

630
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,986
I'd love to, and tomorrow's my day off.

631
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:18,630
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

632
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,196
Sure you haven't anything better to do?

633
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:22,959
I'm sure.

634
00:37:23,571 --> 00:37:24,442
OK.

635
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:25,765
Phyllis.

636
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:38,518
Good night, Harry.

637
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:39,840
Good night.

638
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,539
- See you tomorrow then?
- At 7:00.

639
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:49,382
Bye.

640
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:06,506
I spent my birthday trying
not to think of Phyllis.

641
00:38:07,437 --> 00:38:09,272
Still I felt her closeness.

642
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:13,282
I was finding out that I was
not the take it or leave it kind.

643
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,289
I knew then I couldn't see Phyllis

644
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,813
again, that night or any night.

645
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:21,082
I felt like someone who
walks away from the edge

646
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,744
of a cliff
back onto solid ground.

647
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:26,995
I feel pretty low, too,
about walking out on her,

648
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,200
but it was better this way.

649
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:30,642
Much better.

650
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,009
Come in.

651
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,700
Tray's over there.

652
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:45,480
Not much of a way
to spend your birthday.

653
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:47,364
Didn't you get my message?

654
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,090
Well sure I got it. That's
why I came over. I was worried.

655
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,143
What's wrong?

656
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:53,819
Nothing serious, I think I'll live.
Just a headache I couldn't shake.

657
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:54,780
Yeah?

658
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,794
Feels better, lots better.

659
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,159
I brought you a birthday present.

660
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:03,844
It's nothing much,

661
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:05,608
just a Cadillac.

662
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,853
- Why don't you want to open it?
- Sure, I'll open it.

663
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,823
A bit flashy, but I
thought you'd like it.

664
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,111
Smells good. I do like it.

665
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:16,873
Thank you, Phyllis.

666
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,361
Well, may as well put a gift to work.

667
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,404
Just close your eyes now.

668
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,370
We'll take that headache away.

669
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:30,588
It's working already.

670
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:36,763
Many happy returns.

671
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:45,742
You know something?

672
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,870
The headaches all gone.

673
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,275
We're going to have
that dinner after all.

674
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:52,320
No, we're not going anywhere.
You're going to take it easy.

675
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:53,320
Lady,

676
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:55,448
you have healing powers
that are miraculous.

677
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:58,249
I can already hear a soft
piano, champagne corks popping,

678
00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:00,019
and I know just
the place we're going to.

679
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:01,542
We're going to Acapulco.

680
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:04,911
- You're crazy.
- Yes, and I need a shoot, too.

681
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:05,992
Look,

682
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:09,441
I'll go home and get into something
slinky, then pick me up in 15 minutes?

683
00:40:09,652 --> 00:40:11,847
All right, I'll get into
something real uncomfortable.

684
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,999
You kill me.

685
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:20,688
See you.

686
00:40:46,401 --> 00:40:48,075
It's such a lovely night.

687
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,803
This is going to be even
better than the last bottle.

688
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,288
I'm glad your birthday
only comes once a year.

689
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:54,772
This once was worth it.

690
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,138
Acapulco.

691
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:00,185
I never thought I'd make it.

692
00:41:00,636 --> 00:41:02,390
And only 30 minutes from downtown.

693
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,716
You fall in love here,
it goes with the check.

694
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:07,523
- When did you make that up?
- Just now.

695
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:09,086
Have you ever been in love?

696
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:10,768
I've tried it.

697
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,134
You know what I think?

698
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,662
I think you feel in love once, got hurt,

699
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:17,106
and have been running away ever since.

700
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:18,479
Am I right?

701
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,993
I bet you read poems, too.

702
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:24,644
Yeah, he was with the
occupation forces in Germany.

703
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:28,053
You've heard of those Dear John
letters haven't you?

704
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:29,696
Well I got a Dear Phyllis.

705
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:32,021
Seems I lost out to a little Fraulein.

706
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:33,827
I guess all men are no good?

707
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:37,956
I don't know. I think there are one
of two nice ones left in circulation.

708
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,683
Here's looking at you Phyllis.

709
00:41:42,055 --> 00:41:42,926
Thanks.

710
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:55,759
- Well you're a funny one.
- Why?

711
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,686
Don't you want to know if
there's someone in my life,

712
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:00,811
whether I'm married, divorced,

713
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:02,455
or have six children,

714
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,700
wehether I've spent any time in jail?

715
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:06,262
No.

716
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:07,909
Por qué no?

717
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:10,795
What could would it do me if
I did know all those things?

718
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:15,687
I like you as you are, the way we are.

719
00:42:18,223 --> 00:42:19,537
I don't want anything from you,

720
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,104
and I'm afraid of being in love again.

721
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:25,215
You know I'm going away again tomorrow.

722
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:29,986
Tomorrow's a long time off.

723
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:52,638
Eve!

724
00:43:55,296 --> 00:43:56,167
Eve!

725
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:07,475
Eve.

726
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:13,170
- What's wrong?
- Darling, I'm so glad you're back.

727
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,291
What's the matter?

728
00:44:15,505 --> 00:44:16,758
Father's had a heart attack.

729
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:19,024
His condition's critical,
and I have to go at once.

730
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:20,467
Poor baby.

731
00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:22,192
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:22,803 --> 00:44:24,918
He's such a great guy. Do
you want me to go with you?

733
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:29,089
Thanks, but you better stay
here and take care of things.

734
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:30,692
Anyway I got the last seat on the plane.

735
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:31,694
What time?

736
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:34,822
10 o'clock, I change planes
at New Orleans for Miami.

737
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:35,825
What about money?

738
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:38,592
We're out of cash to check.

739
00:44:39,723 --> 00:44:40,594
How was the trip?

740
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,242
Pretty good. We got the Barlow
account, but it took some doing.

741
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:46,454
- Hunt, Hills and Ventura is
complaining about factory deliveries.

742
00:44:46,494 --> 00:44:47,733
I got that all straightened out.

743
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:49,094
Fine.

744
00:44:49,347 --> 00:44:51,503
Well I'll take care of the
office here until you get back.

745
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:54,068
If you need any help,
call. I'll hop a plane.

746
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,234
Maybe he'll pull out of it?

747
00:44:56,684 --> 00:44:57,555
I hope so.

748
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:00,123
I almost forgot.

749
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:04,774
How lovely!

750
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:05,975
You like it?

751
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,301
I'm crazy about it!

752
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:08,664
Put it on for me, will you?

753
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,270
What do I have to thank for this?

754
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:15,681
All that new work with Barlow's or that
cute little mouse you told me about?

755
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:18,768
- Did my boy step out of line?
- Thank me.

756
00:45:19,138 --> 00:45:20,372
And I'll do it like this.

757
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:22,615
Eve.

758
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:24,342
This last trip...

759
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:26,587
It's no good being away from each other.

760
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:29,194
How would you like me to be around
all the time? Could you stand it?

761
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:30,837
- What do you mean?
- One of these days

762
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:32,882
soon we'll put a man on.
I've got my eye on a fellow.

763
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,008
I think I'm going to cry.

764
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:37,934
I should be so happy
if it weren't that...

765
00:45:38,184 --> 00:45:39,297
Finish your packing, darling.

766
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:41,383
I'll make us a couple of drinks.

767
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,747
- I've been thinking about something.
- What is that?

768
00:46:00,397 --> 00:46:03,115
About your being here
with me all the time.

769
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:06,002
I didn't realize home
meant that much to you.

770
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,208
I've been so wrapped up in the business

771
00:46:08,738 --> 00:46:11,655
that I thought you liked
things the way they are.

772
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:14,423
I did, but I've had it.
Now I want to stay put.

773
00:46:14,953 --> 00:46:16,884
- And I was wrong about
something else, too.

774
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:17,229
Wrong?

775
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,800
For nearly four years, ever
since the doctor said no baby,

776
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,286
I hated myself, and you, and everybody.

777
00:46:25,058 --> 00:46:27,614
I was resentful when you
suggested adopting one.

778
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:30,261
I couldn't see taking care
of somebody else's child.

779
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,065
- Remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

780
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:34,589
I was wrong.

781
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,997
What made you think of it
now, after so much time?

782
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:39,723
Maybe it was the telegram from home.

783
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:43,052
I suddenly thought how
much my family meant to me,

784
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:44,294
and how much they loved me,

785
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:48,665
and it seemed selfish not to pass it
along to a little child that needed it.

786
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:49,988
Even if it isn't your own?

787
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,113
That doesn't seem to
make any difference.

788
00:46:52,564 --> 00:46:54,599
- Do you still want one?
- Yes, of course I do.

789
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:57,566
Well then would see maybe about
getting one while I'm away?

790
00:46:57,695 --> 00:47:00,173
Tomorrow morning, the very first thing.

791
00:47:00,543 --> 00:47:03,540
I thought you'd forgotten all about
it, that the business was our baby.

792
00:47:04,192 --> 00:47:06,075
- Will you forgive
me for taking so long?

793
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,029
Yes, I forgive you.

794
00:47:07,118 --> 00:47:10,598
Announcing the departure of
American Airlines flight 516

795
00:47:10,808 --> 00:47:13,404
to Atlanta and New Orleans,
connecting with Miami.

796
00:47:13,574 --> 00:47:14,727
All aboard please.

797
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:15,769
Well, that's us.

798
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,670
So that's how I first
crossed your path Mr. Jordan.

799
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,356
I called you on the phone
wanting to know how to start.

800
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:39,047
We wanted a little boy or a little
girl, Didn't make any difference which.

801
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:42,897
And we wanted it faster than any
child had ever been adopted before.

802
00:47:43,788 --> 00:47:45,823
But you told me it wasn't
as easy as all that,

803
00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:47,627
and how right you were.

804
00:47:47,837 --> 00:47:48,708
Yes.

805
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:52,680
You wanted to ride
roughshod over all our rules.

806
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:56,529
Then what changed you?
What happened after that?

807
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:03,025
I stayed close to the business except
for three flying trips to Florida.

808
00:48:03,435 --> 00:48:05,363
You see Eve's father
had improved, but it

809
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:07,556
took a lot out of her
mother and she collapsed.

810
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,924
It went on month after month. There was
nothing Eve could do except stay there.

811
00:48:12,296 --> 00:48:15,374
It had been over three months
since I'd seen any of our accounts.

812
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,259
The business showed it.

813
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:20,066
I had to make the rounds.

814
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:22,191
I did my work.

815
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:25,519
I didn't see anybody but
the customers in Los Angeles.

816
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:28,567
Of course I thought of Phyllis.

817
00:48:29,097 --> 00:48:30,250
I wanted to see her,

818
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,218
but not the way I saw her the last time.

819
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,581
Anyway,

820
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:39,192
before I left town I dropped
in at the Canton Cafe.

821
00:48:48,263 --> 00:48:49,134
Hi Sam.

822
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:50,500
Hello, Mr. Graham.

823
00:48:50,709 --> 00:48:52,304
- We missed you.
- Thanks, Sam.

824
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:55,190
Miss Marin here? Phyllis?

825
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,236
No, she doesn't work here anymore.

826
00:48:57,806 --> 00:48:58,679
When did she leave?

827
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:01,045
About a month ago, maybe a little more.

828
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:02,487
Was anything wrong?

829
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,813
She says she wasn't
well. See was going away.

830
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,014
Where?

831
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:09,385
She didn't say. Will you have
dinner here tonight, Mr. Graham?

832
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,791
No, no thank you.

833
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,081
Thanks, Sam.

834
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:28,348
Yes?

835
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,315
Is Miss Martin in? Miss Phyllis Martin.

836
00:49:30,485 --> 00:49:31,356
What do you want?

837
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:33,783
My name's Harry Graham.
I'm an old friend of hers.

838
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:34,766
Does
she still live here?

839
00:49:35,216 --> 00:49:36,457
She still lives here, but,

840
00:49:36,497 --> 00:49:39,056
she isn't feeling well.
She doesn't want to see anyone.

841
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,098
Well, I've got to see her.

842
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:41,969
You remember me
don't you? Mr. Graham?

843
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:43,747
I've spoken to you on the
phone several times.

844
00:49:44,438 --> 00:49:47,276
- Y... yes I remember. Come in.
- Thank you.

845
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:51,406
I think she needs you. Her room's
right up there, first on the left.

846
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:05,759
Come in.

847
00:50:09,379 --> 00:50:10,332
Harry.

848
00:50:10,862 --> 00:50:11,733
Hello, Phil.

849
00:50:22,129 --> 00:50:23,042
What's wrong?

850
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:24,644
Nothing.

851
00:50:25,418 --> 00:50:26,932
It's good to see you again.

852
00:50:28,103 --> 00:50:29,618
I just go back from San Francisco,

853
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:31,743
I've been working there
for the last few months.

854
00:50:32,595 --> 00:50:34,309
I went to the restaurant
and they told me.

855
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,437
And I had trouble getting
past your guard downstairs.

856
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:39,442
Well, now that you found me again,

857
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:41,366
how are things in the
deep freeze business?

858
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:43,612
What was it, hot water heaters?

859
00:50:43,902 --> 00:50:44,773
Phyllis.

860
00:50:45,786 --> 00:50:48,464
What did the landlord mean just
now when she said "she needs you?"

861
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:50,386
I don't know.

862
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,070
Come on.

863
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,318
Look, I don't need anybody.

864
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,603
I can take care of myself.

865
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,089
I'm a big girl now.

866
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:06,226
Was it that night?

867
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,351
My birthday.

868
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:10,156
It's yours if that's what you mean.

869
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:12,880
I know.

870
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:15,526
Harry,

871
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,015
you don't have to do anything about it.

872
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:20,139
But I want to do something about it.

873
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,789
No, I don't trap my men this way.

874
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,994
You're free just as you always were.

875
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:27,839
Why didn't you want to see me?

876
00:51:28,249 --> 00:51:29,442
What were you afraid of?

877
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,325
I don't know,

878
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:34,655
I guess maybe I was afraid you
wouldn't want me to have it.

879
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:37,621
I don't think I could stand that.

880
00:51:39,275 --> 00:51:41,150
I never had anything of my own

881
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:42,512
until now.

882
00:51:44,247 --> 00:51:45,281
Don't be afraid.

883
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:47,365
Of course I want you to have the baby.

884
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:49,852
I'll take care of everything.

885
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:52,057
Don't worry.

886
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,392
I've got some things to do.

887
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:00,076
You stay here and rest a while.

888
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:02,161
I'll be back later.

889
00:52:02,812 --> 00:52:03,683
Good.

890
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:05,286
And Phil,

891
00:52:07,664 --> 00:52:08,535
I'm glad,

892
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:10,822
terribly glad I found you.

893
00:52:12,074 --> 00:52:13,027
So am I.

894
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:22,490
You get some rest.

895
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:39,852
Mr Graham, this is Dr. Wallace.
He's taking care of Phyllis.

896
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:42,017
- I was just going up to see her.
- How is she, doctor?

897
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,623
- Could I speak to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

898
00:52:44,752 --> 00:52:45,907
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

899
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:48,633
I think she's going to be all right.

900
00:52:49,604 --> 00:52:51,160
She's had a rough time
of it this last month.

901
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,803
Two transfusions,

902
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:55,128
and she's not very strong to start with.

903
00:52:56,341 --> 00:52:58,737
Then there's the mental
emotional state to contend with.

904
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:00,059
You can understand?

905
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,183
Yes, I understand.

906
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:03,549
I think things will be
better now that you're here.

907
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,837
I'll take care of everything.
Please give her the best.

908
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,922
I'm glad she means something to you.

909
00:53:09,693 --> 00:53:11,247
She can be hurt just
like the rest of us.

910
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:14,696
Fooled me at first with
that flip, hard act of hers.

911
00:53:15,106 --> 00:53:16,500
But that's not the real Phyllis.

912
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,943
You must know that.

913
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,978
How can a man call a
woman his wife for 8 years,

914
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:35,225
someone whom you love and who loves you?

915
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:38,674
That you must have a divorce?

916
00:53:39,725 --> 00:53:40,678
Worse than that,

917
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,804
you've been unfaithful.

918
00:53:43,615 --> 00:53:44,768
You're going to be a father.

919
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,016
How can you hurt someone so much?

920
00:53:55,283 --> 00:53:56,154
Hello?

921
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:57,276
Eve.

922
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,045
Harry, I've been trying to reach you.

923
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:01,487
What is it Eve?

924
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:02,890
Your father?

925
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:04,256
About an hour ago.

926
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:08,225
I'm sorry darling.

927
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:09,867
I'm sorry.

928
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,600
I'll have to stay with mother a
while, and then I'll come home to you.

929
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:18,087
Can you hear me?

930
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,615
Yes, of course I can hear you.

931
00:54:21,506 --> 00:54:22,539
Are you all right?

932
00:54:24,313 --> 00:54:25,868
Yes, I'm all right, Eve.

933
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,113
Give your mother my love and...

934
00:54:29,325 --> 00:54:30,398
And take care of yourself.

935
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:32,252
Good bye.

936
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:33,163
Good bye.

937
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:16,867
Hello, Phyllis.

938
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,035
Hello.

939
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:22,083
I forgot to ask you something.

940
00:55:23,455 --> 00:55:24,729
Yeah? What's that?

941
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,813
Will you marry me?

942
00:55:29,448 --> 00:55:30,319
No,

943
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:32,045
not this way.

944
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:34,411
I'm not asking you.

945
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:35,935
I'm asking you.

946
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,272
I hate to take you out
of circulation like this.

947
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:46,400
There must be a waiting line.

948
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:47,683
There's nothing like that,

949
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:50,208
and no one like you.

950
00:55:52,103 --> 00:55:53,457
Are you sure you want me?

951
00:55:54,869 --> 00:55:55,822
I'm sure.

952
00:55:57,837 --> 00:55:59,351
I do love you, Harry.

953
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:04,203
And I'm so glad I do.

954
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:11,420
I stayed with her until she fell asleep.

955
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:13,746
You may laugh Mr. Jordan,

956
00:56:14,397 --> 00:56:16,592
but for the first time I felt needed.

957
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:20,001
I loved Eve, but I
never felt she needed me.

958
00:56:21,093 --> 00:56:23,048
How did you expect to get away with it?

959
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:24,730
I didn't.

960
00:56:25,704 --> 00:56:27,481
What did you do when Mrs. Graham

961
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:30,106
came home a few weeks after
your other marriage?

962
00:56:31,037 --> 00:56:32,551
Why didn't you tell her plainly?

963
00:56:33,883 --> 00:56:35,077
Wasn't that the plan?

964
00:56:35,648 --> 00:56:36,882
Yes, that was the plan.

965
00:56:37,813 --> 00:56:40,289
That was also the time when
you came in again, Mr. Jordan.

966
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:45,781
Will you have some cream?

967
00:56:46,313 --> 00:56:50,514
I have been away a long time.
I never take cream. Remember me?

968
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:51,757
I'm sorry, I forgot.

969
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,444
I have a surprise for you.

970
00:56:55,054 --> 00:56:55,925
A surprise?

971
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:58,173
A sentimental surprise.
Come on, bring your coffee.

972
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:04,506
Eve...

973
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:06,312
there are some things
we've got to talk about.

974
00:57:06,883 --> 00:57:08,758
Father wanted you to have this watch.

975
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:11,410
It was grandfather's,
and then when father and mother

976
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,209
married It was a
wedding gift to the groom.

977
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:17,499
Grandfather said that having a watch and
chain made a man feel more like a man.

978
00:57:17,629 --> 00:57:19,544
Sort of like a I suppose.

979
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:21,629
I wish I could have thanked him for it.

980
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:24,228
Well he told me to tell
you to take very good care of it,

981
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:26,080
because it should
be passed down to our son.

982
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,167
He said it was a lucky watch and
should be kept in circulation.

983
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,854
Our son...

984
00:57:32,064 --> 00:57:34,260
I'm glad he didn't know
how I'd let you down.

985
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,144
You haven't let me down. You couldn't.

986
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:38,027
Yes I did.

987
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,314
When I learned I couldn't have a child

988
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:44,685
that's when I became the little
efficient white collared girl.

989
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:46,248
I forgot some things.

990
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:48,735
You didn't forget. Maybe
I became absentee husband.

991
00:57:49,105 --> 00:57:51,541
We wanted to show the business
world We were smarter than the rest.

992
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:53,105
And we did show them.

993
00:57:53,475 --> 00:57:56,553
Come on, I've got another
nice surprise for you.

994
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:09,244
The light doesn't work. Leave
the door open so we can see.

995
00:58:09,494 --> 00:58:10,608
I cleaned it up today.

996
00:58:11,019 --> 00:58:12,653
Don't worry about your golf clubs.

997
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,179
I put all our junk in the closet
and I stored the suitcases.

998
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:18,026
I think it's going to be very
nice when we get it fixed up.

999
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:19,710
Go a little slower
Eve, I'm not with you.

1000
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:21,073
Remember Mr. Jordan?

1001
00:58:21,644 --> 00:58:22,515
Mr. Jordan.?

1002
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:26,285
When I left for Florida you said
you'd look into the adoption business.

1003
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:28,131
And you told you about Mr. Jordan.

1004
00:58:29,062 --> 00:58:32,460
Yes, now I remember. I
spoke to him on the phone.

1005
00:58:33,874 --> 00:58:34,745
What about him?

1006
00:58:35,036 --> 00:58:36,190
Well that's the surprise!

1007
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,751
I called him this
morning.

1008
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,600
He said he wanted to see us both,
but he thought he could help us.

1009
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,565
Of course, it may be a while.

1010
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:45,452
So you decided to go
ahead and fix the place up.

1011
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,659
I know it was impulsive,
but I couldn't wait.

1012
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:51,146
I thought we'd put the bed here and,

1013
00:58:51,636 --> 00:58:53,792
the chest of drawers over here.

1014
00:58:53,921 --> 00:58:57,722
And one of those little rubber tubs
In cases he's too small to use ours.

1015
00:58:58,492 --> 00:58:59,363
Like it?

1016
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:04,297
You still do want a child, don't you?

1017
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:08,387
Is adopting a baby
terribly important to you?

1018
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,595
Yes, more important
than I ever knew before.

1019
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:15,204
Except for you, it would
mean everything to me.

1020
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,126
All right then.

1021
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,294
I guess we'll go see Mr. Jordan.

1022
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:27,673
So that's how I crossed
your path once more.

1023
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:29,679
What was in your mind?

1024
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,167
Did you think you could
live this lie for a lifetime?

1025
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:35,061
Well,

1026
00:59:35,101 --> 00:59:38,820
when I realized how much a child
meant to Eve I decided to help her

1027
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,349
by staying married until
the baby became legally ours.

1028
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,594
Then I'd get out of her life.

1029
00:59:45,687 --> 00:59:48,845
I must say, that was both a
gallant and a foolish scheme.

1030
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:05,324
Those were months of panic, fear.

1031
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:09,334
Like the night my son
was born prematurely

1032
01:00:09,424 --> 01:00:10,858
just as the doctor predicted.

1033
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:20,840
Mr. Graham.

1034
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:29,663
Mr. Graham, you have a little boy.

1035
01:00:30,314 --> 01:00:31,869
You can see him through
the window down there.

1036
01:00:59,504 --> 01:01:02,382
The axe began to fall
one day not so long

1037
01:01:02,832 --> 01:01:04,788
ago when I'd just gotten
in from San Bernardino.

1038
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,915
I'd stopped by the office
to clean up my desk.

1039
01:01:08,886 --> 01:01:10,642
It was Eve's and my anniversary.

1040
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:13,288
I had tried to get home,
but I couldn't make it.

1041
01:01:19,472 --> 01:01:21,989
Is there a man in this joint
that's been married 8 years?

1042
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:22,841
Eve!

1043
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:25,357
Don't look so shocked. I'm
your anniversary present.

1044
01:01:27,692 --> 01:01:28,836
I almost didn't find you.

1045
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:31,331
I called all over the state.
And where are you staying?

1046
01:01:32,223 --> 01:01:34,179
I'm not. I just got
back from San Bernardino.

1047
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:35,462
Did you get my flowers?

1048
01:01:35,551 --> 01:01:36,900
I didn't wait for that.
I got your wire

1049
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,429
and decided something
should be done about it.

1050
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:40,273
So here I am, aren't you glad?

1051
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:42,077
I was just about to call you.

1052
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:45,967
Never mind that. How about, closing
up the store and buying me a dinner?

1053
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:49,416
As a matter of fact we're doing so
well I'll put it on the expense account.

1054
01:01:49,585 --> 01:01:51,460
Let's get started on our ninth year.

1055
01:01:57,524 --> 01:01:58,517
After dinner

1056
01:01:58,727 --> 01:02:00,081
Eve wanted to take a walk.

1057
01:02:00,211 --> 01:02:02,006
I was afraid every step of the way.

1058
01:02:02,296 --> 01:02:04,932
Yet I tried to get into the
holiday spirit for her sake.

1059
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,740
For a moment it was
like old times, until...

1060
01:02:07,949 --> 01:02:08,820
Mr. Graham!

1061
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,947
If you're going home,
could you give me a lift?

1062
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,333
Some other time.

1063
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:15,897
See you Ricky.

1064
01:02:19,395 --> 01:02:20,266
Who's he?

1065
01:02:20,878 --> 01:02:23,716
Store executive's son. I have
dinner at that place now and then.

1066
01:02:24,928 --> 01:02:26,683
What did he mean by home?

1067
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,929
The Chapin Park Hotel.

1068
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,216
I stayed there a while
back. They live nearby.

1069
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,304
How about a nightcap?

1070
01:02:35,915 --> 01:02:36,786
Love it.

1071
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,846
After I put Eve on the
plane for San Francisco

1072
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:48,776
I came home to Phyllis and
more of my insane double life.

1073
01:02:49,788 --> 01:02:52,064
I was beginning to act
and think like a criminal,

1074
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,109
afraid to be found out

1075
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:56,916
yet sick of deceit and lies.

1076
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:01,805
Hello Phil.

1077
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:07,490
Danny asleep?

1078
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:08,934
That's right.

1079
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,423
All right, Phil. Out with it.

1080
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:15,431
- Surprised you came back.
- What do you mean?

1081
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:17,354
Let it go.

1082
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:21,125
No Phil, I won't let it
go. I want you to tell me.

1083
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:22,807
All right,

1084
01:03:24,141 --> 01:03:26,297
if you must know I'm feeling
a little cheap, that's all.

1085
01:03:28,552 --> 01:03:29,423
Ricky?

1086
01:03:29,955 --> 01:03:31,189
Worse than that... Ricky's mother.

1087
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,755
She couldn't wait to phone
me all the grisly details.

1088
01:03:34,205 --> 01:03:37,444
Made a wonderful story out of it.
You know, just like the Sunday papers.

1089
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:39,769
"Husband supposed to be out of town

1090
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:42,657
secretly meets another woman."

1091
01:03:43,588 --> 01:03:45,263
You might have done a
neater job of it Harry.

1092
01:03:45,713 --> 01:03:46,584
Yes...

1093
01:03:47,197 --> 01:03:48,068
yes, you're right.

1094
01:03:49,843 --> 01:03:51,758
Getting awfully excited
over one, aren't I?

1095
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:53,483
There must have been others.

1096
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:54,966
No, no others.

1097
01:03:55,497 --> 01:03:56,450
That's a comfort.

1098
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,019
I'm behaving like a fool.

1099
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:02,745
After all I dragged
you into this marriage.

1100
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:04,951
Stop it, don't say that.
It's not true and you know it.

1101
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,073
Leave me alone, will you?

1102
01:04:06,203 --> 01:04:07,074
Listen to me.

1103
01:04:08,287 --> 01:04:09,883
There's something I've got to tell you.

1104
01:04:10,373 --> 01:04:11,244
Please,

1105
01:04:11,656 --> 01:04:12,689
just leave me alone.

1106
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:14,814
Phil... Phil you must listen!

1107
01:04:14,903 --> 01:04:15,774
Harry,

1108
01:04:16,107 --> 01:04:16,978
get out will you?

1109
01:04:18,352 --> 01:04:19,986
- Phil!
- Get out.

1110
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:51,743
I stayed at a hotel that night.

1111
01:04:52,153 --> 01:04:54,229
Made a date to see Phyllis the next day.

1112
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,876
There were things we had to talk about.

1113
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:00,044
She said she'd meet me in
the park near the house.

1114
01:05:01,456 --> 01:05:03,812
It's hard to explain my
thoughts as I sat there.

1115
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:05,737
I had my way out.

1116
01:05:06,228 --> 01:05:07,982
Now I could put an
end to this nightmare.

1117
01:05:09,194 --> 01:05:10,869
I loved Phyllis and our child.

1118
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:12,113
I didn't want to lose them,

1119
01:05:12,843 --> 01:05:14,518
and I hated to bring them pain.

1120
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,226
Hello, Phyllis.

1121
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:28,951
Hi.

1122
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,241
Cigarette?

1123
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:34,525
No, thanks.

1124
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:37,812
How's Danny?

1125
01:05:38,986 --> 01:05:39,857
He's fine.

1126
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,305
I had Miss Higgins come
over and sit with him.

1127
01:05:43,437 --> 01:05:44,308
You look tired.

1128
01:05:45,121 --> 01:05:45,992
Yeah?

1129
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,121
Well I didn't sleep too well last night.

1130
01:05:50,052 --> 01:05:50,923
Neither did I.

1131
01:05:54,423 --> 01:05:56,059
What did you want to talk about Harry?

1132
01:05:57,832 --> 01:05:58,703
I've been thinking.

1133
01:05:59,475 --> 01:06:01,110
I could manage $85 a week.

1134
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:02,634
Can you and Danny make it?

1135
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:03,795
Sure.

1136
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:07,286
You can get the divorce and all
that, and I'll pay for everything.

1137
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:10,934
I'm sorry it had to happen this
way. I never meant to hurt you.

1138
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:16,066
I'll come around later
and get my things.

1139
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:18,473
OK, any time.

1140
01:06:24,095 --> 01:06:25,128
Good bye, Phil.

1141
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,291
Good bye.

1142
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:31,983
Harry!

1143
01:06:35,964 --> 01:06:36,957
This is crazy.

1144
01:06:37,688 --> 01:06:39,242
I can't go through with it.

1145
01:06:40,654 --> 01:06:42,651
I guess you just gave my ego a kick.

1146
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:44,495
Will you forgive me?

1147
01:06:44,704 --> 01:06:46,218
I do love you so

1148
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,983
you big lug.

1149
01:06:49,155 --> 01:06:50,710
You know why I didn't sleep last night?

1150
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:53,356
I kept thinking about our marriage.

1151
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,160
You know, the way we got into it.

1152
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:57,085
I wasn't fair to you.

1153
01:06:57,254 --> 01:06:58,125
Don't say that Phil.

1154
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,531
Never.

1155
01:07:00,222 --> 01:07:01,093
Please,

1156
01:07:01,665 --> 01:07:02,778
take me home will you?

1157
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:06,307
You really want me to?

1158
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:07,548
Yes.

1159
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:09,475
We need you.

1160
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:11,518
Come on.

1161
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:27,830
So you had your out
and couldn't take it.

1162
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:31,399
And yet all the time you
knew it had to end this way.

1163
01:07:32,771 --> 01:07:34,205
And now you're going to call the police.

1164
01:07:35,136 --> 01:07:36,007
Well,

1165
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:37,373
maybe I ought to thank you.

1166
01:07:41,953 --> 01:07:44,751
I'd like a taxi at 132
Brinkman Street please.

1167
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:46,675
That's right, thank you.

1168
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:50,525
I'm not a policeman.

1169
01:07:51,336 --> 01:07:53,733
It's not my duty to do anything

1170
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:57,255
but see that the juvenile wards
of the state of California

1171
01:07:57,295 --> 01:07:58,383
are given decent homes.

1172
01:07:59,596 --> 01:08:01,070
I'll pick up my taxi outside.

1173
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:11,375
I can't figure out my
feelings towards you.

1174
01:08:13,188 --> 01:08:14,141
I despise you

1175
01:08:15,193 --> 01:08:16,067
and I pity you.

1176
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:19,675
I don't even want to shake your hand,

1177
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:23,644
and yet I almost wish you luck.

1178
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,353
Dearest Phyllis,

1179
01:09:26,725 --> 01:09:29,884
just a moment ago I watched
your sweet face as you slept

1180
01:09:30,575 --> 01:09:32,330
knowing I had to hurt you again.

1181
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:35,177
When I tried to say good bye to Danny

1182
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:36,901
it was almost unbearable.

1183
01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:41,392
I cannot expect you to understand
what I'm about to tell you.

1184
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,951
Darling,

1185
01:10:19,324 --> 01:10:21,760
how wonderful you're here!
why didn't you tell me?

1186
01:10:21,849 --> 01:10:24,085
- I couldn't. I have to go away.
- Go away? Where?

1187
01:10:24,256 --> 01:10:25,970
I can't explain now. There isn't time.

1188
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,451
- There's isn't time...
What do you mean?

1189
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:29,057
- I wanted to tell you.
That's why I came back.

1190
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:31,865
There are people waiting
for me downstairs.

1191
01:10:32,114 --> 01:10:33,508
People? What are you saying?

1192
01:10:33,678 --> 01:10:35,874
All I can do is pray that
one day you'll forgive me.

1193
01:10:36,124 --> 01:10:38,440
Try to remember one thing. I love you.

1194
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,803
I've always loved you.

1195
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:42,811
But you can't go away
like this. I love you too!

1196
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,138
Dearest, it's the only way. Tom Morgan
will call you. He knows all about it.

1197
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,029
Harry!

1198
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:34,494
Harry.

1199
01:11:55,716 --> 01:11:56,558
Hello?

1200
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:58,072
- Eve, it's Tom.
- Yes Tom,

1201
01:11:58,883 --> 01:11:59,757
tell me now.

1202
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:06,012
Harry's been married in Los Angeles.

1203
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:50,399
Harry Graham is in no
sense a hero, certainly.

1204
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,844
But neither is he a monster.

1205
01:12:53,134 --> 01:12:54,327
He's an ordinary man

1206
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:57,175
that made one terrible mistake.

1207
01:12:58,347 --> 01:13:01,024
In this case there's a
peculiar sense of irony.

1208
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:03,269
If Harry Graham.

1209
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:06,838
had taken Phyllis Martin as his mistress

1210
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:10,446
some people would have winked
an eye and turned their head.

1211
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:12,782
But because he gave her

1212
01:13:13,112 --> 01:13:16,591
and the child she bore him
his name and an honorable place

1213
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:19,197
In the community he must

1214
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:21,923
be utterly destroyed.

1215
01:13:24,018 --> 01:13:25,212
I don't deny

1216
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,457
that the defendant should be punished,

1217
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:30,665
But I do believe that in this case

1218
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:35,156
punishment might well
be tempered with mercy.

1219
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:37,720
Thank you.

1220
01:13:41,661 --> 01:13:43,856
As the prosecutor has pointed out,

1221
01:13:43,906 --> 01:13:47,265
there are many bigamous marriages
going on that nobody knows about.

1222
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:50,833
The prosecutor is also quite correct

1223
01:13:51,163 --> 01:13:52,888
in observing that this
is a condition

1224
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,963
which strikes at the very
roots of our society.

1225
01:13:55,053 --> 01:13:57,851
Please, stop it. I'm guilty.
Why go on talking about it?

1226
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:00,897
As the counsel for the
defense has brought out,

1227
01:14:01,909 --> 01:14:03,584
there's irony in this case...

1228
01:14:03,914 --> 01:14:05,068
tragic irony.

1229
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:08,997
I suspect that the defendant may
have even loved both these women.

1230
01:14:09,768 --> 01:14:11,523
Perhaps he even needed them both.

1231
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:14,050
I also suspect

1232
01:14:14,941 --> 01:14:17,137
that he may now have lost them both.

1233
01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:22,029
When he's once more a free
man it won't be a question

1234
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:26,920
of which woman he'll go back to, but
rather which woman will take him back.

1235
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:29,005
That decision is theirs.

1236
01:14:30,057 --> 01:14:31,572
Under any circumstances,

1237
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:35,140
he'll be forced to continue
to support them both,

1238
01:14:35,991 --> 01:14:40,473
and he will legalize the status of
his son by naming him in his will.

1239
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,327
These are decent women, Mr. Graham.

1240
01:14:46,777 --> 01:14:49,615
You're basically a decent man.

1241
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:53,304
When a man, even with
the best intentions,

1242
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,471
breaks the moral laws we live by,

1243
01:14:57,763 --> 01:15:00,962
we really don't need man
made laws to punish him.

1244
01:15:01,653 --> 01:15:05,854
He'll find out that the penalty of the
court is always the smallest punishment.

1245
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:12,590
Sentence will be passed for this court
one week from this day, at 11:00 AM.

1246
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,074
The court is adjourned.
