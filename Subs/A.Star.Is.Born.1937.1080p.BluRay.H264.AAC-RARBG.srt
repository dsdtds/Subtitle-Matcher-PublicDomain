A STAR IS BORN
Scene 1

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,166
FADE IN:
MOONLIGHT. LONG SHOT EXPANSE OF SNOW.

16
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:31,166
In the foreground a wolf silhouetted in the moonlight.

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,133
In the background the isolated farmhouse of the Blodgetts.

18
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:37,566
As we hear the melancholy howling of the wolf, we --
DISVOLVE TO:

19
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:44,430
(Howling)

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,900
Well, home from the movies at last.

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,300
Looks like it, Aunt Mattle.

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,966
Hi, Dad!

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,100
Hello, Son!

24
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,500
Well, daughter, how was the movie pictured tonight?

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,300
Hmm.
Lovely.

26
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,300
Right, that's what it was. Just a lot of mud.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,300
There wasn't anybody killed in the whole thing.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,200
No, well then, I'll stick to these, these don't talk.

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,233
Well, that big clock, Norman Maine was in the pictures tonight,

30
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
he never does anything but kiss a lot of girls.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,033
Norman Maine, is one of the best actors in pictures.

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,400
You and your movies.
That's all that you think about.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,500
You shouldn't be allowed to go to them at all, if you ask me.

34
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,200
Too bad I was so busy in the kitchen.

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,400
And I didn't hear anybody asking you.

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,366
Hello, Granny!

37
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,466
Hello, Darling

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,366
And off course no one ever listens to me!

39
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,433
They do if they're within ten miles of ya.

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,033
Gathering around picture shows,

41
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:36,333
house all covered up with movies magazines.

42
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,666
And the other day I caught her talking to a horse with a Swedish accent!

43
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:40,700
Well, Sis...

44
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,500
...you're only young once, you know?

45
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,766
Ah!

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Hollywood!

47
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:52,675
You'd better be getting yourself a good husband and stop mooning about Hollywood.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
You know what she wants to do?

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,500
She wants to go to Hollywood!

50
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,433
I've noted all along.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,866
I've seen her making faces in the mirror and talking to herself

52
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,100
That's what comes of your movies!

53
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,266
Why? What would you do if you did go to Hollywood?

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,800
I'd be an actress.

55
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:11,833
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,000
I would, I tell ya, I've always known I could.

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,733
Guys, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a movie star in the family?
Oh, Miss Blodgett, may I have your autograph?

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,300
You may not know it Aleck, but you're practically on your way to bed.

59
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:27,200
Oh, Miss Blodgett you're my favorite actress, wouldn't you tell me the secret of your success?

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,100
Oh, let me alone!

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,566
Why Esther, what's come over you?

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,200
I'll tell you what's come over her.

63
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,800
She's just a silly little girl whose head is been turned by the movies

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,700
And as soon as she forgets the whole thing, the better off she'll be.

65
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
Oh, why will I be better off?

66
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,000
What's wrong with want to go out and make something of myself? What do you do that's so much better?

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,700
Just because you're satisfied to sit here all your life, you think you can laugh at me!

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,400
Well, some day you won't laugh at me! I'm going out and have a real life! I'm gonna be somebody!

69
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:02,700
Now if it was spring, I'd say give her a good dose of sulfur and molasses.

70
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,366
I thought I'd find you up.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,700
Oh, stop that!

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,100
Now stop crying! that isn't going to do you a bit good.

73
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,333
I'm crying because Aunt Mattie and Aleck make so mad.

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,400
Well, it's your aunt Mattie, Aleck.
They're not important.

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,166
You're the only one that counts.

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,066
Esther, everyone in this world who has ever dreamed about better things

77
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,675
has been laughed at, don't you know that?

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,300
Oh, I suppose I do, but --

79
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,966
But there's a difference between dreaming and doing.

80
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,466
The dreamers just sit around and moon

81
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:39,600
about how wonderful it would be

82
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,733
if only things were different.

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,900
And the years roll on and they grow old

84
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,766
and by and by they forget everything,

85
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:50,000
even about their dreams.

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't want to be like that,
I want to be somebody,

87
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,066
Oh yes, oh yes.

88
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,433
You want to be somebody,

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,900
but you want it to be easy.

90
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,700
Oh, you modern girls give me a pain!

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,866
When I wanted something better,

92
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:06,000
I came across those planes in the prairies... with your Grandfather.

93
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,966
Oh, everyone laughed at us, like they did with the other pioneers.

94
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,800
They said this country will never be anything but a wilderness.

95
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:14,883
We didn't believe that.

96
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
We were going to make a new country.

97
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:18,700
Besides,

98
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,900
we wanted to see our dreams come true.

99
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,866
Oh Granny, it must have been wonderful.

100
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,366
It was wonderful.

101
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:30,666
But don't you think for one single minute that it was easy, Esther Blodgett.

102
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,342
We burned in summer and we froze in winter.

103
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,200
But we kept right on going and we didn't complain.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,566
Because we were doing what we wanted to do!

105
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,833
Can you understand that?

106
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,233
Yes, I can.

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,300
Could you do it?

108
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,900
Could you do it even if it broke your heart?

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,833
Because remember Esther,

110
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,033
for every dream of yours you make come true,

111
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,500
you'll pay the price in heartbreak.

112
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,700
I know what I'm talking about.

113
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,050
You may not believe it,

114
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:08,342
but I was a young girl once.

115
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:10,709
A very pretty young girl,

116
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,400
a lot prettier than you are.

117
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:15,966
I was in love with your grandfather,

118
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,033
and when some indian devil put a bullet through him,

119
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,366
I felt like it had come straight through my heart too.

120
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,766
I remembered all he taught me

121
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,056
and I went right on him.

122
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,733
I buried him out there on that wilderness

123
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,700
with my own hands.

124
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,766
I went right on that same day

125
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,100
And I kept right on the way,

126
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,300
even when your mother was born.

127
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,266
Oh Granny, I would make it worthwhile.

128
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,366
You know, Esther,

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,733
there'll always be a wilderness to conquer.

130
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,933
Maybe Hollywood is your wilderness now.

131
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
From all I hear,

132
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,333
it sounds like it.

133
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,400
But if you've got one drop of my blood in your veins,

134
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:06,566
you won't let Mattie or any of her kind break your heart,

135
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,900
you'll go right out there and break it yourself.

136
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,600
That's your right.

137
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,566
Here.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,633
Oh, here, here, stop that nonsense.

139
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:19,300
Here.

140
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,533
Take this and go to your Hollywood.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,300
Oh, I can't take you money.

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,166
Well, why not?

143
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,200
it's your savings!

144
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,300
Well, I was only saving up for my funeral.

145
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,666
Now I don't think I'm ever going to die.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,366
Oh, granny, how can I ever thank you?

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,700
By giving me your word of honor that you'll never tell a living soul

148
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
where you got that money.

149
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,133
I promise.

150
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,533
Remember,
if you do,

151
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:42,933
I'll have you arrested for robbing me.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
Here we are.

153
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,700
Want me to help you, Granny?

154
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, I can make it, Dear.

155
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:58,300
Oh!

156
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Man, it's cold, uh.

157
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,833
I kissed Dad goodbye,
just a little kiss, he didn't even wake up.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,500
I bet you didn't try that on your Aunt Mattie.

159
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,733
Oh, Aunt Mattie...

160
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,133
Think of her face when you tell her.

161
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,500
I am thinking about it.

162
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,400
I've waited for that chance for thirty years.

163
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,400
Fresh air

164
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,733
Oh, thank you Grelsy.
Girls, eh?

165
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,166
Come on, come on!

166
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,666
Look, there is you train.

167
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,833
All aboard!

168
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,766
Oh, Granny!

169
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:45,033
Come on, come on! go on! go on!

170
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,050
Good bye Granny!

171
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,266
Good bye!

172
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,900
I'll be waiting for you in those movies pictures.

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
And don't tell Mattie,

174
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,500
you know my eyes are not as good as they used to be,

175
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,300
But my ears are alright.

176
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,200
So you remember, talk up good and loud.

177
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,033
All aboard!

178
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,000
Goodbye!

179
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,433
Goodbye!

180
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,300
Goodbye Granny!

181
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,733
Goodbye.

182
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,166
Do you want to go home now?

183
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,666
I don't want to

184
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,066
but I will.

185
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,533
HOLLYWOOD
...the beckoning El Dorado...

186
00:09:35,717 --> 00:09:40,300
Metropolis of Make-Believe in the Californian hills.

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,533
ROOMS FOR RENT
Hollywood

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,433
$6 WEEKLY

189
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,900
Large rooms, running water.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,500
No cowboys.

191
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Convenient to all studios.

192
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:28,933
Good Afternoon.

193
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,042
Day, week or month?

194
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,542
But it's a little hard to say you see,

195
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm going into the movies.

196
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,533
Well you better take it for a week,

197
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,700
it'll break your jump to Beverly Hills.

198
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,800
Are all the studios really near here?

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,866
All except Gramon British.

200
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,875
I suppose the best way to get a job is to go straight to the studios, isn't it?

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,400
I have many illusions you know, I am perfectly willing to begin with...

202
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,666
ooh a little bit of a part,

203
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,933
or even as an extra.

204
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:56,508
$6 please

205
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,300
in advance.

206
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:58,600
Oh.

207
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,450
Miss Esther Blodgett:

208
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,166

00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,000
All extra talent is engaged by this studio,

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,100
as by all other major studios,

211
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,200
through the Central Casting Corporation at.

212
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,566
DO YOU UNDERSTAND FIGURES?

213
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,666

214
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,750

Total 12,146

218
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,933
I beg your pardon,

219
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,758
I'd like to register for extra work.

220
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,900
How long have you been in Hollywood?

221
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,166
Well, it's about a month now.

222
00:12:55,966 --> 00:12:58,400
We haven't put anyone on our books for over two years.

223
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:01,966
Come here,

224
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,508
I'd like to show you something.

225
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,066
- Try later.
- No can't be, try later.

226
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,333
- Try later, thank you.
- Not now, try later.

227
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:22,200
Every time you see one of those little lights flash it's somebody asking for a job.

228
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,433
every time you hear them say: "Try later",

229
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,033
it means there isn't any job.

230
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,133
Can't keep the girls at the switchboard long, they'd go crazy.

231
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:35,400
Every one of those little lights thought it was going to be a star.

232
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,166
Still wanna go in the movies?

233
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:44,633
You know what your chances are?

234
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,342
One in a hundred thousand.

235
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:55,900
Maybe...

236
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,133
...I'm that one.

237
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,333
Any phone calls for me, Mr. Randall?

238
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,900
oh, no.

239
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,833
Jesse L. Lasky and Sammy Goldwyn must be writting letters instead.

240
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,300
How was the luck today?

241
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,508
There wasn't any.

242
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,300
Maybe you don't go at in the right way

243
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,100
Now take Danny McGuire here, he knows the ropes. Don't you Danny?

244
00:14:30,366 --> 00:14:32,233
Sure, I've had 'em around my neck for years.

245
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:37,600
What?

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,700
Oh, Miss Blodgett,

247
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,425
Danny McGuire, our new tenant

248
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,675
How do you do?

249
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,383
Mr. McGuire is a...

250
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,717
...big director.

251
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,967
Oh.

252
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,766
Are you really?

253
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,333
Oh, could you possibly use me in a picture, Mr. McGuire?

254
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,800
Of course I haven't had much experience but

255
00:14:59,033 --> 00:15:01,200
I don't think that really matters if you're willing.

256
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,133
- And I'm --

257
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,000
Now listen, lady.

258
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,000
In the first place I'm not a director, I'm an assistant director

259
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,466
and the second place

260
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,233
if I had any jobs to give away, I'd confirm one of them myself.

261
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,100
and in the third place, you should have stayed back home in the first place!

262
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,066
Oh, no! Look what you've done.

263
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,833
Hey, wait a minute!

264
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:27,033
Hey, don't be that way!

265
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,400
Don't do that.

266
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,433
Gosh, I didn't mean to get tough.

267
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,100
A guy thinks he's being kidded when

268
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:40,133
somebody asking for a job and,

269
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,800
he hasn't got one for himself.

270
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,467
After all, I'm not a big enough shot to

271
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,533
hurt your feelings.

272
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,066
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,758
It wasn't just that, oh, it was a lot of things.

274
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,033
I've been for a job everyday and never getting any nearer to it.

275
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,467
I guess I was beginning to get a little scared.

276
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,166
I know.

277
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,633
Lady, do I know.

278
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,633
Well, There's only one thing to do when you're feeling

279
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,166
tired and sunk and down to your last nickle.

280
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,666
Come on and I'll buy you a drink.

281
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,000
Well its not as bad as down to the last nickle

282
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,633
I've still got $11 left.

283
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,333
$11 dollars!

284
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,233
You're gonna buy me a drink! Come on!

285
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:27,000
That's right George

286
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,733
there's nothing like a little rum to

287
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:30,366
take away that milk flavor.

288
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,166
I beg your pardon.

289
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,300
Certainly.

290
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,100
and when I sign my contract, the first thing
I'm gonna do is see that you direct every picture that I'm in.

291
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,833
Thats my pal!

292
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:59,266
Of course I'm going to be perfectly nice about it, but

293
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll just insist.

294
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,508
Now that's the way to talk.

295
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,592
Don't let 'em lick ya.

296
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,633
They can't lick me,

297
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,200
If they anything like that well,

298
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,900
I just won't sign.

299
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,562
Now that's right.
What have you got to lose?

300
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:21,741
Another one of these and we'll open our own studio.

301
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:29,066
Bill rendered,

302
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,433
twenty four dollars.

303
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,033
Past due.

304
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,700
Remit without further delay.

305
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,666
Me.
<u>(The Management)</u>

306
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,133
Poor kid.

307
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,300
If she can't pay the bills she gets

308
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,900
No.

309
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,566
Fifth race, fifth race, I can't... I can't believe it...

310
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:19,912
HOLLYWOOD BOWL

311
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:34,262
Hey! The program is gonna be swell tonight.

312
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,400
Now you take this fella Beethoven:

313
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,033
I'm a pushover for him.

314
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
And Chopin -

315
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,233
well, he's not so dusty, either.

316
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,633
But I kinda wish that once in awhile that

317
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,266
play something you could sorta go out whistling.

318
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,566
You know, like "Blood on the saddle, blood on..."

319
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,066
well now there's a tune

320
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,133
Hey, why don't you throw your hat in the air or something. Can't you?

321
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,666
but this is a celebration, my job starts tomorrow

322
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,000
I know it does, and I think it's swell, Danny.

323
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,633
Gee, I wish you were in on it too.

324
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:06,700
But oh no, it would have to be a war picture.

325
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:11,075
A big novelty number. The war picture without any beautiful women at the front.

326
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Oh well, something'll happen soon.

327
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:14,100
Maybe.

328
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:17,600
why don't you go home kid?

329
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,433
Oh Danny, I can't do that.

330
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,600
I came here and I've got to stay.

331
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,133
Well now, if it's on account of money I can...

332
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,966
Thank you but you given enough already

333
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,000
Anyhow this is no time to be worrying, this is a party!

334
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,733
Look at all the people.

335
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,000
Everybody in the world,

336
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,166
Look

337
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,800
That's Norman Maine

338
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,733
seems to have had that one extra cocktail

339
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,800
Oh, Thank you.

340
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,600
Sit down you dope that's for the orchestra leader.

341
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
Hello...
 Hello, Norman.

342
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,333
Oh, Mr. Maine, Mr. Maine,

343
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,400
Put your arm around Miss Regis.

344
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,433
Arlow, this is the Hollywood Bowl.

345
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,300
oh, afraid of crowds?

346
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,133
Go ahead, go on, Get outta here!

347
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:32,600
What's the matter? You getting too big to bother with photographers?

348
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:34,833
don't want any pictures taken now.

349
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,333
Oh is that so? Well supposing I take it anyway

350
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,300
I'll shove that Brownie Number 2 of yours down your throat.

351
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,800
Thank you! Mr. Maine!

352
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,100
No! Stop it!

353
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:45,933
No!

354
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,366
Stop it!

355
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,800
No, Stop!

356
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,366
Come on!

357
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,000
Take it easy, Mr. Maine!

358
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,966
Hey, take your hands off.

359
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:54,000
Calm down, please.

360
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,866
Norman! come back and sit down everybody's laughing at you.

361
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,133
Alright, already...

362
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,966
Hi, Norman.

363
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,733
Is he always like that?

364
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,733
Well, I suppose he has to sleep sometime.

365
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,266
Oh and he is so wonderful on the screen.

366
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,800
...and thanks again, dear Granny, for the money -

367
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,033
but you mustn't keep sending it.

368
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,133
Everything is going beautifully now.

369
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,433
In fact, Daniel McGuire, the director,

370
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,600
says I'm certain to get a job very soon.

371
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,400
Come in.

372
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:52,300
Hello, Danny.

373
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,366
What's the matter?

374
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:57,333
Belive it or not, I've got a job for you.

375
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Ah!

376
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,300
Danny, that's wonderful! When do I go to the studio?

377
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,300
Well, you don't exactly know there's a studio.

378
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,533
Oh! It's on location.

379
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,500
No, it's not exactly on location.

380
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:11,100
Of course I haven't any makeup. Will you tell me what to get and sort of help me put it on?

381
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,200
Well, you don't exactly need any makeup,

382
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,733
you see it's not really a picture job

383
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,966
it's, it's well it's being a waitress.

384
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,466
Oh.

385
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:26,025
Well it's kind of a picture job if you look at it right.

386
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,633
but you said it was a waitress.

387
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,833
Well, it's waitressing for Casey Burt.

388
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,133
He's a big director over at our studio, he's giving a party tonight

389
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,933
to kind of celebrate on account of finishing the picture

390
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:40,775
and he wanted me to get him an extra waitress and it's 5 dollars.

391
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,205
and I thought of you right away, Esther.

392
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
That was awfully sweet of you Danny.

393
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,733
Well,

394
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,866
They're gonna be a lot of big people at Burke's house

395
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll bet you there's any number of big directors

396
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:54,300
and if you're there maybe they'll notice you.

397
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,266
I could make them notice me.

398
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,700
Sure you could Ester! It's your chance!

399
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,500
My chance.

400
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,566
Alright Danny I'll do it, oh

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,200
but I can't, I haven't got the right things to wear.

402
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,033
Oh! Oh! Here!

403
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:18,100
You don't think the wardrobe department is right next to my office for nothing, do you?

404
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,775
Haha a perfect fit!

405
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
Did you get to the preview last night?

406
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:38,833
I did.

407
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:45,108
Vould you like a little hors d'oeuvre?

408
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,633
They are very nice.

409
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Well thanks.

410
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,150
What did you think of the picture?

411
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,400
You should have saved it for Thanksgiving.

412
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,133
What a turkey!

413
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,933
Will you have some hors d'oeuvres? You do like hors d'oeuvres don't you?

414
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:08,966
I don't think there's anything so enjoyable as hors d'oeuvres before supper

415
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,500
And these are really delightful.

416
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:25,692
and at the finish, the kid turns around and sings a lullaby to its mother.

417
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
Pardon me, big boy

418
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,166
but, would you like a little, hors d'oeuvres?

419
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,566
They say they're the best.

420
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,400
In town.

421
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:36,366
Don't tell me.

422
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,766
I know.

423
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Mae West.

424
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,066
That's a great twist! But where are you gonna find a two month old baby that can sing?

425
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,033
Hello, Oliver!

426
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:47,900
Oh, hello Casey!

427
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,650
Wanna fire me now or wait till you see the picture?

428
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,766
I'm not a director anymore I'm a...

429
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:53,887
male nurse!

430
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,900
What's the matter with the picture?

431
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,466
A guy by the name of Norman Main

432
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,066
His work is beginning to interfere with his drinking.

433
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:03,400
Oliver,

434
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:06,800
don't tell me I'm to direct his next picture, too. -mhm

435
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,766
You were my favorite producer.

436
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,233
Now wait a minute, you just go right on with your directing.

437
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:14,233
I'll take care of these stars.

438
00:25:14,442 --> 00:25:15,525
I know how to handle them.

439
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,833
I had a serious talk with Norman after that
 Hollywood Bowl occurrence.

440
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
And you not have to worry any more about his behavior.

441
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,466
Excuse me, Mister Niles.

442
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
Mr Libby, of your publicity department is on the telephone.

443
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,333
He says it's most important Sir.

444
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:28,900
It's about Mr. Maine.

445
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:29,866
Thank you.

446
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,900
Oh, it's probably just some little thing.

447
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:36,275
Of course, Oliver!

448
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
I´ll turn on the radio and see

449
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,866
If he's called out the National Guard yet.

450
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,033
Hello Libby, what´s the good word?

451
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,366
Mister Norman Maine, America's prince charming,

452
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,900
Was apprehended driving an ambulance

453
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,333
Down Wilshire Blvd!

454
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:53,775
with a siren going full blast

455
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,442
He explained he was a tree surgeon on a maternity case.

456
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,200
Well... er, will it be in the papers?

457
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,166
No it won't be in the papers.

458
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:04,192
But that's a nice expensive hobby of yours.

459
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,933
Keeping Mr. Maine's informal entertainment out of the public press.

460
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,200
Oh, that´s fine work Libby

461
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,166
Try and see that no one gets to Norman.

462
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,566
He's probably home sleeping it off.

463
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,875
Because you forgot those dopes at the studio for one night

464
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Business, business all the time.

465
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,375
I dont know what´s gonna become of you

466
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:26,600
Norman!

467
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,000
Why didn't you call for me?

468
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:31,466
Oh my darling why didn't I call for you?

469
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,033
In case you've forgotten, I was supposed to come here with you.

470
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:37,366
Oh that old hat's alright, I got here without any trouble.

471
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
The only reason I don't slap your face --

472
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,700
Yes, yes, darling. I- I know.

473
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,250
Hello John!

474
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:44,300
Oh. Hello, Norman!

475
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,400
What's the matter with Oliver?
he looks as if he got bad news.

476
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:48,833
Hello!

477
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:49,433
Hello Larry.

478
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,400
What's the matter, old boy?

479
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:54,200
Maybe I'm wrong.

480
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,733
I guess I've been drinking too much lately.

481
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,666
Oh you ought to cut that down, it's bad stuff

482
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,133
Scotch and soda

483
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:06,445
Come on, come on, come on.

484
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,033
The word you know, is pronounced 'when'.

485
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:11,500
Bad dialog Oliver.

486
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,208
Would rather not watch this

487
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,533
You know best

488
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,375
Soda!

489
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:20,533
Thank you!

490
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:22,233
Uh.

491
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:26,500
Go ahead and say it.

492
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,766
Got it coming to me.

493
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,900
Don't make it tougher on me Norman.

494
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,533
I don't want to stand here and preach,

495
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,566
but take a look at my side of it, I'm trying to make pictures with you

496
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:35,200
I know, I know.

497
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,125
Costs are going up and the grosses are going down.

498
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,033
No, it isn't that.

499
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,533
I made lots of money with you.

500
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,966
And I can afford to take a loss,

501
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,200
but I hate to see you going the way of so many others.

502
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,933
Why don't you get Lloyds to insure you against me?

503
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,800
You can't get insurance against a man forgetting who he is.

504
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:54,500
You're a great star Norman, but there's nobody so big they can afford to have people refuse to work with him.

505
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:56,500
Who doesn't wanna work with me? You--

506
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:57,000
Quiet.

507
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,766
Listen, I know plenty people who do.

508
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,766
Yes and so do I

509
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,700
but your real friends can't stand seeing you start to fall apart.

510
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,000
What do you mean by that?

511
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,966
First signs are always the same

512
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,833
not being able to remember your lines.

513
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,042
Camera man struggling to cover your hangovers

514
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,700
And all because you have to have a good time...

515
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,000
...every day and every night.

516
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,366
Listen I've warned you for a long time.

517
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,800
I know, Oliver you're a swell guy,

518
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,000
you won't lose any money on me.
I'll promise you that.

519
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,000
I'll be ready for the curtains when the time comes.

520
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,100
When it does,

521
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,966
Here's my epitaph.

522
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,100
Good for amusement only.

523
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,667
Now I think I'll um...

524
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,366
have another drink.

525
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,592
Scotch and soda

526
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,300
Scotch and Soda.

527
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:52,750
Come on, come on, come on.

528
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,100
A little soda.

529
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,542
Caviar?

530
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:00,300
No, thanks.

531
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,100
Yes, um pardon me.

532
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,266
Lovely, lovely.

533
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:09,933
I mean caviar.

534
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,042
Oh don't, don't go away, I'm starving.

535
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,500
Which... which would you take?

536
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,292
Oh, I don't know.

537
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,200
You don't know? I... I don 't know either.

538
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:23,917
Hard to choose.

539
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,200
But I think I'll take, caviar.

540
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,466
Mr. Maine doesn't care for anymore.

541
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:30,625
Do you, Norman?

542
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:31,966
No.

543
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,125
No, Normy doesn't care for anymore.

544
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,208
I think I shall get very drunk indeed.

545
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,500
Scotch and soda.

546
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,066
Sorry, I have something.

547
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:07,542
Oh.

548
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,250
Mind if I help you?

549
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,167
Won't they miss you?

550
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:19,333
Oh no no, they'll just look under the table and when they see

551
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,708
I'm not there they'll forget the whole matter.

552
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,866
What... er?

553
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,633
What... what's your name?

554
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,000
Esther Blodgett.

555
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,466
My name is Maine.

556
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:31,300
I know.

557
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,033
You do?

558
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
What, What's so funny?

559
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,033
I was just thinking about all your fans

560
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,133
and how surprised they'd be to see you here helping me put plates away.

561
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,600
Oh they don't know my finest side.

562
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,133
They'd be pretty envious of me

563
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,966
meeting you this way in person.

564
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,266
Oh, how'd you do?

565
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,100
So Tell me eh, eh,

566
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,333
Are you disappointed?

567
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:55,811
Yes.

568
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,875
Oh.

569
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,542
Now you've done it.

570
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:03,042
Oh never mind that, that makes the room look lived in.

571
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,033
Tell me um

572
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,066
wh-

573
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,900
why are you disappointed?

574
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,000
I was sitting behind you,

575
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,800
at the Hollywood Bowl the night you

576
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,333
didn't want to be photographed.

577
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,125
Oh.

578
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,750
I'm told I crept in to many a heart that night

579
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,500
Oh I can never explain this.

580
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,566
You know you have very pretty hair.

581
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,633
You better get out of here.

582
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,133
A sensitive mouth,

583
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,766
and a charming little-

584
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,266
Can't see why you're here instead of with the rest of the guests

585
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,600
I was just trying to be helpful.

586
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,566
I see.

587
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:38,208
Are you sure there's no other attraction?

588
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,858
Well it might be that my old mania for

589
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,200
putting plates away is coming back on me.

590
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,750
It's rather odd. I always know where I can find you.

591
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,333
if there's a pretty girl around.

592
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,033
It's not only odd, it's embarrassing.

593
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,866
You're being deliberately insulting Norman.

594
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,433
I put up with you for long enough-

595
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:53,633
Now dear don't lose your temper.

596
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,166
Remember we must try to keep the voice low.

597
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,500
I know you'll excuse us if we go on with our work.

598
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,566
Now see what you've done!

599
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,000
Come here.

600
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,300
Help me up.

601
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,033
Are you hurt?

602
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,500
No more than usual.

603
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,900
Come on! The wolves are on us we gotta get outta here.

604
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:34,700
I can't! The dishes aren't finished!

605
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,417
Oh yes they are!

606
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,166
Well,

607
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,266
I bet I know what you're gonna say now.

608
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,033
What?

609
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:54,633
Good night.

610
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:56,917
Good night and thanks.

611
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,866
Hey wait a minute. Wait a minute.

612
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:00,625
Hey, Uh...

613
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,900
Here.

614
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:03,433
You realize that

615
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,266
all I found out about you is that you're

616
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,433
foolish enough to want to go into pictures?

617
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,417
Why the foolish, look at you.

618
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,500
Oh, that's what I mean.

619
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,400
No I'd

620
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,750
I'd rather like to go into this matter a little more thoroughly.

621
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,166
Well that's awfully nice of you.

622
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:22,866
Why um

623
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:26,366
why don't we uh go on up to my place and

624
00:33:27,066 --> 00:33:28,200
talk it over?

625
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,600
Oh, no.
Thank you very much, but

626
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,366
I really must say goodnight.

627
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,833
Goodnight.

628
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:37,633
You're not angry.

629
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:38,800
No no no.

630
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,583
I'm hungry.

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,600
Well, why don't you go and get something to eat?

632
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,533
Goodnight, Miss Blodgett.

633
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,100
Goodnight, Mr. Maine.

634
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:52,233
Wait a minute.

635
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,800
Least I can do is to see you to your door.

636
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:00,966
Will I see you again?

637
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,208
I hope so.

638
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,917
Has anyone ever told you that you're lovely?

639
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:09,792
Well, now you know.

640
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,200
Thank you.

641
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:17,917
It's a...

642
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,042
It's hard to say, but I

643
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:22,900
I wanna say it anyway.

644
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,866
You know I'm a, I'm a screen, I'm a

645
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,625
you know

646
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,166
In private life, I'm a

647
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:33,400
You know...

648
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,200
but whatever I do I

649
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,833
still respect lovely things.

650
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,900
And you're lovely.

651
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,633
Do you understand?

652
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,568
Yes, I think I do.

653
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:52,000
and it isn't that bump on the head that's doing this

654
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,366
I'm glad.

655
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:00,733
Goodnight.

656
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,366
Goodnight.

657
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,000
Hey!

658
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,042
Do you mind if I take just one more look?

659
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:21,917
Go away!

660
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,292
Quite impossible.

661
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,292
I wouldn't even consider it!

662
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,633
Oh no no!

663
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:38,400
Hello?

664
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,083
Who is it?

665
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,300
Who?

666
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,500
Norman?!

667
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:44,900
What have you done now?

668
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,933
You're not in jail are you?

669
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,566
Ohh.

670
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,600
Yes, I see.

671
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:55,200
Oh it's that again.

672
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,300
I see.

673
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,458
She's beautiful.

674
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,542
I know, you want me to give her a screen test.

675
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,266
Yeah?

676
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,800
Certainly, she's got wonderful possibilities.

677
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,966
Oh, you know she's got something.

678
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,866
and you knew all the other ones had something too

679
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,900
Oh no.

680
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,733
I tell you Oliver,

681
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,466
She's got that sincerity and and honestness.

682
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,833
and uh, uh

683
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:23,666
uh sincerity and honestness that uh that makes

684
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,266
great actresses

685
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:29,700
Oliver, I am so sure of this girl,

686
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,233
that I want to take the test with her myself.

687
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,133
hmm...

688
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,900
Listen Oliver, you've worked hard,

689
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,700
you're entitled to a break.

690
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:39,600
You get...

691
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes. I heard you.

692
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,300
Anything. ANYTHING.

693
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:50,266
Yes!

694
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,633
Yes. Yeah.

695
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:54,000
Oliver, look,

696
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,083
You, you try to get a little sleep now old man.

697
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,400
right, alright boy.

698
00:36:59,733 --> 00:37:00,533
Go- Good Night.

699
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,866
*mumbles*

700
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Telephone book

701
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,458
Telephone book.

702
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,333
Where's telephone bo..

703
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,733

Telephone!

708
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,266
For me?

709
00:38:57,933 --> 00:39:01,033
Some drunk trying to be funny, says he's Norman Maine.

710
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,566
Oh, oh thanks I'll be right down.

711
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,292
And Miss Blodgett.

712
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:10,600
Would you give him the message for me?

713
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,917
Tell him it's 3 o'clock in the morning!

714
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:38,200
Hello?

715
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,900
What?

716
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,000
Ohh.

717
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,716
Ohh!

718
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,458
Oh..

719
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,633
Oh yes yes I'll be there!

720
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:51,900
Oh thank you!

721
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:52,966
Sigh

722
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,366
Danny...Danny...

723
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:04,633
Danny, what do you think? I'm going to take a test tomorrow and Norman Maine's helping me do it!

724
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,333
I'm taking one too.

725
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:10,366
Garbo's assisting me.

726
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,033

735
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,900
Put a double on that 90

736
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,500
bring it down a little.

737
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:50,600

QUIET!

752
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,333
Quiet!

753
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:44,300
Quiet!

754
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,766
quiet...quiet...

755
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:46,433
Quiet!

756
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:47,766
quiet...

757
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,125
Ready Norman.

758
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,100
Yup.

759
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:53,533
Ready Miss uh, what's your name.

760
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,233
He'll soon know your name, Esther.

761
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,000
The whole world's going to know it.

762
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,800
But I'm so scared.

763
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
Maybe I'd better not try today.

764
00:42:02,233 --> 00:42:05,100
Oh, come on, now don't be foolish. They all had to go through this.

765
00:42:05,568 --> 00:42:07,704
Harlow, Lombard, Myrna Loy.

766
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:08,766
And now,

767
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,333
Esther Blodgett.

768
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:12,700
Alright.

769
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:13,792
I'm ready.

770
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,700
This is a take.

771
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,666
Roll 'em.

772
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,800
Quiet!

773
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,000
Take

774
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,633
Oliver Niles Productions.

775
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:24,266
By Oliver Niles (Producer)

776
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,333
Esther Victoria Blodgett (Artist)

777
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
I may as well tell you that my whole organization

778
00:42:28,566 --> 00:42:29,833
thinks I've gone a little nuts

779
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:30,633
to sign you.

780
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,625
Maybe they are right, I've been nuts before.

781
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:34,833
You see,

782
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,933
All the experts seems to think that your type is a little mild for present day's taste.

783
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:42,033
I'd rather believe that tastes change, like eyebrows.

784
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:45,266
And I think that also like eyebrows, tastes are going back to the natural.

785
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,100
You look like a nice girl,

786
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,625
I think I'm going to like you.

787
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,766
That's not important.

788
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,466
I think the public will like you.

789
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,300
That is important.

790
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,166
Oh yes.

791
00:42:58,433 --> 00:43:00,366
I see what you mean, I - I mean I know it is.

792
00:43:00,633 --> 00:43:01,866
but you don't think it's going to be easy

793
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,792
Nothing you really want is ever given away free.

794
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:06,100
You have to pay for it.

795
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,300
and usually with your heart.

796
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,866
Someone else told me that once.

797
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,400
But you still have to work it out for yourself.

798
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,833
Oh well, all this is just a long way of saying

799
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,666
I'm glad you're with us, and good luck to you.

800
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,708
Now, I'm going to turn you over to our demon press agent, Libby.

801
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,266
Don't let him frighten you.

802
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,600
He has a heart of gold...

803
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,600
only harder.

804
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:29,792
And for the love of Pete,

805
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,900
learn to close your mouth and keep it closed.

806
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:33,583
Even in your love scenes.

807
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:47,700
Are you a Russian?

808
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,666
No, I was born in Filmore North Dakota.

809
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:51,700
Oh no.

810
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:54,833
Grace saw light of day...

811
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,666
In a mountain cabin,

812
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,167
at trappers hut

813
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,433
High up in the rockies

814
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:02,504
Go on.

815
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,500
Well, I always wanted to be an actress.

816
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:07,766
Dreamed of footlights,

817
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,750
as lonely kitty

818
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,900
Are you sure theres no Russian in your family?

819
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,733
Positive.

820
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,033
That's a shame.

821
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,833
Well, what does your father do?

822
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:18,000
He's a farmer.

823
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,083
Eh..

824
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,250
Social registeried Father

825
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,266
Fed up with hypocrisy

826
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
a 400...

827
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,800
sought wilderness for consolation.

828
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,750
There amidst the mountain flowers.

829
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,533
He raised another blossom.

830
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,700
His lovely little daughter.

831
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:36,033
What's your name?

832
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:39,366
Esther Victoria Blodgett.

833
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,700
Greatly appreciating your attention in this matter, very surely...

834
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,400
do you know what her name is?

835
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:54,233
Esther Victoria Blodgett.

836
00:44:55,866 --> 00:44:57,800
He will have to do something about that right away

837
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,083
Esther Victoria Blodgett

838
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,966
Well, that Blodgett's definitely out.

839
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,300
Let's see, Esther Victoria

840
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,000

841
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,766

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,933
Oh, that's very pretty.

847

Hesta, hesta, Jesta, Lester, Vicky Lester!

Say it!

850
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,566

851
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,266
Say it again.

852
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,900
Vicki Lester

853
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:33,875
Say it again.

854
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:34,965
Vicki Lester

855
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,533
Say it!

856
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,500

Vicki Lester

860
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,600
Vicki Lester

861
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,566
Vicki Lester!

862
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,466
Lester.

863
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,466
Franz

864
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,100
Oliver Nile Studio discovers new starlet.

865
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,633
A Cinderella of the Rockies

866
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:51,966
Her name is Vicky Lester

867
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,200
Those who have peeked

868
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,500
tells me should couldn't be more divine

869
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,300
The face of an angel and such natural talent

870
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,066
Her voice is a symphony.

871
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,066
Her very walk, they tell me is enough to drive men mad!

872
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,375
Not that way!

873
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:10,917
Get the lead outta your feet! Lift them up!

874
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:20,417
That's better.

875
00:46:20,733 --> 00:46:22,100
It's terrible, but it's better.

876
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,792
The quality of mercy is not strange

877
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,400
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

878
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,066
Cease.

879
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Through the mouth, my child. Through the mouth.

880
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,700
The nose is for smelling roses.

881
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,366
Proceed.

882
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,800
Does she have to look surprised all the time?

883
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,591
Anyway, it's just a rough sketch.

884
00:46:52,292 --> 00:46:53,667
pretty small mouth eh?

885
00:46:58,266 --> 00:46:59,300
Oh well,

886
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,533
Give her that cloth a squeeze

887
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:02,300
ooh

888
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,625
This will give that xjssalhhfid

889
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:21,417
We are on the wrong track,

890
00:47:22,066 --> 00:47:23,600
she still looks surprised.

891
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:29,542
Listen drunk people

892
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,200
My shoes not on the step this morning

893
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:32,500
not in the camera

894
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:33,900
now come on snap in to it!

895
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:40,075
Acme trrrrucking company.

896
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,633
No, Mister Smith is not in!

897
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,875
Acme trucking company.

898
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,333
No.

899
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:56,458
Mister Smith is not in.

900
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,233
Good morning, what can I bring you Mr. Maine?

901
00:48:07,433 --> 00:48:09,300
Just shows how long you've been here.

902
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,533
Never blushes.

903
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:13,400
How soon are you and I going to be married huh?

904
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:14,666
I don't know.

905
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:16,667
You will have to ask my mother.

906
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,300
Acme trucking company.

907
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:31,958
No, Mister Smith is not in.

908
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,000
Acme trucking company.

909
00:48:37,433 --> 00:48:40,700
No, Mister Smith is not in.

910
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,233
Acme...

911
00:48:45,566 --> 00:48:47,266
Naw Shmith ain't in!

912
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,400
Acme trucking company.

913
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,300
I'd like to speak to Mr. Smith please.

914
00:49:01,466 --> 00:49:02,700
Mister Smith is not--

915
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,633
Oh, Norman!

916
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,200
What's all this between you and Smith?

917
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:08,166
I got a part... It's only one line...

918
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,266
but it's in the Picture!

919
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:12,233
So it's ambition that made you break that date with me last night.

920
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,400
I had to be here so early this morning.

921
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:15,500
Uh, so did I.

922
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,066
I had to stay up all night to make it.

923
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,733
You've started your picture, haven't you?

924
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,400
No, no we are still in the testing stage.

925
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,766
Can't seem to get the right girl for the lead.

926
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:29,667
Hmm..You'd think with all the girls there are...

927
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,600
Yeah, well this one's got to be different.

928
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,566
She's got to be little, and cute, and sweet,

929
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:36,208
And intelligent.

930
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,566
Well blow me down.

931
00:49:39,666 --> 00:49:40,033
What?

932
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,458
Well close my tired old eyes,

933
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,333
Wha..what is it?

934
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:44,500
Hold everything, come on.

935
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,266
Come on!

936
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,700
Have you been through the whole casting, Director?

937
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:53,666
I'll work day and night Mr...

938
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:54,933
And I'll work with her Oliver!

939
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,566
I can mean or nasty or anything you want, Mr Niles.

940
00:49:57,833 --> 00:49:59,833
If she clicks Oliver, you've got a star overnight.

941
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:03,100
Ok.

942
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,100
You are about to see the Preview of a picture

943
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,400
that has not been finally edited.

944
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,700
Your opinion will be appreciated.

945
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,933
Please mail comment cards.

946
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,000
Oliver Niles

947
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,866
presents

948
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:26,900
NORMAN MAINE

949
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:27,600
in

950
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,966
"THE ENCHANTED HOUR"

951
00:50:30,566 --> 00:50:31,333
introducing

952
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,733
VICKI LESTER

953
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:43,033
Wait till you hear them at the end of the picture.

954
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:58,400
When the world tripped politely

955
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,600
to the genteel music of spinnets.

956
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:13,683
Do you think we were noticed?

957
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:16,653
No one... They're much to busy playing at croquet.

958
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:21,200
I have loved you all my life.

959
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:23,833
But we have only met two days ago.

960
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:27,166
That's when my life began.

961
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:47,166
PREVIEW TONITE

962
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:51,900
Ain't she cute?

963
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,600
You know I think she's the same type I am. Don't you? I think she's sweet.

964
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,066
Well...has this picture...

965
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:56,966
all right!

966
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,600
I think she was much better than he was.

967
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,542
These producers are so horribly down...

968
00:52:00,866 --> 00:52:01,666
They wont know how good she is...

969
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,833
Well maybe it's because she's a good girl.

970
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,233
All I mean is that it's not so bad..but it's even less that I want to see.

971
00:52:09,366 --> 00:52:11,600
Darling, I think she's the most precious little thing I've ever-

972
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,866
She's a knock out Libby.

973
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,300
You might mention that when you write your review.

974
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,766
Unless the kids' a gold mine.

975
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,366
Did you like Norman Maine?

976
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,233
Was he in it?

977
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:24,300
Libby?

978
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,933
I'm afraid we have another hit.

979
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:27,133
It's in the bag.

980
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,900
Deeply tied up with beautiful pink ribbons.

981
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,300
Hey, where are Norman and Vicky?

982
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,666
I don't know, I thought you had them.

983
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:35,000
I wish they'd come, were having a party at the Trocadero.

984
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,133
Isn't it thrilling running away from people?

985
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,700
Norman, it's so exciting! So-

986
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,733
- So-
- So new.

987
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:44,875
A star is born.

988
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,583
Come on!

989
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:56,875
Wonderful, isn't it?

990
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,542
A crazy quilt.

991
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,233
Well...It's a carpet spread for you...

992
00:53:05,268 --> 00:53:07,000
All yours from now on you know.

993
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,500
you're a success

994
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:13,800
You can have everything in the world you want.

995
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,333
Hope it'll make you happy.

996
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:19,833
Doesn't it you?

997
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:24,917
Well... That was one thing I never had...

998
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:27,095
Lots of times I..

999
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,166
I told myself I'd find it but I always knew I was lying.

1000
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,933
Still I...I never stopped looking for it...

1001
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,266
Maybe it'll come.

1002
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,042
Well I think it has come Ester.

1003
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,200
I only wish it weren't too late.

1004
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,125
Oh but it's not too late.

1005
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,900
Oh you can't throw away your life the way I've thrown away mine.

1006
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,566
I don't have anything left that's good enough...now.

1007
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:55,966
You can't...

1008
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:58,625
Norman.. You can...

1009
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:02,042
You mustn't tell me that, Esther.

1010
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,333
So afraid that I'll believe it.

1011
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,466
Pick your right!

1012
00:54:28,133 --> 00:54:29,333
Swell, isn't it?

1013
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,000
Lovely.

1014
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,400
Let's watch again.

1015
00:54:32,066 --> 00:54:34,333
He got ya...shoot your right!

1016
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,200
Go!...He got him!

1017
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,300
he did, didn't he?

1018
00:54:43,466 --> 00:54:44,900
Yeah, but he'll be up, though.

1019
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,733
You like it?

1020
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:46,300
Sure I do.

1021
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,033
You like me?

1022
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,866
Sure I do.

1023
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,533
That reminds me. Will you marry me?

1024
00:54:51,566 --> 00:54:52,533
No thank you.

1025
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,400
Come on...finish him! Why won't you marry me?

1026
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Because you're not dependable

1027
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,400
Shoot your right!

1028
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:58,433
you throw away your money.

1029
00:54:58,533 --> 00:54:58,900
Break him off!

1030
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,366
and you drink so much.

1031
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,233
cause i quit drinking

1032
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,000
Yes?

1033
00:55:05,066 --> 00:55:07,266
Come on...Shoot your right in there... the right!!

1034
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,533
Cause I save my money.

1035
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,000
Yes.

1036
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,800
There he goes!...Let him have it!!

1037
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,433
I'm absolutely dependable on all occasions... Yes...

1038
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,900
Yeah!

1039
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:25,466
He got ya... He got him...He got him!

1040
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,333
He certainly did.

1041
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,200
Yeah that was a beautiful fight!

1042
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:40,066
Norman?

1043
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:40,793
Yes dear?

1044
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,166
Would you do all that for me if I said I'd marry you?

1045
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:46,266
No..certainly not...I'd just support you.

1046
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,466
We're going to be married.

1047
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,233
Guess I didn't read that line right.

1048
00:55:56,492 --> 00:55:57,367
I'll try it again.

1049
00:55:58,247 --> 00:56:00,242
We are going to be married.

1050
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:01,066
Both of us.

1051
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:02,166
To each other.

1052
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:03,533
What do you think of that?

1053
00:56:04,033 --> 00:56:05,266
Well when? Where?

1054
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,366
Oh, we thought that we'd elope

1055
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:08,700
In a conventional manner.

1056
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,450
What's the matter?

1057
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,266
Trying to decide whether it's good for the studio.

1058
00:56:15,492 --> 00:56:15,950
Is it?

1059
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:17,466
It is.

1060
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,166
Bless you my children.

1061
00:56:19,533 --> 00:56:20,333
When's it going to happen?

1062
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:21,933
Oh we thought we'd just sneak out some time.

1063
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:23,466
W're not telling anyone but you.

1064
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:25,366
Listen to this!

1065
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:27,100
The squeeze ideal romance

1066
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,000
blossomed into breathing reality

1067
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:30,833
Today when Vicky Lester and Norman Maine,

1068
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:32,666
America's dream lovers

1069
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:35,733
Slipped quietly thru the portals of holy matrimony.

1070
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:36,866
How does it sound?

1071
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:38,233
Horrible.

1072
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:40,100
But you see we're going to elope.

1073
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:40,966
Sure you are!

1074
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,266
It will be the biggest elopement this town ever saw.

1075
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,800
We'll get a tie-up with the army

1076
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,833
and have you escorted all the way down to Yuma

1077
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:48,866
by twenty of their new bombing planes.

1078
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:50,700
Is he going with us?

1079
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,200
Don't you think we can work this thing out better alone?

1080
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,900
No sense in bothering the happy couple with all the details.

1081
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,066
I'll see to it that you get a carbon copy of the whole layout.

1082
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:01,000
I can hardly wait.

1083
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:04,433
I'm sorry we didn't realize we were in the way.

1084
00:57:04,933 --> 00:57:08,700
While you're settling the details, you don't mind if I take this woman out and buy her a ring, do you?

1085
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:10,992
Sure, go ahead, we want everything legal.

1086
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:14,500
That's a charming match.

1087
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:16,566
A nice girl like Vicky.

1088
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,666
and public nuisance number one.

1089
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:19,466
Now wait a minute,

1090
00:57:19,633 --> 00:57:20,366
Norman's alright.

1091
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,833
And if you'll pardon my pointing, Vickie's business is her own.

1092
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,100
It doesn't require any comment.

1093
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:25,566
I wasn't making any comments.

1094
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:27,433
I just said it's a rotting shame.

1095
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:28,533
So go ahead and plan the elopement.

1096
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,233
Oh that elopement stuff is out.

1097
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,200
You can't get any scope in that.

1098
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,833
We are going to have a wedding.

1099
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:35,866
Where will we have it?

1100
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:37,833
Customary place I believe is a church.

1101
00:57:37,966 --> 00:57:38,466
Nah.

1102
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,433
Been done.

1103
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,900
This gotta be something big.

1104
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,166
The beach.

1105
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,500
I can visualize it.

1106
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,533
The bridesmaids in bathing suits.

1107
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,833
Twenty thousand Santa Monica school children.

1108
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,600
filling out the word love.

1109
00:57:56,408 --> 00:57:57,867
It's a novelty, but is it big enough?

1110
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,198
Why not the city hall?

1111
00:58:00,766 --> 00:58:01,800
A police escort.

1112
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:03,933
Every motorcycle cop in town.

1113
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,866
Sirens screaming. Confetti pouring out of buildings.

1114
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,933
Like the Lindbergh reception in New York.

1115
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,533
Only on a big scale.

1116
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,233
What's the matter? Isn't it big enough?

1117
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,633
And now if any man can show just cause

1118
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,266
why these two may not be lawfully joined together

1119
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,672
let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.

1120
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:26,033
Do you

1121
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,200
Alfred Henkle

1122
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,533
take this woman as your lawful wedded wife?

1123
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,400
Will you love, comfort, honor and keep her in sickness and in health?

1124
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:34,166
as long as you both shall live?

1125
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,233
I will. Do you

1126
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:36,266
I beg your pardon.

1127
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,300
Do you Esther Blodget take

1128
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:40,408
this man as you your lawful wedded husband?

1129
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:43,500
Will you obey, serve, love, honor and keep him in sickness and in health?

1130
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,933
as long as you both shall live?

1131
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,400
I will.

1132
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,733
Place the ring on her finger.

1133
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,300
And hurry please.

1134
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,433
Now by virtues of the power invested in me

1135
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,666
as justice of the peace of

1136
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,233
I pronounce you man and wife.

1137
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:09,367
Quiet!

1138
00:59:13,434 --> 00:59:16,617
And now I must exercise my prerogative of office.

1139
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:21,117
I hope you'll be very happy Mrs. Hinkle.

1140
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:21,966
Thank you.

1141
00:59:22,908 --> 00:59:23,700
Thank you, sir.

1142
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,733
Thank you very much.

1143
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,300
Now if you will please sign the license.

1144
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:28,533
Oh, oh yeah.

1145
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,700
You know ahh.. Mrs. Hinkle...

1146
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,933
I can't help but believe I've seen you somewhere before.

1147
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,166
Oh really?

1148
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,233
Oh well, uh, I believe this is the first time I've ever been in San Bardo.

1149
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,800
You know your face is familiar too. Really? Here you are.

1150
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,833
Thank you very much.

1151
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,700
Well thank you.

1152
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:44,766
thank you

1153
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,766
Good bye.

1154
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:46,600
Good bye.

1155
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:47,933
Norm!

1156
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,566
Nice to see you again...

1157
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,233
No I just...coming darling.

1158
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,000
Ya I think he got by with it.

1159
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,966
but it was closed

1160
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,333
J.P. was just beginning to remember where he'd seen it.

1161
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:57,966
anyway we got away from Libby

1162
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,033
Hello, Sir!

1163
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:06,500
If you would be kind enough to glance between my shoulder blades.

1164
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:08,533
Mr. and Mrs. Hankle.

1165
01:00:08,733 --> 01:00:10,300
You will find there a knife.

1166
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,266
Buried to the hilt.

1167
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,333
On the handle are your initials.

1168
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,833
Really good seeing you Libby!

1169
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:16,233
Hold it Danny!

1170
01:00:26,742 --> 01:00:29,367
There comes a couple of rats I raised from mice.

1171
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:31,492
Well, they've got a right to get married haven't they?

1172
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,867
You haven't got any right to double cross the public.

1173
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:35,450
i haven't done it yet

1174
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:37,200
Hey!

1175
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:40,075
People vs. Porky Washington.

1176
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Who is charge with violating section 600...

1177
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,933
Now your in contempt of court!

1178
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:44,866
Operator?

1179
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:46,666
Los Angeles Tribune

1180
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,433
I have a good mind to put you under arrest!

1181
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:49,900

1182
01:00:50,658 --> 01:00:51,422

1183

Tribune!

1184
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,200
Give me the city desk.

1185
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:55,433
Johnny!

1186
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,700
This is Matt Libby

1187
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,966
I've got a flash for you.

1188
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,800
Norman Maine and Vicki Lester

1189
01:00:59,866 --> 01:01:02,066
were married at 2:30 this afternoon.

1190
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:03,133
Vicki Lester?!

1191
01:01:03,533 --> 01:01:04,833
Court recess!

1192
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:15,933
VICKI LOVES IN TRAILER!

1193
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,900
So give me a horse...a great big horse...

1194
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:55,800
A great big buckeroo and

1198
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:32,133
Waohoo.

1199
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:35,566
i don't want to sound immodest

1200
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,466
but i think I've stripped a gear

1201
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,900
Well sit down won't you and let's get acquainted.

1202
01:02:40,033 --> 01:02:42,366
Probably be seeing quite a bit of each other from now on.

1203
01:02:42,366 --> 01:02:45,666
might just as well break the ice now as later

1204
01:02:52,383 --> 01:02:53,633
now we're old friends

1205
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,766
hey, have i got time for a shower before dinner?

1206
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,166
plenty, if you can find a shower

1207
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:03,033
i never can remember where that thing is

1208
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,500
it pull out or slide under?

1209
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,900

1210
01:03:06,066 --> 01:03:07,933
nope, that's the linen closet

1211
01:03:08,467 --> 01:03:09,092

1212
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:10,633
Nice work.

1213
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:13,000
half the time those things are just luck

1214
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,733

1215
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,233
Hey Esther.
 Uh, there's no soap.

1216
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,900
Here.

1217
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,066
Oh and Esther!

1218
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:35,533

How you fix the cigarettes?

1221
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,466
You know I never smoke underwater.

1222
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,600
What do I do to make this thing work?

1223
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,300
Pull that gadget at the top and pray for rain.

1224
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:55,200
Oh I...

1225
01:03:56,092 --> 01:03:58,675

01:03:59,533 --> 01:04:02,033
You go in there with your arms down you'll never get your bath.

1227
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:03,600

1228
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,733

1229
01:04:07,966 --> 01:04:09,366

Quick what?

1238
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,266
Quick go out and stop them and ask for help.

1239
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,666
I'll catch a cold!

1240
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,133
Get warm again.

1241
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,100
they'll recognize me

1242
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,300

1243
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,100

1244
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:47,633

Yeah, how'd you guess it?

Can you get us some help?

1250
01:04:58,433 --> 01:04:59,666
Well, I reckon not.

1251
01:04:59,866 --> 01:05:01,233
You know it's a long way to town,

1252
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,266
We're pretty busy down at that place.

1253
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,566
Well, I got to get out of here I got my wife with me.

1254
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:06,266
She like the country?

1255
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:06,900
No.

1256
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,500
And we're short of food.

1257
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,866
there's a lot of game in them woods

1258
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,200

1259
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,466
Well your sure up against it.

01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,566
Sorry I can't do anything

1261
01:05:14,733 --> 01:05:16,800

 Wait listen I'll be frank with you.

1262
01:05:17,233 --> 01:05:18,133

1263
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:18,866
Who?

1264
01:05:19,717 --> 01:05:20,467
Norman Maine!

1265
01:05:20,866 --> 01:05:22,000
my name is Jett Baker

1266
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,066
Glad to have met you.

1267
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,100
Well so long.

1268
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,966
hey wait a..wait a minute..listen..you don't

1269
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,633
So you are Norman Maine.

1270
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:38,800
CINEMA SIDELIGHTS

1271
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:39,900
-- BY ARTIE CARVER --

1272
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,466
What famous male star has stopped gargling the grog

1273
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,066
and is now taking a non-alcoholic honeymoon?

1274
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,266
But why do friends think

1275
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,200
his bride came about six performances too late

1276
01:05:46,266 --> 01:05:47,900
as far as the public is concerned?

1277
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:51,166
I've got my prestige to look out for.

1278
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,666
i'm supposed to be the best publicity man in the racket

1279
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,833
And they laughed themselves sick when I even

1280
01:05:55,933 --> 01:05:57,533
try to get a decent mention of me.

1281
01:05:57,933 --> 01:06:00,700
yes, i know how sensitive you are Libby. I don't like to see your feelings hurt

1282
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:01,700
Thanks boss.

1283
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:02,733
Now Vicki,

1284
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,600
there's a dish for free space

1285
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
but if Maine swam across the Pacifi

1286
01:06:07,066 --> 01:06:08,600
the papers would keep it a secret

1287
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:09,666
Well,

1288
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,600
the exhibitors don't like him,

1289
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,166
the critics don't like him,

1290
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,433
the public don't like him,

1291
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:16,833
and I don't like him.

1292
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,300
Who likes him?

1293
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:29,175
Oh but darling, this is almost too much.

1294
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:32,098
there i was in my touching innocence

1295
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:33,666
thinking we were going to live in the beach house

1296
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,366
oh, we'll still keep a place at malibu

1297
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,633
this is special, this is our castle. It used to be in the air

1298
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,366
we will never use any ugly words like,

1299
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:42,633
contracts and pictures and careers

1300
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,766
When we come in those gates,

1301
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:47,000
Check the studio outside.

1302
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:48,967
Come on I got another little surprise for you.

1303
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:08,366
Oh Norman it's lovely.

1304
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,366
so are you, lovely

1305
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,066
The whole world is lovely.

1306
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,175
Hey! Hold it!

1307
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,200
That's it.

1308
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:26,700
Caption!

1309
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,733
Their honeymoon never ends.

1310
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,100
Alright, let's get some pictures.

1311
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,200
Now the bride will sit here.

1312
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,900
And the groom stand behind her.

1313
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:36,500
You have something unique.

1314
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,566
now lets go after something different

1315
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,866
You sit down and she'll stand up.

1316
01:07:44,925 --> 01:07:45,925
pretty radical isn't it?

1317
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:47,700
Yea, but in a nice way

1318
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,900
Ok Otto fire!

1319
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,000
caption. Their honeymoon begins a new.

1320
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,300
Wow, the producer.

1321
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:00,933
Caption. Their honeymoon ceases abruptly.

1322
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:01,900
Hello Oliver

1323
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:03,433
Oh I'm glad your back.

1324
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,833
Vicki, how well you're lookng.

1325
01:08:05,066 --> 01:08:05,966
Hello Oliver.

1326
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,200
Am I interrupting?

1327
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,333
Yes, thank you.

1328
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:09,400
just want a couple more pictures

1329
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,600
that's enough of both of them

1330
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,000
what they're asking for are exclusives of Miss Lester

1331
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:13,933
alone!

1332
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,200
oh i see

1333
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,633
come on Oliver, let you and me get exclusive

1334
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:18,500
see you later Vicky

1335
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:22,433
don't worry, my camera smashing days are over

1336
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,800
danger only days are over

1337
01:08:25,466 --> 01:08:26,500
hold that Miss Lester

1338
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,233
gorgeous!

1339
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,600
Oliver!

1340
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,200
how's the dividend situation?

1341
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,300
very pleasant, i think we sold two million on our next quarter

1342
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,240
smart move of mine to sell my stock eh?

1343
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,500
oh well, when you need money you need it

1344
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,400
some people save up for just such an event

1345
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,360
there's bound to be a rainy day occasionally

1346
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:48,520
Well as a citizen of California, I've always refused to admit that

1347
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,350
I know, but still it does rain

1348
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,440
well anyways, you can thank me for some of those dividends of yours

1349
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,700
can't you?

1350
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,780
that was a little too quick Oliver

1351
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,100
Well then...Chanadora was a smash hit wasn't he?

1352
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,900
They made Vicky a star overnight

1353
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,600
how about me?

1354
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,290
well lets talk about business at the office Norman

1355
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,900
beautiful pool you have here

1356
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:14,470
no, lets talk about it here

1357
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,200
do they like me?

1358
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:20,110
maybe the part wasn't just right

1359
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,990
look, Oliver

1360
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,720
you think I'm slipping?

1361
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:27,070
can you take it?

1362
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,100
the tense is wrong. You're not slipping, you've slipped.

1363
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,600
My fan mail is still big.

1364
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,610
Norman, Norman, fan will write to anybody with a photograph.

1365
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,400
It only costs 3 cents for a stamp, and that makes photographs cheaper than wallpaper

1366
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,200
But every 25 cents they pay for a theater ticket buys them the right to be a critic.

1367
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,450
and your last few performances Norman, have not pleased your critics

1368
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,000
you remember i told you I'd uh...

1369
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,200
be ready for the curtains when the time came?

1370
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,300
well here it is.

1371
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,330
let's call off the contract, no hard feelings

1372
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:11,080
we're not quitting. Either of us

1373
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,900
there is no explaining these things

1374
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,000
we've all seen how the public turns. Maybe we can turn them back

1375
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,160
I've got a swell skit lined up for you

1376
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,210
about...about Esther

1377
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,300
uh..

1378
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
you think that i'm going to get in her way

1379
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,200
well as a matter of fact as it happens, there's no part in the story for her

1380
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,000
I'd more or less planned to star her in a picture of her own

1381
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,700
With uh..that young Pemberton opposite her

1382
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,080
he's coming along nicely

1383
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,600
good for young Pemberton

1384
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:48,500
alright Oliver... let's make a try at it. Lets hope it's not too late

1385
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,300
Get with the Oliver Niles Productions

1386
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:15,180
No argument...I'd buy those.

1387
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:24,100
Screens most finished actor... haha.. I'll say he's finished...He keeps them a way in droves.

1388
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,500
<u>Theater Men's Guide</U>
Norman Maine Contract With Niles Cancelled

1389
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,200
Theater men who were short sighted enough to buy the Norman Maine pictures on this year's Oliver Niles Schedutle will be...

1390
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,400
glad to learn that they will be released from this burden on them and their audiences.

1391
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,600
Niles has finally bought off the Maine contract for an unknown figure...Orchids to Niles!

1392
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,400
...

1393
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,800
...

1394
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,400
hello

1395
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,150
no... no Miss Lester isn't home as yet

1396
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:21,110
no I am not the butler

1397
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:24,630
but I can take a message just as well as he can honestly

1398
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:30,960
Oh... Is that you Norman? Swell! Listen Norman this is Arty Carver

1399
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:36,520
How are you kid? Swell. Say I hear your thru with Oliver Niles...

1400
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,900
That on the Level?

1401
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,300
Oh please Arty I'm not news anymore forget it.

1402
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,100
Say what kind of a settlement did you make on your contract?

1403
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:47,090
Give me a figure so I can do a story on it.

1404
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,400
No money involved...we just called it quits.

1405
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,100
Ok, Ok, I'll fill in my own figure.

1406
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,900
Say by the way. I've been trying to get an interview with Vicky for two weeks but she's always busy...

1407
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:03,200
How about you give an old pal a break by speaking to her for me?

1408
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,040
Sure I'll ask her.

1409
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,800
Swell. So long. Heh

1410
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,300
I didn't mean to be late darling but Kacy wanted me... It's all right.

1411
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,420
Your here now.

1412
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,600
What's new today?

1413
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,400
Nothing...Haven't been out of the house.

1414
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,480
Lets go somewhere tonight.

1415
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh no no your tired we'll stay in.

1416
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:36,880
I'm not tired really.

1417
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,400
Oh you are... you've got a hard day ahead of you...

1418
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,500
anyway I see you little of you I'd like to have you to myself..

1419
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,940
Oh but it's the servents night out and we
haven't any dinner made... Yes we have...

1420
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:50,060
I fix a little snake with my own lily white hands.

1421
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:51,810
Hey ah...

1422
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,300
I'm learning to cook in my spare time. Then I think I'll marry you..

1423
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,800
Oh I get it.

1424
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,090
You want to make an honest cook of me huh?

1425
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,420
Comes in on wheels in this joint.

1426
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,620
Here you are...how's it look?

1427
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:29,700
Hmm...wonderful!

1428
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:32,060
That's what I thought.

1429
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,830
Now there don't be formal just pitch in.

1430
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,790
Here you are.

1431
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,010
I'm afraid my mouths not quite big enough.

1432
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,200
I'll measure next time and make them to size.

1433
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:01,230
A little hard to nip too.

1434
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,990
I'll take the hint...I'll take those measurements right now.

1435
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,160
That's what I wait for...

1436
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:25,150
That's why I rush home without even changing my costume.

1437
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:34,040
Wait.. We're forgetting that we're hungry...Would you like a sandwich?

1438
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:37,080
No Thank you I still have a little work on this one.

1439
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,500
Now...Oh...Heh...

1440
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,000
Norman will you unhook my dress, I can't breathe

1441
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:57,150
And all the time I thought it was the kiss that made you breathless.

1442
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,660
a lot of hooks, why don't you have a zipper?

1443
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,810
good idea

1444
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,000
feel better?

1445
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,930
don't look now but uh...

1446
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:22,400
I think that guy on your left is in love with you

1447
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,900
Door bell. Is it?

1448
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,810
Maybe they'll go away.

1449
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,200
Oh they never do at a time like this.

1450
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,490
Just a minute dear... I'll be right back.

1451
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,500
does Vicky Lester live here? I've got a package for her

1452
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,370
and who are you?

1453
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,440
I'm her husband

1454
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,630
Sign right here Mr.Lester

1455
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,150

1456
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,990
by the way i forgot to tell you uh...

1457
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:37,400
they want you for a benefit shrine auditorium next Wednesday night

1458
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,410

1459
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,100
darling, i don't want to hear about that now

1460
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,700
you better wait till i finish before i forget them all

1461
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:50,050
uhm.. the academy dinner secretary phoned

1462
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,920
she wants to know if you want a table reserved for you

1463
01:17:54,100 --> 01:18:01,300
Oh Yes Arty Carver called and ask if I'd use my influence with you to get him an interview.

1464
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,400
I told him I'd try. Ah that was all I think.

1465
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,100
Oh Norman please don't talk about those things now.

1466
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:13,120
We're forgetting the wonderful food you prepared.

1467
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:17,600
Hmm... I'm not very hungry now...I think I'll ah...

1468
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:20,530
I'll fix a little drink. Hmm...

1469
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:24,270
Norm...

1470
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,800
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

1471
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,000
Eighth Annual Awards of Merit Banquet.

1472
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,800
I wish Norman would come.

1473
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,410
Stop worrying.

1474
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,040
Think how nice that statue is going to look on your mantle piece.

1475
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,700
You suppose anythings happened to him?

1476
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,400
Of course not, he's just been held up in traffic. You just think about that statuette.

1477
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:57,100
Now we arrive at the climax of the annual dinner of the Academy of Motion Picture of Arts and Science.

1478
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,840
The highest award within our power to bestow.

1479
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,500
We've already uploaded with our harts as well as our hands.

1480
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,060
While awards have been given those gentleman

1481
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:11,260
who during the past year have rendered distinguished service to the motion picture industry.

1482
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,820
We now pay honour to the ladies.

1483
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:15,600
Or rather to one lady.

1484
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,700
We offer to her the academy award of the finest performance of the past year.

1485
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,000
She has already had the world's acclaim

1486
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,350
but this is the tribute of our fellow workers,

1487
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,430
the men and women of this industry.

1488
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,900
It is not only my pleasure but my privilege

1489
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:36,200
to give this award to the actress who created the unforgettable actress of Anna in Green without end.

1490
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:39,170
Miss Vicky Leicester.

1491
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,400
What more can we say miss Leicester. This says it all for us.

1492
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:23,810
Lady's and gentlemen's! When something like this happens to you and you try to

1493
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,640
count how you feel about it, you find out that

1494
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,170
Out of the all the words in the world there are only two

1495
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,800
words that would mean anything:

1496
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,700
Thank you! All I can do is to say them to you from my heart.

1497
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,900
All I can do is

1498
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,700
All I can do is keep on saying them...

1499
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:48,700
Hey! That's fine. All this thing. Please!
That's a very pretty speech my dear. Very pretty!

1500
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,220
You said what I think. I wanna be the very first

1501
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,400
I wanna be the very first to congratulate you. But..

1502
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:58,410
I'm not a valuable piece of... Now I wanna make a speech.

1503
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,530
Now I wanna make a speech.

1504
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:04,160
Gentleman of the Academy and fellow suckers

1505
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:09,900
I got one of those for the best performance, they don't mean a thing. People get them every year.

1506
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:12,320
What I want is a special award.

1507
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:14,660
Something nobody else can get.

1508
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,490
I wanna statue of the worst performance of the year.

1509
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,610
In fact I want three statues.

1510
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,940
For the three worst performances of the year, because I've earned them.

1511
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,690
And every single one of you

1512
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:33,100
that saw those last masterpieces of mine knows I've earned them.

1513
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,670
Liby start the music.

1514
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,800
What I'm here to find out is, do I get 'em or do I get 'em?

1515
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,210
As or yes or no? *splash*

1516
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:55,530
Come on darling! Let's put on some ice!

1517
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,600
Come on Owen put some aid!

1518
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,700
That's clear Owen. Hello, Norman!

1519
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,900
Hi! How are you? Hi, Owen!

1520
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,100
Hi Owen! My dear,

1521
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,170
My dear do let me congratulate you. You must be very proud

1522
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,700
You must be very proud and happy tonight.

1523
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,050
Thank you!

1524
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,100
Tony give me a drink!

1525
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Albert nice of you to come to my venue. Vicky how are you? I missed you!

1526
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,200
Everyone missed you! Had a nice trip?

1527
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,700
Well the three months tour that get us out of... because of out of pleasure

1528
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,470
But the way they were screaming for your pictures all over the country,

1529
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,400
Esleka if I may talk shot you are Enaka.

1530
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,980
Thank you! Is good to hear that.

1531
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,480
You've been crying. A little

1532
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,550
A little. How is Norman?

1533
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,760
How is Norman?

1534
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,000
Rough he's trying hard for all of us.

1535
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,640
Letting Norman leave the studio was the hardest thing I ever do. There was nothing else I could do.

1536
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,400
There was nothing else I could do. I know.

1537
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,430
I know. Have you been .

1538
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:50,080
Have you been .. Is he alright?

1539
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:52,700
He got to the sanatarium

1540
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,950
He really wanted that prix. Now I think he could only...

1541
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:03,960
Well, I'll have to start working again, it'll be some encouragement.

1542
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,890
Oliver, could you... could you do that?

1543
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,440
Oh, thank you. But he mustn't ever know I told you.

1544
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:17,950
He won't know, and you mustn't worry. I want you to keep up your good work in this

1545
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,700
It's the one thing I can do for you.

1546
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,800
If you'll just sit here, Mr.Niles , I'll have Mr. Maindorf down.
 -Thank you.

1547
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,220
Or not.

1548
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,800
Hello Oliver! Welcome to Liberty Hall.

1549
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,600
Hello Norman. Well,

1550
01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:02,860
... This is just a handshake

1551
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:06,260
This is Cuddle, Oliver, my social secretary.

1552
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,280
We, we go everywhere together.

1553
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,100
How're you feeling Norman? Alright?

1554
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,280
I'm getting on remarkably well,

1555
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,020
You oughta see some of the boys. (whistles)

1556
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:17,150
Go sit down.

1557
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,990
Cuddles, we really don't need you.

1558
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,800
Are you comfortable here, Norman?
 -Comfortable? It's positively luxurious.

1559
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,800
They even have iron bars on the windows to keep out the drought.

1560
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,000
How much longer are you gonna be here?

1561
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:46,010
Hang on for the next week or two to get in good shape.

1562
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:52,220
After all, there is no particular hurry to return to the cameras.

1563
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,280
That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've got a script with a fine part for you in it.

1564
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,300
Ah well that's great. That's great.

1565
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,800
Who... who plays opposite me?

1566
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,900
Well, it is not exactly the lead.

1567
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,800
Young Pimberton's doing that, but I tell you frankly I find your part better than the lead.

1568
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,200
Huh. I see.

1569
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:21,700
Better than the lead?

1570
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,800
Of course it isn't terribly long,

1571
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,100
but it's one of those parts that makes an impression on you.

1572
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,700
They'll be thinking about you all through the picture.
 -Uh huh.

1573
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:34,270
Well, the thing is Oliver, I'm, uh, pretty well settled at another studio.

1574
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:40,360
And I'm not at liberty at the moment to tell you which one, you know yourself how those things are.

1575
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,470
Big picture, One of the biggest of the year and the part

1576
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,700
every actor in Hollywood will give his teeth to play.

1577
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:53,060
Well that's fine Norman, and naturally, that would tie you up for a while, but we won't get to this picture for some time,

1578
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,100
and perhaps, if you want to consider it for later on,

1579
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,500
Well, I tell ya Oliver, you better not count on me.

1580
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:03,510
See, I've got several pictures lined up after this, and then they're talking to me about England

1581
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You know, they're doing some very interesting things over there

1582
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,300
Hey

1583
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,600
What is it? Cuddle speak right out. We all love you.

1584
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,600
The dinner.
 -Oh!

1585
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,300
We dine at five thirty here, makes the nights longer.

1586
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,900
Now, goodbye Norman. I'm glad to see you're getting along so well.

1587
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,200
I'll be out in no time.

1588
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:30,200
I'll have to introduce myself all over to a lot of people, won't know when I'm not drinking.

1589
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,200
Goodbye.
 -Goodbye.

1590
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,800
Goodbye Norman.
 -Thanks for dropping in.

1591
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:41,300
Well, cuddles... alone at last.

1592
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,800
Christmas Week
 Racing
 Santa Anita Park

1593
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,100
Oh, hello.

1594
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:29,500
-Hello
-Hello

1595
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:32,260
Hello, Norman.

1596
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,710
I see.

1597
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,790
How I hate to run into these has-beens.

1598
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,800
Give me the creeps.

1599
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,010
Me too.

1600
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,600
He was good while he had it.

1601
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,560
And he had it quite a while.

1602
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,600
-Hello
-Hello Mr. Maine

1603
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:54,400
-I haven't seen you in a long time.
-Ah, I've been resting

1604
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:56,520

Why it's Mr. America of yesteryear.

1613
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:20,250
Do they let you wander about now without a keeping?

1614
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,120
I didn't expect to find you an Santa Anita.

1615
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:29,510
What do they do with the actors when you're away?

Oh, they cut them into slices and fry them with eggs.

01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,690
Suppose you'll be here all the time

1618
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:45,600
Now that you've retired from the hurly-burly of the silver screen.

01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:52,500
Well, I'm living down in Malibu now. Pretty lonesome with Esther away working all day.

1620
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,800
I wouldn't squawk about that if I were you.

1621
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,390
It's nice having somebody in the family making a living.

Oh Well, I'm gonna tell you.

1623

You can live off your wife now. She'll buy you drinks and put up with you even though nobody else will.

1631
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,900
Wait a minute, Wait a minute...

But...

1731
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:28,240

<i>Norman Maine's body found of Malibu
Ex-Star perishes in tragic accident!</i>

1771
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:43,900
First drink of water he had in twenty years.
Then, he had to get it by accident.

1772
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:45,850
(Laughing)

1773
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,700
but how do you write congratulations to the Pacific Ocean?

1774
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,500
(Laughing)

1775
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,000
There he is now!

1776
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,320
Oh! You can't see a thing.

1777
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:06,430
Hello Vicki!

1778
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,800
-Get away, can't you?
-Come on, Vicki! Let's see your face.

1779
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,800
Vicki, will you sign my book for me?
Write "This is Norman Maine".

1780
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,100
Don't you care, Vicki. You'll get over it.

1781
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,200
Stand back, can't you?

1782
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,060
Don't you cry, dearie! He wasn't so much!

1783
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:10,260
Do you mind if I take just... one more look?

1784
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:34,230
Here are the paychecks for the servants, Graves.

1785
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,630
You'll find a very nice bonus in each one.

1786
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:39,800
Miss Nasta asked me to thank you for your kindness and service.

1787
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:43,300
If there is anything i can do for the little lady, i should be glad to do it.

1788
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,600
She would appreciate your attending to the ??

1789
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:48,630
Be careful with that!

1790
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,200
Put it down, I say!

1791
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:54,600
Well? Where is she?

1792
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,400
I-In the bedroom, who are you?

1793
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,500
Oh, I'm her grandmother. Get out of the way!

1794
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,000
Hey

1795
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:05,700
Granny, darling!

1796
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,500
Oh I'm so glad to see you. What made you come?

1797
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:12,300
Oh I know when I'm needed.

1798
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:15,400
Now get out of here! Go on, get out of here, all of you!

1799
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,580
I want to talk to my grand-daughter alone.

1800
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,500
I came just as quickly as i could.

1801
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:23,200
But I'm going home. I sent you a ride yesterday.

1802
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:29,300
Hm! Sit down!

1803
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:34,880
Is it true that you're going to uit the movie?

1804
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,100
I never want to hear them again.

1805
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,500
What''re you running away from?

1806
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:44,800
I'm not running away.

1807
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:47,940
It's just that i can't go on. My heart isn't there anymore.

1808
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:53,500
Once i told you to get what you want to have to give your heart in exchange

1809
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,000
And you said, you will win, remember?

1810
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:58,910
I remember.

1811
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:03,100
Seems to me that you got more than you were bargaining for.

1812
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:07,830
More fame. More success. Even more, personal happiness.

1813
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:11,000
Maybe, more unhappiness.

1814
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:17,410
But you did make a bargain and now you're whining over it.

1815
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:21,530
I don't think i'd feel so very proud of myself, if i were you

1816
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:25,300
I'm not Granny, my mind's made up

1817
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:31,800
But Granny-
 I was proud of you Esther.

1818
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:35,700
I was proud to be the grandmother of Esther.

1819
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:40,900
It gave me something to live for. Now, I haven't any.

1820
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:48,350
I know. i wanna be strong but I can't go on.

1821
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:53,200
You must. Tragedy is a test of courage.

1822
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:57,000
If you can meet it bravely, it will leave you bigger than it found you.

1823
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:01,010
If not, then you'll have to live all your life as a coward.

1824
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:05,630
Because no matter where you may run, you can never run away from yourself.

1825
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,030
I never knew Norman Maine.

1826
01:47:10,250 --> 01:47:13,410
He wrote me a very sweet letter when you were married.

1827
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,310
He said you told him how much I meant to you.

1828
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:21,820
And I know just how much you must meant to him.

1829
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:27,190
You know, Esther. I can't believe that whenever you meet

1830
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:29,100
he can be very happy

1831
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:34,860
knowing that he just broke the spirit of the little girl he praised me so highly

1832
01:47:34,930 --> 01:47:38,400
and I can't believe that he can be very proud

1833
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:42,720
knowing that all the great love is to you

1834
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:46,500
was to make me a Putter(?)

1835
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,550
The car is ready Ms. Esther. You'll have to go now to make the train.

1836
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,020
Put the car back in the garage.

1837
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:25,380
The girl who has won the heart of Hollywood.

1838
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:27,470
The girl who has won the heart of the world.

1839
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:29,340
Ms. Vicki Lester!

1840
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:34,180
And if i'm not mistaken, Ms. Lester's car has just been arrived.

1841
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,800
Yes, it is here!

1842
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:54,800
I scare very slowly, young man!

1843
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:56,580
smile folks, please!

1844
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,750
They'll have your mug-

1845
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:08,400
I mean, your face plastered across half
 the papers in the country tomorrow
 - Hm how do i look?

1846
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:10,510
Oh you look well

1847
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:12,300
You're a liar, but I like ya.

1848
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:14,080
and here Mrs.Lester Grandmother.

1849
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:16,700
Would you say a few words to the radio audience, please?

1850
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,360
Say something, lady

1851
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:25,000
You know, we've got a thing like that back home where they all listen
You know but we call it a pathy-line

1852
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:25,900
(Laughing)

1853
01:49:25,910 --> 01:49:28,340
Won't you say something, please? They're listening.

1854
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:35,140
Maybe some of you people listening
 in dream about coming to Hollywood.

1855
01:49:35,190 --> 01:49:38,270
Maybe some of you will get pretty discouraged.

1856
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:42,280
Well, when you do, you just think about me.

1857
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:44,550
It took me over seventy—

1858
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:49,520
sixty years to get here, but here I am

1859
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,850
and here I mean to stay.

1860
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:54,600
(Applause and laughing)
Thank you very much.

1861
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,900
Norman Maine
GOOD LUCK

1862
01:50:05,790 --> 01:50:07,350
Miss Lester

1863
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,700
This microphone is on an international hookup.

1864
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,900
Throughout the world, your fans are hoping
that you'll say a few words to them.

1865
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,630
Hello, everyone...

1866
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,750
This is Mrs. Norman Maine.

1867
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:39,300
ESTHER AT MICROPHONE

1868
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,400
Esther
Hello, everybody... This is Mrs. Norman Maine.

1869
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,700
The ovation is tremendous.
CAMERA MOVES IN TO BIG CLOSEUP OF ESTHER.

1870
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:49,000
Tears are starting down her cheeks.
She looks out past all this crowd, this confusion,

1871
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,200
this uproar, to some distant point of her own.
 The music swells up.
FADE OUT.

1872
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:53,300
THE END.
