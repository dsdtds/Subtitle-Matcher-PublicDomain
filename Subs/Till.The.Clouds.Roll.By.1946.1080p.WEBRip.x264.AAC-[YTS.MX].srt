3
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,290
To we so long for you.

4
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,630
Every day.

5
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,590
The new song for you.

6
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,000
We all Mississippi, we all work.

7
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,387
Loading up.

8
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,853
Are there.

9
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,980
I have God such a wonderful
show with the greatest dramas

10
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,700
and jolly comedies. Stephen
Baker of a handsome,

11
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,590
misleading man and beautiful
Julie Laverne has welcome.

12
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,423
Dozen.

13
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,880
Cares. If my boat goes upstream

14
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,020
or if the gate bids me with the rivers.

15
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,060
I.

16
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,720
The with my fancy.

17
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,040
Sometimes I thank my lucky stars.

18
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,890
And.

19
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,890
Other times I wonder where the mate

20
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,773
for.

21
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,683
Hello.

22
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,300
How do you do?

23
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,060
Are you an actress?

24
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,580
Oh, no, but, but I'd give
anything if I could be.

25
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,470
Why?

26
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:53,760
Well,

27
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,000
because you can make believe
so many wonderful things that

28
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,870
never happen in real life.

29
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,220
Well, if you like to
make believe one thing,

30
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,820
why can't we make believe
we know each other?

31
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,653
The game.

32
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Our dreams are more romantic
than the world we see.

33
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,460
And if the things we
dream don't happen to be,

34
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,540
that's just an, an important technicality.

35
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,740
The you and I have never met.

36
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,137
We need not mine. Mind conventions,

37
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,740
if we,

38
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,213
we

39
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,223
love you

40
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,920
that you love.

41
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,050
Magnolia.

42
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,050
Yes, mother.

43
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,110
Goodbye.

44
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,027
I hope I see you again.

45
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,110
Life upon the wicked stage ain't
ever what a girl suppose as

46
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,380
stage door. Johnny's aren't
raging over you with gems.

47
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,380
And rose says, when you let
a feller hold your hands,

48
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,610
which means an extra beer or sand,

49
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,800
which everybody whispers ain't her life a

50
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:25,900
though,

51
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,900
you are warned against a rue
ruining your ation when you

52
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,080
played around the one night
trade around the great GNA

53
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,510
nation.

54
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,510
Wild only men who give you
jewels and saveable only living

55
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,760
ESOPs, Fs life.

56
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,273
Ed ain't nothing for a girl.

57
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,260
You.

58
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,740
We do.

59
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,210
Not believe you.

60
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,990
There is no doubt you are crazy about.

61
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,590
Your.

62
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,507
Full stage.

63
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,797
If some gentleman would talk with reason,

64
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,400
I would cancel all next season.

65
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,280
Life on the wicked stage ain't nothing.

66
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,910
Listen, sister, I love my Mr.

67
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,910
Man and I came tell you why.

68
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,670
There ain't no reason
for me to love that man.

69
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,777
It must be something

70
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,610
that the angels done.

71
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,250
Fish gotta swim.

72
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,700
Birds.

73
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,890
Gotta fly.

74
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:45,450
I got a love one man to die.

75
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,170
Tell me I'm crazy.

76
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Maybe I know can hurt.

77
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,680
Loving that

78
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,360
he goes away,

79
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,060
can come home as late as can be.

80
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,590
He must know something.

81
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,350
But don't say.

82
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,453
You'll run over a year. Well, all.

83
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,640
That was a swell show, Mr.

84
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,560
Kind.

85
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,920
Well, thank you Joe.

86
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,210
That too. The Waldorf Mr.

87
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,043
Kind.

88
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,760
What was that, Joe?

89
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,170
That Big s Shinda get thrown for you.

90
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,410
It's down at the Waldorf, ain't it?

91
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,510
Mr. Kind?

92
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,110
Yes.

93
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,370
But first I'd like to stop
off at the house of an old

94
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,160
friend. Yes sir.

95
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,840
Just for a moment, Joe.

96
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,680
Turn right at the next crossing.

97
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,180
It's not very far.

98
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,193
I'm looking for an old brownstone house.

99
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,760
It was the home of a very
great and good friend tonight

100
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,140
during the show. I couldn't
seem to get him off my mind.

101
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
Yes, listen.

102
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,920
And I'd like to be alone
for a few minutes, Joe,

103
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,160
before we go down to the
Waldorf and face that crowd. Oh,

104
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
I get you. Like, like a minute of silence.

105
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,790
Something like that, huh?

106
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,400
Yeah, it's Joe.

107
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,067
Something like that.

108
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,990
Here, stop here, Joe.

109
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,907
Here at the corner in
front of that radio shop.

110
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,620
Oh, there it is.

111
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,860
See you.

112
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,830
You mean that that lodging
house sandwiched in there?

113
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,120
Well,

114
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,750
of course it didn't have that
room to let sign of the window

115
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,130
then.

116
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,420
Other than that, it
hasn't changed very much.

117
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,300
The street has changed.

118
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,180
It changed quite a bit since
I first walked down it years

119
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,013
ago.

120
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,510
Joe, as you notice this radio shop, well,

121
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,720
that was a bicycle shop the
first time I ever saw it.

122
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,900
I remember the day very well.

123
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,440
It was spring and I might have
been any American kid coming

124
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
down that street.

125
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,780
I had a song under my
arm. My hopes were high.

126
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,840
And the world was wonderful.

127
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,700
I was ambitious and I was eager,
but I needed a little help.

128
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,240
I'd been told that the best
man to give it to me was a man

129
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,650
by the name of Hassler.

130
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,817
James Hassler.

131
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,260
Come in. Come in.

132
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,640
You're an hour late already.

133
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,920
I suppose you'll realize that
you can start on the upstairs

134
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,460
bedroom immediately.

135
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,830
Mrs. Mueller daddy wants
some more roast beef.

136
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,120
I'll.

137
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,990
Be there in a second, Mr.

138
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,880
Hessler, and see that
you get to their nest.

139
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Young man. He's.

140
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,500
Not the more killer.

141
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,480
I'm a songwriter.

142
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
A songwriter.

143
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
I see you entered under
false pretenses. Well,

144
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,560
it won't do you any good young man. Mr.

145
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,630
Hestor isn't seeing songwriters anymore.

146
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,250
He's going in for better things.

147
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,920
Maybe he.

148
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,320
Should have a rose beef. He's
very, don't mention rose beef.

149
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,810
In front of a songwriter.

150
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,180
Gimme a snack here.

151
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,270
No. So it's, so.

152
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,230
It's you feel like a fall
down thing, don't you Dear.

153
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,070
Dear?

154
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,080
Well, you can come in for a while.

155
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,700
I can't have people fainting in the house.

156
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,550
Not even songwriters. Thank you.

157
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,967
Come in. Come in.

158
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,990
Daddy.

159
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,640
He's starving to death. Mr.

160
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,580
Ler.

161
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,380
Mr. Maxey.

162
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,080
Yes. Yes, I know.

163
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,740
I know. Mr.

164
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,840
Max Dreyfuss of the harms
company sent you grit.

165
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,900
Little tune. He thinks
it has possibilities.

166
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,830
If it's properly arranged now
I'm to help you arrange it.

167
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,140
Look.

168
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,350
How skinny his neck is, daddy.

169
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,640
Well,

170
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,840
he said that he told you that
I was the greatest arranger in

171
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,580
American. I should give
you a few lessons though.

172
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,080
Oh, my friend.

173
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,100
He is right. There's only one
catch I've given up arranging.

174
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,780
I'm through dressing up silly
little tunes for girl shows

175
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,060
and beer halls.

176
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,900
I'm gonna write some
real music for a change.

177
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Oh, I hear Mrs.

178
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,820
Set it down here.

179
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,660
The trouble with you songwriters
is all you ever think about

180
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,270
is making money.

181
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,940
Here. Sit down, have some roast beef.

182
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,060
Oh, well, no, thank you.

183
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,840
Go ahead. Sit down.

184
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,060
Sit down.

185
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,200
Oh, you never think of doing anything big,

186
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,160
anything worthwhile like
Brahms or peach? Oh no, don't,

187
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,220
don't sit down there please.

188
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,920
That's Mrs.

189
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,660
Kessler's place rest is So we
always keep it set for, oh,

190
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm.

191
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Sorry. Yeah.

192
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,500
Sit down here.

193
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:39,900
No,

194
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,920
all you fellas want to do is
write sugary little tombs and

195
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,580
make a lot of money.

196
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,420
Did you ever hear Beethoven's
Roka or Mozart's Jupiter?

197
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,570
Didn't they do something to you? Great.

198
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,990
Evans, doesn't genius
touch you fellas at all?

199
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,407
Daddy's a genius.

200
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,260
Yes. Daddy's a genius.

201
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,620
No, my friend.

202
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,280
In three weeks I'm going to
England where I can work.

203
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,540
I have some peace and quiet.

204
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,320
No mushy little melodies
to be fancied up for public

205
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
consumption.

206
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,950
I'm gonna write a symphony.

207
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,550
Daddy's gonna write it
off for just for me.

208
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,280
Here. Go ahead.

209
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,920
Go ahead. Eat up.

210
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,670
Maybe we'll give you some gumption.

211
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,020
Well, I'm terribly sorry Mr.

212
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,760
Hesler. I had a big lunch with Mr.

213
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,093
Dreyfuss just before I left.

214
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,510
It was roast beef too.

215
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,040
Yeah, well I, oh, it's matter.

216
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,680
Just 'cause you're not hungry.
You don't have to go to,

217
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,630
you have some brandy with me.

218
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,100
Help me celebrate my
liberation from mediocrity.

219
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,020
Mrs.

220
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,200
Get a couple of liquor
glasses. Will you, Sally,

221
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,420
will you show Mr. The
gentleman into the parlor?

222
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,560
I'm going upstairs and see
if I can find that bottle in

223
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,393
Napoleon.

224
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,060
Have you a song in there.

225
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,570
I'm taking piano lessons.

226
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,180
Daddy wants me to be an
opera singer when I grow up.

227
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,350
Why don't you write an opera?

228
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,860
Well, Sally, I'm afraid I only
write the silly little tunes.

229
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,980
You know the ones your
father doesn't like?

230
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,920
Let me see if I can play
your song. Do you mind?

231
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,087
I wish you would. It's very easy here.

232
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,420
Color, color, color.

233
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,440
What's the name of the.

234
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,580
Song? Kaa.

235
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,110
That's a funny name. Sounds like candy.

236
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,670
Like gun drops.

237
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:18,960
Well,

238
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,543
it's the name of a very
romantic beach in a wise Sally.

239
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,417
No, that's b b natural.

240
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,663
Here, let me show you.

241
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,150
Now the melody.

242
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,080
Should.

243
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,380
Be played with clarinets.

244
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,240
Oh, no, no, no.

245
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,407
Wait a minute.

246
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,240
No, that's not right.

247
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,100
You've got to use
clarinets to play the vamp.

248
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,530
Oh, I was thinking of using brass there.

249
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,600
Brass. And spoil your finish.

250
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,200
Good heavens, man.

251
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,620
You've always got to save
the brass for the finish.

252
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,970
Oh, well, what do you think?

253
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,700
Think I know. This is a romantic song.

254
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,540
Sit down. It's sentimental.

255
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,400
You got to start the melody
off with your strings deza.

256
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,200
Here I'll show you. Start that vamp again.

257
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,033
Sally.

258
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,280
It's perfect for clarinet.
See not in the strings.

259
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,113
Center de.

260
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,057
And you hear how wonderful that is.

261
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,447
Not in that trombones trombones.

262
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,133
That's great. Can't you
just hear that, Sally?

263
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,840
No, no, no, no.

264
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,700
Wait a minute.

265
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,450
We ought to add flutes
there. Light and easy.

266
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Now then add your breath strength too.

267
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,580
Yeah. You see?

268
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,600
Isn't that easy?

269
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,390
It's a good song too. It's very good.

270
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,973
Is that yours? Yes.

271
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,510
That's, that's alright.

272
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,800
What's your name again?

273
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,320
Kern. Jerome Kern.

274
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,670
Well, I'm glad to meet you, Kern.

275
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,220
Make yourself at home.

276
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,860
And I did.

277
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,120
My life became a pattern
of notes, clips, tempos,

278
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,120
and modulations. We worked
hour after hour, day after day.

279
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,543
It was the beginning of a friendship.

280
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,460
It was the beginning of a lot of things.

281
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,720
And now not only did I have a best friend,

282
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,220
I had a best girl.

283
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,220
Sally.

284
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,553
And what a girl.

285
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,420
Oh, those were never to be forgotten days.

286
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,620
And I hated to think of the mending.

287
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,200
But at last,

288
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,900
the time came when Jim
had to leave for England.

289
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,960
Oh, here Jim.

290
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,210
Lemme help you.

291
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,880
Those, those symphonies of yours.

292
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,200
They're as heavy and bulky as
let Nice, they're not tinny.

293
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,180
Like some tunes I've heard.

294
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,513
Oh, Sally, honey, come here.

295
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,630
Alright, here we go.

296
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,463
VTIs.

297
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,260
Got it.

298
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,980
Oh, you carry a lot of weight, Sally.

299
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,200
It.

300
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,510
Was easy.

301
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,380
Come along, Sally.

302
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,830
At least we are not gonna
miss the boat. Goodbye Mr.

303
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,900
Kern. Goodbye.

304
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,350
Mrs.

305
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,340
Goodbye. Sally.

306
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,310
Bo.

307
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,600
What.

308
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,530
Does that mean?

309
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,697
Happy journey.

310
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,660
Bye Uncle Jerry.

311
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,827
Be a good boy.

312
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,250
This will be the end of it, boys.

313
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,300
Don't forget to pack my song. Daddy.

314
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,560
No, I'm good.

315
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,420
She means Kaa. All that is her song.

316
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,280
Jim, you know, if it
hadn't have been for Sally,

317
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,070
I wouldn't be here now.

318
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,580
Well, she's very fond of you, Jerry.

319
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,180
I'm gonna miss her.

320
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,900
I'm gonna miss all of you.

321
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,160
We, we may not be gone so long.

322
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,160
It all depends on, you won't
mind living here alone,

323
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,800
will you? Oh, no, no.

324
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,900
I'll get used to it, Jim,

325
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,920
in case I don't get a chance at the boat.

326
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,060
I just wanted to tell you that.

327
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,760
Oh, forget it.

328
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,500
I, I like arranging now
that I'm through with it.

329
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,340
Glad to have been some help.
No, it's more than that.

330
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,060
It's been your kindness in your home here.

331
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,460
Look, Jerry, I just want you
to write some good music,

332
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,130
some real music.

333
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,910
That's all the thanks I want. Don't,

334
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,880
don't waste your time fussing
with those squeezy little

335
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,690
tunes. Think big.

336
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,710
Try to be somebody I will. Jim.

337
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,540
I'll try to be as big
as I can. Yeah, good.

338
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,373
It's fine.

339
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,660
Well, you better be on her way.

340
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,910
Oh, good Heaven Sally song.

341
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,760
You know, I'm so tickled
that she remembered that.

342
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,340
Remember, that's your song, dear.

343
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,090
She couldn't do that.

344
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,540
I stood there watching that
boat pull out of the harbor,

345
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,080
and I was lonelier than
I'd ever been in my life.

346
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
I walked through the days
that followed from office to

347
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,100
office, theater to theater,

348
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,380
always getting the same
discouraging answer.

349
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,130
The big hits were all English or European,

350
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,880
where the local talent just
didn't seem to have a chance.

351
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,720
Broadway was closed to an
American from 23rd Street at Times

352
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,300
Square. They were all
playing Follow the leader.

353
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:11,520
And.

354
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,687
The leader was Charles Ro.

355
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:15,950
The.

356
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,540
Moment.

357
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,490
He's with Keller, Cecil
Keller, the English composer.

358
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:20,720
Mr.

359
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,380
Pearlman's not interested in
American songs at the moment.

360
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,420
He's leaving for England in a few weeks.

361
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,253
Good day.

362
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,930
How do you do? My name
is Kern Jerome Kern.

363
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,870
Oh yes. How do you do, sir?

364
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,470
I see you have the deeds with you. Mr.

365
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,320
Pearlman's. Very anxious to see them.

366
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,330
Deeds.

367
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,350
You're the man from the
real estate office, aren't.

368
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,830
You? No, I'm a songwriter.

369
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,260
These are some of my songs.

370
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,130
Your name isn't Kernan.

371
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,530
No. Kern, Jerome Kern.

372
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,370
I'm sorry. Mr.

373
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,790
Fryman hasn't a minute
to waste, I'm afraid.

374
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,870
I must say good days. Well, maybe.

375
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,070
If he'd listened to one of my songs,

376
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,860
I have one that could
be made Very English.

377
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,110
Good days, sir.

378
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,323
Goodbye Mr. Proman.

379
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,740
Goodbye Mr. Keller.

380
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,760
I'll see you in London soon.
I'll call you when I get there.

381
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,177
Thank you. I'll be waiting for your call.

382
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,340
I made up my mind that I was
going to try to write music

383
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,530
with an English accent.

384
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,350
So I sailed for London.

385
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,170
I wish I could say with flags
flying in my courage high.

386
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,170
But the sea and I and the boat
get along to well together.

387
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:34,710
I was mighty glad to see land again.

388
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,670
Excuse me. Could you tell me where Mr.

389
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,010
Hessler lives?

390
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,850
Kesler. We have a Jay and we have a Smith.

391
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,250
No hessler. Mr.

392
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,440
Jim Hessler.

393
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Uncle Jerry.

394
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,530
Sally.

395
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,060
Oh, honey.

396
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,330
It's so good to see you.

397
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,500
We didn't know you were coming.

398
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,120
Well, I didn't know I was myself.

399
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,330
Daddy will be so glad to see you.

400
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:06,570
Oh.

401
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,653
Nevada there.

402
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:13,290
Oh, Sally, you're getting
prettier every day.

403
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,123
Yes.

404
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,830
Well, the tables are turned.

405
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,830
American songwriter invades England.

406
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,290
That's pretty good, Jerry.

407
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,050
That's daring. Very original.

408
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,140
You're thinking big. Anyway.

409
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,850
It's a chance I'm taking Jim.

410
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,350
So you've gotten a little
skinnier, haven't you?

411
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,090
I haven't been getting enough
roast beef lately. I guess.

412
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,280
Jerry, I,

413
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,440
I look at you sitting there
and it's just hard for me to

414
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,950
believe you haven't been here
all the time. Thanks, Jim.

415
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,867
It's sort of like being home again.

416
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,340
How was the symphony
coming along? Alright.

417
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,100
Oh, well, yes.

418
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,300
I'm, I'm still in the note making stages.

419
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,710
Of course, I always believe
in making plenty of notes.

420
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,560
It's, it's kinda like
planting seed wonder.

421
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,840
They start to grow and
then for, you know, it,

422
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,140
lo and behold, your symphony's
all written simple and easy.

423
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,430
Not as difficult as writing
those silly little tunes.

424
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,840
Well, no, it's, it's the
quiet here that does it.

425
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,360
Jerry Peace in this place is
just so thick that you can

426
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,070
float on it. There's a,
it's a rustic pastoral.

427
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,520
Wait, wait.

428
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,820
Now answer that telephone.

429
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,520
Oh, the doorbell.

430
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,420
Will you get the door? Please?

431
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,700
Do something about, yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,890
No, there's a, there's
a picturesque pastoral.

433
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,340
Hello. So sorry.

434
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,280
But you know the who sometimes they're.

435
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,760
On.

436
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,100
I can't, she's waiting for piano lessons.

437
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,470
Oh, Mr.

438
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,600
Edwards. Oh yeah.

439
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
Put him on. Come Sally.

440
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,350
It's time for Hello George.

441
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,320
Fine.

442
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,680
I don't.

443
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,180
Want tomorrow. I'll be glad to.

444
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm not.

445
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,300
Gonna have a lesson.

446
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,830
For dinner. Good behavior.

447
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,760
Alright, I'll be there.

448
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,900
Bye-Bye.

449
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,420
George Edwards, the producer.

450
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:03,660
Yes.

451
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,760
He wants me to come up and
sit in on a rehearsal of a new

452
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,090
show.

453
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,780
Piano lesson. I'll Jerry's here.

454
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,120
You've got to talk to your daughter.

455
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,670
I can't do a thing with her anymore.

456
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,310
Well.

457
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,280
This is Uncle Jerry's first day here,

458
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,540
and I shouldn't be made
to take lessons. Should I?

459
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,590
Should I Uncle Jerry?

460
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,800
Well, I, I think you
should have one day off.

461
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,940
Maybe. Huh?

462
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,840
That's the end of her.

463
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,940
There was some hope for her
until her uncle Jerry arrived.

464
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,960
Now she's spoiled for good and all come.

465
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,210
We get myself a cup of tea.

466
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,360
Oh, Sally, I'm inclined to agree with you.

467
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,540
I think Uncle Jerry's arrival
does call for a celebration.

468
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,310
Now.

469
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,140
Will it be London or the fair?

470
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,380
Oh, the fair Daddy, please.

471
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,450
The fair.

472
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,340
Right.

473
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,923
The fair it is, is.

474
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,453
Hey.

475
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,690
Oh, I could be wonderful.

476
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,273
Could be wonderful.

477
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,080
Oh, no, no, Jerry,

478
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,640
I don't want Sally to go up in the swings.

479
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,780
Not until she's a little older.

480
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,200
The whole stage full of swings
and a boy and girl in each

481
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,740
swing and all of them singing.

482
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,630
Oh, you you mean for a production number?

483
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,030
Yeah.

484
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,200
That's not a bad idea.

485
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,570
They could swing from the states
right out over the audience

486
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,840
and back again.

487
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,680
Make a good production number.

488
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,290
What, what song would you use for it?

489
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,330
Spoon With Me. Be Perfect.

490
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,640
Spoon with me. That sounds fine.

491
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,750
Suppose I take that up to
George Edwards for the G Sure.

492
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,333
I'm gonna have dinner with
him tomorrow night. Oh, Jim.

493
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,650
I don't know why I am so very shy.

494
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,770
I always was imu.

495
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,370
I never knew what silly lovers do.

496
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,330
No flirting.

497
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,330
I, in all my life, I never kissed the man.

498
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,890
I never my but now at

499
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:46,990
Ice.

500
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,610
So try

501
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,443
spoon.

502
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,390
I liked spoon.

503
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,360
Whi.

504
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,193
Well.

505
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,370
Tree. Lord, call me

506
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:06,970
how you.

507
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,303
Like to spoon with the name.

508
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,390
How would you like to spoon
with the name beneath Oak Tree?

509
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,920
Large and shiny?

510
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Call me to say what?
See, by you like to, and.

511
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Pardon me for intruding.

512
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,450
You can point it out to
me as the composer of that

513
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,510
delightful number with
the swings in my name.

514
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,460
Isro Charles Roman.

515
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,050
Mr. Kern, I wanna congratulate you.

516
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,260
Roman.

517
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,100
I'm sorry sir. It isn't my number.

518
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,150
My name is Curry.

519
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,150
There's Mr. Rnr down the far bit.

520
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,350
That gentleman there, but
he can't be the composer.

521
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,430
It's him, sir.

522
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,340
Sipping Sherry and a very nice
gentleman. He is too, sir,

523
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,820
for a musician.

524
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,480
Mr. Proman, I have something
here, which I know you'd like.

525
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
It's a beautiful number with Parasols,

526
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,570
with all sorts of parasols.

527
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,253
Mr. Kern.

528
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,960
Oh, Mr.

529
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,780
Reman, how do you do?

530
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,820
I'm very glad to know you.

531
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,520
Mr. Kern.

532
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,860
I want to tell you, I think
your swing number is delightful.

533
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,840
It has such beautiful English charm to it.

534
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,060
Really delightful.

535
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,960
Oh, by Joe, Mr.

536
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,710
Truman. That's, that's rather nice of you.

537
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,000
It's.

538
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,980
A pleasure to know you Mr. Kern.

539
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,660
You know, you fellas
over here have a style,

540
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,690
all your own as English as the
center of the May Blossoms.

541
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,020
Would you join me in a glass of Sherry.

542
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,270
Writer?

543
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,103
Miss

544
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,660
believe.

545
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,720
I'd give that one up if I
were you one song at the gate.

546
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,980
I think you can afford to take a rest.

547
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,040
Or if I could finish it,

548
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,420
I know I could interest Roman in it.

549
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,740
You ought know by now that
Charles Forman is only interested

550
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:46,360
in English music and English composers.

551
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,277
I only had a piano. I know I
could work this out right now.

552
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,830
Flat.

553
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,350
Well, it looks like you do
have a little work to do.

554
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,340
That town we passed wasn't
very far back, was it?

555
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,150
No, not very.

556
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,440
Well,

557
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,320
let me take your bike and
I'll go back and see if I can

558
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,600
borrow a repair kit. No,
I think I'd better go.

559
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,480
I can talk with the natives
better than you can. Well,

560
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,260
let me do it. I can use my accent on them.

561
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,460
That's just what I was afraid of. No,

562
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,680
you wait here and whistle
yourself a little tune till I come

563
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,513
back.

564
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,267
I'll make sure you can find
this place again. I'll find it.

565
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,617
I say, is anyone there?

566
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,940
How do you do?

567
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,470
Did Mr. Timkin sent you?

568
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:55,470
Well, I was passing by on my
bike and I got a flat tire and.

569
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,180
Oh, then you don't work for Mr.

570
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,060
Timkin?

571
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,800
No, no.

572
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,420
I happen to notice your
piano through the window.

573
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,800
So I thought I'd come in
and try a little tune.

574
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,780
I see for a minute. I thought
you were the piano tuner.

575
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,950
No.

576
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,830
Well, I'd better go before the owners.

577
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,840
What do you do here? Gardening.

578
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,660
A little.

579
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,260
Oh, well, I don't know
whether anybody's told you,

580
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,450
but for a working girl,
you're very pretty.

581
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,500
Thank you.

582
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,020
You are an American, aren't you?

583
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,820
Yes.

584
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,940
Yes. I'm a songwriter.

585
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,080
As a matter of fact, that song
I was playing as you came in,

586
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,260
it was mine. Do you like it?

587
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:27,480
Oh.

588
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,150
What? You wrote it yourself?

589
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,450
Sure. Well, I write lots of songs.

590
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,850
Maybe.

591
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,183
Maybe you've heard this one.

592
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,210
Why? That's from the Ities.

593
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,380
Everybody's singing it.

594
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,720
Huh?

595
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Now this is the one I was working on

596
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,760
that I'm gonna try to
place with the gaity too.

597
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,430
Of course I would if I were you.

598
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,410
Don't you believe I wrote these songs?

599
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,280
Tell me, when you compose,

600
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,920
do you always break into
people's houses to borrow their

601
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,130
pianos? Oh.

602
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,160
Alright. I'll tell you what I'll do.

603
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,500
If I place this with the gaity,

604
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,210
I'll send you tickets and you
can come and see for yourself.

605
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:20,500
Will.

606
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,580
You? I'll tell you when I get the tickets.

607
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,680
I beg your pardon, miss.

608
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,190
But your mother would
like to speak to you.

609
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,850
She's in the upstairs sitting
room. Thank you, Katie.

610
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,267
I'll be right up.

611
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,320
Well, I'm terribly sorry,

612
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,480
but I still wrote those songs
and I'll still be waiting for

613
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,350
the tickets.

614
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,510
Will you?

615
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,920
Wonderful.

616
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,503
I I I won't forget.

617
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,310
And you were the Ladd who
wasn't gonna fall in love with

618
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,860
anybody for a long, long time.

619
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,340
Well, this girl is different.

620
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:31,980
Sure. I know.

621
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,800
Well now don't joke
about it. It's serious.

622
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,210
Don't you believe me?

623
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,350
Yes, of course.

624
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,490
I believe.

625
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,590
And she really is different.

626
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,530
I know, I know.

627
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,070
Her hair is like spun
gold shining in the semi.

628
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,770
I know about her hair. She had
a kerchief on, but her eyes,

629
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,910
her eyes were, were like
pools in the starlight.

630
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,910
I see. Even with her working clothes on.

631
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,130
She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen.

632
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,380
I'm sure of it.

633
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,050
Seriously, Jim, don't you believe me?

634
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,070
Yes. Yes, I believe you.

635
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,190
It's spring, isn't it?

636
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:07,630
Tomorrow morning.

637
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:10,270
And I think I'm gonna give
you a great big dose of sulfur

638
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,353
and molasses.

639
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:13,977
Good night.

640
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:33,870
They didn't,

641
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,410
your.

642
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,243
Lips.

643
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,690
Your.

644
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,010
Eyes, your cheeks,

645
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:54,010
your hair are in a class beyond compare

646
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,957
you the loveliest girl.

647
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,780
That one could.

648
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,293
And I

649
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,063
that I

650
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,140
day.

651
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,040
You'll be.

652
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,463
They'll

653
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,280
that from.

654
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,980
Jerry. Isn't it lovely?

655
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,400
Oh, well, I had noticed
when I look at you,

656
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,180
I can't seem to see anything else.

657
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,590
Oh, writing songs again.

658
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,900
Perhaps we better stop
and have lunch. Alright.

659
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,233
You can move in under those trees there.

660
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,430
Isn't it a beautiful day?

661
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,263
Beautiful.

662
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,660
Now let's see.

663
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,700
You've seen Westminster Abbey
and the Tower of London,

664
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,010
and you've seen Buckingham
Palace and Hampton Court.

665
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:56,010
Maybe there's something I can
tell you about this place.

666
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,900
Eva, let's drop the
history coast for a while.

667
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,280
Do you mind? Not that it
isn't interesting, but, well,

668
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,470
there are a few things I'd
like to know about you too.

669
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,430
Well, all right.

670
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,140
What would you like to know about me?

671
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,660
Oh, just the ordinary things.

672
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,740
Things you like and things you don't like,

673
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,020
and where he went to school
and who was your first bow and

674
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,260
oh, what you want out of life.

675
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,530
Mm. That's a tall order.

676
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,540
Where shall I start?

677
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,100
The things you like.

678
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,760
Oh, I, I guess I like what everyone likes.

679
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,390
I like books and, and picnics
and dancing and music.

680
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,500
What about musicians?

681
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,420
Oh, certainly musicians.

682
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,180
And what do you want out of life?

683
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,560
Oh, I guess again, what?

684
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,643
Everyone wants happiness.

685
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,700
Have you ever given any
thought to getting married?

686
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,900
Why? Of course, doesn't everyone?

687
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,460
Are you set on any particular type of man?

688
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,590
Mm, I have been at different times.

689
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:48,640
When I was 16,

690
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,040
I desperately wanted to marry
the star cricket player at

691
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,940
rugby.

692
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,060
And now.

693
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,820
Now, oh,

694
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,640
now I don't really know except
that he must have a sense of

695
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,320
humor and he must be kind and
he must be intelligent and

696
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,740
good company.

697
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,157
And of course, he must love me very much.

698
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,920
Well, I,

699
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,920
I know somebody with at least
one of those characteristics.

700
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,027
Someday I'll tell you all about it.

701
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,000
Oh, good afternoon.

702
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,420
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

703
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,000
And how have you been
this afternoon? Well,

704
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,600
I'll tell you how I've been.
Oh, that's, I've been looking.

705
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,560
Nevermind. Nevermind.

706
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,180
You feel wonderful. You feel great.

707
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,640
How could you be otherwise?
After such a beautiful day?

708
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,700
Tell me, my friend,

709
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,980
how is your knowledge of English
history? English history?

710
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,600
Did you know that London happens
to be the largest city in

711
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,100
the world? Yes, I know that.

712
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,440
Did you know that within
the county of London,

713
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,060
there are 14 road bridges
across the Thames.

714
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,740
Now there's the Waterloo, there's lap.

715
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,230
Do say sounds dull, huh?

716
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,800
Well, it's far from dull, my friend.

717
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,000
When you're a history teacher
is as beautiful as all the

718
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,700
sirens of history put together.

719
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,320
Did you know that all the swans
on the Thames belong to the

720
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,440
King of England? No.

721
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,020
Fancy that. And the male
swan is called a cob.

722
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,300
Oh, what does that get?

723
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,320
And did you know that when
you walk into Hampton Court,

724
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,500
you're walking right
straight into history?

725
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,600
Oh, my dear friend,

726
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,510
you have so many things
to learn about England.

727
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,080
Have you ever heard of a man
named Charles Roro Forman?

728
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,660
Well, now that's a familiar name.

729
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,480
The face escapes me.

730
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,260
How can you talk about Roman
when I'm talking about love?

731
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,100
Oh, so that's been the theme
of this little dissertation?

732
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,700
Yes. Well, I'm glad you informed.

733
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,280
Oh, that's all right.

734
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,350
Because the next time
Roman's office calls,

735
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,580
I'll tell him that you're
too busy to be bothered. Yes.

736
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,163
You tell him that I'm too busy.

737
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,180
Did you say the next time
Roman's office calls?

738
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,140
That's what I said. They've
been calling you all day.

739
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,920
But why should I bore you with
such trivial details? Well,

740
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,440
what do they want? No, no.

741
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,280
Dear friend, you return to your archives.

742
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,540
Why? Think of the future
when the past is so glorious.

743
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,160
Oh, come on.

744
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,830
I quit clowning. What happened?

745
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,140
Nothing. Nothing.

746
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,460
Forman just wants you to write
four songs for his new show.

747
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,800
If of course you can spare the time. Well,

748
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,380
why didn't you tell me about it?

749
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,680
Why didn't I tell you
about it? Well, come on.

750
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,210
Let's get going. There's no time.

751
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,380
We've got to do that on the ship.

752
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,800
On the what? On the ship.

753
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,480
We're sailing with Charles Roman.

754
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,880
Tomorrow we have to start
rehearsal in six weeks in

755
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,713
New York.

756
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,080
Oh, Tim, I, I am.

757
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,657
Oh, no, no.

758
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,737
Look, Jerry, this is the
chance you've been waiting for.

759
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,550
You certainly are full of surprises.

760
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,990
I bet you'd be up in the clouds.

761
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,323
I feel like I've just been
yanked out of the clouds.

762
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,980
Jerry, aren't you coming down for lunch?

763
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,200
Oh, no.

764
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,380
No. Jim, I'm not very hungry.

765
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,700
Oh, look, you've got to snap out of this.

766
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,310
It isn't the end of the
world. It's the beginning.

767
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,680
Here you are on your way back
home with a Charles Fullman

768
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,350
contract in your pocket.

769
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,160
Well, you ought to feel wonderful.

770
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,980
I know it. That's what
I keep telling myself.

771
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,460
You go back England.

772
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,370
If I just could've seen her once more,

773
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,420
Jerry was all we could
do to catch the boat.

774
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,180
You couldn't help that. You
talked to her on the phone.

775
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,230
On the phone.

776
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,970
What can you say on the phone?

777
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,630
Hello. It's nice seeing you.

778
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,260
Take care of yourself.

779
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,800
Oh, Jim,

780
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,420
there were so many things
that I wanted to say to her.

781
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,620
Now look, Jerry, you've got
to think about your career.

782
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,460
Things are just starting for you. Yeah,

783
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,880
you can say that over and over again.

784
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,430
And you know what happens, son?

785
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:41,660
Nothing, Jim.

786
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,030
You know, for the first
time in my life, I'm lonely.

787
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:47,140
Here I am on a ship
full of people with you.

788
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,040
And I might as well be on a
test that island don't all by

789
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:49,873
myself.

790
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,940
Did you ever feel this way?

791
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,350
Yes. Once.

792
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,520
What did you do about it?

793
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,103
I married the girl.

794
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,960
Hell, Mr.

795
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,730
Reman.

796
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,020
Hello there. I've been
looking for you too.

797
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,580
You weren't down at breakfast?

798
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,490
No. I, the first day out is always.

799
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,670
Rough. Well,

800
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,350
good Englishman should
have his sea legs by now.

801
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,040
Come and have lunch.

802
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,840
With me, Mr.

803
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,740
Reman. There's something I must tell you,

804
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,280
I'm not an Englishman, Mr.

805
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,040
Karen, there's something I must tell you.

806
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,480
I never thought that you were
at least not after the first

807
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,860
15 minutes.

808
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,820
Matter of fact,

809
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,400
I'm very proud to be able to
present a new American composer

810
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:29,970
to Broadway.

811
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,200
Thank you, Mr.

812
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,590
I have a lot of faith in your journey.

813
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:35,680
Just received a wireless
from Julius Sanderson.

814
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,980
She's accepted the part of
the girl from Utah. Wonderful.

815
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,080
Now I've got to have.

816
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,900
A great song for him.

817
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,733
If it's a love song, he's got one.

818
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:01,170
When I told how wonderful you're

819
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,380
they, believe.

820
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,433
Me.

821
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,290
Your lips, your eyes, your teeth,

822
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:22,980
your hair are in a glass beyond

823
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,053
handsome.

824
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:40,530
When I tell, and I'm
certainly gonna tell them

825
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,980
that you wife,

826
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,047
you've chosen.

827
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,660
Here.

828
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,890
I've got the clouds number.
Worked out pretty well now.

829
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:48,723
Huh?

830
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,810
I never realized that riding a
complete score was such a job

831
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,740
before.

832
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,910
Well, one good all
night session like this.

833
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,243
There's wonder I could use another week.

834
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,880
We went three weeks late already.

835
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,060
I hope he likes it. Tim.

836
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,890
Rolling.

837
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,430
I'd be crazy about it if he
hasn't gone out and bought

838
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,940
himself another show
while he's been waiting.

839
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,550
Good morning.

840
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,210
Sally. What are you doing up?

841
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,210
I'm gonna have my breakfast, right?

842
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,270
It is in morning already. No, it can't be.

843
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,370
Sally, you'll be late for school.

844
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,570
I'm coming.

845
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,000
Say Jim,

846
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,070
don't you think I better call
Roman's secretary and get an

847
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,470
appointment? You better call him at home.

848
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,420
It's a little early.

849
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,253
Morning.

850
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
Brian. 2 4, 4 6, please.

851
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,810
Do you think it's in good enough
condition for him to hear?

852
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:43,940
Oh yeah. Sure.

853
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,120
It's in good shape. For first draft.

854
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,680
Hello. This is Kern.

855
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,130
Jerry Kern.

856
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,130
Mr. Fryman was expecting me to
call today about an appoint.

857
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,420
He, he's leaving for England.

858
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,050
Well, but he promised that he
was gonna listen to my show.

859
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,310
Oh boy. For his next
per deck saying today.

860
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,540
Oh, alright.

861
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,373
Thanks.

862
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,370
Well, that's it.

863
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:16,040
He's going over to buy
himself another English show.

864
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,710
Well, he can't.

865
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,090
No. No, he can't.

866
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,630
We worked like dogs on this score.

867
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,890
Jim and I had all my plans
made too. After he bought it.

868
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,870
I was gonna jump the
next boat for England.

869
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:28,800
I'd forgotten about that young lady.

870
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,467
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.

871
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,190
My passport is still good.

872
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:37,350
Why don't I take the same boat
he's taking today? Wonderful.

873
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:39,250
Get him on board ship. But
he can't get away from ya.

874
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,640
That's right. Then I
can sell him the show.

875
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,760
Wonderful.

876
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,370
Then I can go and see Eva. Sure.

877
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:44,720
Sure. You can get married.

878
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,650
Well, yeah.

879
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,690
Probably have to ask her
first. Well that, well, I,

880
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,360
I'll go and find the
steamship company. Right.

881
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,443
I'll go back.

882
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:53,770
Why you think you'd make it.

883
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:54,110
All right?

884
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:56,750
If we get a break in traffic
and the old engine holds up.

885
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:56,970
Oh.

886
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:57,970
Uncle Jerry.

887
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,290
Jerry, come on now.

888
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,020
We've only got a few minutes.

889
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:03,430
Jerry.

890
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,680
You wanna miss that boat? Come on here.

891
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,593
Child's falling.

892
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:22,970
It's like watching an era
crumble in front of him.

893
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:26,220
The theater's gonna miss him.

894
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,053
Yeah.

895
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,950
You were very lucky to
miss that boat. Jerry.

896
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,700
Seen Max around. Oh, hello?

897
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,540
Jim. Victor.

898
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:36,760
No.

899
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,470
I think he went over to
com. Stuck in Elliot's.

900
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,470
What a terrible tragedy. Yes.

901
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,600
Yeah, that's unbelievable.

902
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,860
Jerry and I were just talking. Oh, Jerry,

903
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:45,150
you know Victor Herbert, don't you?

904
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,460
This is Jerry Kern Victor.

905
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,510
How do you do, Jerry?

906
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,840
It's a great honor to meet you, Mr.

907
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,280
Herbert.

908
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,700
Charlie Furman spoke of you quite often.

909
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,830
He had great hopes for you.

910
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,780
Well, he was very kind.

911
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,420
He liked you, but more
important, he respected you.

912
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,610
And it's easy to see why
you've got a song to sing.

913
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:04,200
Thank you, Mr.

914
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,510
Heaven.

915
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:08,150
Look down at that city, Jerry.

916
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,140
It's made up of millions of people.

917
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:14,430
The music is played a
part in all our lives.

918
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:19,430
Lullabies, love songs, hymns, anthems.

919
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,240
Must be pretty wonderful, Mr.

920
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:23,680
Herbert,

921
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,040
to realize that people you
don't even know and never will

922
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,520
know are singing your songs
and all of them asking for more

923
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,860
of the Victor Herbert music.

924
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:36,027
It makes me feel grateful,
Jerry, and very humble.

925
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:40,470
One of these days, you'll find
out yourself how it feels.

926
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,000
What is it?

927
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,750
My publishers call me the
Dean of American Music.

928
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,940
Well, I think you are
going to be the next dean.

929
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:53,110
One thing I must admit you've
got a better figure for it.

930
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,810
Keep riding, boy.

931
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:57,100
Don't let anything stop you.

932
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,540
Good night.

933
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,790
Good night, Mr.

934
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,620
Night. Victor, Jim.

935
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,953
Good night, Jim.

936
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,170
Good evening. Mr.

937
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:08,060
Ha.

938
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,390
It's a deal. Gentlemen, congratulations.

939
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:12,850
Comstock and Elliot are
going to produce. Oh boy.

940
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,930
Max just sent me over with a check.

941
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:16,350
What's.

942
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,140
The matter? Aren't you for us happy?

943
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,800
Yeah, thanks.

944
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,597
Turn out those lights again, will you?

945
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,960
Well, there it is in lights.

946
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,120
How does it feel? Well,
it feels pretty good.

947
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,300
If I could just get rid of
some of these butterflies in my

948
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,240
stomach.

949
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,490
How do you feel? Well,

950
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:52,780
I've got a little butterfly
trouble myself, I suppose.

951
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:56,600
You think we're standing in
front of a theater on 39 from

952
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,020
No. What do you take me for?

953
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,360
This isn't 39th and Broadway.
This is the top of the world.

954
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,730
Pretty nice world, isn't it?

955
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,850
Yeah, it's great.

956
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,020
It's wonderful. What a difference.

957
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,500
Seeing your name and lights
can make isn't come on.

958
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,333
We better go in. We miss the show.

959
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,630
The red comes a better,

960
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:24,990
and I'd like to be safe in bed

961
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,510
while the world is trouble

962
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,500
to remain and

963
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,087
for a clearer.

964
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:34,693
And

965
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,840
are we big?

966
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,930
Well, this is it, Jerry, you're in my boy.

967
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,420
Listen to that applause. It's for you.

968
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:49,003
Don't wake me up. Don't
anybody wake me up,

969
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,360
figured out how you're
gonna spend your money yet.

970
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,370
Well, for one thing,

971
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:03,170
I think I'll buy an interest
in harms for another.

972
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:07,400
I think you might take
a little ocean voyage.

973
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,890
Well, good luck.

974
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,750
I don't see how she can
possibly say no. Well,

975
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,710
that's what I'm worried about.

976
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,570
I'm afraid she is going
to say no, Jim, you know,

977
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,860
I can't get her out of my mind.

978
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:22,280
She's well, she's, yeah, I know.

979
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,180
I've been through this before.

980
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:28,700
She's everything you've ever
dreamed of on this earth.

981
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,700
She's everything I've
ever dreamed of in heaven.

982
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,240
Well, Jerry, let's stop here, shall we?

983
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,073
Alright,

984
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,390
Jerry. Hmm.

985
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:02,160
You know, you did write very often.

986
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,050
Well, my letters weren't
very interesting, Eva,

987
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,990
so I told them up.

988
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:08,330
As a matter of fact, you didn't
write very often yourself.

989
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,250
A lady doesn't correspond with
the gentleman unless it's a

990
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,910
reason other than a personal one.

991
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:15,140
Oh, well, now doesn't it
sound a little silly to you?

992
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:15,360
No.

993
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,780
It, it sounds altogether
fitting and proper.

994
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,170
Oh.

995
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,200
Wanna fight?

996
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,430
A lady doesn't fight.

997
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,700
Well, what does a lady do?

998
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:22,920
Oh.

999
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,070
You are impossible.

1000
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,780
Well, you're right.

1001
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,500
If I were you, I'd have
nothing to do with me.

1002
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,660
In fact, if I were you when
I asked you to marry me,

1003
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,980
I'd say no. Just on the grounds
that a lady never says yes.

1004
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:34,200
Now.

1005
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,680
See here, are you going
to ask me to marry?

1006
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,330
You.

1007
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,960
Might. With a little encouragement.

1008
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,060
A lady doesn't in my country.
If a lady wants to be asked,

1009
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,860
she has to be encouraging. In my country.

1010
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,600
In your country, what?

1011
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:43,800
In your.

1012
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,490
Country. Well, there are,

1013
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,400
there are proper ways to go
about such things in every

1014
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,400
country. Oh.

1015
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:50,790
Well then, let me put it this way.

1016
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,440
From the very first moment I
saw you when you walked in from

1017
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,460
the garden, I knew that out
of all the women in the world,

1018
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,060
I'd finally found the right one.

1019
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,560
The only one I wanted to tell you.

1020
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,440
Then I wanted to say hello. Funny face.

1021
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,700
I don't know your name
or anything about you,

1022
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,460
but I've loved you all my life.

1023
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,360
You were my first school
teacher. My first date,

1024
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:12,240
the first girl I ever kissed
and everything in the world to

1025
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,060
me.

1026
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,140
You see, I recognized you immediately.

1027
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,420
You thought all that.

1028
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,800
That's right.

1029
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,760
I stood there thinking that.

1030
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,430
Wondering what you'd do if I kissed you.

1031
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:23,190
What would you have done?

1032
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:25,107
What would you do? Now,

1033
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,370
will you marry me?

1034
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:34,860
Thank you so much.

1035
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,860
I'd love to.

1036
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,210
Hello, Mrs.

1037
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,627
Hello my darling.

1038
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:45,960
They're.

1039
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,190
Here. Daddy, they're coming up the stairs.

1040
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,040
Welcome home, Jim.

1041
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,590
What you old. You really did at this time.

1042
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:57,840
Nothing my boy. Nothing.

1043
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,420
Just a little gesture.

1044
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,253
Jim.

1045
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:05,593
This is even.

1046
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,570
Hello, Eva.

1047
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,403
Hello.

1048
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,830
Well, you've married the
nicest guy in this world,

1049
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:16,170
but the craziest, oh, now wait a minute.

1050
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,820
I was keeping that from her.

1051
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,010
Isn't she sensational? Jim, Jerry, honey,

1052
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,400
turn around and let him
look at you. Oh, Jerry,

1053
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,120
look at that hair on those eyes.

1054
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,160
Have you ever seen a woman
like that in your life before?

1055
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,630
Only once.

1056
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:32,130
No. I I hope that both of you
have all the happiness in this

1057
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:33,130
world. Oh, thank you.

1058
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:33,530
Thank you.

1059
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,710
Jim. I think we have already, but getting.

1060
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:37,710
Me and the music.

1061
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,690
Oh, Sally, yes.

1062
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,250
I, I'm sorry.

1063
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,050
Dear I Sally.

1064
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:47,297
On behalf of my father,
Jim Hessler, myself,

1065
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:52,610
on behalf of my father,
Jim Hessler and myself,

1066
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:56,050
I wish to congratulate you on
the start of your voice into

1067
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,470
the great sea of life.

1068
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:58,303
Oh, Sally.

1069
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,050
Well, on behalf of my wife and myself,

1070
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,720
I thank you very much.

1071
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,140
Okay.

1072
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:04,900
Hello, Mrs.

1073
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,250
Hello.

1074
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:05,810
Mr. Curry.

1075
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:05,960
Sally.

1076
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,950
It's so wonderful to see you.

1077
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:10,690
Why you have grown up, haven't you?

1078
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,140
Sally? This is your aunt Eva.

1079
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,290
On behalf of my father. Thank you, Sally.

1080
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:17,820
We're going to be real
good friends, aren't we?

1081
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,150
Yes. I expect we are.

1082
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,160
Well, what do you say?

1083
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,860
Let's, let's all go in and have
something to eat, shall we?

1084
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,540
Oh, Jim, it's so good to be home again.

1085
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:29,160
Yes, it was good to be home.

1086
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,340
I felt I had everything in
the world, happiness, success,

1087
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,840
and the wife I had dreamed about.

1088
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,760
I wanted to put it all into music.

1089
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:43,760
Eva's smile and her eyes and
what it meant to be with her.

1090
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:49,850
And at last, it seemed to me
that the clouds had rolled by.

1091
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,683
First there was, leave it to Jane.

1092
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:58,160
Leave it to Jane. Jane.

1093
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,340
I don't dunno why you should
make me pot plan for you.

1094
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,480
She is a girl with.

1095
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,300
I always try to do everything
I can for you. No problem.

1096
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,800
You can wish on her gifts for.

1097
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,880
She'll tackle ga.

1098
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,940
A score or more daily.

1099
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:13,160
If.

1100
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,930
Something is on your.

1101
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,390
Heart, and I can see that
there is not a dot of it.

1102
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:18,260
Comfort.

1103
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,900
You soon.

1104
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,100
It to me. I'll soon get you out of it if.

1105
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:22,933
You,

1106
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,200
and just hand over the
whole thing to Jane.

1107
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,580
Well, Jane, why don't you
tell us how you do it?

1108
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,600
Yes. Come on, Jane.

1109
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,660
Tell.

1110
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,560
Oh. But it's really very simple.

1111
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,020
I just study up on the
famous women of history.

1112
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,750
You mean like Lucrecia Borja?

1113
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,260
Well.

1114
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:53,620
No, not exactly.

1115
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:54,820
Listen.

1116
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:58,600
In days of old beside
the Nile of famous queen,

1117
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,460
there dwells her clothes.
Were you but full of style.

1118
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,460
Her figures slim. And on
every man that wandered by,

1119
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:12,200
she pulled the theater bearer out.

1120
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:17,900
And everyone observed with
awe that her work was sw,

1121
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,480
but never wrong.

1122
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,600
I be likely your, if I could
have my way, each man she met,

1123
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,280
she went and kissed, and
she dozens on her list.

1124
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:39,280
I wish that I had lived there
beside the pyramid for a girl

1125
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,840
who did, or

1126
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:56,210
she danced new dances now and
then the sword that make you

1127
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,150
blood.

1128
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:58,880
Each time she did them,

1129
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,540
scores of men got injured in the rush.

1130
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:07,460
They'd stand there gaping in
a line and watch her agitate

1131
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,293
her spine.

1132
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:14,700
It simply used to knock them
flat when she went like this.

1133
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:20,300
And then like that cat dancing, Clee.

1134
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:25,980
Oh, patter was always on the spot.

1135
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,230
She gave those four. Egyptian
gained something else

1136
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,433
that what first made him.

1137
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,453
The

1138
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:09,037
something is on your mind.

1139
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:14,320
We'll find if you have

1140
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,813
Father.

1141
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,700
Once again, Broadway
belonged to the Americans,

1142
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:48,540
to George Kohan, Irv Berlin.

1143
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,440
George Gershwin, Vincent, buddy DeSilva.

1144
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,220
I was working in mighty great company.

1145
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,240
And in one of my own shows, Sally,

1146
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,160
I was fortunate enough to
have the reigning queen of the

1147
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:08,160
era, the wistful, lovely
unforgettable, Marilyn Miller.

1148
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:28,880
Alright, Larry.

1149
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,760
Thank you, Hazel.

1150
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,450
My, we're gonna have to hurry.

1151
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,700
How's it going?

1152
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,540
I was never so nervous.

1153
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,820
See more flowers?

1154
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,820
Mr. Fel Lovely says the first
act was a dream sign flow.

1155
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:45,970
Well, she said the second act.

1156
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:50,970
Don't worry about the second.
Act second better than first

1157
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,120
Q. Hazel is everything
ready for the quick change?

1158
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,287
Everything's ready in the
stage dressing room. All

1159
01:16:58,850 --> 01:16:59,683
Thank you.

1160
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,800
We got everything? Yes.

1161
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,860
Everything's here.

1162
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,270
Go.

1163
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,170
Good luck Ms. Miller.

1164
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,003
Thank you.

1165
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:18,520
Keep.

1166
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,460
It up. Keep your fingers crossed.

1167
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:20,740
You.

1168
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,573
Bet.

1169
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:26,657
Oh, here, you, everything is ready.

1170
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,820
I got a nice and warm.

1171
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:34,320
Put it right here.

1172
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:53,540
As I wash my dishes,

1173
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:58,540
I'll be following a plan
till I see the brightness in

1174
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,190
every pot and pan.

1175
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,790
I'm sure this point of
view will ease the daily

1176
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:17,670
I in my mind,

1177
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:31,250
the silver line when

1178
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:47,830
somewhere the sun is shining.

1179
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,670
And so the

1180
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,990
shine for you

1181
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:09,670
of joy and glad

1182
01:19:17,810 --> 01:19:18,643
and

1183
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:28,740
look for silver lining

1184
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:34,030
and try to find.

1185
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,340
I never thought I'd ever keep a scrapbook,

1186
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:12,340
but it was nice to know that
people were singing my songs

1187
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,490
and asking for more.

1188
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,580
Night boat. Good morning, dear.

1189
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:21,020
The zig fell follies, curtains
went up, curtains came down.

1190
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,060
But I think,

1191
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:26,143
and we got to look a little
more like a musician.

1192
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,900
Eva grew laier with every passing year.

1193
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:35,180
Our life was rich and
full and very satisfying.

1194
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:39,520
And Jim and I, well, we
grew a little grayer.

1195
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,460
More seven perhaps.

1196
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:46,220
He was still working on
his symphony, so he said,

1197
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,430
but on the whole, the years
didn't change as much.

1198
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:51,440
However, they certainly did change.

1199
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,420
Sally, she was quite a young lady.

1200
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:54,450
Now.

1201
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:56,380
She'd been away at school.

1202
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,213
In fact, many schools.

1203
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,210
Well, Sally.

1204
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:01,350
Hello.

1205
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,183
Darling.

1206
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,910
Well, Sally, I thought you were at school.

1207
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:08,860
Well, I, I was.

1208
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,920
Oh, what happened this time?

1209
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,390
I just can't stand that
school anymore. Uncle Jerry.

1210
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:17,350
I've left and, and I'm not going back.

1211
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,350
What does your father say about that?

1212
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:22,380
Well, he, he hasn't said anything yet.

1213
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:25,200
He, he doesn't exactly know you see,

1214
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,480
I just left there this morning
and I came right out here to

1215
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,480
talk to you.

1216
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,840
Oh, uncle Jerry.

1217
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,440
I had to leave. I hated it so much.

1218
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:35,440
I couldn't eat or sleep or anything.

1219
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:40,140
This is the third school you've
left now, isn't it, Sally?

1220
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:40,670
Yes.

1221
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,320
Well, no,

1222
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,540
it seems to me that you ought
to be able to make a go.

1223
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:44,660
One of them.

1224
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,180
Oh, I just don't seem to fit in very well.

1225
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:49,780
The kids all seem so, oh, I don't know.

1226
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:53,150
All they're interested in
are parties and clothes.

1227
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:56,740
They seem to think that's
all there is to life.

1228
01:22:56,740 --> 01:23:00,090
Oh, uncle Jerry, I I wish
you'd talked to dad for me.

1229
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:02,340
He'll, he'll listen to you.

1230
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,830
Well, Sally, you know
your father isn't well.

1231
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:08,300
Then I ought to be home
where I can take care of him.

1232
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,260
You ought to be at school
completing your education.

1233
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:13,620
You want to make something
of your life, don't you?

1234
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,620
Oh, I've had an education and,

1235
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:18,860
and now I wanna get down
to something serious.

1236
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,080
Oh.

1237
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,140
Uncle Jerry,

1238
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,060
you did promise you'd help me
get a start in the theater.

1239
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:23,280
Ah.

1240
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:27,870
Ah, ah, I said I'd help
you when you were ready.

1241
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:30,360
Your father wants you to
complete your schooling first,

1242
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,850
Sally, and he's the boss.

1243
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:36,120
Jerry Dad's forgotten what
it's like to be young and feel

1244
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,460
like this. But you haven't,

1245
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:41,360
you haven't forgotten what
it's like to stand on Broadway

1246
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,230
and look up at the light and think.

1247
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:44,870
Someday.

1248
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:47,860
I'll see my name up there.

1249
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:51,680
You remember that feeling,
don't you Uncle Jerry?

1250
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,250
Yes, Sally.

1251
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:53,970
I've got to admit it. I do.

1252
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:57,200
Well, well then that's more
important than school or,

1253
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,990
or anything else in the world, isn't it?

1254
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:02,740
Isn't it Uncle Jerry?

1255
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:15,460
It's the third time Jerry.

1256
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,460
Yes. I know.

1257
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:21,530
Maybe we shouldn't have
made her go back before,

1258
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:24,220
after all if she hates
it so much. Oh, Jerry,

1259
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,950
you can't keep on running
away from things all your life

1260
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:30,110
time. Sally found that out.

1261
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:33,540
Well, you can't live another
person's life for them either.

1262
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:34,790
Jim isn't fair.

1263
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,520
Sally's grown up now and I
think she ought to be allowed to

1264
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,000
do what she wants to do.

1265
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,120
I want her to finish her
education and get a chance to

1266
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,360
finish mine.

1267
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,220
I, I always said that any
kid of mine was going to,

1268
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:52,190
to get the right start in life.

1269
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:52,480
Well,

1270
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,900
what's right for one person
isn't always right for another

1271
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,520
Jim. You know that Jerry,

1272
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:03,420
the trouble with that girl is
she's just plain stage struck.

1273
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,040
She comes by that, honestly enough.

1274
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,040
Doesn't she?

1275
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,640
Remember how we used to pound
the sidewalks and knock on

1276
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,520
doors? Nobody could stop us.

1277
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,730
Goodness. Only knows enough people.

1278
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:20,000
Tried to remember how thrilled
we were when we finally

1279
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,100
realized we were in.

1280
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:22,800
So what? Right.

1281
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,150
Have you or I to interfere with Sally?

1282
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:26,983
Yeah.

1283
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:32,880
Well, what, what are we gonna do, Jerry?

1284
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,860
I give her a pound. And Sonny,

1285
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:40,860
That's so cast Father Gwen
hasn't been cast yet, Gwen.

1286
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,910
Well, that's, it's only one line.

1287
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:48,060
Gwen is going to have a song.

1288
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,020
The doctor's here. Mr.

1289
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,910
Hes Oh. Oh, finally, doctor,

1290
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:54,440
I'll be with you upstairs in
just a minute. Good evening,

1291
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:54,890
Mr. Carter.

1292
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:56,057
Hello, doctor.

1293
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:01,260
You know when you, you get to be my age,

1294
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:06,260
you start collecting pills about

1295
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:14,493
Jerry. I hope that works out alright.

1296
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,253
Who.

1297
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:30,780
Stole my heart away?

1298
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:31,613
Who.

1299
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:38,000
Makes me dream all day? Dreams
I know can never be true.

1300
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,550
Seems as though.

1301
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:43,050
I'll ever be blue.

1302
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:46,640
Hello, Mr.

1303
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,870
Hammerstein. How are you?

1304
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,520
Very well, Ms.

1305
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,040
Miller. And you?

1306
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,000
Fine. Hello, Oscar.

1307
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,833
Jerry.

1308
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,880
This is a charming number.

1309
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,670
I was just telling Jerry
how much I liked it.

1310
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:57,580
What a fine lyric you've written. Oh.

1311
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:02,310
Thanks Jerry.

1312
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:03,450
I've just been talking to Mr.

1313
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:06,960
Dillingham and he thinks that
who should be a big production

1314
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,580
number instead of a solo.

1315
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,247
And that, of course,
Merril ought to ing it.

1316
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:17,000
Oh, well then of course
we'll have to do it.

1317
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:21,210
It puts me in rather a tough
position though, Oscar,

1318
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:24,560
after all, I did write it for Sally.

1319
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,510
I know you did Jerry, but we'll
give Sally something else.

1320
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,150
Well, she's gonna be awfully disappointed.

1321
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:33,340
It's a wonderful song
and I'd love to sing it,

1322
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:36,870
but I hate to take it away from her.

1323
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:41,120
Well, it's for the good
of the show, Marilyn.

1324
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,510
I think you're right. Oscar.

1325
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:46,800
Have you thought though how
you're gonna tell Sally it's not

1326
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,740
gonna be easy? Oh, I thought
you should tell her, Jerry.

1327
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:51,750
Oh, I was afraid you would.

1328
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,500
Well, after all you know her so well.

1329
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,200
It shouldn't be too difficult. Well,

1330
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,700
it would be a lot easier if
I didn't know her so well.

1331
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:03,260
Would you like me to tell her?

1332
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,730
I'm sure she'll understand.

1333
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:05,320
Would you do.

1334
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:05,670
That, Marilyn?

1335
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:06,280
Certainly.

1336
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,650
Ask her to meet me in my
dressing room and don't worry.

1337
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,820
Thank you, darling.

1338
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:15,140
But Uncle Jerry wrote
that song for me. I know,

1339
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:19,380
and I know how disappointed
you must be too.

1340
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,380
But Sally Disappointments
are part of the theater,

1341
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,320
and you've got to be able to
take them for the very same

1342
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,400
thing happened to me in my first show.

1343
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,600
I had to give up my song with a star.

1344
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,230
I think I felt pretty much
as your feeling right now.

1345
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:34,080
Then I think it's a pretty
low miserable trick for you to

1346
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,830
pull on someone else.

1347
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:42,380
Sally, listen to me a minute.

1348
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,010
This is your first show.

1349
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:46,990
You're just starting and
there are gonna be a good many

1350
01:28:46,990 --> 01:28:49,490
songs and a good many shows for you.

1351
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,490
It may be difficult for
you to understand now,

1352
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:54,500
but one day you'll realize
you've got to give and take

1353
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,740
whether you like it or not.

1354
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,590
I'll never take a song
away from anyone else,

1355
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:01,520
especially if it's
their first real chance.

1356
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,960
Sally, please don't put
this on a personal basis.

1357
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,710
I don't wanna take the song away from you.

1358
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:07,540
Then why are you doing it?

1359
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,820
Mr. Dillingham thinks
it's best for the show.

1360
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,120
And what's best for the show
is more important than what I

1361
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:15,370
want or you want or any
personal feelings involved.

1362
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:16,580
Don't you see that, Sally?

1363
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,240
Yes, I see it.

1364
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:17,700
All right.

1365
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,160
You're trying to take my song
away from me and you aren't

1366
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,050
going to get away with it.

1367
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:22,720
Uncle Jerry wrote that song for me,

1368
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,840
and I'm going to sing it.

1369
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,120
I don't care whether you are the star.

1370
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,140
You're not gonna take
it away from me, Sally.

1371
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:29,880
You can't have my song Uncle Jerry.

1372
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,680
Don't let her talk you into it.

1373
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,847
I don't care what happens.
She can't have my song.

1374
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:44,790
I am sorry, Jerry.

1375
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,330
What is it, Sally?

1376
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,860
Am I still in the show? Uncle Jerry.

1377
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:04,560
If you want to be, you
won't have a song though.

1378
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,640
I took my song away from me.
The song you wrote for me.

1379
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:13,570
Sally, there's a little thing
called the Good of the Show.

1380
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,570
Apparently the show didn't
seem very important to you this

1381
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:16,403
afternoon.

1382
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,570
What important?

1383
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,850
You didn't care what happened
to the show just so long as

1384
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:23,267
you got your way.

1385
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:27,130
The theater doesn't work that way, Sally.

1386
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,047
Nothing works that way.

1387
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:32,460
I learned something today.

1388
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,160
I suddenly realized that you
are not ready for the theater

1389
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,680
yet.

1390
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,000
But.

1391
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,833
Not ready.

1392
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,750
Who all you have to
offer is a small talent,

1393
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:47,667
great deal of conceit in return
for which you want success.

1394
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:58,173
Sally,

1395
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,740
I've known you and loved you
ever since you were a little

1396
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,573
girl.

1397
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:08,480
I couldn't love you anymore
if you were my own child.

1398
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,520
But I must say this to you,

1399
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,800
you're not gonna get anywhere
in this life by using people.

1400
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,560
And until you realize that,

1401
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,143
you're not gonna add
the respect of anyone.

1402
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,540
Sally, I I'm.

1403
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:59,793
Back into my memory side.

1404
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:34,573
The.

1405
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:26,780
My heart away makes me dream more day.

1406
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:30,240
Dreams I know can never come true.

1407
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:34,240
Seems as though I'll ever be. Boo

1408
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,840
means my happiness.

1409
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:46,080
Would I answer yes to where you ought

1410
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:50,073
no one, but you.

1411
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:57,773
The one.

1412
01:36:52,510 --> 01:36:53,343
Hello?

1413
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,690
Yes. Hezbollah.

1414
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:02,203
And you send for the doctor.

1415
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,490
Is Sally there?

1416
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,180
Oh, well, you be sure he stays in bed, Ms.

1417
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:11,763
Muller, and I'll be right over.

1418
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:22,910
Dogs get here. He's upstairs in Mr.

1419
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:23,993
Haslers room.

1420
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,280
It is his heart.

1421
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,440
I wouldn't stay very long. Mr.

1422
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,107
Hessler could use a little rest.

1423
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:47,780
Well, good evening, Jim.

1424
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:51,780
Oh, Jerry, we missed you
at the theater tonight.

1425
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:53,620
How are you?

1426
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,467
Sally's gone. Jerry.

1427
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:00,740
Yes, I know.

1428
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,157
Mrs. Mul told me.

1429
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,080
I she didn't come down for dinner, so.

1430
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,320
Went.

1431
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,403
Up to a room.

1432
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:17,930
Dear Daddy, I'm going out on my own.

1433
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:21,550
Don't worry about me. Someday
you'll be proud of me.

1434
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:23,910
I'll always love you dear.

1435
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:26,743
Tell Uncle Jerry I still love him.

1436
01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:31,120
That's all my fault. Jim.

1437
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,340
I shouldn't have suggested
that she'd be in the show. No,

1438
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:34,930
no, no.

1439
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:36,630
Jerry. Sally is Sally.

1440
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:38,740
It's time. Both of us face that.

1441
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:42,230
Yes, I know, but I think I heard her.

1442
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:42,730
Well.

1443
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:44,063
She's got Spunk.

1444
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:47,420
Jerry. She's young.

1445
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:50,640
She's, she's way too young
to be out on her own.

1446
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,080
Well, now look, Jim, don't
you worry about this.

1447
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:54,570
I'll bring her back.

1448
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:56,560
I wish you'd do that. I promise you.

1449
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,280
I'll try my most.

1450
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,920
Yeah, just as soon as you can.

1451
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,753
Yeah.

1452
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,090
Goodnight. Jim.

1453
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:11,503
Why don't you get back in the
bed and get some rest. Yeah.

1454
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:17,810
I left no stone unturned trying
to find Sally personal ads,

1455
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,423
private detectives.

1456
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:22,870
But the answer was always the same.

1457
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:24,710
No one had seen her.

1458
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:26,460
It was a futile hunt.

1459
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:33,490
I tried to keep Jim's hopes
alive, but I think he knew.

1460
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:39,330
And then one night,

1461
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,927
please don't mention the right telephone.

1462
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:52,160
I think Mr. Curry, you'd
better go up right away.

1463
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,243
He's been asking for you.

1464
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:26,493
Jim.

1465
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,760
I I was just driving by.

1466
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,410
I thought I'd drop in and say hello.

1467
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,243
Yeah.

1468
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,850
You forget I've known you a long time.

1469
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:45,340
Feeling.

1470
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,923
Better, aren't you?

1471
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:48,603
Yeah.

1472
01:40:49,570 --> 01:40:50,403
Yeah. I'm.

1473
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:55,183
Good. All you need now is a little rest.

1474
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:00,990
Kinda quiet around here now.

1475
01:41:00,990 --> 01:41:01,920
Yeah, seriously.

1476
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,300
It is.

1477
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:05,800
But things will be popping again
just as soon as Sally comes

1478
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,633
back.

1479
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,690
Have you heard from a jury?

1480
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:12,530
No. No.

1481
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:15,860
Not directly, but I've got
a couple of very good leads.

1482
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:19,443
I've got a hunt that
won't be very long now

1483
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,100
then I'm gonna see the one thing, Mr.

1484
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,910
Hela, you are going to
finish that symphony.

1485
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:28,250
I've kept you from that too long now.

1486
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,490
Oh, I forgot about that symphony.

1487
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:33,620
Forgot, forgot about it years ago.

1488
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,160
What about your notes?

1489
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,830
I never made any notes.

1490
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:42,230
I was just pausing as usual.

1491
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,527
You know, I used to,

1492
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,220
I used to go around hollering
about being a genius.

1493
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,580
You are a genius, Jim.

1494
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:56,840
And you with your wheezed little tunes,

1495
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:01,853
you are writing the real music.

1496
01:42:03,390 --> 01:42:04,223
The.

1497
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:07,757
The Folk Music of America.

1498
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:14,590
Thanks Jerry for letting
me kind of stick around.

1499
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:15,260
No, wait a minute.

1500
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:17,530
Let's get something straight. Jim,

1501
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:21,890
I didn't let you hang around
if it hadn't been for you.

1502
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:24,870
When your faith in me, I
would've quit half a dozen times.

1503
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,037
You know that.

1504
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:27,983
And.

1505
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:32,720
If we're gonna start handing out bouquets,

1506
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:35,040
I just want you to know that
I don't know where to begin to

1507
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:35,873
Thank you.

1508
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,767
You're a great man, Jerry.

1509
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:52,167
It's been a privilege
getting in on that music.

1510
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:57,260
It's been a lot of fun.

1511
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,800
Now, let's not talk that way, Jim.

1512
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,080
A couple of weeks you'll be
back at that piano screaming for

1513
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,747
more and more brass.

1514
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:11,410
Jerry, this looks like time for strings.

1515
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:19,640
Jerry, if I,

1516
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:27,503
I want you to look after s for me.

1517
01:43:28,930 --> 01:43:30,810
Jim, you are going to be All right.

1518
01:43:30,810 --> 01:43:35,030
So is Sally in a couple of
weeks where we'll be laughing

1519
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,947
about this.

1520
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,750
Is it better perhaps
if I made some coffee?

1521
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:41,903
Oh, no.

1522
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,960
No. It can't be.

1523
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,627
Mr. Kern had hardly
closed the door when he,

1524
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:05,910
I was completely lost,
completely helpless.

1525
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:13,120
Jim was gone and I had failed
him. Was still failing him.

1526
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:16,900
I'd lost a world with Jim's passing.

1527
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:20,640
And everywhere I walked,
I walked with ghosts,

1528
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,040
reliving lost hours,

1529
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,570
pacing a world of memories I
couldn't even think in terms of

1530
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:27,403
music.

1531
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,280
I began to feel that I
might never write again.

1532
01:45:40,370 --> 01:45:42,210
How long has this been going on.

1533
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:43,627
For? Weeks Oscar?

1534
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:48,850
Ever since Jim died, he's
a scorer to write me.

1535
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:51,260
Has he done one song?

1536
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,270
That certainly doesn't
sound like Jerry. He.

1537
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:55,780
Seems to have completely lost heart.

1538
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:57,850
Have you had any word of Sally?

1539
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:00,910
No, but he has every friend
he ever had in show business

1540
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:02,060
looking.

1541
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,130
Well, don't worry about it.

1542
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:05,380
You'll turn up.

1543
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:11,740
It's Jerry. I'm worried
most about, you know, Oscar.

1544
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,530
I believe he's beginning to think. He,

1545
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:16,180
he can't write music anymore.

1546
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:19,060
It's heartbreaking to watch him.

1547
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:23,460
Well, I, I have a book here
I'd like him to take a look at.

1548
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:25,690
I've been commissioned to
adapt it and write the lyrics.

1549
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:29,270
And I think Jerry's a man do the music.

1550
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:31,260
I don't think he'll do it, Oscar.

1551
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,300
Well, that's hard to believe.

1552
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,750
There's never been a time as
long as I've known Jerry when

1553
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:38,010
you couldn't excite him with a good story.

1554
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:42,010
There's never been a time
in his life like this.

1555
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,667
But I'll, but you can try and
I'll tell him you're here.

1556
01:46:54,610 --> 01:46:55,443
Hello.

1557
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,110
How's it going, dear?

1558
01:46:59,110 --> 01:47:00,240
Oh fine, darling.

1559
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,130
Fine.

1560
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:02,910
I was just tinkering a
little bit with a melody,

1561
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:05,070
but it's going to be all. Of course it is.

1562
01:47:05,070 --> 01:47:07,860
Hi. It is raining, isn't it Jerry?

1563
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:10,630
Oscar Hammerstein's here. Oscar.

1564
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:13,213
Oh God. Why didn't you tell me?

1565
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,070
Oscar, come in.

1566
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:17,810
Oh, Jerry, this is good to see you.

1567
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:19,230
Watch you sit down.

1568
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,520
Sit down. Thanks, Jerry.

1569
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,200
Well, what's, what's new?

1570
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,050
I'll tell you what brought
me out here, Jerry.

1571
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:26,330
I came across a novel that I
think is gonna make a great

1572
01:47:26,330 --> 01:47:27,270
show.

1573
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,300
Now, if you do the music,
I'd like to do the book.

1574
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,290
Oscar. I, I'd love to.

1575
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:32,950
I really would.

1576
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:37,290
But I have so many commitments
right now that I don't think

1577
01:47:37,290 --> 01:47:39,970
it, I wouldn't be fair to
you or anyone concerned.

1578
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,650
Suppose I leave the book with
you when you glance through it

1579
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:42,870
when you have time.

1580
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:44,240
Oh, it's no use Oscar.

1581
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,270
Well, I'll leave it anyhow.

1582
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:48,130
See you next week. Won't
you stay for dinner?

1583
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:50,270
I certainly like to, but I
have to get back to town.

1584
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:52,430
Bye Eve. I'll see you to the door, Oscar.

1585
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:53,263
Bye bye.

1586
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:16,043
I get it.

1587
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:20,020
Hello, this is Mrs.

1588
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:20,853
Curry.

1589
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:22,840
Oh.

1590
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:23,610
Just a moment. Mr.

1591
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:24,560
Kelly. Jerry.

1592
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,060
It's Arthur Kelly. He's got news of Sally.

1593
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:32,280
Hello Arthur.

1594
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,113
Yeah.

1595
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,430
Oh, that's wonderful.

1596
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:38,360
In Memphis.

1597
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,280
What was the name of that club again?

1598
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,750
Club Elite. All this week?

1599
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:44,220
Yes. Well, I get right on.

1600
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,887
Thank you very much.

1601
01:48:48,650 --> 01:48:51,270
Sally is singing at the Club
Elite in Memphis all this week.

1602
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:52,420
Oh, that's wonderful.

1603
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:57,170
Shall I pack a bag for you?
Yes, you do that now call me.

1604
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:42,043
One.

1605
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:55,520
One more night if you'll one more flight.

1606
01:49:56,620 --> 01:50:00,160
One more one.

1607
01:50:13,590 --> 01:50:13,880
Will.

1608
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,020
You dance with me?

1609
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:15,560
Oh, no.

1610
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:17,400
Thank you. No, go ahead
and dance with that.

1611
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:18,350
Charlie.

1612
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:19,183
Charlie.

1613
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,280
Will.

1614
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,640
You dance with me?

1615
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,790
I sure will. Baby.

1616
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,623
What this.

1617
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:59,120
Think of what you are losing
by constantly refusing to dance

1618
01:50:59,120 --> 01:50:59,953
with me.

1619
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:04,140
You'd be the idol of brands with me,

1620
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:10,070
and yet you stand there
and shake your foolish head

1621
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:14,710
dramatically while I wait here.

1622
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:19,710
So ecstatically, you just look and say,

1623
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:22,933
empha.

1624
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:25,250
Not this season.

1625
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:31,130
There's a reason I won't
dance. Don't ask me.

1626
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:33,410
I won't dance. Don't ask me.

1627
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:34,740
I won't dance.

1628
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,670
Madam am with you.

1629
01:51:36,670 --> 01:51:41,003
My heart won't let my feet
do things they should do.

1630
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:43,630
You know what?

1631
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:44,910
You are lovely.

1632
01:51:44,910 --> 01:51:46,110
So what?

1633
01:51:46,110 --> 01:51:47,070
I'm lovely.

1634
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:49,330
But what you do to me,

1635
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:54,970
I'm like an ocean wave
that's bumped on the shore.

1636
01:51:54,970 --> 01:51:58,470
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor.

1637
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:04,860
When you dance, your
charming and you're gentle,

1638
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,527
especially when you do the body.

1639
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:14,290
But this feeling isn't
purely mental for heaven.

1640
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:19,290
Resto, I'm not as best, and
that's why I won't dance.

1641
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:22,460
Why should I? I won't dance.

1642
01:52:22,460 --> 01:52:24,710
How could I, I won't dance.

1643
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,340
I know that musically
is the way to romance.

1644
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:34,160
So if I hold you in my arms, I.

1645
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:28,503
Come in.

1646
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:30,660
Sally.

1647
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,420
Oh, good, Jerry.

1648
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:35,830
Oh, good Jerry, I so glad to see you.

1649
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:37,310
What are you doing here?

1650
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:40,660
Well, I, I was up front watching the show.

1651
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:43,920
Did you see what we did
to your number. Yes.

1652
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,220
I bet you like the show.

1653
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:47,480
Not at all. As a matter
of fact, I liked it.

1654
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,760
I wish that some of the
people who think my music is

1655
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,200
highbrow could have seen it.

1656
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:53,360
I, I'm so excited.

1657
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,220
I I don't know what to do.

1658
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:57,030
You look wonderful. Uncle Jerry.

1659
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:58,890
More handsome than ever.

1660
01:54:58,890 --> 01:54:59,820
How's Aunt Eva?

1661
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:00,580
Oh, she's fine.

1662
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,740
But of course she misses you.

1663
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:05,760
Oh, I miss her too.

1664
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,780
I miss you both.

1665
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:08,440
Is she with you?

1666
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:10,860
You haven't told me yet
what you're doing here.

1667
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:13,220
No. Your Aunt Eva's in New York,

1668
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:16,830
and I'm here because somebody
told me I could find you here.

1669
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:19,390
I've been looking for you
for a long time now. Sally.

1670
01:55:19,390 --> 01:55:20,300
Welcome. Jerry.

1671
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:21,860
You shouldn't have
bothered. I'm all right.

1672
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:22,400
Oh, I'm.

1673
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:27,280
Sure you are. But I promised
your father I'd look after you.

1674
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,960
Sally, I want you to come
back to New York with me.

1675
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,240
I can't, uncle Jerry.

1676
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:34,800
I, I'd like to, but I can't.

1677
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:40,643
When I, when I heard about my father, I,

1678
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:47,360
I never realized he was so
ill Uncle Jerry. You know,

1679
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,540
I never would've lived him.

1680
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,790
Do I know that song.

1681
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:54,510
When I, when I heard
about him, it was as, oh,

1682
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:57,000
someone had forced me to look
into the mirror for the first

1683
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:57,833
time.

1684
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:06,320
I loved him very much, and
I knew I'd broken his heart.

1685
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:10,480
I was spoiled and selfish,
and I knew that I,

1686
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:14,240
I could never have any respect
for myself again unless I did

1687
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,740
what I said I was going to do.

1688
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:21,780
So, you see, I can't go back right now.

1689
01:56:21,780 --> 01:56:26,430
I'm making my own way now,
and I'm pretty good at it too.

1690
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:27,760
Well, Sally, I,

1691
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:32,390
I just don't like the idea of
you being here and all along.

1692
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:35,560
This is just a stepping stone
from where I've been to where

1693
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:36,977
I hope I'm going.

1694
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:42,240
I'm making $50 a week now
because management thinks I'm

1695
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,620
worth $50.

1696
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:46,060
If I'm worth more, I'll get more.

1697
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:50,060
And if not, I'll have to
find it out for myself.

1698
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:53,073
And Uncle Jerry.

1699
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:56,580
I'm not using anyone.

1700
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:00,410
Five.

1701
01:57:00,410 --> 01:57:01,540
Minutes.

1702
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:02,957
Thank you, Jimmy.

1703
01:57:04,630 --> 01:57:07,963
You understand. Don't you look at Jerry.

1704
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:12,530
Well, Sally, you know, darling,

1705
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:16,270
I'd give anything in the world
if you'd let me help you.

1706
01:57:16,270 --> 01:57:19,330
But I must say that I've never
been quite so proud of anyone

1707
01:57:19,330 --> 01:57:22,747
in my life as I am of you at this moment.

1708
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:30,570
Good.

1709
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:31,487
Luck, Alec.

1710
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:46,790
Gradually, I felt the old
heartache misting away,

1711
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:48,830
and I was at peace.

1712
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:52,570
The promise I had made,
Jim had been fulfilled.

1713
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:55,237
Sally was going to be all right.

1714
01:57:56,970 --> 01:58:01,010
I walked along the river that
night with a river wind in my

1715
01:58:01,010 --> 01:58:04,590
face and the taste of it on my lips.

1716
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:08,690
And I stood there listening

1717
01:58:11,170 --> 01:58:14,840
a sudden excitement thrilling through me,

1718
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:19,170
listening to the song of a
River that makes its way right

1719
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:22,030
through the heart of America.

1720
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:25,950
And the voice of that river
was the laughter, the tears,

1721
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:26,610
the joys,

1722
01:58:26,610 --> 01:58:31,110
and the sorrows and the hopes
of all America's people.

1723
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,090
Well, Joe, that's my story.

1724
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,560
It's too bad Mr. Hesler couldn't
have been there tonight,

1725
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:43,060
Mr. Kane.

1726
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:45,410
Oh, he was there, John.

1727
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:49,493
He'll always be a part of
any music I ever write.

1728
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,590
Whatever happened to Ms. Sally?

1729
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:55,410
Well, I don't know exactly.

1730
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:57,160
She's on her own now.

1731
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:00,740
Maybe I'm just getting tired of something.

1732
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:03,480
But ever since Jim's been gone, I,

1733
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:06,410
I feel like everything
is sort of ending for me.

1734
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:08,060
Maybe my music is ending too.

1735
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:11,000
Joe ending after that show tonight.

1736
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:14,020
Hey, hey, I gotta get
you back to the Waldorf.

1737
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:19,020
You got some vows to take Now, sir, Mr.

1738
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:20,270
Kind.

1739
01:59:20,270 --> 01:59:23,060
Your music ain't ending for you.

1740
01:59:23,060 --> 01:59:24,390
In my opinion.

1741
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:26,390
It's just the beginning.

1742
01:59:44,170 --> 01:59:44,710
She didn't.

1743
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:48,170
Say yes. She didn't say
no, she didn't say stay.

1744
01:59:48,170 --> 01:59:51,330
She didn't say go. She
wasn't so sure about it.

1745
01:59:51,330 --> 01:59:52,450
Be good.

1746
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:56,310
She wasn't even sure that she'd
be good. So what did she do?

1747
01:59:56,310 --> 01:59:57,810
I leave it to you.

1748
02:00:48,570 --> 02:00:49,403
And.

1749
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:24,590
The.

1750
02:01:24,590 --> 02:01:29,560
Last time I saw Paris,
her heart was warm and

1751
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,280
I heard the laughter of
her heart in every street.

1752
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:38,800
The.

1753
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,960
Last time I saw Paris,

1754
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:47,020
her trees were dressed for
spring and lovers walked beneath

1755
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:51,920
those trees and birds on songs to sing.

1756
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:58,200
I dodged the same old taxi cabs
that I had dodged for years.

1757
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:03,900
The chorus of their
squeaky horns was music to

1758
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:12,580
the last time I heart was warm.

1759
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:18,040
And no matter how.

1760
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:16,290
Do sit down, Mr.

1761
02:03:16,290 --> 02:03:18,340
Curry. Oh, you sure we
won't be in the wave?

1762
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:19,260
Oh, certainly not.

1763
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:20,177
Not at all.

1764
02:03:21,190 --> 02:03:23,060
Well, I can't get over this, Mr.

1765
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:23,980
Ed.

1766
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:27,870
We certainly don't grow
stages like this on Broadway.

1767
02:03:27,870 --> 02:03:30,390
Darling. Look at the
size of that orchestra.

1768
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:32,460
Well, you have everything in
the world to work with here.

1769
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:32,880
That's.

1770
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:33,340
Right. Mr.

1771
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:35,540
Can we've tried to give
you the best of everything.

1772
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:36,060
Yes, that.

1773
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:39,390
So what was the number
you were gonna do today?

1774
02:03:39,390 --> 02:03:39,680
Well,

1775
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:43,220
we found an old song of yours
that you did first in 1917

1776
02:03:43,220 --> 02:03:46,580
called The Land Where Good Songs Go.

1777
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:48,970
Oh, I'd almost forgotten about that one.

1778
02:03:48,970 --> 02:03:52,360
We're using it as a frame
for some of your other songs.

1779
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:54,430
What Star is gonna sing this?

1780
02:03:54,430 --> 02:03:55,710
Well, well, Mr.

1781
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:58,540
Kern, as a matter of fact,
we are trying out a newcomer.

1782
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:59,400
Oh, a newcomer.

1783
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,960
This girl did a test for us in
New York and it impressed us.

1784
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,580
So we flew her out here.

1785
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:06,410
She hasn't done much yet, but
we have great hopes for us.

1786
02:04:06,410 --> 02:04:07,540
Quiet.

1787
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,250
Hi girls. We're ready.

1788
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:11,700
Ready for a take? Alright, let's try one.

1789
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:13,030
Places, please.

1790
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:15,610
Okay, Charlie, hit the lights.

1791
02:04:15,610 --> 02:04:16,470
Quiet.

1792
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:17,940
Okay, roll.

1793
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:18,773
Action.

1794
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:55,070
It's land of April

1795
02:04:59,390 --> 02:05:00,807
with Sun Shining.

1796
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:08,650
With.

1797
02:05:08,650 --> 02:05:09,483
Roses.

1798
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:12,930
And.

1799
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:13,763
River.

1800
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:29,590
Mr.

1801
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:31,440
Like him, I love her.

1802
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:35,840
I'd rather hear her sing one
of my songs than anyone else in

1803
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:36,673
the world.

1804
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:44,513
And.

1805
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:57,920
And fall away.

1806
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:00,480
I dream.

1807
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:05,480
I dream one day and that dream is here

1808
02:07:08,180 --> 02:07:09,013
beside.

1809
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:49,680
A fine romance, my friend.

1810
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:55,710
This is a fine romance with no kiss.

1811
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:02,230
I might as well play
bridge with my old maid.

1812
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:05,477
I haven't got a chance.

1813
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:07,383
This is a.

1814
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:28,820
The promise.

1815
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:33,440
Of that,

1816
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,140
the brink of a

1817
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:11,523
the

1818
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:31,373
will

1819
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:47,793
moment.

1820
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,870
When all.

1821
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:35,440
Was I born?

1822
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:41,680
Why am I living?

1823
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:51,260
Do, what am I,

1824
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:08,670
what can I,

1825
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:11,953
I.

1826
02:12:37,590 --> 02:12:42,590
Man river,

1827
02:12:46,490 --> 02:12:51,490
he must know something,
but don't say nothing.

1828
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:58,250
He just, he keeps on

1829
02:13:10,170 --> 02:13:15,170
he dawn plant and he dawn plant.

1830
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:21,670
And what soon

1831
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:46,583
body All

1832
02:14:23,610 --> 02:14:27,470
I'm tired, but I'm.
