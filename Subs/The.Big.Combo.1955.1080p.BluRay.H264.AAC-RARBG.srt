1
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:33,921
- Please let me go.
- We can't do that, Miss Lowell.

2
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:37,133
Mr. Brown wants you should see the
fight, it's only the third round.

3
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:39,886
I'll go back, just let me go by myself.

4
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,097
Mr. Brown is mad already,
we lost you for two minutes.

5
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,308
I promise I won't run away.

6
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:48,728
- Where will I go?
- All right. Let her go.

7
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,413
I've changed my mind.

8
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,374
I don't want to see the fights.

9
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,418
I'm hurlgrY-

10
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:14,921
Call a cab.

11
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,257
Call a cab.

12
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,053
- But, Mr. Brown wants...
- Mr. Brown says to keep her happy, call a cab.

13
00:03:58,256 --> 00:04:00,383
<i>93rd Precinct, Sgz' Leeds.</i>

14
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:03,094
- Sit down! Captain Peterson.
- Yes, sir. I know, sir.

15
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,929
- The Lieutenant?
- He's on duty, sir.

16
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,515
But he's still in his office?
I know! I know!

17
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,105
Hell, Leonard! It's good to see
you relax for a change.

18
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:17,358
- Evening, Captain. Anything urgent?
- Urgent?

19
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:21,320
Anything urgent I leave
to my subordinates.

20
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:25,408
- Got some good 10 cent cigars in that box
over there. - No, thanks. I'm off cigars.

21
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:29,870
Brandy! My doctor's got me off
everything worth living for... almost.

22
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,040
- Leonard?
- Yes, sir?

23
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:36,961
Now, there's got to be a stop to your
complete disregard of the taxpayers money.

24
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:39,547
Paid for this apple out of my
own pocket, Captain.

25
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,759
Leonard, you spent $18,600
in the last six months!

26
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:46,721
Investigating one man, a single man!

27
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,224
Brown's not a man, he's an organization.

28
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,768
And, I need money to fight money.

29
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,148
Now look, Lieutenant. I've got nothing
against you personally, I admire you.

30
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,359
You've got too many brains,
but that's not your fault.

31
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:05,823
Now, what about this $18,600? How am I
going to explain this to the Commissioner?

32
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:10,619
Well, I've... dictated an explanation
if you want to use it.

33
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:17,710
<i>Memorandum to Captain Peterson co vering
expenditures of the 93rd Precinct station.</i>

34
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,504
<i>The Comb/haf/on is growing
stronger every day,</i>

35
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,132
<i>the only Way I0 crush it'
is I0 get' the top man.</i>

36
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:25,760
<i>When Grazz/ lefz' the country, Brown...</i>

37
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:29,805
What do you think this is,
a homicide investigation?

38
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:32,933
You're dealing with the largest pool
of illegal money in the world!

39
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:36,062
You're fighting a swamp
with a... teaspoon.

40
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,231
The Combination keeps
no books, no records.

41
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:42,109
Everything's run on word
of mouth and hard cash!

42
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,986
- That's their one weakness.
- What?

43
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:45,654
They have to have a treasurer.

44
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,656
- So?
- And, I know his name.

45
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,951
The name of a man who can pick up a
phone and call Chicago or New Orleans

46
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:55,956
and say: "Hey, Bill. Joe is coming down
for the weekend, advance him 50,000."

47
00:05:55,998 --> 00:05:59,835
And, he hangs up the phone and the
money is advanced. Protection money!

48
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:04,465
Then a new all night bar opens,
with gambling outside city limits.

49
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:07,760
A bunch of high school kids
come in, for a good time.

50
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:11,389
They get loaded, they get irresponsible.
They lose their shirts.

51
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:15,017
And, they get a gun! Cause they're worried,
they want to make up their loses,

52
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:18,187
and a filling station attendant is
dead with a bullet in his liver!

53
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:24,443
And, I have to see four kids on trial
for first degree murder. Look at it!

54
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,905
First degree murder because a certain
Mr. Brown picked up a phone.

55
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:30,241
You can't touch Brown, he's clean.

56
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,785
We've got nothing on him!
Not even a parking ticket...

57
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:35,079
Yeah, why is he so careful?
It's unnatural!

58
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,581
You can't tell a jury a man's guilty
because he's too innocent...

59
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:40,918
- He's no more innocent than this gun!
- Now stop getting emotional, Leonard!

60
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,254
He's innocent until he's proven guilty.

61
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:45,423
Yes, Captain.

62
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,635
Is there anything else, Captain?

63
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:52,138
Yes.

64
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:53,431
The girl.

65
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,307
Susan Lowell.

66
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,395
You've had a tail on her
for six months. Why?

67
00:07:01,272 --> 00:07:04,775
She's Brown's girl.
She's our most valuable lead.

68
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,487
We know next to nothing
about Brown, but...

69
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,906
a woman knows, she makes
it her business to know.

70
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,867
If I can get a hold of her
and make her talk...

71
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,035
Leonard, you've spent six months trying!

72
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,496
She went to Vegas, you went to Vegas.

73
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,582
She flew to Cuba, you flew to Cuba.

74
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:22,418
You couldn't get authorization for the
expense, paid it out of your own pocket.

75
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,961
I had to, you wouldn't back me up.

76
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,464
Well, I'm not in love with
her, Leonard. You are!

77
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:47,776
This is off the record, Leonard.
It's between friends.

78
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,280
Try to face facts.

79
00:07:53,782 --> 00:07:56,744
You can't bear to think of her
in the arms of this hood.

80
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,370
Forget her!

81
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:05,377
You're a cop, Leonard. There's 17,000
laws on the books to be enforced.

82
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,130
You haven't time to reform
wayward girls.

83
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,675
She's been with Brown
three and a half years.

84
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,844
That's a lot of days...

85
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,222
and nights.

86
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,516
Face it, Leonard...

87
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,811
I'm glad you agree.

88
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:54,385
Just don't run away. We'd only have to come
after you, Mr. Brown wouldn't like that.

89
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,471
Mr. Audubon.

90
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,265
Susan!

91
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,642
Well, I... Well, I'm glad to see you.

92
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:03,936
How are you? It's been years!

93
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,397
Well, you look so different
somehow, Susan. I...

94
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,984
- Well, I hardly recognized you.
- Oh, I'm just the same, Mr. Audubon.

95
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,610
Well, how's your lovely mother?

96
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:14,280
She's in England someplace,
I haven't kept track.

97
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,615
Why, I should think you'd
of gone along. I hear that

98
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,909
Vladovich is playing a Beethoven cycle.

99
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:22,538
I haven't the interest I once had
in the piano, Mr. Audubon.

100
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,498
Well, now I'm disappointed.

101
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,333
You don't play anymore?

102
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,212
The only thing I play now,
Mr. Audubon, is stud poker.

103
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,635
- Will you dance with me, Mr. Audubon?
- Why certainly, Susan.

104
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,679
You all right?

105
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,556
Of course! Of course!

106
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:55,112
The day Mr. Brown lets go
our little lady...

107
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,864
I'll do it personally.

108
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,914
- Mr. Audubon...
- Susan.

109
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:09,043
I've taken some pills,
I think I'm dying.

110
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,127
Susan!

111
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:12,630
Get an ambulance!

112
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,340
She just fell over!

113
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,322
How you feel now, Bennie?

114
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,615
Lost.

115
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,450
I feel terrible, Mr. Brown.

116
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,827
You kept fighting, Bennie.
You've got heart.

117
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,496
I lost three of my teeth too.

118
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,666
All right, so you lost. Next time
you'll win. I'll show you how.

119
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,170
Take a look at Joe McClure here.
He used to be my boss, now I'm his.

120
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,881
What's the difference between
me and him?

121
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,926
We breath the same air,
sleep in the same hotel.

122
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,178
He used to own it!

123
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:03,722
Now it belongs to me.

124
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:06,558
We eat the same steaks,
drink the same bourbon.

125
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:07,642
Look!

126
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:10,145
Same manicure, same cufflinks.

127
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,816
But, there's only one difference...
we don't get the same girls.

128
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,150
VVhy?

129
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:18,404
Because women know the difference!
They got instinct.

130
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,781
First is first and second is nobody.

131
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,326
- The best man won tonight, Mr. Brown.
- You were better than Martinez.

132
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,788
Only, you threw it away. You step in
the ring, you shake hands with him.

133
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,291
You want to be his friend, and you
Want to fight him. No, Bennie. No.

134
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,669
- Mr. Brown.
- Shut the door!

135
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,174
Now, Bennie, who runs the world?
Have you any idea?

136
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:42,177
- Not me, Mr. Brown.
- That's right, not you.

137
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:44,012
But, a funny thing...

138
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:47,266
they're not so much different from you.
They've got something.

139
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:50,519
They've got it and they use it.
I've got it, he hasn't!

140
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,148
So, what is it, Bennie?
What makes the difference?

141
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,359
Hate.

142
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:01,405
Hate is the word, Bennie.
Hate the man who tries to beat you!

143
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,115
Kill him, Bennie! Kill him!

144
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:05,909
Hate until you see red and you'll come
out winning the big money.

145
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:08,787
And, the girls will come tumbling after.

146
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:13,333
You'll have to shut of your phone and
lock the door to get a night's rest.

147
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:18,088
Get on your feet, Bennie.

148
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,139
What you do that for, Mr. Brown?

149
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:30,934
You should have hit me back.
You haven't got the hate.

150
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,354
Tear up Bennie's contract!
He's no good to me anymore.

151
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:42,362
- Where's Susan, in the car?
- I tried to tell you before, Mr. Brown.

152
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,865
- Tell me what?
- She's in General Hospital.

153
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,701
- What happened?
- She took some pills.

154
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:52,414
Get the car and bring it around!
Buy me some cigarettes.

155
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,782
Where is she?

156
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,492
General Hospital.

157
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:31,203
She's dying.

158
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,845
You can take her to the prison ward now.

159
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:51,557
Hello, Lieutenant. This is Mr. Brown.

160
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,854
- What do you want, Mr. Brown?
- Joe, tell the man I want her out.

161
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:00,148
Mr. Brown would like to have Miss Lowell
released, he'll put her in a private hospital

162
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,026
- ls he a relative? - Not exactly.
- Married to her? - Just a personal friend.

163
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:06,280
Ya, visiting days are Tuesdays and Fridays.
I don't know how you two got in here

164
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:09,116
- you can get out the way you came.
- Tell the man not to get excited.

165
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:12,119
Mr. Brown is a very reasonable man,
you don't know him.

166
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:13,579
Oh, is he?

167
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:18,292
Well, I'm not. And, I intend to make life
very difficult for your Mr. Brown.

168
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,373
You shouldn't talk like that, Lieutenant.
You're overstepping your authority.

169
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:24,882
Joe, the man has reason to hate me.
His salary is $96.50 a week.

170
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:27,467
The busboys in my hotel make
better money than that.

171
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,970
Don't you see, Joe?
He's a righteous man.

172
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,222
Personal feelings mean nothing to him.

173
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:35,225
My girl's dying in a public hospital
and I want her out!

174
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,102
She's under arrest, Mr. Brown.

175
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:38,604
- What's the charge?
- Homicide!

176
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,523
- That's ridiculous, she wouldn't kill a fl
- She tried to kill herself.

177
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:44,359
- Is that a crime?
- It happens to be against two laws:

178
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:46,987
God's and Man's. I'm booking
her under the second.

179
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,364
Tell the man if he puts
her on trial I'll...

180
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,296
Alicia!

181
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:06,590
Alicia...

182
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,510
Susan.

183
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:13,472
- Stay away from the prisoner, Mr. Brown.
- Susan, you all right?

184
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,974
Brown, stay where you are!
- Susan!

185
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:22,856
Joe.

186
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,194
Tell the man I'm gonna break him so fast
he won't have time to change his pants!

187
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:29,905
Tell him the next time I see him he'll
be down in the lobby of the hotel,

188
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:32,282
crying like a baby and
asking for a $10 loan!

189
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:35,661
Tell him that!
And, tell him I don't break my word.

190
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,457
You must have done something pretty fine
to get as high as you are, Mr. Brown.

191
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,002
I'm looking into that, I'm gonna open
you up and I'm gonna operate.

192
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,505
And, I hate to think of what I'll find.

193
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,221
What I tell you, Joe'? A righteous man.

194
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,144
Miss Lowell?

195
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,188
Do you hear me, Miss Lowell?

196
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,822
Are you a doctor?

197
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,449
My name is Diamond, I'm a detective.

198
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,536
Let me alone.

199
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,664
I have to ask you certain questions
and you'll have to answer them.

200
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:24,084
I feel so cold. Can't they
turn on the heat?

201
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,253
Can you get some hot coffee, please?

202
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:28,463
If you'd get up and walk
you'd be a lot better off.

203
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:31,008
I want to go to sleep,
just let me sleep.

204
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,720
Here. Just take some of this, come on.

205
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,931
You're very kind.

206
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:39,474
Everyone's kind.

207
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:41,768
I don't deserve it

208
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:43,854
Come on now, take a little of it.

209
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,897
That's it.

210
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:50,277
It's good.

211
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,613
Why did you try to kill yourself?

212
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:58,285
I don't know why. I can't remember.
Please let me go to sleep.

213
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,787
- Were you jealous, is that why? Was there
another woman? - Please, please...

214
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,791
There was another woman wasn't there? You
mentioned her name Alicia ls that right?

215
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,546
What about Alicia? Was
Mr. Brown seeing Alicia?

216
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,883
No! I don't know.
I don't know who she is.

217
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,302
- Then how do you know her name?
- I don't know...

218
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:18,346
You must know, you kept repeating it.
Where'd you first hear it?

219
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,848
I never heard it.

220
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,100
I saw it.

221
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,352
Where'd you see it, on a letter?

222
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,937
In his apartment.

223
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,025
It was raining outside, and...

224
00:17:31,568 --> 00:17:34,279
there was a... mist on the window...

225
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:38,366
He was writing a name on it
with his finger like this...

226
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:41,203
A moist glass...

227
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:43,663
'Alicia'.

228
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,584
And, when he saw me he...

229
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,461
he rubbed it out.

230
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:52,631
- Oh, I'm so cold!
- Where is Alicia now?

231
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,926
- I don't know.
- Didn't you ask him?

232
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,303
He wouldn't tell me.

233
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,474
What was that?

234
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,976
Diesel trucks going by,
it's almost morning.

235
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,312
Was Brown upset when you
asked him about Alicia?

236
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:10,607
I don't know any answers! Don't touch
me! Go away! Please, go away!

237
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,568
You think you're the bright, respectable
girl you were four years ago, you're not!

238
00:18:13,652 --> 00:18:16,822
You attempted suicide, you're under arrest!
You could be sent to jail for six months!

239
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:19,157
Nurse! May I have some water please?

240
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,743
- Miss Lowell, answer one question.
- No!

241
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:24,079
- Who is Alicia?
- You tell me.

242
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,831
Get on your feet!

243
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:30,669
- There's a man downstairs with a
writ of habeas corpus. - Already?

244
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,337
It's McClure, what'll I tell him?

245
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,506
You know what habeas
corpus means, Sam?

246
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,007
I know what it does.

247
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:38,468
It's Latin, it means:
"you may have the body".

248
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,262
Mr. Brown may have it.

249
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:45,517
Sam.

250
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,063
We got to find out who Alicia is.

251
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:53,692
I want you to pick up every hood
who works for Brown.

252
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,570
And, pick up Brown himself.

253
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,320
- What's up?
- He's crazy

254
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:40,822
- Who?
- Diamond! He's crazy!

255
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:42,866
What happened, McClure?

256
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,827
When they picked us up
I mentioned your name.

257
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:47,495
You know what they said?

258
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,416
Quit shaking. What'd he ask you?

259
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,544
A girl's name!
That's all he kept asking.

260
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:56,922
He just kept asking me this girl's name.

261
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,716
- Like he was nuts!
- He's crazy.

262
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,009
What girl?

263
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:04,429
They knocked it outta my head.
I don't know...

264
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,892
Alice-something or another...
Alicia! That's what it was. Alicia.

265
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:10,852
What'd you tell him?

266
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:13,772
Exactly what I know... nothing.

267
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:18,777
That's right, Fante. You know nothing,
absolutely nothing... and don't forget it.

268
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,371
I got a right to make a phone call.

269
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,457
- Who do you wanna call'?
- Mr. Brown.

270
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,961
Mr. Brown's a little busy right now
in a conference with Mr. Diamond.

271
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:40,090
You know, legally I don't have
to submit to this test.

272
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,926
I know, we appreciate your
cooperation, Mr. Brown.

273
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,386
And, if I say no?

274
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:48,431
Well, if you say no I have a lot of questions
to ask, you may be sitting in that chair

275
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:51,726
for a couple of days. This way I can
tell if you're lying in a few minutes.

276
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,770
Go ahead, lad. Let's get it over with.

277
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:56,439
Picking me up for peddling
without a license,

278
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,067
you could have thought of something
better than that, Lieutenant.

279
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:03,113
I prefer it to be suspicion of murder,
but... we had none today.

280
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:06,950
I would have been happy to accommodate
you, a police lieutenant.

281
00:21:08,994 --> 00:21:12,747
Now, I'm gonna say one word at a time,
most of them won't mean a thing to you.

282
00:21:12,914 --> 00:21:15,166
But, I want you to say whatever
pops into your head.

283
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,294
- Like, if I say sweet...
- I say sugar.

284
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:19,004
If I say police...

285
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:20,672
<i>I</i> say $96.50.

286
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:22,423
APDle.

287
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:23,466
Pean

288
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,135
- Blue.
- Ocean.

289
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:26,219
Brown.

290
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:29,139
Mr. Brown to you, only my
friends call me Brown.

291
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:32,892
Water.

292
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:34,351
Whiskey.

293
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,146
- Gun.
- Permit.

294
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:38,273
- Spaghetti.
- Bettini.

295
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:42,402
- What? What's that?
- What's what?

296
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:43,903
Bettini.

297
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,698
Spaghetti joint on the north side.

298
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:50,160
- Since when? Never heard of it.
- You couldn't afford it.

299
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,537
- Go ahead, Joe.
- Women.

300
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:53,872
Expensive.

301
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,790
- Snow.
- White.

302
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:57,042
Alicia.

303
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:03,048
- What was the name again?
- A woman's name... Alicia.

304
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:05,884
- No.
- No what?

305
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,844
I said no, you want me to say it again?

306
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,346
- You know Alicia, don't you?

307
00:22:09,387 --> 00:22:10,847
- Sure.
- Who is she?

308
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,558
A two year old filly that broke her
leg in the Jamaican stakes.

309
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,603
- I lost 1O grand.
- You're lying, Mr. Brown.

310
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:20,440
When you heard Alicia your heart went bang,
you don't lie with your blood pressure

311
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,817
Do you know what this means?
It means you're scared.

312
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:26,654
Mr. Brown isn't scared of a horse. Who
is she, what does she mean to you?

313
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:29,741
If that's a crime, book me!

314
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:33,161
Book me, small change.

315
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:35,747
All right, take him out, Sam.

316
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:37,916
To the bullpen?

317
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,418
No, back to the gutter.

318
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:47,717
Mr. Brown is a very influential citizen.

319
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,679
I ducked 14 calls from the Commissioner
today, the 15th caught me.

320
00:22:52,514 --> 00:22:54,432
One more call and I'm out.

321
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,686
Leonard, what were you doing?

322
00:22:58,728 --> 00:23:01,189
Just give me one possible
explanation, that's all I ask.

323
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,900
I was following a lead,
I was being logical.

324
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:07,195
96 false arrests...

325
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,241
- How am I going to explain?
- You'll only have to explain 95...

326
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:15,578
Sam, what'll I do with Leonard?
Tell me what to do!

327
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,498
Just give me another 18,000
for the Brown case.

328
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,876
The Brown case is closed. Kaput!

329
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:25,004
The end, no more! Case closed!

330
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:35,682
Hey, Sam...

331
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:39,436
What was the name of that
hood we failed to pick up?

332
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:41,438
Ralph Bettini.

333
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,149
How long ago did he drop out of sight?

334
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:46,359
About seven years ago, why?

335
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:50,989
That's about the same time that Grazzi
left the country and Brown took over.

336
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,907
Yeah, so?

337
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,660
Take a look at that graph.

338
00:23:57,287 --> 00:24:00,290
See how itjumped after he said Bettini?

339
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,960
Bettini's was the only warrant
we failed to serve.

340
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:07,255
He hasn't been around for
years, maybe he's dead.

341
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:08,965
No, he's not. I...

342
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,759
checked the morgue, the
files, there's nothing.

343
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,388
Why don't you go home? Get some rest.

344
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,141
No, I've got a call to make first.

345
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,393
Leonard.

346
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:23,062
Peterson meant what he said.

347
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:26,399
You cross him, it means we're both out.

348
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:29,736
What can we lose, $96.50 a week?

349
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:20,286
- Oh, you've certainly got a nerve!
- Hi, Rita.

350
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:23,498
What's on your mind?
As if I didn't know.

351
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:28,086
- Thought maybe we could go dancing.
- I've been dancing, Lieutenant.

352
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:31,673
Further more, you haven't been around
here for six months. And, further more,

353
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:35,969
if you want a date do what the others
do, call me first... a week in advance.

354
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,512
Rita, I...

355
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:40,890
I'm giving a party tonight. I thought
maybe you'd like to come?

356
00:25:41,558 --> 00:25:42,809
A party?

357
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:44,894
Who's gonna be there?

358
00:25:45,103 --> 00:25:46,563
Just you and me.

359
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,231
The joke stinks!

360
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:52,193
Lieutenant... either book
me or let go of my arm!

361
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,366
Leonard.

362
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:01,494
Leonard!

363
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,753
Take me to the party.

364
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:17,635
You're a beautiful girl, Rita.

365
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,224
But, you're stupid.

366
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,060
You can't say anything nice
without spoiling it.

367
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,022
Why do you waste your time with a cop?

368
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:33,067
You could get rne a nice, rich hoodlum.

369
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:35,820
You should be able to recommend
one with your connections.

370
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:39,198
What is there about a hoodlum that
appeals to certain women?

371
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,909
Hoodlums... detectives...

372
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:44,912
A woman doesn't care how
a man makes his living...

373
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:47,540
only how he makes love.

374
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:51,502
Who is she, Leonard?

375
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,632
I'm stupid, Leonard, about
everything but men.

376
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:58,593
Them... I know.

377
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,680
Give me my shoes, I'm going home.

378
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,311
Put them on for me.

379
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,282
When she hurts you again, baby...

380
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:23,868
don't wait six months.

381
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,097
Yes... I'm having a drink.

382
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:48,101
Well, don't forget me as
if I were a lush!

383
00:27:48,142 --> 00:27:49,811
That music, turn it off.

384
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,897
- I enjoy it.
- I said turn it off.

385
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,403
What are we so cheerful about today?

386
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,989
- Where did you get that outfit?
- What's wrong with it?

387
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:05,535
I like you better in white. You got a dozen
white dresses, why don't you wear them?

388
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:07,411
White doesn't please me anymore.

389
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:10,665
A woman dresses for a man, you dress
for me. G0 put on something white!

390
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,291
I won't!

391
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:17,505
What's the matter with you?

392
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:19,215
What have I done now?

393
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:22,510
Before I came in when you were playing
that record, what were you thinking?

394
00:28:23,094 --> 00:28:25,763
I was trying to remember how
I fell in love with you.

395
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:28,182
That's so hard to remember?

396
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:32,145
A girl's first love shouldn't be,
it should be her only.

397
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,648
Maybe that's why I can't leave you.

398
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:38,109
We'll talk about love some other time.

399
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:40,737
You know what I've been doing,
what's been happening?

400
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:44,115
People tell me all sorts of things,
I don't listen.

401
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:48,536
I didn't ask you before,
you were sick...

402
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,080
What did Diamond tell you?

403
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:54,959
Diamond! Lieutenant Diamond!

404
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,378
Detective, 93rd Precinct.

405
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,548
He grilled you for three hours in
the hospital, what did he tell you?

406
00:29:00,757 --> 00:29:03,259
- He kept asking me about a girl.
- What girl?

407
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,137
- Her name was Alicia.
- Who's she?

408
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:07,847
I don't know.

409
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:11,267
- He was very insistent.
- What was the name again?

410
00:29:11,976 --> 00:29:13,269
Alicia.

411
00:29:16,272 --> 00:29:18,107
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

412
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,700
Susan, tell me, come on...

413
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:29,619
What's bothering you?

414
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:32,663
I hate and despise you!

415
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,837
Susan... what are you trying
to do, drive rne bats?

416
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,216
What do you want, Susan? Tell me!

417
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:45,885
- I'll give you anything you want, tell me.
- Nothing!

418
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:47,970
- Anything at all.
- Nothing! Nothing...

419
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:03,194
Lieutenant, you got a call while the Captain
was in, I didn't want to disturb you. - Who?

420
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:07,198
She just said "Rita". She wants to see
you and said you'd know where. - Thanks!

421
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,258
Say, Lieutenant!

422
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,551
Hi, Pop.

423
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:29,846
If you're looking for Rita, she's
in her dressing room. - Thanks!

424
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:37,270
- Hi, Rita.
- You certainly took your time getting here!

425
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:39,772
Come on, I've had a bad day.
Don't give me anymore.

426
00:30:39,814 --> 00:30:42,692
What I've got to tell you is not good.
Fix this for me, will you?

427
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:43,818
Tell it!

428
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:46,779
Keep blowing your cork,
pinching half the town!

429
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:50,283
- There's a big mad on you and
it's burning all over! - ls that it?

430
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,995
- They're quoting a price on you, you'd
better take a vacation. - What'd you hear?

431
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:57,623
It's all around, I picked up bits here
and there. What are you gonna do?

432
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:59,876
Just what I've been doing only more.

433
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,377
Are you trying to...

434
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:04,046
Are you trying to get yourself
killed, Leonard?

435
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,966
Brown doesn't kill to get what
he wants, he buys.

436
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,427
Then you'd better sellout
or start running.

437
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,637
Hey, you're really worried about me.

438
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,097
A little.

439
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,599
That's enough.

440
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:17,268
That's a lot for me.

441
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,770
That's my music!

442
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:25,860
- Leonard! - Yeah?
- When will I see you again?

443
00:31:25,902 --> 00:31:28,988
Well, if I'm not dead you'll find
me where I always am, in jail.

444
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,348
Shut up! Let's get him out of here!

445
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,410
When's he gonna wake up, Christmas?

446
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,996
Shoot me with my own gun,
that's what gets me.

447
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,665
Fante!

448
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,459
- Let me wake him up.
- Leave him alone!

449
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:27,129
Mr. Brown doesn't want to draw
any blood or show any marks.

450
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:29,006
May I talk to Mr. Brown?

451
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,593
Let me at him, Fante.
Two minutes is all I'll need.

452
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:35,638
- What for?
- I want to ask him one question.

453
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,766
All right, go ahead. He's all yours...

454
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:40,476
but, first...

455
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:42,561
Papen

456
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:45,815
Fante, we're friends. You
don't hold up a friend.

457
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:46,856
Papen

458
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:50,069
- Didn't Mr. Brown pay you?
- You're not Mr. Brown.

459
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:54,740
For Mr. Brown I'd snatch a judge from the
Superior Court, for a chocolate soda.

460
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:58,244
- Same goes for Mingo. Right, Mingo?
- Yeah!

461
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:01,664
- How much?
- A hundred.

462
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:03,958
- For Mingo too.
- What?

463
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,918
A hundred... each.

464
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,840
Mifigg!

465
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:15,761
Thanks, Fante.

466
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,848
Now ask him all the questions you want.

467
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:34,488
What did you pick me up for?

468
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:40,661
I asked you a question!
Why did you pick me up?

469
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:44,623
I'm talking to you, answer me!

470
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,126
Why'd you pick me up?

471
00:33:50,921 --> 00:33:54,467
There he is, Mr. Brown.
I was softening him up for you.

472
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:57,970
- I did a pretty good job.
- I told you not to touch him.

473
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:00,389
I didn't hurt him, we're still legal.

474
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:03,976
The trouble with you, McClure, is that
you never took time to learn technique.

475
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,395
Fante! Mingo! Bring that
radio over here.

476
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:13,152
Turn it on.

477
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,992
I only want to borrow it, Joe.

478
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,798
We're gonna give the Lieutenant
a little concert.

479
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:38,636
- How's that?
- T00 loud, turn it down.

480
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:43,349
Can you hear me, Lieutenant?

481
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:50,314
I just want to ask you one question
and then you can go.

482
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,859
What are you looking for?
Maybe I can help you?

483
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,780
What about Alicia?

484
00:34:58,072 --> 00:35:00,950
What's your information?
Arresting all my friends!

485
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:02,785
Phoney warrants!

486
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,162
What's behind it'?

487
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,669
Mingo, try it.

488
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:21,178
Now, don't be stubborn, Lieutenant.

489
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:24,723
What about Alicia?

490
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:31,355
Why don't you ask yourself?

491
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,115
Nice break coming up, a kid on drums...

492
00:35:41,157 --> 00:35:42,616
Real crazy!

493
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:47,413
You like crazy drums, Lieutenant?
Have a good time.

494
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:11,437
I think Mr. Diamond needs a drink.

495
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,106
Got any liquor?

496
00:36:18,652 --> 00:36:21,780
- How about some paint thinner?
- No, that'll kill him. Anything else?

497
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:25,326
- Antonio (?), 40 % alcohol.
- Fine.

498
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:29,455
Come down here and hold his head, Fante.

499
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:01,278
Now, let him go.

500
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,198
Shove him off.

501
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,961
Look at that drunken cop.
Isn't that a shame?

502
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:28,305
Hold him!

503
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,200
Diamond, what are you doing here?

504
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,287
Well, well... Leonard.

505
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:53,998
You're drunk! My congratulations!

506
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:55,916
Come in.

507
00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:04,383
The gall of him... grabbed one of my
own officers. Slug him, torture him!

508
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:07,678
- You were right, Leonard. They're
afraid of something. - Alicia.

509
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,054
Well, that's a start.

510
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,307
Let's go to work on Brown.

511
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:13,892
I'd like to start by picking up
Brown and company...

512
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:15,644
Well, you can't. They outsmarted you.

513
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,980
Take a look in the mirror,
there's not a mark on you!

514
00:38:18,022 --> 00:38:21,400
You were drunk, you came here on
your own. That's the defense.

515
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:24,403
And it's airtight, Leonard. That's
why Brown delivered you here.

516
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:27,489
His chief witness is me, Peterson!
I'm sorry, Leonard.

517
00:38:28,324 --> 00:38:30,743
- Alicia...
- Alicia! Alicia!

518
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:34,413
They don't know if it's a horse,
a boat, or a girl.

519
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,541
- What else have you got?
- Another name cropped up: Bettini.

520
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:40,336
- Bettini? - You ever hear of him?
- Ya, where does he fit in?

521
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:43,630
Out of 97 warrants he was the only
one we couldn't pick up.

522
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:46,508
He turned up again on
Brown's lie detector...

523
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,844
Sit down, Leonard.
I remember him.

524
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:53,223
He was Grazzi's right-hand man, before
Brown, before McClure from my generation.

525
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:56,143
He dropped out when Grazzi
had to leave the country.

526
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:57,728
- Dead?
- No, scared.

527
00:38:57,895 --> 00:39:00,147
He didn't fit in with Brown's new setup.

528
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,649
None of the old crowd did.

529
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:05,277
Bettini didn't wait around
to get himself killed.

530
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:08,614
Turned honest citizen. Changed
his name and went into hiding.

531
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:09,990
Do you know where?

532
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,786
I did him a favor once. I could of put him
away for something he didn't do.

533
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:15,204
I let it pass.

534
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:18,791
He did deserve it, considering
all the times he was guilty

535
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:21,513
- and I didn't have the evidence.
- Well, tell me where to find him.

536
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:24,088
He'll be scared, Leonard.
Too scared to talk.

537
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:26,548
If he's that scared, he'll listen.

538
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,876
Come in.

539
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:09,174
Not yet.

540
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:11,301
Just a minute...

541
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,720
That's all I ask, just a minute.

542
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:16,265
Let me turn off the stove.

543
00:40:16,723 --> 00:40:20,310
It could cause a fire, lots of nice old
people in the building. Okay?

544
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:26,900
I've been... waiting for you a long time.

545
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:30,529
You... look like such a nice,
young feller.

546
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:34,241
That Brown sure know how to pick 'em.

547
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:36,577
I would never of suspected.

548
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:40,831
Can I lie down... make it easy?

549
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,420
Come closer.

550
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:49,465
One shot ought to do it.

551
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:52,134
You're not going to die, Mr. Bettini.

552
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:54,511
I've got no money to offer you.

553
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:56,847
I've got something to offer you.

554
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,808
Don't fool with me, young fella!
Get it over with!

555
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:04,605
Mr. Brown didn't send me. My name is
Diamond. Lt Diamond, 93rd Precinct.

556
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:09,526
If you'll help me...

557
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:12,446
I can put your nightmare away.

558
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:15,073
I can't.

559
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,120
I can't even help myself,
how could I help you?

560
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:22,956
I'm looking for a name... Alicia.

561
00:41:23,665 --> 00:41:26,293
You ever hear of her?
Mean anything to you?

562
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,839
Alicia...

563
00:41:31,507 --> 00:41:33,300
is Mr. Brown's wife.

564
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:34,760
Who told you?

565
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:36,220
She told me.

566
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:39,181
She was a good girl.

567
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:42,351
Healthy, right off the farm.

568
00:41:43,685 --> 00:41:46,396
Brown married her when
he was a prison guard.

569
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,985
Two years later she was a lush,
she'd drink anything.

570
00:41:54,738 --> 00:41:55,906
Then...

571
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,075
Brown got tired of her.

572
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:00,702
So, he got rid of her!

573
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:08,377
Take your time, Mr. Bettini.

574
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,257
He was on Grazi's boat...

575
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,593
three days out from Portugal.

576
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:20,514
Alicia... came to the table drunk.

577
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,225
Brown told her to go sleep it off.

578
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,269
She called him a name.

579
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:28,188
Grazzi laughed, not Brown.

580
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,276
I remember the look on Brown's face...

581
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:34,444
and then he hit her.

582
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,072
Then she got up from the
table and she...

583
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:40,325
pulled of her wedding ring. It was
hard to pull off, it must've been...

584
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:42,911
grown to her finger.

585
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,289
She pulled it off and throw
it in the ocean.

586
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,292
Then what?

587
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:51,503
Then she went to her cabin...

588
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,383
- I never seen her again.
- What happened to her?

589
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:01,263
How do you know?

590
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:03,932
I know Brown.

591
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:06,310
I know Brown too, that's no evidence.

592
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:10,147
Then... there was the ship's anchor.

593
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:11,773
What about it?

594
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:15,360
We stopped at the Azores...

595
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,196
and the skipper went to shore
and got another one.

596
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,742
You think she was murdered, then...

597
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:24,328
tied to the ship's anchor and
dropped into the sea?

598
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:26,997
I don't know which came first...

599
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:29,791
I jumped ship the moment we landed.

600
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,627
Who was the skipper?

601
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:36,214
Some Swede.

602
00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:38,008
What was his name?

603
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:42,387
- I never talked to the man.
- What did he look like?

604
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:45,807
A uniform. Who looks at the uniform?

605
00:43:49,686 --> 00:43:51,980
It's important, Mr. Bettini.

606
00:43:52,147 --> 00:43:55,150
If the anchor was used the skipper
would surely know.

607
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:59,613
He'd have to be paid off,
or... killed off.

608
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:03,075
Now, try... Please try to
remember his name.

609
00:44:03,909 --> 00:44:06,662
Go away! Leave me alone!

610
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:11,958
Seven years I don't talk to nobody,
now I talk too much.

611
00:44:13,043 --> 00:44:15,420
You'll have to come with me, Mr. Bettini.

612
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:22,761
You're locking me up?

613
00:44:23,136 --> 00:44:25,430
The next stranger who comes in...

614
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:27,557
won't be from the police.

615
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:29,601
You'll be safer with us.

616
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:34,523
You better... Pack your things.

617
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:37,150
I got them all on me.

618
00:44:40,654 --> 00:44:42,114
Except this.

619
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:51,832
How come a nice guy like you is a cop?

620
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:54,251
Just lucky I guess.

621
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:02,467
You like antiques, Officer?

622
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,678
Who can afford them?

623
00:45:06,555 --> 00:45:10,058
If you're a captain on a boat
borne for Portugal...

624
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:14,312
and you keep your mouth shut...

625
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:18,191
you can buy a lot of antiques.

626
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:21,111
Maybe a whole store full.

627
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:33,457
Yes, my love. That is what
I've been telling you

628
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:35,792
for the last five minutes,
but you don't listen.

629
00:45:36,001 --> 00:45:38,754
Well, be calm, we can change our plans.

630
00:45:53,393 --> 00:45:55,479
What can I do for you, Sir?

631
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:57,647
I'm Lt Diamond, police.

632
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:00,108
Diamond! Expensive name.

633
00:46:00,984 --> 00:46:04,488
I won't take much of your time, Mr. Dreyer.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

634
00:46:04,571 --> 00:46:05,571
Please.

635
00:46:05,572 --> 00:46:09,534
- It's about a large purchase you made.
- Yeah, well I have complete books.

636
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:13,747
Every dollar is there in black and
white... unless it goes in the red!

637
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,666
This purchase was made in 1946.

638
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,376
1946!

639
00:46:18,794 --> 00:46:21,546
I'm sorry, I was not in business then.

640
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:23,882
So, I... I can't help you.

641
00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:28,053
I was hoping you'd have some record,
it's... about the purchase of an anchor.

642
00:46:28,637 --> 00:46:30,347
I don't understand.

643
00:46:30,597 --> 00:46:33,809
In 1946 you were skipper
of a private boat,

644
00:46:34,017 --> 00:46:36,770
bound from New York Harbor
for Lisbon, Portugal.

645
00:46:36,937 --> 00:46:40,440
On the way you stopped at the Azores
and bought a new anchor. Why?

646
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:46,988
I don't understand...

647
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:49,407
Well, try a little harder.

648
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,827
You don't know me, I'm very stupid.

649
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:54,996
The boat was a cabin cruiser
owned by Grazzi.

650
00:46:55,372 --> 00:46:59,000
It's now being operated by a Mr. Brown.
Do you know Mr. Brown?

651
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:02,462
I had lunch with him last week,
he's a very fine gentleman.

652
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:04,089
He's a hoodlum.

653
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,634
Because I have lunch with him,
that is not a crime.

654
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:10,470
I have lunch with anybody,
I'm democratic.

655
00:47:10,554 --> 00:47:12,556
I'll even have lunch with you.

656
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,100
Who paid for this shop?

657
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:16,518
Me, Dreyer.

658
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,938
You, Dreyer, borrowed the money
from the Bolomac (?) Corporation.

659
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:23,191
The Bolemac Corporation is Brown,
or Brown and Grazzi.

660
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,819
Mr. Brown doesn't pay money for nothing.

661
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,448
What makes you so valuable to Mr. Brown?
What do you have on him?

662
00:47:30,824 --> 00:47:35,745
My name is Nils Dreyer, I live at 821 Mason
Avenue. That is all I have to tell you.

663
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:39,749
You know, Mr. Dreyer. Things changed
since I walked in here.

664
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:43,253
- Brown knows I'm here, he knows I'm
talking to you. - I said nothing.

665
00:47:43,336 --> 00:47:45,297
Yeah, but Brown doesn't know that.

666
00:47:47,507 --> 00:47:51,511
In exchange for information, Mr. Dreyer,
I'll give you protection.

667
00:47:51,553 --> 00:47:54,139
I'll do better than that,
I'll put you in jail.

668
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:58,894
Suppose you put me in jail. The man in
the next cell happens to have a gun.

669
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:03,565
Boom! One dead Swede. Thank you
very kindly, I'll remain stupid.

670
00:48:04,357 --> 00:48:07,736
How did you get in here, Sir?
The store is closed.

671
00:48:07,777 --> 00:48:10,280
I am late for an appointment,
if you'll excuse me.

672
00:48:10,822 --> 00:48:15,201
Mr. Dreyer, the secret you think keeps
you safe will blow up in your face.

673
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:17,412
You're dealing with a...

674
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:19,205
a ruthless man.

675
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:23,335
Mr. Diamond, I was a seaman for 30 years.

676
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:25,545
I went to sea aged 14.

677
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:29,758
I've seen storms, I've seen gunfire
and I've seen torpedoes.

678
00:48:29,883 --> 00:48:32,302
I've been wrecked not once, four times!

679
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:35,013
On a raft, 37 days, nothing but water.

680
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,848
Nothing kills me.

681
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:40,477
I'll die in Stockholm like my
great-grandfather, aged 93.

682
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:44,439
I'm not scared of anyone
including you, so... get out.

683
00:48:48,568 --> 00:48:50,570
If you change your mind, Mr. Dreyer,

684
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:53,573
just phone the 93rd Precinct,
I'll send a squad car for you.

685
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:20,308
Hello?

686
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:21,851
Hello?

687
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,728
Hello!

688
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:11,693
Sit down, Joe.

689
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,913
I wanted him here alive, what happened?

690
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:26,541
He had a gun. Didn't he, Fante?

691
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,294
- He had a gun all right, Mr. Br...
- I told you to go without guns!

692
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:32,338
- Which one of you changed my mind?
- I didn't have any gun with me.

693
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:34,632
- Mingo?
- It wasn't me, I swear.

694
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,803
Well, he pulled a gun on me,
what'd you want me to do?

695
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:41,347
With your kind of brain there was
nothing else he could do!

696
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:44,017
Now, listen to me you two.
Go about your business.

697
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,561
Go where you ordinarily go,
do what you ordinarily do!

698
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,605
If they ask questions, say nothing!

699
00:50:48,688 --> 00:50:52,525
And you, get upstairs, go to bed, stay
there! You been sick, understand? Sick!

700
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,736
And, if they take you to
police headquarters...

701
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:57,489
shoot yourself in the head.
It'll make everything a lot simpler.

702
00:50:57,947 --> 00:50:59,282
Now, get out!

703
00:51:06,081 --> 00:51:07,165
JOe!

704
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,751
Come here.

705
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:16,841
Why did you do it, Joe?

706
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:21,262
- I thought he'd pulled a gun on me.
- I'm trying to run an impersonal business.

707
00:51:21,346 --> 00:51:25,100
Killing is very personal.
Once it gets started it's hard to stop.

708
00:51:25,558 --> 00:51:28,645
I could understand it if you were a
trigger happy punk, but you're not.

709
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:30,772
You're an experienced man, Joe.

710
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:32,774
Why did you do it?

711
00:51:36,236 --> 00:51:39,447
- I guess I'm getting too old to handle a gun.
- Yeah...

712
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:41,533
Maybe you're just getting too old, Joe.

713
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:43,827
You don't like rne much, do you?

714
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:47,329
You figure when Grazzi left the country
you should've taken over instead of me.

715
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:48,373
Is that it?

716
00:51:48,915 --> 00:51:51,042
No... the job's too big for me.

717
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:53,586
Yeah... you say that but
you don't mean it.

718
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,464
Give me your gun, Joe.

719
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:08,977
Come on!

720
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:14,983
See what I mean, Joe?

721
00:52:15,024 --> 00:52:17,360
Two seconds ago you had
this gun in your hand.

722
00:52:17,443 --> 00:52:18,945
We're all alone here.

723
00:52:19,154 --> 00:52:22,615
The thought of using it flashed through
your mind... but, you couldn't.

724
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:25,660
But you didn't hesitate to use
it on Dreyer, why?

725
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:29,289
Because he was a little man, Joe.
Like you, a little man.

726
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:33,960
You got a soft job and good pay.
Stop thinking about what might have been.

727
00:52:34,377 --> 00:52:35,753
And, who knows...

728
00:52:35,962 --> 00:52:37,964
You may live to die in bed.

729
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:40,175
That's all, Joe.

730
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:06,701
- It's empty!
- It can't be.

731
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:10,455
- Did anybody open this since yesterday?
- Miss Hartleby? - Impossible, Sir.

732
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,165
What do you got?

733
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:19,130
It was Dreyer's life insurance.

734
00:53:19,214 --> 00:53:21,549
Where would an ex-sailor
keep a log book?

735
00:53:21,674 --> 00:53:26,012
Dreyer was a very meticulous man, he kept a
complete record of everything in his shop.

736
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,680
In his shop...

737
00:53:34,229 --> 00:53:37,273
If you're looking for the log of
Grazzi's yacht in the summer of '46

738
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:38,691
you'll find it in there.

739
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:51,788
Sam, get the DA's office and get a
warrant for Brown's arrest.

740
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:54,082
- On what charge?
- Ahh... Arson!

741
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:56,668
I got a court order,
issued this morning.

742
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:00,630
It says that all the deeds, papers and
properties of this shop belong to me.

743
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:02,340
Dreyer had 20 %.

744
00:54:02,423 --> 00:54:06,803
The Bolemac Corporation had the rest and
I'm the Bolemac Corporation. Nobody else.

745
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:09,472
- Not even Grazzi?
- I bought him out.

746
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:14,102
Why should the Bolemac Corporation be
interested burning that ship's log? Why?

747
00:54:14,143 --> 00:54:17,605
Liquidation of assets.
Which is hardly a crime.

748
00:54:19,232 --> 00:54:22,485
I'll wait until I can put you
on trial for murder.

749
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:24,570
Who's murder, Lieutenant?

750
00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:27,991
- Mine, if necessary.
- Don't push too hard.

751
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,702
It's my sworn duty to push too hard.

752
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,830
Diamond, the only trouble with you
is you'd like to be me.

753
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:36,916
You'd like to have my organization,
my influence, my fix.

754
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,751
You can't, it's impossible.

755
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,004
You think it's money, it's not.

756
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:44,424
It's personality... You haven't got it,
Lieutenant, you're a cop.

757
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:47,385
Slow, steady, intelligent...

758
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:50,972
With a bad temper..
And a gun under your arm.

759
00:54:51,806 --> 00:54:54,517
Or, the big yearn for a girl
you can't have.

760
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:57,145
First is first and second is nobody.

761
00:54:57,854 --> 00:55:00,148
The DA's out, I have his assistant.

762
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,984
Hang up, Sam.

763
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,610
Miss Lowell.

764
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:51,908
Go away, please.

765
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,159
I'll only be a minute, Miss Lowell.

766
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,038
- Why here? Can't it wait?
- No.

767
00:55:57,663 --> 00:55:59,916
Well... what is it, please?

768
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:03,002
- I've come to ask you a favor.
- Do I owe you one?

769
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,255
I want you to leave Mr. Brown.

770
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:10,593
I've asked you to leave, Mr. Diamond.

771
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:15,014
- Well, if you don't I will.
- You think this is mink, Miss Lowell?

772
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:19,602
Do you think these are the skins of wild
animals sewn together for your pleasure?

773
00:56:19,936 --> 00:56:21,646
You're mistaken.

774
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:25,650
- Take your hands off... - These are skins
of human beings, Miss Lowell.

775
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:28,820
People who have been beaten,
sold, robbed...

776
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:31,447
doped and murdered by Mr. Brown.

777
00:56:43,793 --> 00:56:46,337
I didn't come here to
hurt you, Miss Lowell.

778
00:56:46,379 --> 00:56:49,006
You don't have to see me again or
even speak to me again, but...

779
00:56:49,048 --> 00:56:50,883
save yourself, leave him.

780
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,302
How?

781
00:56:53,886 --> 00:56:56,347
All you have to do is walk out.

782
00:56:56,556 --> 00:56:58,641
Is that all, Mr. Diamond?

783
00:56:59,684 --> 00:57:02,728
You followed me long enough
to know I... can't.

784
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,192
I live in a maze, Mr. Diamond.

785
00:57:08,234 --> 00:57:11,571
A strange, blind and backward maze.

786
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:15,867
And all the little twisting paths...
lead back to Mr. Brown.

787
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,495
I can't but that, Miss Lowell.

788
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:21,622
Not in a million years.

789
00:57:25,293 --> 00:57:28,087
Why do you want to change
my life, Mr. Diamond?

790
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:32,925
My boss says I'm in love with you.

791
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,015
I keep telling myself I'm...
just doing my job.

792
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:42,310
Is that why you came to see me?

793
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:44,562
No.

794
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:47,857
I brought you a present.

795
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,693
Keep it or burn itjust as you please.

796
00:57:50,943 --> 00:57:52,195
What is it?

797
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,655
It's a photograph of brown's wife.

798
00:57:54,864 --> 00:57:56,657
Her name was Alicia.

799
00:57:57,867 --> 00:58:00,036
You might ask him what happened.

800
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:41,827
- Who is it?
- Susan.

801
00:58:45,623 --> 00:58:47,124
It's only 10:30.

802
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,169
Was the concert that dull?

803
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,716
Take your hands off me!

804
00:58:55,758 --> 00:58:56,842
Okay.

805
00:58:58,469 --> 00:59:01,806
- I want to talk to you.
- Not now, later. - No, now!

806
00:59:02,223 --> 00:59:04,267
Come here, I want to show you something.

807
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,699
- What is all this?
- This is my bank.

808
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:23,494
I could've built this vault in my apartment,
but that would have been too obvious.

809
00:59:23,703 --> 00:59:26,414
We don't take checks,
we deal strictly in cash.

810
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,543
There isn't anybody I would trust with
so much temptation except myself.

811
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:33,504
Or, maybe you.

812
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:36,132
Trust me.

813
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,175
Who'd you see at the concert?

814
00:59:38,217 --> 00:59:40,553
- Nobody.
- A nobody by the name of Diamond.

815
00:59:40,636 --> 00:59:43,055
Then, why do you ask?
You know everything.

816
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:47,602
There's one thing Mingo and Fante can't
tell you, whether I still love you.

817
00:59:47,643 --> 00:59:50,771
- What did Diamond tell you?
- That he's in love with me.

818
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:58,821
Diamond in love? That's not possible,
anymore than this clever machine.

819
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:02,450
- The machine gave me a strange present.
- What was it, a pair of handcuffs?

820
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,707
I want to meet her.

821
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,668
- I want to meet your wife, Mr. Brown.
- You can't.

822
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:15,129
- Why, because she's dead?
- No, she's alive.

823
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,673
She's living in Sicily,
in Grazzi's house.

824
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:20,468
This was taken a month ago,
came with one of her letters.

825
01:00:20,509 --> 01:00:23,304
- Why did she send it to you?
- She wants to come back.

826
01:00:23,638 --> 01:00:26,265
- Why did you leave her?
- I don't want to talk about it!

827
01:00:26,349 --> 01:00:28,934
- I do.
- Can't you let me hold onto some pride?

828
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:30,978
I lost all mine with you.

829
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:34,523
All right, I'll tell you.

830
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:36,400
I was in love with her.

831
01:00:36,776 --> 01:00:38,444
Me, a prison guard.

832
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:40,905
It was for her I began to
work my way up.

833
01:00:40,988 --> 01:00:43,699
All I had was guts. I traded them for
money and influence.

834
01:00:43,783 --> 01:00:45,951
I got respect from everybody but her.

835
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:48,287
She did anything she could
to humiliate me.

836
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:50,623
She was always drunk,
flirting with other men.

837
01:00:50,706 --> 01:00:52,416
I tried to straighten her out.

838
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:55,252
I took her on a boat trip when
Grazzi had to go to Sicily.

839
01:00:55,294 --> 01:00:58,756
The day after we docked, she disappeared.
I spent months looking for her!

840
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:00,549
Where do you think she was?

841
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:02,593
Living in Grazzi's house.

842
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,804
He was a bigger man than me.

843
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:07,598
Now you know who Alicia is.

844
01:01:11,394 --> 01:01:14,897
Well, well, well. Good evening, Miss
Rita. How are you, how you been?

845
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:18,859
Lonely, Fred. Lonely... I'm between
shows, have till 12:00.

846
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:20,778
Mr. Diamond is out...

847
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:24,031
- Would you like to go up there
and wait for him? - Thanks.

848
01:01:24,365 --> 01:01:26,659
Tell me what he does with his evenings.

849
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:27,742
Work.

850
01:01:28,327 --> 01:01:31,080
- I'm gonna kill that guy.
- Don't you kill him.

851
01:01:31,122 --> 01:01:33,666
He pays rent right on the dot,
I'd miss him.

852
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:35,209
You and rne both.

853
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:51,475
Yeah?

854
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:54,270
No! No, I'm wide awake.

855
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:57,606
When do you want it done?

856
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:00,317
I understand.

857
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:08,576
- Mingo!
- What's the matter?

858
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:10,953
Mr. Brown wants an order filled tonight.

859
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,204
Who?

860
01:02:12,788 --> 01:02:13,873
Diamond.

861
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:35,436
It's open.

862
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:36,478
Go?

863
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:37,646
Go!

864
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:08,177
Leonard?

865
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,721
- Leonard!
- What, Sam? What?

866
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:13,974
Whatever you're thinking, drop it.
It won't bring her back.

867
01:03:15,434 --> 01:03:16,936
Saks Fifth Avenue.

868
01:03:18,354 --> 01:03:20,815
She came to see me in her best shoes.

869
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,610
I'll call Peterson, he'll put every
available man on it.

870
01:03:24,693 --> 01:03:26,487
Never mind, Sam.

871
01:03:26,737 --> 01:03:28,572
I said never mind!

872
01:03:30,115 --> 01:03:32,785
We don't have to check bullets
or fingerprints.

873
01:03:32,952 --> 01:03:36,622
This room a name written all
over it... Brown! Brown!

874
01:03:37,456 --> 01:03:41,252
He wanted to kill me, he got tired
of waiting. Well, so have I.

875
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:44,171
- What are you gonna do? - Close the case.
- I know how you feel.

876
01:03:44,213 --> 01:03:47,716
- Nobody knows how another person feels!
- No matter, sit down!

877
01:04:11,198 --> 01:04:12,825
Do me a favor...

878
01:04:12,992 --> 01:04:14,577
take off your gun.

879
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,708
I treated her like a pair of gloves.

880
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:25,045
If I was cold... I called her up.

881
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,594
Don't blame yourself, you'll go crazy.

882
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,571
I saw the papers this morning.

883
01:04:50,613 --> 01:04:51,989
I'm sorry.

884
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:55,618
- Terribly, terribly sorry.
- Why, that it wasn't me?

885
01:04:56,452 --> 01:04:58,537
Say what you came to say.

886
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:04,418
- I left Mr. Brown.
- You're a little late.

887
01:05:05,461 --> 01:05:07,880
Brown killed the girl in your apartment.

888
01:05:07,922 --> 01:05:10,049
- His men did it.
- Can you prove it'?

889
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,428
No, I... - Can you prove that Fante and
Mingo did it? That he ordered them to?

890
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:15,930
No.

891
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,057
Sit down.

892
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:23,228
Does he know you're gone?

893
01:05:23,604 --> 01:05:24,855
He will.

894
01:05:25,397 --> 01:05:27,942
- I opened his private vault.
- Why?

895
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:32,279
- I wanted to help you if I could.
- What does he keep in the vault?

896
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:33,906
Guns and money.

897
01:05:33,948 --> 01:05:37,117
It's no crime to have money, or even to
have a gun, only to use it.

898
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:39,036
- I saw something else.
- What?

899
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,996
Something about Alicia.

900
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:44,416
- Can you prove that she was murdered?
- No.

901
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,961
I can prove that she's alive.

902
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,546
What are you talking about?

903
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,508
She's living in Sicily, with Grazzi.

904
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,718
That's impossible.

905
01:05:55,094 --> 01:05:57,012
She sent this to Brown.

906
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:59,139
It's Alicia all right.

907
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:02,017
Years older than her photograph
taken on the boat.

908
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,894
Then she must be ali...

909
01:06:05,604 --> 01:06:08,190
This photo was never taken in Sicily.

910
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:10,734
There's snow on the ground.

911
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:18,409
Yeah, it's the same girl all right.

912
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:21,078
She's sure changed since
the other picture.

913
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,038
- Could that be a fake?
- No, Sir.

914
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,332
This was made with an ordinary,
wide-angle lens.

915
01:06:25,374 --> 01:06:27,542
- Now, judging from the scope...
- Never mind all that.

916
01:06:27,543 --> 01:06:30,671
- Can you tell me when the picture was taken?
- The original was printed on Varagan paper.

917
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:34,091
- Well, what does that mean?
- It wasn't on the market till a year and a half ago.

918
01:06:34,133 --> 01:06:35,175
Frank!

919
01:06:35,217 --> 01:06:38,762
See the highway marker through the fence,
can you tell me what this? Identify it'?

920
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:42,224
- No, I can't but I'll check it right away for you.
- Will you do it quickly, please?

921
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,768
- Leonard. - Yeah?
- Alicia's alive.

922
01:06:44,977 --> 01:06:49,273
- If there's no murder, there's no case.
- We may have an even stronger case.

923
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,859
I've been in touch with our overseas
military intelligence.

924
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:54,695
They've been looking for Grazzi
for years, not to be found!

925
01:06:54,737 --> 01:06:56,989
And, there's no record that he
ever got to Sicily.

926
01:06:57,031 --> 01:06:58,782
What about Bettini's story?

927
01:06:58,824 --> 01:07:01,660
Bettini was right about a murder
taking place on the boat.

928
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:04,538
He was just wrong about the
identity of the victim.

929
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,749
Wait a minute. Spell that out.

930
01:07:07,082 --> 01:07:10,335
Well, I... I've been looking for
the wrong murder.

931
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,963
Brown didn't kill his wife!

932
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:15,090
He killed his boss, Grazzi.

933
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:17,676
And, that's why our intelligence
couldn't find him.

934
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,805
Grazzi is at the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean tied to an anchor!

935
01:07:23,015 --> 01:07:24,933
That's a beautiful theory, Leonard.

936
01:07:24,975 --> 01:07:26,060
Beautiful!

937
01:07:26,435 --> 01:07:28,312
Except for one small item.

938
01:07:28,771 --> 01:07:31,023
You can't prove it, you have no witness.

939
01:07:31,106 --> 01:07:33,150
Oh, you got it, Frank? Let's see it.

940
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:37,613
- State highway marker 225A.
- 225A, do you know where that is?

941
01:07:37,696 --> 01:07:39,406
I can find it in two hours.

942
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,826
It's a one-lane gravel road that curves
west from the coast highway.

943
01:08:07,893 --> 01:08:10,104
I don't know why you've
come to me, Officer.

944
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:12,564
My name is Anna Lee Jackson.

945
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:15,359
Are you sure you never took
an ocean voyage?

946
01:08:15,442 --> 01:08:17,903
Well, ifl had I certainly
would've remembered.

947
01:08:19,154 --> 01:08:21,240
You really have a way with flowers.

948
01:08:21,365 --> 01:08:23,575
- Thank you.
- What are these?

949
01:08:23,617 --> 01:08:25,119
These are Stalk.

950
01:08:25,953 --> 01:08:28,413
Beautiful, all of them.
How do you do it?

951
01:08:28,622 --> 01:08:30,582
Oh, you have to love them.

952
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,793
They know the difference.

953
01:08:33,836 --> 01:08:35,879
- Oh, my goodness!
- What is it?

954
01:08:36,672 --> 01:08:38,048
A caterpillar.

955
01:08:38,757 --> 01:08:40,259
Eating the buds.

956
01:08:41,135 --> 01:08:44,555
- Well, why didn't you kill it?
- Oh, I couldn't kill anything.

957
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:47,266
I can't even cut these flowers.

958
01:08:47,766 --> 01:08:51,478
If people want to see them they've got
to come here where they're alive.

959
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,520
Not...

960
01:08:52,688 --> 01:08:55,399
withering and... dying in a vase.

961
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,778
- You feel that pretty strongly, don't you?
- Oh, yes I do.

962
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:02,656
I can tell you why you feel that way.

963
01:09:02,865 --> 01:09:04,074
Can you?

964
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:07,703
Because you saw your husband
murder a man named Grazzi.

965
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:11,123
I'll spell the name for you:
G-R-A-Z-Z-I. Grazzi.

966
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:16,628
I have a photograph of you...
taken seven years ago.

967
01:09:16,837 --> 01:09:18,630
You can have it if you like?

968
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:24,887
The men are old friends of yours,
one alive, the other dead.

969
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:34,438
Now, listen to me, Alicia.

970
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:37,649
Brown, unfortunately,
is not a caterpillar.

971
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:40,527
He doesn't eat flowers,
he devours people.

972
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:44,156
I had a friend, a... girl,

973
01:09:44,406 --> 01:09:45,991
24 years old.

974
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:49,870
She was murdered last night.
Brown thought he was killing me.

975
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:52,331
- He didn't even know her name.
- I don't hear anymore! Please!

976
01:09:52,372 --> 01:09:54,875
Please, I'm sick!
Can't you see I'm sick?

977
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,252
You're sick all right, Alicia.

978
01:09:57,294 --> 01:10:01,840
Sick with fright. Now you're in our
custody, you have nothing more to fear.

979
01:10:02,174 --> 01:10:05,552
You know that, because
you're perfectly sane.

980
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,181
I'd rather be...

981
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:11,934
insane and alive.

982
01:10:13,769 --> 01:10:15,229
Then sane...

983
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:17,564
and dead.

984
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,945
- It hurts.
- If you can move it, it's not broken.

985
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,780
- But, it hurts!
- Take a drink.

986
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,366
- I took a drink, it still hurts.
- Take another drink.

987
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:29,785
Fante, I'm trying to tell you,
you don't understa...

988
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,836
- Well?
- I got news, big news.

989
01:10:40,254 --> 01:10:41,630
Brown is finished.

990
01:10:41,672 --> 01:10:44,967
The police found Alicia, she's gonna
spill her guts to the grand jury.

991
01:10:46,551 --> 01:10:49,388
I said Brown's washed up!
Finished! Off the map.

992
01:10:49,429 --> 01:10:53,183
- You say. That means nothing!
- When Grazzi says, that's something.

993
01:10:53,267 --> 01:10:55,143
There ain't no Grazzi, he's dead!

994
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:57,145
- Since when?
- Seven years.

995
01:10:57,521 --> 01:10:58,981
I've seen cablegrams.

996
01:10:59,022 --> 01:11:01,483
Brown sent those cablegrams.
Brown killed him.

997
01:11:01,566 --> 01:11:04,027
Brown kept him alive to
keep the boys in line.

998
01:11:04,069 --> 01:11:07,364
Why haven't you guys been chaperoning
this Miss Lowell dame?

999
01:11:07,447 --> 01:11:10,367
You want to know where she is?
She's helping the police.

1000
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,995
Seems like Mr. Brown has lost his charm.

1001
01:11:14,997 --> 01:11:16,832
What would you suggest?

1002
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,959
Kill him.

1003
01:11:24,548 --> 01:11:26,717
Kill him tonight, not tomorrow.

1004
01:11:26,758 --> 01:11:28,635
Mr. Brown will be dead soon enough.

1005
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,471
The boys will take care of him for
his long double-cross.

1006
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:33,473
But, if we do it now, fast...

1007
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:36,059
that would save a lot of people
a lot of trouble.

1008
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:38,478
We'll be in more solid than ever.

1009
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:42,274
Instead of running around for Brown and
wet-nursing all his crazy dames,

1010
01:11:42,316 --> 01:11:44,526
I'm gonna show you two guys
how to be men.

1011
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:46,194
Start all over.

1012
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:47,863
Slower this time.

1013
01:12:17,184 --> 01:12:18,602
We're early.

1014
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:20,729
They said they'd land at 1:00 a.m.

1015
01:12:20,812 --> 01:12:23,940
I didn't want to be late, them coming
all the way from Denver.

1016
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:26,651
Strange they sent word through you
instead of the regular way.

1017
01:12:26,693 --> 01:12:28,820
This isn't regular, this is special.

1018
01:12:28,904 --> 01:12:31,823
They said they wanted 200 grand
in small bills.

1019
01:12:31,907 --> 01:12:34,076
I got it right here,
but what's the pitch?

1020
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,661
- Denver's usually a quiet spot.
- I don't know.

1021
01:12:36,745 --> 01:12:39,039
I asked them, but they wouldn't
tell me on the phone.

1022
01:12:39,122 --> 01:12:40,749
Didn't they give any reason?

1023
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:41,851
No.

1024
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,585
What do you think it is?

1025
01:12:44,086 --> 01:12:45,837
We'll know soon enough.

1026
01:12:48,757 --> 01:12:51,259
Well, Mr. Brown, how do you feel now?

1027
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,011
Not so big, huh?

1028
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:56,598
You took my job, you took my hotel.

1029
01:12:56,681 --> 01:12:59,226
You thought you could push
me right of the earth.

1030
01:12:59,309 --> 01:13:02,562
You punk! You accountant,
you bookkeeper.

1031
01:13:03,313 --> 01:13:06,358
Let him have it. Let him have
it now, right now!

1032
01:13:11,321 --> 01:13:12,739
Wait a minute!

1033
01:13:12,906 --> 01:13:15,200
What's the matter, you
fellas gone loony?

1034
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,371
I'm McClure. Can't you see me?
This is McClure!

1035
01:13:20,705 --> 01:13:22,999
Don't do it, Mango! I'll give you dough!

1036
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:26,128
All the dough I got! 10,000!
20,000! Everything!

1037
01:13:26,545 --> 01:13:28,672
No, Fante! Don't do it!

1038
01:13:29,047 --> 01:13:30,257
Mr. Brown!

1039
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:31,466
Mr. Brown!

1040
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:38,807
Mr. Brown, tell them not to do it!

1041
01:13:38,849 --> 01:13:42,102
I'll do anything you want, I'll go away!
You'll never see me again!

1042
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:45,647
Please, Mr. Brown! Don'tjust stand
there and let 'em kill me!

1043
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:47,232
Please, Mr. Brown.

1044
01:13:47,274 --> 01:13:50,026
I don't want to die, tell 'em!
Please tell 'em.

1045
01:14:01,663 --> 01:14:03,665
I feel sorry for you, Joe.

1046
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:05,459
So, I'm gonna do you a favor.

1047
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,544
You won't hear the bullets.

1048
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:29,441
- Sam.
- Yeah?

1049
01:14:29,483 --> 01:14:32,319
Tell the Captain I finished
my interrogation.

1050
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:45,373
Miss Lowell.

1051
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,636
Are you a policewoman?

1052
01:14:58,053 --> 01:14:59,054
No.

1053
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:00,972
Who are you?

1054
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,351
My... name is Susan Lowell. I'm...

1055
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:06,895
a witness against Mr. Brown.

1056
01:15:06,937 --> 01:15:08,230
I'm not.

1057
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:13,026
I can't do it!

1058
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,904
Haven't I humiliated myself enough?

1059
01:15:16,071 --> 01:15:18,782
No one's done enough
while he's still free.

1060
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:21,493
I've been...

1061
01:15:21,743 --> 01:15:23,411
Mr. Brown's girl...

1062
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,747
for the past four years.

1063
01:15:26,915 --> 01:15:30,377
He met lots of girls. They were
all crazy about him.

1064
01:15:30,418 --> 01:15:32,087
I'm not proud of it.

1065
01:15:32,462 --> 01:15:34,714
Then, Why'd you stay four years?

1066
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,717
- Why'd you start?
- I don't know!

1067
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:40,679
No, that's not true. I...
I was told, but...

1068
01:15:41,721 --> 01:15:43,557
I just wouldn't believe.

1069
01:15:43,848 --> 01:15:45,767
Take a look at her, Alicia.

1070
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:49,896
Take a good luck, you can see
yourself, ten years ago.

1071
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:54,943
If you had only spoken up then how
different... your life would have been.

1072
01:15:56,278 --> 01:15:58,238
Because he killed you.

1073
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:00,657
He buried you alive.

1074
01:16:00,865 --> 01:16:02,534
Because he's a murderer.

1075
01:16:02,617 --> 01:16:04,744
That's all he is, a murderer.

1076
01:16:04,786 --> 01:16:06,121
Don't wanna hear it.

1077
01:16:06,204 --> 01:16:08,748
He killed Grazzi, didn't he?
You saw him do it, didn't you?

1078
01:16:08,832 --> 01:16:10,417
I never said I did!

1079
01:16:12,127 --> 01:16:13,378
Besides...

1080
01:16:13,461 --> 01:16:15,463
Grazzi deserved to die.

1081
01:16:15,547 --> 01:16:20,010
And, what about the girl he had killed three
days ago? Did she deserve to die too?

1082
01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:26,891
You remember the girl. The girl I told you
about at the sanitarium. You remember!

1083
01:16:26,933 --> 01:16:30,353
- No, I don't!
- Then I'll refresh your memory. This girl!

1084
01:16:31,062 --> 01:16:34,065
Someone he didn't know,
never met, never saw.

1085
01:16:34,274 --> 01:16:37,027
They took eleven bullets from her body.

1086
01:16:37,444 --> 01:16:40,405
The following morning Miss Lowell
had breakfast with him.

1087
01:16:40,447 --> 01:16:44,034
He ordered bacon and two eggs.
Tell her, Susan!

1088
01:16:44,075 --> 01:16:47,662
Tell her how he ate his bacon and eggs
while he looked at the papers!

1089
01:16:47,746 --> 01:16:50,957
And saw the body of this girl
lying in the morgue.

1090
01:16:53,627 --> 01:16:55,712
I'll tell whatever I know.

1091
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,217
We'll take her to the DA's office
for a statement.

1092
01:17:01,926 --> 01:17:03,178
Mrs. Brown.

1093
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:20,445
Captain. Captain, this is
Mr. Malloy, an attorney.

1094
01:17:20,487 --> 01:17:23,782
I have a writ of habeas corpus
for a Mrs. Alicia Brown.

1095
01:17:23,823 --> 01:17:27,494
We have no Mrs. Brown here.
This is Mrs. Anna Lee Jackson.

1096
01:17:31,623 --> 01:17:33,041
Hello, Alicia.

1097
01:17:56,314 --> 01:17:58,316
It's no use, we can't use her.

1098
01:17:58,483 --> 01:18:02,153
Well, not every case ends with a
promotion, your name in the papers.

1099
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:08,159
McClure's body has been found in
the river, shot full of holes.

1100
01:18:09,202 --> 01:18:12,622
This is an act of panic!
Mr. Brown is cracking.

1101
01:18:12,997 --> 01:18:16,251
Sam, take the headquarters squad,
pick up Fante and Mingo.

1102
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:19,629
First Dreyer, Rita, McClure...

1103
01:18:19,671 --> 01:18:22,757
They can't have alibis that'll
stick for three murders!

1104
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:25,301
Come on, Mingo, lay off that stuff.

1105
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:30,390
Mingo, lay off of that stuff I told you!

1106
01:18:36,146 --> 01:18:37,772
Gotta eat something.

1107
01:18:39,065 --> 01:18:41,067
I can't swallow anymore salami.

1108
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,986
That's all we've got.

1109
01:18:43,445 --> 01:18:47,240
Where is Brown, when's he coming?
How long we gonna stay here?

1110
01:18:47,782 --> 01:18:49,909
We've been here two days, that's all.

1111
01:18:50,577 --> 01:18:53,163
I... Ijust can't take it anymore, Fante.

1112
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:58,168
I think my thumb's got an infection,
it keeps aching worse than a sore tooth.

1113
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:02,255
- If the cops catch us it'll ache worse.
- Cops! What can they prove?

1114
01:19:02,881 --> 01:19:04,924
They don't have to prove a thing.

1115
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:08,553
They got three warrants out for us,
indictments for three murders.

1116
01:19:08,636 --> 01:19:11,473
So, let them indict,
they still can't prove...

1117
01:19:13,516 --> 01:19:14,851
Can they?

1118
01:19:17,604 --> 01:19:20,690
You know how long it would take
for three murder trials?

1119
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:24,527
We'd be in jail for three years.
Now relax.

1120
01:19:24,569 --> 01:19:28,364
Brown will get us out of town until the
heat blows out, then we can come back.

1121
01:19:28,406 --> 01:19:31,451
- How do we know we're safe here?
- It's the safest place in the world.

1122
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:35,872
Grazzi built this place in prohibition days,
not even the bellhops know it's here.

1123
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:38,208
I'm sour on this town, Fante.

1124
01:19:40,126 --> 01:19:42,837
When we get out, let's never come back.

1125
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:47,258
What I'm worried about is getting
out of this hotel,

1126
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:49,636
the cops will be looking for
us in every closet.

1127
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:01,147
- We thought you'd never come!
- Take it easy, boys.

1128
01:20:02,315 --> 01:20:04,442
Look, it's now four in the afternoon.

1129
01:20:04,484 --> 01:20:08,613
At 5:30 tomorrow morning the cops change
shifts in the alley, I'll come for you then.

1130
01:20:08,655 --> 01:20:11,908
- Did you get us a car? - Everything's
arranged. Just keep your heads and wait.

1131
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:14,869
- I brought you some food.
- (?) go crazy.

1132
01:20:14,953 --> 01:20:16,663
You've both been good boys.

1133
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:20,291
There's enough money here to keep care
of you for a long time. Divide it even

1134
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:22,168
and don't fight over it.

1135
01:20:25,296 --> 01:20:28,341
- How much you think?
- Mr. Brown's a generous man.

1136
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:30,760
- I'll tell ya after I count it.
- Give it here.

1137
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,744
The police are downstairs.

1138
01:20:59,497 --> 01:21:01,249
Bring me another bottle.

1139
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,960
Mingo is still alive.

1140
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:11,134
- He can't be.
- He is.

1141
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:32,071
I don't want to go up there again.

1142
01:21:32,155 --> 01:21:34,824
There are things in Brown's vault
you've got to identify.

1143
01:21:50,798 --> 01:21:54,093
Who did this, Mingo? Mingo!
Who did this to you?

1144
01:21:54,177 --> 01:21:55,178
Nobody.

1145
01:21:55,219 --> 01:21:58,973
Who killed a girl named Rita? Who killed
McClure? Who paid you to do it'?

1146
01:21:59,057 --> 01:22:00,099
Nobody.

1147
01:22:00,183 --> 01:22:02,602
You got third degree burns,
Mingo. You're dying.

1148
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:04,145
I ain't gonna die.

1149
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:06,314
Not you...

1150
01:22:08,942 --> 01:22:10,443
and not Fante?

1151
01:22:15,657 --> 01:22:17,033
Fante...

1152
01:22:19,118 --> 01:22:21,245
Don't leave me Fante...

1153
01:22:21,329 --> 01:22:24,082
He's dead. Murdered, by whoever
tried to kill you.

1154
01:22:24,165 --> 01:22:27,251
We haven't got much time, Mingo.
Tell us who did it! Do it for Fante!

1155
01:22:27,335 --> 01:22:29,253
He shouldn't of done it...

1156
01:22:29,754 --> 01:22:31,839
Fante was my friend...

1157
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:36,427
All right...

1158
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:37,887
I'll tell you.

1159
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:40,515
But not for you...

1160
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:45,311
We played square with him,
he shouldn't have hurt Fante.

1161
01:22:45,353 --> 01:22:48,564
We haven't got much time, Mingo. Who
did it? Who killed the girl in my room?

1162
01:22:48,648 --> 01:22:50,650
Who paid you to do it?

1163
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:54,654
Mr. Brown.

1164
01:22:55,863 --> 01:22:57,448
Mr. Brown.

1165
01:22:58,324 --> 01:23:00,076
- Leonard.
- What?

1166
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,870
Sam's been hurt. Shot!

1167
01:23:03,538 --> 01:23:06,916
- What? Where... where is he?
- In the hospital, he'll be all right.

1168
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,418
But Leonard...

1169
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:10,044
Susan's gone.

1170
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:19,053
Larry. Get his statement, signed.

1171
01:23:21,305 --> 01:23:23,891
A man like Brown would have a plan.

1172
01:23:23,933 --> 01:23:26,144
Where would he go to make a getaway?

1173
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,980
You're a policeman, you find him.

1174
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:32,400
He's not alone, he's got Susan
Lowell with him.

1175
01:23:32,483 --> 01:23:34,944
I wouldn't raise a finger
to help that girl.

1176
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:39,115
- Let her go through what I've been
through. - She never hurt you, Alicia.

1177
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:41,784
He's the one who put you away,
why take it out on her?

1178
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:43,286
Because I hate her.

1179
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:46,289
Her and every other woman who ever
had anything to do with him

1180
01:23:47,331 --> 01:23:49,751
What have I done to you,
why do you hate me?

1181
01:23:49,834 --> 01:23:51,127
Oh, I don't!

1182
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:54,714
- I must get...
- Then help me. Help me!

1183
01:23:54,756 --> 01:23:57,884
- Tell me where to find him.
- I've got to get back to my flowers.

1184
01:23:57,967 --> 01:24:00,428
I'm sure nobody's taken care of them.

1185
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:09,562
Lieutenant.

1186
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,611
I don't want to help you...

1187
01:24:17,528 --> 01:24:18,696
I don't.

1188
01:24:19,906 --> 01:24:21,199
But, I Will.

1189
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:28,289
What's keeping that plane? It was
supposed to be here an hour ago.

1190
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:32,085
I've kept that stupid pilot on my payroll
for years, just for a spot like this.

1191
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:33,836
Why doesn't he come?

1192
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,175
Don't try that again.

1193
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,681
- I want to be seen.
- Don't try that again!

1194
01:24:48,559 --> 01:24:50,269
Why doesn't he come?

1195
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,981
I got everything all figured out.
Top to bottom, smooth as silk!

1196
01:24:54,565 --> 01:24:56,567
Everything's falling apart!

1197
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:59,320
You can't trust nobody! Nothing!

1198
01:25:32,812 --> 01:25:34,647
Come on out, Brown!

1199
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:56,294
You can't get away, Brown!

1200
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:38,294
You can't get away, drop the gun.

1201
01:26:38,377 --> 01:26:39,795
Come and get it!

1202
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:47,845
Come on!

1203
01:26:48,346 --> 01:26:50,640
I'm taking you to jail, Mr. Brown.
- No you're not!

1204
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:53,309
You're not taking me to jail!
You'll have to kill me first!

1205
01:26:53,392 --> 01:26:55,937
Go ahead, shoot! Go ahead.
Kill me, Copper! Kill me!

1206
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:59,398
- Go ahead! Kill me! Kill me!
- Let's go... Hoodlum.

1207
01:27:01,734 --> 01:27:02,902
Let go!

1208
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,820
I won't go to jail!

1209
01:27:05,029 --> 01:27:06,239
I won't!

1210
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:07,615
Shooﬂ
