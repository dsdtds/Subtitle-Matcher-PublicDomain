00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,488
There you are Mrs. Ladybug.

3
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,467
Orange blossom with honeysuckle icing.

4
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,814
Will there be anything else now.

5
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:59,545
No that's all. Thank you Mr. Bumble.

6
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,693
Why where's Honey tonight?

7
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,105
Honey.

8
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:06,630
Yes dad.

9
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:10,801
Come on out here and show
Mrs. Ladybug your new dress.

10
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:14,667
Good evening Mrs. Ladybug.

11
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:19,481
Well now...

12
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,833
If you don't look prettier
than a ruffled petunia.

13
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:26,155
You know... Hoppity's coming back.

14
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,230
Well for daisy's sakes.

15
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,004
You don't say.

16
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:34,300
My you've changed a lot
since he saw you last.

17
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,085
For the better.

18
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:41,257
I'm afraid he'll find a lot
of other things changed too.

19
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,781
For the worst!

20
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:45,765
Those human ones...

21
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,456
Those human ones!

22
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:51,138
Why the ways they've taken a
tramping through the Lowlands.

23
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,749
It's getting so your life
ain't worth a sunflower seed.

24
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:54,712
Anymore.

25
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:58,039
One never knows who's gonna get it next.

26
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,501
Mrs. Ladybug.

27
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,397
Mrs. Laaaadybug.

28
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:03,761
Mrs. Ladybug.

29
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,657
Mrs. Ladybug, Ladybug.

30
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,062
Fly away home. Your house!

31
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:08,894
My house!

32
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:09,799
My house?

33
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:11,777
Oh...

34
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,400
Oh..

35
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,476
Ohhh!

36
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,778
It's the humans ones!

37
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,501
The humans ones are always
getting into something!

38
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:30,761
Rabble-rousers.

39
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,868
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk. Its a goner.

40
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,137
What'll we do?

41
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,027
There's nothing to do, we're doomed
to go, n' don't forget I told you so.

42
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,857
It's that fence!

43
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:49,116
Yes, Jeepers Creepers.

44
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,775
For once your right!

45
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:54,927
At this rate the human one's will
trample us off the face of the ground.

46
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:59,168
If anything happened to the Honey Shop.

47
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,889
Come on Smack, we gotta'
tell the boss about this.

48
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,390
Yeah, dis' ought to be
mighty inturresting to him.

49
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:09,865
I tink' your right.

50
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:27,756
Yes?

51
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,021
♪ Who is it? ♪

52
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,674
It's us boss.

53
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:34,519
Swat the fly. And Smack the mosquito.

54
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:36,253
Shhh!

55
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:38,253
Nitwits, imbeciles.

56
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,656
What if somebody should see you here.

57
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,243
Now begone before I bash
your bone head skulls!

58
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,389
Yeah, but Mr. Beetul.

59
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:50,476
You told us to wise you up when
there was trouble in the Lowlands.

60
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,262
And concerning Mr. Bumble and Honey.

61
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:58,172
Trouble? Ah... what sort of trouble?

62
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,933
From the humans ones boss.
There was a fire.

63
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,462
Mrs. Ladybug's house.

64
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:04,512
And a lota' houses was busted down.

65
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:06,905
And they was beefing and squawking.

66
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:08,105
And saying,

67
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:11,256
"What in the wings is
the world a-coming to?"

68
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:14,042
We all be extorminated.

69
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,090
And Mr. Bumble says,

70
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:18,892
Bumble?

71
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,152
Yeah, and he says,

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,241
"Me poor daughter..."

73
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:25,569
"If anything should
happen to me Honey Shop."

74
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,813
Very interesting.

75
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,409
Very.

76
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,110
You know Swat,

77
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:35,806
the boss ain't no chump.

78
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,158
He grabs off all this property up here

79
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:42,066
where the human ones don't
never come through.

80
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,290
Sure he's plenty smart.

81
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:48,254
Full of larceny, full of larceny.

82
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,277
Very interesting.

83
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:04,046
Good evening dear friends.

84
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:09,704
I hurried right down to offer poor
dear Mrs. Ladybug my condolences.

85
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,588
Thank you Mr. Beetle.

86
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,331
Oh, um...

87
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:18,116
Most fortunate it wasn't
your Honey Shop that burned.

88
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,394
Eh Bumble?

89
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:21,021
Oh and um...

90
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,832
Of course you realise that

91
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,059
this sort of thing couldn't possibly occur

92
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:27,063
up there on my estate.

93
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,692
No human one ever intrudes up there.

94
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:34,390
I guess most of us are like
to feel safe and secure.

95
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,908
That's just the point
Bumble, just the point.

96
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:42,292
Merely reconsider my offer of
marriage to your charming daughter

97
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:46,569
and we'll all three live up there
just as snug as three bugs in a rug.

98
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:49,070
Now what do you say to that Bumble eh?

99
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:56,276
Well I'm sorry sir but it's
just like I said before.

100
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,464
It's my daughters right to listen
to what her little heart says.

101
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,486
And it just don't seem to say, Beetle.

102
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,560
I guess maybe you haven't
just got "oomph" Mr. Beetle.

103
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,583
Anyway Hoppity's coming back.

104
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:15,346
Hoppity humph!

105
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,946
Bumble your a nincompoop

106
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:20,918
I warn you,

107
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,074
your walking right into trouble.

108
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,785
I'll sue somebody for this.

109
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:32,768
Swat!

110
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,648
Smack!

111
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:34,625
Help!

112
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:37,809
One,

113
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:38,599
two,

114
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,956

115
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,754
♪ La la la la la-la. ♪

116
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,792

118
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,276
And if you have nothing further to do,

119
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:54,367
straighten that out!

120
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,092
Hoppity's coming back.

121
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:11,918
Hay! Gee-wees!

122
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,817
The human ones never
stepped in there before.

123
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,531
Jumping Johnny jump ups.

124
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,661
What's going on around here?

125
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:37,558
It's Hoppity!

126
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,601
Hi ya' Hoppity.

127
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,079
Hello everybody, hello.

128
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:42,332
Welcome back Hoppity.

129
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:46,587
Well, well Hoppity my boy.

130
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:47,588
It's nice to see ya'.

131
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,931
Ah gee, it's nice to see you too.

132
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:02,886
Hello Hoppity.

133
00:11:03,312 --> 00:11:04,066
Honey.

134
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:06,004
Ah, gee-wees.

135
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,435
Well, look who's here.

136
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:10,823
Little Buzz.

137
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:15,305
Look Hoppity, I'm a Bee Scout now.

138
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,551
I'm a Bee Scout.

139
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,920
So I'll grow up to be brave like you.

140
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:22,096
Bee Scout Buzz, I salute you.

141
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:27,326
A Bee Scout must behave.
A Bee Scout must be brave.

142
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,427
A Bee Scout must be prepared.

143
00:11:37,582 --> 00:11:38,582
Hoppity!

144
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:40,211
Bah!

145
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,047
Hay boss! Look out!

146
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,497
Now look at whatcha' done you needle nose!

147
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,028
Why don't you keep your
big nose out if stuff...

148
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:05,077
Quiet!

149
00:12:05,498 --> 00:12:09,196
But boss, the smoke stick was
heading right for the Honey Shop.

150
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,108
And you know what Bumble said about
"if anything should happen..."

151
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,109
Quiet!

152
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,605
Hum...

153
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Why you!

154
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:38,999
Get out of here!

155
00:12:55,355 --> 00:13:00,393
As far as I'm concerned there's...
There's still no place like home.

156
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,057
Jumpin' buttercups!

157
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,256
They did it to us again!

158
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:20,538
Them human ones are always... will
somebody... don't stand there!

159
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,276
Help and do something about it!

160
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,855
Get that thing off my Honey Shop!

161
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,569
Tsk-tsk-tsk most unfortunate.

162
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:01,632
Well Bumble, don't say I didn't warn you.

163
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:27,615
And now you are homeless. Both of you.

164
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:31,469
Out in the street with no
shelter over your head

165
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:37,419
I've been robbed!

166
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:42,095

00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:02,703
Why it's an outrage.

332
00:31:02,805 --> 00:31:05,916
Why nobody's safe in their
own homes or out of them.

333
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,101
Gee-wees, how long has this been going on?

334
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,779
Ever since that big fence has been down.

335
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,632
The fence is down.

336
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:15,001
The humans come through.

337
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,901
There's only one thing that we can do.

338
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:18,840
We're in a groove, we gotta' move.

339
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:22,411
No you smooving. We're doomed to
go and don't forget I told you so.

340
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:25,741
But jeepers Mr. Creepers we gotta' move.

341
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:26,858
Where?!

342
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:27,941
Where?

343
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:30,059
Hoppity, there isn't anywhere

344
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:34,435
'cept that garden up next to the big
place where the human ones live.

345
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:36,378
Well, what's the matter with that?

346
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:37,403
Not for me.

347
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:37,942
Me neither.

348
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:38,585
.
Me neither.

349
00:31:38,776 --> 00:31:39,312
Me neither.

350
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:42,437
Well, all human ones aren't so bad.

351
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:44,509
I'm going up and look that place over.

352
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:47,961
Huh, it can't be much worse
than it is down here.

353
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, can't be any worse eh?

354
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:55,880
We'll fix that. Won't you boys.

355
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:18,692
Well Mr. Bumble, the garden ought
to be just over this wall.

356
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:19,946
Somewhere.

357
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:47,246
It's no use Hoppity.

358
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,236
You'll never get to that garden with

359
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,787
With a cripple old critter

360
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,725
with a gimpy wing like me

361
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:53,920
holding you back.

362
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:56,013
Mr. Bumble.

363
00:33:03,172 --> 00:33:04,680
Gee-wees!

364
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,671
Isn't it beautiful?

365
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:09,760
Yeah, it's pretty all right but

366
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:12,188
it's awful close to the big house.

367
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:14,501
What about those human ones?

368
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,248
I don't think you gotta worry about them.

369
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:21,105
Anybody that'll keep a garden
like this can't be so bad.

370
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:23,152
At least I don't think so.

371
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:25,633
Hay, hay Mr. Bumble.

372
00:33:25,783 --> 00:33:26,926
Look at this.

373
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:31,305
Just what the boss ordered.

374
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,434
Now you take the high guy

375
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:35,369
and I'll take the low guy.

376
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,534
What a place to live in!

377
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:09,701
Well, that's curtains for old man
Bumble and the long legged lug.

378
00:34:09,738 --> 00:34:12,833
Yeah, did we ever get
rid of them in a hurry.

379
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:13,780
Did we ever.

380
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:17,758
The boss ought a give us some
fancy sugar for this job.

381
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:24,749
We better be gettin' out of here Hoppity.

382
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,956
Why it's swell in here Mr. Bumble.

383
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:30,857
Solid and safe n' dry as a bone.

384
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,679
Over here Mr. Bumble.

385
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:43,912
In here.

386
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,380
Gimme your hand.

387
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:48,806
Oh Dick! There's a bee in here.

388
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:49,965
He'll drown!

389
00:34:50,594 --> 00:34:53,150
Ok girl scout. I'm a-coming to the rescue.

390
00:34:56,746 --> 00:35:00,445
Ok mister. Lets see what'll I do with you.

391
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:03,400
Say Mary, what'll I do with him?
Have him stuffed?

392
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:05,448
Ah Dick, don't be silly.

393
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,424
Here let me take that.

394
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:14,730
There you are Mr. Bumble.

395
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,571
This is where you belong.

396
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:18,264
Right out here in the garden.

397
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:23,775
See Mr. Bumble I told you we
belong here in the garden.

398
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:25,533
The lady human said so.

399
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:26,766
You heard her.

400
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:30,553
Gosh and she knew my name.

401
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,207
Called me, Mr. Bumble.

402
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:36,020
Oh, wait'll we spread the
good news in the Lowlands.

403
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,893
Oh! Well we'll move up here tonight.

404
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,534
So I close to him.

405
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:41,332
We grapples.

406
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,392
I'm up, he's down.

407
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,701
He's up, I'm down.

408
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:45,098
Up, down, down, up.

409
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:48,478
Then I definitely wraps his wings
around his kisser I deftly...

410
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,519
And I'm tying the grasshoppers legs
in a bow knot with a half hitch.

411
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:53,166
Bravo. Bravo.

412
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:55,388
And quick an you can say
Jack Robinson Crusoe.

413
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,520
We renders them unconscious.

414
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,268
Encompass megabus*
or out of the money.

415
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,557
Them?

416
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,398
Yeah-yeah, the grasshopper and Mr. Bumble.

417
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,657
Mr. Bumble? You don't say.

418
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:13,106
Uh. Ahem. Nitwits, bunglers. For shame.

419
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:17,191
To think, that you my trusted aids would
raise your cowardly hands in violence

420
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,923
agents a poor defenseless old nincompoop

421

_?_ like my dear friend Bumble.

422
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:26,563
Thereby depriving his only daughter

423
00:36:26,566 --> 00:36:27,877
of her father.

424
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,945

and console poor little orphan Honey.

425
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:49,612

426
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:51,735

Aw gee, it's beautiful.

Oh, Mr. Creeper, have you seen Hoppity?

492
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:47,091
Last I saw of him he was
headed towards the big fence.

493
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:48,201

How do you like it?

517
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:24,947
Oh Dick, it's a beautiful song.

518
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,118
Beautiful.

519
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,135
Well I hope the publishers agree with you,

520
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,391
to the tune of a nice fat check.

521
00:44:30,432 --> 00:44:32,495
I know they will and we can...

522
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:36,283
Meet the payments on this house
before they take it away from us.

523
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:38,805
Yes and we could fix up the lower garden

524
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:41,738
and the fence that's broken down
where the people walk through.

525
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:48,445
Of course its to to bad your young
friend had to fail so miserably, Bumble.

526
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:50,689
But under the circumstances,

527
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:53,840
wouldn't it be well to consider my
offer of marriage to your daughter.

528
00:44:53,907 --> 00:44:57,256
I suggest you discuss the matter
with her at once, Bumble.

529
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:58,182
Well I'll...

530
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:00,269
I... ah... ah...

531
00:45:00,272 --> 00:45:01,118
Achoo!

532
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:02,753
Mr. Bumble. Mr Bumble!

533
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:05,989
The human ones there going to
fix the fence and there also...

534
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:06,444
Oof.

535
00:45:06,447 --> 00:45:06,735
Oh!

536
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:07,631
Uh-oh!

537
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:10,980
Pardon me Mr. Beetle.

538
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:12,496
Oh now Hoppity.

539
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:13,629
Honest Mr. Bumble!

540
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:16,664
The lady human knows all
about that fence being down.

541
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,518
And those humans coming through.

542
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:21,751
And, and there gonna fix that fence
as soon as that check thing arrives.

543
00:45:21,754 --> 00:45:23,055
A check thing?

544
00:45:23,058 --> 00:45:23,968
Whats that?

545
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,836
Well, I heard them say it comes in a
letter. That the post man brings.

546
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,324
The post man?

547
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:30,453
What's the post man?

548
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:33,422
You know the human one with
the stripes on his legs

549
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:34,430
and a bag

550
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:36,081
and makes a noise like this.

551
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,302
Hurry up. Get going . And no slip ups.
Understand.

552
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:13,702
Why that's strange,

553
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,924
I thought I heard the mailman whistle.

554
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:21,212
Psst. Psst. Quick over here with it.

555
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,854
Over here with it.

556
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:34,772
In there. Out of sight.

557
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:35,779
Hurry!

558
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:05,596
Where's the letter?

559
00:47:05,627 --> 00:47:06,553
Such suspense.

560
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,548
Hoppity said, it would fix the fence.

561
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,481
The fence is down the humans come through.

562
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:12,293
Without the letter what'll we do?

563
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:15,838
Them that are bow are doomed to
go and don't forget I told you so.

564
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:17,474
Where is the letter that supposed to come.

565
00:47:17,506 --> 00:47:19,176
To stop the damage that's being done.

566
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:20,105
The fence is down.

567
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:21,113
The humans come through.

568
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:22,868
Where's the protection promised by you?

569
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,403
Where's the check thing you talked about?

570
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,181
That's supposed to keep the humans out.

571
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,208
The fence isn't fix. The
humans come through.

572
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:31,592
What Hoppity told us is all untrue.

573
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:36,329
Still no letter.

574
00:47:36,363 --> 00:47:38,609

No. No it isn't.

Oh Dick, the home you inherited
from your grandfather.

Yeah.

Along with its creaking old
mortgages and tax liens.

596
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:06,299
With the building covering their property.

597
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:09,229
Yeah boss, and on your property too. Huh?

598
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:10,587
Yes on my prop...

599
00:50:10,785 --> 00:50:12,182
My property!?!

600
00:50:12,185 --> 00:50:12,986
What!!!

601
00:50:13,025 --> 00:50:14,715
A building on my property!

602
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,951
Why I'll be ruined!!!

603
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:17,324
They can't do this to me.

604
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:20,200
- Well I'll... I'll...
- Is that bad boss?

605
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:21,486
That ain't so good?

606
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:24,203
Of course it isn't. My
property will be useless.

I'm sunk.

608
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:28,897
Then you might just as well give
your property away. Eh boss?

609
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,811
Give my property away.

610
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:31,962
No.

611
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:33,773
Hum...

612
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:35,331
Give it away.

613
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:36,793
Worthless.

614
00:50:37,813 --> 00:50:39,575
Give my property away.

615
00:50:39,757 --> 00:50:40,789
Yes!

616
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:42,011
Yes that's it!

617
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:46,247
Boys I'm about to make a
very generous gesture.

618
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,568
I am going to give my property to the
residents of the Lowlands community.

619
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:52,691
All my worthless property.

620
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,892
Your sure are a pa-lan-thro-pus boss.

621
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:57,858
You sure a palanthropus.

622
00:50:57,944 --> 00:51:00,150
Yes yes. Provided of course that

623
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:03,668
Miss. Honey Bee will accept
my offer of marriage.

624
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:14,761
Well if it isn't my old friend Hoppity.

625
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,473
How long have you been listening.

626
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:21,848
I-I mean standing there.

627
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:23,540
Just ling enough Mr. Beetle.

628
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,043
To overhear your whole cowardly scheme.

629
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:27,388
But your not gonna get away with it!

630
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:29,078
Cause I'm going down and
tell the Lowlanders

631
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,166
just what kind of an insect you are.

632
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,543
Oh, oh, oh, now don't be hasty young man.

633

Hay Smack, gimme a hand! Gimme a hand!

635
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:19,249
Put up your dukes! I'm gonna
bust you in the head!

636
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:21,362
I-I-I smack you!

637
00:52:21,857 --> 00:52:23,547
I'll mobileize you.

638
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:26,464
Home Jesse James.

639
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:28,805
And don't spare the horsefly's.

640
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:33,277
Huh, so you thought you could
outsmart C. Bagley Beetle ay.

641
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,154
Come on now, get up and fight like a man.

642
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:37,856
You double crossing beetle.

643
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:38,658
I'll...

644
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:41,301
Let go of me. Let me get my hands on him.

645
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:52,395
Why.. Wh..

646
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:54,968
Why that's the letter the
human ones were waiting for.

647
00:52:55,314 --> 00:52:56,845
To fix the fence.

648
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:58,355
Why you no good...

649
00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:01,650
That's right and looks what's inside.

650
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:03,173
Show him boys.

651
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:12,125
The check thing.

652
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:15,412
Hay! Let me out of here Beetle!

I know it's sort of silly
to come back here Dick.

792
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:02,102
But I just had to see what
they're doing to our old place.

793
01:06:02,185 --> 01:06:03,899
It's not our place anymore Mary.

01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:07,927
Oh Dick if only the publishers
had bought your song.

795
01:06:08,017 --> 01:06:09,676
I'm still hoping they will.

796
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:12,734
Wouldn't do much good now. It's to late.

Look! There it is!

798
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:17,735
Not much room for a house and garden here.

799
01:06:18,444 --> 01:06:21,785
Unless, you wanna live on the roof Mary.

800
01:06:21,788 --> 01:06:23,629
Oh we could Dick.

801
01:06:23,702 --> 01:06:26,194
We could build a cottage right here.

802
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:29,321
Our castle in the air.

803
01:06:29,324 --> 01:06:31,293
You could have your garden over here.

Up to the top.
