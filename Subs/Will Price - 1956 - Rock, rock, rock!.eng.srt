Hello?

186
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,201
It's for me.

187
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,837
Hello, Arabella.

188
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:50,904
What are you doing this
beautiful Saturday afternoon?

189
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,312
My mother's going shopping,

190
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:55,351
and I have to take care
of my little sister,

191
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:57,176
so I'm taking her to the movies.

192
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,487
You wanna go?

193
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,872
Gosh, I'd like to, but

194
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:04,767
I haven't got any M-O-N-E-Y.

195
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:06,001
What?

196
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:08,778
I used up my allowance for this week.

197
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,494
Oh, and I only have enough
for me and the B-R-A-T.

198
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:14,328
Mm, ow.

199
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:17,562
I tell ya what,

200
00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:18,974
I'll meet you on the terrace

201
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:21,041
at the country club in half an hour.

202
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,959
I have a plan, goodbye.

203
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,073
Father, give me a dollar, quick.

204
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,348
I have to go somewhere.

205
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,786
Okay, where do you have to go?

206
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,780
- To the movies.
- Oh.

207
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:38,440
Just a minute, young lady.

208
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,447
Stay right there.

209
00:12:40,448 --> 00:12:41,635
You mean to say you haven't

210
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,822
any money left from your allowance?

211
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,837
I didn't mean to tell you.

212
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,430
I just found out anyway.

213
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,560
I thought you were gonna keep a budget?

214
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,714
I did, but it didn't stay kept.

215
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:53,965
May I see it?

216
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:00,976
Uh-huh, ice cream, candy,

217
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,626
magazines, jukebox, forty cents,

218
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,442
E.P., sixty cents.

219
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,206
E.P., what's that?

220
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,956
Elvis Presley.

221
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,368
I still say, what's that?

222
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,202
Father, you're sweet

223
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:20,622
but so square.

224
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,846
I played Elvis Presley
records on the jukebox.

225
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,322
You already have an item down here

226
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:27,447
for playing the jukebox.

227
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,138
Why don't you put 'em both together?

228
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,436
Oh, it would look like
I spent too much money

229
00:13:31,437 --> 00:13:33,020
for just one thing.

230
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,857
That is dishonest.

231
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:40,349
Why, why in business, that's
like keeping two sets of books.

232
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,529
Is that bad?

233
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,572
Bad, it's illegal.

234
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,142
They put men in jail for that.

235
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,726
Oh, well, I have to
go meet Arabella now.

236
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:51,164
Thanks for the movie money.

237
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,903
Ah, you're welcome.

238
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:53,744
Now wait a minute.

239
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,327
Wait a minute, I didn't give...

240
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:58,120
Louise?

241
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,157
Louise?

242
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,017
What's the matter?

243
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:07,841
It's that daughter of yours.

244
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:10,199
Louise, there hasn't been one week

245
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,655
that she hasn't run out of her allowance.

246
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:16,385
She has no idea of the value of money.

247
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,469
Look at this, look, wait.

248
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:22,822
Look, bills, bills, nothing but bills.

249
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,770
Bills for clothes, bills for hats,

250
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,173
bills for all sorts of things.

251
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:29,020
Louise, we've gotta teach that girl

252
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:32,047
that money doesn't grow on fathers.

253
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,623
Now, first thing Monday morning,

254
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,054
I'm gonna go right down,

255
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:40,434
and cancel everyone of
our charge accounts.

256
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:43,353
But supposing she
needs some new clothes?

257
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:46,937
Nope, Dori's not
gonna get one new thing.

258
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,048
- Hi.
- Hi, Dori.

259
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:57,882
Hi, baby.

260
00:14:57,883 --> 00:14:58,888
Hello.

261
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,071
Where you waiting long?

262
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:01,598
Just a few minutes.

263
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,979
Ready to go?

264
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,897

265
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:07,477

00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,534
No.

267
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:09,659
You wanna a little doll?

268
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,493
- No.
- Don't you want

269
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,773
a storybook?
No.

270
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:13,429
- Do you want blocks?
- No.

271
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,733
Well then, what do you want?

272
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:18,693

537
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:38,609
Hmm, now that he's won the contest...

538
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:42,066
That Gloria will want
him more than ever.

539
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:45,557
And she's going to wear an
evening dress to the dance.

540
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:47,475
A blue evening dress.

541
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,474
And strapless.

542
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,485
There's just one thing to do.

543
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:57,403
I'll go down to the dress
shop tomorrow and get one, too.

544
00:34:04,532 --> 00:34:06,279
But please, Miss Silky.

545
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,657
Now girls, you'll just have to wait,

546
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:09,585
and I'll take care of you one at a time.

547
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,717
I have a customer in the
fitting room right now,

548
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:15,179
and I'll be out as soon
as I'm finished with her.

549
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,097
Come along.

550
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:18,747
You're next, aren't you?

551
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:20,081
Uh-huh.

552
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,857
It seems like everybody
wants an evening dress

553
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:28,284
since they know that Gloria
was going to get one.

554
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:31,769
Ah, I wish I had someone to
wear an evening dress for.

555
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,889
Oh, you'll meet him someday.

556
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,587
Just like that, you'll see.

557
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:38,304
I don't know.

558
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:41,472
Sometimes I think I'll never meet him.

559
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,071
Pardon me, could you tell
me where the proprietress is?

560
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:58,322
Miss Silky's in the back.

561
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:02,985
That's him.

562
00:35:02,986 --> 00:35:04,468
I know that's him.

563
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:05,672
Who?

564
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,454
My dream man.

565
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,305
His name is Melville.

566
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:10,646
Melville.

567
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:12,377
He's in my French class.

568
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:14,306
- He is?
- Uh-huh.

569
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:16,640
And I had to take Spanish.

570
00:35:20,855 --> 00:35:23,450
Oh, Melville, I'd like
you to meet Arabella.

571
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,289
Arabella, Melville.

572
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,123
Pleased to meet you.

573
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,516
Why didn't you say something?

574
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:32,934
He's beautiful.

575
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:36,440
Now Dori, what can I do for you?

576
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,107
I'd like to get an evening dress.

577
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:40,509
There's a nice one in
the window for $30.00.

578
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,473
The blue one.

579
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,457
And are you going to pay for it now?

580
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:47,972
Why, no, I'm going to
charge it like I always do.

581
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,728
And haven't you heard?

582
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:50,630
What?

583
00:35:50,631 --> 00:35:53,379
Your father closed your
charge account this morning.

584
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,721
He did?

585
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:55,722
I'm sorry.

586
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,153
Gosh.

587
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:11,937
Are the dishes done already?

588
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,438
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

589
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:18,946
Dori helped me.

590
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:20,603
Dori did?

591
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:22,051
That's strange.

592
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:24,357
I thought so, too.

593
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:26,221
She's taking an awfully long time.

594
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:28,722
I hope she's doing them right.

595
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:32,068
Dori doing the dishes?

596
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:49,916
Comfy?

597
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:51,793
Oh, sure.

598
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,641
Dori?

599
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,114
Yes, Father?

600
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,843
Is there something on your mind?

601
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,511
As a matter of fact, there is.

602
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:09,713
You see, Father, I went
to the dress shop today,

603
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:11,502
and Miss Silky told me that we didn't have

604
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:14,420
a charge account there anymore and,

605
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:20,221
well I've just have to get an
evening dress for the prom.

606
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:22,453
An evening dress, huh?

607
00:37:22,454 --> 00:37:26,287
I saw a beautiful one
there for only $30.00.

608
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:28,525
Only $30.00?

609
00:37:29,722 --> 00:37:31,401
Do you realize, young lady,

610
00:37:31,402 --> 00:37:34,962
how difficult it is to earn $30.00?

611
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:38,380
I know, but I need this dress so badly.

612
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:43,556
Well, when is this dance of yours?

613
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:45,643
Two weeks from Saturday.

614
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:48,201
When's the latest you
can order the dress?

615
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:51,952
Oh, about three days
before the dance, why?

616
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,395
Well, I'll tell ya what
I'm gonna do with ya.

617
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:58,710
Now the dress is $30.00, huh?

618
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,878
Alright, I'll give $15.00,

619
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:05,257
if you earn the other 15.

620
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:06,501
Oh.

621
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:09,850
Maybe when you find out how
difficult it is to earn money,

622
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:13,672
then you'll spend it a little less freely.

623
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,423
Where am I going to get $15.00?

624
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:32,325
Well, Dori Graham, how are you?

625
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:34,434
Very well, thank you, Mr. Bimble.

626
00:38:34,435 --> 00:38:35,685
Ah, sit down.

627
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,986
Well now Dori, how can I help you?

628
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,654
I'd like to borrow some money.

629
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:42,814
What?

630
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,731
Well, isn't that what banks are for?

631
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:47,482
Well, yes, true, but we don't lend money

632
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:50,724
without business references, collateral.

633
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:52,882
What's collateral?

634
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:55,955
Collateral, well that's
something that people pledge

635
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:58,846
that's worth as much as the
amount of money we lend them.

636
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,954
When someone puts money in your bank,

637
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,665
what do you do with it?

638
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:05,434
Well, I don't really know.

639
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:07,692
You mean to tell me, Mr. Bimble,

640
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,521
that you take people's money

641
00:39:09,522 --> 00:39:11,128
and don't know what you do with it?

642
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:12,947
Well, of course I
know what we do with it.

643
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:15,187
What I mean there is that I don't know

644
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:18,784
where any particular deposit goes.

645
00:39:18,785 --> 00:39:20,602
You mean, the deposits are all mixed up?

646
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:22,097
No, no, no.

647
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,831
They're kept in order by bookkeeping.

648
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:25,574
Double-entry bookkeeping.

649
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,150
You keep two sets of books?

650
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:30,651
I do not keep two sets, I...

651
00:39:31,993 --> 00:39:33,244
Oh, Dori Graham, let--

652
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,784
When depositors put money in your bank,

653
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:38,523
where do you get the
money to pay in interest?

654
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,221
Well, ah, the bank makes its money

655
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:45,055
by giving loans to responsible
people who have collateral,

656
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:49,330
and charging interest on the loans.

657
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:51,294
How much interest do you charge?

658
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:52,128
6%.

659
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,060
That's awfully high, isn't it?

660
00:39:58,445 --> 00:40:01,028
6% interest is standard.

661
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:03,392
- It is?
- Yes.

662
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,550
Seems awfully high to me.

663
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:12,300
Suppose some person came along,

664
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:15,468
and charged less interest than you do.

665
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:18,011
Well, I'd bet pretty soon,

666
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:22,444
they'd take all your business
away from you, wouldn't he?

667
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:25,663
Mr. Bimble, you've given me something

668
00:40:25,664 --> 00:40:28,164
more valuable than money.

669
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,276
You've given me knowledge.

670
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,110
Thank you, Mr. Bimble.

671
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:51,814
Arabella, how would you
like to be wallowing...

672
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,433
Arabella, how would you like
to be wallowing in money?

673
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:58,543
Huh?

674
00:40:58,544 --> 00:41:00,378
I just thought of the most wonderful way

675
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,674
to make money to pay for my evening dress.

676
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,522
I'm going to be a banker.

677
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:05,356
You?

678
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:09,081
Sure, I'm going to lend
money and get interest on it.

679
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:10,435
Where will you get the money?

680
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:12,593
That's where you can help me.

681
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:15,485
All I've got in the world is $15.00,

682
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,147
and that's in Mr. Bimble's bank.

683
00:41:17,148 --> 00:41:19,265
Oh, but that's terrible.

684
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:21,631
You'll have to get it out right away.

685
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:23,132
They're dishonest.

686
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:26,528
How do ya know?

687
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:29,190
They keep two sets of books

688
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:31,499
and that's a government offense.

689
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,513
My father told me so.

690
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:35,214
Why they can close the bank any minute,

691
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,910
and take them all off to jail.

692
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:41,457
Gosh, I'd better get my money out.

693
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,328
Then you can put it in my bank.

694
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,837
Oh, it will earn scads of interest.

695
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,464
Now, you go down and get your money

696
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:50,034
out of Mr. Bimble's bank right away.

697
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:51,953
But I have to go to class.

698
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:55,388
Which would you rather
be, ignorant or bankrupt?

699
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,677
That's a good question.

700
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:57,511
C'mon.

701
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:21,511
What's the matter?

702
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:23,146
Oh, it's nothing.

703
00:42:23,147 --> 00:42:25,340
I saw Melville again.

704
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,533
He spoke to me.

705
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:27,788
And?

706
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:31,399
I couldn't think of
anything to say back.

707
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,132
Well if he spoke to you,
he must be interested.

708
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,081
Maybe next time you'll
think of something to say.

709
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:39,499
I sure hope so.

710
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:43,574
Hey, kids, listen to me.

711
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:44,977
Knock it off.

712
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:47,061
Phil, go get the jukebox.

713
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,018
I got great news for ya.

714
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,162
After the television show,

715
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:59,385
I asked Alan Freed if he'd
come down to our prom.

716
00:42:59,386 --> 00:43:00,736
I just talked to Alan on the phone,

717
00:43:00,737 --> 00:43:02,603
he's comin' and he's bring a whole show.

718
00:43:06,689 --> 00:43:09,106

753

Hello, Dori.

754
00:45:05,304 --> 00:45:06,971
Oh, hello, Gloria.

755
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,857
I've just picked up
my new evening dress.

756
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:13,895
Oh.

757
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:16,255
Have you gotten yours yet?

758
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,712
Well, I haven't had time yet but I will.

759
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:22,663
By the way, Gloria, do you need money?

760
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:24,692
I always need money.

761
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,371
Then I'm the one who can lend it to you.

762
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:28,356
I've just gone into the banking business.

763
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:29,626
What?

764
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,040
I'm lending money.

765
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:35,063
$1.00 until next allowance
day to anyone who needs it.

766
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:36,984
What's your rate of interest?

767
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,676
Well, the bank charges as high as 6%,

768
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:41,606
but I'm only charging one.

769
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,628
Just 1%?

770
00:45:43,629 --> 00:45:45,179
If I lend you a dollar,

771
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:48,653
you pay it back to me plus
another dollar interest.

772
00:45:48,654 --> 00:45:50,961
Another dollar interest?

773
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:52,028
It's a bargain when you think

774
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:55,021
the banks are charging as much as 6%.

775
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:58,932
Are you sure you're charging
$1.00 interest on the dollar?

776
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:02,639
1% of a dollar is a dollar, isn't it?

777
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,057
Oh, sure, sure.

778
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:08,878
Tell me, Dori, have you
lent much money yet?

779
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:12,084
You're the first person I've asked.

780
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:14,879
Mm-hmm, where'd you
get the money to lend?

781
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,056
From Arabella.

782
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:17,305
She's my depositor.

783
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,583
How much did she deposit?

784
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:20,417
$15.00.

785
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:24,376
Dori, instead of trying to find a lot

786
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:26,445
of little $1.00 customers,

787
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:31,446
how would you like to lend the
whole 15 to just one person?

788
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:32,955
Who?

789
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,420
Me, with $15.00 more,

790
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:37,489
I could take this tacky ole evening dress

791
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,044
back to the dress shop.

792
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:42,446
I saw a much smarter one there for $45.00.

793
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:44,011
It just came in.

794
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,028
If you lend me the 15 to
buy it, I'll pay ya back

795
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:49,288
plus another 15 for interest.

796
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:51,289
You'll make $15.00 fast.

797
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,018
When will you pay it back?

798
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:58,393
My birthday's next week.

799
00:46:58,394 --> 00:47:00,322
I'm expecting a couple of checks.

800
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:02,726
I'll pay ya back then.

801
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:04,635
Will you give me collateral?

802
00:47:04,636 --> 00:47:07,190
What kind of collateral?

803
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,317
Oh, I don't know.

804
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,354
It has to be something
worth at least $30.00.

805
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:13,365
Tell you what, I'll pledge my new dress.

806
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:15,173
The one I'm going to get.

807
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:17,264
Alright, you write me a note saying,

808
00:47:17,265 --> 00:47:20,872
that if you don't pay me
back, I can have the dress.

809
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:22,474
Then I'll lend you the $15.00.

810
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:23,642
It's a deal.

811
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:30,650
Tommy, can I ask you something?

812
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,234
- Sure.
- Come here.

813
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:39,007
Tommy, what do you think the school

814
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:41,513
would think of a girl who took advantage

815
00:47:41,514 --> 00:47:44,027
of one of her own classmates?

816
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,398
Well, I guess they
wouldn't like here very much.

817
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:49,052
Suppose this girl learned
that one of her classmates

818
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,903
needed money very badly,

819
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:52,681
and she lent it to her?

820
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:54,328
Well that's not taking advantage.

821
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,742
That's pretty nice.

822
00:47:55,743 --> 00:47:57,369
But what if she lent it to her

823
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,352
on condition that she pay it back double?

824
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:02,977
Double?

825
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:05,132
Who'd do a thing like that?

826
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,541
Dori.

827
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,559
Dori?

828
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,205
I don't believe it.

829
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:10,706
You can ask her.

830
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,637
But why?

831
00:48:12,638 --> 00:48:16,353
She was just trying to
make some money for herself.

832
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:18,171
Who told you all this?

833
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:21,619
I'm the one she lent the money to.

834
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,482
That's terrible.

835
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,721
Would be even more terrible

836
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:28,223
if the whole school found out about it.

837
00:48:28,224 --> 00:48:33,224
Of course, I might be persuaded
not to tell anyone about it.

838
00:48:34,004 --> 00:48:34,948
What do you mean?

839
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:38,890
Well, if you took me to
the prom instead of Dori,

840
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:42,641
I might just possibly
forget the whole thing.

841
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:45,100
But I already asked Dori.

842
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:48,840
You can always say you
forget you'd asked me first.

843
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:50,334
I can't do that.

844
00:48:50,335 --> 00:48:51,702
Would you rather the whole school

845
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:54,545
knew about what Dori tried to do to me?

846
00:48:54,546 --> 00:48:57,546
Nobody would talk to her for months.

847
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:10,334
Dori, wait a minute.

848
00:49:10,335 --> 00:49:11,796
Dori, I got wonderful news.

849
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:13,448
- What is it?
- It's Melville.

850
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:15,213
He's taking me to the prom.

851
00:49:15,214 --> 00:49:18,033
He asked me just five minutes ago.

852
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:20,386
Oh, that's wonderful.

853
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,050
This is my big chance.

854
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:24,856
That's why I need the $15.00 I gave you.

855
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:26,270
Oh, no.

856
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,544
I've got to get a permed, a manicure,

857
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:31,508
and maybe even a facial,
so give me back the money.

858
00:49:31,509 --> 00:49:33,501
I've already loaned it out.

859
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:35,059
Then get it back.

860
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,125
A depositor has the right
to get her money back

861
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:38,910
when she wants it, doesn't she?

862
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:39,744
Well, yes, but--

863
00:49:39,745 --> 00:49:42,062
Well this is an emergency.

864
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,751
Arabella, I just can't.

865
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:48,208
Dori Graham, if you
don't give me back my money

866
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:53,004
by tomorrow, I'll, I'll
never speak to you again.

867
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:53,922
Arabella?

868
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:08,082
Gloria, come here.

869
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,517
Gloria, I wanna talk to you.

870
00:50:11,518 --> 00:50:13,093
Well?

871
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,712
It's about that money you borrowed.

872
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,226
Your birthday was last week,

873
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:19,647
and you still haven't paid it back to me.

874
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,281
Oh, that, you really didn't think

875
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:23,613
I was going to pay it back, did you?

876
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:26,459
Besides, my birthday isn't
until five months from now.

877
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,738
But you told me that--

878
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:30,417
And you told me you
wanted $1.00 interest

879
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:32,332
on every dollar you lent me.

880
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:37,333
For your information, that's
not 1% interest, that's 100%.

881
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,799
It is?

882
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,437
If you knew any arithmetic,

883
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:44,514
you'd know that 1% of a
dollar is .01 not $1.00.

884
00:50:44,515 --> 00:50:47,679
Why I could send you
to jail for extortion.

885
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,215
Well, what about the $15.00?

886
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,269
You'll return that to me, won't you?

887
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:53,903
In my own good time.

888
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,720
Maybe a dollar a week.

889
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:57,440
But I need the money now.

890
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:59,524
Oh, isn't that too bad.

891
00:51:00,422 --> 00:51:03,147
Well, I've gotta study for my next class,

892
00:51:03,148 --> 00:51:07,707
and, uh, you'd better brush
up on your arithmetic.

893
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:28,404
Dori?

894
00:51:29,746 --> 00:51:30,579
Oh.

895
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:33,480
Hello, Tommy.

896
00:51:34,618 --> 00:51:36,915
What's the matter?

897
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,083
Oh, nothing.

898
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:42,566
Have you been talking to Gloria?

899
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,984
Did she tell you?

900
00:51:44,821 --> 00:51:46,071
Tell me what?

901
00:51:47,658 --> 00:51:50,908
That's she going to the prom with me.

902
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:52,808
What?

903
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,026
I asked her weeks ago,

904
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:58,444
and I'd thought she'd forgotten about it.

905
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,017
Gloria

906
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:06,737
and you?

907
00:52:12,152 --> 00:52:15,152
Oh, Tommy.

908
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:29,108
Poor little bird.

909
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:31,192

Well, what's the matter now?

00:55:09,798 --> 00:55:10,965
Oh, nothing.

947
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:18,811
Father, if a person lends
another person money,

948
00:55:18,812 --> 00:55:21,411
and the other person refuses to pay,

949
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:24,725
can that person do anything
to the other person?

950
00:55:24,726 --> 00:55:26,274
Well, that depends.

951
00:55:26,275 --> 00:55:28,371
Did the other person give the person

952
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,729
any collateral for the loan?

953
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,317
Yeah, she did.

954
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:34,632
Well, then the person can foreclose.

955
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:35,466
Foreclose?

956
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:38,512
Uh-huh, assume ownership
of the collateral

957
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:40,763
in lieu of the unpaid loan.

958
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:44,521
Assume ownership, really?

959
00:55:45,564 --> 00:55:46,814
It's the law.

960
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:51,304
Hey, where are you going,
it's almost dinner time?

961
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:55,138
Tell Mother not to
wait, I'll be back later.

962
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:06,151
But it's very simple, Miss Silky.

963
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:09,150
I just wanna foreclose
on a collateral dress.

964
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,379
But I don't understand?

965
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,022
Is this some kind of joke?

966
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:14,769
It's absolutely serious.

967
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:18,020
Would you mind waiting just a minute?

968
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:33,913
Miss Silky, is my dress almost ready?

969
00:56:33,914 --> 00:56:36,331
Just a minute.

970
00:56:38,445 --> 00:56:39,362
Here it is.

971
00:56:41,025 --> 00:56:41,858
Oh.

972
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:46,846
It's so beautiful.

973
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,329
I can't wait to see what
it looks like on me.

974
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,163
Dori?

975
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,510
Thank you for calling me, Miss Silky.

976
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:56,553
Father, what are you doing here?

977
00:56:56,554 --> 00:56:58,673
This is a ladies shop.

978
00:56:58,674 --> 00:56:59,689
Miss Silky called me,

979
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,719
and told me she'd keep you here

980
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,150
until I could get here.

981
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:04,318
Now what's this all about?

982
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:09,480
Yeah, that's what I wanna know.

983
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:11,522
I tried to tell you on
the phone, Mr. Barker.

984
00:57:11,523 --> 00:57:13,262
Dori says your daughter
borrowed some money from her

985
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,140
and refused to pay it back,

986
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,622
and now she's claiming this dress.

987
00:57:17,623 --> 00:57:20,173
I'm just foreclosing on the collateral.

988
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:21,859
You mean, Gloria gave you this dress

989
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,613
as collateral for a loan?

990
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:25,856
Why did you have to borrow money?

991
00:57:25,857 --> 00:57:29,637
Well, I didn't really like
the $30.00 dress you bought me,

992
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:34,006
and I happened to see this
beautiful dress for $45.00,

993
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:36,657
and I knew you wouldn't
give me anymore money, so--

994
00:57:36,658 --> 00:57:39,184
So you borrowed it from my daughter,

995
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:41,234
but where did Dori get it to lend?

996
00:57:41,235 --> 00:57:43,036
She borrowed it form Arabella.

997
00:57:43,037 --> 00:57:44,442
No, I didn't.

998
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,572
Arabella was my depositor.

999
00:57:46,573 --> 00:57:48,646
But I don't have to pay the money back

1000
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:51,653
because Dori charged me 100% interest

1001
00:57:51,654 --> 00:57:53,255
when she gave me the money,

1002
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:55,410
and that's against the law.

1003
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,161
100% interest?

1004
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,124
Dori.

1005
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,169
I made a mistake, Father.

1006
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,318
I thought I was charging 1%.

1007
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:08,047
Never was very good at arithmetic

1008
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:10,723
but she knew it, and she didn't tell me.

1009
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:11,786
Besides, you said the dress

1010
00:58:11,787 --> 00:58:14,232
belonged to me as collateral.

1011
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:16,650
Well, yes, it does legally.

1012
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:20,209
Now wait just a minute.

1013
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:22,958
I paid $30.00 for that dress.

1014
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:25,829
And I paid another $15.00.

1015
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:27,146
I'm not going to let you take

1016
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:29,897
a $45.00 dress for a $15.00 loan.

1017
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,504
Well, there's only
one other thing to do.

1018
00:58:33,505 --> 00:58:36,130
Pay Dori the money that
Gloria borrowed from her,

1019
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:38,714
and forget the whole the thing.

1020
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:43,568
I'm not going to pay Gloria's debt.

1021
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:45,270
Well, I admit, you got me stumped.

1022
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,685
Do you have any other suggestions?

1023
00:58:47,686 --> 00:58:49,341
- No.
- Do you?

1024
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:50,708
No.

1025
00:58:50,709 --> 00:58:52,542
I have a suggestion.

1026
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:56,043
Mr. Barker just wants his $30.00.

1027
00:58:56,044 --> 00:58:56,877
Right.

1028
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,744
Father, here's a chance for
you to make a real bargain.

1029
00:59:01,745 --> 00:59:05,190
All you have to do is give
Mr. Barker his $30.00,

1030
00:59:05,191 --> 00:59:09,822
and you get a $45.00 dollar
dress for only $30.00.

1031
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:11,490
Yeah, sounds good.

1032
00:59:13,695 --> 00:59:15,360
Now, wait a minute, young lady.

1033
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:18,038
Our agreement was that I pay $15.00,

1034
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,569
and you earn the other 15.

1035
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:24,946
Yes, but I'm saving you $15.00
at the price of the dress.

1036
00:59:24,947 --> 00:59:28,759
Now that's the same as if
I earned $15.00, isn't it?

1037
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,824
Now, just do as I say.

1038
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:34,408
First, give Gloria's
father his money back.

1039
00:59:37,547 --> 00:59:39,464
Now, the dress is mine.

1040
00:59:40,895 --> 00:59:45,701
But you still have to
give Arabella her $15.00.

1041
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:48,799
How do you think you'll get around that?

1042
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,358
Oh, that's simple.

1043
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:53,789
Here, Miss Silky, I'd like
to turn this $45.00 dress in

1044
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,267
for the $30.00 dress and a $15.00 refund.

1045
00:59:57,268 --> 00:59:58,716
Now you can get the dress for me.

1046
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:01,062
It's only $15.00 more.

1047
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:03,225
After all the trouble you've caused?

1048
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:05,122
Trying to take advantage of Dori?

1049
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:09,046
Sneaking behind my back to
buy a dress that costs more?

1050
01:00:09,047 --> 01:00:10,537
Nothing doing, Gloria.

1051
01:00:10,538 --> 01:00:12,799
I don't buy any dress for you.

1052
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,182
Not even a $30.00 one?

1053
01:00:15,183 --> 01:00:17,972
Sorry, this is the last one left.

1054
01:00:17,973 --> 01:00:20,056
A blue strapless dress.

1055
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,101
Tommy's favorite color.

1056
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:25,962
She's taking my dress.

1057
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:29,468
Come on, we're going home.

1058
01:00:29,469 --> 01:00:30,302
Oh.

1059
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,277
Now let me see.

1060
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:35,984
Dori saved me $15.00,

1061
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:40,982
so that's the same as earning $15.00.

1062
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:43,241
Then she took the dress,

1063
01:00:43,242 --> 01:00:47,133
she exchanged the $45.00
dress for the $30.00 dress--

1064
01:00:47,134 --> 01:00:48,732
