1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:03,734
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:12,895
(thunder rumbling)

3
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:47,481
(Manuel speaking in foreign language)

4
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:01,902
- Has everyone gone?

5
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:02,735
- Yes.

6
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:05,094
We are the only ones left.

7
00:02:05,094 --> 00:02:08,684
Has Juanita returned from the house?

8
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:09,924
- No.

9
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:11,674
She said she would not come back

10
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,661
until she saw Francisco

11
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:15,027
and brought him back to us.

12
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:18,798
- That cursed house.

13
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:20,484
(Juanita speaks in foreign language)

14
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,364
Ever since those two came here

15
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:25,444
there's been nothing but death and sorrow.

16
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:28,683
- Our Francisco, how is he?

17
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,014
- I don't know, mama.

18
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,714
They would not let me see him.

19
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:32,797
- But why?

20
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:35,433
- They say he has the sickness.

21
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:40,433
- Ah! (speaks in foreign language)

22
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:48,067
- Why, why must we lose our
sons and brothers to them?

23
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:50,937
- Perhaps it is God's will.

24
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:54,344
- God's will.

25
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:55,497
God's will.

26
00:02:57,014 --> 00:03:00,394
Was it God's will that
Augustin Roja's child die

27
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:02,394
and that other boy, Jose Alvarez?

28
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:04,224
No, I say no.

29
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:05,447
It's because of them!

30
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:08,404
- You speak in anger, Juanita.

31
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,224
The children became ill.

32
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:14,304
El Patron and his sister,
both great doctors,

33
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,544
could not save them.

34
00:03:15,544 --> 00:03:18,884
- They became ill only
after they went to work

35
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:20,624
in that awful place.

36
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:22,474
And why were they buried at night?

37
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:24,004
So we could not see them

38
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,080
to give them a Christian burial.

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,212
Why, why?

40
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,714
- You know why.

41
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:31,484
They told us the children die

42
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:34,634
of some strange contagious disease

43
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:36,437
and have to be buried at once.

44
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:41,194
- What should we do now?

45
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,554
- We cannot go without Francisco.

46
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,987
We must wait and pray.

47
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,654
I don't know what else to do.

48
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,030
(thunder booming)

49
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,447
- Another wonderful storm.

50
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,374
I congratulate you, dear brother.

51
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,804
You were correct in
choosing this wild land.

52
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:14,637
- It was not I.

53
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,174
It was Professor von Metzler who said

54
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:18,214
in such this part of America

55
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:21,714
you'll find these
electrical storms you need

56
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,424
for your experiments.

57
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,954
- Modest Rudolph.

58
00:04:24,954 --> 00:04:26,891
You never do take any
credit for what you do.

59
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,144
- I want no credit

60
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,951
for these terrible things
we are doing here, Maria.

61
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,344
All I want is to go back to Vienna.

62
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:34,954
- Vienna.

63
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:37,747
We will not see an electrical
storm there in months.

64
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,204
But here the very gods conspire

65
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:42,857
to get them to us all the time.

66
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:46,677
Well, we go to work.

67
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,375
(thunder booming)

68
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,971
In a moment we shall know
if we have succeeded.

69
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:32,834
(electricity crackling)

70
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:42,388
(soft mysterious music)

71
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:48,217
Quick, prepare the injection of digitalis.

72
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,984
Hurry up with the digitalis.

73
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,484
You took long enough.

74
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,697
One would think you did
not want him to live.

75
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:39,554
He's dead.

76
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,972
(thunder booming)

77
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,547
What a fool I've been.

78
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:01,144
I've allowed the dual sonic impulsator

79
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:03,504
to be attached only to the body.

80
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:06,044
Let's see what
grandfather's notation says.

81
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:10,694
You see, the dual sonic
impulsator must also be attached

82
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:11,614
to a living brain

83
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:14,954
to transmit living vibrations
to the artificial brain.

84
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,944
- But such a powerful electric impulse

85
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:20,404
might prove fatal to the
brain of a living person.

86
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:22,717
- That chance I am willing to take.

87
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:27,424
It's because we've been forced
to use the brains of children

88
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,504
that we've failed.

89
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:29,624
What we need is a man,

90
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:31,577
a powerful man, a giant.

91
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,114
Then we shall succeed.

92
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,997
- But what good will it do to succeed?

93
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,534
- Imagine.

94
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:41,434
We'll have someone to do our bidding,

95
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:42,777
who can't be put to death.

96
00:08:44,114 --> 00:08:46,394
Just as we have given it life,

97
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,974
only we can take its life away.

98
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:53,594
- Maria, we've already caused
the death of three children

99
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,394
and violated the graves of others

100
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,357
just to make the experiment.

101
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:00,434
My, you are a humanitarian.

102
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:02,004
You should have stayed in Europe

103
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:04,957
and given pink pills to sweet old ladies.

104
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:10,664
This is the last artificial brain

105
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:13,064
Grandfather Frankenstein made.

106
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,794
The secret of how to
make this died with him.

107
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:18,346
If I fail in this last attempt,

108
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,584
I too am willing to die.

109
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,884
- Is it so terrible to fail?

110
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:24,134
- You're a fool, Rudolph!

111
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:28,307
We hold the secret of life in our hands.

112
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:30,717
- Maria, Maria,

113
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:34,354
this has already caused
grandfather his life,

114
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,774
and father--
- Father was a weakling.

115
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:39,174
He dared not try the experiments,

116
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,327
only on paper.

117
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,361
- You know, Rudolph,

118
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:46,857
sometimes I think you remind me of father.

119
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:50,264
- What do you want to do next?

120
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:52,844
There's no one else left to experiment on.

121
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,654
This boy was the last,

122
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:56,534
and his sister Juanita was here

123
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:57,734
demanding to see him.

124
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,524
- What did you tell her?

125
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,194
- The same as the others,

126
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:03,174
that the boy has a
highly contagious disease

127
00:10:03,174 --> 00:10:04,344
and cannot be seen.

128
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,668
- Good.

129
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:09,202
These peasants are
ignorant and superstitious.

130
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:11,444
We have nothing to fear from them.

131
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,264
- When the Lopez family finds out

132
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:17,067
that Francisco is dead, they
will leave like the others.

133
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,034
He'll be alone,

134
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,307
all alone in this wilderness,

135
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:24,167
and I can't stand.

136
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,024
- Everything is just right here.

137
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,744
The isolation, the electrical storms

138
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,327
for the energy we need.

139
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,904
I know you want to leave.

140
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,094
Well, you can't.

141
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:39,704
Where would you go, Vienna?

142
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:42,054
The police are looking for us there.

143
00:10:42,054 --> 00:10:43,994
They did not understand
our work any better

144
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:45,527
than these peasants.

145
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:51,704
Rudolph, we are safer here

146
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:54,270
than anywhere else.

147
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,937
(intense music)

148
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:04,477
Now, now that I know what is wrong,

149
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:08,414
somehow I will find the right man

150
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,414
to withstand the shock of my experiment.

151
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,647
He must be big and strong,

152
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:15,997
strong as a giant.

153
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:21,051
(upbeat playful music)

154
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,927
- This is the time, Stacy.

155
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,264
Stacy, get up.

156
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:10,482
(crowd shouting)
- Come on, Stacy.

157
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,815
- Get up, Stacy.

158
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:19,444
- Hank, you better win this.

159
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:20,644
We're stone broke.

160
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:22,694
- What makes you think I'm losing, Jesse?

161
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:43,584
- Well, that's that.

162
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:48,124
- Nobody's beaten Stacy
since I bought this saloon.

163
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:50,174
And that's over 10 years ago.

164
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,714
- There's always a first time.

165
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:52,984
I'll take that bet money now.

166
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:56,834
- Not so fast, not so fast.

167
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:58,434
I could have the sheriff lock you two up

168
00:12:58,434 --> 00:12:59,854
for disturbing the peace,

169
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:01,694
but I'll make you a deal.

170
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,817
Leave town and I won't press charges.

171
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:06,104
- You better pay up, mister.

172
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,233
- Why should I?

173
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,774
- Well, for one thing,

174
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:11,158
I beat your man fair and square, I did.

175
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:15,094
For another thing, we
need the money real bad.

176
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,334
And for another thing,

177
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:18,584
the man you're holding
out on is Jesse James.

178
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,374
- (chuckles) I heard that
Jesse James was killed

179
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,124
up at Northridge.

180
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:25,957
- There are a lot of folks that think

181
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:27,674
that the James boys were wiped out.

182
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:28,974
Well I'm Jesse, all right.

183
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,134
And there's only one way to prove it.

184
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:35,744
I'll take that bet money.

185
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:44,027
No hard feelings.

186
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,544
You see, we weren't all
killed at Northridge.

187
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:49,454
We've sure been on the
run ever since though.

188
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,664
That makes a man hungry.

189
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,134
Why Hank and I haven't had anything to eat

190
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:54,434
since when was the last time we ate, Hank?

191
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,854
- It's been one whole day,

192
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:58,074
but it seems more like a month.

193
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:59,694
- Hank woulda taken your man a lot easier

194
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:00,644
if he'd had his full strength.

195
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:01,594
Now, ain't that right, Hank?

196
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:03,997
- Yep, how about that steak now?

197
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,387
- Now that's an idea.

198
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:09,347
And we'll pay for it with your money.

199
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:18,627
(soft mysterious music)

200
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,724
- And I say you had no right

201
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,634
to call in Jesse James and his boys.

202
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,894
This was our deal.

203
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,546
My deal if you come right down to it.

204
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:39,544
This was that big killings

205
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,464
you've always been telling me about.

206
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,931
You know, the one you've never
been able to come up with?

207
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:45,707
And now you tell me we gotta
split it with Jesse James.

208
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:49,394
- If you weren't my brother,

209
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,697
I'd really work you over.

210
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,764
You think we can pull this deal ourselves,

211
00:14:53,764 --> 00:14:55,477
the two of us and Pete out there?

212
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,834
- Well at least you coulda
talked it over with me first.

213
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,814
- I'm the leader of the Wild Bunch.

214
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,984
I ain't talking nothing over with nobody,

215
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:06,767
and if you don't like it, get out.

216
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:11,894
- Just the same, my share's gonna be 1/3.

217
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:13,984
And you can cut up the rest
between you and Jesse James

218
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:14,817
any way you want to.

219
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:18,004
- Your share is going to be
exactly what I say it is,

220
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,380
no more, no less.

221
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,297
(mysterious music)

222
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,964
(Pete imitating bird call)

223
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,014
That's Pete's signal.

224
00:15:58,206 --> 00:15:59,084
You must be Jesse James.

225
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,057
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,257
- [Butch] Is that Hank Tracy?

227
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:06,814
- And you'd be Butch Curry,
head man of the Wild Bunch.

228
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:08,234
- That's right.

229
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,157
Come on in, Jesse.

230
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,244
This is Jesse James.

231
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:22,022
This is my brother, Lonny.

232
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,764
- Lonny, Pete Ketchum our lookout.

233
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:26,194
- Hey.
- Hi.

234
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,387
- Hank Tracy, Lonny, Pete.

235
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,219
- Hi.
- Well, this is the bunch.

236
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:34,654
We got hit at St. Joe,
Liberty and Little Blue.

237
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:36,651
We lost 11 men in all.

238
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,254
- I can't hardly believe
the famous Wild Bunch

239
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:39,614
is down to three men.

240
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:42,984
- I don't think the James
boys are doing much better.

241
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,657
Frank James hiding out in
Kentucky as a preacher.

242
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:49,697
I hear the real Jesse
James was shot to death.

243
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,784
- Everybody is trying to make me a corpse.

244
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:54,264
Well, I don't like it.

245
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,714
You trying to make me a liar?

246
00:16:56,775 --> 00:17:01,205
- (laughs) No harm, no harm at all.

247
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:04,294
It's just that there's a lot
of four-flushers around here

248
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:06,053
that's claiming to be Jesse James.

249
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:08,386
(guns fire)

250
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,824
- Now, we didn't come
here for any trouble.

251
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,824
We came here to do a
little job with you boys.

252
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:17,984
I'm sorry, Lonny,

253
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:20,134
but you just backed
yourself into a corner.

254
00:17:21,224 --> 00:17:22,564
- Take it easy, Jesse.

255
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:24,414
He'll be all right when he sobers up.

256
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,044
Now, to tell you the truth, Jesse,

257
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,014
I figured you'd have more men.

258
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,934
I didn't know that you were
down to Hank and yourself.

259
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,714
But I still think we
got enough to pull this.

260
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,114
And I think you'll agree
that it's worth it,

261
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,464
when I tell you what it is.

262
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:39,567
Have a seat.

263
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:48,236
On the way here, you passed
through the Paseo del Norte,

264
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:49,504
do you know it?

265
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:52,744
- Yeah, narrow cut about
30 miles out of Bisbee.

266
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,577
- We're gonna take
delivery of $100,000 there.

267
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:57,747
- $100,000?

268
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:00,774
- I thought you'd like the idea.

269
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,914
- That's an awful lot of money, you sure?

270
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,715
- Lonny is sparking a girl
that works at the bank,

271
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:08,471
and when the bank gets fat
to the tune of $100,000,

272
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:11,424
they transfer it to Fort Buchanan.

273
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,324
And later on they set back
east for the Army supply train.

274
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,428
Right, Lonny?

275
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,678
- That's right.

276
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:22,014
My word has always been good
enough for the Wild Bunch,

277
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:23,507
Mr. James.

278
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:25,607
- No harm, no harm.

279
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:29,414
That's an awful lot of
money at one at one time.

280
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,484
- Jesse may have looked
down many a gun barrel

281
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:34,044
for a lot less than that, eh Jesse?

282
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:34,977
- Right, Hank.

283
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:37,954
Seems to me anybody
shipping that much money

284
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,864
through a narrow pass would
figure that's a natural place

285
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:40,859
for a hold-up?

286
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,032
- That's the way the bank figures it too,

287
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:44,914
and that's why they send a stagecoach

288
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:49,153
on through the pass with
passengers and no money as a decoy.

289
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:49,986
- Decoy?

290
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:54,034
- That's right, when the
first stagecoach gets through,

291
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,454
they signal a second stagecoach,

292
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:57,494
that's always clear.

293
00:18:57,494 --> 00:18:59,534
That's the one we'll be waiting for

294
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,634
with the money and no passengers.

295
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:02,984
Simple and sweet, ain't it?

296
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,431
What's the matter, don't you like it?

297
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:07,644
- Eh, it's too simple.

298
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:09,084
What's the hitch?

299
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,904
- No hitch, the second
coach has only a driver

300
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:12,737
and a shotgun.

301
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:15,364
And we'll hit 'em so fast,
they won't know what happened.

302
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:19,810
I'd still like it better
if we had more men,

303
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,134
but I think we got enough to do it.

304
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:23,274
Are you game?

305
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:24,107
Wanna try it?

306
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:26,804
- You know me, Jesse.

307
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:28,017
Whatever you say.

308
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:30,504
- What's the split?

309
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:35,804
- Well, there's five of us.

310
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:37,104
We'll split it--
- Butch.

311
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,644
- We'll split it five ways.

312
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:44,457
- Well, I didn't ride
300 miles for my health.

313
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:52,506
It's a deal.

314
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:57,754
- Marshall, I tell you, I
know that's Jesse James.

315
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,494
I made sure of that.

316
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:02,418
So you get Jesse, and I
get the $10,000 reward,

317
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,634
dead or alive.

318
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:05,874
- How do I know you're not sending us

319
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,047
right into a trap?

320
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:10,954
- Well, I'm riding right
there with him, ain't I?

321
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:12,137
If I was lying to you, it'd be easy enough

322
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:13,707
for you to pick me off.

323
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,344
Besides, I'm going straight.

324
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:18,647
- Oh, I can't afford not
to go along with you,

325
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:21,024
but let me tell you one thing.

326
00:20:21,024 --> 00:20:22,474
If you wanna collect that reward,

327
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:25,067
you better make sure you
stay out of the line of fire.

328
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:26,964
Marshal, I tell you, I'm going straight.

329
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,854
Now, all you gotta do is tell your men,

330
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:29,957
and I'm on your side.

331
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:34,374
Well, I guess I better be
getting back to the boys.

332
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:37,024
They might start to miss me.

333
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:40,167
We wouldn't want that to happen,
would we marshal? (laughs)

334
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:45,964
Well, we got a deal.

335
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:52,494
(soft mysterious music)

336
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,483
- Now, you men know what to do.

337
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:14,174
But I don't want anybody
getting trigger happy,

338
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,427
because one of 'em
happens to be Jesse James.

339
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:19,464
Now, let's spread out and get up high.

340
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,244
You two men take this side.

341
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:24,154
Andy, we'll take this side and the horses.

342
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:24,987
Let's go.

343
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:56,821
- All right, let's go.

344
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,424
All right Jesse, this is it.

345
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,654
Now remember, after the
first coach gets through,

346
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:07,064
they fire two shots.

347
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,071
That's the signal for the
second coach to come on.

348
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:09,904
You got it?

349
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,034
You and Hank take that side.

350
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:13,529
We'll take this side.

351
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:14,362
- What's the matter, Lonny?

352
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:15,195
You seem nervous.

353
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:16,651
Something bothering you?

354
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,854
- And just what are you driving at?

355
00:22:19,854 --> 00:22:21,524
- All right, you two,
knock it off, knock it off.

356
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,514
We're all a little edgy.

357
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:24,347
Come on.

358
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,072
Lonny!

359
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,847
Get ready boys, first coach is coming.

360
00:22:58,494 --> 00:22:59,644
- That's the first one.

361
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:15,894
(gun fires)

362
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,971
That's the signal.

363
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:19,821
- Here she comes now, Jesse.

364
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,730
- Get ready, here she comes.

365
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,766
(intense music)

366
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:34,099
(guns fire)

367
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,714
- How about it, Jesse?

368
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:49,224
You haven't got a chance.

369
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:51,224
- Let's get out of here.

370
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,419
- Jesse, look out!

371
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,612
(gun fires)

372
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,945
(guns fire)

373
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:23,474
- Well, that's the end of the Wild Bunch.

374
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:25,394
- Ain't he one of them?

375
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:28,024
- Lonny, he tells me he's going straight.

376
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,841
- So I am, you saw me.

377
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,017
Didn't I try to help you get Jesse James?

378
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,624
- Yeah.

379
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:36,114
Now I guess you did it that.

380
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:37,557
I wanna thank you men.

381
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:40,194
Now, you better get back to
your jobs and your homes.

382
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:41,044
- What about you?

383
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:45,084
- My job is going after those two.

384
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:47,634
And I can't say I like
it very much either.

385
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,084
- I'm going with you marshal.

386
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:53,004
- You want that reward
pretty bad, don't you Lonny?

387
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:54,647
- Yeah, I want that 10,000,

388
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,864
but I wanna see Jesse James'
eyes looking right at me

389
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:58,727
when I shoot him.

390
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:02,076
- I never figured you'd
try to shoot Jesse James

391
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:04,446
from the front, Lonny.

392
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:05,998
All right, let's get these
two men in the stagecoach,

393
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:07,179
get 'em back in town.

394
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:09,346
- You guys give me a hand.

395
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,034
(ominous music)

396
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,416
- Just hold it here.

397
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:22,074
- I'll be all right, won't I, Jesse?

398
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:22,907
- Sure you will.

399
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:29,217
Let's rest here awhile and we'll move on.

400
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,738
(Manuel speaking in foreign language)

401
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:19,817
- We have nothing, nothing.

402
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,404
- I don't mean you no harm.

403
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:25,760
- Oh. (speaks in foreign language)

404
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,886
(Jesse speaks in foreign language)

405
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,977
(Manuel speaks in foreign language)

406
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:32,994
- He speaks a little bit.

407
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:35,334
- Well, my friend's sick.

408
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:38,184
I wonder if you'd mind if
we'd rest with you a spell.

409
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:45,778
(Manuel speaks in foreign language)

410
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:46,611
- Gracias.

411
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,308
(Manuel speaks in foreign language)

412
00:27:51,308 --> 00:27:52,399
(Nina speaks in foreign language)

413
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,549
(Juanita speaks in foreign language)

414
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:55,495
(Manuel speaks in foreign language)

415
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:59,662
(Nina speaks in foreign language)

416
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:11,821
- He's been shot!

417
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,717
- Well, he was cleaning his gun.

418
00:28:21,914 --> 00:28:24,157
- Here, let me help you.

419
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:39,994
Dip this into the hot
water right over there.

420
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:04,957
The bullet must come out.

421
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:07,534
- I know it.

422
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:09,084
- There's a doctor in Prescott.

423
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:13,704
- Well, we can't go into Prescott.

424
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:15,764
We can't go into any town.

425
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:16,597
- I understand.

426
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:20,004
I knew what you were when
you first came into camp.

427
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:25,714
Your friend is dying.

428
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:28,117
- Dying?

429
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:32,107
- The wound is very bad, very bad.

430
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,254
I will take him to the doctor.

431
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:39,824
- Where?

432
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:41,464
- Do not worry.

433
00:29:41,464 --> 00:29:42,297
He will be safe.

434
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:44,917
- Thanks, thanks very much.

435
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:52,344
- The man is dying.

436
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:54,694
I'm taking him back to the
doctors at the mission.

437
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:55,804
- No, my child.

438
00:29:55,804 --> 00:29:57,584
You must not go back to them!

439
00:29:57,584 --> 00:29:59,444
- But I have to.

440
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,413
I can't let him die.

441
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:02,246
- [Manuel] And if you go there,

442
00:30:02,246 --> 00:30:04,254
something terrible will happen to you.

443
00:30:04,254 --> 00:30:05,424
- I'm not afraid.

444
00:30:05,424 --> 00:30:07,354
- I say you are not to go back.

445
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:08,334
I forbid it.

446
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,204
- But papa!

447
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,077
- I forbid it!

448
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:22,331
- We must wait awhile.

449
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:28,964
(mysterious music)

450
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,144
We can go now.

451
00:30:58,615 --> 00:30:59,448
- Hank.

452
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,327
Can you walk?

453
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:05,494
- [Hank] Yeah.

454
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:31,387
- Hey you.

455
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:35,870
- Senor.

456
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,760
- Senor, do you speak English?

457
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,854
- A little.

458
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:42,104
- We've been following two men.

459
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:44,667
One's a big man, and he's been wounded.

460
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:47,874
Do you understand?

461
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:48,737
Comprehenda?

462
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:52,744
- Si, senor.

463
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,814
- Well, did you see them?

464
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:55,864
- [Manuel] No, senor.

465
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:01,647
- Marshal.

466
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:08,074
So you didn't see anybody, huh?

467
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:08,907
Marshal.

468
00:32:11,444 --> 00:32:12,587
Take a look at these.

469
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:16,864
- Hmm, coulda been them.

470
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:19,037
I got a hunch they were here.

471
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,942
Well folks say Jesse
James steals from the rich

472
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,264
and gives to the poor.

473
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,664
Adios, senor.

474
00:32:25,664 --> 00:32:27,747
- You're lying, you're lying to us.

475
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:29,024
They were here and you
helped 'em get away.

476
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:30,594
I oughta kill you.

477
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:31,671
- Let him alone.

478
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,484
- Juanita, she went away
with them in the night.

479
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:50,884
We must go after her.

480
00:32:50,884 --> 00:32:52,944
- No, when Francisco died,

481
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,394
I swore that I would go
away and never come back.

482
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:57,804
And I will not, not even for Juanita.

483
00:32:57,804 --> 00:32:59,764
- Then I will go back without you.

484
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:01,754
- You would be lost in five minutes.

485
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,164
You will do as I say!

486
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:04,564
As Juanita should have done!

487
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:08,953
(soft music)

488
00:33:16,404 --> 00:33:17,654
- How do you feel, senor?

489
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,884
I'll cook you some broth,

490
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:23,897
if Jesse's luck can bring
us something to eat.

491
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:26,064
I'll bring you some water.

492
00:33:57,381 --> 00:34:00,214
(Juanita screams)

493
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,261
- Where's Juanita?

494
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:17,784
I told her to stay here.

495
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,001
Juanita?

496
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:46,976
Juanita?

497
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,585
- [Juanita] Look out Jesse!

498
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:02,756
(gun fires)

499
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:20,745
(men grunting)

500
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,266
- Ah!

501
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:40,779
- Jesse.

502
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:52,084
(intense music)

503
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:21,187
Oh, you saved my life, Jesse.

504
00:36:26,294 --> 00:36:28,711
(soft music)

505
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:40,416
Look there.

506
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,084
That is the place I told you about.

507
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:50,377
There's where the doctors are.

508
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,364
This is our home.

509
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:54,197
I wait here.

510
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,944
- You know how to use one of these though?

511
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:03,777
- Yes.

512
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:07,804
- Don't be frightened, Juanita.

513
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:11,164
- I'm not, now that you're here.

514
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:12,461
I'll be waiting for you.

515
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:59,417
- Who is it?

516
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:00,717
- We wanna see the doctor.

517
00:38:03,724 --> 00:38:04,557
We wanna see the doctor.

518
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,504
My friend is badly hurt.

519
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:08,514
- Who sent you to us?

520
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:10,114
- A girl by the name of Juanita.

521
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:13,944
- Juanita, is she back here?

522
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:15,854
- Yes, come on, you're wasting time.

523
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:16,687
- Just a minute.

524
00:38:26,011 --> 00:38:26,844
Maria, Maria.

525
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:30,924
- What is it, Rudolph?

526
00:38:30,924 --> 00:38:32,974
- Two men, they are looking for a doctor.

527
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,544
Perhaps it's the police.

528
00:38:35,544 --> 00:38:36,884
- Police here?

529
00:38:36,884 --> 00:38:38,517
Hundreds of miles from nowhere?

530
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:40,507
You are a fool.

531
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,854
- The girl Juanita is back.

532
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,184
She brought them here.

533
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,654
- And you're afraid of an ignorant girl?

534
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,171
I shall take care of it.

535
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:04,297
Come in.

536
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:08,517
What happened?

537
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:10,814
- You're the doctor?

538
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:13,897
- Yes, my brother and I are both doctors.

539
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:15,677
What happened?

540
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,397
- Well, he shot himself cleaning his gun.

541
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:29,254
- We will be glad to help your friend.

542
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:30,424
Won't we, Rudolph?

543
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:33,964
- Maria, I believe that--
- Rudolph, the laboratory.

544
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:38,487
This way.

545
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,667
Take him in there, put him on the table.

546
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:53,894
- The man's story is
obviously a false one.

547
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:55,834
- So much the better.

548
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,224
They must be running from the law.

549
00:39:57,224 --> 00:39:58,824
Why else would they seek us out?

550
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,775
Heaven sent them to us.

551
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:03,608
- Heaven?

552
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:16,097
- Please wait in the hall
while we examine the patient.

553
00:40:17,064 --> 00:40:19,504
- All right, I'd like to take
care of the horses anyway.

554
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,194
- If you put them in the lower stable,

555
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:22,767
they will be well hidden there.

556
00:40:24,694 --> 00:40:26,057
- I'll be right back.

557
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:31,685
(ominous music)

558
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:48,947
- Jesse, Jesse!

559
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:55,114
- Whom are you calling?

560
00:40:55,114 --> 00:40:57,767
- Jesse James.

561
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,527
Don't let him leave me.

562
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:06,401
- Jesse James.

563
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:13,074
Rudolph, it's even better than I thought.

564
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,194
The one outside is Jesse James.

565
00:41:15,194 --> 00:41:18,189
The whole countryside must
be looking for these two.

566
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,356
Perfect, Rudolph, perfect.

567
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,844
I have plans for them both.

568
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:30,724
- His wound is bad, festering.

569
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:31,834
- It is nothing.

570
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,454
He's strong as a giant.

571
00:41:33,454 --> 00:41:35,281
What a brute he will make.

572
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,144
- Howdy, ma'am.

573
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:11,367
I'm Marshal MacPhee.

574
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,594
We've been trialing two men.

575
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:14,444
Did they stop here?

576
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,684
- Oh, two men?

577
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:18,310
- [Marshal] Yes, one of them was wounded.

578
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,267
- Oh, no, no.

579
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:20,617
They're not here.

580
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:22,567
- Well if you don't mind,

581
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:24,137
I'll come in and look around.

582
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:38,533
- I told you they weren't here.

583
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,283
- I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

584
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,147
- Your friend is very sick, Mr.---

585
00:42:58,248 --> 00:42:59,081
- Howard.

586
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,713
- Ah yes, Mr. Howard.

587
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:04,134
He has a very high temperature,

588
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:06,554
but my brother is an excellent doctor.

589
00:43:06,554 --> 00:43:07,387
- Mm-hmm.

590
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:09,944
- Won't you come to the library?

591
00:43:09,944 --> 00:43:11,061
I want to talk to you.

592
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:25,574
Please sit down, Mr. Howard.

593
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:35,537
Did Juanita tell you some
terrible tales about us?

594
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:38,279
- Why do you say that?

595
00:43:38,279 --> 00:43:41,184
- Well, what did she tell you?

596
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:42,404
- Nothing.

597
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:44,004
We ran into the Lopez family,

598
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:46,154
and Juanita offered to
bring us to a doctor.

599
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:46,987
- Nothing else?

600
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:49,924
- Should she have told us something else?

601
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,887
- No, I suppose not.

602
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:57,004
Perhaps you're wondering why we live

603
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:58,527
in this old abandoned mission.

604
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:01,464
The answer is quite simple.

605
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:04,004
My brother and I came here from Europe.

606
00:44:04,004 --> 00:44:05,594
We are scientists.

607
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:07,174
Perhaps ahead of our time.

608
00:44:07,174 --> 00:44:09,730
Our experiments were not always understood

609
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,854
or appreciated in our own country.

610
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:13,534
So we had to leave.

611
00:44:13,534 --> 00:44:14,754
Finally, we came here.

612
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:19,144
When I realized that out here
my brother and I could stop

613
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:22,084
from running, I took
possession of this old mission

614
00:44:22,084 --> 00:44:23,974
and fixed it up for our work.

615
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:27,024
- Well, I must say it's different.

616
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:29,074
I mean, making a home out of a monastery,

617
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:31,654
sort of lonesome I should think.

618
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:35,087
- It has its compensations.

619
00:44:37,354 --> 00:44:38,357
Won't you join me?

620
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:43,397
Help yourself.

621
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:46,564
- Well, thanks.

622
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:49,802
It's been a long time
since we stopped to eat.

623
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:51,431
(knocking)

624
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:54,098
(ominous music)

625
00:45:11,494 --> 00:45:12,327
Yes, gentleman.

626
00:45:13,174 --> 00:45:14,114
- Howdy, ma'am.

627
00:45:14,114 --> 00:45:15,584
I'm Marshal MacPhee.

628
00:45:15,584 --> 00:45:17,404
We're trailing two outlaws.

629
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:18,784
- Outlaws?

630
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:20,244
- Oh, don't be frightened.

631
00:45:20,244 --> 00:45:22,034
They're not the type to hurt women.

632
00:45:22,034 --> 00:45:24,034
Besides, one of 'em is badly hurt.

633
00:45:24,034 --> 00:45:26,744
- And who are these outlaws?

634
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:29,024
- One's Jesse James,
the other is Hank Tracy.

635
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:31,954
- Well my brother and I have neither seen

636
00:45:31,954 --> 00:45:33,604
or heard anyone today.

637
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:36,494
But if we do, we shall send word to you.

638
00:45:36,494 --> 00:45:37,327
- Thank you.

639
00:45:37,327 --> 00:45:38,160
- Where will you be?

640
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,704
- I have a feeling they're holding up

641
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:40,824
in this area someplace.

642
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,119
So I think we'll spend
a few days in Shelby.

643
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,321
- Very well.

644
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:45,321
- Thank you.

645
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:03,704
- Just the marshal
looking for some outlaws.

646
00:46:03,704 --> 00:46:07,504
- Oh, did he say who they were?

647
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:09,007
- No, Mr. Howard.

648
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:14,554
While my brother is taking
care of your friend,

649
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:17,454
I hope you will decide
to stay here with us.

650
00:46:17,454 --> 00:46:19,374
- Well, thanks.

651
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:20,617
Well, I'd like that.

652
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:23,204
- Now if you'll excuse me.

653
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:25,134
I will see if I can help my brother.

654
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:37,607
How is he?

655
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:40,037
- Lost a lot of blood.

656
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,484
- He looks all right to me.

657
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:46,031
I intend to use him in my next experiment.

658
00:46:46,031 --> 00:46:49,378
- Maria, please stop
this terrible experiment.

659
00:46:49,378 --> 00:46:52,584
We'll have another
death on our conscience.

660
00:46:52,584 --> 00:46:54,144
- Don't be an imbecile.

661
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,094
If I turned him over to the marshal,

662
00:46:56,094 --> 00:46:57,134
he'd be hanged anyway.

663
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:58,617
So what has he got to lose?

664
00:47:00,644 --> 00:47:02,777
Now go get that girl Juanita to help you.

665
00:47:03,694 --> 00:47:07,604
Remember, he must stay alive.

666
00:47:07,604 --> 00:47:10,814
- I think it's a mistake to
bring her into this house.

667
00:47:10,814 --> 00:47:12,634
- Let it be my mistake then.

668
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:15,714
But get her here where I
can keep an eye on her.

669
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:25,969
Wonderful.

670
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:28,872
Wonderful.

671
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,720
(dramatic music)

672
00:47:55,774 --> 00:47:57,964
- Well, good morning.

673
00:47:57,964 --> 00:47:58,880
- [Hank] Morning.

674
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,951
- How do you feel this morning?

675
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:00,997
- Pretty good.

676
00:48:01,944 --> 00:48:03,897
You've been awful good to me, Juanita.

677
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:06,767
Hardly anybody's been that good,

678
00:48:07,924 --> 00:48:09,364
except maybe Jesse.

679
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:11,037
I can't thank you enough.

680
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:14,664
- I don't do this because I want thanks.

681
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:19,357
- Juanita, when I get well
and Jesse and I leave,

682
00:48:20,594 --> 00:48:22,334
will you go with us?

683
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:25,107
- No, I must stay here.

684
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:29,965
Someday when the Frankensteins leave,

685
00:48:29,965 --> 00:48:32,257
my people will come back.

686
00:48:33,194 --> 00:48:35,916
- You must be wrong about them, Juanita.

687
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,967
Look how good they're treating me.

688
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:42,387
- Perhaps, but out there in the graveyard,

689
00:48:43,594 --> 00:48:45,237
I see my brother's grave.

690
00:48:46,984 --> 00:48:47,817
No.

691
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,367
My place is here.

692
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,656
- Then I'll stay here with you.

693
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:55,004
- Oh no, you mustn't.

694
00:48:55,004 --> 00:48:55,837
I won't let you.

695
00:48:57,214 --> 00:48:59,104
As soon as you get well,

696
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:00,928
you must go.

697
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:01,974
- But Juanita.

698
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:04,327
- No, no.

699
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:07,684
- [Hank] Juanita.

700
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,833
(soft guitar music)

701
00:49:26,024 --> 00:49:26,857
- You know what?

702
00:49:28,714 --> 00:49:32,117
Today, Hank asked me to
come with you when you go.

703
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:39,557
Don't you want me to go with you?

704
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,024
- It isn't that, Juanita.

705
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:42,857
It's just.

706
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:47,127
- Well, I'm waiting.

707
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:51,324
- When I first met you, I
told you I'm Jesse James.

708
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:52,614
I'm an outlaw.

709
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,307
- You are the outlaw, that I know.

710
00:49:56,364 --> 00:49:57,717
But you haven't told me,

711
00:49:58,694 --> 00:50:00,317
do you want me to go with you.

712
00:50:08,694 --> 00:50:09,794
- There's your answer.

713
00:50:11,584 --> 00:50:15,354
- That is all I wanted to know.

714
00:50:15,354 --> 00:50:19,594
No, I can't not leave this place.

715
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:20,647
I must not.

716
00:50:22,484 --> 00:50:23,504
But I had to know

717
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:26,157
that you wanted me.

718
00:50:28,877 --> 00:50:30,937
- If that isn't just like a woman!

719
00:50:35,154 --> 00:50:38,384
- Please, do not be angry with me.

720
00:50:38,384 --> 00:50:43,384
You see, I must stay just as you must go.

721
00:50:44,314 --> 00:50:45,984
- Why must I go?

722
00:50:45,984 --> 00:50:49,373
- Because I do not
trust the Frankensteins.

723
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:51,043
They're wicked.

724
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:52,766
They're terrible people.

725
00:50:52,766 --> 00:50:53,866
They will destroy you.

726
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:56,504
They destroyed our village

727
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:58,417
and some of our boys.

728
00:51:00,205 --> 00:51:02,217
And they will destroy you and Hank.

729
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:08,037
Promise on my brother's grave,

730
00:51:08,938 --> 00:51:09,771
please go.

731
00:51:21,684 --> 00:51:26,684
Someday when things are
different for you and me,

732
00:51:26,844 --> 00:51:27,827
you come back.

733
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,127
I'll wait.

734
00:51:55,624 --> 00:51:57,494
- It's kinda hot inside.

735
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,444
I thought I'd come out for a smoke.

736
00:51:59,444 --> 00:52:01,957
- Yes, it's nice out here.

737
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:07,174
- It's kinda nice country.

738
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:09,649
Why's everybody except Juanita gone away?

739
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:10,704
- We are scientists.

740
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:12,794
We make experiments.

741
00:52:12,794 --> 00:52:15,204
These people are ignorant.

742
00:52:15,204 --> 00:52:18,624
They do not understand
and they're frightened.

743
00:52:18,624 --> 00:52:19,697
So they run away.

744
00:52:21,874 --> 00:52:24,344
- Seems like some of 'em
didn't quite make it.

745
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:28,144
- Ah yes, Francisco, a sweet child.

746
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,874
He became ill, but my brother
and I could not save him.

747
00:52:31,874 --> 00:52:35,387
He was weak, not like your friend Hank.

748
00:52:37,224 --> 00:52:38,984
Hank is improving.

749
00:52:38,984 --> 00:52:40,634
- Thanks to you and your brother.

750
00:52:41,634 --> 00:52:42,467
And Juanita.

751
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:47,094
- He's doing even better
than I'd hoped for.

752
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:49,894
- How soon do you think
we'll be able to leave?

753
00:52:49,894 --> 00:52:51,694
- I want to speak to you about that.

754
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:02,017
I want you to stay.

755
00:53:03,085 --> 00:53:04,644
- I'm sorry.

756
00:53:04,644 --> 00:53:05,477
I made a promise

757
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:08,128
that we'd leave as soon as
Hank was well enough to travel.

758
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:12,159
- A promise to whom?

759
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,409
- To myself, you might say.

760
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:21,543
- It's lonesome out here
and very difficult for us.

761
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:26,046
We do not know how to cope
with this wild country.

762
00:53:26,046 --> 00:53:26,879
Stay here.

763
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,932
We need you.

764
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:30,849
I need you.

765
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,620
I'm on the verge of a great experiment,

766
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,224
and I know I will succeed this time.

767
00:53:38,224 --> 00:53:40,557
I will build an empire here.

768
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:45,370
I want you to share in everything.

769
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,370
My experiments, my life.

770
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,877
- How can I help you?

771
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:53,377
- Rudolph is weak.

772
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:55,924
I need you.

773
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:00,094
I need your strength.

774
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,323
- We'll leave as soon is Hank
is well enough to travel.

775
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:17,574
- I'm sorry I made a fool of myself.

776
00:54:17,574 --> 00:54:19,567
Goodnight, Mr. Howard.

777
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:42,864
You're to find Mr. Howard

778
00:54:42,864 --> 00:54:44,247
and give him this envelope.

779
00:54:46,054 --> 00:54:46,887
- What is it?

780
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:50,134
- You are to tell him it's
a prescription for Hank,

781
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:52,284
that he's taken a turn for the worst.

782
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:55,394
And that we need this
prescription to be filled.

783
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:57,484
- But Hank is doing well,

784
00:54:57,484 --> 00:55:01,844
and Juanita knows it and
she sees Jesse all the time,

785
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:03,127
especially at night.

786
00:55:04,924 --> 00:55:07,794
- So you've been snooping around as usual.

787
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:09,464
Well then you know.

788
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:11,844
To think that this outlaw

789
00:55:11,844 --> 00:55:16,121
with a price on his head
refuse me for that girl.

790
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:18,164
And yes, I've seen them together too.

791
00:55:18,164 --> 00:55:19,804
- So what are you gonna do, Maria?

792
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:21,297
Nothing foolish I hope?

793
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:23,967
What is in this envelope?

794
00:55:25,354 --> 00:55:29,284
- I tell you what, it's a note to Jensen,

795
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,774
the druggist in Shelby,

796
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,564
telling him that the bearer
is Jesse James the outlaw

797
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:34,994
with a price on his head.

798
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:37,238
- No, you mustn't.

799
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:38,373
You mustn't.

800
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:39,206
- Mustn't it?

801
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:40,629
Why not?

802
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,274
I would have turned him in before only--

803
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:45,697
- Only you wanted him for yourself.

804
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,296
Why, you're jealous.

805
00:55:49,296 --> 00:55:52,421
You're human after all. (laughs)

806
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:53,791
- How dare you!

807
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:08,134
- So I have to ride into Shelby

808
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:09,574
to get some medicine for Hank.

809
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,324
He's taken a turn for the worst.

810
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:12,157
- What do you mean?

811
00:56:12,157 --> 00:56:14,277
When I saw him this evening, he was fine.

812
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:18,814
Oh, they're sending you
away to get rid of you.

813
00:56:18,814 --> 00:56:21,206
- Now, why would they
try to get rid of me?

814
00:56:21,206 --> 00:56:24,707
Besides, if you're wrong,
it costs Hank his life.

815
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:30,664
- Jesse, don't trust
them, especially Maria.

816
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:32,407
Please don't go.

817
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:35,817
- I'll be back.

818
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:37,897
- Jesse!

819
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,855
(thunder booming)

820
00:56:58,074 --> 00:57:00,234
- What you're going to do is insane.

821
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:02,927
- We shall soon see which
one of us is insane.

822
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:08,184
- Besides, we should
postpone this transplantation

823
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:10,374
until he recovers from his gun wound.

824
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:11,574
- He's recovered enough.

825
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:15,104
- Maria, this is not the
same as experimenting

826
00:57:15,104 --> 00:57:16,844
on one of the village children.

827
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:20,284
Jesse James will kill us
for what you're doing.

828
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:24,814
- Jesse James will be
caught and hanged in Shelby.

829
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:26,527
Now get on with the operation.

830
00:57:37,463 --> 00:57:40,130
(ominous music)

831
00:57:43,754 --> 00:57:44,587
- Jesse.

832
00:57:53,474 --> 00:57:54,774
- While you finish preparing,

833
00:57:54,774 --> 00:57:57,214
I shall activate the artificial brain.

834
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:34,734
The brain is ready.

835
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:37,918
- Patient is ready.

836
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:38,751
- Good.

837
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,564
(thunder booming)

838
00:58:58,857 --> 00:59:00,003
(dog whining)

839
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,253
That dog!

840
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:03,054
He always senses when we operate.

841
00:59:03,054 --> 00:59:04,734
I told you to muzzle him.

842
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:06,344
- I forgot.

843
00:59:06,344 --> 00:59:07,594
I'm very upset, Maria.

844
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:09,844
I haven't your nerves.

845
00:59:09,844 --> 00:59:11,602
- Go silence him.

846
00:59:11,602 --> 00:59:12,435
- Yes.

847
00:59:13,285 --> 00:59:15,785
(dog barking)

848
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:13,924
- Now at the next stroke of lightning

849
01:00:13,924 --> 01:00:15,174
we shall have the answer.

850
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:30,717
- Don't do it, Maria.

851
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,137
You are going too far.

852
01:00:33,084 --> 01:00:35,577
No one should temper with the laws of God.

853
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,833
(electricity crackling)

854
01:01:01,844 --> 01:01:04,207
- You are no longer Hank Tracy.

855
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,216
You are Igor.

856
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:11,112
Do you understand?

857
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:11,945
Igor.

858
01:01:13,027 --> 01:01:15,527
That is how you will be known.

859
01:01:16,657 --> 01:01:18,657
I am Maria Frankenstein.

860
01:01:22,336 --> 01:01:24,586
As I think, you will think.

861
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:26,875
We are one.

862
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,920
I will command, you will obey.

863
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:36,965
You will live as long as I wish.

864
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:44,098
You will die when I command it.

865
01:01:44,098 --> 01:01:49,098
Remember, you are always under my control.

866
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:52,865
You are now Igor.

867
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:57,909
I command you to arise.

868
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:00,796
Igor.

869
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:04,127
I am Maria Frankenstein.

870
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,997
I created you.

871
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:12,728
I command you to get up.

872
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:13,811
Get up, Igor!

873
01:02:52,848 --> 01:02:54,034
Get the digitalis.

874
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:55,161
We must save him.

875
01:03:12,981 --> 01:03:13,934
Let me have it.

876
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:15,184
- No, no, no, no, no.

877
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:16,017
- Why not?

878
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:18,364
- No, we're wasting time.

879
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:22,636
(thunder booms)

880
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:23,886
- So that's it!

881
01:03:25,213 --> 01:03:26,046
No!

882
01:03:35,256 --> 01:03:36,423
Igor, save me.

883
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:38,851
Igor, save me.

884
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:41,043
Igor, save me.

885
01:03:49,156 --> 01:03:50,073
He's alive!

886
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:53,876
Get him Igor!

887
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:56,304
Get him!

888
01:03:56,304 --> 01:03:57,137
Get him!

889
01:04:07,918 --> 01:04:08,751
- Save me.

890
01:04:10,149 --> 01:04:11,888
My answer is there.

891
01:04:11,888 --> 01:04:12,721
Save me.

892
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:14,414
- You killed the others with this

893
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:18,863
to keep me from succeeding
with my experiments.

894
01:04:18,863 --> 01:04:22,280
- You have been pumping God through hell.

895
01:04:44,863 --> 01:04:47,131
- You did well, Igor.

896
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,881
Come, I want Juanita.

897
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,043
- Juanita.

898
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:53,558
- Yes, Juanita.

899
01:04:55,072 --> 01:04:55,905
- Juanita.

900
01:04:58,301 --> 01:04:59,134
Juanita.

901
01:05:00,905 --> 01:05:02,570
- Come, Igor.

902
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,403
- Juanita.

903
01:05:26,224 --> 01:05:28,957
- She's gone, probably with him.

904
01:05:30,128 --> 01:05:31,778
Well, good riddance to them both.

905
01:05:36,384 --> 01:05:38,467
But I still have you, Igor.

906
01:05:40,681 --> 01:05:41,514
Come.

907
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:20,448
(bell ringing)

908
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:48,808
- What do you want?

909
01:06:48,808 --> 01:06:50,725
- I need some medicine.

910
01:06:57,024 --> 01:06:58,311
I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning,

911
01:06:58,311 --> 01:07:00,737
but I gotta have this
medicine and get right back.

912
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,094
Something the matter?

913
01:07:17,094 --> 01:07:18,255
- No, no.

914
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:20,454
It's just that I haven't
got the medicine handy.

915
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:22,694
If you'll sit down and wait.

916
01:07:22,694 --> 01:07:23,527
- Will it take long?

917
01:07:23,527 --> 01:07:25,397
- I don't know, just sit there.

918
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:27,417
I'll be right back with the medicine.

919
01:07:50,706 --> 01:07:55,706
- (laughs) All right, let's go.

920
01:07:57,943 --> 01:08:00,144
- Well, shouldn't we wait
till Sheriff Buchanan

921
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:01,234
and the marshal get back?

922
01:08:01,234 --> 01:08:02,474
- No, I don't think so.

923
01:08:02,474 --> 01:08:04,394
They're not gonna be back for hours.

924
01:08:04,394 --> 01:08:05,227
You see, Jensen,

925
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:06,314
someone give 'em a tip

926
01:08:06,314 --> 01:08:08,714
that they knew where Jesse
James was hiding out.

927
01:08:10,475 --> 01:08:11,414
This guy you saw,

928
01:08:11,414 --> 01:08:12,247
what'd he look like?

929
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:15,864
- Medium tall, young, dark.

930
01:08:15,864 --> 01:08:17,344
Looked like he'd be riding a long way.

931
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,584
I'll tell you something else.

932
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:19,737
He looked mighty tough.

933
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,141
- Jensen, you see this?

934
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:25,794
This is made to take care of tough guys.

935
01:08:25,794 --> 01:08:27,814
- I don't wanna get
mixed up in any gun play,

936
01:08:27,814 --> 01:08:29,334
especially not in my store.

937
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:30,674
I'm a married man.

938
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:32,204
- You're gonna do exactly what I say

939
01:08:32,204 --> 01:08:33,684
and keep your mouth shut.

940
01:08:33,684 --> 01:08:35,924
- I still say, I won't
mix up in any gun play.

941
01:08:35,924 --> 01:08:38,477
Jesse James of all people.

942
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:40,394
- Now Jensen, you listen to me.

943
01:08:40,394 --> 01:08:42,894
There's $10,000 reward for Jesse James.

944
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:44,154
I'm gonna collect it,

945
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,684
and you're gonna help me.

946
01:08:45,684 --> 01:08:47,444
- What do you want me to do?

947
01:08:47,444 --> 01:08:50,474
- Nothing, absolutely nothing.

948
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:52,164
But I do want you go back over there

949
01:08:52,164 --> 01:08:54,884
and make him up some kind
of medicine, anything.

950
01:08:54,884 --> 01:08:57,078
Just act like nothing happened.

951
01:08:57,078 --> 01:08:58,627
And don't be so nervous.

952
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,704
He's liable to catch on.

953
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:01,884
- What about you?

954
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:03,934
- Don't you worry about me.

955
01:09:03,934 --> 01:09:04,767
I'll be there.

956
01:09:06,034 --> 01:09:09,014
And Jensen, I want you to listen to me

957
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:09,994
and remember this.

958
01:09:09,994 --> 01:09:11,704
If anything goes wrong,

959
01:09:11,704 --> 01:09:13,804
I'm gonna hold you personally responsible.

960
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,133
(soft mysterious music)

961
01:10:08,924 --> 01:10:10,241
- How long's it gonna take?

962
01:10:10,241 --> 01:10:11,074
- Not very long.

963
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:12,807
I gotta measure this, you know?

964
01:10:17,218 --> 01:10:19,551
(guns fire)

965
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:26,917
- I told you, Jensen. I'd get there.

966
01:10:35,424 --> 01:10:38,383
- Please, Jesse, don't shoot me.

967
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:39,874
- How did you know my name?

968
01:11:21,784 --> 01:11:22,617
Hold it!

969
01:11:24,784 --> 01:11:25,617
Juanita.

970
01:11:29,204 --> 01:11:30,644
- I came to warn you.

971
01:11:30,644 --> 01:11:31,917
You must not go back.

972
01:11:32,775 --> 01:11:33,608
- What do you mean?

973
01:11:33,608 --> 01:11:34,441
Is Hank all right?

974
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:36,124
- No, what they did to Hank,

975
01:11:36,124 --> 01:11:37,224
you can't believe it.

976
01:11:37,224 --> 01:11:38,484
It's terrible.

977
01:11:38,484 --> 01:11:41,274
If you go back, they'll
do the same thing to you.

978
01:11:41,274 --> 01:11:42,834
- What are you talking about?

979
01:11:42,834 --> 01:11:44,484
- Hank is not Hank anymore.

980
01:11:44,484 --> 01:11:45,624
- I have to go back.

981
01:11:45,624 --> 01:11:49,434
- If you do, I go to the
marshal at Shelby for help.

982
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:50,944
I know what it would mean

983
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:52,634
if I bring him back with me,

984
01:11:52,634 --> 01:11:55,584
but I'd rather see you dead
than see you looking like Hank.

985
01:11:57,304 --> 01:11:58,957
- Still, I have to go back to Hank.

986
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:02,827
- I'm sorry, Jesse.

987
01:12:03,714 --> 01:12:04,727
I must do it.

988
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:07,537
I love you too much not to.

989
01:12:14,522 --> 01:12:16,044
And that's the truth, marshal.

990
01:12:16,044 --> 01:12:18,698
Please, please believe me.

991
01:12:18,698 --> 01:12:19,531
- Too bad you didn't tell me about this

992
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:20,679
when I came to your house.

993
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:22,300
- I know, I know, I was wrong.

994
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,550
God forgive me.

995
01:12:26,349 --> 01:12:27,585
- All right, let's go.

996
01:12:27,585 --> 01:12:29,335
- Thank you, marshal.

997
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:35,934
- That's enough, Igor.

998
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:38,387
Quick, Igor, into the house.

999
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:54,824
Get in there, be quiet.

1000
01:12:54,824 --> 01:12:56,324
If I need you I will call you.

1001
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,019
Who is it?

1002
01:13:04,019 --> 01:13:04,874
What do you want?

1003
01:13:04,874 --> 01:13:05,957
- It's Jesse James.

1004
01:13:09,204 --> 01:13:10,037
Open up.

1005
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:18,854
- I'm glad you're back.

1006
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:20,774
- No thanks to you.

1007
01:13:20,774 --> 01:13:23,894
- Yes, yes I know what you're thinking,

1008
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:25,755
but it was Rudolph.

1009
01:13:25,755 --> 01:13:27,944
He forced me to write that note.

1010
01:13:27,944 --> 01:13:29,647
- I want to see Hank right now.

1011
01:13:30,543 --> 01:13:32,644
- Well, Hank is not here.

1012
01:13:32,644 --> 01:13:34,094
He and Rudolph left together.

1013
01:13:34,094 --> 01:13:35,794
- I don't believe you.

1014
01:13:35,794 --> 01:13:36,627
- I swear it.

1015
01:13:37,524 --> 01:13:38,754
- All right, if you won't
tell me where he is,

1016
01:13:38,754 --> 01:13:40,254
I'll find him.

1017
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:41,410
- Why do you treat me like this

1018
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:43,874
when you know how I feel about you?

1019
01:13:43,874 --> 01:13:46,217
- All right, I'll shake
the truth out of you.

1020
01:13:46,217 --> 01:13:47,050
- Igor!

1021
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,224
- All right, then I'll
choke it out of you!

1022
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,194
Once and for all, what did you do to Hank?

1023
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:52,267
I wanna know it!

1024
01:13:55,024 --> 01:13:56,024
- Bring him in here.

1025
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:04,125
Put him on the table.

1026
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:44,532
Igor, go to your room.

1027
01:14:47,098 --> 01:14:48,431
Your room, Igor.

1028
01:15:05,814 --> 01:15:08,174
Save your strength, Jesse James.

1029
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:09,427
You will need it.

1030
01:15:11,194 --> 01:15:16,194
Yes, I knew who you were
from the very first.

1031
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:18,964
You see, we have something in common.

1032
01:15:18,964 --> 01:15:20,757
We're both outside the law.

1033
01:15:21,904 --> 01:15:24,387
That's why I offered
you a chance to join me.

1034
01:15:26,224 --> 01:15:28,587
But you chose to refuse me.

1035
01:15:29,514 --> 01:15:32,574
You, an outlaw, refusing me,

1036
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,444
Maria Frankenstein,
granddaughter of a count.

1037
01:15:37,097 --> 01:15:39,607
I will use you in my next experiment.

1038
01:15:41,084 --> 01:15:46,084
You see, Jesse James,
I have won after all.

1039
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,558
(soft music)

1040
01:16:02,984 --> 01:16:04,064
- Where's Hank?

1041
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:04,951
What have you done with him?

1042
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,667
- You will see Hank soon.

1043
01:16:10,894 --> 01:16:12,427
Sweet dreams, Jesse James.

1044
01:16:13,274 --> 01:16:14,477
Perhaps of Juanita.

1045
01:16:23,094 --> 01:16:25,177
Now, I've got work to do.

1046
01:16:31,081 --> 01:16:33,281
- Perhaps it's better
if she doesn't see me?

1047
01:16:48,574 --> 01:16:49,835
- Who is it?

1048
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:51,585
- It's me, doctor, Marshal MacPhee.

1049
01:16:53,184 --> 01:16:54,494
- I have nothing to say.

1050
01:16:54,494 --> 01:16:55,327
Go away.

1051
01:16:55,327 --> 01:16:56,824
I'm in the midst of an
important experiment.

1052
01:16:56,824 --> 01:16:58,914
- You wait just a minute.

1053
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,503
I wanna talk to you.

1054
01:17:00,503 --> 01:17:01,734
- About what?

1055
01:17:01,734 --> 01:17:03,191
- I've been told you're
harboring Jesse James

1056
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:04,894
and Hank Tracy.

1057
01:17:04,894 --> 01:17:06,587
- Who told you such a lie?

1058
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:07,997
- Juanita Lopez.

1059
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:11,274
- (laughs) Juanita Lopez.

1060
01:17:11,274 --> 01:17:12,899
I'm surprised that you marshal

1061
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:14,524
are listening to an ignorant peasant.

1062
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:17,374
- Oh just the same, I
intend to search this place.

1063
01:17:17,374 --> 01:17:19,744
- Well, search all you care to.

1064
01:17:19,744 --> 01:17:21,679
I'll show you around myself.

1065
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:24,441
- Well, that's just
exactly what I'm gonna do.

1066
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:27,301
- Well, shall we start with my laboratory?

1067
01:17:39,277 --> 01:17:43,709
- Well Jesse, finally caught up with you.

1068
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:44,792
- Igor, Igor.

1069
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:50,516
- What did you say?

1070
01:17:50,516 --> 01:17:51,349
- Nothing.

1071
01:18:09,453 --> 01:18:11,786
(gun fires)

1072
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,290
Take him in there.

1073
01:18:45,936 --> 01:18:46,769
- Jesse!

1074
01:18:48,844 --> 01:18:52,408
Jesse, what have they done to you?

1075
01:18:52,408 --> 01:18:53,241
Jesse.

1076
01:18:54,194 --> 01:18:55,027
- Igor.

1077
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,247
Come here, quick!

1078
01:19:00,437 --> 01:19:01,604
Get her, Igor.

1079
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,140
Get Juanita.

1080
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:10,607
Juanita.

1081
01:19:17,396 --> 01:19:18,798
- [Juanita] Hank.

1082
01:19:18,798 --> 01:19:19,631
- Juanita.

1083
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:23,078
- Kill Juanita.

1084
01:19:23,078 --> 01:19:23,911
Kill her.

1085
01:19:25,546 --> 01:19:26,629
Kill Juanita.

1086
01:19:29,828 --> 01:19:31,078
- Jesse, Jesse.

1087
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:37,492
- Juanita.

1088
01:19:38,638 --> 01:19:39,721
- No, please!

1089
01:19:43,757 --> 01:19:44,840
- Kill, kill.

1090
01:19:46,367 --> 01:19:47,729
- Hank!

1091
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:50,396
(intense music)

1092
01:20:09,978 --> 01:20:13,627
- Hank, it's me, Jesse, Hank.

1093
01:20:15,114 --> 01:20:17,727
- Kill, kill.

1094
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:22,504
- No Hank, it's me,
Jesse James, your friend.

1095
01:20:22,504 --> 01:20:23,337
Hank.

1096
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:26,920
Hank.

1097
01:20:28,274 --> 01:20:30,217
Hank, don't make me kill you.

1098
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:32,745
- Ah!

1099
01:20:39,411 --> 01:20:40,244
Hank!

1100
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:51,265
(gun fires)

1101
01:20:59,724 --> 01:21:03,247
Oh Jesse, I thought he would kill you.

1102
01:21:05,465 --> 01:21:06,298
- Juanita.

1103
01:21:15,919 --> 01:21:16,752
Juanita.

1104
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:28,501
- Oh, Jesse.

1105
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,723
(soft music)

1106
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,817
Our village is free once more.

1107
01:21:55,804 --> 01:21:58,907
Thanks to you and Hank.

1108
01:21:59,864 --> 01:22:01,557
My people will come back here.

1109
01:22:02,804 --> 01:22:07,187
Jesse, I will be waiting for you here.

1110
01:22:08,484 --> 01:22:09,317
- No, Juanita.

1111
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:11,985
Look, I am an outlaw with
a rope waiting for me.

1112
01:22:11,985 --> 01:22:15,119
- That's not what I want to hear.

1113
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:18,119
(soft guitar music)

1114
01:22:27,334 --> 01:22:28,434
- I love you, Juanita.

1115
01:22:29,869 --> 01:22:33,452
(majestic orchestra music)

1116
01:22:44,105 --> 01:22:48,522
(Juanita speaks in foreign language)

1117
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:50,867
- Go with God.
