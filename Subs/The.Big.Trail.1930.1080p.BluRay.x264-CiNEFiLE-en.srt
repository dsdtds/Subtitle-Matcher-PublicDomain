1
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,440
I wonder what's holding them up.

3
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Don't worry about that, Father.
We'll be going soon.

4
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,600
John, did you feed them hounds?
Yes, Grandpa, yes.

5
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
All right.
Now tighten her up, Son.

6
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,000
She'll take us where we're going.

7
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,960
Yes, but where are we going?

8
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Now, Ma, they're thrashin' that
matter out over there now.

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
Pa, they made you the leader.

10
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,480
Why don't you say where to go?

11
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,800
I'm only leader of
the Missourians, Daughter.

12
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,080
There are families here from every
state in the Union, I reckon.

13
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,240
Can't be waitin' on
'em forever, Dad.

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,360
No, Son.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,720
They're holding a powwow
over there now.

16
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,600
I'll just step over and see
what they got to say.

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,040
Well, bless our wild heart.
If it ain't Breck Coleman.

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,920
How are you, Zeke?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,920
Where at you been hidin' yourself
for the last year, boy?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Been down Santa Fe way, Zeke.
Just drifted in.

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,360
And here's Windy Bill.
Looks like you've

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,880
wintered through in good shape.

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,920
Well, Coleman, most times I
winter through in fair shape.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,520
This year, when the first grass
showed, I'd only put on 60 pounds.

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,000
Say, Bascom, he maybe could

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,320
tell us of a likely
stretch of country.

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,720
Breck, could you sight us to a second
Missouri anywheres out yonder?

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,320
Sure. But it's a long,
tough pull from here.

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,200
2,500 mile the way
you'd have to go.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,280
No, it's too far off.

31
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,680
No place is too far
if it's what we want.

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
This is a land beyond Oregon.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,960
There ain't no land
beyond Oregon, mister.

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,720
West of Oregon comes the ocean,
way it's been told to me.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,640
This stretch is north of Oregon.

36
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,840
How many people settled on it now?

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
It's Indian country.

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Except for the trappers, never a
white man has left his track there.

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,320
Only one trading post
in that whole country.

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Who owns it?

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
A Missouri trapper owns it.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,560
Hey, mister, will you tell me this...

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,320
Hey, hey, there.

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,440
Since you all
elected me the he-coon

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
of this outfit,
let me do the talking.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,720
It's everything a Missourian's
heart could crave.

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,880
There's two snow-capped mountain
ranges with peaks lost in the sky.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
And between them ranges, men,
is a great valley.

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,840
Lakes and streams everywhere.

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,080
Fish, you ask, and game?

51
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
There's salmon
swarmin' up them rivers

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,320
thicker than blackbirds
in a cane patch.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
Friend, will you undertake
to lead us to that valley?

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,280
I'd like nothin' better, men...

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,640
But our trails fork here.

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,920
I've got business that calls me

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,800
back down the road Santa Fe way.

58
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,200
What business do
you follow, friend?

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
I'm a trapper.

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, surely there's fur aplenty

61
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
out in that land beyond Oregon.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
Plenty.

63
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,520
But I gotta kill me
a pair of skunks,

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,440
back apiece on
the road to Santa Fe.

65
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,480
Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how
do you find that valley?

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
Wellmore here is
sending a bull train clear

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,440
through to old Tom Williams's
trading post.

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,680
First time it's ever been tried.

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,200
String along behind them and, if they
make it through, you'll find your valley.

70
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,080
And tell that great white
mountain hello for me.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,480
Good-bye, Zeke.

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,840
Well, thanks, boy.

73
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,400
Hey!

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,960
Hey, maybe he fed us a fairy tale.

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,520
Now don't be a pig, you know.

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,680
Howdy, Mrs. Riggs.

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
Land's sakes!

78
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, you sure look fine,
Mother Riggs.

79
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,920
It's a long time
since I've seen you.

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,440
You know, you always was
a great hand to wander.

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah, I ramble around.

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,080
And how are the little twins?

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
Little? My lands!

84
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Them girls has grown
since you seen 'em last.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,840
No!

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,040
They in the house?

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Mildred is. Elise went down
to watch the boat come in.

88
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,160
I reckon I'll saunter in
and surprise Mildred.

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
You sure will surprise them.

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,240
Well, Breck, I sure am
glad to see you.

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,200
Well, you certainly
have doubled in size

92
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,160
since last I set
eyes on you, Mildred.

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
You just must see Elise.

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll surely see her before I leave.

95
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
<i>There's the
Peensie Bell whistling now.</i>

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Look at the crowd.

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Look.

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,040
Okay. I guess it is
important to have everything ready.

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
I have everything ready.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Well, Miss Cameron, we be
landin' in a few minutes.

101
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,400
Got all your outfit together?

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
Most everything's ready,
Captain Hollister.

103
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,040
Listen, why don't you give up
this plan and turn back?

104
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,800
Why, there's no place
to turn back to.

105
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,160
Why, there isn't a home in all the South
that wouldn't welcome the daughter

106
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,280
of Colonel Cameron.

107
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,440
True. But we can hardly
become perpetual visitors.

108
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,560
It's a tough proposition, girl,

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,320
this pioneer life in
a savage wilderness.

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
We realize that, Captain Hollister,

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,640
but we must keep
the family together.

112
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,920
Honey Girl wants to stay with
her sister Ruth, doesn't she?

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Yes, I do.

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,160
And our brother Dave's
almost a man grown.

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,080
Ruth is right, Captain. The Cameron
tribe must stick together.

116
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,080
Say, you're
just the fella I want to see.

117
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,840
I want to play some more
of that shell game.

118
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
Have you got any more money?

119
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
Sure I got some money.

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
Where'd you get that?

121
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,880
From my mother-in-law.

122
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,480
She lend it to me,
but she don't know it.

123
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,120
Here, I'll meet you below deck.
Get along.

124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Don't forget.
I wait there for you.

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,760
Are you still determined
to be a sturdy pioneer?

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,320
Quite determined,
Mr. Thorpe.

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,200
I've told you about
my plantation in Louisiana.

128
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,240
It must be wonderful.

129
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,560
Miss Cameron, those lands
and servants are yours,

130
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,600
if you'll take me with them.

131
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,600
Why, I do thank you. But as I've
said before, it's quite impossible.

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,640
Good-bye, Mr. Thorpe.

133
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,600
Now, if I win,
I'm going to keep it.

134
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,640
But if I lose, I give
my mother-in-law half.

135
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,000
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Here we are again.

136
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,200
Hello, Thorpe.

137
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,960
Well, Gussie, you want to see the
elusive little ball under the shells.

138
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,600
There you are. Now it's bound
to be under one of them.

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,920
There's one, there's two,
and there's three.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,160
Now we'll shuffle them just a
little bit, just to confuse you.

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,120
And take your choice.

142
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Now wait, I show you.
Here, I bet you two dollars.

143
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,400
Two dollars. Covered.

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,960
I always do that for good luck.

145
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,040
Now wait. I show you.
Now watch.

146
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,280
You see, Gussie, the
hand is faster than the eye.

147
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
Better luck next time.

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,880
Here. Who wants to buy
my mother-in-law's stocking?

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,040
Gus!

150
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,520
There you are. What do you
mean by spending my money?

151
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
But, Mama, I'm going
to give you half.

152
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Give me my money.

153
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
Give it to her.

154
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Hurry UP-

155
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Give me the rest of it.

156
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
Why, madam, that's my own money.

157
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,600
That's my money.

158
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,040
No, no, Mama.
That's his money.

159
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,040
Captain, I demand that
that man give me my money.

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,040
Hand it over.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,840
See, Mama? Didn't I
tell you we would win?

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,080
Why, you big loafer! Get out of here!
Spending my life's earnings!

163
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,600
Now, Thorpe,
you get off of my boat.

164
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,000
If you set foot on it again,
I'll put you in irons

165
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,560
and land you at St. Charles
on my way back.

166
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,360
Davey, I think I better
go find Mrs. Riggs,

167
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
that lady Captain Hollister
told us about.

168
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
Come on, Honey Girl.

169
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
No. I want to stay here with
Davey and watch them unload.

170
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
Well, you take good
care of her, Davey.

171
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,200
I will.

172
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
I'll be right back, Honey Girl.

173
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,680
It's a nice place, ain't it, Mama?

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,880
It's terrible!
Look at the mud!

175
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,480
Well, listen, Mama, I gonna
go see if I can buy a horse.

176
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,400
Come on. Come on.
I carry you over there.

177
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,560
I don't want you to get your feet wet.
That's it. Here we go.

178
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,640
Now you stay there.
I bring Abbie over.

179
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,560
Come on, Abbie. I don't want you
to get your shoes all muddy.

180
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,720
That's it.
Come on. Here we go.

181
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,080
Stop laughing, will you, Abbie?

182
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,240
That's it. Now you wait here.
I bring Mama.

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,000
Come on, Mama.
I take you over, Mama.

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Come on, Mama.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,240
Come on, Mama. It's...

186
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,760
Here! What are
you trying to do?

187
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,080
But, Mama,
I want to carry you across

188
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
so you won't get your feet wet.

189
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,760
You? I'll cross
my own mud.

190
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,000
All right then, Mama, but let me help you.
That's it, Mama. Come on now.

191
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,800
Okay, step on that board, Mama.
That's it, Mama.

192
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,440
Say, I come right back.

193
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,040
Gus!

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,080
Mrs. Riggs?

195
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
Yes, miss. That's me.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,720
Well, I'm Miss Cameron. Captain
Hollister told me to see you.

197
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Friend of Captain Hollister?

198
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Yes, lam.

199
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
Come right on in.
Thank you.

200
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,800
Now don't tear your pretty
dress on them logs.

201
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,040
It's nice and cool
in here out of the sun.

202
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,080
Now you sit down,
make yourself easy,

203
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,560
and I'll brew you a cup of tea.

204
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,880
That's awfully nice of
you, Mrs. Riggs. Thank you.

205
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
No! Wha...

206
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,240
Why, what do you mean by...

207
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,280
I thought...

208
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,840
It was thisaway, ma'am, I
thought you were someone else.

209
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,200
Wait! It was thisaway. I
thought you were Elise, ma'am.

210
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Elise?

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
Yes. Just thought
I'd surprise her sort of.

212
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
Did you indeed?

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,400
Let me tell ya.

214
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,600
If you'll light someplace,
I'll tell ya.

215
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
What is it?
You're as pale as a ghost.

216
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,440
It's nothing,
Mr. Thorpe. Really. I...

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,400
But there must be something wrong.
Nothing.

218
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,400
Just an unpleasant occurrence.

219
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
I'm gonna explain that play.

220
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
There's nothing to explain.

221
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,400
But I'm gonna tell you anyhow.

222
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
It seems to me you're forcing
yourself on this lady.

223
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,920
Is that how it seems to you?

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
How else can I take it?

225
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
It's nothing to me how you take it.

226
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,680
But it matters a heap to me,
ma'am, how you understand.

227
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
Perhaps not. But if it
concerns Miss Cameron,

228
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
I'll demand an explanation.

229
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,760
You will?
Then speak your piece.

230
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,040
Mr. Thorpe, will... Will you
please take me to my brother?

231
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,560
With pleasure. I'll be
looking for you shortly.

232
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,520
Well, I won't be hard to locate.

233
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,960
Hello, Honey Girl.

234
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,280
Hello.

235
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,040
Thank you so much,
Mr. Thorpe.

236
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
It's a great pleasure.

237
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Just think. This wagon will be
your home for the next six months.

238
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,880
And after that,
a cabin in the wilderness.

239
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,240
My mind is made up,
Mr. Thorpe.

240
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
We're going with the settlers.

241
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
You know my brother David.

242
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes.

243
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
Hello, Dave.

244
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,280
How do you do?

245
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,800
Howdy, DOV!

246
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,760
Hello, Zeke.
Howdy, Bill.

247
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,200
Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you
about this here boy Coleman.

248
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,320
He can heave a knife
into a mark so big every time.

249
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
I'll bet you
a buffalo hide he can't

250
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,080
heave it into that post back of ya.

251
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,320
Call the bet! Now here.
Show him, boy.

252
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,080
Bless our wild heart!

253
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,680
I've seen him do it
a hundred times, Bill?

254
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,640
That's another buffalo hide
you owe me, Jack.

255
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,280
You remember, Bill, that time
up, on the Snake River...

256
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,720
I sure do.

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,040
Say, boy, I want to know
about old Ben Griswell.

258
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,400
I hear the Indians downed him.

259
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,400
Only it wasn't Injuns downed him.

260
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,920
No?

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,160
Renegade whites done it.

262
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,360
How come?

263
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,000
He'd been wolf in' all winter.

264
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Yeah?

265
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,880
Must've had $2,000, $3,000
worth of wolf pelts.

266
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
Easy that.

267
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
He was hacked up
and stuck full of arrows.

268
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,440
Looked like Injun work, all right.

269
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,640
The wolf pelts was gone.

270
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,720
If ever I find them hellhounds,

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,240
I'll sure make 'em
hunt their holes.

272
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,680
Come on.

273
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,640
Lopez, who's that young buck over
there with no hair on his face?

274
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,360
That's, Breck Coleman.
He very quick with his knife.

275
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,280
Where's he come from?

276
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,440
He come from the plains,
the mountains.

277
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,360
He live with the Indians.

278
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,400
He can throw a knife
through the heart in 20 feet.

279
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,600
He's the best shot
in all this country.

280
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,520
He knows everything.

281
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,320
He'll know too much
for his own good someday.

282
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,560
Yes. All right.

283
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,400
If old Ben had lived, he'd be going
on about 72 now, wouldn't he?

284
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,760
Injuns never done this.

285
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
It was renegade whites.

286
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,920
And they've left their mark.

287
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,320
I'd say I do.

288
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,680
Say, Zeke, who was that
he-grizzly that just went by?

289
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,920
Why, that's Red Flack. He's
bullwhackin' for Wellmore.

290
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
He's gonna whack Wellmore's
train clear through to Oregon.

291
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,800
You reckon you'll ever find
out who downed old Ben?

292
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,160
It's just possible that a certain
low-down coyote left his sign there.

293
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,160
Well, hello, Coleman.

294
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,520
Howdy, Wellmore.

295
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,480
I've changed my mind. I'll scout
for that bull train after all.

296
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,440
Well, that's a ray of sunshine.

297
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,840
Shake hands afore you
change your mind again.

298
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,320
Got a good wagon boss for the trip?

299
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,720
Red Flack.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
A burly ruffian, but he can maul

301
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,840
the toughest traitor on
the plains into a pulp

302
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,840
without even working up a sweat.

303
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
He can do that?

304
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,360
Flack? Ha!

305
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,680
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run

306
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,960
a bull train.
Here he comes now.

307
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,240
Well, Wellmore, all ready to start?

308
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,680
Likely you two have met before.

309
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,040
Nah.

310
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
I reckon not.

311
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Coleman's gonna scout for the train.

312
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,000
You understand, Flack,

313
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,400
that he's to have final say in all
matters dealing with the Indians.

314
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes? Well, who's got the final say
about bossin' this bull train?

315
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,560
He understands that
you're the wagon boss.

316
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,560
Yeah. Another thing,
another thing...

317
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,920
Am I supposed to
be wet nurse to them

318
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,120
woodenhead pilgrims
a-crossin' the plains?

319
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
The more that goes along,
the better it is

320
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,240
for them and you
in case Indians jump ya.

321
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,560
Well, all right.
All right!

322
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,160
Make it clear to him
that I'm wagon boss.

323
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,680
He understands that, Flack.

324
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,400
He seems to be
a right pleasant cuss.

325
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,920
He's a ruffian,
but he's a real wagon boss.

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,920
Likely he is.

327
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Must've done a big trade
in wolf pelts this year.

328
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,320
Yes, we had a big trade
with the wolfers.

329
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,680
Flack sell you any of these?

330
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,960
Flack? No. He didn't do any
wolfing last winter, I guess.

331
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,800
What outfit did you buy
the biggest bunch from?

332
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Fella name of Lopez
come in about a month ago

333
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,520
with close on to
5,000 dollars' worth.

334
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,160
Lopez, I guess I don't know him.

335
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,320
I signed him up as a
bullwhacker on the train.

336
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,360
You did?

337
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,520
I'll see you next year.

338
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,160
Bring your scalp along back whole.

339
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,520
All right. Good-bye.

340
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,840
Is that so?

341
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,880
It certainly is.

342
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,120
I don't know whether they're
gonna get through or not...

343
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,320
Windy, I'm gonna scout
for that bull train.

344
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,040
Good.

345
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,000
Mr. Cameron,
this is Mr. Coleman.

346
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
Howdy, Mr. Coleman.
How do you do, sir?

347
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,320
He can tell you more about
that country where you're going,

348
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,720
and what kind of an outfit you
need than any man around here.

349
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,320
Thanks.

350
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,720
Windy, throw my bags in with
yours and Zeke's, will ya?

351
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,160
All right, I'll do.

352
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,560
Tell Zeke I'm going along.

353
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
All right, boy.

354
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,000
Mr. Coleman, would you mind
looking over my outfit?

355
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,320
Certainly not. We'll go
have a peek at it. Where is it?

356
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Right over there, sir.

357
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,560
Honey Girl, it's time for
your history lesson, dear.

358
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,960
Now, how many stars in the flag?

359
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,480
Twenty-six.

360
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,400
How many stripes?

361
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,240
Thirty.

362
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.

363
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,960
And what do they stand for?

364
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,800
The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.

365
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
Now, who discovered
the Columbia River?

366
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,800
Here's our outfit.

367
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,280
Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.
Robert Gray.

368
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
Honey Girl, it isn't safe to
be sitting in a rocking chair,

369
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,600
when there are
certain persons present.

370
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,720
I think you'll find
we have everything.

371
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,120
Plenty of guns?

372
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,360
A rifle and a fowling piece.

373
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,680
How about ammunition?

374
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,960
Plenty.

375
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,240
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.

376
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,280
A barrel?

377
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,040
Yeah, you'll need a water barrel.

378
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,760
There'll be long
stretches without water.

379
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,320
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.

380
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,760
All right.

381
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,080
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...

382
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,320
The folks right next
there had an extra one.

383
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,520
Quick work, son.

384
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,160
Say, it wouldn't be a bad
idea to take two barrels.

385
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,960
Suppose you go rustle another one.

386
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll do that.

387
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,160
When I came romping into
the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...

388
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
How's this one?

389
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Well, that's fine.

390
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,360
Looks like barrels
grow on trees around here.

391
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,240
Mr. Cameron, you better tell your
sister to change that pretty dress.

392
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,160
She won't get very far in that.

393
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
Yes, sir.

394
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,280
Put on some traveling clothes.

395
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,760
Let's have a peek around here.

396
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,200
We have a trailer,

397
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,400
in case we needed...

398
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,320
I like him better
than Mr. Thorpe.

399
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,040
Honey Girl, we'll finish
your history lesson.

400
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,880
I know how that is.

401
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,280
Well, you won't...

402
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,200
Thorpe!

403
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,640
<i>Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie
Bell and make yourself scarce.</i>

404
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
If you're here when
the boat pulls out,

405
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,960
the boys will certainly lead
your pony out from under you.

406
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,320
Why, I had no intention of staying.

407
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
<i>I'll be on the Peensie Bell
when she leaves.</i>

408
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,440
You see that you are.

409
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,120
My goodness. I don't know what
I'm going to do with you.

410
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,040
Well, I try again. Come on.
Here. Up you go. Up.

411
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,680
You stubborn jackass. I
give you a "yab" in the "yaw."

412
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,320
I bet you "yump." Come on.

413
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Up.

414
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,640
Hello there, Gus. What do you
call that thing you got there?

415
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
His name is Jack.

416
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,920
Jack? Yes.
But that's only half of it.

417
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
Well, see,
he's only a half a horse.

418
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,040
Well... What's the matter?
Can't you get him up?

419
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,640
I don't know. I pull and I
pull, but he won't come up.

420
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,520
Wait. Wait. I got an idea.

421
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,240
Say, what did you say to him then?

422
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,280
I told him a joke
about my mother-in-law.

423
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,480
Gus!

424
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,600
Wait. Here she comes.

425
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,960
Gus, what have you got there?

426
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,120
This is my new horse.
I just bought him.

427
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,040
You bought him?
Sure.

428
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,840
Say, ya...

429
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,480
That wasn't me, Mama.
No, it was the mule.

430
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,560
That rum's for you and me?

431
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,720
<i>Gracias.</i>

432
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe?

433
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,720
I always thought you was
hung and planted years back.

434
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,440
No, my time ain't
arrived yet, Flack.

435
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Yeah.

436
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,640
Though it looks as though
it might be drawing close.

437
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,600
How come?

438
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,600
Well, I've been
promised a hanging bee

439
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,520
<i>if I don't get out
on the Peensie Bell.</i>

440
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,240
And the captain promised me a necktie
party if I set foot on the boat.

441
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
It's a case of nowhere to go.

442
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,800
Yeah. It appears to me you do
your shooting by daylight,

443
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,560
with too many people looking on?

444
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,800
Well, long as you can't go
and you can't stay,

445
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,360
just what do you figure
to do about it?

446
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Well, I've always been
able to wiggle out.

447
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,280
Yeah. Appears to me as if you
was born to be drowned?

448
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,520
Come on, Zeke.
Get rid of that moonshine,

449
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
and let's get out in the sunshine.

450
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,440
All right, big boy.

451
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,360
Hold your head up.
Don't leave me.

452
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,280
Yeah, so long, folks.
See you next year.

453
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
Yeah.

454
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,560
Are you just as handy
with a gun as you was?

455
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,200
I can drive a nail at 30 paces.

456
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,400
Yeah.

457
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,000
Well, as long as you can't go,

458
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,360
and you can't stay...

459
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,120
Wouldn't be a bad idea if you
was to go along with me.

460
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,160
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Yeah.

461
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Where do you happen
to be headed for?

462
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,920
Well, anyways, it's out there,

463
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,160
where there ain't no noose
awaitin' for you?

464
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,080
Hello, Breck.

465
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,680
Well, Windy, I trapped
him with his jug down at Joe's.

466
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,720
Hey, Windy, here's the last

467
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,960
you'll see of civilization
for a long time.

468
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,120
That's worth tryin'.

469
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Hey! Back up here,
will ya? Back up.

470
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,000
I gotta finish that with Windy.

471
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Hey, that's what you get
for not drinkin' with me.

472
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
I'll drink at your next wedding.

473
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Yeah!

474
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
Windy...

475
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,640
Do some of them musical things,
will you, with your mouth?

476
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,600
That's old stuff.

477
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Dab, no. Something new.

478
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Well.

479
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,880
A coyote.

480
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,240
That's no coyote.

481
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,320
There's the stuff! Hey!

482
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Hey, did you
ever kill a dead Indian?

483
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,720
No, I never killed a dead one.

484
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,440
Before they was dead, did ya?

485
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,280
No. You see, the Injuns
are my friends.

486
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,040
They taught me all I know
about the woods.

487
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,200
They taught me how to follow a
trail by watching the leaves.

488
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,600
And how to cut your mark on a tree

489
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,000
so you won't get lost
in the forest.

490
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
And they taught me how
to burry in in the snow,

491
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,240
so you won't freeze
to death in the storms.

492
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,400
And they taught me how to make
a fire without even a flint.

493
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,320
How could you do that?

494
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,920
And they taught me how to make
the best bow and arrows too.

495
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,560
Did they teach you
how to make papooses?

496
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,320
No, that's
one of their own secrets.

497
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,840
Well, boys, I guess
we better get going.

498
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,480
O God, our Father,

499
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,800
as you sit on high and look
down on us poor mortals,

500
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
forgive our frailties.

501
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
I am about to lead these people

502
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,480
into a wild and dangerous country.

503
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,040
Give me strength and wisdom,
0 God, to lead them through.

504
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,360
Where's my steps?

505
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,640
Mama, I got everything
packed up in the wagon.

506
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
But how can I get
into the wagon, you idiot?

507
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,320
Well, look, I show you. Look,
Mama, put your feets up on there.

508
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,240
That's it. Now wait. I lift. That's...
Up you go, Mama. That's it.

509
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,200
Now one more foot up. Now up, Mama.
Up, Mama. That's it. Up.

510
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,040
Wait, Mama. You're sitting
on my head, Mama.

511
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,960
Please... There you go.

512
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
Get in. Get in, folks.
We're goin'.

513
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,840
Mount up. We're goin' now.
Get in there.

514
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,640
We're on our way.

515
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,480
Pull out!

516
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,640
Give us a song!

517
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,680
All right.

518
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,720
We're off, boys.

519
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,240
<i>Sam's got a wooden
leg below the knee</i>

520
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,680
<i>Sam's got a wooden leg
below the knee</i>

521
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,000
Mule!

522
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,760
Never mind! I
walk there, Useless. Come on.

523
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,880
You want these sacks, don't ya?

524
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,400
Trade cattle.

525
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,640
Hyah! Hyah!

526
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
About time we were movin' on.

527
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,560
Yeah.

528
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,560
Willy!

529
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,120
Come on, Willy. Forward!

530
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,000
Giddyap!

531
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,440
Giddyap!
Giddyap!

532
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,080
Hyah! Hyah! Move out!

533
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,840
Yeah! Yee!

534
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,960
You make me so tired!
Get over there!

535
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm tired of this!

536
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,880
Fi!

537
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,880
Get up here!

538
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,320
Get along here!

539
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,360
Get in there!
Get on! Go on!

540
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,560
Howdy, Dave.

541
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,720
Hello, Coleman.

542
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,240
Miss Cameron...

543
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,920
Glad to see you took my advice
about saving that pretty dress.

544
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,760
You look so nice in it,
it'd be a shame to spoil it.

545
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,000
Looking for anyone in particular?

546
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,000
Honey Girl, a gentleman never comes

547
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,720
to a lady's home
when he isn't wanted.

548
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,880
Out here, this wagon's
our only home.

549
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,440
Pony, that means us.

550
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,240
Come on, Useless.
What's the matter?

551
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,080
Come here, Useless.

552
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,120
Hey, there.

553
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,640
Wait. Wait.

554
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,000
Get in...
Get in there.

555
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,480
Get in there!
Giddyap!

556
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,040
Come on. Get in there!

557
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,840
Come on, Useless.
This way.

558
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,760
Git!

559
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,800
Wait a minute, Useless.

560
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,280
Come on, Useless.
Come on, Useless. Come on.

561
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,280
What do you think
of this fella Thorpe?

562
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,440
I've seen that there
squawker somewheres afore.

563
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,720
Can't recollect just where.

564
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,160
He, shoots a kind of a nasty
look at you once in a while, boy.

565
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,880
We had a run-in
the first day.

566
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,520
Yeah?

567
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,560
You know, he ain't no settler.

568
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,760
Nah.

569
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,040
And he ain't no bullwhacker.

570
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,120
Wonder what he come along for.

571
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,880
Aha! He come along, 'cause
of that, Cameron girl.

572
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,160
I'm still mystified,
Mr. Thorpe,

573
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,960
why you came here instead of
returning to your plantation.

574
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,160
I've told you why I came.

575
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,840
I induced Captain Hollister,
an old friend of mine,

576
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,120
to put back to shore,
and I followed you.

577
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,040
Yes, I know that's
what you told me.

578
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,800
But I'm afraid you're a flatterer.

579
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,840
On my honor, no.

580
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,680
You got a chew of tobacco?

581
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Hey, Lopez! Tobacco's gonna
be mighty scarce later on.

582
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,360
Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy
Bill and get a slug of "come on."

583
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,760
Your name's Lopez?

584
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Lopez, that's me.

585
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,800
You and Flack good friends,
he tells me.

586
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Flack and me
been friends 12, 15 years.

587
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,880
You were out wolfing
together last winter?

588
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,600
No, no, no. Wolfing, she not
good business. No money.

589
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,800
Then you didn't get many?

590
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,120
No, not much.

591
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Funny. Wellmore said
you sold him

592
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,240
more furs than any other
half dozen outfits.

593
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,160
No. He must have been talking
about someone else. Not me.

594
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,120
Well, no matter.
See you often.

595
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,400
You rascal.

596
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,440
Flack.

597
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,760
Got a good bunch
of bullwhackers, Flack.

598
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,440
That, Lopez
strikes me as a good hand.

599
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,320
You bet.
Lopez can pound them along.

600
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,560
You and him old friends?

601
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,520
Who? Lopez and me?

602
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,160
Nah. I never see'd him
till he signed on this trip.

603
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,960
My mistake.

604
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,520
Lopez.

605
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,840
I don't like this man Coleman.

606
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,000
Yeah?

607
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,080
If he asks after me, you
tell him you never see'd me,

608
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,200
till you signed on this trip.

609
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
You're too late.

610
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Why?

611
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,880
He just speak to me, and I
tell him we was old friends.

612
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,800
What?

613
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,520
What do you use under your
hat instead of brains?

614
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,240
You need no brains if you got this.

615
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,480
Now you're talking sense.

616
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,600
Come on, you.
Come on. Giddyap.

617
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
<i>Pick your partner
and a-promenade back.</i>

618
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,120
<i>First couple out to the right
and follow the ca...</i>

619
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,800
Prepare to promenade back.

620
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,520
First couple out to the right
and follow the call.

621
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,560
Now right in circles.

622
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,920
Take your partner
and a-promenade back.

623
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
First couple out to the right
and follow the call.

624
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,880
Maybe she won't, talk with him,

625
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,920
but she'll dance with him?

626
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,560
It's a lovely dance.

627
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,080
On with the next
and follow the call.

628
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,440
And a lovely night.

629
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,560
And a lovely girl.

630
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,760
Now's your chance. Go in and
snag her away from him.

631
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,320
I claim the favor.

632
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,640
With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.

633
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Well, Zeke.

634
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Hello, boy.

635
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,840
Thorpe just stole my partner and
left me dancing with myself.

636
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,200
Yeah?

637
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Say, boy, it just come to me
a minute ago,

638
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,160
where I seen that
there Thorpe before.

639
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,200
Where?

640
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Camped on the Cimarron with
Flack and Lopez. They're old friends.

641
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,840
Are you sure of that?
Dead certain.

642
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,880
So keep your eye
peeled on him, son.

643
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,880
I'm tired. I think
I'll go to my wagon.

644
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,920
Why, certainly.
Let me take you there.

645
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
And to think this
same moon is shining

646
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,160
on my old plantation in Louisiana.

647
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,520
All it needs is a lovely
woman to preside there.

648
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,320
Someday you'll find her.

649
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,040
I have found her, Ruth.

650
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,600
Please, Mr. Thorpe.
Look, I've told you before

651
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,360
that there can be
no happiness without love.

652
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
But love will come.

653
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,080
Ruth... I'm really
tired, Mr. Thorpe.

654
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,440
Do you mind if I go to bed?
Good night.

655
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,040
Good night.

656
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,880
We're getting into
dangerous country, Flack...

657
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,120
So I'll be riding to the Pawnee
villages to pick up some Injun scouts.

658
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,760
Yes? Well, you're likely to
lose your scalp out there.

659
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,440
I'll bet you a couple of wolf
pelts I bring it back with me.

660
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
How long'll you be gone, Coleman?

661
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,000
Three or four days, a week maybe.

662
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,000
Back so soon?

663
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,280
I thought maybe you wouldn't
be coming back at all.

664
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,600
And just why did you think that?

665
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,040
Well, after I sort of took the
dark-eyed beauty away from you,

666
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,400
I thought you might be decamping.

667
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,120
Listen, Thorpe. I never quit a
job in the middle of the road.

668
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,440
Quite so.
Quite so.

669
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,840
But after the girl quit you
in the middle of the road...

670
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,080
Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!

671
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,960
I know who you are now,

672
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,760
and I know why you quit
the Cimarron country too.

673
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,400
Well. No necessity to
have quarrels among friends.

674
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,960
Friends?
You threw too wide a loop.

675
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,000
Remember this, the three of you...

676
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,400
I'm not your friend.

677
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,320
Yeah. Well, you let him
scare you stiff.

678
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,240
Not at all.

679
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,600
Only an idiot, you know,
presses a quarrel,

680
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,240
when the other man has a knife
pressed against his middle.

681
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,600
Yeah. Good excuse.

682
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,280
Wolf pelts?

683
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,320
What does that mean?

684
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,520
Don't mean nothin'.

685
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,840
It doesn't to me,
but it does to you.

686
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,880
Yeah? Where'd you get
that notion?

687
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,200
When he mentioned
wolf pelts, you looked

688
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,280
as though he'd rammed
a knife in you.

689
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,200
Not exactly
what I'd call a poker face.

690
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,360
Yeah?
Well, what of it?

691
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,760
Nothing.

692
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,200
Only I'm beginning to understand
why you don't like Coleman.

693
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
Bye, Windy.

694
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,000
And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the
happy hunting grounds if not before.

695
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,160
Good luck, boy.

696
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,320
Bye.

697
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,280
Well, Miss Ruth, I got
some good news for you.

698
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,520
What?

699
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm gonna be away for a while.
I'm going scoutin'.

700
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,960
Well, isn't that dangerous
in the open country?

701
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,640
Lord, no. I love it...

702
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,120
Especially now that it's spring
and everything's so happy.

703
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,240
Why, there's trees
out there, big, tall pines...

704
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,400
Just a-reachin'
and a-reachin'...

705
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,920
As if they wanted to climb right
through the gates of heaven.

706
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,640
And there's brooks, too, with
the water smiling all day long.

707
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,840
But the part I like best
is the night...

708
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,040
Lying out there beneath
a blanket of stars,

709
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,480
with that old moon
smiling down on you.

710
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,080
And every time you look up,
there she is,

711
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,560
sort of guarding over you, like
a mother minding her young.

712
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,240
Sometimes it's so beautiful that
I just lie there, listening.

713
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,880
Birds singing, brooks laughing,

714
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,280
and the wind sort of
crooning through the forest.

715
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,520
Like some great organ.

716
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,720
I've always loved it.

717
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,360
But I reckon I'm gonna be
lonely this time.

718
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,840
You know, you can get sort of used
to having somebody not like you.

719
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,120
And when they're not around,
you miss them not liking you.

720
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,480
That's why I reckon
I'm gonna be lonesome.

721
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,160
But I'll be thinking of you.

722
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,160
Good-bye.

723
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,640
And you just take care
you don't lose your scalp!

724
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
Zeke, is he leaving the train?

725
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Yes, miss. He's riding out
to Pawnee villages.

726
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, how far are they?

727
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,280
Nigh on a hundred mile.

728
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,960
Well, isn't that dangerous?

729
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,560
Well, he's likely to lose his
scalp afore he gets there.

730
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,720
But once in the villages,
he's safe.

731
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,960
So don't you worry about him, miss.

732
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,440
What... Why should
I worry about him?

733
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,760
I don't know, miss.
I don't know.

734
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
But seemed like as
if maybe you was.

735
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,160
Not at all.
He means nothing to me.

736
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,960
No. No, in course not.
Good night.

737
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,360
Good night, Zeke.

738
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,000
Hey! You got back
here at last?

739
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,360
Yeah. There's plenty of
buffalo sign out here,

740
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,560
so I'll be riding out
to pick up fresh meat.

741
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,720
Well, who's keeping you?

742
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,760
I'll see you at the river crossing.

743
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,760
Lopez! Lopez! Thorpe!
Pull up here. Come here.

744
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,920
You two have been waiting
for your chance. Here it is.

745
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,680
Go out on a buffalo hunt.

746
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,400
Me? Nah.

747
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,320
I kill hundreds of buffalo.
Why should I go?

748
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,560
Get them cobwebs out of your brain!

749
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,840
He means, Lopez,
we might find better game.

750
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,400
Watch him till
he leaves the Pawnees,

751
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,840
and then give it
to him in the back.

752
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,840
Go on.

753
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Hey, you pilgrims!
Come here! Come here!

754
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,320
Bascom?
Yes!

755
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,840
Bascom!
Yes.

756
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,640
I'll shove the horses and
the cattle right on through.

757
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,240
Leave only the wheelers
hooked to the wagons.

758
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Once you take to the water...

759
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,000
Well, it's every man and critter
for hisself?

760
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,720
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go on!

761
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,920
Mr. Flack.

762
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,360
Mr. Flack, how can I get
my mule Useless across?

763
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,960
Well, get your
mother-in-law to ride him?

764
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,800
Mr. Bascom.
Yes?

765
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,600
Mr. Bascom, you know,
I don't like that fella.

766
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,680
No?

767
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,120
He's the kind who will pat you
on your back to your face,

768
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,800
and then laughs in your face
behind your back.

769
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,800
Yeah.

770
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,040
And another thing.
Yes?

771
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,680
If he had a mother-in-law like
mine, he would never laugh.

772
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,200
The hunt was a great success.

773
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,440
We bagged our buffalo.

774
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,240
Hey.

775
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,120
Did you get your meat?

776
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,080
Good. Good!

777
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,360
Well, we'd better
shove on off then.

778
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,440
Boots off.

779
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,320
I see you took a bath.

780
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,200
Yeah, yeah.

781
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,000
Is there... ls there
a slug of whiskey?

782
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,240
No, I left my jug... I hid
it in the Camerons' wagon.

783
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,160
By the way,
where is my little beauty?

784
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,480
Well, she's...
She's somewheres around.

785
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,840
Well, now that you've
got her all to yourself,

786
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,760
what do you aim to do with her?

787
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,880
I think I'll take her back
and settle on my plantation.

788
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,320
Your... Your plantation?

789
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,280
Lopez, he's hollered so much about
that there plantation of his,

790
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,120
he believes it hisself?

791
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,120
<i>What? The Señor Thorpe,
he have no plantation?</i>

792
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,120
Plantation! Ha!

793
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,160
All you got in the world
is a dirty deck of cards

794
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,160
and a crooked one at that.

795
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,440
Zeke.
Yeah?

796
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,240
Coleman's been gone two days.

797
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,720
Yeah. I've been kinda
worried about that myself.

798
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,680
Eagle Tail says last time he seen
him, he was headed for the train.

799
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,760
Well, another thing, the
Camerons haven't crossed yet.

800
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,840
No. I better
saunter on down there

801
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,120
and see what's holdin' 'em?

802
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
Yes. We'd better
help 'em across.

803
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,880
Yeah. Go on.

804
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
Well, I think we can...

805
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,640
We were just wondering
what had become of you.

806
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,120
Where's your horse?

807
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,480
He stepped in a prairie-dog
hole and broke his neck.

808
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,760
Come near breakin' mine too.

809
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,000
Are you hurt?

810
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,000
No. I was knocked out
for a spell.

811
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,240
Here, I'll put these in your
wagon and help you across.

812
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,840
Flack said we could
only use the wheelers.

813
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,400
Flack said? What does
he know about water?

814
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,800
He never took a bath in his life.

815
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,880
Shortie!

816
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,240
There's the Cameron wagon.

817
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,800
I'll go greet the little filly.

818
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,720
Greet?

819
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,280
Well, Lopez and me
will go greet a jug.

820
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,360
You take 'em from here on in, Dave.
It's shallow water.

821
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,120
All right, Breck. I'll go
back and get my saddle.

822
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,120
All right.

823
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,840
Giddyap!
Come on, Shortie!

824
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,240
Come on!

825
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,640
Come on, Shortie!
Come on! Get up there!

826
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,320
I was just coming over to help you.

827
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Thank you.
We had the best of help.

828
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,400
Help? Who?

829
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,200
What's the matter, Lopez?
Seein' a few ghosts?

830
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,120
Me? No, no.

831
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,480
Drive on into the corral, Dave.

832
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,600
All right.

833
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,440
Giddyap! Come on there!
Get up there!

834
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,440
Pull on up!

835
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,520
I'll be seeing you three later
about matters and things.

836
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,880
Why, hello, boy.

837
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,160
Howdy, Zeke.

838
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,400
Why, what happened?

839
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,120
Pony stepped in a dog hole.

840
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,600
Yeah? I suppose a prairie dog shot
that hole through your saddle

841
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,880
and into your horse?

842
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,880
Natchie!

843
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,040
Who was gone from camp, Zeke?

844
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,640
Thorpe and Lopez
come in during the night,

845
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,040
and early morning, sent a
wagon out for the meat.

846
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,880
Well, a nice
mess you made of things.

847
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,880
Not at all!

848
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,240
Two hundred yards running is
considerable of a handicap.

849
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,200
Besides, other days are coming.

850
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,560
Well, don't you fool yourself.

851
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,680
Here he is, here he is, here he is.

852
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,840
Flack, the Injuns been sending up

853
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,360
smoke signals for several days.

854
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Yes, well, I seen 'em.

855
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,320
I'll skirmish around with the
Pawnees for a few miles.

856
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,960
Well, go on. There ain't
no one keeping you!

857
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,000
No, but you'd better keep
Thorpe and Lopez here.

858
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,920
Why?

859
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,600
I got a feeling that if either
one of 'em leaves camp,

860
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,400
they'll never come back.

861
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,320
What do you mean by that?

862
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,080
Just the way it sounded.

863
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,320
Hey, look there.
Look there?

864
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,720
Injuns?

865
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,840
Lopez, fire a long shot at 'em.

866
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,600
No fire!

867
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,960
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.

868
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,600
They look to me
as if they're out for harm.

869
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,120
They will be if
we take a shot at 'em.

870
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,080
That'll mean war. I'll go
out and palaver with them.

871
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,000
Go on. Go on. Maybe
so you no come back?

872
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,760
Look how queerly
his horse is acting.

873
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,480
Yeah. He's riding zigzag.

874
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,600
That's Indian sign
that he wants to palaver.

875
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,600
There's the chief riding out
to meet him now for a powwow.

876
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,120
Zeke! Bascom!

877
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,440
How.

878
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,600
This is Black Elk,
an old friend of mine.

879
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,360
Do they mean peace or war?

880
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,880
Peace, if as long as we march
straight through the Cheyenne country

881
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,920
without stopping to settle.

882
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,720
Now that we're gonna be friends,

883
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,400
they'll probably bring their
families over here to beg.

884
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,160
So feed 'em well and treat 'em
right, and we'll have no trouble.

885
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,280
All right.

886
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,760
All right. Fine.

887
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,200
No more trouble now.

888
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,440
Yes. Yes. Yes.

889
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,440
Zeke, what's he saying about me?

890
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,640
He says that Coleman wants you
for his squaw.

891
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,480
Yes.

892
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,360
Yes. And he says Flack
or Thorpe will get you.

893
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,280
Flack or Thorpe? Why?
Yeah.

894
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,640
Well, Flack's got a lot of horses.

895
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,040
Miss Ruth,
you shouldn't be riding out

896
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,960
here alone like this
away from the train.

897
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,520
Why not?

898
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,920
Because this is dangerous country
and anything might happen.

899
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,040
You wouldn't care.

900
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,800
Care? Me?

901
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,720
Why should you care?

902
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,280
Listen, girl,
if anything happened to you,

903
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,280
it'd be like throwing
my heart to the wol...

904
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,800
What...

905
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,840
Don't worry. It's Black Elk
and some of his braves.

906
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,680
Coleman squaw.
Coleman squaw.

907
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,200
Well, he's saying
that I'm your squaw.

908
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,120
Seems like that's
what he's driving at.

909
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,600
Well, you tell him that you
don't want me for your squaw.

910
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,920
I've never told
Black Elk a lie yet.

911
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,880
He knows my tongue is straight.

912
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,800
Well, what do you mean?

913
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,800
Well, it wouldn't be true if I
told him I didn't want you.

914
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
It happens I do.

915
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,480
And you've no better taste than

916
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,040
to tell me that
before all these savages?

917
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,000
I'd tell you that
in front of the whole world.

918
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,800
This silly joke
has gone far enough.

919
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,920
Hey! Well,
there's one down anyway.

920
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,640
Well, there's some more out there.
Let's go get 'em.

921
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,600
All right, here we go.

922
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,600
Here she goes!

923
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,240
That's it.
That's it.

924
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,800
Another one.

925
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,240
Get over there. Hey.

926
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,960
Hey, there. Go on.

927
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,600
Yeah. Hope we land
in no trouble up ahead.

928
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,200
Help those...
Help them take this stuff,

929
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,360
the ones that are going down.

930
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,480
All right.
Hold tight.

931
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,440
All right.

932
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
You should be fine.

933
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,200
Hang on, boy.

934
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,680
You take Honey Girl
from here on down, Dave.

935
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,920
It's a little easier going.

936
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,880
Hold on.
All right, Breck.

937
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,920
Careful of her, Davey.

938
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,080
Now, Miss Ruth, you cling on to me.

939
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,440
Put your arms around
my neck, Honey Girl.

940
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,200
A little tighter.

941
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,520
Just a little tighter.

942
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,800
Let him down.
Come on, men.

943
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,440
Hurry up.

944
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,600
Hang on.
Let's take some in pairs.

945
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,640
Are you all right, Honey Girl?

946
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,080
It was a pretty bad place,
wasn't it, Breck?

947
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,360
Yeah, but I sort of liked it.

948
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,560
Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.
Come on, Honey Girl.

949
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,560
Thank you, Breck.

950
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,160
Well, well, well, well!

951
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,040
So I've seen that gal with her arms

952
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,840
around your neck at last.

953
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,160
Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them
when she got on safe footin'.

954
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,080
Yeah.

955
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,680
You know, she don't care
nothin' about me, Zeke.

956
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, you can never tell how a
woman feels by the way she acts.

957
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,880
They's all riddles, all of 'em,
and you just gotta guess 'em.

958
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,720
And no matter which way
you guess, you're wrong.

959
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,120
Looks like as if the way
they're puttin'

960
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,680
some of them outfits over there,

961
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,680
they're a-gonna lose 'em.

962
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,800
Hold it!

963
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,000
Ha-ha! What did I tell you?

964
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,600
Let's get out of here afore
they get a bead on us.

965
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,240
Hold it!

966
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,040
Zeke, did you hear
that terrible crash?

967
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,960
Hear it? I seen it.

968
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,040
You did?
That was your wagon!

969
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,760
Was my
mother-in-law in it?

970
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,960
No, she wasn't.

971
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,280
That's too bad.

972
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,520
What'd you say?

973
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,720
I said, "I am glad."

974
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,120
Lucky for you that I wasn't,
you loafing hound.

975
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,440
What you mean?

976
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,440
Because I was with your wife,
Sarah, and she gave birth to twins.

977
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,680
Twins? Are they both mine?

978
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,680
Both.

979
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,440
Mama, are they boys or girls?

980
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
One of each!

981
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,600
Zeke, I am a papa.
Mama, I am a papa.

982
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,520
Papa, lam a mama.
Yeah.

983
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,040
I got two for one.

984
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,840
Yeah. Let's drink
to the happy event.

985
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,440
Wait a minute. There was two events.
I have two drinks.

986
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,640
Here, give me that jug. I'll
take a pull at that myself.

987
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,800
Three more.

988
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,160
Hyah! Giddyap!

989
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,200
Well, who'd have guessed it?

990
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,680
If it ain't Breck Coleman.

991
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,760
Howdy, Jim.

992
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,320
Where'd you blow in from, boy?

993
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,840
All the way from the big river.

994
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,840
Flack.

995
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,760
How long are we gonna camp here?

996
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,480
Well, just as long as it
takes to fix up the outfit.

997
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,600
Bascom, you tell them
pilgrims of yours,

998
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,200
there's 500 miles
of desert ahead of us

999
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,760
and them that don't like
what's comin' to them,

1000
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,160
now's the time for
'em to turn back.

1001
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,040
Yes, sir, that pork
is nearly done right now.

1002
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,960
Shank me off a snack!

1003
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,960
Get out of there.

1004
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,680
Fine piece of beef.

1005
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,880
Fetch it on over here.

1006
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,560
I hate to see you at menial tasks.

1007
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,960
If we were only back at my
old plantation in Louisiana,

1008
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,720
you'd have a dozen servants
to wait on you.

1009
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
Let's turn back.

1010
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,720
Turn back, Mr. Thorpe?
Why... Why, I...

1011
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,280
Honey Girl, didn't I tell
you to stay away from the fire?

1012
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,440
Yes. And you told me not to
be sitting in a rocking chair

1013
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,600
when Breck Coleman was around.

1014
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Hello, Coleman.

1015
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,160
Howdy, Dave.

1016
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,600
You shot these turkeys. Won't
you stay and help us eat them?

1017
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,520
No. I just had supper
with the Bascoms.

1018
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,440
Sorry, Breck.

1019
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,920
Think I'll go hunt up old Zeke.

1020
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,600
How many's that for you, Windy?

1021
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,920
Number 84.

1022
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,840
Well, here comes 85.

1023
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,480
Hello, Zeke. Windy.

1024
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,040
Hello, boy.

1025
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,280
I smell turkey a-cookin'.

1026
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,520
That's all I got was a smell.

1027
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,240
Deal me a hand of them flapjacks.

1028
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,240
That's the way it's done, Gussie.

1029
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,400
My old arm's giving out. Now you try it.
I'll get a pail of water.

1030
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,360
That's easy.
I can do that.

1031
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,680
See, I've saw Zeke do that
till he broke his arm.

1032
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,160
Yes. And you know, someday my
mother-in-law's gonna talk so much,

1033
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,840
she's going to break
her "yaw."

1034
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,240
Say, boy, I wouldn't let my
mother-in-law boss me around like that.

1035
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,440
Stand up to her like a man.
Face her down, boy.

1036
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,200
If it was me, I'd tell
her what was on my chest.

1037
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,760
You got nothing
on your chest but wind!

1038
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,760
You old polecat.

1039
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,000
I've just been
talking with some trappers

1040
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,000
who've come out of the Southwest.

1041
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,240
They say the country they
call California is wonderful.

1042
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,240
Yes, so I've heard.

1043
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,040
Why won't you come with me
to a land like that?

1044
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,960
Are you going there?

1045
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,840
If you'll come with me.

1046
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,240
Well, what about
your plantation in Louisiana?

1047
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,560
Well...

1048
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,000
If we like California better,

1049
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,560
we could sell my holdings and
buy vast lands out there.

1050
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,800
Well, it's...
It's a compliment

1051
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,760
to offer me all that,
but it can't be.

1052
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,000
I must join Davey.

1053
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,520
Dave.
Dave, come over here.

1054
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,560
Black Elk here says that you and
your sister were so good to him,

1055
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,160
when he come in to visit that he
wants to give you all them ponies.

1056
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,320
Well, that's kind of him, Zeke,

1057
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,080
but we couldn't take their horses.

1058
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,160
Of course you could.
They got hundreds of ponies.

1059
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,960
He wants you to show him
where to put 'em.

1060
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,080
You go and throw them ponies
in with your herd.

1061
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,280
Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot.

1062
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,280
That Injun's buying Cameron's
sister for Coleman's squaw.

1063
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,400
Well... Well...
Well, why not?

1064
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,480
So Coleman's
buying himself a squaw?

1065
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,200
Zeke, you old whiskered Cupid, you!

1066
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,480
I loathe the very sight of you!

1067
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,720
What have I done now?

1068
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,520
You've made me
the joke of the plains.

1069
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,600
Me?

1070
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,080
Who else tried to buy me
like an Indian squaw?

1071
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,200
You put me to shame
before them all.

1072
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,320
Why, girl, you're imagining things.

1073
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,240
Zeke always told me
women were damned funny.

1074
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,960
Mr. Thorpe,
I've changed my mind.

1075
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,760
I'll go with you to California
if you'll go at once.

1076
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,480
At once?
Why, yes, yes.

1077
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,960
I'll make preparations immediately.

1078
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,440
This is a fine state of affairs.

1079
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,080
This man Thorpe isn't
all he claims to be.

1080
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:16,520
My mind is made up, Davey, and
we're going to California.

1081
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,120
Where's Flack?

1082
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,000
Hey!

1083
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,560
I just came in to
tell you good-bye.

1084
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:39,280
Good-bye?
Where are you going?

1085
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,840
I'm going to take my outfit
and leave you here.

1086
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,840
Your outfit? All you got
is one horse and two guns.

1087
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,800
No, the Cameron outfit's mine now.

1088
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,560
It is?

1089
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,360
Yes, we're going to California,

1090
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,800
so I'll bid you a fond farewell.

1091
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,880
No, you ain't!

1092
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,040
No?
Nah!

1093
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,240
Why do you suppose
I grubstaked you for?

1094
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,080
So far, you've been a fizzle.

1095
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,560
One try, one miss.

1096
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,040
He's no longer in my way.

1097
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,480
Well, he's in mine.

1098
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,240
Well, tear him down yourself.

1099
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,680
I'd like to kick him into pulp.

1100
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,480
I'd like to
break him in two like a...

1101
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,920
Well, why not?

1102
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,840
I don't mind fists or feet,
or even a gun.

1103
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,520
It's the way he throws that knife.

1104
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,920
But why should I risk it?

1105
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,680
Because you're a dead shot.

1106
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,240
You're a-going to stick.

1107
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,480
You're a-going to prove
how good you are,

1108
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,720
before you leave the fort.

1109
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,960
And if I don't?

1110
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,960
Well, if you don't...

1111
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,640
I'll tell that little filly

1112
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,120
there's a wide-open noose
waitin' for you

1113
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,640
in every river town.

1114
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:05,440
Thorpe, you do your
job before you leave the fort.

1115
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,440
Howdy, Henry.

1116
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,160
How's things, Coleman?
Just fine.

1117
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,880
Say, Black Elk was telling me

1118
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,040
that all the Injuns in the West

1119
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,920
was gathering to keep you
all from passin' through.

1120
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,360
So they tell me.

1121
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,720
Black Elk and the Cheyennes
are going west

1122
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,320
to hold a powwow
with the Shoshones.

1123
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,480
Yeah, Black Elk tells me
that it's almost certain

1124
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,960
that the Cheyennes
will declare war later.

1125
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,040
Likely.

1126
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,560
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking
about you a while ago.

1127
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,000
Pete? Where is he?

1128
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,720
Camped at the spring yonder
with his new squaw.

1129
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,320
I think I'll ramble
down and see him.

1130
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,520
Sure.

1131
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,040
Say, Henry, will you put a
new cap nipple on this gun?

1132
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,000
Sure will, boy.

1133
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,520
And a new trigger
spring in the pistol.

1134
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
All right.

1135
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,360
I'll leave 'em with you
while I go see Pete.

1136
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,560
Be ready when you come back.

1137
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,760
We are about to unite
this loving and devoted couple

1138
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,600
in the holy bonds of wedlock.

1139
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,480
Hank Ginnis, do you take this woman

1140
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,160
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1141
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,560
I do.

1142
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,680
Abigail Vance, do you take this man

1143
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,160
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1144
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,280
She does!

1145
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,800
Hey, Flack.

1146
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,840
Yeah?

1147
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,800
You recollect how Coleman done
told you that if Lopez here,

1148
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,880
or Thorpe done strayed off
into the brush,

1149
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,480
they weren't likely as how
never come back?

1150
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,560
Sure!

1151
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,560
He made some kind of a bluff.
What of it?

1152
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,560
Well, Thorpe strayed out

1153
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,040
and he ain't
a-never comin' back.

1154
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,080
Hey?

1155
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,440
No.

1156
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,840
He's done gone back
to his old plantation.

1157
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,760
Yeah.

1158
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,480
Well, you won't go to
California with Thorpe now.

1159
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,680
Why not?

1160
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,680
He and Coleman
just met in the brush,

1161
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,240
and Coleman shot him.

1162
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,440
Are you sure?

1163
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,160
I heard the shot.

1164
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,320
And I saw Coleman
standing there over him.

1165
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,320
It suits me too.

1166
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,000
So he'll even do murder.

1167
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:00,480
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

1168
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,040
And may peace
and happiness be yours.

1169
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,560
There's been a murder!
There's been a murder!

1170
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:14,040
A murder? Where?
Where, girl? Who?

1171
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,720
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe
in the brush and shot him!

1172
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,840
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure?

1173
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,960
My brother saw it.

1174
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,480
Men, we can't have cold-blooded
murderers among us.

1175
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,720
There's the man
that shot Bill Thorpe

1176
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,880
down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.

1177
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,920
Get a rope.

1178
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,960
Yeah, get the rope!

1179
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,040
And just who accuses me
of killing Thorpe?

1180
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,640
It...
It was Miss Cameron.

1181
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,760
You?

1182
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,280
So you'd like to see me hang.

1183
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,640
Listen to me, you.

1184
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,000
This boy, Coleman, here just
couldn't have killed Thorpe.

1185
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,120
Why not?

1186
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,880
'Cause he didn't
have no guns on him.

1187
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,640
He left his'n with
Dutch Henry to be fixed.

1188
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,920
Coleman and Thorpe were at
odds with the Cameron girl.

1189
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,240
If it wasn't Coleman,
who was it who shot Thorpe?

1190
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,280
Since you're aimin' to know,
I'll tell you who done it.

1191
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:11,000
Who?
I shot that skunk myself!

1192
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,960
Coleman's a friend of his, men.

1193
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,960
He's lying to save his neck.

1194
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,240
What could Zeke have
against a man like Thorpe?

1195
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,280
You want to know that too?

1196
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,480
Yes, I want to know that too!

1197
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,640
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.

1198
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,320
I was camped out
pretty close to you,

1199
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,720
and I heared that powwow
you had with Thorpe.

1200
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,000
Yeah? What are
you driving at?

1201
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,280
Just this.

1202
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,840
When a man begins to do a lot
of talkin' about hangin',

1203
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,880
he'd better make
pretty sure as to who's

1204
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,880
gonna decorate the end of the rope.

1205
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,920
Get my meaning?

1206
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,720
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.
It's no affair of mine.

1207
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,360
That's just what
I was a-thinkin'.

1208
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,600
And Coleman ain't gonna
do no scouting,

1209
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,200
while I'm boss of this train.

1210
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,360
I'm leaving him behind.

1211
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,600
Coleman would never...

1212
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:00,280
Now, we're taking on a new scout.

1213
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,560
Guess again, Flack.

1214
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,080
I started with this outfit, and
I'll be with it at the finish.

1215
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,080
Who says so?

1216
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,360
I'm just telling ya.

1217
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,320
I got two reasons.

1218
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,400
One is I told Wellmore
I'd scout the train through.

1219
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,160
The other is a little personal
business I aim to transact

1220
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,120
at the end of the trail.

1221
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,080
See if you can figure out
what that is, Flack.

1222
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,320
Coleman, the settlers
are willing to push on.

1223
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,640
We'll follow you.
What's this talk about Injuns?

1224
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,600
It's true.
The Injuns are gathering

1225
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,480
to the westward to stop us
from going through.

1226
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,920
Injuns have never yet
prevented our breed of men

1227
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,880
from travelin'
into the settin' sun.

1228
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,640
Go on. Lead the way.

1229
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,000
Well, get your outfits together.
We're going.

1230
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,320
Never mind what you see
or what you hear.

1231
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,120
Red Flack is still
boss of the train.

1232
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,400
Get her going!

1233
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,040
Go on.
Let's pull out and follow!

1234
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,000
Giddyap!

1235
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,280
Hup!

1236
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,200
Ho!

1237
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,000
Fall in!

1238
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,120
Nag, giddyap!

1239
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,280
Get in!

1240
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,880
It's no use, men.

1241
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,640
She's all dried up.

1242
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,840
Hey, them settlers
is dyin' off like rats.

1243
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,520
We're for moving on.
Come on, Lopez.

1244
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,760
Boy, they're scattered
back all across the desert.

1245
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,120
We gotta gather 'em up
and shove 'em along.

1246
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,160
Old Charlie died, Coleman.

1247
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,840
We raised him from a colt.

1248
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,000
Tough, boy.

1249
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,320
But we gotta battle it through.

1250
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,480
Hyah!

1251
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,960
Giddyap!

1252
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,600
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap, Toby! Giddyap!

1253
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,760
Giddyap there!
Giddyap, Toby!

1254
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,400
Come on!

1255
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,240
Come on!

1256
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,320
Work 'em on through!

1257
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,040
What's all this?

1258
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,760
Injun signs!

1259
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,000
Pull up! Pull up!

1260
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,760
Pull up!

1261
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,280
Pull up there!

1262
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,520
Pull over!

1263
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,920
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

1264
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,080
Here's your gun, boy!

1265
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,680
All right.

1266
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,240
Get up there.

1267
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,720
Come on! Come on!
Get in here! Hurry up!

1268
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,000
Don't panic!

1269
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,640
Looks like
Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke.

1270
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,840
Yeah.

1271
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,640
Now let's throw it into 'em!

1272
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:22,080
Stop shootin', everybody!

1273
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:25,000
Stop shootin'!
They're ridin' off.

1274
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,880
When they wheel back on us,
reload it up and give it to 'em!

1275
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,240
Yes, sir!

1276
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,160
There they go, boy.
There they go.

1277
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:55,200
Ha! I guess we was just
a little too much for 'em.

1278
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,040
Father, our good
friends have perished here

1279
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,400
at the hands of the savages.

1280
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:33,480
Open your arms to them
and care for our loved ones

1281
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,920
until we meet again
on the other shore.

1282
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,840
Amen.

1283
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,760
Well, Zeke...

1284
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,520
Ol' Windy's gone on another trail.

1285
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,000
Windy, you and me was...

1286
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,960
Well, you and me was...

1287
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,640
My baby!

1288
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:07,840
My baby! No!

1289
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,840
My baby!

1290
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:16,160
Well, Zeke, I'm gonna
trail the Injuns

1291
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,560
and make sure they go
back to their villages.

1292
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:19,720
So you scout the train ahead,

1293
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,600
and I'll pick it up
in a week or so.

1294
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,600
Bye, Zeke.

1295
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,600
Bye, boy.

1296
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,040
Giddyap, there!

1297
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,320
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap!

1298
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,600
Get over there!
Giddyap, there!

1299
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,600
Come on, boys.

1300
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,000
Get a hold of that wheel!

1301
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,320
Tough time!

1302
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,600
Lopez! Lopez,
get 'em in line!

1303
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:30,720
<i>Hey, sí!</i>

1304
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,000
Put the whip to them!

1305
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:39,920
Hey!

1306
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,120
Pull the trailers!

1307
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,400
Giddyap there!

1308
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,800
Get on Up!

1309
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,040
Work 'em over!

1310
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,560
Go on!

1311
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,840
Get outta there!

1312
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,000
Come on, Bob!

1313
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,600
Get 'em movin' to the right!

1314
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,560
Get over there!

1315
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,080
Hey! Get over there!
Giddyap, boy!

1316
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,040
Come on. Come on.
Giddyap. Giddyap.

1317
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,840
There we go!

1318
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,160
I wonder how long
we'll be bogged down here.

1319
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:16,000
I don't know. I heard there
was three wagons already turned back.

1320
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,560
Ma, let's turn back to Missouri!

1321
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:22,160
Me? Turn back because
of a little mud?

1322
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,600
Say, Uncle, when did
Bascom women ever turn back?

1323
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,240
Grandma, don't you and Ma
know that Pa is only jokin'?

1324
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:32,600
Ha! All right now.
Be powerful on it now.

1325
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,360
Hyah! Hyah!

1326
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,800
Go on there, Fanny!
Go on, Meg!

1327
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,000
Go on there, Jennie!
Jennie, go on! Go on, go on!

1328
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,000
We're stuck.

1329
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,960
Gus, you idiot!
You see what you've done?

1330
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,560
You've got my wagon
up to the hub in mud!

1331
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,040
What are you kickin' about?
I am sitting on my mule.

1332
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:57,160
But don't worry, Mama.

1333
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,480
I think it's gonna clear up.
There will be no more rain.

1334
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,720
Get up! Get up!
Throw that idiot...

1335
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,640
Throw that idiot a rope
and help him out of there.

1336
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,920
Keep in line!

1337
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,600
Get up here!

1338
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:24,080
Take the settlers to the right!

1339
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,240
Get over here!

1340
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,840
Get up in there!

1341
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,200
Come over here and hold on.

1342
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:43,320
Giddyap there!

1343
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,680
Keep it in line!

1344
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,480
Get over there!
Get over there!

1345
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,360
Come on, boy!

1346
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,280
Giddyap there!

1347
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,880
Keep it going!

1348
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,880
Come on there!

1349
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:15,040
Keep it going!

1350
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,360
Here, Abbie.
Here's the water.

1351
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,960
Mama, I got good news for you.

1352
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,840
You're always bad news to me.

1353
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,320
Get on your long underwear quick.

1354
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,080
Why?

1355
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:58,520
Well, you're going in the snow
up to your... Up to your... Your...

1356
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:02,160
Way up, Mama. And hand
me out my bear overcoat.

1357
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,600
Well, Useless...

1358
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:08,240
You're going someplace
you won't want to sit down.

1359
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:11,280
It's so cold,
it'll freeze your hooves off.

1360
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,880
You wait and see.

1361
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,640
Think I'll go say howdy
to the Camerons.

1362
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,720
This is my best overcoat.

1363
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,960
Well, I'd hate to
see your worst one.

1364
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:25,320
Hello, Gus.

1365
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,400
Hello there, Breck.

1366
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,320
I'm certainly glad
to see you back again.

1367
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,320
What are you wearing
the heavy overcoat for?

1368
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,960
I'm getting all
ready for that snow.

1369
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:33,680
No, we won't be there for days.

1370
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,520
Well, anyway, I'm going
to keep warm by the camp.

1371
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,360
Where's the Cameron outfit?

1372
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,120
We left them
four or five days back.

1373
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,920
Left 'em?

1374
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,680
Yes. All their horses give
out. They couldn't go on.

1375
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,880
Fifteen, 20 wagons. They
all went back to the fort.

1376
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,800
I hated to tell ya, son.

1377
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,720
Zeke, why did you
let the Camerons go?

1378
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,680
Not my doin', son.

1379
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,080
Flack knows I savvy Injun sign,

1380
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,680
so he sends me on ahead to scout.

1381
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,000
And when I come back,
they'd all dropped out.

1382
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,640
If Injuns chance on those wagons,
they'll kill the lot of 'em.

1383
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,840
I'm afeard so, Breck boy.

1384
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:05,560
The Way's clear ahead, Zeke.
You scout 'em.

1385
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:06,680
Yeah.

1386
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:07,840
I'm going back for the Camerons.

1387
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,920
Good luck, son!

1388
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Giddyap, Jennie!

1389
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,040
Well, Useless...

1390
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,400
Giddyap, Jennie!

1391
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,720
I don't know who smells
the worse, you or me.

1392
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,720
Go ahead there!

1393
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,880
Come on. Here we go again.

1394
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,880
Pull, Fanny!

1395
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,440
Hello! Hello!

1396
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,520
I felt someway that you'd come.

1397
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,720
I'd have been here
a heap sooner if I could've.

1398
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,360
Say, Dave, you'd
better out off that trailer

1399
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,640
and throw everything
into one wagon.

1400
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:05,680
All right.

1401
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,040
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody

1402
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:09,520
and we'll see if we can
get out of here.

1403
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,640
After you left,

1404
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,360
old Zeke told me the truth
about some matters.

1405
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,360
Thorpe and Flack and all.

1406
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,600
He did?

1407
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:21,680
Sorry I was so stupid.

1408
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:26,080
Don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.

1409
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,200
I should have known better.

1410
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:31,920
Well, we all get off on the
wrong trail once in a while.

1411
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,600
We'll make it through all right.

1412
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:39,200
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?

1413
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,440
No, I guess not.

1414
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,680
We oughta overtake those
settlers in a week or so.

1415
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,400
Here you are, Ruthie.
Take it.

1416
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:58,080
We're goin' again, Davey.

1417
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,400
Heave-ho.

1418
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:06,280
Pull 'er there. Come on.
Come on there, Shortie.

1419
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,600
What did I tell you?
You wouldn't listen to me.

1420
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:35,520
You wouldn't listen to me!
We're lost!

1421
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,160
There ain't a man here that
knows the pass over them hills!

1422
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,560
We're for turning back!

1423
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,960
Wait! Wait!

1424
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,520
Follow me and I'll lead you to that
valley that Coleman told us about.

1425
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,160
Coleman? He's the
only one that knows the way out,

1426
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,600
and he's deserted us!

1427
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,680
Sure, he quit!

1428
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,960
If he was here, I'd shoot
him down in his tracks.

1429
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,800
Well, Flack, just when
you gonna start this shootin'?

1430
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,480
You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?

1431
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,520
They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?

1432
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,280
They're all against me.
They're turning back.

1433
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,520
No, you're not!

1434
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,720
We can't turn back.

1435
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,280
We're blazing a trail
that started in England.

1436
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,800
Not even storms of the sea could

1437
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,920
turn back those first settlers.

1438
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,080
And they carried it on further.

1439
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,880
They blazed it on through
the wilderness of Kentucky.

1440
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,760
Famine, hunger, not even
massacres could stop them.

1441
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,000
And now we've picked up
the trail again,

1442
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:35,600
and nothing can stop us!

1443
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:39,200
Not even the snows of winter nor the
peaks of the highest mountains.

1444
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,800
We're building a nation!
So we've got to suffer.

1445
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,200
No great trail was ever
blazed without hardship.

1446
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,400
And you've gotta fight!
That's life.

1447
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,120
And when you stop fightin',
that's death.

1448
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,200
What are you gonna do,
lie down and die?

1449
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,560
No!

1450
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:57,720
No!

1451
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:00,280
Not in a thousand years.
You're going on with me!

1452
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:03,200
The word is said,
and we'll follow you.

1453
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,480
Be ready to start at sunup!

1454
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,840
Well... Well,
he's turned up again.

1455
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,720
Yeah, well, he'll down
the both of us.

1456
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,080
You've got to get him tonight.

1457
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,040
But they can hear a shot at night.

1458
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,720
Well, they can't hear a knife.

1459
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,120
They all know this knife of mine.

1460
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:33,800
Well, here's a knife
they don't know.

1461
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,360
No, no, no, no.
I afraid of that knife.

1462
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,000
I know where you got it.

1463
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,160
It will get us in trouble sure.

1464
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,280
How?

1465
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,080
Because a dead man's
knife is bad medicine!

1466
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,560
Here, just stop that drivel.
No.

1467
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:53,400
Take the knife and
wait for tonight.

1468
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:59,320
There he goes.

1469
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:07,080
Wait until he's bedded down,
and then...

1470
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,720
Give me a drink.

1471
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:21,400
God bless my sister Ruth
and my brother Dave,

1472
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,360
and make me a good girl,
and take care of us.

1473
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:29,120
Aren't you going to ask God to
take care of Breck Coleman?

1474
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:32,960
Zeke says that Breck Coleman
can take care of himself.

1475
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,120
You overplayed
your hand that time, Lopez!

1476
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:11,680
Zeke, this is
old Ben Griswell's knife.

1477
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:14,840
Well, where'd you find it, boy?

1478
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,840
Lopez just left it
sticking in my bedroll.

1479
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,800
Their having it makes it certain
that Flack and Lopez did it.

1480
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,560
No question about it, boy.

1481
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,800
What did they do, Coleman?

1482
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,080
Killed my best friend.

1483
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,960
I been on their trail ever since.

1484
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,760
That's a serious charge.

1485
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,400
If you're sure, we'll call a settlers'
meeting in the morning to try 'em.

1486
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,560
You can call a settlers'
meeting to bury 'em.

1487
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,600
What do you mean?

1488
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,960
That I kill my own rats!

1489
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,200
They've jumped camp,
Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.

1490
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,200
Breck, you can't leave us here!

1491
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,040
You got to see us through.

1492
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,920
He's right, boy.

1493
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,720
Maybe so, the way
you all look at it.

1494
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,480
But those two men
killed a man in cold blood,

1495
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,400
and they've got to pay.

1496
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:12,000
It's not that I've got
hatred in my heart,

1497
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,240
but that I'm the law
out here, that's all.

1498
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,560
And the law is justice.

1499
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:23,040
Well, Zeke, I'll see 'em
to the end of the trail.

1500
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,400
But then I'm picking up
a new trail here.

1501
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,640
Get over! Get over!

1502
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:48,760
Get over here!

1503
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:49,800
Hah! Get over! Hah!

1504
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:50,880
Get over!

1505
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:51,960
Hah! Hah!

1506
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,280
Hah!

1507
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,920
Get over! Pull!

1508
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:04,840
Yonder stands
the great white mountain.

1509
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,640
And down below lies the
valley I've told you about.

1510
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:11,280
Coleman, you have
fulfilled our hopes.

1511
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:15,600
Neighbors!
Friends!

1512
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:18,960
It is fitting that we give
thanks to the Almighty.

1513
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:26,840
Our Father, we thank thee for
leading us to this land of promise,

1514
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,760
for guiding our footsteps safely

1515
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,120
through the dangers
of our pilgrimage.

1516
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,600
In this valley of
our dreams, we'll build

1517
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,800
our homes and serve thee, O Father.

1518
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,800
And our children's children
shall praise thy name.

1519
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,800
Amen.

1520
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,480
The way is clear ahead.
All gentle slopes.

1521
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:52,120
So drive down, my friends,
and settle it.

1522
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,000
Lead the way.

1523
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,040
Zeke will lead the way down.

1524
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:57,920
Our trails fork here.

1525
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,600
You mean you are leaving us?

1526
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:04,640
There's a trail I've followed
for over 3,000 miles now,

1527
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:08,320
and I'm headin' back to pick it up
again and follow it to the end.

1528
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,040
Coleman, you're the breed of man

1529
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:13,720
that would follow
a trail to the end.

1530
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,680
Thanks, Bascom.

1531
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,840
Friends, we'll go on.

1532
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,880
Boy, there's two of 'em.
Bad ones.

1533
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:24,480
Now, I'm going with you.

1534
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:26,800
No, Zeke.

1535
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,960
You stay here and look after
Ruth and her outfit.

1536
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,480
Breck, you're not leaving.

1537
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,720
Yes, Miss Ruth.
I'm pullin' out.

1538
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,840
They say you're going to
hunt down Flack and Lopez.

1539
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,160
That's what I aim to do.

1540
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,040
But you can't do
this awful thing...

1541
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,680
Take two lives!

1542
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,320
It's frontier justice.

1543
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,040
Don't go, Breck.
Don't go!

1544
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:57,920
It's a job I've got to finish.

1545
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,280
But don't you see?

1546
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:04,000
It doesn't matter about them.
I'm afraid for you.

1547
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,000
They'll kill you!

1548
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:12,440
You're everything
in the world to me, Breck.

1549
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:15,760
I can't let you go!
I can't!

1550
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,000
The thing has to be done.

1551
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,960
Someday...

1552
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,920
Somewhere...

1553
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,560
Our trails will cross again.

1554
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,600
Now, now.
Come, come, miss.

1555
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:41,600
You mustn't be
a-carryin' on thataway.

1556
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:44,960
He's gone.
He'll never come back.

1557
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,560
Now, now, you just mustn't
do this, miss.

1558
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:51,520
You'll have me a-blubberin'
here pretty soon.

1559
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,960
I'm a-tellin' ya that everything
is going to be all right.

1560
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,280
When spring comes in that valley,

1561
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,440
he'll be tracking back again.

1562
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,200
I know that boy.
I know him.

1563
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:07,040
Now, come, come.
Come on, Ruth.

1564
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,360
Come on.

1565
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,960
My legs are froze to the knees.

1566
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:36,960
I can't get up.

1567
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,360
Yes, looks as if
you're done for, Lopez.

1568
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:42,720
But, Flack, don't go away
and leave me, Flack.

1569
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,080
What? Do you think
I'm staying here?

1570
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:47,840
Well, then leave me a blanket!
I'm frozen.

1571
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,560
Won't do you no good.

1572
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:52,120
You'll be froze to
death in an hour.

1573
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:53,200
Flack!

1574
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,240
It may help me.
Now get away.

1575
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,440
Flack! Flack!

1576
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:00,240
Flack, don't let me die alone!

1577
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,240
Stay with me! Flack!

1578
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,200
Flack!

1579
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:36,600
Well, Lopez.

1580
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,360
It won't be long
before you have company.

1581
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,200
Flack!

1582
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:07,520
Yeah, Milt.

1583
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,800
I got a hankerin' to trail
on down into Mexico.

1584
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,320
Old Bill Gillie done told me

1585
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,280
that them there black-eyed
gals is just full of fire.

1586
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,440
Zeke?
Yeah?

1587
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,000
Zeke, you're not really leaving us?

1588
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:23,280
Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out. You
is all nice and settled now.

1589
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,560
And this here valley is gettin'

1590
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:27,080
altogether too civilized for me.

1591
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,800
Whenever I get more
than three or four families

1592
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,080
within a hundred mile of me,

1593
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,680
I begin to feel kind of crowded.

1594
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,240
That's not why you're going, Zeke.

1595
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,520
No? Why else, gal?

1596
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:42,840
Breck has never come back. You're
going out to look for him.

1597
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:45,120
Now, wherever that boy
Breck Coleman is at,

1598
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,280
he's a-lookin'
out for hisself.

1599
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,440
Now don't you fret about him.

1600
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,200
Did you give
away all your little puppies?

1601
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,000
Why are you looking at that dress?

1602
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,520
This is the anniversary of the...

1603
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,960
The day that the wagon
train left from Missouri.

1604
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,040
Last time I had this on,

1605
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:22,600
I was sitting in
the Riggses' cabin.

1606
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,800
In a rocking chair?

1607
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,800
Yes, Honey Girl.

1608
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,200
In a rocking chair.

1609
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,440
Zeke, I reckon that's a panther.

1610
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:44,160
Yeah!
It's a two-legged panther.

1611
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:47,840
The only kind whatever gimme
that Comanche yell as a signal.

1612
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,360
We might just as well
start to unpack.

1613
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,920
What, ain't you going?

1614
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,400
No use of going now.

1615
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:57,800
He's only a bit up in the timber
there, and he's a-headed this way.

1616
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:00,160
Zeke, won't you stay over
for the anniversary?

1617
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:01,240
Yes, gal, I'll stay.

1618
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,280
Aw!

1619
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,040
And I just recollected, I got
a little present for you.

1620
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,320
Zeke, what is it?

1621
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,560
Well, a young fella named Breck
Coleman left it with me,

1622
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:13,680
and he told me to give it to
you in case he didn't show up.

1623
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,720
Where is it, Zeke?

1624
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,560
I hid it in the holler of the big
tree at the bend of the trail.

1625
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,800
You'll find it there.

1626
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,960
Thanks, Zeke.
I'll go get it.

1627
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:42,600
