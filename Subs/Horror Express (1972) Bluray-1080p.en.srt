00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:35,749
<i>(Saxton) The following report</i>
<i>to the Royal Geological Society</i>

5
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:41,658
<i>by the undersigned, Alexander Saxton,</i>
<i>is a true and faithful account</i>

6
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:47,326
<i>of events that befell</i>
<i>the Society's expedition in Manchuria.</i>

7
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,077
<i>As the leader of the expedition,</i>

8
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:55,494
<i>I must accept responsibility</i>
<i>for its ending in disaster.</i>

9
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,405
<i>But I will leave to the judgment</i>
<i>of the honourable members</i>

10
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:05,123
<i>the decision as to where the blame</i>
<i>for the catastrophe lies.</i>

(Man whistling)

12
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,366
(Wind whistling)

13
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:43,036
(Train whistle)

14
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:26,782
- I'm sorry, there isn't a seat left.
- My name is Saxton, Alexander Saxton.

15
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:30,779
If you will check, you will find the telegram
I sent you three weeks ago

16
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,907
instructing you to reserve accommodation.

17
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,158
- (Phone ringing)
- There's nothing I can do.

18
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,328
Hello? Yes.

19
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,657
Well, well, look who's here.
Professor Saxton, I presume?

20
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,659
- Doctor Wells.
- And what are you doing in Shanghai?

21
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,405
- I might ask you the same thing.
- I'm just collecting a few specimens.

22
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,658
Miss Jones, let me introduce
Professor Alexander Saxton.

23
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,659
He dabbles in fossils and bones.

24
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,782
Glad to meet you, Professor.

25
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,578
Miss Jones has been assisting me.
Bacteriology, excellent technician.

26
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,746
(Chuckles) For a woman, he means.

27
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:25,741
(Speaks Chinese)

28
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,450
Excuse me.

29
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,159
Two private compartments to Moscow,
if you please.

30
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:59,866
- Two, you say? Will that be all?
- And three crates of animals.

31
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,448
- Impossible.
- I know I'm asking you to perform miracles.

32
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,823
But perhaps this will help.

33
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,907
Thank you.

34
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:38,324
It's called "squeeze" in China.
The Americans call it know-how.

35
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,954
And in Britain, we call it bribery and corruption.

36
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,448
Now, sir, excuse me.

37
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,410
You! Get out!

38
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,243
Halt! Sir Alexander Saxton?

39
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,331
- Yes.
- Captain 0'Hagan, sir.

40
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,539
General Wang told me to find you
and to make myself useful.

41
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,873
Um... um... now I remember!
I do have Your Excellency's ticket.

42
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:21,497
- Your... your ticket, right here.
- Thank you.

43
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,616
(Chanting)

44
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,827
And the Lord have mercy on his soul.

45
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:40,995
Not that he deserves it, the dirty thief!
You have his things?

46
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:45,913
- You knew him?
- Krasinsky, the locksmith?

47
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,447
He could open any trunk with a hair pin.

48
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,248
A thief? But he was blind!

49
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:02,238
Blind?
He could spot the police well a mile away.

50
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,574
I'll be dammed.

51
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,406
The work of the devil!

52
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,500
Can I be of any assistance, Father?

53
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,741
- This is yours?
- It is, but I demand an explanation.

54
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:40,411
Whatever you have here is unholy
and must be destroyed.

55
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:54,073
Inspector Mirov.
What is in there, Excellency?

56
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,660
Fossils.

57
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,031
What is a fossil?

58
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,873
A stone.

59
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,457
Stones?

60
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,700
There wouldn't be something valuable
in there like gold?

61
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,116
Gold?! It's a laboratory specimen.

62
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,122
No value to a thief.

63
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,406
Where there is God...

64
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:18,658
there is always a place for the cross.

65
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,872
Even on this stone floor, just so.

66
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:32,998
But Satan is evil and where evil is,
there is no place for the cross!

67
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,283
- Rubbish! A conjurer's trick. Captain.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,450
You get your men to put the crate on the train.

69
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,331
Ready?

70
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,323
Lift it up. 0ff you go.

71
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,741
(Bells tolling)

72
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,072
- Where is crate C?
- It's over there, sir.

73
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,199
Oh, yeah. Come on.

74
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,866
Be careful with this one.

75
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,998
Follow me!

76
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,739
(Snarling)

77
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,949
(Engine whistling)

78
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:45,964
What are you going to astound
the scientific world with this time?

79
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:48,793
You'll read about it
in the Society's annual report.

80
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:51,756
- It's a remarkable fossil.
- Fossil?

81
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,874
But you've got something live. I heard it.

82
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:58,001
- You're mistaken.
- You won't need to feed it, then?

83
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,083
The occupant hasn't eaten in two million years.

84
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:04,215
That's one way to economise on food bills.

85
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,255
Baggage man.

86
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,831
- Alinka, what's the matter with you?
- Yes, Countess?

87
00:14:15,883 --> 00:14:20,505
- You have a safe for valuables?
- Yes, Countess. I shall make out a receipt.

88
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:27,749
Excuse me.

89
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:35,042
Alinka's afraid of something.
What do you have in that crate?

90
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:38,836
Oh, nothing that would interest Alinka, Madame.

91
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:44,045
Normally she likes Englishmen.

92
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,706
- All we Poles do.
- I am honoured, Madame.

93
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:53,965
Oh, yes, England.
Queen Victoria, crumpets, Shakespeare.

94
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:59,796
I admire Poland, Madame, I believe that
there is a bond between our countries.

95
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:05,791
My husband, the Count Petrovski,
says that in the 15th century

96
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:10,464
your King Henry
betrayed us to the Russians, hm?

97
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:15,163
I hope you and your husband will accept
my profoundest apologies.

98
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:17,254
She's really afraid.

99
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:23,376
I wonder what it is.

100
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:26,542
May I escort you back to your carriage,
Madame?

101
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,624
(Train whistle)

102
00:15:55,217 --> 00:15:56,247
Yours?

103
00:15:57,925 --> 00:16:00,840
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

104
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,246
Yes?

105
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,164
I was on the platform before,
when that mad monk was carrying on.

106
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:11,590
- Yes?
- I'm an engineer, a scientist.

107
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,748
And this is ordinary chalk.

108
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,791
How do you explained it
not writing on that crate?

109
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:25,247
Hypnosis. Yoga.

110
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,625
These mystics can be very convincing.
They can even hypnotise themselves.

111
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,630
The fresh food we will pick up,
who will pay for it, sir?

112
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:48,716
Hmm? Oh, just keep an account
of how much you spend. Er...

113
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:55,257
lf... um... someone were to drill a little hole
in this crate during the night

114
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,130
and take a look at what's inside,
I'd be very grateful.

115
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,753
(Guard) That's in order.

116
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:27,083
Help me.

117
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,297
In what way, Madam?

118
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:39,964
- Is this number 8?
- That's next door, Wells' compartment.

119
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:44,205
There, there, don't cry.

120
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,541
Everything will be all right.

121
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,419
Excuse me.

122
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:58,626
Sorry, dear fellow, I'm afraid you're in the
wrong pew. Here, number 8, do you see?

123
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:02,675
8A, lower berth.

124
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,382
8B, upper berth.

125
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:10,205
Don't worry. I was supposed to have
this compartment to myself.

126
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,628
- If you don't mind.
- Sorry if I'm in your way.

127
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,882
Excuse me, I have no ticket
and I have to get out of Shanghai.

128
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:21,084
- I'm sure I can make it worth your while.
- The young lady's in trouble.

129
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,456
What do you suggest we do about it?

130
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:27,336
- Couldn't you double up with somebody else?
- Miss Jones?

131
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:31,754
I'm sure we can all get along
very well together.

132
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,330
(Man whistles tunefully)

133
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,798
(Clinking)

134
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,966
(Key drops on floor, padlock rattling)

135
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,960
(Tuneful whistling)

136
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:40,457
(Whistling)

137
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,588
(Whimpers)

138
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,669
There's the stink of hell on this train,
even the dog knows it.

139
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:07,390
When the Englishman comes to call,
what should I wear?

140
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,857
Sure of yourself, aren't you?

141
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,435
The blue one with the décolleté...

142
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,142
or perhaps the red one.

143
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,728
You are jesting with her immortal soul.

144
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:28,108
That's why we keep you, Pujardov.
0ur immortal souls are your concern.

145
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,691
(Whimpering)

146
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,355
She is afraid of something.

147
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:40,474
- Tell me, Pujardov...
- Yes?

148
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,891
Which do you think
I should wear for the Englishman?

149
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:47,023
- The red or the blue?
- Enough!

150
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,183
- I forbid you to talk this way.
- You forbid?

151
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:57,855
Forgive me, Your Excellency.

152
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,146
In my concern for the spiritual welfare
of the Countess, I forgot myself.

153
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,763
I will pray for humility.

154
00:23:09,192 --> 00:23:13,896
Pray hard, Pujardov
or you'll find yourself praying for a job, too.

155
00:23:13,942 --> 00:23:17,224
Hail Father and The Son and the Holy Ghost...

156
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,894
(Eerie whistling)

157
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:38,601
Oh, it's the piece I was playing.
I wonder who it is.

158
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:43,472
(Plays piece on the piano)

159
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,854
(Train whistle)

160
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,557
(Distant door opening)

161
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,267
You wish to see us?

162
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:26,061
I thought one of you might know
what happened to the baggage man.

163
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:29,142
- I haven't the remotest idea.
- What about you?

164
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,852
Perhaps it had something to do
with what's in that crate.

165
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,273
I agree with you. He was trying to open it
when something happened.

166
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,940
What?!

167
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,690
- Fortunately, he was interrupted.
- Yes. By whom?

168
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:54,309
Why are you so worried
about it being opened?

169
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:59,774
It may be my fault. I asked the baggage man
to take a look. I was curious.

170
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:01,891
It was no concern of yours.

171
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,605
0r of yours.

172
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:08,433
Goodnight.

173
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,480
One man dead, another missing.
It's time we opened this box.

174
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,811
You'll do no such thing!

175
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:19,560
Give me the key.

176
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,054
Konev, see if you can open the crate with that.

177
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,105
Go ahead!

178
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:27,556
My God... it's the baggage man.

179
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:31,144
- What was in there?!
- I told you, a fossil.

180
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:33,763
Part ape, part man.
It lived two million years ago.

181
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:37,941
Are you telling me that an ape
that lived two million years ago

182
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:41,266
got out of that crate,
killed the baggage man and put him in there,

183
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:44,268
then locked everything up neat and tidy
and got away?

184
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:48,227
- Yes, I am! It's alive, it must be!
- Lock him up.

185
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,972
We'll search the train and find it, whatever it is,
and destroy it.

186
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:55,189
- But if it's alive...
- I want this kept quiet!

187
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,722
I don't want to panic the passengers.

188
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,606
(Muffled scream)

189
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:15,766
My glass is empty.

190
00:30:16,442 --> 00:30:19,642
Oh, forgive me, my mind was elsewhere.

191
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:23,349
What is it?

192
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,067
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

193
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:34,358
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

194
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,058
Good evening.

195
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,224
Haven't we met?

196
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,313
I don't believe so.

197
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:46,475
Yes, at the Governor's palace. General Wang.

198
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:49,432
You're mistaken.

199
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:56,190
0f course. I beg your pardon.
It was somebody else.

200
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:11,358
What's the matter?

201
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,097
The eye of that fish, it's white.

202
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:18,891
Naturally, it's boiled.

203
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:23,142
Boiled... yes.

204
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:33,975
- Is it true you're a doctor?
- Ask me when I've finished my dinner.

205
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,355
- It's urgent.
- What are the symptoms?

206
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,264
He's dead, you saw him.
- Oh, that one.

207
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,603
There's nothing I can do for him.

208
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,063
Now there's one more dead.
One of my soldiers, same white eyes.

209
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:50,106
- I want to know the cause of death.
- Who's dead?

210
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,520
Keep your nose out of it!
You didn't hear anything.

211
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,606
Excuse me.

212
00:31:58,608 --> 00:32:01,179
Is Professor Saxton's fossil still at large?

213
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:05,606
I think the fossil or whatever it is escaped,
jumped off the train.

214
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:15,184
- Miss Jones, I shall need your assistance.
- Yes, well, at your age, I'm not surprised.

215
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:21,938
- With an autopsy!
- Oh, well, that's different.

216
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,855
Very curious.

217
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:42,057
A genetic defect, obviously.

218
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,974
- Scalpel.
- Uh-hm.

219
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,391
Can you keep that still.

220
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,389
- (Man) What is he doing?
- Trepan.

221
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,432
Don't get up, please.

222
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:25,223
I see you have decided to dine alone,
Sir Alexander.

223
00:33:26,483 --> 00:33:30,524
I've eaten in worse circumstances
and in worse company.

224
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:37,516
Handsaw.

225
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,641
Here you are, Doctor.

226
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:51,723
You're in bad humour because
you've lost your box of bones.

227
00:33:56,192 --> 00:34:01,394
That "box of bones", Madame, could have
solved many of the riddles of science.

228
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:07,685
If the theory of evolution is confirmed,
if the science of biology is revolutionised,

229
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:10,435
if the very origin of man is determined...

230
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:14,180
I have heard of evolution, it's... it's immoral.

231
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:18,476
It's a fact... and there's no morality in a fact.

232
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:29,768
And what about the baggage man
and that poor thief at the station?

233
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,567
- What about them?
- They are dead.

234
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,474
Was your creature responsible for that?

235
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:41,892
Probably.

236
00:34:42,983 --> 00:34:45,650
And you don't care?

237
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,982
A baggage man and a thief?

238
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:57,061
You're right, Madame,

239
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:00,391
I don't care as much as I should.

240
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,771
Can you tell me how he died?

241
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:14,432
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
You saw this man today and he was normal?

242
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:18,429
- Absolutely.
- It must be a mutation, a freak of nature.

243
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,268
What's so special about this brain?

244
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:26,602
Learning and memory
are engraved on the normal brain,

245
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,565
leaving a wrinkled surface.

246
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,606
This brain has been drained,
the memory has been removed

247
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,098
like chalk erased from a blackboard.

248
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,474
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

249
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,804
Thank you. It's all yours.

250
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:41,480
I won't be long.

251
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,064
Miss? It's Doctor Wells.

252
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:26,266
Miss, are you all right?

253
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,938
Miss, are you there?

254
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:16,810
(Gunshot)

255
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:26,563
(Creature growling)

256
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,182
(Snarling)

257
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:57,183
(Gunshot)

258
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:02,475
(Knocking)

259
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,773
Come in.

260
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,308
Feeling better?

261
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:12,265
Yes.

262
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:14,391
Anything wrong?

263
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:19,229
That woman who was killed -
the engineer, you know, the chess player,

264
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:22,143
he told me that she was an international spy.

265
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:26,479
- Yes, I know.
- Oh, you do?

266
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:30,056
Well, could that fact have had anything
to do with her death?

267
00:42:30,108 --> 00:42:32,016
What do you think?

268
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:36,439
Doctor Wells and I performed
an autopsy on her.

269
00:42:36,483 --> 00:42:39,849
Her brain was completely smooth,
just like the baggage man's.

270
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,768
Everything had been erased.
I have a theory about this.

271
00:42:42,817 --> 00:42:46,431
I'm only a policeman, Professor,
I don't have much education.

272
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:51,145
Well, I'll make it simple.

273
00:42:51,192 --> 00:42:54,806
Supposing that creature, the one you killed,

274
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:58,306
was capable of taking ideas
directly from other people's brains

275
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:00,645
and transferring them to its own.

276
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:05,811
- You mean it sucked other people's brains?
- Absorbed, through the eyes.

277
00:43:09,567 --> 00:43:12,979
That was our first clue. The eyes going white.

278
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:17,355
Then if the beast had absorbed your brains,

279
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,310
all of your education
would have gone into its brain.

280
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:23,847
It would have been as clever as you.

281
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,431
Much more so
because what it had taken from me

282
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:31,098
would have been added to the learning
that it already had.

283
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,096
Professor, spy, baggage man, thief.

284
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,103
What was the creature looking for?

285
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,226
Well, that we'll never know
now that it's dead and yet...

286
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:44,933
What?

287
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:48,975
A creature like that...

288
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:51,480
how would it ever die?

289
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:55,017
- Inspector?
- What is it?

290
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:57,769
I found this. The animal had it.

291
00:43:57,817 --> 00:44:00,388
- (Saxton) The animal had it?
- Give it to me!

292
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:05,181
- It belonged to Count Petrovski.
- How do you know?

293
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:07,900
I saw him put it in the safe.

294
00:44:18,775 --> 00:44:23,516
Steel - harder than a diamond.
That's why the spies are after it.

295
00:44:24,233 --> 00:44:28,807
The French, German, English.
But they are wasting their time.

296
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:32,685
What really matters is the formula

297
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:37,142
and that, gentleman, is safe... up here.

298
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,816
What happened to the girl? The spy.

299
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:49,018
She's dead.
The fossil or whatever it was killed her.

300
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:52,065
- But there's no more danger.
- The beast is not dead.

301
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:54,146
I put four bullets into him.

302
00:44:57,067 --> 00:45:00,183
You think evil can be killed with bullets?

303
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,641
Satan lives.

304
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:08,934
The unholy one... is among us!

305
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:13,605
Oh, Shalom, Shalom, Shalom. Oh, Shalom.

306
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,523
Specimen jar.

307
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:53,732
- What do you expect to find in the eye fluid?
- I don't know.

308
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,180
- Why, this is incredible.
- What?

309
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,929
It's the last thing the creature saw!

310
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,726
- The police inspector.
- The image has been retained in the fluid.

311
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:46,056
Exactly. The creature's visual memory
is located not in its brain but in the eye itself.

312
00:47:28,608 --> 00:47:30,480
Can you identify anything?

313
00:47:31,317 --> 00:47:33,391
It's a brontosaurus!

314
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,688
A pterodactyl.

315
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,807
(Train whistle)

316
00:48:08,317 --> 00:48:10,189
(Saxton) Incredible.

317
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:13,561
This is not a map.

318
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:18,563
(Saxton) It can only be the Earth
seen from space.

319
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:24,228
I hope I'm not intruding. People on the train
are becoming afraid, Professor.

320
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:30,224
People on long journeys become bored,
Madame. They crave excitement.

321
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:34,931
- Then there's no more danger?
- It's all finished.

322
00:48:36,442 --> 00:48:40,305
And what about your science?
The evolution you were talking about?

323
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,855
Look for yourself.

324
00:48:57,358 --> 00:48:59,432
Come here, Pujardov.

325
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,602
There's something I want to show you.

326
00:49:08,317 --> 00:49:09,975
Look.

327
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:21,148
(Russian)

328
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:28,811
It is the Holy Writ.

329
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,395
On the second day, he created the earth.

330
00:49:39,525 --> 00:49:41,183
Where did you get it?

331
00:49:42,275 --> 00:49:44,396
There, from the creature's eye.

332
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:54,688
- The eye of Satan!
- Nonsense. There's a scientific explanation.

333
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,016
Do you know it?

334
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,024
No.

335
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:03,980
Not yet.

336
00:50:06,942 --> 00:50:12,559
Before the fall, before Satan
was banished from the throne of God,

337
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:17,266
the Evil One looked down from heaven
and did see...

338
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:18,596
Rubbish!

339
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,557
Pujardov!

340
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:47,013
- Pujardov? Where is he?
- I don't know.

341
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,188
He's gone mad.

342
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:57,097
- I'll look in the baggage car.
- Right.

343
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:06,354
- Looking for the thief, Miss Jones?
- You know about it.

344
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:10,268
What's all the fuss?

345
00:52:13,775 --> 00:52:17,603
You get back that eye
and there's a thousand roubles in it for you.

346
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:21,310
A thousand rubbles for an eye?

347
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:25,349
There's something in it.

348
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,517
- Pictures.
- Pictures of what?

349
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:37,097
Pictures of the earth in prehistoric times.
Pictures of the earth seen from space.

350
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:40,016
Who else has seen such pictures?

351
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:45,857
Dr Wells, Professor Saxton
and that pretty Countess.

352
00:52:46,692 --> 00:52:48,350
I see.

353
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,347
Have pity, have pity.

354
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:03,849
Are you going to kill me?

355
00:54:06,483 --> 00:54:09,814
Fool. There's nothing in your head of any use.

356
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,974
Another killing.

357
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,810
- (Man) Stop the train! I want to get off!
- (Woman) There's no law!

358
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:34,769
Quiet!
There's been talk about getting off the train.

359
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:38,099
- Well, you can forget it.
- I'll complain to the authorities.

360
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:43,305
- I'm not one of your muzhiks!
- I'll shoot anyone who tries to stop the train.

361
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:46,273
Shoot?! Shoot?! You stupid Russian!

362
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,389
<i>(Inspector) Who else has seen</i>
<i>such pictures?</i>

363
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:07,226
<i>(Dr Jones) Dr Wells...</i>

364
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:10,107
<i>Professor Saxton...</i>

365
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:14,144
<i>and that pretty Countess.</i>
<i>Wells, Saxton and the Countess.</i>

366
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:17,723
<i>Wells, Saxton and the Countess</i>
<i>Wells, Saxton and the Countess...</i>

367
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,731
Wells, is this creature dead or not?

368
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:33,933
If it is, who killed Miss Jones?

369
00:55:37,192 --> 00:55:41,232
- Do you have any idea?
- No, Inspector, I haven't.

370
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:44,605
I've asked the conductor to wire ahead
to stop at the next station.

371
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:00,064
What's the idea?

372
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,391
Tell me who you are.

373
00:56:34,567 --> 00:56:37,518
Tell me. I will serve you.

374
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:53,191
I want to help you.

375
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:56,267
It's like some contagious disease.

376
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:59,647
Well, if there's a disease,
there must be symptoms.

377
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:03,732
- Fever?
- You could take everyone's temperature.

378
00:57:03,775 --> 00:57:06,808
The eyes, why do their eyes go white?

379
00:57:27,192 --> 00:57:30,723
Do you think it's true what they say
about those horrible white eyes?

380
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:33,310
Oh, that part is true enough.

381
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:41,142
- Ah, Inspector, there's only you now.
- What about me?

382
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:44,688
Your eyes. We must examine your eyes, too.

383
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:48,600
Certainly.

384
00:57:56,592 --> 00:58:00,336
Perhaps you should test for radiation
or other invisible rays.

385
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:05,918
X-rays? Well it's a thought,
but on this train how would we go about it?

386
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,959
- Are you a scientist?
- An engineer, but I try to keep up with things.

387
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:14,834
That's to be admired.

388
00:58:14,883 --> 00:58:20,501
Inspector, I suggest you tell all these people
to stay together, in groups or in pairs,

389
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:24,414
so that if anything does happen to anybody,
then somebody can raise the alarm.

390
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:26,753
On no account must anybody be left alone.

391
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:44,082
(Engine whistle)

392
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,874
(Ringing)

393
00:59:15,425 --> 00:59:17,830
(Ringing)

394
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:30,207
News of the train.

395
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:50,080
The train will be here in exactly...

396
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:53,581
um... 14 minutes.

397
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,378
(Man) 14 minutes?

398
00:59:57,425 --> 01:00:00,340
Yes, Your Honour, that's what it says here.

399
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:10,957
Doesn't say it in words, Your Honour,
but in code. It's like another language.

400
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:14,374
I know about telegraph, Little Papa.

401
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:17,423
I know about trains,
I know about electrical currents.

402
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,088
On your feet, everybody!

403
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:29,418
Outside, full pack! Even though I still believe
in God, I don't like to be made a fool of!

404
01:00:29,467 --> 01:00:31,955
No, Your Honour.

405
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:37,046
I wouldn't do that.

406
01:00:40,008 --> 01:00:42,876
Tell me, Little Father...

407
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:44,999
do you believe in the devil?

408
01:00:47,633 --> 01:00:49,007
Yes.

409
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,789
Ah, good, send a telegram.

410
01:00:55,508 --> 01:00:57,914
Tell them that Captain Kazan,

411
01:00:57,967 --> 01:01:03,999
he knows that a horses has four legs,
he knows that a murderer has two arms,

412
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,539
but still the devil...

413
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:12,829
must be afraid of one honest Cossack, hm?

414
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:38,297
Earth's gravity, you know how to measure it?

415
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:40,379
How to measure gravity?

416
01:01:41,217 --> 01:01:44,796
What I would like to know is
can gravity be overcome?

417
01:01:46,758 --> 01:01:51,416
If you mean, can man get beyond
the gravitational field of the earth into space,

418
01:01:51,467 --> 01:01:53,623
not yet, but any day now.

419
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,584
Someday?

420
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:59,548
There is a mathematics professor,
his name is Chelkovsky.

421
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:03,799
He has ideas about rockets, machines
that can fly free of the earth's gravity.

422
01:02:05,717 --> 01:02:07,791
You know him?

423
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:15,376
Chelkovsky was one of my teachers,
he was like a father to me.

424
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:19,588
But why would a man like you be interest...

425
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,214
What do you think is behind all this, Excellency?

426
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:59,795
Look at this.
That's what we saw under the microscope.

427
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:04,250
- Shows the Earth as it might look from space.
- What does it mean?

428
01:03:04,883 --> 01:03:09,836
It means that millions of years ago something,
some form of intelligence,

429
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:12,289
came to the Earth from another planet.

430
01:03:12,342 --> 01:03:16,170
The atmosphere of the earth was new to it,
different.

431
01:03:16,217 --> 01:03:19,665
- But it learnt how to survive.
- How?

432
01:03:19,717 --> 01:03:25,085
By entering into the body and brain
of an Earth creature.

433
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:27,622
The fossil that I found and brought with me.

434
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:30,839
And this thing from another planet
survived in the fossil?

435
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:33,419
- Then came to life again?
- Exactly.

436
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:35,541
Go on, Professor.

437
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:43,454
The animal that you shot was only the host
and, when that animal died,

438
01:03:43,508 --> 01:03:49,208
the alien intelligence
transferred somehow to another host.

439
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:55,923
It's alive... in someone on this train.

440
01:03:56,758 --> 01:03:58,630
You're a very good detective.

441
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:02,834
You've discovered everything
except who is now the host.

442
01:04:02,883 --> 01:04:06,545
- That's our next step.
- Thought this might come in handy.

443
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:10,088
- Oh, good idea.
- Two of you together, that's fine.

444
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:16,545
- But what if one of you is the monster?
- Monster? We're British, you know.

445
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:28,254
But you must have seen something.

446
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,504
I told you, I was asleep.

447
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:35,133
He knew about the white eyes, he told me.

448
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:40,459
When you fell asleep, the lights were on?
And when you woke up?

449
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:43,079
- They were off.
- Are you sure?

450
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:50,125
Positive. It was dark. I put the lights on.
And that's when I found him... beside me.

451
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,215
When we did the test, the lights were on.

452
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:59,007
Master!

453
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,591
Inspector.

454
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:40,123
This steel at high temperatures,
what happens to it?

455
01:05:43,842 --> 01:05:47,421
It gets stronger.
What temperatures, for example?

456
01:05:48,008 --> 01:05:50,248
Ten or twelve thousand degrees.

457
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:53,464
Where on earth
would you get such temperatures?

458
01:05:53,508 --> 01:05:55,582
Nowhere on Earth.

459
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,006
(Brakes screeching)

460
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:37,998
The Tsar will hear of this!
I'll have you sent to Siberia!

461
01:06:40,592 --> 01:06:42,666
I am in Siberia.

462
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:47,670
This is Countess Irina Petrovska
and I am Count Maryan Petrovski.

463
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:50,584
Oh, Your Excellencies, I am sorry.

464
01:06:51,467 --> 01:06:55,164
0f course, the Count and Countess
are exempt from our orders.

465
01:06:55,217 --> 01:06:58,547
Please, escort them to their car.

466
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:11,707
Peasants. Peasants!

467
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:22,792
Are you a Countess?

468
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:27,049
I'm an American and I'm not accustomed
to being bullied by foreigners.

469
01:07:27,092 --> 01:07:31,251
That man, he's the one who wouldn't
let us get off the train, he's responsible.

470
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:43,041
- Your Excellency, I am a Police Inspector.
- Everybody is under arrest!

471
01:07:47,508 --> 01:07:49,416
Including you.

472
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:55,044
Who are the killers?
Who? Who are the trouble-makers?

473
01:08:02,217 --> 01:08:04,291
Who are the foreign influences, huh?

474
01:08:06,467 --> 01:08:08,007
Who?!

475
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:13,922
Don't worry, I'll smoke them out.

476
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:16,290
What's he raving about?

477
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:30,966
- You English believe in free speech, huh?
- Certainly.

478
01:08:31,008 --> 01:08:34,753
If instead of babbling nonsense,
you'd investigate this properly...

479
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,874
This is outrageous!

480
01:08:38,925 --> 01:08:44,258
So... you are a police inspector, huh?

481
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,919
Yes, Captain. Mirov is my name.

482
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:50,130
Mirov? Oh, Mirov!

483
01:08:51,592 --> 01:08:53,961
That's a good Russian name, Mirov.

484
01:08:56,133 --> 01:09:01,751
Tell me, Mirov, what do you know about
all the filth that's going on here, huh?

485
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,130
- Filth?
- Certainly you know what I'm doing here.

486
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:11,126
You just point out the suspects
and I promise you I'll get the truth out of them.

487
01:09:11,175 --> 01:09:13,498
You're mistaken, sir.

488
01:09:14,508 --> 01:09:17,127
- Mistaken?
- Fool!

489
01:09:25,383 --> 01:09:28,085
Get back, get back!

490
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:32,506
Back! 0r I will put a curse on your heads!

491
01:09:36,925 --> 01:09:38,501
He has the evil eye!

492
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:51,164
Beware of the wrath of Satan!

493
01:10:07,425 --> 01:10:09,083
Fool, huh?

494
01:10:12,175 --> 01:10:14,296
On your knees, monk.

495
01:10:31,508 --> 01:10:33,167
We must stop this.

496
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:59,290
- He was trying to protect you, why?
- He's mad.

497
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:06,670
- Who are you?
- I told you, a policeman.

498
01:11:30,508 --> 01:11:32,380
No!

499
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:48,378
No!

500
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:50,960
You saw his eyes!
One look at them and you're dead!

501
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:07,670
Come into me, Satan!

502
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:13,789
Thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory!

503
01:12:15,425 --> 01:12:19,917
Thy will be done on earth as it is in hell.

504
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:27,207
Now, anything!
Anything that moves near that door, kill it!

505
01:12:28,717 --> 01:12:32,876
- But what if the monk is innocent?
- Ah, we got lots of innocent monks!

506
01:12:32,925 --> 01:12:36,670
All right, let's move these peasants out of here!
Quickly!

507
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,464
Everybody back to the baggage car. Hurry!

508
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:42,043
There!

509
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:49,420
He always kills in the dark,
he can't play his tricks in a strong light.

510
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:09,290
- Take care of the others.
- What about you?

511
01:17:09,342 --> 01:17:12,044
- I'll be all right, go on.
- Well, you take this.

512
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,465
(Train whistle)

513
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:42,375
You know, in spite of everything,
Pujardov had a certain affection for you.

514
01:17:45,633 --> 01:17:51,251
Yet you humiliated often,
even in front of the Countess.

515
01:18:38,008 --> 01:18:41,339
(Sobbing) He's dead.

516
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:45,542
You killed him!

517
01:18:45,592 --> 01:18:49,004
If you want to kill Pujardov, it's too late.

518
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:54,756
- I'll see you hanged!
- Ah, poor monk.

519
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,208
He loved you
more than he loved the promise of heaven.

520
01:19:04,425 --> 01:19:08,371
0ver there, quickly, over there!
Irina, behind me.

521
01:19:16,467 --> 01:19:18,541
It would be a mistake to kill me.

522
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:23,795
- Who are you?
- In words, it's difficult.

523
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:27,124
I am a form of energy occupying this shell.

524
01:19:29,425 --> 01:19:33,253
- Where do you come from?
- Another galaxy.

525
01:19:36,008 --> 01:19:37,880
I came with others like myself.

526
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:42,879
I was left behind. An accident.

527
01:19:42,925 --> 01:19:47,547
I survived in protozoans, fish, vertebrates.

528
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:52,549
The history of your planet is part of me.

529
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:58,295
Pull the trigger and you will end it.

530
01:20:01,925 --> 01:20:04,211
What am I to do with you?

531
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:08,341
- Let me go.
- That's not possible.

532
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:10,789
It is possible.

533
01:20:12,217 --> 01:20:17,088
I will teach you to end disease, pain, hunger.

534
01:20:20,008 --> 01:20:21,039
Wait!

535
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:25,377
There is something more.

536
01:21:13,425 --> 01:21:15,996
- Saxton!
- (Gunshot)

537
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:22,039
Go!

538
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:38,254
Yahhhh!

539
01:21:45,925 --> 01:21:48,460
(Irina screaming)

540
01:21:49,842 --> 01:21:52,330
Let me go! Oh, no!

541
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,381
(Shrieking)

542
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:57,041
(Train whistle)

543
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,916
Saxton, thank God!

544
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,379
Stand back, please, make room.

545
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:06,795
Moscow says to stop the Express
when it goes through the switching point.

546
01:24:11,842 --> 01:24:15,290
Derail it?
That means killing everybody on board!

547
01:24:18,133 --> 01:24:20,373
That's what it says.

548
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:25,415
Maybe there's a war. Maybe it's war.

549
01:25:03,675 --> 01:25:05,582
(Screaming)

550
01:25:54,175 --> 01:25:56,415
(Eerie whistling)

551
01:25:57,305 --> 01:26:57,167
