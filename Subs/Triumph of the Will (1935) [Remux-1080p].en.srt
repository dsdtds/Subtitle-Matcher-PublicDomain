The General Field Marshal is remembered
as the first soldier of the Great War.

31
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:43,512
And thoughts as well
to our fallen comrades.

I greet the high representatives

in this day for their political parties.

especially to the representatives
of the Armed Forces here,
now under the orders of the Führer!

36
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,157
My Leader:

37
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:28,098
Around you stand the flags and standards
of <i>this</i> National Socialism.

38
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:32,159
Only when they are threadbare...

39
00:26:32,237 --> 00:26:35,934
will the people
be able to understand...

40
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:41,913
by hindsight,
the greatness of our time...

41
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,576
because of what you, my Leader,
mean to Germany!

42
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,801
You are Germany!

43
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:07,202
When <i>you</i> act, the <i>Nation</i> acts.

44
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:11,265
When <i>you</i> judge, the <i>People</i> judge.

45
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:31,287
Our thanks is the vow
to stand with you...

46
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:35,561

<i>Reich Minister Dr. Paul Josef Goebbels</i>

49
00:27:52,717 --> 00:28:00,988
Thanks to your leadership, Germany
will be attainable as the homeland.

50
00:28:05,964 --> 00:28:09,024
Homeland for all Germans in the world.

51
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:20,444
To us you were the guarantor of victory.

52
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:25,074
To us you <i>are</i> the guarantor of peace!

53

Adolf Hitler: <i>Hail Victory.!</i>

54
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:32,790
<i>Hail Victory.! Hail Victory.!</i>

55
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:50,638
From the proclamation of the Führer
read by Wagner

56
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:53,872
<i>Adolf Wagner, Gauleiter of Munich-Upper</i>
<i>Bavaria Adolf Bavarian Interior Minister</i>
<i>& SA-</i>Obergruppenführer

57
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,745
No revolution
that seems to be permanent...

58
00:28:57,816 --> 00:29:01,809
can lead to anything other
than complete anarchy.

59
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:05,323
So the World will <i>not</i> live at war.

60
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,656
So also the people
do not live on revolution.

61
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:17,324
Nothing on this earth that has lasted
for thousands of years...

62
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:22,339
was assembled in mere decades.

63
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:28,835
The largest tree also has
the longest period of growth.

64
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:32,179
What braves the centuries...

65
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,084
will also be strong
through the centuries.

66
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:41,351
<i>Alfred Rosenberg, Reichsleiter</i>
<i>and later Reich Minister</i>
<i>for annexed Eastern Territories</i>

67
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:46,193
It is our unshakeable belief
in ourselves...

68
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:50,701
that is our hope for the youth...

69
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:58,869
to carry on the work which has been put
before them in the stormy years...

70
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:04,382
of the revolt of 1918 in Munich...

71
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:10,945
and which is already part
of the entire German nation's history.

72
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:16,116
<i>Dr. Otto Dietrich, Reichsleiter</i>
<i>and Reich Press Chief in Ministry</i>
<i>of People Enlightenment and Propaganda</i>

73
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:18,958
Truth is the foundation...

74
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,057
on which the power of the press
stands in the world.

75
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:26,228
And that it reports the truth
about Germany...

76
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:32,300
is the only demand that we place
on the foreign press.

77
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:37,205
<i>Dr Fritz Todt, Reich General Inspector</i>
<i>of Highways and Construction</i>
<i>and Minister of Armaments and Munitions</i>

78
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:42,743
As I speak, work on the Reich Autobahn
has begun at 51 locations.

79
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,484
Although this work
is in its early stage...

80
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,756
today there are already
52,000 men on the job...

81
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:55,596
and another 100,000...

82
00:30:55,667 --> 00:31:00,661
engaged in the work
of allied industries.

83

<i>Fritz Reinhardt, State Secretary</i>
<i>in the Reich Ministry of Finance</i>
<i>and SA</i> Obergruppenführer

84
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:09,940
Wherever we look,
all around there is building...

85
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:14,679
and new creations...

86
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:18,280
and activity and life...

87
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:21,689
which will continue into the future.

88
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,052
<i>Richard-Walther Darré,</i>
<i>Reich Agricultural Leader, Head of</i>
<i>Central Office of Race and Resettlement</i>

89
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:30,795
Maintaining the health of our farmers
is the primary foundation...

90
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,963
for the prosperity of industry...

91
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,703
for German business
and for foreign exports.

92
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:43,306
<i>Julius Streicher,</i>
<i>Gauleiter of Upper Franconia</i>
<i>and Editor of</i> "Der Stürmer"

93
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:50,378

the purity of its race, goes to seed!

00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:54,658
<i>Dr. Robert Ley, Reichsleiter</i>
<i>and Head of the German Labor Front</i>
<i>(DAF-</i> Deutsche Arbeitsfront)

95
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:59,823
All our work must be dictated
by a single thought...

96
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:02,833
that the German worker...

97
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:09,238
be made an upright, proud
and equally entitled national comrade.

98
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:13,306
<i>Dr. Hans Frank,</i>
<i>Reichs Minister of Justice and later</i>
<i>Governor General of occupied Poland</i>

99
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:17,337
As the Leader
of the German legal service...

100
00:32:17,415 --> 00:32:22,512
I can say that, clearly, the basis
of the National Socialist State...

101
00:32:22,587 --> 00:32:25,522
is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.

102
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,187
And <i>for us our highest leader</i>
<i>is also the highest judge.!</i>

103
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:41,204
We know how sacred the principles
of these laws are to our Führer.

104
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:45,868
These Reich laws can assure you,
National Comrades...

105
00:32:45,944 --> 00:32:51,780
that your life and existence <i>is safe</i>

<i>and later</i>
<i>General Plenipotentiary for Total War</i>

108
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:08,062
May the bright flame of our enthusiasm
never be extinguished.

109
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:11,899
It alone gives light and warmth...

110
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:16,236
to the creative art
of modern political propaganda.

111
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:20,744
This comes
from the depths of the People...

112
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:25,078
and from these depths of the people...

113
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:31,248
it must always again
find its roots and its strength.

114
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:38,091
It may be good to possess power
based on strength...

115
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:46,662
but it is better to win
and hold the heart of a People.

<i>Konstantin Hierl, Reichsarbeitsführer,</i>
<i>Head of the German Labor Service</i>

We work in the swamp.

And in the sand.

156
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:31,727
We dam the North Sea.

We plant trees.

We build roads...

00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:44,865
from town to town,
and city to city.

160
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:47,877
We provide the farmer

180
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:54,027

by the Red Front and Reactionaries...

My Labor Service Men.

184
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:23,590
For the first time you are presented
for review in this forum...

185
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:30,368
before me
and before the German people.

186
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:34,935
You represent a great idea...

187
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:40,473
and we know that for millions
of our national comrades...

188
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:45,648
physical labor will not longer
be a divisive concept.

189
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:49,385
But it will instead bind us together
and, furthermore...

190
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,989
no longer will it be the case
in Germany...

191
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:59,297
that physical labor will be seen
as anything less...

192
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,328
than any other work.

193
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:08,344
The whole nation passes
through your school.

194
00:40:08,412 --> 00:40:12,508
The time will come
when no German...

195
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:18,180
can be admitted
into the community of the people...

196
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:23,522
until he has first become a member
of <i>your</i> group.

197
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:27,587
And you know that today
you are not only being seen...

198
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:31,361
by the thousands in Nuremberg,
but by all of Germany...

199
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:36,262
which also sees you here
for the first time today.

200
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:46,038
And I know that just as you serve
this Germany proudly...

201
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:53,318
all of Germany today will see its sons
marching in you with proud joy!

205
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:36,210
Many of you here tonight knew me...

206
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:42,246
as an SA man...

207
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:46,318
marching in the rank and file...

208
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:50,264
in the first years of the Movement.

209
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:56,294
And Party Comrades,
just as I was an SA man then...

210
00:42:56,372 --> 00:43:00,035
so I am still an SA man today!

211
00:43:08,017 --> 00:43:15,947
We SA workers will always be true
only to the Führer...

212
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:19,392

We live again for this hour
which makes us proud and happy.

224
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:25,354
According to your command, my Leader,
a youth stands here...

225
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:31,422
a youth that knows
neither class nor caste.

226
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:38,337
The young generation of our people
follows after you.

227
00:48:38,406 --> 00:48:46,074
Just as you demonstrate the highest
self-sacrifice in this Nation...

228
00:48:46,147 --> 00:48:50,413
so does this youth wish to be selfless.

229
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:54,854
Because you embody
the concept of fidelity for us...

230
00:48:54,923 --> 00:49:00,793
therefore we wish to be faithful.

231
00:49:00,862 --> 00:49:06,095
Adolf Hitler,

232
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,953
My German youth.

233
00:49:30,024 --> 00:49:35,587
After one year
I can greet you again here.

234
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:42,000
You standing here today
represent something...

235
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:48,270
that is happening all over Germany.

236
00:49:48,343 --> 00:49:54,509
And we want that you,
German boys and girls...

237
00:49:56,417 --> 00:50:03,380
will absorb everything
that we wish for Germany.

238
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,791
We want to be one people...

239
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:13,460
and through you,
to become this people.

240
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:17,470
We want a society with
neither castes nor ranks.

241
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:23,135
And you must not allow
these ideas to grow within you.

242
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:27,375
We want to see <i>one Reich.!</i>

243
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:31,680
And you must educate yourselves
for this.

244
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:36,019
We want this people to be obedient...

245
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:39,491
and you must practice obedience
in yourselves.

246
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,826
We want this people
to be <i>peace-loving...</i>

247
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:46,162
but at the same time <i>to be courageous.</i>

248
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:49,226
And you must, for that reason,
be both <i>peace-loving...</i>

249
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:15,419
You must be both <i>peace-loving</i>
and strong.

250
00:51:25,273 --> 00:51:31,212
We want this people
not to become soft...

251
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:34,737
but to become hard and, therefore...

252
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:40,311
you must steel yourselves for this
in your youth.

253
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:44,848
You must learn sacrifice...

254
00:51:44,926 --> 00:51:51,331
and also never to collapse.

255
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:54,800
Whatever we create today...

256
00:51:54,869 --> 00:51:58,066
whatever we do...

257
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:00,573
will all pass away...

258
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:03,872
but in you Germany will live on.

259
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:08,075
And when we can no longer hold...

260
00:52:08,149 --> 00:52:13,177
the flag <i>that we tore from nothing...</i>

261
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:16,451
you must hold it firmly in your fists!

262
00:52:31,205 --> 00:52:34,003
And I know
that it cannot be any other way...

263
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:36,703
as we bind ourselves together.

264
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:43,445
For you are <i>flesh of our flesh</i>
<i>and blood from our blood.!</i>

265
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:45,816
The same spirit that governs us...

266
00:52:45,887 --> 00:52:49,015
burns in your young minds.

267
00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:02,402
And when the great columns
of the movement...

268
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:08,807
sweep through Germany today...

269
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:15,372
then I know that you will close ranks...

270
00:53:22,056 --> 00:53:25,150
and we know <i>that Germany</i>
<i>lies in front of us...</i>

271
00:53:25,226 --> 00:53:27,660
<i>Germany marches within us...</i>

272
00:53:27,728 --> 00:53:31,061

279
00:59:00,946 --> 00:59:05,713
Ayear ago...

280
00:59:06,886 --> 00:59:11,755
we met for the first time
on this field:

281
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:19,128
the first general review
of political leaders...

282
00:59:19,198 --> 00:59:23,134
of the National Socialist Party.

283
00:59:23,202 --> 00:59:27,502
200,000 men have assembled here.

284
00:59:27,573 --> 00:59:35,002
They are not here
at the summons of their hearts alone...

285
00:59:35,081 --> 00:59:39,575
but also at the summons
of their loyalty.

286
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:57,701
It was the great calamity of our people
that drove us to the struggle...

287
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:05,040
brought us together...

288
01:00:05,111 --> 01:00:07,375
and left us greater.

289
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:11,041
Those who do not understand...

290
01:00:11,117 --> 01:00:15,952
have not experienced
the same calamities among their people.

291
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:28,563
These things appear
enigmatic and mysterious...

292
01:00:28,634 --> 01:00:33,901
that hundreds of thousands
would be led to assemble...

293
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:39,070
amidst calamity and passion.

294
01:00:39,145 --> 01:00:42,581
Others cannot understand...

295
01:00:42,648 --> 01:00:47,142
that this is not
an order of the <i>State.!</i>

296
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:50,416
<i>They are deceiving themselves.!</i>

297
01:00:50,489 --> 01:00:54,585
<i>The State does not order us.!</i>

298
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,151
<i>We order the State.!</i>

299
01:01:07,106 --> 01:01:11,770
<i>The State did not create us.!</i>

300
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:15,405
<i>Rather we created our own State.!</i>

301
01:01:19,752 --> 01:01:24,451
No, the movement lives...

302
01:01:24,523 --> 01:01:30,325
and it is grounded hard and fast.

303
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:36,926
And as long as one of us
can draw a breath...

304
01:01:37,002 --> 01:01:42,065
he will give his strengths
to the movement...

305
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:49,047
just as it was in yesteryear.

306
01:01:49,114 --> 01:01:52,641
Then drum will join drum...

307
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:54,811
flag will join flag...

308
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:59,984
group will join group,
Gau to Gau...

309
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:04,826
and after that,
this earlier divided people...

310
01:02:04,897 --> 01:02:10,199
will follow these sacred columns
of the Nation.

311
01:02:19,078 --> 01:02:25,347
It would be an outrage
if we were to lose...

312
01:02:25,417 --> 01:02:30,184
what we have fought for...

313
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:33,692
with so much labor,
so much worry...

314
01:02:33,759 --> 01:02:37,422
so much sacrifice,
and so many privations.

315
01:02:53,412 --> 01:02:59,214
One cannot live faithfully
and give up...

316
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:04,723
what has given meaning and purpose
to one's entire life.

317
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:09,727
That would not be so...

318
01:03:09,795 --> 01:03:16,428
if it were not a cardinal command.

319
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:21,633
And no earthly power
gave us that command.

320
01:03:22,975 --> 01:03:28,470
<i>For the God, our God, who created</i>
<i>our people, gave us that command.!</i>

321
01:03:35,654 --> 01:03:39,454
So it is our vow this evening...

322
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:45,925
that <i>each hour, on every day...</i>

323
01:03:45,998 --> 01:03:50,094
to think <i>only of Germany</i>
<i>of the People and Reich...</i>

324
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:54,435
<i>and of our German nation.!</i>

325

01:12:15,433 --> 01:12:19,494
A few months ago...

341
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:25,099
a dark shadow cast itself
across our Movement.

342
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:30,614
The SA and other institutions
of the Party...

343
01:12:30,682 --> 01:12:37,110
had nothing whatsoever to do
with this shadow.

344
01:12:39,424 --> 01:12:46,694
They who would believe that a rift has
opened in the unity of the Movement...

345
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:51,531
deceive themselves.

346
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:57,404
<i>It stands fast as this block here...</i>

347
01:12:57,475 --> 01:13:05,246
and nothing in Germany
will break it.

348
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:12,085
And when anyone does harm
to the spirit of <i>my</i> SA...

349
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:16,092
then the SA will not be harmed...

350
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:19,027
but those who do this harm...

351
01:13:19,097 --> 01:13:23,500
will injure only themselves!

352
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:39,609
And only a fool
or a known liar...

353
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:44,781
could think...

354
01:13:44,856 --> 01:13:50,317
that I would ever
disband an organization...

355
01:13:50,394 --> 01:13:54,490
that took us so many years to build.

356
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:56,465
My Comrades...

357
01:13:56,534 --> 01:14:03,133
we stand fast together
for our Germany...

358
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:08,543
and we <i>must</i> stand fast together
for <i>this</i> Germany.

359
01:14:09,847 --> 01:14:13,476
And I hand to each of you
the new insignia...

360
01:14:13,551 --> 01:14:17,009
placing them with confidence...

361
01:14:17,088 --> 01:14:22,492
in the hands that I see as the most
trustworthy there are in Germany.

362
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:30,990
For in the past you have proven
your loyalty to me a thousand times.

363
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:38,236
In the time to come, it <i>cannot</i>
and <i>will not</i> be any different.

364
01:14:48,419 --> 01:14:56,690
And so I greet you as <i>my old,</i>
<i>faithful SA and SS men.!</i>

365
01:14:56,761 --> 01:14:59,093
<i>Hail Victory.! Hail.!</i>

<i>Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess</i>

419
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:53,633
The Führer speaks:

420
01:39:26,736 --> 01:39:33,005
The Sixth Party Day of the Movement
has come to and end.

421
01:39:33,076 --> 01:39:39,504
What appeared
like a show of political strength...

422
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:46,682
for millions of Germans
outside of our ranks.

423
01:39:46,756 --> 01:39:50,055
For hundreds of thousands
of fighters...

424
01:39:50,126 --> 01:39:53,357
it was ultimately more.

425
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:57,264
The great personal
and spiritual meeting...

426
01:39:57,334 --> 01:40:01,703
of the old fighters
and comrades in struggle.

427
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:04,296
And, perhaps, a cross section of you...

428
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:09,539
despite the forced civility
of this review of our Party...

429
01:40:09,613 --> 01:40:13,811
will return with courageous hearts

430
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:20,288
to the days in which it was difficult
to be a National Socialist.

431
01:40:26,796 --> 01:40:33,895
When our Party consisted
of only <i>seven</i> members...

432
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:36,063
it already had two principles.

433
01:40:36,139 --> 01:40:41,406
<i>First</i>, it would be a Party
with a true ideology.

434
01:40:41,478 --> 01:40:45,471
And <i>second</i>, it would be,
uncompromisingly...

435
01:40:45,548 --> 01:40:49,814
<i>the one and only power in Germany.</i>

436
01:41:00,997 --> 01:41:05,593
We had to remain in the minority,
because we mobilized...

437
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:12,598
the most valuable elements of struggle
and sacrifice in the Nation...

438
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:18,012
which have always been not in the
majority, but rather in the minority.

439
01:41:27,190 --> 01:41:33,959
And because these are the racially best
of the German nation...

440
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:36,658
they can in the proudest self-esteem...

441
01:41:36,733 --> 01:41:40,328
claim the leadership
of the Reich and the people.

442
01:41:40,403 --> 01:41:43,964
The German people...

443
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:48,136
and subordinated itself to
this leadership in ever-growing numbers!

444
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:02,157
The German people is happy...

445
01:42:02,225 --> 01:42:06,491
in the knowledge
that a constantly changing vision...

446
01:42:06,563 --> 01:42:12,331
has been replaced by a <i>fixed pole.!</i>

447
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:31,486
Whoever feels that he is the carrier
of the best blood...

448
01:42:31,554 --> 01:42:37,550
and knowingly uses it
to attain the leadership...

449
01:42:37,627 --> 01:42:43,259
will never relinquish it!

450
01:42:55,278 --> 01:42:57,644
<i>Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof</i>
<i>(Reich Bishop of the United</i>
<i>German Evangelist Church)</i>

451
01:42:57,714 --> 01:43:03,152
There is always a part of the people who
stand out as really active fighters...

452
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:10,819
and more is expected from them
than from the millions of national
comrades in the general population.

453
01:43:10,894 --> 01:43:17,231
For them it is not simply enough
to make the pledge: <i>"I believe.!"</i>

454
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:20,098
Rather, the affirmation: <i>"I fight.!"</i>

455
01:43:38,988 --> 01:43:46,690
For all time to come the Party will be
the source of political leadership
for the German people.

456
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:51,928
It will in its teaching...

457
01:43:52,001 --> 01:43:55,437
and was ultimately in its organization
hard as steel...

458
01:43:55,505 --> 01:43:58,941
malleable in its tactics
and adaptable in its entirety:

459
01:43:59,008 --> 01:44:03,342
yet it will be a training school
like a <i>holy order</i> for political leaders.

460
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:19,652
It must be shown, however,
that <i>all upstanding Germans</i>
<i>become Nationalist Socialists.</i>

461
01:44:19,729 --> 01:44:25,133
Only <i>the best Nationalist Socialists,</i>
<i>however, are Party Comrades.!</i>

462
01:44:45,722 --> 01:44:55,222
Once, our enemies worried us and
persecuted us and, from time to time...

463
01:44:55,298 --> 01:45:01,259
removed the lesser elements
from the Movement <i>for</i> us.

464
01:45:02,071 --> 01:45:09,375
<i>Today</i> we must examine ourselves
and remove from our midst
the elements that have become bad.

465
01:45:17,654 --> 01:45:21,112
<i>And therefore, do not belong with us.!</i>

466
01:45:27,664 --> 01:45:29,655
It is our wish and will...

467
01:45:29,732 --> 01:45:35,466
that this State and this Reich
last for thousand years.

468
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:43,604
<i>We can be happy to know</i>
<i>that this future belongs entirely to us.!</i>

469
01:45:57,193 --> 01:46:01,061
<i>When the older ones among us falter...</i>

470
01:46:01,130 --> 01:46:07,296
<i>the youth will stiffen</i>
<i>and remain until their bodies decay.</i>

471
01:46:26,923 --> 01:46:34,261
Only then, if we in the Party
with our most obedient dedication...

472
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:42,328
become the highest embodiment of
National Socialist thought and being...

473
01:46:42,405 --> 01:46:44,930
then the Party will materialize...

474
01:46:45,008 --> 01:46:51,140
into <i>an eternal and indestructible</i>
<i>pillar</i> of the German people and Reich.

475
01:46:51,214 --> 01:46:58,279
Then our <i>glorious</i>
and laudable Army...

476
01:46:58,354 --> 01:47:01,721
the old, proud,
standard bearers of our people...

477
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:04,851
who are equally tradition minded...

478
01:47:04,927 --> 01:47:07,623
will champion the Political Leadership
and the Party.

479
01:47:07,697 --> 01:47:13,795
And then these two institutions
will equally educate the German man...

480
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:17,465
and, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders...

481
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:20,634
<i>the German State, the German Reich.!</i>

482
01:47:33,756 --> 01:47:41,390
At this hour, tens of thousands
of our Party Comrades
are already leaving the City.

483
01:47:41,464 --> 01:47:46,163
While many of them relive
the meeting in their memories...

484
01:47:46,235 --> 01:47:51,172
still others are already planning
the next review.

485
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:59,614
And again the people come and go and
they will be engrossed anew and happy...

486
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:04,676
and inspired, for the idea and
the Movement live on in our people...

487
01:48:04,754 --> 01:48:08,019
and with the Movement
are symbol of eternity!

488
01:48:08,091 --> 01:48:10,855
<i>Long live</i>
<i>the National Socialist Movement.!</i>

489
01:48:10,927 --> 01:48:13,088
<i>Long live Germany.!</i>

490
01:48:36,119 --> 01:48:40,453
<i>Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess</i>
<i>at the Podium</i>

491
01:49:12,989 --> 01:49:16,925
<i>The Party is Hitler.!</i>

492
01:49:16,993 --> 01:49:21,157
<i>But Hitler is Germany,</i>
<i>as Germany is Hitler.!</i>

493
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:25,894
Hitler: Hail Victory!
Hail Victory!

494
01:49:27,069 --> 01:49:29,697
<i>"The Horst Wessel Song"</i>

495
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:32,707
the NSDAP hymn and unofficial
German National Anthem
after <i>Deutschland Über Alles.</i>
