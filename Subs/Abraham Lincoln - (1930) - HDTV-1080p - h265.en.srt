1
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,639
Tom Lincoln!
it's a comin'!

2
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,496
- Boy or gal?
- 'Taint fur enough along yit fer a tag.

3
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:54,903
- How's Nancy standin' it?
- She's a-prayin'.

4
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,300
it's a boy?

5
00:06:01,609 --> 00:06:03,008
it's as long as an eel!

6
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:13,487
Shucks, he' never
amount to nothin' nohow!

7
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,063
Is he purty?

8
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:19,731
Homely as a mud fence!

9
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:22,796
What do you 'low
to call him, Aunty?

10
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,527
Abraham.

11
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,619
There he is. Ugliest, laziest,
smartest man in New Salem.

12
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,624
- Ain't yuh, Abe?
- I don't mind my face, I'm behind it.

13
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:03,796
it's the people
in front that get jarred.

14
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,791
Whip any man in shoo
leather I At least, I hope he can.

15
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:11,500
Offut does the braggin',
I do the runnin'.

16
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,675
You better dust off
them shoes then, stranger,

17
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:15,241
'cause you ain't here for long.

18
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,488
Well, I was aimin'
to settle here awhile.

19
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,888
- This ain't no peaceable town.
- Well, I'm a peaceable man.

20
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:22,714
Wait till
Jack Armstrong gets hold o' yuh.

21
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,575
He'll throw yuh out
that door like yuh was a sack o' meal!

22
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,678
- Big fellow?
- No bigger'n you,

23
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:31,521
but he's champion o' this country
he ain' never been licked.

24
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:33,551
And when he sees you...

25
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,259
Folks can't even spit
without his sayso.

26
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,156
Chuck me outa that door, you say?

27
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,793
Like a sack o' meal.

28
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,450
Well, that's a pretty long
chuck for a peaceful man.

29
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:48,501
Whar be he?

30
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:51,085
Now, Armstrong,
cain't you leave us be?

31
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,413
Yuh just busted up
old man Simpson's place

32
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:56,015
and scattered
his new place all over the county.

33
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,956
Man, don't you ever rest?

34
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,831
Whare be he?
That yellow-livered baboon from lndianny!

35
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,722
I come from lndianny,
but not that part.

36
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:08,409
Well, get down!

37
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,917
Let's see what bones
I wants to crack first!

38
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,213
Get a good hold, Jack!

39
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,634
Come on,

40
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,065
This is the neatest
wrestle you've ever had.

41
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,253
Go to him, Champ!

42
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,346
- Get 'in, Jack!
- Abraham Lincoln!

43
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,975
- Let's get 'im, Abe come on!
- Get 'in, Jack!

44
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:37,879
- Get 'im, Jack!

45
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,396
I'll bet yuh ten dollars,
Offut, on the Champeen!

46
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,426
- Watch 'im, boy!
- Git 'im!

47
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,788
- Watch 'im, boy!
- Come on, git 'im!

48
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,953
- Come on, git 'im!
- Git 'im!

49
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,312
Watch 'im, boy!

50
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,390
Come on, git 'im!

51
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,284
Now, come on, all o' you.

52
00:09:12,443 --> 00:09:13,960
I'm the big tuck of thisn lick!

53
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,449
Yuh are, eh?

54
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:18,647
Hold on, boys!

55
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,488
He throwed me fair.

56
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,419
What's your name?

57
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:26,851
Lincoln,
Abraham Lincoln.

58
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,562
Well, we're goin' to make yuh one of us.

59
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,923
Come on, boys, I'll set 'em up!

60
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,487
it's about time you set 'em up.

61
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,583
Let's have some o'
that rattlesnake bite.

62
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,793
He said he was a peaceful man.

63
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:44,932
He meant peaceful like a wildcat!

64
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,415
Yeh, that's what he thought.

65
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:49,090
Looks like good corn liquor.

66
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,876
That is corn liquor.

67
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,691
Come on, Abe. Where's yours?

68
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,832
No, I don't care much for it.

69
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,737
Come on, have a drink, Abe.

70
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,478
Well, I'll drink
if you'll take it like I do.

71
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:02,964
How's that?

72
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,634
Lift up the barrel,
and drink it outa the bung.

73
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:08,797
Well, I'll show you boys.

74
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,295
Maybe can, maybe can't.
Try it, anyway.

75
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,647
Whew!

76
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:34,816
He's the strongest man in Salem!

77
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:36,870
I told you he was the strongest man.

78
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:39,617
I've seen him lift
500 pounds in each hand.

79
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:44,426
- Ain't yuh drinkin?
- No.

80
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,983
- Teetotal?
- No.

81
00:10:47,595 --> 00:10:48,809
Reformer?

82
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:51,550
No, I don't
regulate nobody's drinkin'

83
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:53,462
just my own.

84
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,091
I've seen him lift a thousand...

85
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,402
- In this sense,-
- the term "law"-

86
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:09,207
- includes any edict,-
- decree, order,-

87
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:14,962
- ordinance,-
- statute, resolution,-

88
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:18,184
- rule, etcetera.-

89
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,653
Â¡Uff! etcetera...

90
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:32,242
Well, my old Daddy
taught me how to work,

91
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,145
but he never
taught me how to like it.

92
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:40,060
I reckon I better
keep on with the lesson.

93
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,574
I'd rather keep on
with something else.

94
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:48,314
You made a bad bargain
making me the professor.

95
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,739
Well he told me about that too.

96
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,582
He said:
"When you make a bad bargain,

97
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:56,168
hug it all the tighter."

98
00:11:58,026 --> 00:12:00,753
But he didn't mean
this kind of a bargain.

99
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:05,828
Well, don't you like it,
Ann, when I hold you tight?

100
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,594
I guess every girl sorta likes that...

101
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,068
Now, Abe, what is law?

102
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:25,467
Well, professor, law is a rule
of human conduct governing

103
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:26,902
Whoa!

104
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:33,573
Abe, l'ain't payin' you no forty
cents a day to spark a pretty gal!

105
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,459
Well, Uncle Jimmie,
I don't charge nothing extra for it

106
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:37,774
just throw it in.

107
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:44,260
I'm expectin'
a sight of rails cut of you.

108
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,841
He's the best
rail-splitter in the country.

109
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,756
He'll be more than a rail-splitter.

110
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:52,636
How old are you, Uncle Jimmie?

111
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,144
Oh nearin' forty.

112
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:58,856
I'll get you out forty
more rails than you expected.

113
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:05,147
Giddap! Maybe you'd better
make it nearin' seventy!

114
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:20,341
Now, Abe,
your professor needs a seat

115
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,152
where's there's more law
and less temptation.

116
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,844
Oh, Abe! Ohhh!

117
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:34,635
Ohhhh!

118
00:13:35,624 --> 00:13:37,511
- Are you all right, Anne?
- I think so.

119
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,474
- Are you hurt?
- My legs are still on me.

120
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,098
Scared me worse than it did you.

121
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:46,875
Did it, Abe?

122
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:54,382
You know, Anne, if anything happened
to you, I don't think I could live.

123
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:59,036
Funny, Abe, I feel the same about you.

124
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,381
You taught me how to love.

125
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:05,973
Have I taught you to like it?

126
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:21,628
- In the gloaming, oh, my darling,-

127
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:29,783
- When the lights are dim and low,-

128
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:35,197
- And the quiet shadows falling.-

129
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:43,999
- Softly come and softly go.-

130
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:47,214
it's awful nice this time of day.

131
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,337
Yes, Abe.

132
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,873
Can I tell you
a sort of a story, Anne?

133
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,337
Why of course, Abe.

134
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:57,339
Well, there was
a town in lllinois called...

135
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,490
called...

136
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,582
- New Salem?
- Yeh, that's it.

137
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:05,599
And in that town lived
the prettiest girl in the world.

138
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:07,416
What was her name?

139
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:08,938
Anne Rutledge.

140
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:10,827
Oh, Abe...

141
00:15:13,374 --> 00:15:16,025
What I'd like
to find out about that girl is,

142
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:20,536
she ever take a little time off
to think about gettin' married?

143
00:15:21,144 --> 00:15:22,728
Well, maybe.

144
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,950
'Cause there's an Abe Lincoln
hanging around that's a pretty good catch.

145
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,808
What's he like?

146
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:32,922
Oh, he's a big merchant,
owner of three stores all bankrupt.

147
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, is he handsome?

148
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:41,185
His pa said that Abe
had been cut out with an axe.

149
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,350
Politician too, I hear.

150
00:15:44,188 --> 00:15:46,839
Yes, he's got less property
and owes more debts

151
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,992
than anybody
ever running for the legislature.

152
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,750
Oh, Abe, you'll do all
right when you get started.

153
00:15:57,113 --> 00:16:01,122
There's something I'd like to start
right now if I thought I could finish it.

154
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,048
You know, Anne, l...

155
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,617
I've always done a lot of dreamin'

156
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,956
and lately it seems when I dream,

157
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,292
your face gets mixed up in it.

158
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:20,490
Does it really, Abe?
Tell me about the mixin'.

159
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:27,203
I feel as though I'm going to be
seeing your face till the day I die.

160
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:35,158
'Course I know that would be pretty hard
for you to have to look at my face that long.

161
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:38,113
Everybody to their own opinion

162
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:41,798
Meaning?

163
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:45,507
I think...

164
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,492
it's the dearest, kindest,
most beautiful face in the whole world!

165
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:55,702
Oh, Anne...
Anne...

166
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,865
I know
that's just flattery but I love it.

167
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:07,527
You know
I feel like little Jimmie Watkins,

168
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,761
he got a hunk of gingerbread
the other day and says:

169
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:12,953
"l guess there's nobody
likes ginger bread like I does and

170
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,284
gets so little of it".

171
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,481
Oh, Abe!

172
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,196
Anne, will you...

173
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,666
will you marry me?

174
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:27,508
I mean, of course when l...

175
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:30,313
when l...
get out of debt and can support you?

176
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:36,452
Well, you know, Abe,
I've intended to for a long while

177
00:17:38,046 --> 00:17:41,603
that is, of course, if you asked me.

178
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:46,298
You... you mean?

179
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:51,420
Yes, Abe, you've got your gingerbread.

180
00:17:53,435 --> 00:17:54,987
Oh, Anne!

181
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:09,764
- Will you think of me and love me-

182
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:20,793
- As you did once long ago?-

183
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,564
Pretty bad.

184
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:32,608
She's been asking for you, Abe.

185
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:34,272
I came as soon as I could.

186
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,619
I had the fever pretty bad myself.

187
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,885
I've got to tell you the truth, Abe,

188
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,191
it's hopeless...

189
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:53,671
perhaps by tomorrow...

190
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,651
no longer.

191
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:25,991
I'm so glad you came, Abe.

192
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:29,846
Are you all right now?

193
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,549
Now, don't bother about me, dear.
I'm all right now.

194
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:41,332
I know the truth, dear.
it's good-bye.

195
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:45,613
No, no, Anne dear,
you're not going to leave me!

196
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:47,455
I won't let you!

197
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:51,657
We must be brave, dear...

198
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:59,372
Don't take me away!
Don't take me away!

199
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:06,021
it's so dark and lonesome going!

200
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,781
Anne, you mustn't let go!

201
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:16,232
if they'd sing,
I wouldn't be so afraid.

202
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:24,805
- In the sweet by and by,-

203
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,516
- We shall meet on that beautiful shore.-

204
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,607
We will meet there, dear.

205
00:20:35,514 --> 00:20:37,363
Oh... I love you so!

206
00:20:38,878 --> 00:20:41,748
I love you so!

207
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:19,171
Feeling any better, Bowling?

208
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,173
No, not much.

209
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,576
I'll tell you, Doctor,
he's just like a sick child...

210
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:27,600
He was lost for five days
before we found him.

211
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,044
Yeh, I know.

212
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:33,796
We took his pocket-knife away from him,
we were so afeard something might happen.

213
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:38,417
Good gracious,
Abe, you're looking better!

214
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,265
No use trying to talk to him,

215
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,350
he just cain't answer.

216
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:16,258
if we could only think of something
that would just bring him back.

217
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:20,982
I guess time's the only thing.

218
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:28,536
Why should the spirit of mortal be proud,

219
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:33,794
like a swift-fleeting meteor,
fast-flying cloud?

220
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:38,855
Flash of the lightning,
break of the wave,

221
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,346
He passes from life
to his rest in the grave.

222
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,348
My goodness, Mary Todd, just think!

223
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:33,697
He'll be here in a few minutes
the catch of America!

224
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,948
Stephen A. Douglas!

225
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,802
Just think of being his wife!

226
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,517
Don't be in such a hurry, sister.

227
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:43,295
I'm not even engaged
much less married.

228
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:45,578
But if he should propose?

229
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:49,345
How do I know he's going further
than anyone else in Springfield?

230
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:53,486
When I pick a husband, sister,
I'll pick a man!

231
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:55,357
But I don't know
what you're talking about.

232
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,623
A lot of people seem to think
a man named Abraham Lincoln

233
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,860
is going even further than Mr. Douglas.

234
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,488
Why, Mary Todd, have you gone crazy?

235
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:08,746
You compare an unknown cornfield lawyer

236
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:12,361
with a brilliant cultured gentleman
like Stephen A. Douglas!

237
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,228
Why, if you just saw
the two of them together.

238
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:15,683
Oh, he's here!

239
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:18,607
Mr. Douglas is down in the parlor
and he's asking for Mary!

240
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,459
Now, Mary, you must be
very careful, and remember

241
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:23,363
he doesn't like to have girls too bold.

242
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:26,559
Don't get so excited,
sister, and don't hurry me.

243
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,925
I'll take care of myself.

244
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:59,218
You glide through the dance
like grace itself Miss Todd.

245
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:02,036
Always the politician, Mr. Douglas!

246
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:09,299
Who wouldn't be a politician
with so fair a constituent to win?

247
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,982
- Exquisite!
- The fan, Mr. Douglas?

248
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:56,296
No, the fair owner herself.

249
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:02,884
- May I look?
- Sr. Douglas...

250
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,855
I wonder if you'd do me a great favor?

251
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,719
Yes.

252
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:10,612
Then, pray present me
to this young lady.

253
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:13,616
- Miss Todd?
- Yes?

254
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,416
May I present one
of the leading lawyers of Springfield

255
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,031
Mr. Abraham Lincoln?

256
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,588
Mr. Lincoln!

257
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:30,699
Miss Todd I wonder
if you'd honor me with the next dance?

258
00:28:31,655 --> 00:28:34,427
Why, why...

259
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,466
I'd be delighted.

260
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,824
Miss Todd, you thought my face was funny,

261
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:46,503
and the way I dressed even funnier,

262
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:47,952
but the joke's on you.

263
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,698
Why, I don't understand.

264
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:53,249
Wait till you dance with me.

265
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:23,796
Have you got the license, Mr. Lincoln?

266
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,253
Well, she got you.

267
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,071
I knew she would
when she started out the first time for you.

268
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,519
Now, Billie, don't bother me.

269
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,582
I'm going to be married
and I'm scared to death.

270
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:43,827
Oh, don't be alarmed.

271
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:45,964
There's many a bite
that's worse than a bride's.

272
00:29:46,653 --> 00:29:49,728
But, Billie,
that woman scares me.

273
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:56,817
She's even got the ridiculous idea
that I could get to be president.

274
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,837
Oh, don't take that seriously.

275
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:01,848
Every spunky girl thinks
that her husband ought to be president.

276
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:04,169
I know, Billie,
but it's a pity to fool her.

277
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:05,996
And she's a fine woman,

278
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,316
smart as pepper and pretty too.

279
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:10,190
She'll be a great help to you, Mr. Lincoln,

280
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,316
but you've got to keep
climbing with her.

281
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,948
Yes... yes, I know.

282
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:17,958
I've got the best supper
you've ever tasted

283
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,812
and the cake...

284
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:22,717
wait till you see that cake!

285
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,700
What can have happened
to Mr. Lincoln? it's long after the...

286
00:30:24,818 --> 00:30:26,789
He would be late at his own wedding.

287
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:28,921
Now, never mind, Mary,

288
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,440
if he doesn't come soon,
I'll send John after him.

289
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,114
But he's hours late already!

290
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:34,557
Think of that!

291
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:37,034
Sister, calm yourself.

292
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:40,960
For heaven's sakes,
you've got to hurry!

293
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:46,371
Billie, you... you go ahead.
You go on over and I'll come later.

294
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:50,558
I doubt if there's a word in the
dictionary that could tell how I feel!

295
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:54,717
Billie, what does a man do
if his head's all right

296
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:56,317
but his legs are cowardly?

297
00:30:56,432 --> 00:30:57,796
My cure is to get drunk.

298
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:01,458
My legs are too frightened
to pay any attention to liquor.

299
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,585
I'll go ahead and
tell them that you're coming.

300
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:17,413
Anne!

301
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:23,503
Anne!

302
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,759
Anne!

303
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:36,539
We looked, everywhere,
tort we can't find him.

304
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:38,900
No, can't find him...
not at the office.

305
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,502
What on earth happened to him?

306
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:42,511
He was in a terrible
state when I left him.

307
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:45,821
He was so frightened and upset.
I imagine he just ran away.

308
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:50,162
Ran away... from me!
On our weddin' day!

309
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,495
Now sistern dear...

310
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:52,789
Don't 'sister' me!

311
00:31:52,948 --> 00:31:57,775
Can you imagine! That's what a Todd gets
for engagin' herself to a country baboon!

312
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,401
- Listen, dear, you mustn't...
- You may as well all go home!

313
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:02,953
You hear me?
You may as well all go home!

314
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:04,429
Not goin' to be any weddin' here.

315
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,113
You can all go home
as far as I'm concerned!

316
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,196
But this is so distressing!

317
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:15,854
You certainly are a matchmaker

318
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,973
to reconcile those two after
what happened two years ago.

319
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:20,689
We all like Mr. Lincoln,

320
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,388
and Mary is just
the girl to push him along.

321
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:27,117
Oh, Mary, how sweet you look!

322
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,450
What a lovely dress!

323
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:30,767
Yes, and so becoming to her too.

324
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:32,906
Maybe that's Mr. Lincoln now.

325
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:36,856
Julia it all seems so strange
having things end this way.

326
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:40,250
it's just as it should end. You and
Mr. Lincoln will make a great man.

327
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,973
- Good morning, Mr. Lincoln.

328
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:45,651
Good morning.

329
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:51,175
Come, my dear
we'll leave the happy pair alone.

330
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,572
Good morning, Mary.

331
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,240
l, l...

332
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,122
Mary, you don't have
to bother about me any more.

333
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,412
I think I've settled down at last.

334
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:12,365
I hope I can make
your future all you desire.

335
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,842
We'll say no more about it, Mr. Lincoln.

336
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,949
I really think, after all, you need me.

337
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:24,665
You'll need a lot of patience
to put up with me, Mary,

338
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:29,222
but if anyone can do it,
I'm sure you're the one.

339
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:34,435
Oh, Mary!

340
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,363
Douglas is a prize speaker,

341
00:34:10,563 --> 00:34:14,060
but just wait till old Abe
gets a hold of him on slavery!

342
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,580
You're crazy!

343
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,424
Lincoln has no more chance of beating
Douglas for Senate than I have.

344
00:34:20,229 --> 00:34:22,166
He only went to school for three months.

345
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,688
There must be no issue of slavery.

346
00:34:46,344 --> 00:34:49,038
We must face the facts.

347
00:34:54,479 --> 00:35:00,179
I'll run Mr. Lincoln out of this campaign.

348
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,636
I will not throw mud.

349
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:21,692
Let each State mind its own business
and this Republic can exist forever...

350
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,745
divided into free and slave states.

351
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:43,286
We will not allow
the extension of slavery to any State.

352
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:49,706
We will not allow
the secession of any State.

353
00:35:52,298 --> 00:35:59,553
Above all and before all,
the Union must be preserved.

354
00:36:05,108 --> 00:36:09,552
A house divided
against itself must fall!

355
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:22,057
âDouglas elected!-
âHurrah for Douglas!-

356
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:25,858
âDouglas elected!-
âHurrah for Douglas!-

357
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:33,380
âDouglas elected!-
âHurrah for Douglas!-

358
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,129
Mary...

359
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,680
I'm home, Mary.

360
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:06,072
You must be tired, Mr. Lincoln.

361
00:37:08,438 --> 00:37:09,573
Sit down.

362
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,623
You just ait right here.
I'll get your supper for you in a minute.

363
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:41,656
Billy, I feel like
the little boy who stubbed his toe.

364
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:44,472
It hurt too bad to laugh,
and he was too big to cry.

365
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:49,714
I'm fifty years old, Billy,
and a failure in everything.

366
00:37:50,595 --> 00:37:53,134
if I died today,
nobody'd ever know I'd lived.

367
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:56,442
Come in.

368
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:03,512
Mr. Lincoln,
I want you to meet Mr. Pell

369
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:06,975
one of the most important
men in Eastern politics.

370
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,317
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Pell.
- I'm honored, indeed, Mr. Lincoln.

371
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:12,940
- Meet my partner, Mr. Herndon.
- How do you do, Mr. Herndon?

372
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,152
Happy to meet you, sir.

373
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,401
- Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.

374
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:21,339
Mr. Lincoln, your campaign against
Douglas has made you a national figure.

375
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:25,945
I'm here to ask you if you will consider
being the Republican party's candidate

376
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:27,808
for the presidency.

377
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:37,269
Did you say a failure in everything?

378
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,349
- A telegram for you, Mr. Fell.
- Oh thank you.

379
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:53,121
Mr. Lincoln, you know
ever since John Brown's raid,

380
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:57,000
the South has been infuriated,
the East on the verge of revolt,

381
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:59,356
and now New York
threatens to quit the Union.

382
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:01,252
No, no New York mustn't do that.

383
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:05,209
We must keep the front door on the hinge.
There can be no secession.

384
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:09,695
The Union must be preserved.

385
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:15,059
The crisis is at hand, Mr. Lincoln,
and we believe you are the man.

386
00:39:20,116 --> 00:39:24,180
Gentlemen,
I feel deeply grateful.

387
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,079
Paw, Maw says if you don't come on home,
you won't get no supper.

388
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:34,631
"l have another crisis; the soup and
the country are boiling over together!"

389
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:36,459
Maw's boiling too!

390
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:42,159
It needs deep consideration.

391
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:46,600
Well, Mr. Lincoln,
mayn't we meet you at our hotel later?

392
00:39:49,196 --> 00:39:51,205
- I'll be there within the hour?
- Thank you.

393
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:54,357
Come on, Paw, we're hungry.

394
00:40:12,907 --> 00:40:15,829
They've started it.
This is gonna mean war!

395
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,619
This darkio saw it himself.

396
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:22,115
Brown and a gang of Abolitionists
have captured the armory at Harper's Ferry!

397
00:40:22,612 --> 00:40:25,426
They're arming the slaves
to rise up and murder us all.

398
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:28,091
They gived us all rifles.

399
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:29,457
And what'd you do with yours?

400
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:35,356
What'd I do? I trowed it down,
and I say, 'Feet, you travel'.

401
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:38,403
- They can't invade Virginia.
- No!

402
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:41,032
Boys, go home and git your guns.

403
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:42,358
What's all this talk about guns?

404
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:44,073
This thing has gone far enough.

405
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:46,886
We'll be murdered
in our beds by our own slaves.

406
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:50,162
Pardon me, ladies,
while I find out about this desecration.

407
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,553
- John Brown, eh?
- Abolitionists!

408
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:53,845
- it's an outrage!

409
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:55,789
Outrage isn't the word.

410
00:40:56,825 --> 00:41:02,909
I'll shoot on sight every Abolitionist
who dares defile the soil of old Virginia.

411
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:06,257
- Who's he?
- That's the actor, John Wilkes Booth.

412
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:08,613
He can't act
but the women don't know it.

413
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:13,030
All right, men, get your guns
and we'll meet at the square!

414
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:16,720
At the square!

415
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:50,521
Can't say much for her disposition!

416
00:41:50,752 --> 00:41:52,040
Hush! She may hear you.

417
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:54,472
Soldiers, indeed!
They can't even carry trunks.

418
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,832
Here you no, the stupid-looking one

419
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:59,847
put that over there...
and you... idiot

420
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,317
don't look at me like
a duck in a thunderstorm!

421
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,662
Hurry... hurry!
Will you put them in there?

422
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:08,103
I never saw such a lot of incompetents.

423
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,879
And as for you with the whiskers,
I told you to put it in there.

424
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:14,156
Oh, is it going to take forever?

425
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:19,477
Thank heavens, that's the last!

426
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:21,688
imbeciles!

427
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,862
Well, Mary, we're here.

428
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:27,695
Thanks to me! if it wasn't for my advice,
you'd be out in Oregon, chopping trees.

429
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:30,208
Yes, you're always right, Mary.

430
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:38,585
I've found out one thing, Lincoln.

431
00:42:39,543 --> 00:42:41,815
Servants here are no better
than they are in Springfield.

432
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,881
This place
hasn't been cleaned in a year.

433
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:51,673
Why, Mr. President!

434
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:55,934
Huh?

435
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,801
Then we agree that the situation
of our country is ominous.

436
00:43:05,954 --> 00:43:07,772
- Most alarming.
- Certainly.

437
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:11,386
We agree that we must yield
to the demands of the South

438
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:14,896
and evacuate Fort Sumter.

439
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,514
- Absolutely.
- it's the only solution.

440
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:19,006
- That must be done.

441
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:23,261
We agree that our President
must be firmly guided by us.

442
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:30,113
That we must make every effort
to control his inexperienced judgment.

443
00:43:30,882 --> 00:43:33,998
- We certainly must.
- Yes.

444
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,733
Gentlemen...

445
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:42,713
- Mr. President.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

446
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,082
Thank you, Hay.

447
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,281
Thank you, gentlemen...

448
00:44:23,548 --> 00:44:31,467
I will shoulder all responsibilities.
The relief shall go to Fort Sumter.

449
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:34,617
That means war.

450
00:44:35,655 --> 00:44:39,572
Mr. Seward, I am a man of peace,

451
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,945
but the Union shall be preserved.

452
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,164
Seventy-five thousand...

453
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,708
It might be difficult
to get that many volunteers.

454
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:26,518
Mr. President, the people demand a victory,
and we've got to take Richmond.

455
00:48:34,756 --> 00:48:38,137
The country is discouraged.
We must do something.

456
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:41,162
That reminds me of a story...

457
00:48:41,645 --> 00:48:44,322
about a man building
a boat to cross a river.

458
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:48,092
He got impatient
building the boat and started swimming.

459
00:48:49,714 --> 00:48:51,204
Well, sir, what happened?

460
00:48:52,313 --> 00:48:53,488
He drowned.

461
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,088
We've got to be careful
not to drown this country.

462
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,222
Ready here!
Ready here!

463
00:49:11,563 --> 00:49:12,816
- Quartermaster General.
- Yes, sir.

464
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,397
Ready here!
Ready here!

465
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,426
- Ready here!
- Sergeant, I'm going out.

466
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:23,994
- How did you make out?
- Make out?

467
00:49:24,317 --> 00:49:25,728
He darned near kissed me.

468
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:27,386
- Who?
- The Secretary of War.

469
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:30,568
We're just licking
the tar out of thorn all along the line.

470
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,382
- Who's next?
- I am.

471
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:35,337
I hope it's for the President.
I'd like to sec his face

472
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:36,750
when he gets the good news.

473
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:40,328
Ready here! Commissary.

474
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:43,716
For General Scott.
Marked private.

475
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:45,208
Rush it it's victory!

476
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,108
General Scott, what news?

477
00:49:57,419 --> 00:49:59,467
We're winning, sir. I'm sure of it.

478
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:03,353
- I wish...
- Come in.

479
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:13,833
- Rebel resistance broken at Bull Run,-

480
00:50:14,298 --> 00:50:17,571
- our army sweeping everything before it.-

481
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:23,207
President, if we can
capture Richmond now,

482
00:50:23,442 --> 00:50:25,262
it means the end of the war.

483
00:50:25,424 --> 00:50:28,045
- Ah, thank God.
- And you, sir...

484
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:32,049
this victory will silence
your enemies forever

485
00:50:32,548 --> 00:50:35,896
and you will be
the greatest president in our history.

486
00:50:36,054 --> 00:50:39,174
It doesn't matter
what they think of me, General.

487
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:42,104
- We will have saved the Union.
- Yes.

488
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:48,468
General, would you mind
letting me have that telegram?

489
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:50,522
I'd like to show it
to Mrs. Lincoln myself.

490
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:52,997
Why, certainly, not, Mr. President.

491
00:50:53,922 --> 00:50:57,347
And would you mind
not calling me 'Mr. President'...

492
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,631
just Lincoln.

493
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,681
All right, Lincoln.

494
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,009
Ready here!
Headquarters!

495
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:14,546
Sergeant, all messages
for General Scott, hold.

496
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,286
All messages for General Scott hold.

497
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:18,401
All messages for General Scott hold.

498
00:51:18,673 --> 00:51:20,972
Attention! Commanding officer.

499
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,441
At ease!

500
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:27,751
Ready here!

501
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:31,134
Bad news?
Give it to me.

502
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:40,027
Attention the President!

503
00:51:40,803 --> 00:51:41,953
At ease!

504
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,529
Well, General, what news now?

505
00:51:46,462 --> 00:51:48,148
And the first reports?

506
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:51,958
Over-confidence.

507
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:56,806
Yes, I should have known.

508
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:09,935
- impossible to reform lines.-

509
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,857
- The men are a confused mob,-

510
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:15,095
- entirely demoralized.-

511
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:19,408
You must make every effort
to save Washington.

512
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,602
- 1!
- 2!

513
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:37,993
- 3!
- 4!

514
00:52:38,076 --> 00:52:39,104
- 1!
- 2!

515
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:40,379
- 3!
- 4!

516
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:41,608
- 1!
- 2!

517
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:42,882
- 3!
- 4!

518
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,261
- 1!
- 2!

519
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,921
Battalion!

520
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:47,768
On right into line, March!

521
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:49,193
Company, halt!

522
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:50,696
Left turn!

523
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:53,740
Right turn!

524
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,236
Halt!

525
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,589
First Company, right by fours.

526
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,552
Well, they're gathering.

527
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,414
The reserves are gathering, sir.

528
00:53:43,696 --> 00:53:46,093
- How many regulars can we muster?
- About five thousand.

529
00:53:47,122 --> 00:53:48,891
- Volunteers?
- Doubtful, sir.

530
00:53:49,288 --> 00:53:50,933
Can we hold Washington?

531
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:52,511
We'll do our best sir.

532
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,849
Mr. Hay, is it true
we have to get out of Washington?

533
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:03,143
It is very serious, madam.

534
00:54:03,385 --> 00:54:05,904
For heaven's sake,
what sort of an army have we anyhow?

535
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:07,670
They did the best
they could, Mrs. Lincoln.

536
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:09,166
They might have considered us.

537
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:11,218
it'll take forever
to get those trunks packed.

538
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:14,054
I'm sorry, madam, for all of us.

539
00:54:19,452 --> 00:54:22,162
Mr. Lincoln, I hear we're leaving.

540
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,999
Just a moment, Mary, please.

541
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:27,828
After all the trouble we had getting here,

542
00:54:28,115 --> 00:54:31,027
I must say we've had a very short stay.

543
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,458
Mary, I've hung up my hat right here,

544
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:39,492
and here it stays till
they knock it off with a bayonet.

545
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:46,384
From now on, Mary,
I'm going to run this war.

546
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,759
March! Halt!

547
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,725
Headquarters,
Post Number Four.

548
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:02,119
Halt! Guard.

549
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,133
Forward March!

550
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:14,308
Counsel of the accused,

551
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,184
have you nothing further
to say in defense of the prisoner?

552
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:22,533
The court finds you guilty
and the sentence death.

553
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,952
- Just a minute.
- The President... attention!

554
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:40,972
You must pardon me,
gentlemen, for this intrusion.

555
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:46,463
I overheard one of our soldiers
sentenced to death.

556
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:50,585
Yes, Mr. President.
A bad example of cowardice and desertion.

557
00:55:53,154 --> 00:55:56,867
Well, young man, tell me about it.

558
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,153
I think the findings
of the court were just, sir.

559
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,163
That all you have to say?

560
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:09,899
Sire, it was our first big battle.

561
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,796
We were trying to take a stone wall.

562
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:15,794
We'd been trying,
it seems, for years...

563
00:56:15,963 --> 00:56:17,178
Go on.

564
00:56:17,822 --> 00:56:20,355
Finally, though, we got there.

565
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:24,069
I was fighting bayonets.

566
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:26,407
We were all crazy...

567
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:28,500
on top of the wall...

568
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,513
Yes?

569
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:35,895
There was my boyhood chum,
looking up at me from the ground.

570
00:56:37,409 --> 00:56:43,531
Not alive,
we had killed him a long time ago,

571
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:45,307
but I knew him.

572
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,773
And then?

573
00:56:47,729 --> 00:56:50,736
I guess I went really crazy, sir.

574
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:54,370
That's all.

575
00:56:54,618 --> 00:56:56,904
The captain reports
that you threw your rifle away.

576
00:56:57,549 --> 00:57:00,317
Yes, sir. That must be right, sir.

577
00:57:00,913 --> 00:57:02,692
Making excuses, Colton?

578
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:04,351
No, sir only...

579
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:06,806
get it over with, quick!

580
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:15,401
Hanging, killing, blood.

581
00:57:26,473 --> 00:57:27,734
I'm tired.

582
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:35,538
But my generals are right,
we must maintain discipline.

583
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:37,206
That's all.

584
00:57:40,745 --> 00:57:41,963
Wait a minute.

585
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,896
Bring that young man back.

586
00:57:49,073 --> 00:57:50,255
I have it!

587
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:54,342
- it's a leg case.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

588
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,994
Leg case... yes, yes,

589
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,314
my shelves are full of them,
but not quite like this one.

590
00:58:03,543 --> 00:58:07,062
if the Lord Almighty
gives a man a cowardly pair of legs,

591
00:58:07,587 --> 00:58:08,929
and that man gets frightened,

592
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:13,094
he can't help his legs
running away with him, can he?

593
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:19,910
Young man, I'm going to pardon you.

594
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,408
Go back and do your duty.

595
00:58:25,606 --> 00:58:28,890
Oh, I will, sir! I will!

596
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:31,473
I'm trusting you.

597
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,854
Well, Senator?

598
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:44,006
Mr. President, my state of New York

599
00:58:44,255 --> 00:58:46,829
is crying out
against this endless slaughter.

600
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:48,454
- And mine, sir.

601
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:56,306
They're holding services here today
for those who were sacrificed,

602
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,091
as they are everywhere.

603
00:58:58,574 --> 00:59:00,706
- From the East to the West, sir.

604
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:02,267
- It can't go on, sir.

605
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,588
New England, the West,

606
00:59:07,148 --> 00:59:12,231
the entire country are in mourning
for this useless waste of lives.

607
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:18,216
Let the Southern States
go there way, Mr. President,

608
00:59:18,819 --> 00:59:19,879
and we will go ours.

609
00:59:20,128 --> 00:59:21,833
But I tell you, Mr. President...

610
00:59:22,152 --> 00:59:25,720
- ... out of the wilderness,-
- out of the wilderness.-

611
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,889
- Old Abe Lincoln-
- came out of the wilderness,-

612
00:59:30,129 --> 00:59:33,020
- down in lllinois.-

613
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:36,049
Daddy, mother won't let me stay up.

614
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:38,668
She wants me to go to bed,
and I don't want to.

615
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:42,153
Don't you think it's time
for little boys to be in bed, Tad?

616
00:59:42,602 --> 00:59:45,619
- But I want to stay with you.
- But your mother?

617
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,830
if you say so, she can't make me.

618
00:59:49,038 --> 00:59:50,432
You're the President.

619
00:59:51,742 --> 00:59:56,545
You're the only person in the country
who thinks I should have any authority.

620
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,457
- Run along now.
- No.

621
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:06,711
I want to stay with you.
Please, can't l, daddy?

622
01:00:07,074 --> 01:00:11,169
No, we're very busy here now, Tad.
Run along.

623
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:13,076
All right, daddy.

624
01:00:17,173 --> 01:00:18,836
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

625
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:21,388
Sleep tight.

626
01:00:21,745 --> 01:00:22,892
Goodnight...

627
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,536
Gentlemen,
don't you suppose my heart bleeds

628
01:00:32,736 --> 01:00:35,678
for all the sorrows
this war has brought upon us?

629
01:00:36,914 --> 01:00:41,360
Do you suppose there is a human being
who wants peace more than I do.

630
01:00:42,842 --> 01:00:45,141
But we want lasting peace,

631
01:00:46,782 --> 01:00:50,674
and we can have that only
by preserving the Union.

632
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:01,417
And, gentlemen...

633
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:05,359
the Union is going to be preserved!

634
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:33,924
- And by virtue of the power,-
- and for the purpose aforesaid,-

635
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:38,691
- I do order and declare-
- that all persons held as slaves -

636
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:42,424
- within said designated states-
- and parts of states-

637
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,348
- are henceforward-
- and forever shall be... -

638
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:47,976
- free.-

639
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:09,044
Well, gentlemen, it is done.

640
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,525
- More bad news, Hay?
- I'm afraid there is.

641
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:30,736
Well, let's have it.

642
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:32,986
The Secret Service
reports that there are 600,000

643
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:36,944
- To get me?
- Yes.

644
01:03:38,051 --> 01:03:39,715
That many ought
to keep me dodging.

645
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:41,997
We're taking
every precaution to guard you.

646
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:44,928
Where are they mostly?

647
01:03:45,732 --> 01:03:49,303
Ohio has one 100,000 armed men
ready to rise up and depose you.

648
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,468
Illionois, 135,000.

649
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:56,151
lllinois,
my old stamping ground...

650
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:02,879
That makes me feel badly.
You mustn't tell Mary.

651
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,038
But Mr. President,
we are worried about you.

652
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:11,131
Don't mind me, Hay.
Go on to bed, you're tired.

653
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,346
Lincoln, come on to bed.

654
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:42,938
I'm worried, Mary.

655
01:04:43,852 --> 01:04:47,649
You can't win this war worrying and
walking around in your stocking feet.

656
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:49,709
I can't sleep.

657
01:04:50,509 --> 01:04:55,558
Neither can l. At least we could sleep
in Springfield, couldn't we?

658
01:04:57,127 --> 01:05:00,199
Did we ever sleep?

659
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:22,755
Now, stand still.

660
01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:29,338
I've got it, Mary.

661
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:34,702
I've found the man to win this war

662
01:05:36,796 --> 01:05:40,292
and his name is Grant.

663
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:54,134
I'm sorry, Mr. President, but smoking
is one of my most persistent habits.

664
01:05:55,356 --> 01:05:57,553
And winning victories is another.

665
01:05:59,012 --> 01:06:00,177
Thank you.

666
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:05,314
Then you do believe in me, Sir?

667
01:06:06,273 --> 01:06:07,710
I sent for you.

668
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:15,248
General, the North is desperate.

669
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,792
We need you.

670
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,009
And, should I assume command,
there will be no interference?

671
01:06:29,134 --> 01:06:31,521
None. I promise you that.

672
01:06:33,545 --> 01:06:34,714
Grant,

673
01:06:35,636 --> 01:06:38,221
Lieutenant-General is
the highest army command

674
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,081
the President can bestow.

675
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:44,192
We haven't had one
since General Washington.

676
01:06:45,982 --> 01:06:48,493
He was a fair sort of a soldier too.

677
01:06:50,356 --> 01:06:51,991
Lieutenant-General Grant,

678
01:06:53,247 --> 01:06:55,486
my orders are: Win the War.

679
01:06:57,585 --> 01:07:00,277
I'll give my best, Mr. President.

680
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:02,559
I know you will.

681
01:07:04,696 --> 01:07:07,889
Unfortunately many of us
have failed to recognize

682
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:11,309
a great Confederate Soldier.

683
01:07:12,001 --> 01:07:13,404
Lee.

684
01:07:14,966 --> 01:07:17,357
On the other hand, we have thus far

685
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:21,844
failed to take advantage
of a great Northern Soldier.

686
01:07:21,965 --> 01:07:24,776
I hope I am not too late
in correcting the error.

687
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:30,969
Mr. President,
I think it only fair to warn you

688
01:07:31,968 --> 01:07:34,056
that many people, don't approve of me.

689
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:35,613
Nor of me.

690
01:07:37,105 --> 01:07:41,579
But rest assured
there will be no interference,

691
01:07:43,835 --> 01:07:45,350
no intrusion.

692
01:07:47,183 --> 01:07:50,027
Well, of all things!
Who locked this door?

693
01:07:51,065 --> 01:07:52,273
My wife!

694
01:07:53,497 --> 01:07:54,826
All right, Mary.

695
01:08:00,684 --> 01:08:03,528
Land sakes!
Where did all the smoke come from?

696
01:08:03,688 --> 01:08:07,530
Mary, meet General Grant. Mrs. Lincoln.

697
01:08:08,176 --> 01:08:12,093
- it's a pleasure to meet the first lady.
- Thank you.

698
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:14,491
- I want to talk to you. Mr. Lincoln.
- But Mary, we...

699
01:08:14,646 --> 01:08:17,717
I want to talk to you about discharging
some of the servants in this house.

700
01:08:18,447 --> 01:08:21,747
I don't see how anybody
could talk in here with all this smoke.

701
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,907
Why don't you open the window?

702
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,411
I can't stand it!

703
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:29,361
Pardon me, General.

704
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:31,757
I'll have to talk to you later.

705
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:37,800
- I'm very sorry if...
- There no apologies, General.

706
01:08:39,062 --> 01:08:40,695
You've given me an idea.

707
01:08:42,258 --> 01:08:44,194
I may take up smoking myself.

708
01:08:48,422 --> 01:08:50,053
But to resume, General.

709
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,582
We will give you
all the help you need.

710
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:57,616
Every man capable
of bearing arms shall go.

711
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,232
We've got to win this war.

712
01:09:02,796 --> 01:09:06,291
It is a duty we owe
the South as well as the North.

713
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:11,963
it's a big job, Mr. President...
a big job.

714
01:09:12,536 --> 01:09:14,770
but thy will be done.

715
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:21,656
Thy will be done.

716
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:29,419
We're in a tight place now.

717
01:09:29,876 --> 01:09:31,773
Yes, we generally are, Stanton.

718
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:34,442
Everything depends upon Sheridan.

719
01:09:34,823 --> 01:09:36,304
He's a fighting Irishman.

720
01:09:36,459 --> 01:09:38,093
Then why doesn't he fight?

721
01:09:44,673 --> 01:09:47,897
- One division Sheridan's-
- army routed.-

722
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:51,965
- Now trying to hold left flank.-

723
01:09:54,754 --> 01:09:58,442
Oh, the blood it takes
to hold this Union together.

724
01:09:58,822 --> 01:10:04,371
It will undo everything
Grant has done. It's hopeless.

725
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,194
I don't think so...

726
01:10:07,343 --> 01:10:11,368
Before each victory I've had
a vision of a ship with white sails.

727
01:10:13,618 --> 01:10:15,631
That vision has just conic to me.

728
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:20,496
With all respect,
I'd rather trade your ship

729
01:10:20,919 --> 01:10:22,932
for good news from Sheridan.

730
01:10:27,961 --> 01:10:29,818
Is that General Sheridan in there?

731
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,216
Sure 'tis General Sheridan.

732
01:10:45,301 --> 01:10:46,967
Doesn't that sound like cannon fire?

733
01:10:49,903 --> 01:10:51,613
- I don't hear anything, sir.

734
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:13,137
Hey, come here.

735
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,985
Have you good ears?

736
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:18,543
Pretty good when they're washed.

737
01:11:19,611 --> 01:11:20,746
Then try them.

738
01:11:21,665 --> 01:11:23,332
Do you hear anything like cannon fire?

739
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:32,008
it's cannon all right,
over by the swamp.

740
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:34,022
They may have caught
General Wright by surprise!

741
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,991
Mount those horses!

742
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:52,279
- Sheridan's entire army-
- has met an overwhelming defeat.-

743
01:11:55,515 --> 01:12:00,266
incredible.
And no word from Sheridan.

744
01:12:01,753 --> 01:12:03,420
I'm afraid he was away.

745
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:09,200
It means the defeat of all our plans.

746
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:13,538
Yes, for we'll have
to withdraw Grant from Richmond

747
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:15,976
to protect Washington.

748
01:12:22,976 --> 01:12:25,564
Come on, boys! Come on!

749
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,806
General,
the right wing is in full retreat.

750
01:14:00,082 --> 01:14:01,294
impossible to hold our position, sir.

751
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:05,017
Tell Colonel Tolliver
to reform and hold at all costs.

752
01:14:05,142 --> 01:14:06,275
We're going back!

753
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,202
Officers, reform your men!

754
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:14,682
We're going back!

755
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:33,326
- Come on boys, let's go!
- Let's go, boys!

756
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,813
Forward!
Forward to victory!

757
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:57,623
- Down with, the traitor,-
- up with the star!-

758
01:14:57,897 --> 01:14:59,633
- While we rally-
- 'round the flag boys,-

759
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:01,431
- We'll rally-
- once again,-

760
01:15:01,813 --> 01:15:04,627
- shouting the battle cry of freedom!-

761
01:15:05,312 --> 01:15:06,946
- Yes, we'll rally 'round the flag, boys-

762
01:15:07,178 --> 01:15:08,765
- We'll rally once again,-

763
01:15:09,157 --> 01:15:12,456
- Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

764
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:16,338
- We will rally from the hillside,-
- We'll gather from the plain.-

765
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,174
- Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

766
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:24,480
- The Union forever,-
- hurrah, boys, hurrah!-

767
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:27,938
- Sown with the traitor,-
- up with the star.-

768
01:15:28,058 --> 01:15:30,144
- While we rally round the flag boys,-

769
01:15:30,379 --> 01:15:32,119
- We'll rally once again,-

770
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:35,664
- Shouting the battle cry of freedom,-

771
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:51,553
- Arrived in time to reform forces.-

772
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:53,540
- Have struck the enemy-

773
01:15:54,266 --> 01:15:57,561
- and have won an
overwhelming victory. Sheridan.-

774
01:15:58,866 --> 01:16:00,036
I knew it.

775
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:02,316
I knew it...

776
01:16:07,612 --> 01:16:13,272
Better and better. Look! Here
Tremendous number of prisoners.

777
01:16:14,993 --> 01:16:16,325
Prisoners?

778
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:22,030
I hope there's nothing
but prisoners from now on.

779
01:16:26,516 --> 01:16:29,710
The ship, Stanton!

780
01:16:31,048 --> 01:16:32,559
Yes, Mr. President,

781
01:16:33,517 --> 01:16:34,769
and Sheridan!

782
01:17:38,104 --> 01:17:39,462
Surrender...

783
01:17:40,803 --> 01:17:42,694
my poor army!

784
01:17:44,074 --> 01:17:47,070
I'd rather die a thousand deaths
than do that to them.

785
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:50,871
There, General,
you must lie down and rest.

786
01:17:53,352 --> 01:17:54,563
Rest...

787
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,294
that's a beautiful word...

788
01:18:37,894 --> 01:18:41,582
They've caught a spy and they want
the order for his execution approved.

789
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:01,389
Colonel Marshall...

790
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:03,904
who was that?

791
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,609
- Only a courier, sir.
- What did he want?

792
01:19:06,725 --> 01:19:09,645
They've caught a spy.
I approved the execution order, sir.

793
01:19:10,148 --> 01:19:11,280
Colonel,

794
01:19:12,317 --> 01:19:16,916
the only reason for shooting a spy
is the protection of an army, isn't it?

795
01:19:17,298 --> 01:19:18,466
Yes, sir.

796
01:19:19,429 --> 01:19:20,834
Well,

797
01:19:22,014 --> 01:19:25,205
you and I know
that this army can't exist much longer.

798
01:19:27,339 --> 01:19:28,473
isn't that right?

799
01:19:29,888 --> 01:19:31,101
Yes, sir.

800
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:35,282
That is why I am unwilling
that there shall be a single life lost

801
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,261
unnecessarily.

802
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:42,695
Colonel...

803
01:19:43,048 --> 01:19:46,812
I wonder if you'd mind
countermanding that order.

804
01:19:48,753 --> 01:19:49,963
I will.
Yes, sir.

805
01:20:29,336 --> 01:20:30,667
Tired, Grant?

806
01:20:32,225 --> 01:20:33,635
Not much.

807
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,436
Mr. President, we have them.

808
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:57,934
It can only last a few days more.

809
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:02,229
General Sherman and I are glad
of this chance to talk with you.

810
01:21:03,307 --> 01:21:07,097
The Union...
we've saved it at last.

811
01:21:07,565 --> 01:21:09,228
They must surrender soon.

812
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,504
The Union...

813
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,445
We'll have 'em all back...

814
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:18,932
United, free...
one Country.

815
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,255
And meanwhile, Mr. President?

816
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,274
I've heard the country
wishes all rebel property confiscated

817
01:21:27,226 --> 01:21:31,900
and the rebel generals,
such as Lee, shot for treason.

818
01:21:33,008 --> 01:21:35,052
He's put up a grand battle.

819
01:21:37,153 --> 01:21:40,119
And they've robbed
the cradle and the grave, sir.

820
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:43,998
Lee is fighting with his last breath.

821
01:21:46,206 --> 01:21:47,722
Shoot Robert E. Lee?

822
01:21:48,718 --> 01:21:51,531
Someone will have to shoot
Abraham Lincoln first.

823
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:55,483
They're rebels, not traitors.

824
01:21:56,818 --> 01:21:59,164
And their horses and baggage, sir?

825
01:22:00,585 --> 01:22:02,747
They'll need them
for the spring plowing.

826
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:05,523
Let 'em keep 'em and get to work.

827
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:08,038
Very good, sir.

828
01:22:08,838 --> 01:22:11,304
Just one thing more, Mr. President...

829
01:22:12,106 --> 01:22:15,676
the head of the rebel government
Jefferson Davis?

830
01:22:18,421 --> 01:22:19,633
Jefferson Davis...

831
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,804
Do you wish his capture?

832
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:26,861
That reminds me of a story.

833
01:22:27,932 --> 01:22:29,717
We had a terrible drunkard once

834
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:32,948
in Springfield.

835
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,404
Finally he signed the pledge.

836
01:22:36,491 --> 01:22:37,970
Next day he got thirsty

837
01:22:38,122 --> 01:22:40,321
and went to a bar
and ordered a lemonade.

838
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,614
While the bartender was fixing it,
the old drunk got sadder and sadder.

839
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,114
Finally he leaned over
and said to the bartender,

840
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,713
"Mike, while you're fixin' that,

841
01:22:53,986 --> 01:22:55,877
couldn't you put
a nice little shot of whiskey in,

842
01:22:56,114 --> 01:22:57,673
unbeknownst to myself?"

843
01:22:58,282 --> 01:22:59,537
Well, sir?

844
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:02,792
Couldn't you sort
of lot Jeff Davis escape,

845
01:23:04,132 --> 01:23:05,804
unbeknownst to yourselves?

846
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:08,702
We'll do our part, sir.

847
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:16,275
We're going to take them back
as though they'd never been away.

848
01:23:24,328 --> 01:23:25,693
Lincoln...

849
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,446
He freed the negroes.

850
01:23:34,313 --> 01:23:37,161
He's suppressed
the right of a trail by jury.

851
01:23:40,523 --> 01:23:41,887
He muzzled the press!

852
01:23:46,924 --> 01:23:49,122
Now, with the aid of this "butternuts",

853
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:52,024
his army and his negroes,
he make himself

854
01:23:52,106 --> 01:23:53,515
King of the America.

855
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:56,975
Lincoln!

856
01:24:02,009 --> 01:24:03,344
I drink to him...

857
01:24:06,471 --> 01:24:09,059
and his domation!

858
01:24:14,317 --> 01:24:15,608
Right,

859
01:24:15,882 --> 01:24:17,210
you're right.

860
01:24:17,823 --> 01:24:19,461
On my part...

861
01:24:24,568 --> 01:24:27,464
Go on,
you're among friends...

862
01:24:30,245 --> 01:24:34,200
The man who kills Abraham Lincoln

863
01:24:35,347 --> 01:24:37,095
will be immortal.

864
01:24:39,772 --> 01:24:41,059
Now, listen...

865
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:48,340
I have a plan...

866
01:24:49,904 --> 01:24:51,040
and I'm going in.

867
01:25:03,205 --> 01:25:05,674
Do you mind my smoking, Mrs. Lincoln?

868
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:08,001
No, not much.

869
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,373
You don't know how glad we all are
that you were reelected, Mr. President.

870
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:15,280
I'm sure this lady will be glad

871
01:25:15,509 --> 01:25:16,950
to spend four more years
in the White House.

872
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,349
Glad? I've just hired two new maids.

873
01:25:21,722 --> 01:25:24,951
Lincoln, will you ever learn
to keep your feet in shoes?

874
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:30,330
Mrs. Lincoln,
have you met General Grant?

875
01:25:30,561 --> 01:25:33,683
I met him. It took us a week
to get the smoke out of the curtains.

876
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:39,998
Yes, Oglesby, he's one
human being who has faults.

877
01:25:40,997 --> 01:25:43,441
A party of prohibitionists,
called on me the other day

878
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:45,339
and complained about Grant's drinking.

879
01:25:46,335 --> 01:25:48,847
I told 'em if I knew what brand he uses,

880
01:25:49,113 --> 01:25:51,207
I'd send barrels of it
to my other generals.

881
01:25:53,117 --> 01:25:54,939
Two new maids...

882
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,712
if we're going to be
here four more years...

883
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:05,689
Four years...
four more years...

884
01:26:06,031 --> 01:26:09,004
Mr. Lincoln, don't you go thinking
about of those dreams again.

885
01:26:09,538 --> 01:26:13,418
You'll live two hundred and after
we'll celebrate it right over here,

886
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:17,951
we'll travel around the world
and have a nice long rest.

887
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:22,521
Oh, Daddy!
Would that be fun?

888
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,221
- You're not going without me...?
- Why, of course not, Tad.

889
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:34,034
You can depend on Mother Surratt,
and everything is straight with me.

890
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:37,504
I said I'd go through with it,
and I will.

891
01:26:38,341 --> 01:26:41,694
Tonight will be remembered
throughout the ages.

892
01:26:43,982 --> 01:26:46,755
I play my best part.

893
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:55,673
How much better a dagger would look,

894
01:26:59,148 --> 01:27:01,163
Cassius used a dagger,

895
01:27:05,051 --> 01:27:06,690
but this is safer.

896
01:27:32,411 --> 01:27:35,228
- Speech!
- Speech!

897
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:46,313
- Speech!
- Speech!

898
01:27:55,462 --> 01:27:58,614
Again I say,

899
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:02,583
with malice toward none,

900
01:28:03,921 --> 01:28:06,087
with charity for all,

901
01:28:08,341 --> 01:28:10,051
with firmness in the right

902
01:28:10,244 --> 01:28:12,642
as God gives us to see the right,

903
01:28:13,754 --> 01:28:17,933
we shall bind up
the nation's wounds and cherish peace.

904
01:28:22,285 --> 01:28:29,480
That government of the people,
by the people, for the people

905
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:33,411
shall not perish from the earth.

906
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:38,814
Thank you.

907
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:44,118
God bless you all.

908
01:28:57,834 --> 01:29:02,062
Mr. Lincoln, I'm just proud of you!

909
01:29:05,645 --> 01:29:08,390
- Peanuts, hold the horse for me?
- Yes.

910
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:14,669
Will you be long, sir?

911
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:18,708
No, not very long.

912
01:29:23,478 --> 01:29:26,403
Dundreary,
would you mind bringing me a wrap?

913
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:28,200
I feel a draught.

914
01:29:28,547 --> 01:29:31,137
I'm afraid you must be mistaken.

915
01:29:31,785 --> 01:29:33,195
Mr. Lincoln...

916
01:29:33,689 --> 01:29:35,705
has just stopped the draft.

917
01:29:59,865 --> 01:30:02,531
I reckon I'm going
to feel right to home here, b'gosh!

918
01:30:03,636 --> 01:30:06,453
I would be too if it wasn't for
that 'ternal servant-critter

919
01:30:06,685 --> 01:30:08,931
with brass buttons on his coat.

920
01:30:12,937 --> 01:30:17,270
He just swells out his big bosom
like a turkey cock in layin' time,

921
01:30:18,764 --> 01:30:22,338
looks at me as if I meant
to esquatulate with the spoons.

922
01:30:25,088 --> 01:30:29,012
I reckon they don't know who they're
dealin' with, but I'll show 'em.

923
01:30:29,738 --> 01:30:32,706
I'm as obstinate
as Deacon Stumpp's forelock.

924
01:30:33,852 --> 01:30:35,943
"It wouldn't lie down; it couldn't stand up,"

925
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:39,300
wouldn't point forward and couldn't go backward.

926
01:30:41,243 --> 01:30:43,988
I don't know what
they're going to do with me,

927
01:30:44,598 --> 01:30:48,022
but whatever they do do
and wherever they put me,

928
01:30:48,294 --> 01:30:50,461
I hope it's outa
the reach of that jackass.

929
01:30:51,724 --> 01:30:54,495
I'm a real hoss, I am,

930
01:30:54,580 --> 01:30:57,050
and I get kinda riley with them critters.

931
01:30:58,506 --> 01:31:02,461
They say I don't know
the manners of good society too,

932
01:31:03,993 --> 01:31:07,374
but I guess I know enough
to turn that old gal inside out,

933
01:31:08,526 --> 01:31:10,650
the sock-dollaging old mantrap.

934
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:13,973
But I dare no more kill her

935
01:31:14,242 --> 01:31:16,027
than I dare ask Queen Victoria

936
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:18,696
to dance a Cape Cod reel.

937
01:31:28,529 --> 01:31:31,727
Sic semper tyrannis!

938
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:37,255
Mr. Lincoln,
Mr. Lincoln has been shot!

939
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:53,333
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!
