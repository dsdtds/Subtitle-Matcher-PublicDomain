1
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:03,701
What's going on?

2
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:05,856
That's what I must know.
You heard the scream?

3
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:07,957
Anyone hurt?
- I heard a shot from the stage.

4
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,303
That's what I heard.

5
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:12,264
Tony the clown is trying to calm them.

6
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:14,828
Alright, folks, don't worry.
The show is going right on.

7
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,173
The music, boys.
Yes, I'll take care of it.

8
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,461
Boys, the music.

9
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,083
Let me out of here. I'm going home.
- You can't go home.

10
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,394
Where was the shot?
Where is Eddie? Where's Scottie?

11
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,278
Where did they go?

12
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:28,714
Eddie.

13
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,591
Eddie. Eddie, where are you?

14
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,767
Pretty good, huh?

15
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:12,190
Ladies and gentlemen. Please. Quiet.

16
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:13,444
Quiet.

17
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,440
I regret to announce we are forced
to terminate tonight's performance.

18
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,181
There's been an accident here tonight.
But there's no need for alarm.

19
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,901
Just walk out quietly and your money
will be refunded at the box office.

20
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:04,201
Don't leave the theater.

21
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,898
You'll all be questioned later.
Come now. Step lively please.

22
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:14,868
If you tell the truth it will
save us a lot of trouble.

23
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,627
You quarrelled with your
wife tonight, didn't you?

24
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,149
Didn't you?

25
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,097
Yes. We had an argument.
- It all adds up to murder.

26
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:24,113
No. I tell you I didn't do it.

27
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,851
I had nothing to do with it.

28
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:27,507
You expect me to believe that?

29
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:30,000
I tell you again.
We just had an argument.

30
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,060
Ordinary people argue once in a while.
It doesn't mean anything.

31
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,019
But this was more than an argument.

32
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,124
Look. Haven't you got any feelings?
My wife has just been killed.

33
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:43,232
Well?

34
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,947
I just found this under the sofa.

35
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,376
Four shots fired.

36
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,319
I found two of them in the wall.

37
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,454
I guess the other two are in the body.

38
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:51,514
Poor Eddie.

39
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:53,127
It's a dirty shame.

40
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:54,673
Yeah.

41
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:57,528
I've been working here
for seventeen years.

42
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,430
And never saw a prettier smile.

43
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,035
She was nice to everybody.

44
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,268
You should know.

45
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:03,649
She was dynamite.

46
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:07,157
If me and Sam played the same bill with
her, I never let him out of my sight.

47
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,811
Only last night her light was out
and she wanted me to fix it.

48
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:12,306
And now ..

49
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,984
Her light is out for ever.

50
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:15,964
You see.

51
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,145
Them that least deserves it gets it.

52
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,473
Better phone the headquarters again.

53
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,986
Get everyone on state for questioning.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:26,489
Everybody on stage.

55
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,845
I guess this simplifies
the whole matter.

56
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:30,095
What does?

57
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:31,651
Look at this.

58
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,093
I suppose you never
saw it before, did you?

59
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,900
You're right. I didn't.

60
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,794
We just found it in your dressing room.

61
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,148
This is the gun you
shot her with, is it?

62
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,356
She was my wife.

63
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,918
I loved her.
You don't kill the woman you love.

64
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,677
Get the rest of the performers up here.

65
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,575
But without Rosita. She's fainted.

66
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:54,792
But I'll get them, sir. Right away.

67
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,181
You.

68
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:58,410
Monsieur.
- Name?

69
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:00,413
Franï¿½ois Gaston, Monsieur.

70
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,534
Profession?
- I'm an artist, Monsieur.

71
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:05,049
You see. I'm .. how you say it?
Comment dites-vous que ..?

72
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:06,975
I jump in and out of the barrel.

73
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:09,777
You see?
- Hiding in a barrel.

74
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:15,715
Over here.

75
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,623
Name.
- Sally Hampton.

76
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:25,464
Ten minutes of snappy songs
and sassy sayings. That's us.

77
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:26,672
Right?
- Right.

78
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,440
What do you know about this killing?
- Not a thing, Your Honor.

79
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,839
I mean, Mr Officer.
We were in our dressing room.

80
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:34,963
We didn't see nothing, we didn't hear
nothing and we don't know nothing.

81
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:36,171
Right?
- Right.

82
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,308
Did you know the deceased?
- I'll say.

83
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:42,101
And if you want my opinion, she didn't
get no more than what was coming to her.

84
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:43,491
Right?
- Wrong.

85
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,408
Right.
- Next.

86
00:07:55,594 --> 00:07:56,770
She was strangled.

87
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:04,584
So she wasn't shot.

88
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:06,903
She was strangled.

89
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,363
Now what?
- Strangled?

90
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,330
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

91
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,145
You're the only one who doesn't.

92
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:17,797
Take this man to headquarters
for further questioning.

93
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,071
I wish I hadn't been here tonight.

94
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:27,308
It was awful.

95
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:28,521
Yeah.

96
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:30,331
Just like I say.

97
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,985
You can live a whole life backstage.

98
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:34,677
In just one night.

99
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,603
Last week, a stalker almost
caught up with Joe's wife.

100
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:40,568
And tonight.

101
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,455
I don't even want to think about it.

102
00:08:43,949 --> 00:08:44,888
Those screams.

103
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:48,251
Now I think of it I, should
have investigated them sooner.

104
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,143
Pop.

105
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:51,652
You've seen a lot of things
in your time, haven't you.

106
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,090
Every day.

107
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,663
It makes me feel that fellow was right.

108
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:58,191
Life is nothing but a stage.

109
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:00,219
And everybody plays on it.

110
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,351
Yep.

111
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,629
Only some of them get better billing.

112
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,891
I guess you never know
when your exit is coming.

113
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:08,651
It's better that way.

114
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:10,196
Well.

115
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:12,692
I'd better go and finish my work.

116
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,919
Oh .. don't forget to turn out
the lights when you're through.

117
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:16,963
Okay, Pop.

118
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:46,270
Who is there?

119
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:48,133
Who is up there?

120
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:02,799
Who are you?

121
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,040
Say, I've seen you before.

122
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:07,930
Sure I have.

123
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,031
You are Flamarion.

124
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,770
The Great Flamarion.

125
00:10:13,776 --> 00:10:14,893
The Great Flamarion.

126
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:17,032
I am Tony. The clown.

127
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,744
I played on the same bill
as you in Pittsburgh.

128
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:21,502
Remember me?

129
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:26,732
Water.

130
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,153
You are hurt, Flamarion.

131
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,992
I'll get a doctor.
- No, no.

132
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,730
Please don't.
- But you're liable to die.

133
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:08,679
Yes.

134
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:11,813
You don't know what you're saying.
Nobody wants to die.

135
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:13,552
I do.

136
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,188
Why?

137
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:20,158
Because I killed Connie.

138
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:21,848
You?

139
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:24,929
She shot me and ..

140
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:27,415
I strangled her.

141
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,778
But they're holding her husband.

142
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,232
Tell them ..

143
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,136
He is innocent.

144
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:37,468
You had better tell them yourself.
They may not believe me.

145
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,374
I'll have them here in no time.

146
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:40,620
It's no use.

147
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,881
I'll be dead before they get here.

148
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:48,124
But.

149
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:49,740
Before I die.

150
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:53,841
I want to tell you, Tony.

151
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,203
Why I killed her.

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,745
Let me.

153
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:02,060
Let me.

154
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,369
Go ahead.

155
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,088
Talk then.

156
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,955
The story starts in Pittsburgh.

157
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:17,370
You remember my act.

158
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:19,656
And my ..

159
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:22,074
Two assistants. Connie and ..

160
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:23,711
Al Wallace.

161
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,145
[ Door knocks ]

162
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:02,661
Mr Flamarion.

163
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,080
How about giving another bow
before they tear up the seats?

164
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,150
Let them.

165
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,872
You were on beat off
in front of the mirror.

166
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,801
You came directly into my line of fire.
- I'm sorry, boss.

167
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,218
And I know why.

168
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:19,421
Just one little one. Not enough to ..
- Enough to cause an accident.

169
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,872
I'll take my chances with you anytime.

170
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,392
But it won't happen again.

171
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:25,461
My act runs according to my rules.

172
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:27,228
Those who break them .. are out.

173
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:32,586
Mr Flamarion.

174
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:36,578
Mr Flamarion.

175
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,163
I'm sorry about Al's performance.
- So am I.

176
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:44,396
I promise you it won't happen again.

177
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:46,699
It's not up to you to make that promise.

178
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,236
Don't worry. Al will do as I say.

179
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,748
There's no room for
mistakes no matter what.

180
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,229
I must be absolutely
sure of my assistants.

181
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,414
But Mr Flamarion.

182
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:00,768
You can always be sure of me.

183
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,893
I guess you don't realize how
important all this is to me.

184
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:07,579
The continued success of
my act is my only concern.

185
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,579
And mine.

186
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:11,164
It's the only thing that
makes my life bearable.

187
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,307
If I couldn't look forward to
the theater and the lights ..

188
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,019
Just seeing you.

189
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:18,731
I wouldn't care if I
never woke up again.

190
00:16:19,263 --> 00:16:21,765
Your personal feelings do
not interest me in the least.

191
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,357
I repeat once and for all:
one more mistake ..

192
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:26,297
And I'm through with both of you.

193
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:38,528
<i>I had picked up Connie and her
husband Al six months before</i>.

194
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,169
<i>When they were a third-rate dancing act</i>.

195
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,421
<i>I had always thought of them
as a happily-married couple</i>.

196
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,611
Okay, lush. That will be enough of that.

197
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,181
You heard Flamarion.

198
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,915
Maybe you like sleeping on
a park bench but I don't.

199
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:03,850
You scared it might cramp your style?

200
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,534
One more crack like that and
you'll be down for the count.

201
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,264
Don't try playing rough with me.

202
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,415
Brother, you're asking for it.

203
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:16,910
Can't you stay sober long enough
to stooge for a couple of guns?

204
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:19,555
It seems even a moron would
have backbone enough to ..

205
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:21,281
So now I'm a moron, huh?

206
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,714
You've changed your tune since the
day you bought our wedding ring.

207
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,483
Are you scared I might
slip off the hook?

208
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,788
Look, Al. Let's not go
into that routine again.

209
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,340
There's an easy way out of all this ..
- Another routine we won't go into.

210
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,540
If you think I'll let you go so another
guy can have you, you're nuts.

211
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:41,370
I'll get away from you sometime.

212
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:44,268
You haven't got a prayer.

213
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:46,568
Let's see.

214
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,950
There was the business with
the diamond ring in Memphis.

215
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:52,691
The insurance company
are still interested in that.

216
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,719
And that little trick you pulled
on the guy in Salt Lake City.

217
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,980
He would love to know where to find you.

218
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,584
That quick shuffle you gave the
bank president in Des Moines.

219
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,045
Whatever did become
of those bonds, Connie?

220
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,003
I didn't find out until
after I married you.

221
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:10,843
What a busy life you had led.

222
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:14,305
No. I don't think you'll
get away from me.

223
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:17,174
Not until I'm good and
ready to let you go.

224
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:22,045
Quit it, honey.

225
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,184
You're just wasting a lot of valuable
time on yesterday's bad news.

226
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:28,492
Doesn't it interest you?
- No.

227
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,239
Only tonight interests me.

228
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:33,010
Going someplace?

229
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:34,353
Sure I am.

230
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:36,976
I am going home with my husband.

231
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:43,908
Connie. No matter what you do,
you're the only dame for me.

232
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:45,863
You're a bad habit I can't cure.

233
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,456
Even if I wanted to.

234
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:55,838
Any guy that wouldn't fall for you
is either a sucker or he's dead.

235
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,121
<i>I lived a lonely life</i>.

236
00:19:05,804 --> 00:19:07,166
<i>I have no friends</i>.

237
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:10,813
<i>I didn't like people and
people didn't like me</i>.

238
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,469
<i>I didn't drink. I didn't smoke</i>.

239
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,427
<i>I retired every night immediately
after the performance</i>.

240
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,572
<i>For hours I practised
to strengthen my eyes</i>.

241
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,940
<i>This afternoon my schedule was broken</i>.

242
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,651
<i>I had an unexpected visitor</i>.

243
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,997
[ Door knocks ]

244
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:33,909
Who is it?

245
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,230
It's me. Connie.

246
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:38,123
Mrs Wallace, I am busy.
I'll see you at the theater.

247
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:39,698
I've got to talk to you.

248
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:49,811
This sign means exactly what it says.

249
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,764
You must listen. It's important.

250
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:55,081
Well?

251
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,884
I've found out why Al is drinking.

252
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:00,969
The reason for his conduct
doesn't interest me.

253
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,725
Except as it affects my act.

254
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:05,602
This affects you because it's personal.

255
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:08,338
He is jealous of you.
- Ridiculous.

256
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:10,998
Jealous of me because I am
a star and he's a nobody?

257
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:15,398
Am I responsible for his being a
drunkard without ambition or talent?

258
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:19,032
Has he any idea of how hard I
had to work to get where I am?

259
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:20,333
Al knows all that.

260
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,000
There's more to life than
what happens in a theater.

261
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,208
What is it then?

262
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,110
I think he knows how I feel about you.

263
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:29,347
How <i>you</i> feel about me?

264
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:31,972
Your work has always been satisfactory.

265
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:36,510
You work for hours to strengthen you
eyes but can't see. You are blind.

266
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,794
It had to happen.

267
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,074
I'm only sorry he found
out before you did.

268
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:44,652
I don't understand.

269
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,434
Imagine what I go through every night.

270
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:49,436
The music starts and the act begins.

271
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,592
I move about the stage like a puppet.

272
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,216
And then you enter and
everything begins to live.

273
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,526
Come to the point.

274
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,332
The excitement of being on stage facing
the man who holds my life in his hands.

275
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,170
You don't have to be afraid.
- No.

276
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,202
It's a strange sensation.

277
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,284
You look at me.

278
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:09,160
Your eyes are so steady, so piercing.

279
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:11,918
You aim and fire and the
bullet cuts through the air.

280
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:15,038
I close my eyes. Then I feel the bullet
hit the target, my shoulder strap.

281
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,238
I tell myself it was your hand.

282
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,213
Every bullet is a caress.

283
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:25,634
Do you see now?

284
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:32,234
Mrs Wallace.

285
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:35,016
Of course, you realize now I
must look for two new assistants.

286
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:37,634
No, Flamarion. No, please.
- You've left me no choice.

287
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,975
Okay, so we close tonight.

288
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,676
And you go to Frisco alone.

289
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:45,510
See how the act goes without us.

290
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:47,975
Wait.

291
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:55,072
Considering the fact it's impossible for
me to replace you at such short notice.

292
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,854
I'll have to overlook what happened.

293
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,183
You can go with me to San Francisco.

294
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:03,821
Thank you, Flamarion. Thank you.

295
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,842
<i>That was the way Connie began</i>.

296
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,613
<i>It was her first approach</i>.

297
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,227
<i>I didn't know what was coming</i>.

298
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,281
I've been waiting
for you for half an hour.

299
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:54,185
I thought you would never get here.
- How did you get in here?

300
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:57,144
Wouldn't you rather know <i>why</i> than <i>how?</i>
- I'm not interested ..

301
00:22:57,354 --> 00:22:59,458
In me or anything about me.
I know the line.

302
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:03,401
Mrs Wallace, please go.

303
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:05,450
Close the door.

304
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,910
I don't see any reason why I should.
- Please, Flamarion.

305
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:20,219
I know all about Alma.

306
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,789
How do you know?

307
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,195
You went through my suitcase?

308
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:27,751
You're human.

309
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,104
Darling, I wasn't really spying.

310
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,827
Maybe a lady wouldn't do it.
But I'm just a woman in love.

311
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:36,013
I had to see what made you afraid of me.
- I'm not afraid of anybody.

312
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:38,623
Yes you are.
You're afraid of your heart.

313
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,832
I'll never allow a woman
to enter my life again.

314
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:43,541
Isn't that silly?
Just because you were burned once.

315
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,208
I must ask you again to leave.

316
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:47,996
I had to come.
Al is at it again. He beat me.

317
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:50,479
I'm not interested in
your domestic problems.

318
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:54,093
You don't want to believe anything.
Do I have to prove everything to you?

319
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,102
I'll show you.
- Never mind. Get out.

320
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:57,265
What are you?

321
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,455
Haven't you any feelings?

322
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:02,282
Isn't there any place in your
life for anything but your work?

323
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,788
Don't you care about what
happens to me at all?

324
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,745
I thought I made that perfectly clear.

325
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:08,951
We work together but that's all.
Understand?

326
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,843
Flamarion, you can't toss me out
like this. I haven't any place to go.

327
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,989
Al is crazy drunk. If I go back now ..

328
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,313
I'll arrange for the porter
to get you another room.

329
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,946
The train has sold out.

330
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,970
That's no concern of mine.
- Isn't it?

331
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,334
Does it mean anything to you that when
I'm in trouble my one thought is of you?

332
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:26,990
I forbid you to speak this way.

333
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,188
I can't help it and it's your affair.

334
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,915
Al is on a bender because ..

335
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,185
Because he knows I love you.

336
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,588
That settles it.

337
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,835
You both leave the act in San Francisco.

338
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:43,819
Simple, isn't it.

339
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:46,155
I am honest, and what are my thanks?

340
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:47,780
You fire us.
- Exactly.

341
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,349
So it's curtains for the Wallaces, huh?

342
00:24:51,514 --> 00:24:54,135
Now I guess it's up to me to go back
and break the glad news to Al.

343
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,642
He'll probably start in
right where he left off.

344
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:58,988
The funny part of it is
I don't give a hoot.

345
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:01,319
And you don't either, do you Flamarion?

346
00:25:02,358 --> 00:25:04,818
I do feel a certain responsibility.
- Then let me stay here.

347
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,039
No.
- Please.

348
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,553
Life is funny.

349
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:11,178
I guess it happens to
everyone sooner or later.

350
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:15,790
It's not much fun to show your heart and
see it get kicked about until it breaks.

351
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,080
Well.

352
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:21,460
Thanks for the lesson.

353
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:22,682
Alright.

354
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:25,874
You may stay.

355
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,002
You know, Flamarion.

356
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,452
I just found out what
is the matter with you.

357
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,609
You are asleep.

358
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,666
Maybe this will wake you up.

359
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,278
<i>It struck me like lightning</i>.

360
00:26:00,752 --> 00:26:02,394
<i>Not for fifteen years</i>.

361
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,961
<i>Not since the tragedy of Alma
and my dismissal from the army</i>.

362
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:08,518
<i>Had I been so close to a woman</i>.

363
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:12,994
<i>One look into a mirror would have
shown me I was not for her</i>.

364
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,470
<i>But there must have been
something else behind it</i>.

365
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:19,938
<i>It was three days from
Pittsburgh to San Francisco</i>.

366
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:23,151
<i>And in all that time she never
went back to her husband</i>.

367
00:26:24,043 --> 00:26:26,146
<i>I suppose he was too drunk to care</i>.

368
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:30,595
<i>It seemed that a new
life had just begun</i>.

369
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:34,839
<i>In reality, it was the
beginning of the end</i>.

370
00:26:44,331 --> 00:26:47,036
Shall I serve now?
- No. I am waiting for a lady.

371
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,914
This is a very special occasion.

372
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:52,151
Thank you.

373
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:07,151
Hello darling.

374
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,633
You remember what you said
that night on the train?

375
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,793
I thought you would never get here.

376
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:19,254
Orchids and champagne.
You think of everything.

377
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:21,679
I am trembling.

378
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,901
You were steady as a rock
during the act tonight.

379
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:25,844
Yes. But I wasn't waiting for you then.

380
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,042
I love your hands.

381
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:36,572
I stopped in at a little
shop on Grand Avenue.

382
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,093
Oh. A present.

383
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:40,502
I hope you like it.

384
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:43,790
The first gift I've made to
a woman in fifteen years.

385
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:50,559
Flamarion, it is beautiful.

386
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:54,109
I bought it because I ..

387
00:27:54,822 --> 00:27:56,234
I seem to see you in it.

388
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:57,867
And you will, darling.

389
00:27:58,195 --> 00:27:59,550
But you must keep it for me.

390
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:02,143
All would know I could never
afford something so expensive.

391
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,597
His drinking is getting worse.

392
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,072
It worries me.

393
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:13,447
Yes. During the last show in Pittsburgh
I had to watch his every move.

394
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,778
Yes. I know.

395
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:16,942
One mistake ..

396
00:28:17,152 --> 00:28:20,269
One serious mistake on
his part may be fatal.

397
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:24,826
It frightens me to even think of it.
- He should be the one to think of it.

398
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:27,014
Does he realize that ..

399
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:29,305
My only reason for keeping him is you?

400
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:32,373
If you want <i>me</i> you've got to keep <i>him</i>.

401
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,754
I've always been his meal ticket.

402
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:39,646
Perhaps if I .. spoke to him and ..

403
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:41,591
Told him how we feel about each other.

404
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,855
No, darling. That would
only make things worse.

405
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:48,341
But, now we have each other.

406
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,432
Today and tomorrow.

407
00:28:51,472 --> 00:28:53,042
And all the other tomorrows.

408
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,204
Just leave it to me.

409
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,265
I'll figure it out.

410
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,823
She made it sound so wonderful.

411
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,335
So convincing.

412
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:09,035
I believed her because
I wanted to believe her.

413
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:12,471
But what I didn't know then was ..

414
00:29:13,386 --> 00:29:15,490
That on the same bill was a bicycle act.

415
00:29:17,283 --> 00:29:19,088
He was young, handsome.

416
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,059
You know something, honey?
- No. What?

417
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:54,131
You look better to me
now than you ever did.

418
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:55,716
Why didn't you write me?

419
00:29:55,926 --> 00:29:58,268
I'm the kind of guy who likes
to deliver things in person.

420
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,571
How long are you going to be in town?
- Two weeks.

421
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:05,560
Me too.

422
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:08,429
Then separated for months afterwards.

423
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,352
Eddie, our next job is in
Los Angeles. Can't you ..

424
00:30:11,563 --> 00:30:13,914
Look. If I don't make it, it
won't be because I didn't try.

425
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:15,722
Sixteen bars and I'm on.

426
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:19,130
Meet me after the show.
- I wish I could. Al is on the warpath.

427
00:30:19,463 --> 00:30:21,792
Let's make it tomorrow.
That little bar around the corner.

428
00:30:27,204 --> 00:30:28,243
Hiya, babe.

429
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,139
Hello Cleo. What's new?
- Not a thing with me.

430
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:33,446
Is collecting me still your hobby?

431
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,384
Can you think of a better one?

432
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:37,847
Yeah. I'll take my dogs every time.

433
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:39,911
You don't sit up nights
waiting for them.

434
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,754
Good evening, boss.
- Evening.

435
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:44,259
Got a lot of class, ain't they?
- Plenty.

436
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,176
Don't you think so, Connie?

437
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,178
Yeah. They're swell performers.

438
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,863
He certainly is.

439
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,428
Hiya, Maestro. What gives?

440
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:56,107
That guy's family must have
been awfully fond of children.

441
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,120
Flamarion is alright.
- He's just a little strange.

442
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:02,357
Keep right on calling it 'strange'.
But in my book he's strictly a heel.

443
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,342
I guess it's time to get to the office.
See you around, Cleo.

444
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:07,694
Don't go leaning into no bullets.
- Don't worry.

445
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:10,635
Flamarion knows what he's doing.
- Meaning I don't?

446
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,804
See? That's what I meant when
I said I would take my dogs.

447
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:22,150
Do you like it, darling?
- Very much.

448
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,642
And do you like me a little too?

449
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,171
Connie.

450
00:31:29,532 --> 00:31:31,096
We've got to do something about Al.

451
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:35,534
I thought if I were to
make it worth his while.

452
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:38,401
I mean financially.
- He'd only spend what you gave him.

453
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:41,382
And then no dough,
no wife and no meal ticket.

454
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:44,378
Oh no. He'd never stand
for a deal like that.

455
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,431
I want to make a new life for us.

456
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,916
That would be wonderful.

457
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,341
Even if there isn't any
chance to make it come true.

458
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:53,674
It must come true.

459
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,480
You're proud of these, aren't you?

460
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:07,890
They were my only
friends until I found you.

461
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,350
I hope you take as good care of me.

462
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:14,480
Put that down. That's dangerous.

463
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,026
Now you know how I feel.

464
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:18,006
What if I had as little faith in you?

465
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:21,702
I entrust my life to you every night.

466
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,954
That's another reason why we
belong together and always will.

467
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:29,044
I won't even think about
tomorrow without you.

468
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,081
I know.

469
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:33,769
I can't sleep at night. I just lie
awake and dream of tomorrow.

470
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:35,495
Our tomorrow.

471
00:32:36,643 --> 00:32:38,624
The other night I dreamed
about the three of us.

472
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:40,364
It was on stage.

473
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:42,601
You and Al and I.

474
00:32:43,974 --> 00:32:45,683
As Al stood before the mirror you ..

475
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:47,164
Fired and missed.

476
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,420
I never miss.

477
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:50,597
Of course not.

478
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:52,910
Al was drunk. It was an accident.

479
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:03,254
Well.

480
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:05,678
I said it was just a dream, didn't I?

481
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:26,570
I've asked you to come here
because I want to talk to you.

482
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:27,742
Okay.

483
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:29,144
Start talking.

484
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,800
Sit down.

485
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,403
None of my warnings have
meant anything to you.

486
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:39,718
You still continue to drink.

487
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,838
I know how to take care of myself.

488
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,507
Don't you realize, Al ..

489
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:48,159
Every time we step onto that stage
you're nothing but a live target?

490
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:49,705
Which I must miss.

491
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:51,574
I knew that when I took the job.

492
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:54,533
Won't you let me help you?

493
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:56,905
Help me?

494
00:33:57,697 --> 00:33:59,023
Let me lend you some money.

495
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,191
Why? We're booked solid, aren't we?

496
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,826
That means the old lettuce will
be coming in every pay-day.

497
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:09,572
Of course, I could always
use a little extra money.

498
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,542
Did it ever occur to you Al that you're
not cut out for this sort of work?

499
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,144
Why not go back to dancing?
- That costs dough.

500
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:22,197
You may leave that entirely to me.

501
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:26,014
I don't get this.

502
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:30,883
Why should you put up your dough so that
Connie and I can go back to dancing?

503
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,173
I didn't say you and your wife, did I?

504
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:36,788
That is out.

505
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:42,281
But I know now what you're trying to
do and why you're trying to do it.

506
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,183
Connie has been giving you
the business, hasn't she?

507
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:47,222
She's not getting away with it.

508
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:50,341
Sink or swim. Survivor .. perish.

509
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,243
The Wallaces stick together.

510
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:53,574
[ Door knocks ]

511
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,801
15 minutes.

512
00:34:55,307 --> 00:34:56,395
Alright. Thank you.

513
00:34:56,952 --> 00:35:00,050
I've got to get made up
but what I said still goes.

514
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:02,078
The Wallaces stick together.

515
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:04,936
So stop trying to run
our lives right now.

516
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,163
<i>Al stood before the mirror</i>.

517
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:29,405
<i>You fired and missed</i>.

518
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,022
<i>Fired and missed</i>.

519
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,286
<i>Fired and missed</i>.

520
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:43,463
What's eating you?

521
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:46,542
I've had just about all of
Mr Flamarion I can use.

522
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:48,847
And vice-versa I should say.

523
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,696
What goes with you and him anyway?

524
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,661
With me and Flamarion?

525
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:55,257
Don't be a sap.

526
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:58,992
That guy wouldn't be interested in Venus
unless she had some guns in her girdle.

527
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:01,630
He just had me in his dressing
room for a pep talk.

528
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:04,984
Which ended up with him trying to
ease me out of the act and keep you.

529
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,985
In exchange for a little dough.

530
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:10,284
Are you kidding?
- Do I look like it?

531
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:14,414
What a nerve that guy has.
Trying to run out lives for us.

532
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:17,020
He covered up by telling me
it was for my own good.

533
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,482
What a dirty chiseller.

534
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:22,157
Imagine trying to come between
a husband and wife that way.

535
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:25,322
And the crummy way he did it.
Offering you money. As though I were ..

536
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:27,949
I don't know what kept me from
punching him right on the nose.

537
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:31,372
Honey.

538
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:34,791
You know what we're going to do?
We're going to quit the act.

539
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:38,042
But baby, we ain't got no dough.

540
00:36:38,442 --> 00:36:39,677
We can't afford to quit.

541
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:42,534
Now I know what sort of man he is
I won't work with him any longer.

542
00:36:43,614 --> 00:36:45,422
And I am surprised at you, honey.

543
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:47,505
Haven't you any pride left?

544
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:49,703
Yeah, but that check
coming in every Tuesday ..

545
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,550
Is the difference between meat on
the table and no bread in the house.

546
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:54,449
Don't worry, sugar.

547
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,236
We'll get another job.

548
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,836
And we'll get it quick.

549
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:01,756
You are a funny kid, Connie.

550
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,219
I don't mind telling you I
had you figured all wrong.

551
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:09,824
Just what did you think the score was?

552
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:11,983
I don't know.

553
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:16,115
But it looked to me like you were
getting ready to take a powder on me.

554
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:43,409
<i>This evening I was waiting
for her at the usual time</i>.

555
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:45,646
<i>She did not come</i>.

556
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:49,313
<i>I grew more and more restless</i>.

557
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:52,282
<i>Time dragged</i>.

558
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,292
<i>And always was ringing in my
ear was that terrible refrain</i>.

559
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:59,361
<i>Repeated over and over</i>.

560
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,488
<i>Al stood before the mirror</i>.

561
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,484
<i>You fired</i>.

562
00:38:05,126 --> 00:38:06,034
<i>And missed</i>.

563
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,110
<i>You fired</i>.

564
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:09,794
<i>And missed</i>.

565
00:38:11,363 --> 00:38:12,606
<i>It taunted me</i>.

566
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,533
<i>It took possession of me</i>.

567
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:23,116
What about Los Angeles, honey?
Can you make it?

568
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:26,172
It's off. They offered me
a Central American tour.

569
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,383
Eddie, you can't take that.
I won't let you.

570
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:31,576
They were a couple of heels.

571
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:33,396
Al is a good guy.

572
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:36,592
But here I am hiding in
dark corners with his wife.

573
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,008
We don't have to.

574
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,949
It wouldn't make any difference
if he knew all about us.

575
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,318
I just can't figure that way.

576
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:46,321
With you it's all or nothing, huh?

577
00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:47,927
Yeah.

578
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:50,508
That's what makes me think
I'll sign for that tour.

579
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:53,943
Then we wouldn't see each
other for a whole year.

580
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:57,400
I may be able to get you
out of my blood that way.

581
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:01,223
Is that what you want?
To get me out of your blood?

582
00:39:02,764 --> 00:39:04,775
It's going to be tough but
it's the only way out.

583
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,950
It's a cinch it's no
good this way. So ..

584
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:10,191
It is Central America.
- Eddie, don't sign yet. Please.

585
00:39:11,774 --> 00:39:13,125
I have an idea.

586
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,350
Let me try and see
if I can make it work.

587
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,975
I know you and your ideas, honey.

588
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,513
Some of them are good but ..

589
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:25,098
Hey, there is Al.

590
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:30,108
No matter how blind he gets he doesn't
need a seeing-eye to get him to a joint.

591
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:32,049
Shall I ..
- No. Stay where you are.

592
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:33,227
I'll handle it.

593
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:34,563
Al.

594
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:36,431
Over here.

595
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,006
What are you doing here?

596
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,583
I was waiting for you.

597
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:51,728
I thought maybe I could keep
you sober for a change.

598
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:53,914
Eddie asked me to have a drink with him.

599
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,694
Is there anything wrong with that?

600
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,149
Hiya, kid.

601
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:58,459
Hello Al.

602
00:39:58,728 --> 00:40:00,964
I was looking for you.
I need some dough.

603
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:02,444
I haven't any.

604
00:40:02,654 --> 00:40:04,591
What did you do with it?
- What did <i>I</i> do?

605
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:08,025
What do you think is left in our grouch
bag after the way you kicked it around?

606
00:40:08,294 --> 00:40:10,683
For the love of Mike
cut out the preaching.

607
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:13,660
Hey, George. Give me a bourbon.

608
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:16,807
See what the boys in the
back room will have.

609
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,474
Same here, George.

610
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,132
Better make mine a
double bourbon, George.

611
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:24,163
I'm in kind-of a hurry.

612
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,673
Okay, chum.

613
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:30,395
No matter how fast you can drink it, the
distilleries always stay ahead of you.

614
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:31,388
Yep.

615
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:34,339
But by next week I'll have
them working nights to do it.

616
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:41,243
Someday you're going to do that and
not pull back anything but a stump.

617
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:45,671
I've got something better to do than to
sit here watching you get plastered.

618
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,042
Thanks for the drink, Eddie.
I'll be seeing you.

619
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:07,258
You're giving yourself quite
a beating, aren't you.

620
00:41:08,373 --> 00:41:09,848
Are you going to start that too?

621
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,955
It's your wagon, chum.
Paint it any color you want to.

622
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:15,635
Look, Eddie.

623
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,968
Do you know why I am drinking?

624
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:21,389
No. And what's more ..
- Then I'll tell you.

625
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:22,905
It's her.

626
00:41:23,384 --> 00:41:24,231
Connie.

627
00:41:24,928 --> 00:41:26,339
She has got me bats.

628
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:28,227
I don't know which end is up.

629
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,214
What do you mean, Al?

630
00:41:35,471 --> 00:41:36,794
I can't tell you, Eddie.

631
00:41:37,905 --> 00:41:39,317
It's a question of honor.

632
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:44,392
But if she don't cut out some
of the stuff she's pulling.

633
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:46,889
I am going to ..
- You're right, Al.

634
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:48,976
You should not be
talking to me about it.

635
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:50,646

Have testified that Mr Flamarion's
performance went as usual.

799
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,628
In every single detail.

800
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:23,886
The autopsy disclosed the presence of
alcohol in the blood of the deceased.

801
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:28,109
In view of this fact, it is agreed
that Al Wallace's intoxication.

802
00:54:28,574 --> 00:54:31,280
Caused him to make a mistake in
timing which led to his death.

803
00:54:32,116 --> 00:54:34,730
Therefore, the Coroner's
verdict is: 'accidental death'.

804
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,516
The jury is discharged.

805
00:54:54,368 --> 00:54:55,240
I'm sorry.

806
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:10,715
Aren't you ever on time?

807
00:55:11,659 --> 00:55:12,955
Did you miss me very much?

808
00:55:14,025 --> 00:55:16,607
These last two days are the most
miserable I have ever spent.

809
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:18,479
I missed you too.

810
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:27,695
Tickets for Las Vegas?

811
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,797
I went to the bank this morning and I
drew enough money out for a honeymoon.

812
00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:32,496
You shouldn't do that, darling.

813
00:55:32,706 --> 00:55:35,269
You shouldn't have got tickets
on the same train. It's dangerous.

814
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:37,388
Then I leave the next
day and meet you there.

815
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:40,085
If anyone found out you took
all that money out of the bank.

816
00:55:40,676 --> 00:55:43,322
And they saw us together you'd be
begging for a call from the DA.

817
00:55:46,235 --> 00:55:47,239
Are you afraid?

818
00:55:49,085 --> 00:55:50,379
No. It isn't that.

819
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:53,919
Just that I don't want
anything to happen to you.

820
00:55:55,576 --> 00:55:56,769
Nothing will I hope.

821
00:55:58,414 --> 00:56:01,288
You know, it might be a
good idea if I did go away.

822
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:03,499
But just for a little while.

823
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,171
But I said I don't want to be
separated from you again.

824
00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:09,289
Let's be sensible, darling.
We've got to let the grass grow.

825
00:56:10,852 --> 00:56:12,875
We've got the rest of our
lives to be together.

826
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,395
When you figure it that way.

827
00:56:16,443 --> 00:56:18,036
Three months isn't such a long time.

828
00:56:18,247 --> 00:56:19,155
Three months?

829
00:56:25,624 --> 00:56:27,486
Do you think I like the
idea of leaving you?

830
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:30,021
Where will you go?

831
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:31,968
Henning Minnesota.

832
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:34,738
I haven't seen my mother in eight years.

833
00:56:36,076 --> 00:56:38,485
There never was enough
time or money before.

834
00:56:40,186 --> 00:56:42,638
I'll write you every day.
- No. No letters please.

835
00:56:43,696 --> 00:56:45,961
Never put anything in writing.
- Then I'll telephone you.

836
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,194
Don't you understand?
We've got to be strangers.

837
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:51,140
Even my family mustn't
know we're friends.

838
00:56:52,386 --> 00:56:53,747
But we'll make up for it.

839
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:56,929
Connie, you haven't even
given me your address.

840
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,028
So I know at least where you are.

841
00:57:02,564 --> 00:57:04,188
I'd like to send you little presents.

842
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:05,691
To let you know ..

843
00:57:06,277 --> 00:57:07,696
That I am thinking of you.

844
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:12,039
2907 Ferndale is the address
if it's any easier for you.

845
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:14,015
But no gifts.

846
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:16,570
Widows should not have admirers.

847
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:21,371
Please take this. It will remove ..

848

One of my worries until I see you again.

849

And that will be exactly
three months from tonight.

850

October 14th.

851

Where shall we meet?

852
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:34,827
As far away from here as possible.
- What about Chicago?

853
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:37,810
I love Chicago.

854

855
00:57:39,473 --> 00:57:40,590
The Empire hotel.

00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:44,654
I will register under
the name of HJ Brandt.

Mrs Brandt joins you in
Chicago at the Empire hotel.

My name is HJ Brandt.

I have reservations.
- How do you do, Mr Brandt.

Your reservation is for October 14th.

863

Yes. My wife arrives tomorrow but I'd
like to check in now and prepare things.

864

Yes. Of course.

- The vase needs flowers.

Is there a florist in the house?
- Yes, sir.

869

Tomorrow morning I want six dozen roses.

870

Various colors. Long-stemmed.

871
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:35,066
I want some flowers for this vase and
another basket with mixed flowers.

Six gardenias for her pillow.

Three orchids.

Got that straight?
- Yes, sir. Anything else?

878

Yes. You can bring me some ice water.

879

<i>Everywhere</i>.

961
01:07:18,402 --> 01:07:20,595
<i>I was obsessed by one thought only</i>.

962
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:23,261
<i>The thought of finding her</i>.

963
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,832
A mighty nice set of guns you got there.

964
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:28,799
Do you want to pawn them or sell them?
- Sell them.

965
01:07:29,631 --> 01:07:31,018
I'll give you eighty dollars.

966
01:07:34,576 --> 01:07:35,820
I got to keep this one.

967
01:07:36,305 --> 01:07:38,733
If you're breaking the set up
I'll have to give you less money.

968
01:07:38,944 --> 01:07:40,060
I'll give you sixty.

969
01:07:40,919 --> 01:07:41,827
I'll take it.

970
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:58,932
I never figured a smart guy like you
would let a dame make a sucker of him.

971
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:02,363
I don't even know whether
she's dead or alive.

972
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:05,139
She is alive alright.
Her kind never dies.

973
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:07,952
Then why can't I find her?

974
01:08:08,163 --> 01:08:10,472
Because you don't know what
you're looking for. That's why.

975
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:13,428
I don't know why I
should help you but ..

976
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:14,688
Here it is.

977
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,658
Remember a bicycle act that was on the
bill when we played in San Francisco?

978
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,828
The Wheel ..?
- The Wheelers.

979
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:28,936
I know they had trouble finding someone
to replace Eddie when he left the act.

980
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,575
The big, good-looking one.

981
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:32,326
Connie was nuts about him then.

982
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:35,698
It ain't more than a year ago
so she probably still is.

983
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:40,069
The last thing I heard about Eddie he
was some place south of the border.

984
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,427
So, if you really want to find her.

985
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,574
You'd better start hunting for him.

986
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,297
What do you want with that dame
after the way she crossed you up ..

987
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:50,967
Is something I'll never
be able to figure out.

988
01:08:55,651 --> 01:08:58,405
<i>At last I had found something
tangible to guide me</i>.

989
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:02,596
<i>I hitch-hiked my way to the
border and then I walked</i>.

990
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:07,018
<i>Finally, I got a ride on a
truck here to Mexico City</i>.

991
01:09:07,896 --> 01:09:09,576

[ Spanish language singing ]

993
01:12:26,938 --> 01:12:29,545
You were going great with that guy
in the wings tonight, weren't you.

994
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:31,741
Why honey, he's an old friend of mine.

995
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,428
And you didn't come in until
two o'clock this morning, did you?

996
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:36,923
There's such a thing as
carrying a friendship too far.

997
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,089
Why, baby. I think you are jealous.

998
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:41,349
Look.

999
01:12:41,581 --> 01:12:42,586
You're my wife.

1000
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:45,453
You're not going to get away
with this stuff. It has to stop.

1001
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:47,139
Keep away from that acrobat.

1002
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:50,041
I'll do whatever my
daddy wants me to do.

1003
01:12:50,254 --> 01:12:51,084
Listen.

1004
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,896
I don't know what happened
to Al and I don't want to know.

1005
01:12:54,548 --> 01:12:56,976
But I got a darned good idea that
isn't going to happen to me.

1006
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:58,509
You understand?

1007
01:12:59,349 --> 01:13:00,823
You talk awful big, little man.

1008
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:03,403
I'm going to pick up our check.

1009
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:05,593
I'll be back in ten minutes.
And you be here.

1010
01:13:05,826 --> 01:13:06,636
Yes, sir.

1011
01:13:07,296 --> 01:13:08,800
Will there be anything else, sir?

1012
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,135
Flamarion.

1013
01:13:55,357 --> 01:13:57,103
Yes. I have changed.

1014
01:13:58,299 --> 01:13:59,484
We both have changed.

1015
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:01,101
How did you get in?

1016
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,713
We had a date. Remember?

1017
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:06,343
I always keep my dates.

1018
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:09,890
I tried to get there.

1019
01:14:10,474 --> 01:14:13,077
Three months weren't long enough
to see your mother in Minnesota?

1020
01:14:13,873 --> 01:14:16,631
You were so busy at home
at that phoney address.

1021
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,710
That's it. It was too long.

1022
01:14:19,335 --> 01:14:21,405
I was wrong to marry. All wrong.
I know that now.

1023
01:14:22,784 --> 01:14:25,091
I waited for you.
And then Eddie came along.

1024
01:14:25,673 --> 01:14:27,595
But I never stopped
thinking about you. Never.

1025
01:14:27,873 --> 01:14:29,922
I know how it is. You haunted me too.

1026
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:33,061
Every minute you were away
from me made me more unhappy.

1027
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,047
I am so glad you've come.

1028
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,552
That's why I am here.

1029
01:14:38,115 --> 01:14:39,321
I have come to get you.

1030
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:42,284
Of course.

1031
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:44,432
It was different before.

1032
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:47,488
Fine hotels. Nothing but the best.

1033
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:49,967
We'll have it all again.
Just the two of us.

1034
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,203
It will be just like it used to be.

1035
01:14:52,414 --> 01:14:53,858
We'll have our future together.

1036
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:56,124
Just as you had planned.

1037
01:14:56,407 --> 01:14:57,096
Yes.

1038
01:14:57,469 --> 01:14:59,301
We'll go back to the States.
Get a new act.

1039
01:14:59,849 --> 01:15:02,122
You'll be a headliner.
Your name will be in lights again.

1040
01:15:04,757 --> 01:15:06,143
And you will be my assistant?

1041
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,539
Of course.

1042
01:15:09,388 --> 01:15:10,929
Then I'll have everything.

1043
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:11,920
Yes.

1044
01:15:12,452 --> 01:15:13,569
Everything you want.

1045
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:15,074
And so will I.

1046
01:15:15,828 --> 01:15:16,980
We will go away.

1047
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:19,466
You don't belong here, Connie.

1048
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:25,652
We.

1049
01:15:26,241 --> 01:15:27,913
We do understand each other. Don't we?

1050
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,460
Yes. I understand.

1051
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:34,960
But this is one time you
will keep your date.

1052
01:15:35,423 --> 01:15:36,331
You wouldn't.

1053
01:15:36,652 --> 01:15:38,483
You couldn't.
- I'm through and so are you.

1054
01:15:38,764 --> 01:15:41,082
No. Think. I'll never squeal. Ever.

1055
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:43,124
That is right.
- Look.

1056
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,514
Just let me go.
I'll give you back all the money.

1057
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:48,136
You won't need any now.
- You wouldn't dare.

1058
01:15:48,826 --> 01:15:51,463
I'll tell them you killed my husband.
I'll say that you're a murderer.

1059
01:15:51,818 --> 01:15:52,875
Then what are you?

1060
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:55,704
I'm the last man you'll ever cheat.

1061
01:15:57,328 --> 01:15:58,815
Why, you poor sucker.

1062
01:15:59,683 --> 01:16:00,979
How could anyone love you?

1063
01:16:01,749 --> 01:16:04,244
A fat bull neck. Those squinty eyes.

1064
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:06,307
You are old. You're ugly.

1065
01:16:07,007 --> 01:16:08,608
Even the touch of you made me sick.

1066
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:11,304
I hated you and I've always hated you.

1067
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:15,006
That was your curtain speech, Connie.

1068
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:16,415
Keep away from me.

1069
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:17,963
Keep away from me.

1070

[ Connie screams! ]

Who screamed?

1073
01:16:42,872 --> 01:16:44,364
I held on as ..

1074
01:16:45,113 --> 01:16:46,351
As long as I could.

1075
01:16:47,622 --> 01:16:48,947
Until the lights went out.

1076
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:51,588
Everybody had gone.

1077
01:16:53,511 --> 01:16:55,504
All the time I was growing weaker.

1078
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,156
Loss of blood.

1079
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,054
Then I let go.

1080
01:17:03,673 --> 01:17:04,492
Tell them.

1081
01:17:07,828 --> 01:17:09,422
It's the police, Flamarion.

1082
01:17:09,902 --> 01:17:12,266
I said I was going to be dead ..
