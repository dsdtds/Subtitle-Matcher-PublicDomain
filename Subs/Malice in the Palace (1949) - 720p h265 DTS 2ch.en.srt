00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,257
Just past the hour.

3
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,594
I wonder what delays
Affah Dollah.

4
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,630
Fear not, most illustrious
Hassan Ben Sober.

5
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:14,334
Fear not. Affah Dollah will
get the map by hook or crook,

6
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,603
as sure as my name
is Ghinna Rumma.

7
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,059
Quite so.

8
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:25,511
Service.
How about a little service?

9
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:28,948
- Comin' up here. Yes, sir.
- Comin' up.

10
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,017
Yes, sir, we have
all the service.

11
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,119
At your service.

12
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,720
Whew.
Boy, if I hadn't ducked,

13
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,188
we'd have collided sure.

14
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,012
What a narrow escape.

15
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,278
What? Wh...?

16
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,456
What's the matter with you?

17
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:52,071
Take this off.

18
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,890
Take this off!

19
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,026
Now, take it easy.

20
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,062
We'll have you all fixed up
in a minute. What's this?

21
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,086
Oh, happy birthday.

22
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,385
Hold this.

23
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,986
Just a minute.
I'll take it right off.

24
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,789
I would leave it on.

25
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,333
People don't know if you're
comin' or goin' with this on.

26
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,512
There you are, sir.
You look very pretty.

27
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,348
And the spaghetti
is as good as new.

28
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,917
Why, you...

29
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,219
Moe. Wh...?

30
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,121
Dog of dogs, how dare you?

31
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,457
A thousand pardons.
It was unavoidable.

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,758
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,760
This would degrade you.

34
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,062
'Tis true.
I am an aristocrat.

35
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,231
I am Hassan Ben Sober.

36
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,699
I had a few too many myself.

37
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,558
Quiet.
We gotta clean up this mess.

38
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,280
Why, you...

39
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,281
Ooh! Oh!

40
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,204
Get busy.

41
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,187
What are you doin'?

42
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,688
Stop it, will you?

43
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,113
Oh, cut it out.

44
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,716
- We'll travel by night.
- Perhaps if Affah Dollah...

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,418
Greetings, greetings.

46
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,086
Did you bring the map,
Affah Dollah?

47
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,304
Aye, chief.

48
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:15,638
But as I slit his throat...

49
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,774
with his dying breath,

50
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,942
he said someone else
had a duplicate map.

51
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,512
'Tis bad. We must leave at once
if we are to be the first

52
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,781
to reach
King Rootin'-Tootin's tomb.

53
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,816
Make preparations
to depart immediately.

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,419
Aye, chief,
but remember the curse:

55
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,220
He who touches the jewel first

56
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,357
is doomed to a thousand deaths.

57
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,258
We must secure
the services of three,

58
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,860
and when we get them
to do our bidding:

59
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,596
Yes, but we'd best have food

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,831
before we travel.

61
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,832
Aye.
Service.

62
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,834
Waiters.
Service.

63
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,202
Here we are.
At your service.

64
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,537
Oh! Ooh.

65
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,638
What'll you have?

66
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,206
We want...
We don't have any more.

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,874
All we got left
is rabbit and hot dogs.

68
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,509
Rabbit.
Hot dog.

69
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,944
Hot dog, they'll take rabbit.

70
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,078
Okay, comin' up.

71
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,848
Comin' right up.
Comin' right up.

72
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,406
Here we are:
pepper and salt.

73
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,478
That busboy's off.

74
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:27,849
Scat!

75
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,283
Come here.

76
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,584
Come here, you.

77
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,820
- We'll have to fix you.
- Why, you...

78
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,821
Here.

79
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh.

80
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,134
Catsup.

81
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,459
Cat... Aah!

82
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,449
Get outta here.

83
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,982
Come here, you.

84
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,516
Ah, you think
you'll get away, eh?

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,320
Now I got you.
Come on. Now I got...

86
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,165
It couldn't be.
Or could it?

87
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,133
Now, you stay here
and you be a good boy, you.

88
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,590
Now, sit there.

89
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,688
Here you are, gentlemen.

90
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:37,590
Hot dogs.
When it comes to cookin',

91
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:38,992
I'm the cat's meow.

92
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,365
Sit down.

93
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,567
Oh, but I'm not tired.
I'll just stand while you eat.

94
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,770
Sit down
with your head on or off.

95
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,445
Y-You talked us into it.

96
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,154
Eat!

97
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,285
Did you hear anything?

98
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,142
Yeah, I did.

99
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,844
Sit down and eat.
Eat.

100
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,388
Eat.
Eat.

101
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,739
Gesundheit.

102
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,037
Eat!

103
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:57,292
Well?

104
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:02,331
Whoa!

105
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,080
I killed it.
I killed it.

106
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,182
Oh, I killed it.

107
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:13,358
Shh.
This just can't be.

108
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,038
Forgot the mustard.

109
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,273
So you are the perpetrator
of this.

110
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,442
Sit down and eat.
Sit down.

111
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:39,200
A pleasure. Thank you.

112
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,487
Mm-mm-mm.

113
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,714
Mm.

114
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,074
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

115
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,469
There's the dog and cat.
Why didn't you tell me?

116
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,470
What?
Shut up.

117
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,471
Let him alone.

118
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,040
You too.
Oh, cut it... Oof.

119
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,041
Come here.

120
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,642
Oh!
Oh!

121
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,129
There. Oof.
Ooh!

122
00:09:31,688 --> 00:09:34,834
These three, they are the ones
to get the jewel for us.

123
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:35,858
Right.

124
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,021
Gentlemen.

125
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,523
Who came in?

126
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,891
No, you.

127
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,028
How would you boys like to
make a thousand shilbleenas?

128
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,162
Here.

129
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,163
You've convinced us.

130
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,431
What do we have to do?

131
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,833
There is a diamond
worth a king's ransom.

132
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,668
Do you hear? A king's ransom.

133
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,421
Gentlemen, this map will lead us
to the treasure.

134
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:56,739
Now, pay strict attention.

135
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,873
Huh?

136
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,141
Oh. Ruined. Defeated.

137
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,209
That murderous cutthroat.

138
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,563
He has the famous
100-carat diamond.

139
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,365
A hundred carats?
He sure knew his onions.

140
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,517
Quiet.

141
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,286
This map is useless to me now.

142
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,355
With that diamond,
I could have quit my job

143
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,957
as the doorman
at the Oasis Hotel.

144
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,528
Hey, spinach chin.

145
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,664
Do you mean to tell me
you're only a doorman?

146
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:38,731
Yes.

147
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,233
Well, there's the door, man.

148
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,206
Will you give me 5 for this?

149
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,340
No, but I'll give you two.

150
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:49,341
I'll take it.

151
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:50,799
Get out.

152
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,816
Hey. There's only one
100-carat diamond,

153
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,651
and it comes
from Rootin'-Tootin's tomb.

154
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,985
That's government property.

155
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,588
Right, and if we return it,
we'll get a big reward.

156
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,923
Yeah, maybe 50,000 bucks.

157
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,392
Boy, with that kind of money,

158
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,494
we could rent a one-room
apartment in Hollywood.

159
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:09,595
Maybe.

160
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,196
But that Emir of Shmow
is a cutthroat.

161
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,598
Suppose he cuts my throat?

162
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,166
Well?
Well?

163
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,535
Now, don't worry.
We'll be disguised.

164
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,571
We'll find the shortest way.

165
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,795
Now, here.
Study this map closely.

166
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:03,248
We start here at Jerkola,

167
00:12:03,272 --> 00:12:04,784
down the Inseine River,

168
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,318
over the Giva Dam,

169
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:07,319
through Pushover,

170
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:08,854
across Shmowland,

171
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:12,212
to the stronghold of Shmow.

172
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,719
Pass.

173
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:27,807
Giddyap. Giddyap.

174
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,475
Whoa.

175
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,509
Halt. Who goes there?

176
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,543
Santa Claus.

177
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,911
Oh, there ain't no Santa Claus.

178
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:34,880
Oh, yes, there is,
and we got a present for you.

179
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,215
You have?
Right here.

180
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,576
Okay, boys, come on.

181
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,449
The coast is clear.
Come on.

182
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,005
Hike.

183
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,542
Come on.

184
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,496
Okay, let's find the diamond.

185
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:27,099
It's the Shmow.
Let's go.

186
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,260
There he is,
and he's wearin' the diamond.

187
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,545
Now is our chance to get it.

188
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,569
Yeah.

189
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,559
Fee, fi, fo, fum.

190
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm the evil spirit that guards
the Rootin'-Tootin' diamond.

191
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,850
Give it to me
lest evil befall you.

192
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,407
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

193
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,725
The spirit commands you
to stand on your head

194
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,578
in that lily pond
until further notice.

195
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,671
Uh-oh. Hide quick.
Somebody's comin'.

196
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,927
Moe, scram.

197
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,720
Whoa!

198
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,143
Whoa.

199
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,115
Here. Hold this.

200
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,500
I'll kill you!

201
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,620
I'll kill...

202
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,860
Gotcha. Bull's eye.

203
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,046
Why, you...

204
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:07,934
Your hat.

205
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,035
Thank you.

206
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:10,519
You're welcome.

207
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,783
Why...

208
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,941
Well, that's that.

209
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,335
Get up here.

210
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,893
Hey, the Shmow is flooded.

211
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:54,713
Sister, it looks like
you're out of a job.

212
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,615
Ha-ha-ha.
Where's that diamond, kid?

213
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Hey! Hey!

214
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:59,323
