1
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,919
Hey, Joe, drag your foot, boy.
Look what we got here.

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,688
Hey, you wanna drag, huh?

3
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,565
Sure.

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,194
Come on, man. Get ready.

5
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,250
I'll show 'em how to drive. Just watch me.

6
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,663
Sir, as high as this river is right now,

7
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,041
and with all the mud and sand
it's carryin',

8
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,576
they may never find that car.

9
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,821
Uh-uh.

10
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,387
Right there.

11
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,890
All right, let's hear your story
about how it happened.

12
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,143
- It wasn't our fault, sir.
- Yeah?

13
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,939
We were the first ones on the bridge,
and coming a-along following the tracks,

14
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,902
and they wanted to get around us,
I guess, and they lost control...

15
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,130
You sure you didn't crowd 'em off?

16
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,942
Three hours.

17
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,587
Yeah? Not sure I wanna find that car now.

18
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,757
With this sand and with that current,
we may never find 'em.

19
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,781
About all I guess
we can do is keep tryin'.

20
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,501
Look.

21
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,855
Come on. Let's get down there.

22
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,120
Why, it's Mary Henry.

23
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,272
Are you all right?

24
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,715
How'd you get out?

25
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,426
Here, put this on.
We'd better get you back to town.

26
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,391
What about the other girls?

27
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,518
I don't remember.

28
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,987
Is this like the one
I'll be playing in Utah?

29
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,697
It's quite similar.

30
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,700
I supervised the installation myself.

31
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,077
The accident won't delay
your going, will it?

32
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,830
No. I'm leaving this morning.

33
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,524
- There's nothing I can do here.
- That's right.

34
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,128
Well, Mary, you'll make
a fine organist for that church.

35
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,172
Be very satisfying to you, I think.

36
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,090
It's just a job to me.

37
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,802
Well, that's not quite the attitude
for going into church work.

38
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,764
I'm not taking the vows.
I'm only going to play the organ.

39
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,141
Oh, you want more than that.

40
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,587
Of course it doesn't pay much,
but, well, at least it's a start.

41
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,757
Are you driving by Benton
to see your folks?

42
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,235
No, I can't. I... I must hurry.

43
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,464
I... I've got to leave.
I'm going to drive straight through.

44
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:12,786
Mary, it takes more than intellect
to be a musician.

45
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,265
Put your soul into it a little, okay?

46
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,481
Good luck, Mary.

47
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,717
Stop by and see us
the next time you're in.

48
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,661
Thank you, but I'm never coming back.

49
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,295
Can I help you?

50
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,648
- Fill it up.
- All right.

51
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,267
Be anything else, lady?

52
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:07,497
Could you tell me what that big structure
is back a few miles by the lake?

53
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,115
Oh, you mean the old bathhouse.

54
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,211
Yeah, that used to be
a pretty ritzy place in the old days.

55
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,673
Then the lake went down
and they made a dance hall out of it.

56
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,841
Then they put those buildings up out there

57
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,844
and made some sort of
a carnival there for a while.

58
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,807
Ah, that's years ago though.
Just stands out there now.

59
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,284
I see.

60
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,208
Uh, I have an address here of
a rooming house. Could you direct me?

61
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,803
Oh, sure. Why, that's just
right over here a little way.

62
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,227
Been savin' it for you
since I got your letter.

63
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,461
Could've rented it yesterday
if I'd wanted.

64
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,590
Oh, it... it's fine.
I-It's just about what I expected.

65
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,488
I knew you'd like it.

66
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,138
This ain't no regular
roomin' house, you know.

67
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:09,414
I only got you
and Mr. Linden across the hall.

68
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,255
Each room's got its own
private bathroom too.

69
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,740
You can take all the baths you want.

70
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,576
I'm not one to fuss
about things like that.

71
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,895
Thank you.
I think I'll be quite comfortable.

72
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,081
Well, hope you'll stay a while.

73
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,001
I'm downstairs
in the back part of the house,

74
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:40,232
so if there's anything else you need,
guess it'll have to wait till morning.

75
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,720
Night.

76
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,663
Good night, Mrs. Thomas.

77
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,433
And this, Miss Henry,
is our pride and joy.

78
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,661
This was made in the same town
where I've been studying.

79
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,997
Of course.
That's where we heard about you.

80
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,333
You have found a place to stay?

81
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,836
- Yes, I have a room.
- Good.

82
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,672
Well, we hope
you're going to like it here.

83
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,258
We're not the largest church
in this area, of course,

84
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,220
but we have a nice congregation.

85
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,765
We'll have to have some sort of reception.
They'll want to meet you.

86
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,352
- Couldn't we just skip that?
- Skip that?

87
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,480
I don't suppose
it's an absolute necessity.

88
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,608
I don't know what
some of the ladies will say.

89
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,903
If they say I'm a fine organist,
that should be enough, shouldn't it?

90
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,698
Well, yes, of course.

91
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,993
We'll let it go at that
for the time being.

92
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,704
But, my dear,

93
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:39,184
you cannot live in isolation
from the human race, you know.

94
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,021
- Mind if I try this now?
- I want you to.

95
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,068
You go right ahead.

96
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,547
I'll be next door at the manse,
if you need me.

97
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,821
We have an organist
capable of stirring the soul.

98
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,628
What do you see?

99
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,902
Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all.

100
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,655
I've practiced all afternoon
and it's gotten me in a mood.

101
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,240
You need some fresh air.

102
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,076
I've got to make a call out past the lake.

103
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,620
Would you like to come along for the ride?

104
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,623
- You know that old pavilion out there?
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,750
- Will we pass it?
- Go right by it.

106
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,962
- Stop and look at it if you like.
- I would, with you along.

107
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,234
Good.

108
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,543
This used to be quite a place.

109
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,088
- It's been deserted for a long time now.
- Will you take me in?

110
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,134
Goodness no.
It isn't safe out there anymore.

111
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,261
That's why they put up this barrier.

112
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,409
Be very easy to step around it.

113
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,310
What attraction could
there be for you out there?

114
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,645
I'm not sure.

115
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,544
I'm a reasonable person. I don't know.

116
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,941
Maybe I want to satisfy myself

117
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,045
that the place is nothing more
than it appears to be.

118
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,822
- Would you take me out there?
- No.

119
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,075
The law has placed it off-limits.

120
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,787
Wouldn't be very seemly for
a minister to break the law, would it?

121
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,608
No. Maybe I can come back some other time.

122
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,228
Shall we go along now?

123
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,698
Ah, I thought that'd be you.

124
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,141
Good evening.

125
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,787
That organ playin' must take a long time.
You've been gone most the whole day.

126
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:51,127
I went for a long drive in the country
with my new boss, an elderly minister.

127
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,295
Oh, ho.

128
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,898
That must have been a kick in the head.

129
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,453
I learned that
from my other boarder, Mr. Linden.

130
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,847
Did you get your supper?

131
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,182
Oh, I forgot.

132
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,768
Well, this ain't no boardinghouse,

133
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,147
but I got some coffee
and sandwich makings left.

134
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,649
I could bring you some up after a while.

135
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,319
Good. I'll be taking one of those baths
you're so generous with.

136
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,988
Take as many as you want.

137
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,262
I ain't one to make a fuss
about a thing like that.

138
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,307
Come in, Mrs. Thomas.

139
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,564
Oh, uh, just a minute.

140
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,424
I thought you were Mrs. Thomas!

141
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,719
Yeah, I, uh...
I wondered when you asked me in.

142
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,531
I'm John Linden.
I'm your neighbor across the hall.

143
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,408
- Nice to meet you. Would you excuse...
- Hey, I, uh...

144
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,307
- I was just wondering...
- Just stand right there.

145
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,315
I forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Mary Henry.

146
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,109
Yeah, I know.

147
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:24,321
I, uh... I heard you tell Mrs. Thomas
you haven't ate anything yet, huh?

148
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:28,909
I just thought, bein' neighborly and all...
I haven't eaten anything either.

149
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,954
I just thought I'd ask you out to dinner.

150
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,789
That's very thoughtful,
but I can't accept.

151
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,876
I know we haven't met or anything yet,
but I just thought...

152
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,211
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.

153
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,424
Look, there's a real nice restaurant
right down the street, and I thought...

154
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,385
I'm the kind of guy
who doesn't like to eat by himself.

155
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,988
I've made arrangements
to eat in my room tonight.

156
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:53,076
Hey, if, uh, you change your mind,
just holler.

157
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,747
Looks kind of lonesome in here.

158
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,924
Good night, Mr. Linden.

159
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,734
Miss Henry?

160
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,507
It's Mrs. Thomas.

161
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,766
Hmm.

162
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,608
Who's the man in the hall?

163
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,864
The...

164
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:56,432
Oh, you must mean Mr. Linden.

165
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,101
He has the room across the hall.

166
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:02,455
No. I mean the other one.

167
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,465
There is no other.

168
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,194
Me and you and Mr. Linden.

169
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,822
Us three is all there is in this house.

170
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,220
B-But you must have passed him out there.

171
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,390
You're needin' this food.

172
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,915
Goin' without eatin'
makes you jumpy sometimes.

173
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,960
Maybe you heard
the boards pop or somethin'.

174
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,463
These old houses
creak worse than my knees.

175
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,568
I didn't hear him, Mrs. Thomas. I saw him.

176
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,242
Now, don't talk that way.

177
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,909
I don't sleep so good as it is.

178
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,937
It's these old houses. They...

179
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:48,008
They're big enough so that
you could hide a man in every corner.

180
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,323
You just gotta not let
your imagination run away with you.

181
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,926
- Are you going out there?
- Well, of course.

182
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,866
There's nobody there.

183
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,505
Now you just go
and eat that sandwich I made for you.

184
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,360
Don't drink the coffee
if coffee keeps you awake.

185
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,837
It won't.

186
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,642
Coffee never keeps me awake.

187
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,222
Well, good morning.

188
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,038
I heard your alarm. I knew you'd be up.

189
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,373
- Guess what I got.
- I can't imagine.

190
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,710
Oh, just what it takes
to start the day off right.

191
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,339
I make it in my room.
It saves me havin' to get dressed up.

192
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,592
I guess I had to get dressed
to come over here anyway.

193
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,802
Oh! It looks just like what I need.

194
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,748
Well, then two cups of coffee comin' up.

195
00:30:28,118 --> 00:30:29,711
Say, uh,

196
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,441
I guess you took it wrong last night
about me comin' to your door and all.

197
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,486
I'm not a very sociable person ordinarily.

198
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,821
How can I resist an inducement like this?

199
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,406
A what?

200
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,659
Come on. I don't know all those big words.

201
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,787
I'm just an ordinary guy
who works in a warehouse, that's all.

202
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:49,748
I make pretty good money though. Hey.

203
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,519
I got a couple of shots left over from
last night. Want a little bit in yours?

204
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:57,756
No, thanks. It's not the recommended
breakfast for a church organist.

205
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,675
Oh, is that what you do?

206
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,386
You mean they pay somebody
to play the organ in church?

207
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,363
Some churches do.

208
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,266
Hey, I hope you don't mind about this.

209
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,518
I just didn't know
you were a church woman.

210
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,437
To me a church is just
a place of business.

211
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,649
- Well, that's a funny way to look at it.
- Why?

212
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,360
People seem shocked because
I took a job in a church,

213
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,321
and I regard it simply as a job.

214
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,283
I'm a professional organist
and I play for pay, that's all.

215
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,228
Thinkin' like that,
don't that give you nightmares?

216
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,894
Strange you should say that.

217
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,794
As a matter of fact...
not for that reason, mind you...

218
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,673
but I had
the strangest feeling last night.

219
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:43,093
Yeah, I had kind of a lost night myself.

220
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,991
That's funny.

221
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,832
The world is so different in the daylight.

222
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:53,378
But in the dark,
your fantasies get so out of hand.

223
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,758
But in the daylight,
everything falls back into place again.

224
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,712
Let's have no more nights.

225
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:06,009
Or let's make them more interesting, huh?

226
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,579
Say, how'd you get to be
a church organist?

227
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,581
I studied it in college.

228
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,308
I could've gone to college.

229
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,585
I used to play pretty good football,

230
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,588
but they wanted me
to take a lot of classes and things.

231
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,568
- They're that way.
- I'm just as smart as the next guy.

232
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,845
But I just didn't dig
what they were teachin' in school.

233
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,183
And the thing I hated most
was "principal products."

234
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,601
Principal products?

235
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:37,047
You know, like, uh,
"The principal products of Brazil are..."

236
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,549
Oh, geez.

237
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,303
Coffee beans, snake oil.
You know, like that.

238
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:46,073
When I was in school,
I couldn't care less.

239
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,283
The only thing I cared about was girls.

240
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,027
Didn't they offer a course in that?

241
00:32:51,127 --> 00:32:53,971
If they would've done that,
I would've graduated.

242
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,518
What's the matter?
Can you still taste the coffee?

243
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:01,096
Come on.
What do you think, I'm an alcoholic?

244
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,257
I just like to start the day off
in a good mood, that's all.

245
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,718
You must be hilarious by noon.

246
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,039
I'm just the kind of a guy employers want.
You know, the happy worker.

247
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,810
Come on.
Didn't I make your morning happier?

248
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,562
This morning you're exactly what I needed.

249
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,417
You're gonna need me in the evenin' too.
You just don't know it yet.

250
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,819
I'll rinse off these cups.

251
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,173
Ah, no, no.
Just spoils the flavor for tomorrow.

252
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,258
Well, thank you for the coffee.

253
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,827
It was unsanitary, but delicious.

254
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:36,524
Well, uh, should've put some of
the germ killer inside.

255
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,335
Well, I hate to leave so early.

256
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,984
Think you can get through the door?

257
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,340
You got the wrong impression of me.

258
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,301
Well, I meant because
you have so many things to carry.

259
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,347
Oh. Like I said, I hate to leave.

260
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:56,143
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Linden,
but I'm sure you have to get to work.

261
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,477
- Don't you?
- Nope.

262
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,501
I have the whole day free for shopping.

263
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:14,035
Does the hem hang right in back?

264
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,204
We might change the hemline a little.

265
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,165
The drape is just fine.

266
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,041
Otherwise it looks very nice.

267
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,254
I'm sure it isn't very chic to take
the second dress, but I like it.

268
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,949
We alter it a little here
to make it straight all the way around.

269
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,823
Do you want to go back
to your dressing room?

270
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,863
I like it fine. I believe I'll have you
deliver the dress, if you don't mind.

271
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,370
I did say I'd take it.

272
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,883
What's the matter with her?

273
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,473
What's the matter with everyone?

274
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,902
Why don't they answer me?

275
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,031
- What is it?
- That man!

276
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,320
I didn't mean any harm.
I just stopped to get a drink.

277
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,490
No. No.

278
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,342
It was that man.

279
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,311
That man!

280
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,374
There was someone else there!

281
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,459
That strange man was there!

282
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,461
Now, look. You've had a fright.

283
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,965
Hysteria won't solve anything.
Now control yourself.

284
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,592
Look, I'm Dr. Samuels.

285
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,637
My office is right across
the street there.

286
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,364
You've had a shock.

287
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,684
If you would like my assistance,
I'll be glad to offer it.

288
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,310
Thank you.

289
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,629
- Could I come with you now?
- Certainly.

290
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,417
I'll take her over to my office.
We'll see that she's all right.

291
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,670
My purse.

292
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,484
It was more than just
not being able to hear anything,

293
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,730
or make contact with anyone.

294
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,781
It was as though...

295
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,741
as though for a time I didn't exist.

296
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,741
As though I had no place in the world,

297
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,286
no part of the life around me.

298
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,920
And then you saw this... this man?

299
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,880
Yes.

300
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,365
You'll excuse my back, but I wanted
to get some of that written down.

301
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,701
I must have been talking for an hour.

302
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,271
Anything else?
Anything you haven't told me?

303
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,083
That's all there is.
That's the whole story.

304
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,753
He's been following me.
That's all there is to it.

305
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,447
It isn't that simple though, is it?

306
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:00,965
What do you mean?

307
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,218
He couldn't have been
in the park this afternoon,

308
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,220
or one of us men would've seen him.

309
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,788
And that night in the hallway,

310
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:11,100
you said yourself the landlady came up
a minute later, and she didn't see him?

311
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,769
What are you driving at?

312
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,940
It's been less than a week since you
were in a car that crashed into the river.

313
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,692
How you got out of that
no one seems to know.

314
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,654
But that experience must have been
a serious emotional shock.

315
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,865
You think I imagined all of it, don't you?
You think I'm insane?

316
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,243
I didn't say that. I don't mean that.

317
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,287
I'm a competent person.
If anything, I'm a realist.

318
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,581
I'm not given to imagining anything.

319
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,583
Hogwash.

320
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,044
All of us imagine things.

321
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,547
Have you ever heard two men
talking behind your back

322
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,820
and imagined they were talking about you?

323
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,927
Have you never imagined
you saw someone you knew,

324
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,930
and walked up to them and found
they were a perfect stranger?

325
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,350
- I don't see what this has to do with it.
- The point is this.

326
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,269
Our imaginations play tricks on us.

327
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,106
They often misinterpret
what we see and hear. Do you agree?

328
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,149
I suppose so.

329
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:04,028
If that can happen in ordinary times,
go a step further.

330
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,491
Look what can happen in a high fever,
or following a serious emotional shock.

331
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,287
It doesn't seem possible
that I could have imagined all of it.

332
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:16,124
Does this man, this figure,
resemble anyone you've ever known?

333
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,418
- An acquaintance, or your father?
- No.

334
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:22,589
- Have a boyfriend here or back home?
- No, no desire for one.

335
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,987
- Never?
- No.

336
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,722
I'm surprised to find myself
saying that, but it's true.

337
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,309
I have no desire for
the close company of other people.

338
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,582
Have you always felt this way?

339
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,315
I... I don't know.

340
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,318
Don't you want to join
in the things that other people do,

341
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,111
share the experiences of other people?

342
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,573
I don't seem capable
of being very close to people.

343
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,702
I do feel that perhaps I'm trying
to reach out for those other things.

344
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,021
Do you feel guilty wanting them?

345
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,041
I don't understand you.

346
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:01,961
I'm not a psychiatrist, and perhaps
I'm being clumsy at all this,

347
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,673
but I am suggesting that perhaps
this figure represents a guilt feeling.

348
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,491
Oh, that's ridiculous!

349
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,786
Maybe. Frankly, I don't know.

350
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,057
Well, I know one thing.

351
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:18,519
If my imagination is playing tricks on me,
I'm going to put a stop to it.

352
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,481
You're a very strong-willed person,
aren't you?

353
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,629
I survive, if that's what you mean.

354
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,362
That old pavilion out by the lake.

355
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,306
Somehow you associate it
with all this, don't you?

356
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,140
I could go out there.
I could put an end to that too.

357
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,978
- I could go out there...
- Now don't be hasty.

358
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:44,045
If it is all in my imagination,
I could put a stop to it.

359
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,006
Maybe. But at least someone
should be with you. I can't possibly...

360
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,110
As you say, Doctor,
I'm a person of strong will.

361
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,304
And the time to go out there is now.

362
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,908
And if I have to, I can go alone.

363
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,313
Say, uh,

364
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,758
I don't wanna get turned down again.

365
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,386
I was thinkin'
of askin' you out to dinner.

366
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,846
I stopped for a bite to eat on the way.

367
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,684
Anyway, I have to practice
at the church this evening.

368
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,144
Look, uh, how's about if
I pick you up afterward?

369
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,064
We'll go someplace and dance or somethin'.

370
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,088
I'm sorry. I'm not much for dancing.

371
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,254
Uh, hey, uh,

372
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,116
you mind if I ask you a question?

373
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,201
I won't know until I hear it.

374
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,036
What, are you afraid of men?

375
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,622
No, I'm not afraid of men.

376
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,647
Well, you seem sort of cold.

377
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,880
This morning when I brought you
the coffee, you were friendly.

378
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,028
This morning I needed company.

379
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,695
Well, maybe you'll need company tonight.

380
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,748
It's better than walkin' home alone.

381
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,998
Yes, it is.

382
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,063
I should be finished around 9:00.

383
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,042
- Will that be all right?
- That's okay by me.

384
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:44,280
Say, uh, I'll see you in church, huh?

385
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,446
Profane! Sacrilege!

386
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,324
What are you playing in this church?

387
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:19,395
Have you no respect?
Do you feel no reverence?

388
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:24,734
Then I feel sorry for you
and your lack of soul.

389
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,836
This organ, the music of this church,

390
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,298
these things have meaning
and significance to us.

391
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,821
I assumed they did to you.

392
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,762
But without this awareness,

393
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,332
I'm afraid you cannot be our organist.

394
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:44,083
In conscience, I must ask you to resign.

395
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,088
That does not mean
that I am abandoning you,

396
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,340
nor should you turn
your back on the church.

397
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,614
There is help here,
and I urge you to accept it.

398
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,460
Well, hi there. I've been waitin'
an awful long time for you.

399
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,212
My car's over there.
I know the right place to go.

400
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,491
What's the matter? Don't you drink either?

401
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,410
- Not really.
- Not really.

402
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,730
How else is there if you don't
drink really? Answer me that, hmm?

403
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:33,146
Now me, I not only drink really,
I really drink.

404
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,637
What's the matter?
Don't you like the music either?

405
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,098
- I like it fine.
- You don't like it.

406
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:48,727
You don't like to dance,
and you don't like to drink.

407
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,147
You don't like for a man
to hold you close. That's it, isn't it?

408
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,922
- I didn't say that.
- You haven't said anything all evening.

409
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:02,675
Why don't I go play that song again,
you like it so much.

410
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,999
Hey, Johnny, who's the doll?

411
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,626
Nobody you know, Chip.

412
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,170
Oh, come on now.
You been holdin' out on me.

413
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,632
That's not the kind of pig
you usually drag around.

414
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,010
You quit lickin' your chops.
She's outta your class.

415
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,657
You wanna bet?

416
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,331
Lay off, huh?

417
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,686
- I got somethin' on the stove there, man.
- I'll help you put it over.

418
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:34,165
I don't want her to think
I even know creeps like you.

419
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,376
Good luck.

420
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,490
Meet someone you know?

421
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,887
Yeah.

422
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,645
He's a... college fella.

423
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:53,647
He told me about this girl
that's been wantin' to meet me.

424
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,672
- Wanted me to meet her.
- What'd you tell him?

425
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,026
I said, how could I?
You're my date, you know.

426
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:10,934
Said you, uh, didn't seem
to enjoy my company much.

427
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,061
Oh, that's not true.

428
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,523
I really appreciate
you taking me out this evening.

429
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,217
I'd had a miserable night if you hadn't.

430
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:24,056
Ah. Forget it. Come on, here.
Join the party. Drink up.

431
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,123
I paid good money for that stuff.
It ain't poison.

432
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,772
I'm sorry if I annoy you.

433
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,421
You know, I don't get you.

434
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:43,091
First you stand me off.
Well, that's okay. That's class.

435
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,660
Figure you got somethin',
you're just holdin' back.

436
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,327
Now everything I say is okay.
You're a mouse.

437
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,326
Yesterday I didn't care.

438
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,229
Tonight I wanna be with you.

439
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,689
With me, or just with anybody?

440
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,086
With you.

441
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,263
Why don't you thaw out, hmm?

442
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:15,274
- You wanna be alone. I'll leave you alone.
- No, I don't. No, I...

443
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,519
I like being with you, really I do.

444
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,317
I don't want to be alone tonight.

445
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,698
I want to be near you.

446
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,331
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

447
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,215
Why don't you and me get outta here, huh?

448
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:52,057
You know, my room's only
a couple of feet from yours.

449
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,848
Ain't likely to get
very far from me, are ya?

450
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:17,519
- Oh, geez.
- Shh!

451
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,564
- You'll wake Mrs. Thomas.
- Ah, that old girl lives in the back.

452
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:23,117
She won't hear nothin'.

453
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,097
Honey...

454
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,974
You don't wanna go in there
all by yourself, do you?

455
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,520
It's dark, and it's lonely in there.

456
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,423
You don't have to be alone tonight.

457
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,153
Just let me come in a while.
Let me stay with you, huh?

458
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,472
Look, you don't wanna be alone, do ya?

459
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,869
No.

460
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,029
- I'm sorry, I...
- Look, look, honey.

461
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:13,851
Honey, you asked me in.
You must like me a little, huh?

462
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,918
Hey, what's the matter with you?

463
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,343
What's goin' on around here?

464
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,614
What's the matter with you?

465
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,616
That man's after me.

466
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,618
You gotta stop him! He's after me again.

467
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,996
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- You don't have to go!

468
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:02,290
Not me, sister. That's just what I need,

469
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,960
gettin' mixed up with some girl
that's off her rocker!

470
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,156
I don't wanna be left alone!

471
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,409
What'd you find out, Doctor?

472
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,336
Not very much, I'm afraid.

473
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:09,257
I am sure glad you just happened around.

474
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,904
I was gonna call somebody,
but I was afraid I'd have to pay the bill.

475
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,972
I came on purpose.

476
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:20,077
I've been thinking about her
ever since she left my office yesterday.

477
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,412
What's she been up to?

478
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:25,874
Only the devil knows that.

479
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:30,837
I heard her movin' things
all around that room all night.

480
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,340
Never heard such goings-on.

481
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,009
And she wouldn't let me
in her room this morning.

482
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,261
- She's a strange one.
- Mmm.

483
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,955
She absolutely refuses my help.

484
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,183
I can't say that I blame her.

485
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:46,561
There's something about her
that completely baffles me.

486
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:51,212
I've urged her to call upon me if she
feels she needs help, and I hope she will.

487
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,902
I can't let her stay in this house.

488
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,695
You won't have to worry about that.

489
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,656
She's determined to leave the city,

490
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,450
and she wants to get away
as soon as possible.

491
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,723
I hope she does leave.

492
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,183
I hope she can.

493
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,959
Decided to leave, did ya?

494
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,652
Where ya goin'?

495
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,536
I can't refund none of your week's rent
when you go off like that.

496
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:01,005
Sounds like your transmission.
Can you pull it up on the rack?

497
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,894
Okay, fine.

498
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,506
- Will it take long?
- Well, I have to check it first.

499
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,279
Would you like to get out?

500
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,617
- May I just sit here?
- Sure. Suit yourself.

501
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:50,219
When is the next eastbound bus?

502
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,932
When does the next bus leave?
I must get on it!

503
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,908
I want to get out of here.

504
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,199
I want to get away from here.

505
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:34,968
Eastbound bus, now loading,

506
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,975
gate nine.

507
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:45,271
Don't close it! Wait! Wait, wait!

508
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,191
Let me in. You've gotta let me in.
I gotta get on that train.

509
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:52,216
I gotta get away from here.
Please! Please!

510
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,854
You hear me. You can hear me.

511
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,652
Why can't I hear anything?

512
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,455
Will you help me? I need your help.

513
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,915
J-Just a moment, please.

514
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:50,771
Why can't anybody hear me?

515
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:44,658
I... I came to you, Doctor,

516
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:48,586
because you're my... my last hope.

517
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:53,941
I-I-If you don't help me,
I... I have to go back there.

518
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:58,296
He's... He's trying
to take me back somewhere.

519
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:04,474
Doctor, you've got to tell me what to do.

520
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,565
Her car's still over there,

521
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,019
and then there are footprints
leading up to here.

522
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,781
And then nothing.

523
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,228
Okay!

524
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:29,404
The Buick's right down there.
Bring it on up.
