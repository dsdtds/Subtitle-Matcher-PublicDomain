00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,414
- [Narrator] This
is a battlefront,

16
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:45,881
a battlefront like no other

17
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,649
in the long history
of mankind's wars.

18
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,825
This is an air front.

19
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,498
(dramatic music plays)

20
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:32,365
(dramatic music continues)

21
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:39,134
The working day begins as it
will end with the ground crews,

22
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:41,541
as much a part of the
Fortress as her wings.

23
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,275
If you are a mechanic,
you've got your own bomber.

24
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:46,546
You get attached to it,

25
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,812
but you know when your
ship goes out on a mission,

26
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,980
you may never see it again,

27
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,651
so you do your work as
well as it can be done,

28
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,252
perfectly,

29
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,454
because you wouldn't
want anything to go wrong

30
00:04:58,523 --> 00:04:59,825
that would be your fault.

31
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,030
(dramatic music continues)

32
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,007
Today the bombs will be
taken from these bomb dumps

33
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,508
somewhere in England

34
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:22,882
and delivered to specific points
in Wilhelmshaven, Germany.

35
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:27,553
(dramatic music continues)

36
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,689
To deliver them is the job
of the 8th Bomber Command.

37
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,624
Just a hauling job,

38
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,527
yet one of the most
difficult and complicated

39
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:39,231
of military operations.

40
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:44,537
(relaxed harmonica music plays)

41
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:58,584
(suspenseful music plays)

42
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,222
General purpose
demolition bombs,

43
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,059
impact velocity as high
as 750 miles an hour,

44
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,228
pierce five inches
of armor plate,

45
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,633
destroy a factory.

46
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:19,401
Briefing at 08:00.

47
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,408
Pilots, bombardiers and
navigators take their places.

48
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,241
The group commander,
Colonel Stanley Ray,

49
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,075
steps up to the target map

50
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:29,810
and for the first time you
learn where you're going.

51
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:33,749
Sometimes your face turns
white when you find out.

52
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:35,585
Sometimes the feeling
you won't come back

53
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,156
tightens your insides.

54
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,055
Not so long ago, you
were sitting like this

55
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:42,425
in a college or high
school classroom,

56
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:43,927
not listening too hard,

57
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:46,028
perhaps even a little sleepy.

58
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,500
But you listen here

59
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:51,935
and as you listen, you don't
have time to think of yourself.

60
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:53,436
Fear fades.

61
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:55,271
You concentrate on the mission,

62
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,438
type of formation,

63
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:58,941
assembly point, zero hour,

64
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,277
route to target, weather,

65
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:03,780
enemy fighters, enemy flak,

66
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,246
route back home.

67
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:07,883
If forced down in enemy
territory, destroy equipment.

68
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:09,785
If taken prisoner,
give no information.

69
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:12,157
Name, rank and serial
number, that's all.

70
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:16,496
(emotive music plays)

71
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:45,788
These are the passengers
with one-way tickets

72
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:49,459
and this is the crew
of the Memphis Belle,

73
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:53,232
324th Squadron, 91st
Heavy Bombardment Group.

74
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:56,632
Just one plane and one crew,

75
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,669
in one squadron, in one group

76
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:03,005
of one wing of one air force

77
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:06,211
out of 15 United
States Army air forces.

78
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:12,281
Well fellas, we've never had
an easy ride over there yet,

79
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,017
and today won't
be any different.

80
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:16,285
No escort except unfriendly

81
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:17,987
so keep your eyes peeled.

82
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,121
Don't get excited and yell

83
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,023
when you're talking
on the intercom.

84
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,692
Save your ammunition and
make your shots count.

85
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:26,157
Let me know what goes
on back there, Quinlan.

86
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:27,099
Yes, sir.

87
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,198
Stay on the ball, gang,

88
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,033
and she'll bring us back
like she's always done.

89
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,933
Okay, let's go.

90
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,144
They have completed
24 missions in this,

91
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:43,212
the toughest theater of air war,

92
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,681
the big league of sky fighting.

93
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,453
Their experience is priceless.

94
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:51,720
And so if the Memphis Belle
comes back this afternoon,

95
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:52,988
they will be sent to bring

96
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,890
the vital lessons
they have learned

97
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,630
to thousands of aircrew
men in training at home.

98
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,466
Home is America.

99
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:05,571
(propellers whir)

100
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:25,925
This is a battlefront like
no other in this or any war.

101
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,424
No monster armies,

102
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,260
no booming cannon,

103
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,094
only the roaring engine
sound of the bombers

104
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:36,266
pounding through the
quiet English countryside.

105
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:38,338
This is an air front.

106
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:42,508
(propellers whir)

107
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:48,814
(airplane engines growl)

108
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:15,541
(airplane engines roar)

109
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:46,539
(airplane engines
continue to roar)

110
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:18,438
(airplane engines
continue to roar)

111
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:48,531
The wheels of the Memphis
Belle leave the soil of England

112
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,969
for the 25th time.

113
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:53,335
The friendly soil of England,

114
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:56,066
with its ordered farms
and rural hamlets,

115
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,875
its country estates
surrounded by formal gardens

116
00:11:58,944 --> 00:12:00,843
and well-kept parks.

117
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,411
The England these Americans knew

118
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,984
only from the classics
they had to read in school.

119
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:08,584
The England of the
towns and cities

120
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,754
whose people have defended
their island's freedom

121
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,492
for over 1,000 years.

122
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,926
But today their
countryside has changed.

123
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,062
Today their island
has been converted

124
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,264
into a gigantic bomber field,

125
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,265
a super aircraft carrier

126
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,868
anchored off the shores
of fortress Europe

127
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:27,936
with hangers and machine shops,

128
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,605
with hundreds of
dispersal points,

129
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:32,172
perimeter tracks and
concrete runways.

130
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:36,148
This is England in
its fifth year of war.

131
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:41,784
(airplane engines roar)

132
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:45,054
And this is the new
battlefront, the air front,

133
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:47,290
from which we seek
out the enemy.

134
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,291
Not his infantry
or his artillery,

135
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,894
not his Panzer divisions,

136
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,628
but the greater menace,

137
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:55,291
the industrial
heart of his nation,

138
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,095
the foundation on which the
Nazi empire and its army stand,

139
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:02,542
the power behind the
German lust for conquest.

140
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,141
The steel mills and refineries,

141
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,476
shipyards and submarine pens,

142
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,779
factories and munitions plants,

143
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:12,648
pinpoints on the map of
Europe which mean rubber,

144
00:13:12,717 --> 00:13:14,150
guns, ball bearings,

145
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:15,485
shells, engines,

146
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:17,890
planes, tanks, targets,

147
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:20,693
targets to be destroyed.

148
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:24,224
And these are the destroyers,

149
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:26,995
each with a belly full of bombs

150
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:30,466
and 10 men like the crew
of the Memphis Belle:

151
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,162
Pilot Captain Robert Morgan,

152
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,171
industrial engineer from
Asheville, North Carolina.

153
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,839
He's flown this ship
across the Atlantic.

154
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,143
The other pilot,
Captain Jim Verinis,

155
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:41,644
business administration student

156
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,679
at the University
of Connecticut.

157
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:46,316
Radio operator and gunner,
Sergeant Bob Hanson,

158
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,152
construction worker from
Spokane, Washington.

159
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,187
Navigator, Captain
Chuck Leighton,

160
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,253
chemistry student
at Ohio Wesleyan.

161
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:56,859
Engineer and top turret
gunner Sergeant Harold Loch

162
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,932
from Green Bay, Wisconsin,
used to be a stevedore.

163
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:02,498
Besides keeping
the bill in order,

164
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,103
he covers the sky above.

165
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:08,364
Tail gunner Sergeant John
Quinlan of Yonkers, New York,

166
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:12,612
clerked for a carpet company
but he quit December 8th, 1941.

167
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,545
Ball turret gunner,
Sergeant Cecil Scott,

168
00:14:16,614 --> 00:14:19,279
pressman for a rubber company
in Rahway, New Jersey.

169
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,592
Pilot to crew,
10,000, put on oxygen.

170
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:29,726
They're climbing higher now,

171
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,394
300 feet a minute.

172
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:34,133
The strain on the planes
and on the men is mounting.

173
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:40,336
The rest of the crew, Bombardier
Captain Vincent Evans,

174
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,572
operated a fleet of trucks
in Fort Worth, Texas.

175
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,069
Waist gunners, on the right,
Sergeant Bill Winchell,

176
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:48,211
chemist for a paint
company in Chicago

177
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,546
and on the left,
Sergeant Tony Nastal,

178
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:52,415
used to repair washing
machines in Detroit

179
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:53,682
when he was a kid.

180
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,956
Now he's 19 and has two
Nazi fighters confirmed.

181
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,727
It takes all of a
pilot's strength

182
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:09,097
to keep a 30-ton Fortress
in tight formation,

183
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,734
but the formation is the
bomber's best defense

184
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:13,172
against enemy fighters.

185
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,239
The planes are deployed
to uncover every gun,

186
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:19,011
stepped up and down,

187
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:22,181
echelon to the right and left,

188
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:25,215
arranged to overcome
the danger of gunners

189
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,949
firing into friendly ships,

190
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:29,785
arranged so concentrated
cones of fire

191
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:33,289
from the caliber 50
machine guns cover the sky

192
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:36,529
for 1,000 yards in
every direction.

193
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,866
(airplane engines hum)

194
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:46,635
The friendly coast of
England slips by below.

195
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,804
It doesn't look like much now,

196
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:51,074
but in a few hours
when you come back,

197
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,641
if you come back,

198
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,348
this will be the most
beautiful view in the world.

199
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:00,311
Higher and higher,

200
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,919
climbing to reach your
best operational altitude,

201
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,255
25,000 feet,

202
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,289
five miles straight up,

203
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,158
so high you can't be
seen from the ground

204
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:10,826
with the naked eye,

205
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,996
so high that after one
minute without oxygen

206
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:14,998
you lose consciousness.

207
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:17,002
After 20 minutes, you're dead.

208
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,402
(airplane engines hum)

209
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:26,109
From now to the target, you
go about your routine duties,

210
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:28,344
plot your course,
check your equipment

211
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,383
and wait and think.

212
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,853
Higher and colder, temperature
40 degrees below zero.

213
00:16:37,922 --> 00:16:40,259
Take off your glove and
you lose some fingers.

214
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:43,692
You look out at the
strange world beyond,

215
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,527
reflections in plexiglass

216
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:48,701
like nothing you ever saw
before outside of a dream.

217
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:55,074
(airplane engines
continue to hum)

218
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:01,877
Higher and higher into
the lightless stratosphere

219
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,379
until the exhaust of the engines

220
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:06,182
mixing with the cold,
thin air condenses

221
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,621
and streams the heavens
with paper trails.

222
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,027
To the men in the ships,

223
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,827
they're far from beautiful,

224
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:21,830
for they point like beckoning
fingers to the formation,

225
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:25,638
signposts in the sky for
the enemy to spot us.

226
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:35,745
For these bombers to
accomplish their mission,

227
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,082
a plan is needed,

228
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,653
carefully worked out,
timed to the minute.

229
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:43,352
The job is to bomb Wilhelmshaven

230
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,588
effectively and economically.

231
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:47,758
The enemy is strong, skillful,

232
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,261
determined to stop us.

233
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,894
Here are his defenses:

234
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:54,763
airdromes, well dispersed.

235
00:17:54,832 --> 00:17:58,270
Each plane indicates a Staffel
or squadron of fighters.

236
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,903
Heavy anti-aircraft,

237
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,407
highly trained and accurate
all along the coast

238
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:06,679
and defending his
vital installations,

239
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:09,510
radar to warn him of our coming.

240
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,449
Here is our plan to
divide his defenses

241
00:18:13,518 --> 00:18:14,854
and weaken his opposition.

242
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:18,954
At 13:30 hours,
shortly after takeoff,

243
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:21,457
six groups of planes will be
heading toward the enemy coast

244
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:23,725
from six directions.

245
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:27,867
The Blue Force, 100 B-24
Liberator four-engine bombers,

246
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:33,736
the White Force, 300
B-17 Flying Fortresses,

247
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:38,641
the Green Force, 300 B-17s
with an escort of six squadrons

248
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,513
of P-47 Thunderbolts,

249
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,645
a force of B-26 Marauders,

250
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,409
twin engine medium bombers

251
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,418
with six squadrons of
RAF Spitfires escorting,

252
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:53,089
almost 1,000 planes and
over 8,000 men in the air.

253
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,658
The enemy alerts
all his airdromes,

254
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,660
but which is our main force?

255
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,461
What are our targets?

256
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,832
Where should the Nazi
controllers send their fighters?

257
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:06,071
It's our job to make them
guess and guess wrong.

258
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:09,672
A half hour later
at 14:00 hours,

259
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:12,775
the Blue Force will be heading
east across the North Sea

260
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:14,414
with the White Force following.

261
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,480
These enemy fighters
are tied down,

262
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:18,681
waiting to meet them,

263
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,116
and will not be able to
attack the Green Force.

264
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:24,019
These fighters must come up
to attack the Green Force

265
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,926
and thus will be no threat
to the Blue and White Forces.

266
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:31,360
The B-26s and Spitfires
will bomb and strafe

267
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,029
a key rail junction,

268
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:35,164
diverting these six Staffel

269
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,466
and preventing the
enemy from concentrating

270
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,696
too many fighters
on the Green Force,

271
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:43,443
which is scheduled to bomb an
aircraft factory at Hanover.

272
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,213
At 14:30 hours the Blue
Force will threaten

273
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:53,786
this entire coastal area
of Northwestern Germany.

274
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:57,390
Which target will it be?

275
00:19:58,457 --> 00:19:59,258
Flensburg?

276
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,394
The Kiel Canal?

277
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:05,161
Or will it turn suddenly
and bomb Hamburg,

278
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,396
Vegesack or Emden?

279
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,166
Actually, it carries
no bombs at all.

280
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:11,567
It's a decoy

281
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:14,036
and keeps the fighters
from the northern area busy

282
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:16,372
while the White Force,
the main effort,

283
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,639
heads for the submarine
pens of Wilhelmshaven.

284
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,245
At 15:00 hours,

285
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,914
while the White Force
is over its target,

286
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,582
only a fraction of the available

287
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:29,322
German fighter strength of
the area can intercept it

288
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,492
because of the Blue
Force diversion

289
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:36,829
and the simultaneous bombing
of Hanover by the Green Force.

290
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,000
This is the plan of
battle for today,

291
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,637
drawn up by the Combined
Operations Planning Committee

292
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,440
and approved by the
commanding general.

293
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:53,012
The White Force, lead
group, low squadron.

294
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:57,413
We've crossed the invisible
line of enemy radar.

295
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:59,184
The Hun is expecting us.

296
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,523
(airplane engines roar)

297
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:09,725
Steel helmets go on.

298
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:12,794
Watchful eyes strain.

299
00:21:12,863 --> 00:21:15,034
Tight formations are
held tighter still.

300
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:19,839
Tense gunners more alert
because here it comes,

301
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:23,643
the enemy coast.

302
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,812
From up here it looks
the same as any other,

303
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:30,980
houses, roads,

304
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:33,353
green fields,
factories, waterways,

305
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,784
but they are the
houses and fields

306
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,254
of those who invade and oppress.

307
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:40,656
They are the factories
and roads of the people

308
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:42,992
who twice in one generation have

309
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:45,161
flooded the world
with suffering,

310
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,495
suffering in such quantity

311
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:49,068
as the history of the
human race has never known,

312
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:53,669
brought torment and anguish
into countless American homes,

313
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:57,577
gold stars and telegrams
from the War Department.

314
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:03,279
(exploding shells bang)

315
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:05,816
The first flak, just
harmless-looking

316
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:07,850
silent puffs of smoke,

317
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,852
only each puff is
a shell exploding,

318
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,752
throwing shrapnel
around the sky,

319
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,623
exactly the range,

320
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:17,192
accurate flak by
radio prediction.

321
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,495
Five miles down, Nazi
anti-aircraft batteries have

322
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:22,198
calculated the altitude
speed and course.

323
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:23,867
Where will the next one hit?

324
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,270
You try not to be there.

325
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,944
(exploding shells bang)

326
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:35,979
The docks and submarine
pens of Wilhelmshaven.

327
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:38,147
Approach to the target starts.

328
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,119
No smokescreen can protect it.

329
00:22:42,254 --> 00:22:45,625
(exploding shells bang)

330
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,557
Now the enemy knows the
path of your approach

331
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:51,194
and walls that path
with a flak barrage,

332
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:53,061
but you fly right through it,

333
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,435
flak so thick you can
get out and walk on it.

334
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:03,242
(exploding shells bang)

335
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:07,909
Morgan changes course
every 15 seconds,

336
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:10,315
evasive action to confuse
the flak batteries.

337
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:15,551
Bomb site set for correct
altitude and speed.

338
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,248
Bomb bay doors open.

339
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:18,819
The bombing run begins.

340
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:23,824
Pilot to Bombardier,
okay, Vin, you've got it.

341
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:27,763
Now Evans flies
the Memphis Belle,

342
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:30,266
controlling it
through the bomb site.

343
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,137
And now we are most vulnerable.

344
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:34,270
Committed to our bombing run,

345
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:36,940
we can't dodge flak or fighters.

346
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,407
Here's the first.

347
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:41,347
(gunfire rattles)

348
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:46,319
(airplane engines whine)

349
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:49,188
Top turret fires at it.

350
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:52,621
Evans must ignore the battle,

351
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,623
crosshairs lined up on target,

352
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:56,362
adjustments for wind drift made.

353
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:59,963
Two more fighters diving
from nine o'clock.

354
00:24:00,032 --> 00:24:03,466
(gunfire rattles)

355
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,170
Flak now has the range too.

356
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,939
(explosion bangs)

357
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,106
They've hit this Fort,

358
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:11,844
but he keeps on his bombing run.

359
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,650
As lead Bombardier,
Evans' aim must be good.

360
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,651
Every other ship in the
group will drop its bombs

361
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,989
when he drops his.

362
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,158
Now one pointer on the
bomb site moves toward

363
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:30,160
another stationary pointer.

364
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:33,065
The instant they touch,
bombs will release.

365
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,571
(airplane engine roars)

366
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:48,514
They touch,

367
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:51,417
bombs away.

368
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:56,589
(exploding bombs bang)

369
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:10,403
(airplane engine hums)

370
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,078
(exploding bombs bang)

371
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:26,786
(airplane engine
continues to hum)

372
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:56,512
(exploding bombs bang)

373
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:59,916
The first half of the mission
is over, the easy half.

374
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:02,322
Now to get home.

375
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:09,758
The flak stops.

376
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:12,332
That means fighters
out there somewhere.

377
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:15,431
Are Staffel lurking
behind that cloud,

378
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,600
or hiding up in the sun
where the glare blinds you

379
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,104
and you can't see them
waiting to dive down on you?

380
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:22,772
Fighters at six o'clock.

381
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,608
This is what a gunner
sees, a speck in the sky.

382
00:26:25,677 --> 00:26:27,410
That's a fighter,
and then a blink.

383
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,779
That means he's firing at you,

384
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,546
2,300 rounds a minute.

385
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,519
(gunfire rattles)

386
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:36,119
(airplane engine roars)

387
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,586
(gunfire rattles)

388
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,082
In a running battle,

389
00:26:39,151 --> 00:26:41,090
one of the most important
instruments is the interphone.

390
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,428
(gunfire continues to rattle)

391
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:47,563
- [Crew] There's four of
'em, one o'clock high,

392
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:48,631
they're coming around.

393
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,637
(gunfire rattles)

394
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,973
Two fighters, six o'clock
up coming in, firing at you.

395
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,143
- [Crew] B-17 in trouble
our two o'clock,

396
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:01,577
watch it.

397
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,312
- [Crew] Got an engine on fire.

398
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:06,218
(gunfire rattles)

399
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,486
- [Crew] There's two more,
diving through the 94th.

400
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:13,089
- [Crew] Three planes, nine
o'clock, coming around.

401
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:14,290
Keep your eye on 'em, boys.

402
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:17,593
(gunfire rattles)

403
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:18,927
- [Crew] Firing at 10.

404
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:20,296
- [Crew] Watch 'em, Chuck,
keep your eyes open.

405
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,664
- [Crew] They're breaking
at 11, breaking at 11.

406
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,126
(gunfire rattles)

407
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:25,668
- [Crew] There we go at two
o'clock, watch 'em, Scottie.

408
00:27:25,737 --> 00:27:27,836
- [Scottie] I got
my sights on 'em.

409
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:30,272
- [Crew 3] Check that B-17,
Chuck, at three o'clock.

410
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,174
The motor's smoking.

411
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:32,674
Fighter at 10:30, coming around.

412
00:27:32,743 --> 00:27:34,643
- [Crew] Are those
10:30 upper or lower?

413
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:37,583
(gunfire rattles)

414
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:43,756
- [Crew] B-17 out of
control at three o'clock.

415
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,991
- [Crew] Come on you guys, get
out of that plane, bail out.

416
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,194
There's one, he come
out of the bomb bay.

417
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:53,463
- [Crew] Yeah, I see 'em.

418
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:55,067
- [Crew] There's the
tail gunner coming out.

419
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:02,204
- [Crew] Watch out for fighters.

420
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:03,539
- [Crew] See any
parachutes, Quinlan?

421
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:05,244
- [Crew] Flak at nine o'clock.

422
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:07,810
- [Crew] Eight men
still in that B-17.

423
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,845
Come on, get out of there.
- [Crew] Come on, bail out.

424
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:11,882
- [Crew] There's
three more 'chutes.

425
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,184
- [Crew] Flak at 11 o'clock.

426
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:16,185
(airplane engines roar)

427
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:21,260
- [Crew] 109 at three o'clock.

428
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:23,359
- [Crew] Come on,
you son of a bitch.

429
00:28:23,428 --> 00:28:26,298
(gunfire rattles)

430
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:32,869
- [Crew] He got him, chief.

431
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,069
Look, he's bailing out.

432
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:36,405
- [Crew] Damn it, don't
yell on that intercom.

433
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:37,907
- [Crew] Fighters, 10 o'clock.

434
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,375
- [Crew] Watch those
two, they're coming in.

435
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:40,910
- [Crew] They're coming in.

436
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:43,079
- [Crew] Let's get that
ball turret on them.

437
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:46,549
(gunfire rattles)

438
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:49,585
- [Crew] Save the ammunition
as much as possible.

439
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:52,592
(gunfire rattles)

440
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:56,760
- [Crew] Watch that fighter
coming in at three o'clock.

441
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:00,396
(airplane engine roars)

442
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:02,365
(gunfire rattles)

443
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:03,766
- [Crew] He's coming
in on a half roll.

444
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:04,600
Pull her up, chief.

445
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:05,769
Pull her up, hurry.

446
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:08,674
(gunfire rattles)

447
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:11,740
- [Narrator] This
Fortress is hurt,

448
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,710
engine on fire, losing
airspeed and altitude,

449
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:19,115
drifting into the flak alone
and helpless, a straggler.

450
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:20,783
In a minute, Nazi
fighters will swarm in

451
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:22,355
like buzzards for the kill.

452
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:26,556
You can watch, but you
can't go down to help.

453
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,860
You keep your formation.

454
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:34,130
(pensive music plays)

455
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:36,727
Here too, the mission
is being flown,

456
00:29:36,796 --> 00:29:38,100
none the less real for being

457
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:40,540
in the minds and hearts
of these men behind.

458
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:43,806
Ask anybody who's been
to a field in England

459
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,141
or anywhere else our
bombers are based,

460
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,648
and he'll tell you that
there's drama here too,

461
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:52,212
waiting to see
who's coming back.

462
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:55,484
To watch them, you
might not realize

463
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:58,154
how tense these
ground crews are,

464
00:29:58,223 --> 00:29:59,616
but they are tense

465
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:00,660
and plenty worried.

466
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,755
In Air Force talk,
this waiting is known

467
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:06,699
as sweating out the mission.

468
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:09,832
These men know the flight plan.

469
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:11,662
Their watches told them
when the bombers were

470
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:13,602
running into enemy flak,

471
00:30:13,671 --> 00:30:15,504
when they were over the target,

472
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:17,801
when they left the enemy coast

473
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,608
and now their watches tell them

474
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:21,581
the bombers should
be nearing the field.

475
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:25,184
Every ear strains for the
first sound of the engines

476
00:30:26,418 --> 00:30:27,887
and then somebody hears them

477
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,686
and somebody sees the
first faint specks

478
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:32,621
in the distance sky.

479
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,256
(pensive music continues)

480
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,898
Every face turns to see

481
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:40,933
and count.

482
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:45,938
The watchers try to read
the numbers on the ships.

483
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:51,034
These planes have
priority to land first.

484
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:53,446
The colored flares
mean wounded aboard.

485
00:30:54,613 --> 00:30:56,212
In the hospital window,

486
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:58,384
these watching men
know what that means.

487
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:00,716
They know what it
feels like to lie

488
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:04,487
on a bouncing Fortress
floor for hundreds of miles

489
00:31:04,556 --> 00:31:06,823
through the frozen stratosphere,

490
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:08,524
in great pain,

491
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:10,827
with the other men in your
crew fighting to keep you alive

492
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,131
until they hit the field.

493
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:14,600
The field,

494
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:16,636
home.

495
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:18,638
It'll be okay then

496
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:22,538
because there'll be
medical care, the best,

497
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:25,110
as soon as the wheels of
your plane stop rolling.

498
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:31,150
(engines hum)

499
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,655
(pensive music continues)

500
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:39,825
Head wound, concussion.

501
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:45,261
20 millimeter cannon
shell exploded

502
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,666
in his radio compartment.

503
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:50,503
Shock, internal injuries.

504
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:53,334
He'll be all right, though.

505
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:57,706
Flak bursts scattered
flying shrapnel.

506
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,479
He's full of steel splinters.

507
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:04,446
This pilot's leg is
not a pretty sight.

508
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:06,852
Neither are the docks
at Wilhelmshaven.

509
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:11,156
These men will all
get the Purple Heart

510
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:16,161
and this man too, posthumously.

511
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,037
A transfusion
right in the plane.

512
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:29,472
This gunner's too
weak to be moved.

513
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:33,142
The new, life-giving blood
flowing into his veins

514
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:36,312
might be the blood of a high
school girl in Des Moines,

515
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:40,082
a miner in Alabama, a
movie star in Hollywood,

516
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,554
or it might be your blood.

517
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:44,724
Whosever it is, thanks.

518
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:49,325
(airplane engines hum)

519
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:52,294
36 planes left this
field this morning.

520
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:53,629
Now six more arrive.

521
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:55,298
That makes 20 home

522
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:56,569
and this one's 21,

523
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:58,704
more wounded aboard.

524
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,242
(airplane engine hums)

525
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:11,584
22, coming in with his
left inboard engine dead.

526
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:16,188
(airplane engine hums)

527
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:21,260
23, with a feathered prop
on his left outboard engine.

528
00:33:23,528 --> 00:33:27,428
24, Southern Comfort,
with a chunk of tail gone.

529
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:31,871
25, they flew home
on their luck.

530
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:34,607
26,

531
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:37,276
not a scratch.

532
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:42,678
The control tower learns
that two more landed

533
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:45,009
at a British field to the south,

534
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:47,850
one a crash landing, crew safe.

535
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:48,788
That makes 28.

536
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:55,225
29, a rough landing but
her pilot's badly hurt.

537
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,397
It's a wonder he
brought her back at all.

538
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,302
29 planes back so far,

539
00:34:04,602 --> 00:34:06,406
29 out of 36.

540
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:09,274
Our losses were heavy,

541
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,244
but the enemy's
were far heavier.

542
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:15,378
We destroyed a German
aircraft factory,

543
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:17,746
a rail junction, submarine pens,

544
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:19,748
docks and harbor installations.

545
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:22,218
That's specific, known damage,

546
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:24,587
but who can tell the
number of German torpedoes

547
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:26,388
that will not be fired,

548
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:28,891
the number of our convoys
that will get through now,

549
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,860
the soldiers' and seamens'
lives that will be saved

550
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,430
or the battles that will
be won instead of lost

551
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:37,867
because of what these
bombers and airmen did today?

552
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:41,106
(heroic music plays)

553
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,315
Pilot and tail gunner,

554
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:52,352
they can laugh now.

555
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:56,285
Fire on the inboard
engine did this.

556
00:34:56,354 --> 00:34:59,024
Flames streaked back and
burned the stabilizer tool.

557
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:03,459
Another crew luck brought back.

558
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:07,032
(heroic music continues)

559
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:19,144
Here's Old Bill,

560
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:22,979
a pretty good airplane
when it took off,

561
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:24,914
lost its nose,

562
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,783
lost its navigator,

563
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,053
bombardier wounded,

564
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,056
top turret gunner and pilot hit,

565
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:35,861
hydraulic system shot
out, no brakes, no flaps,

566
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:38,364
but Old Bill came back.

567
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:49,172
Now among the
returned crew members

568
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:51,607
talk flows like a river,

569
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:53,746
talking out every
detail of the mission.

570
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,749
These are the faces of combat,

571
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:00,753
faces of Americans who have
watched their comrades die,

572
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,756
faces that can never
forget the enemy,

573
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:07,259
and they are in no mood to
have their picture taken.

574
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:15,067
In the control tower,
Colonel Ray, Group CO,

575
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:17,466
is still watching and waiting.

576
00:36:17,535 --> 00:36:18,834
(heroic music plays)

577
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:21,774
And he spots the last
flight, three more planes

578
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,411
and one of them is the ship
everyone has been pulling for,

579
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,082
the Memphis Belle.

580
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,517
The last few miles of this
trip have been a joy ride.

581
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:37,053
The strain is over.

582
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:39,020
They can leave their guns now.

583
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:41,157
Now they know they're
going to go home,

584
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:43,526
to Spokane, Green
Bay, Asheville,

585
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:45,056
Detroit, Chicago,

586
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,766
Fort Worth and Yonkers.

587
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:53,736
(airplane engine hums)

588
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:56,239
The Belle comes
in for her landing

589
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:58,841
but first Morgan
buzzes the field,

590
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,113
cuts the grass with
a giant Fortress.

591
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:05,882
It's against the rules, but
this is a special occasion.

592
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:09,322
(airplane engine roars)

593
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,658
(suspenseful music plays)

594
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:39,076
(braking wheels squeak)

595
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:40,244
(joyous music plays)

596
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,751
The wheels of the Memphis Belle

597
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,790
come back to the soil of
England for the 25th time.

598
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:49,690
(joyous music continues)

599
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:23,062
(joyous music continues)

600
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:45,418
This is a day they
will never forget.

601
00:38:51,256 --> 00:38:53,155
Another great day soon after,

602
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:55,595
Brigadier General
Hansell visited the field

603
00:38:56,928 --> 00:38:58,862
and presented the
Distinguished Flying Cross

604
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:00,433
to every member of the crew.

605
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:07,768
(car engine hums)

606
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:12,277
And then there was another day.

607
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:16,281
(military drum rolls)

608
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:25,786
(majestic music plays)

609
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:37,437
Their Majesties, the King
and Queen of England.

610
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,142
(majestic music continues)

611
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,929
Johnny Quinlan never
thought anything like this

612
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:09,001
would happen to him
when he left Yonkers.

613
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:18,607
The ground crew were a
little self-conscious

614
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:20,743
about being dressed in fatigues,

615
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:22,982
but the Queen thought
they were very nice.

616
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:31,554
(military drum roll plays)

617
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:33,956
Finally, two more visitors came.

618
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:36,792
General Eaker, commanding
the 8th Air Force,

619
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:40,563
and General Devers, US Commander
of the European Theatre.

620
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:43,799
The Belle crew received
them in flying clothes

621
00:40:43,868 --> 00:40:45,300
as General Eaker read the order

622
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,474
for what he called their 26th
and most important mission,

623
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,574
return to America
to train new crews

624
00:40:51,643 --> 00:40:54,109
and to tell the people
what we're doing here,

625
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:56,312
to thank them for
their help and support

626
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:57,647
and tell them to keep it up

627
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,482
so we can keep it up,

628
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:03,486
so we can bomb the enemy
again and again and again

629
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:04,724
until he has had enough.

630
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:07,827
And then we can all come home.

631
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:12,164
(triumphant music plays)

632
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:23,904
(airplane engine roars)

633
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:33,753
(triumphant music continues)

634
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:39,692
(airplane engines roar)

635
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:48,364
To the men of the 8th Air Force

636
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:51,167
who are now flying
deep into Germany,

637
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:53,002
bringing destruction to targets

638
00:41:53,071 --> 00:41:56,039
almost 1,000 miles
from their bases,

639
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:57,777
destruction like this,

640
00:41:59,944 --> 00:42:02,782
and who have never once been
turned back by the enemy,

641
00:42:03,915 --> 00:42:07,252
to those men, this film
is gratefully dedicated.

642
00:42:15,143 --> 00:42:18,146
(serene music plays)

643
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:50,913
(serene music continues)

644
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:24,913
(serene music continues)

645
00:43:55,977 --> 00:43:59,481
(serene music continues)

646
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:34,649
(serene music continues)

647
00:45:05,347 --> 00:45:08,316
(no audio present)
