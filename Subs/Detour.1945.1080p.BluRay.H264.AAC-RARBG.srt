1
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:44,165
Well, here we are.
I turn down here at the next block.

2
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,876
Thanks, mister. I'll get off there.

3
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:56,386
- Want anything else?
- No.

4
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:57,554
Hey, you.

5
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,268
- Me?
- Yeah, you. Where ya heading?

6
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,688
- East.
- Too bad.

7
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,441
I thought if you was headin' north,
I might be able to help you out.

8
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,278
Pushing to Salt Lake,
and I don't like to ride alone at night.

9
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,030
I'm one of those guys that gotta talk
or I fall asleep.

10
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,740
So I gotta get my--

11
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,159
My partner,
he's got Lou to keep him company.

12
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,911
But I ain't got nobody at all.

13
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,622
- Where ya comin' from?
- West.

14
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,333
Yeah, sure, I know,
but where? LA?

15
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,794
- Maybe.
- Got a cousin out in LA.

16
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,588
- You don't say?
- Yeah, he's been out —

17
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,507
You're not much of a talker, are ya?

18
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:36,509
My mother taught me
never to speak to strangers.

19
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,428
- A wise guy?
- So what?

20
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:42,432
Okay, okay. Don't get sore.
Just trying to be sociable, that's all.

21
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,310
Hey, Glamorous.

22
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,020
Give me change for a dime, will ya?

23
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,823
Let's have something quieter this time, Joe.

24
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:00,909
- My head's splitting.
- Is that what's wrong with it?

25
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,749
- Done with your coffee?
- No. And don't rush me, will ya?

26
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,175
Hey, turn that off.
Will ya turn that thing off?

27
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,052
- What's eating you now?
- Yeah, what's eating you?

28
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:21,054
- That music. It stinks!
- You don't like it?

29
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,222
- No, turn it off!
- Now wait a minute, pal.

30
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:24,974
That was my nickel, see?

31
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:28,061
This is a free country,
and I play whatever I want to.

32
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,647
Okay.

33
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,024
Sure. And if you don't like,
you don't have to listen to it.

34
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,068
And you can leave here anytime you wanna.

35
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,694
Okay, okay. I'm sorry I asked.

36
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,988
First good piece played tonight,
and you don't like it.

37
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:41,491
Some people just ain't got any good taste.

38
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:55,964
<i>That tune. That tune!</i>

39
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,299
<i>Why was there always that rotten tune?</i>

40
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,177
<i>Following me around, beating in my head,</i>
<i>never letting up.</i>

41
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,183
<i>Did you ever wanna forget anything?</i>

42
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,520
<i>Did you ever wanna cut away</i>
<i>a piece of your memory or blot it out?</i>

43
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,399
<i>You can't, you know?</i>
<i>No matter how hard you try.</i>

44
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,442
<i>You can change the scenery,</i>

45
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,611
<i>but sooner or later</i>
<i>you’ll get a whiff of perfume,</i>

46
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,197
<i>or somebody will say a certain phrase</i>
<i>or maybe hum something.</i>

47
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,533
<i>Then you're licked again.</i>

48
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,996
<i>"I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me."</i>

49
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,956
<i>I used to love that song once.</i>

50
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,126
<i>So did the customers back in the old</i>
<i>Break O' Dawn Club in New York.</i>

51
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,713
<i>I can't remember a night when I didn’t get</i>
<i>at least three requests for it.</i>

52
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:40,758
<i>Sue, she was always selling it too.</i>

53
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,552
<i>Those were the days.</i>

54
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:11,247
<i>♪ Your eyes of blue</i>
<i>Your kisses too ♪</i>

55
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>♪ I never knew what they could do ♪</i>

56
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:19,422
<i>♪ I can't believe that you're in love with me ♪</i>

57
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:23,134
<i>♪ You're telling everyone you know ♪</i>

58
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,345
<i>♪ That I'm on your mind each place you go ♪</i>

59
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:31,225
<i>♪ They can't believe</i>
<i>That you're in love with me ♪</i>

60
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:38,191
<i>♪ I have always placed you far above me ♪</i>

61
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:43,780
<i>♪ I just can't imagine that you love me ♪</i>

62
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,075
<i>♪ And after all is said and done ♪</i>

63
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:50,286
<i>♪ To think that I'm the lucky one ♪</i>

64
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:55,750
<i>♪ I can't believe that you're in love with me ♪</i>

65
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,717
<i>It wasn't much of a club, really.</i>

66
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:06,302
<i>You know the kind.</i>

67
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,387
<i>A joint where you could have a sandwich</i>
<i>and a few drinks,</i>

68
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,057
<i>and run interference for your girl</i>
<i>on the dance floor.</i>

69
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,103
<i>I fronted the piano in there every night</i>

70
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,313
<i>from 8:00 until the place closed up,</i>

71
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,565
<i>which usually meant 4:00 in the morning.</i>

72
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:22,068
<i>A good job as jobs went in those days.</i>

73
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,741
<i>Then, too, there was Sue,</i>

74
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:31,786
<i>who made working there</i>
<i>a little like working in heaven.</i>

75
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:36,374
<i>But how we felt about each other, well,</i>
<i>there was nothing very unusual in that.</i>

76
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,836
<i>I was an ordinary healthy guy,</i>
<i>and she was an ordinary healthy girl,</i>

77
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,172
<i>and when you add those two together,</i>
<i>you get an ordinary healthy romance,</i>

78
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:44,674
<i>which is the old story.</i>

79
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:49,428
<i>Sure. But somehow</i>
<i>the most wonderful thing in the world.</i>

80
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,438
<i>All in all, I was a pretty lucky guy.</i>

81
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,496
Mr. Patterewsky, I presume?
It's beautiful.

82
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,665
You're going to make Carnegie Hall yet, Al.

83
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,334
Yeah. As a janitor.

84
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,253
I'll make my debut in the basement.

85
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:26,007
I don't blame you for being bitter,
darling, but you mustn't give up hope.

86
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,800
- Why, some day—
- Yeah, some day,

87
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,635
if I don't get arthritis first.

88
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,387
In the meantime, let's blow this trap.

89
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,784
- Like to get something to eat, hon?
- I don't think so, Al.

90
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,913
I lose my appetite working in this fleabag.

91
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,956
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

92
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,418
I can't stand much more of that dump.

93
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,213
Did you see that drunk tonight
trying to paw me?

94
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:08,549
- No, what drunk?
- Does it matter what drunk?

95
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,802
Say, what's the matter with you tonight, darling?

96
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,513
That's the third time you started
to tell me something and then stopped.

97
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,808
We shouldn't have any secrets
from each other, Sue.

98
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,269
Next week, we're gonna make with a ring
and a license. We'll be a team.

99
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,397
Yes, that's right. In the bush league.

100
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,192
- I don't get ya.
- We've been struck out.

101
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:29,278
That's a funny way to talk, darling.

102
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:31,739
- Don't you wanna marry me?
- Al, look, I love you.

103
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,200
You know I do.
And I want to marry you.

104
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,744
- But...?
- But not now.

105
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,288
Only after we've made good.

106
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:40,998
Sunday I'm going away.

107
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,668
I know you'll think it's silly.

108
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,003
That's why I hesitated to tell you.

109
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,797
But I'm going to California.

110
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,299
I wanna try my luck in Hollywood.

111
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,760
That's the most
stupid thing I ever heard of.

112
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,389
Don't you know millions of people go out there
every year and wind up polishing cuspidors?

113
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:57,640
I thought you had better sense.

114
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,600
You sound as if you think
I don't have any talent.

115
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,103
- That has nothing to do with it.
- I'll make out all right.

116
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,938
Maybe. But what about me?

117
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,565
Doesn't it mean anything to you
that you're busting up all our plans?

118
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,819
- We may not see each other for years?
- It won't be that long.

119
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,113
- I thought you loved me.
- I do.

120
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,739
You know I do.

121
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:18,327
Well, here we are.

122
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:21,789
Al...

123
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,543
Al, why can't you see my side of it?

124
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,296
I'm young. We both are. And...

125
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,007
And we've got all the time in the world
to settle down.

126
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,968
Really, darling.

127
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,305
What I'm doing is the only sane thing to do.

128
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:40,891
I... I hate the thought
of being so far away from you.

129
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:44,228
But... But we'll be together again some day.

130
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,565
Maybe you'll decide
to come out too, later on.

131
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,900
- So long.
- Al.

132
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:53,070
Aren't you gonna kiss me good night?

133
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,239
Sure, why not?

134
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,993
Good night.

135
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,471
Say, Roberts.

136
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:45,850
You hit the jackpot this time. Ten bucks.

137
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,393
Thanks.

138
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,026
<i>So when this drunk handed me</i>
<i>a ten-spot after a request,</i>

139
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,528
<i>I couldn’t get very excited.</i>

140
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,365
<i>What was it, I asked myself?</i>
<i>A piece of paper crawling with germs.</i>

141
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:03,868
<i>Couldn't buy anything I wanted.</i>

142
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,244
<i>It couldn't...</i>

143
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,707
<i>Then I thought of something.</i>

144
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,315
Long distance.

145
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,859
I'd like to put a call through to Los Angeles.

146
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,195
Miss Harvey. Sue Harvey.

147
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,071
H-A-R-V-E-Y.

148
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:44,617
The number is CRestview 65723.

149
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,388
4.50.

150
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,349
4.75.

151
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,433
5.00.

152
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,022
Hello, Sue? This is Al.

153
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,358
Baby, it's great to hear from you too.

154
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,653
What's that? You do?
Me too, darling.

155
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,364
I thought I'd go batty without you.
I just had to —

156
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,451
You're workin' as a hash slinger?

157
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,869
Gee, honey, that's tough.

158
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,373
Those guys out in Hollywood don't know
the real thing when it's right in front of them.

159
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,166
You just stick it out, Sue, baby.

160
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,419
Keep goin' around to those casting offices.
I'm sure you'll click.

161
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,631
Look, I'll tell you what.
You stay put out there. I'll come to you.

162
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,634
No, don't try to stop me. Just expect me.

163
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,762
Train? Who knows?
Train, plane, bus, magic carpet.

164
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,432
I'll be there if I have to crawl.
If I have to travel by pogo stick.

165
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,811
And then... let's get married right away.

166
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,441
That's the stuff. That's what
I've been wanting to hear you say.

167
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:03,112
Well, good-bye for now.

168
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,907
I'll be seeing you soon.

169
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:10,494
Yeah. Bye.

170
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,502
<i>The only way I could</i>
<i>cross country was to thumb rides,</i>

171
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:21,589
<i>for even after hocking everything,</i>
<i>I only had enough money to eat.</i>

172
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,925
<i>Money. You know what that is.</i>

173
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:27,553
<i>It's the stuff you never have enough of.</i>

174
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,722
<i>Little green things</i>
<i>with George Washington's picture</i>

175
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:33,434
<i>that men slave for,</i>
<i>commit crimes for, die for.</i>

176
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,228
<i>It's the stuff that has caused</i>
<i>more trouble in the world</i>

177
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,188
<i>than anything else we ever invented,</i>

178
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,275
<i>simply because there's too little of it.</i>

179
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,444
<i>At least I had too little of it.</i>

180
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,321
<i>So it was me for the thumb.</i>

181
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,172
<i>Ever done any hitchhiking?</i>

182
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,883
<i>It's not much fun, believe me.</i>

183
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,844
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I know all about how it's an education,</i>

184
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,597
<i>and how you get to meet a lot of people,</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

185
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,851
<i>But me, from now on</i>
<i>I'll take my education in college,</i>

186
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:20,189
<i>or in P. S. 62, or I'll send $1. 98</i>
<i>in stamps for ten easy lessons.</i>

187
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:33,369
<i>Thumbing rides may save you bus fare,</i>
<i>but it's dangerous.</i>

188
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,956
<i>You never know what's in store for you</i>
<i>when you hear the squeal of brakes.</i>

189
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:43,003
<i>If only I had known what I was getting into</i>
<i>that day in Arizona.</i>

190
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,548
Here, throw that in the back seat.

191
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,303
Okay, let's go.
Make sure that door's closed.

192
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:09,321
<i>You know, Emily Post ought to write</i>
<i>a book of rules for guys thumbing rides.</i>

193
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,033
<i>Because as it is now you never know</i>
<i>what's right and what's wrong.</i>

194
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,287
<i>We rode along for a little while,</i>
<i>neither one of us saying anything.</i>

195
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,540
<i>I was glad of that.</i>

196
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,459
<i>I never know what to say</i>
<i>to strange people driving cars.</i>

197
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,547
<i>And too, you can never tell</i>
<i>if a guy wants to talk.</i>

198
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,633
<i>A lot of rides have been cut short</i>
<i>because of a big mouth.</i>

199
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,847
<i>So I kept my mouth shut</i>
<i>until he started opening up.</i>

200
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,475
Hand me that little box
in the compartment, will ya, pal?

201
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,938
Hold the wheel, will ya?

202
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,452
- How far are ya going?
- LA.

203
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,579
Well, you're really traveling aren't ya?

204
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,706
Yeah, but I don't expect to make it
for a couple years

205
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,374
at the rate I've been promoting rides.

206
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,584
Not much luck?

207
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,461
Sure. All bad.

208
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,755
Not many people stop for a guy these days.

209
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,298
Afraid of a stickup maybe.

210
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,507
You can't blame 'em.

211
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,677
- Where ya comin' from?
- New York.

212
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:17,139
Well, New York. You're in luck this time.

213
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,141
I'm goin' all the way.

214
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,809
Right through to Los Angeles.

215
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,104
- You drive a car?
- Sure.

216
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,899
- Whenever you're tired, let me know.
- I'll holler.

217
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,778
I guess at least an hour passed
before I noticed

218
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,780
those deep scratches in his right hand.

219
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,698
They were wicked.

220
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:37,534
Three puffy red lines
about a quarter of an inch apart.

221
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,871
He must have seen me looking at them
because he said...

222
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,290
Beauties, aren't they?

223
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,959
They're gonna be scars someday.

224
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,004
What an animal.

225
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,882
Whatever it was, it must have been
pretty big and vicious to have done that.

226
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,426
Right on both counts, New York.

227
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,638
I was tussling with the most
dangerous animal in the world —

228
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,806
a woman.

229
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,016
She must have been Tarzan's mate.

230
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,768
Looks like you lost the bout.

231
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,561
Certainly wasn't a draw.

232
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,315
You know, there ought to be a law
against dames with claws.

233
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,316
Yeah.

234
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,485
I tossed her out of the car on her ear.

235
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,657
Was I wrong? Give a lift to a tomato,
you expect her to be nice, don't ya?

236
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,658
Yeah.

237
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:20,244
After all, what kind of dames thumb rides?

238
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,579
- Sunday school teachers?
- Yeah.

239
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,749
The little witch.

240
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,460
She must've thought she was riding
with some fall guy.

241
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,339
And me who's been booking horses
around racetracks since I was 20.

242
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:34,925
I've known a million dames like her.

243
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,219
- Two million.
- Yeah.

244
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,140
Stopped the car, opened the door...

245
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,643
"Take it on the Arthur Duffy, sister,"
I told her.

246
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,105
- That's the stuff.
- As I was down on her.

247
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,150
But if you wanna see a real scar, brother,
get a load of this.

248
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,028
Wow.

249
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,906
- I got that one dueling.
- Dueling?

250
00:19:58,407 --> 00:19:59,867
Yeah. We were just kidding, of course.

251
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,452
My dad owned a couple of
Franco-Prussian sabers.

252
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,246
Kept 'em on the wall for decorations.

253
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:09,751
One day, another kid and I took 'em down
when the old man wasn't around. Had a duel.

254
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,589
He hit me in the arm, here.

255
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,340
Pretty mean cut.

256
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,967
Infection set in later.

257
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,844
Yeah, I can see that.

258
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,430
- Gimme that box again, will ya?
- Yeah.

259
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,527
Pain made me lose my head, I guess.

260
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,696
I began slashing.

261
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,490
Before I knew it,
I put the other kid's eye out.

262
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:43,952
- That was tough.
- Well, it was just an accident, of course.

263
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:48,415
But you know how kids are. I got scared —
decided I was gonna run away from home.

264
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,960
Old man almost clocked me
when I was packin' my duds.

265
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,298
If the bloody rag I had wrapped around my wrist
hadn't caught his attention,

266
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,050
he'd have seen the bundle for sure.

267
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,553
But I beat it when he was phoning for a doctor.

268
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:06,600
That was 15, 16 years ago.
I haven't been home since.

269
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,731
Pull in there for a bite of something?

270
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,483
<i>A bite of something.</i>

271
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,068
<i>Brother, was I hungry.</i>

272
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,403
<i>I hadn't had anything in my stomach for hours.</i>

273
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,406
<i>Yet even with that gnawing</i>
<i>in the pit of my belly,</i>

274
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,326
<i>I didn't want to be in too big a rush</i>
<i>to put on the feed bag.</i>

275
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,829
<i>First, I had to make sure</i>
<i>this guy knew the score.</i>

276
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,249
<i>If I got him down on me,</i>
<i>it was good-bye ticket to Hollywood.</i>

277
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,710
I'll wait out here for you, mister.

278
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,755
If it's the money, don't worry about
paying for it. This time it's on me.

279
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,257
- Well, that's white of you, Mr. —
- Haskell. Think nothing of it.

280
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,719
You make your first million, maybe you can
do the same for me. Come on, New York.

281
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,596
I gotta make the West Coast by Wednesday.

282
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,265
There's a horse running at
Santa Anita named Paradisiacal.

283
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,935
- Means dough to me if I'm running.
- We'll make it all right.

284
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,690
<i>He did most of the talking</i>
<i>during the half hour we were in the place.</i>

285
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:55,774
<i>I ate.</i>

286
00:21:56,858 --> 00:22:01,029
<i>He rambled on about his old man, who he hadn't</i>
<i>heard from since he ran away as a kid,</i>

287
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,948
<i>and how he happened to become a bookie,</i>

288
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,742
<i>and then all about how he got rooked in Miami.</i>

289
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,662
One race, 38 grand.
They cleaned out my book.

290
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:11,081
- How do you like that?
- That was tough luck.

291
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,166
Yeah, and I'm supposed to be the smart guy.

292
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,545
You just wait. I'm going back to Florida
next season with all kinds of jack.

293
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:18,588
And you watch those stinkers run for cover.

294
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,967
- Want anything else?
- No, thanks, I've had plenty.

295
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,558
The check there, sister?

296
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,521
Just a minute. Your change, sir.

297
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,274
- Keep it, sister.
- Thank you, sir. Call again.

298
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,192
I'll be waitin' outside for you
when you finish work.

299
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,778
Sharp chick?

300
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,914
<i>I drove all that night</i>
<i>while Haskell slept like a log.</i>

301
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,418
<i>After a while, I began to get sleepy myself.</i>

302
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:01,673
<i>I was happy though.</i>
<i>Soon I'd be with Sue again.</i>

303
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,216
<i>The long trip was practically over,</i>

304
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,011
<i>and there'd be no more hoofing it</i>
<i>down the concrete.</i>

305
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,930
<i>I began to think of the future,</i>

306
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:12,100
<i>which couldn't have been brighter</i>
<i>if I'd embroidered it with neon lights.</i>

307
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,228
<i>It was nice to think of Sue shooting to the top.</i>

308
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,358
<i>It's amazing what a full belly</i>
<i>can do to your imagination.</i>

309
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:28,158
<i>♪ Your eyes are blue</i>
<i>Your kisses too ♪</i>

310
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:32,579
<i>♪ I never knew what they could do ♪</i>

311
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:39,669
<i>♪ I can't believe that you're in love with me ♪</i>

312
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:45,634
<i>♪ You're telling everyone you know ♪</i>

313

<i>♪ With me ♪</i>

316
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:12,953
Mr. Haskell.

317
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:15,705
Mr. Haskell?

318
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,877
Mr. Haskell, wake up! It's raining.

319
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,004
Don't you think we ought to stop
and put up the top?

320
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,265
Mr. Haskell, I'm gonna put up the top.

321
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,031
<i>Until then,</i>
<i>I'd done things my way.</i>

322
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,701
<i>But from then on, something else</i>
<i>stepped in and shunted me off</i>

323
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,537
<i>to a different destination</i>
<i>than the one I had picked for myself.</i>

324
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,331
<i>For when I pulled open that door...</i>

325
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,172
Mr. Haskell, what's the matter?
Are you hurt?

326
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,549
Are you hurt, Mr. Haskell?

327
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,469
<i>Start your sermon. I'll listen to it.</i>

328
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,015
<i>But I know what you're gonna hand me</i>
<i>even before you open your mouths.</i>

329
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,018
<i>You're gonna tell me you don't believe</i>
<i>my story of how Haskell died</i>

330
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,354
<i>and give me that "don't make me laugh"</i>
<i>expression on your smug faces.</i>

331
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,359
<i>I saw at once he was dead.</i>

332
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,195
<i>And I was in for it.</i>

333
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,113
<i>Who would believe he fell out of the car?</i>

334
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,740
<i>If Haskell came to, which,</i>
<i>of course, he couldn't,</i>

335
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:34,242
<i>even he would swear</i>
<i>I conked him over the head for his dough.</i>

336
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,493
<i>Yes, I was in for it.</i>

337
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,831
<i>Instinct told me to run,</i>
<i>but then I realized it was hopeless.</i>

338
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,000
<i>There were lots of people back down the road</i>
<i>who could identify me.</i>

339
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,002
<i>That gas station guy and the waitress.</i>

340
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,421
<i>I would be in a worse spot then</i>
<i>trying to explain why I beat it.</i>

341
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,383
<i>The next possibility was to sit tight</i>
<i>and tell the truth when the cops came.</i>

342
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,178
<i>But that would be crazy.</i>
<i>They'd laugh at the truth.</i>

343
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:54,554
<i>And I'd have my head in a noose.</i>

344
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,809
<i>So what else was there to do</i>
<i>but hide the body and get away in the car?</i>

345
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,103
<i>I couldn't leave the car there</i>
<i>with him in the gully.</i>

346
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,939
<i>That would be like erecting a tombstone.</i>

347
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,387
<i>My idea was to cover him with brush,</i>
<i>not to rob him.</i>

348
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:38,306
<i>But then I remembered that even if</i>
<i>I only drove the car for 100 miles or so,</i>

349
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,724
<i>I would need money for gas.</i>

350
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:44,062
<i>Besides, it was stupid of me</i>
<i>to leave all that money on a dead man.</i>

351
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,190
<i>Not only that,</i>
<i>I'd have to take his driver's license</i>

352
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,692
<i>in case I was stopped for something.</i>

353
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,237
<i>I didn't like to think about it,</i>

354
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,823
<i>but by that time I'd done</i>
<i>just what the police would say I did.</i>

355
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,742
<i>Even if I didn't... My clothes.</i>

356
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,620
<i>The owner of such an expensive car</i>
<i>would never be wearing them.</i>

357
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,248
<i>Some cop might pull me in on suspicion.</i>

358
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,233
Hey, you. This your car?

359
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,945
Don't you know better than to leave a car
with the wheels halfway in the middle of the road?

360
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,405
That's the way accidents happen.

361
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:38,616
I... I'm sorry, Officer.
I was just putting up my top.

362
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,369
- I didn't think.
- Well, the next time, think.

363
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,913
I'll let you go now,
but watch your step in the future.

364
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,416
I know that it's a lonely stretch,
but cars come by here once in a while.

365
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,336
- We have plenty of crack-ups.
- Thanks, Officer.

366
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,779
<i>I left nothing in the car</i>
<i>that'd give me away as Roberts.</i>

367
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,531
<i>If they found a dead man in the gully now,</i>
<i>it could be me.</i>

368
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,124
<i>As I drove off, it was still raining.</i>

369
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:31,878
<i>The drops streaked</i>
<i>down the windshield like tears.</i>

370
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,383
<i>I kept imagining I was being followed,</i>

371
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,343
<i>that I could hear sirens</i>
<i>back in the distance.</i>

372
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:43,473
<i>Just how long it took to cover the 60-odd</i>
<i>miles to the California state line,</i>

373
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,557
<i>I don't know.</i>

374
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,643
<i>I lost all track of time.</i>

375
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:51,272
<i>But the rain had stopped and the sun was up</i>
<i>when I pulled up to the inspection station.</i>

376
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,694
Hello.

377
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,948
- Carrying any fruits or vegetables?
- No.

378
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,200
- Any livestock or poultry?
- No.

379
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,204
I'd like to see your registration
and driver's license, please.

380
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,253
- Anything in the baggage compartment?
- Just baggage.

381
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:18,550
Charles Haskell Jr.
Age 30, brown eyes, dark hair.

382
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,218
Identifying marks, none.

383
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,096
- Are you Charles Haskell Jr.?
- Yes.

384
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,265
Well, remember, if you're employed,
and you stay over 30 days,

385
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,225
you take out California plates.

386
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,519
All right, Officer, but I'll only be
in the state a short while.

387
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,272
Right. You can go now.

388
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,115
<i>I couldn't drive any farther</i>
<i>without some sleep.</i>

389
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:45,785
<i>Cops or no cops, I knew</i>
<i>I had to hit the hay and hit it hard.</i>

390
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,205
<i>I was dead tired.</i>

391
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:20,945
No.

392
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,364
No, you can't, Mr. Haskell.

393
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,158
No.

394
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,376
<i>Mr. Haskell, you can't die.</i>

395
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,130
<i>They'll think... They'll think I did it.</i>

396
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,175
<i>No, Mr. Haskell.</i>

397
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,719
<i>No, no...</i>

398
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,235
Who's there?

399
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,612
It's the maid. Can I come in and clean?

400
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,324
Later... in a half-hour.

401
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,492
All right, sir.

402
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,601
<i>There was no time to lose.</i>

403
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,229
<i>Every minute I had to be Charles Haskell</i>
<i>was dangerous.</i>

404
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,523
<i>I'd have to be Charles Haskell</i>
<i>until I got to some city</i>

405
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,650
<i>where I could leave the car</i>
<i>and be swallowed up.</i>

406
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,866
<i>That meant driving the car</i>
<i>as far as San Bernardino,</i>

407
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,493
<i>maybe even to Los Angeles.</i>

408
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,453
<i>In a little town, I might be noticed.</i>

409
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,330
<i>But in a city, I should be safe enough.</i>

410
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,668
<i>Then, after I ditched the car,</i>
<i>I could go on to Sue.</i>

411
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,547
<i>But those five minutes at the state line</i>
<i>made me realize</i>

412
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,633
<i>it might be a good idea to find out</i>
<i>a little bit about Mr. Haskell.</i>

413
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,304
<i>Then if anybody asked me questions,</i>
<i>I could give the right answers.</i>

414
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,808
<i>The first thing I found out</i>
<i>was that I had $768.</i>

415
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:17,770
<i>This was a lot of jack, but believe me,</i>

416
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,897
<i>it was the kind of money</i>
<i>I'd rather not have.</i>

417
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:31,117
<i>And then I found out from a letter</i>
<i>Haskell was carting around in his bag</i>

418
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,786
<i>that he wasn't the openhanded,</i>
<i>easygoing big shot</i>

419
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,414
<i>who went around buying dinners</i>
<i>for strange hitchhikers.</i>

420
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,834
<i>Before I got done reading it,</i>
<i>I saw him more as a chiseler.</i>

421
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,838
<i>It was written</i>
<i>to his old man in California,</i>

422
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,798
<i>the one he hadn't seen in so many years.</i>

423
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:51,387
<i>In it, Haskell posed as a salesman...</i>
<i>of hymnals, of all things.</i>

424
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,390
<i>It was easy to see where Haskell expected</i>

425
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,851
<i>to raise a new stake</i>
<i>for his book in Miami—</i>

426
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,145
<i>by rooking his old man.</i>

427
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,691
<i>That was about all I found out</i>
<i>from his effects.</i>

428
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:04,859
<i>And it was enough.</i>

429
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:09,739
<i>I told myself maybe old man Haskell</i>
<i>was lucky his son kicked off.</i>

430
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,533
<i>He would never know it,</i>

431
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:16,079
<i>but it saved him from taking a flier</i>
<i>in sacred literature preferred.</i>

432
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,981
<i>Near the airport at Desert Center,</i>
<i>I pulled up for water.</i>

433
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,693
<i>There was a woman.</i>

434
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,616
Hey, you. Come on if you want a ride.

435
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,664
How far you goin'?

436
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,124
How far are you going?

437
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,794
<i>That took me by surprise.</i>
<i>I turned my head to look her over.</i>

438
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,590
<i>She was facing straight ahead,</i>
<i>so I couldn't see her eyes.</i>

439
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,760
<i>But she was young, not more than 24.</i>

440
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,846
<i>Man, she looked as if</i>
<i>she’d just been thrown off</i>

441
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,307
<i>the crummiest freight train in the world.</i>

442
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,643
<i>Yet, in spite of this,</i>
<i>I got the impression of beauty.</i>

443
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:06,022
<i>Not the beauty of a movie actress,</i>
<i>mind you,</i>

444
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,691
<i>or the beauty you dream about</i>
<i>when you're with your wife,</i>

445
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,067
<i>but a natural beauty,</i>

446
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:13,196
<i>a beauty that's almost homely</i>
<i>because it's so real.</i>

447
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,116
<i>Then, suddenly, she turned to face me.</i>

448
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,411
- How far did you say you were going?
- Los Angeles.

449
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:21,412
LA?

450
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:25,792
- LA's good enough for me, mister.
- That's what I was afraid of.

451
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:29,086
- What'd you say?
- Nothing. Just thinking out loud.

452
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,130
People get in trouble for doing that.

453
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,717
- What's your name?
- You can call me Vera, if you like.

454
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,178
- You live in Los Angeles?
- No.

455
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,557
- Where you coming from?
- Back there.

456
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,100
- Needles?
- No.

457
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:47,104
Sure. Phoenix.
You look just like a Phoenix girl.

458
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,857
Are the girls in Phoenix that bad?

459
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,776
<i>The girl must have been pretty tired</i>

460
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,946
<i>because she fell asleep not 20 minutes</i>
<i>after she stepped into the car.</i>

461
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:59,784
<i>She lay sprawled out with her head resting</i>
<i>against the far door, like Haskell.</i>

462
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:03,454
<i>I didn't like that part of it much,</i>
<i>but I didn't wake her up.</i>

463
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:06,874
<i>It wasn't that this girl still worried me.</i>

464
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,378
<i>I'd gotten over that funny feeling</i>
<i>I had when she looked at me,</i>

465
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:13,005
<i>which I put down</i>
<i>as just my jangled nerves.</i>

466
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,592
<i>With her eyes closed</i>
<i>and the tenseness gone out of her,</i>

467
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,135
<i>she seemed harmless enough.</i>

468
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,931
<i>Instead of disliking her,</i>
<i>I began to feel sorry for her.</i>

469
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,184
<i>The poor kid probably</i>
<i>had had a rough time of it.</i>

470
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,979
<i>Who was she, anyway?</i>

471
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:30,481
<i>And why was she going to Los Angeles?</i>

472
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:32,900
<i>And where'd she come from</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

473
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,777
<i>The only thing I knew about her</i>
<i>was her name.</i>

474
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,363
<i>Not that it made any difference.</i>

475
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,740
<i>A few hours more and we'd be in Hollywood.</i>

476
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,243
<i>I'd forget where I parked the car</i>
<i>and look up Sue.</i>

477
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,288
<i>This nightmare of being a dead man</i>
<i>would be over.</i>

478
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,833
<i>Who this dame was, well,</i>
<i>it was no business of mine.</i>

479
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:52,920
Where did you leave his body?
Where did you leave the owner of this car?

480
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,714
You're not fooling anyone.

481
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:58,175
This buggy belongs to a guy named Haskell.
That's not you, mister.

482
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:01,345
You're out of your mind. That's my name.
Charles Haskell. I can prove it.

483
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,514
- Here's my driver's license.
- Save yourself the trouble, mister.

484
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:05,850
Having Haskell's wallet
only makes it worse.

485
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,019
It just so happens
I rode with Charlie Haskell

486
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:09,687
all the way from Louisiana.

487
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,856
He picked me up outside of Shreveport.

488
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,566
- You rode —
- You heard me.

489
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,985
<i>Then it all came back to me.</i>

490
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,654
<i>All the talk about dueling</i>
<i>and scars and scratches.</i>

491
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,365
<i>There was no doubt about it.</i>

492
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,951
<i>Vera must be the woman</i>
<i>Haskell had mentioned.</i>

493
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:25,786
<i>She must have passed me while I slept.</i>

494
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,873
Well? Well, I'm waiting.

495
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,333
<i>My goose was cooked.</i>

496
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,084
<i>She had me.</i>

497
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,670
<i>That Haskell guy wasn't dead yet.</i>

498
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:38,174
<i>He wasn't stretched out stiff and cold</i>
<i>in any Arizona gully.</i>

499
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,427
<i>He was sitting right there in the car,</i>
<i>laughing like mad while he haunted me.</i>

500
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,305
Well?

501
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:47,516
<i>There was nothing I could say.</i>
<i>It was her move.</i>

502
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,144
<i>Vera, whatever her name was.</i>

503
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,480
<i>It was just my luck</i>
<i>picking her up on the road.</i>

504
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:56,150
<i>It couldn't have been Helen</i>
<i>or Mary or Evelyn or Ruth.</i>

505
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:59,528
<i>It had to be the very last person</i>
<i>I should ever have met.</i>

506
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:01,822
<i>That's life.</i>

507
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:05,493
<i>Whichever way you turn,</i>
<i>fate sticks out a foot to trip you.</i>

508
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,459
<i>I told her everything,</i>
<i>but she didn't believe my story.</i>

509
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,169
<i>I should've saved my breath.</i>

510
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,672
That's the greatest cock-and-bull story
I ever heard.

511
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:19,382
So he fell out of his car.

512
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:21,509
Say, who do you think
you're talking to, a hick?

513
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,594
Listen, mister. I've been around.

514
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:27,056
And I know a wrong guy when I see one.
What'd you do, kiss him with a wrench?

515
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,266
Now wait a minute.
What I told you was true.

516
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,893
You see, that's why I had to do it.

517
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,354
You think I killed him.
Well, the cops would've thought so too.

518
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,189
Yeah, well maybe they still think so.

519
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,484
What makes you so sure
I'll shut up about this?

520
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,320
Vera, I'm innocent.
Give me a break, will you?

521
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,490
It won't do me any good
having you pinched.

522
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,117
The cops are no friends of mine.

523
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:49,078
Now, if there was a reward...
But there isn't.

524
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,914
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

525
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:55,334
I'm not through with you by a long shot.
Let's see that roll.

526
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,676
Is that all Haskell had?

527
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,511
- Isn't it enough?
- No, I thought he had more.

528
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,847
Not that I know of. You can search me
if you think I'm holding out on you.

529
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,598
Well, maybe I will at that.

530
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,809
He told me he was gonna bet $3,000

531
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,562
on a horse named Paradisiacal
on Wednesday at Santa Anita.

532
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:16,981
- He was stringing you along. He meant 300.
- Maybe.

533
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:20,359
Sure. Three bucks, 300.
He was a piece of cheese, a big blowhard.

534
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:23,279
Listen, mister. Don't try and tell me
anything about Charlie Haskell.

535
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,281
Remember, I knew him better than you did.

536
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:28,075
Okay, then you knew he was a four-flusher.
That explains the three-grand bet.

537
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,578
I'm not so sure
he didn't have that three grand.

538
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:34,123
Why should I believe you?
You got all the earmarks of a cheap crook.

539
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:35,624
- Now, wait a minute.
- Shut up.

540
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,209
You're a cheap crook and you killed him.

541
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,420
For two cents,
I'd change my mind and turn you in.

542
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,796
I don't like you!

543
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,340
- All right, all right. Don't get sore.
- I'm not getting sore.

544
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,509
But just remember who's boss around here.

545
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,136
If you shut up
and don't give me any arguments,

546
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,679
you'll have nothing to worry about.

547
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,514
But if you act wise, well, mister,

548
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:53,184
you'll pop into jail so fast
it'll give you the bends.

549
00:39:53,267 --> 00:39:55,061
- I'm not arguing.
- Well, see that you don't.

550
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,479
You know, as crooked as you look,

551
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:59,607
I'd hate to see a fella as young as you
wind up sniffing that perfume

552
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,484
that Arizona hands out free to murderers.

553
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,235
- I'm not a murderer.
- Of course you're not.

554
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,695
Haskell knocked his own head off.

555
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:06,280
He fell. That's how it happened,
just like I told you.

556
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,532
Sure, and then he made you a present
of his belongings.

557
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,326
- I explained why—
- Skip it.

558
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,120
Doesn't make a difference one way
or another. I'm not a mourner.

559
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:15,414
I liked Haskell even less than I like you.

560
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:17,374
Yeah, I saw what you did to him.

561
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,543
- What do you mean?
- Those scratches on his wrists.

562
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:20,961
Sure, I scratched him.

563
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,130
I'll say you did.

564
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,675
So your idea was
to drive the car a little way,

565
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,969
maybe into San Bernardino,
and then leave it.

566
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,387
You weren't gonna sell it?

567
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,599
Sell it? You think I'm crazy?
Somebody else's car?

568
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:36,268
All I wanna do is leave it somewhere
and forget I ever saw it.

569
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,271
Not only don't you have any scruples,
you don't have any brains.

570
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,024
- I don't get you.
- Maybe it's a good thing you met me.

571
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,985
You would of got yourself caught, sure.
Why, you dope.

572
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:48,364
Don't you know a deserted automobile
always rates an investigation?

573
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,785
Look. The cops find a car.
Then they get curious.

574
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,495
They wonder where the owner is.

575
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:57,998
So, all right, they don't trace Haskell.
They trace you.

576
00:40:58,207 --> 00:40:59,792
I never thought of that.

577
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,628
The only safe way to get rid of the car
is to sell it to a dealer,

578
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,255
get it registered under a new name.

579
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:06,006
Say, stop at the next store.

580
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,884
I wanna get a bottle and do some shopping
before we hit LA.

581
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:12,221
Okay. Soon as we find a place,
I'll drop you off and pick you up later.

582
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,431
Nothin' doin'. You're coming in too.

583
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:17,351
From now on,
you and I are like the Siamese twins.

584
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,436
Have it your way,
but I don't get the point.

585
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,689
The point is I don't want you to get lost.

586
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:23,399
I'm not gonna beat it,
if that's what you're afraid of.

587
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,650
I'll say you're not.

588
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,570
Well, I'm gonna see that you sell this car
so you don't get caught.

589
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:31,448
Thanks. Of course, your interest
wouldn't be financial, would it?

590
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:33,701
You wouldn't want
a small percentage of the profits?

591
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:37,204
Well, now that you insist,
how can I refuse?

592
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:38,914
A hundred percent'll do.

593
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:40,875
Fine. I'm relieved.

594
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:43,210
I thought for a moment
you were gonna take it all.

595
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:44,712
I don't want to be a hog.

596
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:48,674
<i>A few hours later,</i>
<i>we were in Hollywood.</i>

597
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,468
<i>I was recognizing places</i>
<i>Sue had written about.</i>

598
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:55,014
<i>It struck me that,</i>
<i>far from being at the end of the trip,</i>

599
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:58,100
<i>there was a greater distance between Sue</i>
<i>and me than when I started out.</i>

600
00:41:59,435 --> 00:42:02,062
<i>Vera wasn't kidding</i>
<i>with that Siamese twins crack.</i>

601
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:06,108
<i>She rented a little apartment</i>
<i>as Mrs. Charles Haskell.</i>

602
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:10,112
<i>When I objected to this, she explained</i>
<i>that it was on account of the car.</i>

603
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,156
<i>A dealer might think something was funny</i>

604
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,533
<i>if he called and found</i>
<i>we were using different names.</i>

605
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:21,540
- Home, sweet home.
- Yeah.

606
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,500
Not bad, either.

607
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,844
In case there's any doubt in your mind,
I'll take the bedroom.

608
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,179
Yeah.

609
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:37,848
Sure is stuffy in here.

610
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,691
- Keep the window shut.
- Okay.

611
00:42:50,027 --> 00:42:53,489
The old crow downstairs said
there's a folding bed behind this door.

612
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,704
You know how to work it?

613
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:05,542
I invented it.

614
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:11,632
- Some joint.
- One can't have everything.

615
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,389
I'm first in the bathtub.

616
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,142
I don't know why,
but I figured you would be.

617
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:35,572
Boy, boy.
It sure feels good to be clean again.

618
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,409
I must be ten pounds lighter.

619
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:40,452
You must be.

620
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:45,374
Well, hitchin' rides isn't exactly the way
you keep your schoolgirl complexion.

621
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,714
I wish that guy with the sax
would give up.

622
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:54,425
It gets on my nerves.

623
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,511
Forget it.

624
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,181
Have a drink.

625
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:04,143
Aren't you afraid
I'm gonna take you up on it?

626
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,564
If I didn't wanna give you a drink,
I wouldn't have offered it.

627
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:12,985
Why be a sorehead, Roberts?
You got yourself into this thing.

628
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,904
You should be grateful
I'm not turning you in.

629
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,116
Why, if I wasn't regular,
you'd be in the pen this minute

630
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,286
being photographed, fingerprinted,
and being pushed around by the cops.

631
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,622
So cheer up. Get rid of that long puss.

632
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,668
Or is your conscience bothering you?

633
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:35,507
No.

634
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:37,384
It isn't.

635
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:39,470
Swell. That's the spirit.

636
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:43,182
He's dead,
and no moaning around will bring him back.

637
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:50,314
Anyway, I never could understand this worrying
about something that's over and done with.

638
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,441
Now look, Vera.
For the last time, I didn't kill him.

639
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,984
Haskell was a sick man.

640
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:56,111
Maybe he was dead before he fell
out of the car. I don't know.

641
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:58,405
Sure, sure. He died of old age.

642
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:00,366
All right.

643
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:02,826
So if it'll make you sociable...

644
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:05,829
you didn't kill him.

645
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:17,299
Thanks.

646
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,188
- We're outta liquor, Roberts.
- Yeah.

647
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,442
Too bad.
I felt like getting tight tonight.

648
00:45:35,526 --> 00:45:37,569
Well, I think you succeeded.

649
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:40,739
- Am I tight?
- As a prima donna's corset.

650
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,199
That's good.

651
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:44,076
I wanted to get tight.

652
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,787
Why? What have you got to get tight about?

653
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,248
I don't know. A few things.

654
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,044
You should have my worries.

655
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:56,672
If I had your troubles, I'd stay sober.

656
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,382
And I've got the key to that door.

657
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,680
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

658
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,390
I'm always right.

659
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,185
You know, I don't like your attitude,
Roberts.

660
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:12,020
Well, there's a lot of things I don't like.

661
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,815
Say...

662
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:19,278
But life's like a ball game.

663
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:21,113
You got to take a swing
at whatever comes along

664
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:23,615
before you wake up
and find it's the ninth inning.

665
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:25,784
Bet you read that somewhere.

666
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:29,705
That's the trouble with you, Roberts.
All you do is bellyache.

667
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:35,502
You could have taken it easy and,
well, try and make the best of things.

668
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:38,380
But maybe that's what's wrong
with the whole world.

669
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,299
Get the professor.

670
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:43,135
People knock themselves out
trying to buck fate.

671
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:46,388
Now take you, for instance.
You're lucky to be alive.

672
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:49,057
Why, suppose Haskell had pulled open
your door?

673
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:51,852
You'd be playing a harp now.
Think of that.

674
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:56,857
You think of it. I'm tired of thinking.

675
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,818
There's plenty of people dying this minute

676
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:02,404
that would give anything
to trade places with you.

677
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,991
I know what I'm talking about.

678
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:10,746
I'm not so sure.
At least they know they're done for.

679
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,582
They don't just sweat blood
wondering if they are.

680
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,752
Your philosophy stinks, pal.

681
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:21,798
We all know we're gonna kick off someday.
It's only a question of when.

682
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:26,553
But what got us on this subject anyway?

683
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,555
We'll be discussing politics next.

684
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,474
Yeah.

685
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:33,435
Where'd you hide the butts?

686
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:35,938
On the table, sucker.

687
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:47,115
<i>We bored each other with</i>
<i>conversation for a couple of hours longer.</i>

688
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,410
<i>Every five minutes, one of us was wishing</i>
<i>we had another bottle or a radio</i>

689
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:52,120
<i>or something to read.</i>

690
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,249
<i>Then finally we ran out of chat.</i>

691
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,501
I know it's only eleven o'clock,

692
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,087
but I want to get up early
and make the rounds to the used car lots.

693
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,090
No hurry about that.
We got all the time in the world.

694
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,259
Maybe you have, but if you think
I want to stay cooped up in this place

695
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:06,927
any longer than I have to, you're batty.

696
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,264
It's not a bad place. Pay plenty
for diggings like this in New York.

697
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:12,349
I wouldn't like it if it was the Ritz.

698
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,146
Rotten liquor.

699
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,983
You got a mean cough.
Ought to do something about it.

700
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,317
I'll be all right.

701
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:23,819
That's what Camille said.

702
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,654
Who?

703
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,197
Nobody you know.

704
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,370
- Wasn't that the dame that died of consumption?
- Yeah.

705
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:37,291
Wouldn't it be a break for you
if I did kick off.

706
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:40,335
You'd be free
with all Haskell's dough and car.

707
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:42,045
I don't want to see anybody die.

708
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:44,923
Not even me?

709
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:48,010
Especially not you. One person died on me.

710
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:50,512
If you did, well, that's all I need.

711
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:54,224
You don't like me, do you, Roberts?

712
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:56,977
Like you?

713
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,771
I love you.

714
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,983
My favorite sport is being kept prisoner.

715
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:07,487
After we sell the car, you can go to blazes
for all I care, but not until then.

716
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,538
I'm going to bed.

717
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,465
Good night, Roberts.

718
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:29,551
Don't try and sneak away during the night.
All the doors are locked.

719
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:33,138
Anyway, if I find you gone in the morning,
I'll notify the police.

720
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,891
- They'll pick you up.
- Don't worry. I know when I'm in a spot.

721
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:40,937
Well, good night. I hope that portable
rack isn't too uncomfortable for you.

722
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,148
Don't lose any sleep over it,
will you, Vera?

723
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:21,937
CRestview...

724
00:50:23,814 --> 00:50:29,653
6... 5... 7,

725
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,656
2... 3.

726
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,075
Hello?

727
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:37,119
Hello!

728
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:39,413
<i>Hello?</i>

729
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,748
<i>Hello?</i>

730
00:50:48,296 --> 00:50:51,883
No. Not yet, darling.

731
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,511
Tomorrow.

732
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:56,930
Maybe.

733
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:01,893
<i>If this were fiction,</i>

734
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:05,564
<i>I would fall in love with her, marry her,</i>
<i>and make a respectable woman of her,</i>

735
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:09,818
<i>or else she'd make some supreme,</i>
<i>class-A sacrifice for me and die.</i>

736
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:13,363
<i>Sue and I would ball a little</i>
<i>over her grave</i>

737
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:16,450
<i>and make some crack about</i>
<i>"there's good in all of us."</i>

738
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:20,162
<i>But Vera, unfortunately,</i>
<i>was just as rotten in the morning</i>

739
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:21,872
<i>as she'd been the night before.</i>

740
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,417
All right, all right, I'm coming.

741
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,461
Look, Vera, it's almost noon.

742
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,256
So what?
The dealers will be there all day.

743
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:34,009
They'll be there all year too, but it
doesn't mean I'm gonna wait that long.

744
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,553
Shut up.
You're making noises like a husband.

745
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:42,934
- Well, do I rate a whistle?
- You sure do, but let's go.

746
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:46,521
Let's go, let's go. I spend 85 bucks
and two hours preparing bait,

747
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:48,190
and all you can say is "Let's go."

748
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:51,276
Come on.

749
00:51:56,072 --> 00:51:58,700
We passed a few used car lots
last night down this way.

750
00:51:58,784 --> 00:52:00,786
What do you think
we can get for this heap?

751
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:04,498
I don't know. Plenty.
You just let me handle everything.

752
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,208
You think we can get $2,000?

753
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,709
I don't know. But don't worry.

754
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:10,128
I'll squeeze as much
out of this guy as I can.

755
00:52:10,212 --> 00:52:13,298
If I let it go cheap without a fight,
he might think we've stolen the car.

756
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:17,677
And listen, don't make any slips
and call me Roberts. That'll cook us.

757
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,638
I don't need you to tell me that.

758
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:21,932
You better just sit by
and keep your mouth closed.

759
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,017
Remember, we're both in the soup
if anything happens.

760
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,644
Forget it and drive.

761
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,146
You're my wife — Vera Haskell.

762
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,317
Look, after the deal's closed, let's go
back to that place on Hollywood Boulevard

763
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,944
where I saw the fur jacket.

764
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:35,237
I want to buy it.

765
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,989
After the deal's closed,
I'm saying good-bye to you.

766
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:41,493
That's right. I forgot.
I guess I'm getting kind of used to you.

767
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:45,038
Well, that's a habit
you can start breaking.

768
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,457
Let's try this place
in the middle of the block.

769
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:55,131
Good afternoon. What can I do for you?

770
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:58,510
- We're interested in selling a car.
- If the price is right.

771
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:05,475
Well, if it's in good mechanical condition,
it should blue book for about 1,600.

772
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:07,894
Tony, take a look at this motor.

773
00:53:07,978 --> 00:53:10,230
1,600. Are you kidding?

774
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:23,285
Well, maybe 1,850.

775
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:26,746
Before I let it go for 1,850, I'll wreck it
and collect the insurance first.

776
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:33,378
Lady, this motor's seen a lot of driving.

777
00:53:39,926 --> 00:53:43,221
<i>While the mechanic</i>
<i>inspected the car, we haggled.</i>

778
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:46,975
<i>At last, when we were all worn out,</i>
<i>we hit a compromise —</i>

779
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:48,602
<i>his price.</i>

780
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:53,106
Okay, it's a deal.

781
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:56,526
- Come in, we'll sign the papers.
- I have the ownership papers here with me.

782
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,321
Look, Vera, in the meantime,
will you clean out the dash compartment?

783
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:02,198
- There may be some stuff in it.
- All right, darling.

784
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,536
1,850 bucks.

785
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,246
That dirty cr —

786
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:17,422
- New York?
- Yeah.

787
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,759
- But you bought the car in Miami?
- Yeah.

788
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,469
Well, now, let's see about the insurance.

789
00:54:22,552 --> 00:54:24,554
We can either have it transferred
or canceled.

790
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:27,265
What kind of insurance do you have,
Mr. Haskell?

791
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:31,561
Well, aren't all the papers there?

792
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,859
I don't see any. Surely you know what type
of insurance you carry on the car.

793
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:39,444
The name of the company?

794
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,488
Yeah, but —

795
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:43,323
Well, if you'll just tell me
the name of the company,

796
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:45,116
I'd be very glad to take care
of all the details.

797
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,326
Well —

798
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,411
- Did you sign the papers yet?
- Not yet.

799
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,538
Well, don't. We're not selling the car.

800
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:52,540
- Well, wait a minute, Mrs. Haskell —
- Come on, darling.

801
00:54:52,624 --> 00:54:55,919
- What's the matter? Change your mind?
- Yes. I'm sorry. I guess I have.

802
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,379
- But, Vera —
- Let's go.

803
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:06,638
You got me out of a tight spot, Vera,
but I still don't understand all this.

804
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,724
You will in a minute.
I almost threw away a gold mine.

805
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:13,728
1,850 isn't to be sneezed at. The car
doesn't book for as much as I thought.

806
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:15,480
We're not selling the car.

807
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,440
You want to keep it?
Now wait a minute, Vera.

808
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:20,610
You said yourself I wouldn't be safe
until the car was in someone else's name.

809
00:55:20,694 --> 00:55:22,362
I'd like to be free of this mess
when I go.

810
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:24,614
That's just it, Roberts. You're not going.

811
00:55:25,532 --> 00:55:27,367
There's a drive-in at the next corner.

812
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,203
Pull in there and we'll get a bite to eat
and I'll explain.

813
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,455
What is this,
another one of your brilliant ideas?

814
00:55:38,795 --> 00:55:41,673
- Hello. May I take your order?
- Make mine a ham sandwich and coffee.

815
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:44,342
- And for you, sir?
- I don't care. The same.

816
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:47,721
Thank you.

817
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:55,228
Get this, Vera,
I've been pretty patient so far.

818
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,313
I've done everything you asked me to do,
but no more.

819
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:59,566
- Shut up.
- You've taken Haskell's money.

820
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:01,526
And you can have the dough we get
from selling the car,

821
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,194
but you're not gonna keep me a prisoner.

822
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:05,071
It's a good thing I bought the paper.
Look at that.

823
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:07,032
- Vera, I'm in no mood —
- Read that.

824
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:19,294
- No.
- Yes.

825
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:20,962
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

826
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:23,256
You think I'm crazy.
It's impossible, I tell ya.

827
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:25,175
Excuse me.

828
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,140
Blow the horn when you're through.

829
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:38,563
No one could possibly get away with an act
like that. Be wise to me in a minute.

830
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:39,814
Don't be yellow.

831
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:42,692
You look enough like him.
The same coloring and the same build.

832
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:44,360
See how his clothes fit ya?

833
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:46,237
No kidding. You almost
had me fooled for a while.

834
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:47,530
Grow up, Vera.

835
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:50,408
Don't you think a father knows his own
son? There must be other relatives.

836
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:53,328
The father won't have to know ya.
We'll wait till he gives up the ghost.

837
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,413
He's an old geezer
and he won't pull through.

838
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:59,375
And as far as the relatives are concerned,
they haven't seen you in 15 or 20 years.

839
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:02,587
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

840
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:06,132
- And I won't do it.
- It's not as tough as it sounds.

841
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:08,051
Remember, you've got
all kinds of identification —

842
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:09,135
his car, letters, license —

843
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:11,763
I could never get away with it.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

844
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,890
The old boy has scads of dough.

845
00:57:13,973 --> 00:57:17,143
Look in the paper there. Personal fortune
assessed at over 15 million.

846
00:57:17,227 --> 00:57:18,686
He'll leave plenty, I tell ya.

847
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,939
Maybe he cut off his son.
How do we know?

848
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:23,608
It's out, Vera.
I won't have anything to do with it.

849
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:27,070
I think you will.

850
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:30,698
Look, Vera, I'll do anything
within reason, but not that.

851
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:32,700
So forget it or find yourself another stooge.

852
00:57:32,784 --> 00:57:34,035
You sap!

853
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:36,913
You'll be fixed for the rest of your life
as Charlie Haskell.

854
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:40,083
You can take your inheritance and go away.
No more worrying about the rent.

855
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,293
No sweating, scheming, wondering
where your next meal's coming from!

856
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,419
Think about that, Roberts!

857
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:46,297
Vera, please. You're talking too loud.

858
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:49,300
On this I'm splitting 50-50 with you.
Sure, why not?

859
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:51,052
We're both alike.
Both born in the same gutter.

860
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,303
Now take it easy, Vera.

861
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:54,639
There's people around here.
You don't know what you're talking —

862
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:59,686
We'll wait till we read that old man
Haskell's dead. Then you show up.

863
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:02,063
Like you read in New York
that he was sick.

864
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:04,774
No! Suppose he doesn't die?

865
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:06,943
He will. I know he will.
Something tells me.

866
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:12,407
<i>But as much as I insisted</i>
<i>I would have no part of her scheme,</i>

867
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,450
<i>Vera was taking it for granted I would.</i>

868
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:19,956
<i>Neither of us had our mind on the cards</i>
<i>as we played that night.</i>

869
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,209
<i>I knew we were just trying to kill time</i>
<i>between newspaper editions.</i>

870
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:26,004
<i>This was a deathwatch for Vera.</i>

871
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:28,715
<i>Maybe it was for me too.</i>

872
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,385
Don't you realize if I'm caught they'll want
to know where I got the car and stuff?

873
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:35,597
- Then they'll have me on a murder charge.
- If you're smart, you won't get caught.

874
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,056
I knock with seven.

875
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,350
And if I'm caught,
don't you realize you'll be out too?

876
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:42,937
Eighteen points. That gives me 30.

877
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:45,440
How will I be out?

878
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:47,984
You'll be out $1,850 we would have gotten
on the car.

879
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,485
Really, Vera, you'd be an awful chump

880
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,571
if you threw away all that dough
on a dizzy long shot.

881
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:52,906
Let me sell the bus tomorrow.

882
00:58:52,989 --> 00:58:54,657
With the money it'll bring
and what you've already got,

883
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:56,451
a clever kid like you
can run it up in no time.

884
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:59,037
- Then we'd both be in the clear.
- I'll be in the clear anyway.

885
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,914
Maybe. Maybe.

886
00:59:00,997 --> 00:59:02,582
But if I got caught —

887
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,085
- I'd get good and sore at you, you know.
- You mean you'd squeal?

888
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,379
- Well, no, not squeal exactly—
- Never mind what you meant!

889
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:14,427
Even if you did tell the cops
I was in on it with you,

890
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:15,887
what could they do to me?

891
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,349
They might give me the same medicine
they gave you.

892
00:59:19,432 --> 00:59:21,142
- Yeah.
- A rope.

893
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:25,772
But I'm on my way anyhow.

894
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,734
All they'll be doing will be rushing it.

895
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,820
All right. But think of the 1,850 you'd lose.

896
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,657
You'd kick yourself along the block
if you let that get away from you.

897
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,660
I'll take the chance. Want another drink?

898
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:41,746
You're being a goon. That's the way
people wind up behind the eight ball.

899
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,332
Once they get a few dollars,
they become greedy and want more.

900
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:45,708
My, my.

901
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:46,793
- Caesar.
- Who?

902
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:49,587
You know, that Roman general?
He got his for being greedy.

903
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:52,840
He wasn't satisfied.
So the final windup was he took the count.

904
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:55,301
A couple of days ago you didn't have a dime.

905
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:58,221
Why, you were so broke
you couldn't pay cash for a postage stamp.

906
00:59:58,304 --> 01:00:01,349
Now you've got almost $700,
with 1,850 in the offing.

907
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:03,101
Take my advice. Don't try for more.

908
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:05,770
I'm tired of this game.
Let's have some blackjack.

909
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:06,688
Play solitaire.

910
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,315
- I will, if that's the way you feel about it.
- That's the way I feel about it.

911
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:11,609
Getting sore and throwing things
won't help much, Roberts.

912
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:15,113
I'm merely doing you a favor. I help you out of
a jam by keepin' my mouth shut.

913
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:18,074
I show you how to make some soft money,
and what thanks do I get?

914
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,158
- Thanks?
- Sure.

915
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:21,661
Or would you rather I called the cops and told
them you killed a man and stole his money?

916
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:22,829
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Yes, you did.

917
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:25,707
- No, I didn't. You know I didn't.
- All right, then.

918
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,253
Suppose I call the cops?

919
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:32,922
If you're innocent,
what do you got to be scared of?

920
01:00:33,006 --> 01:00:36,592
Okay, call 'em, you mutt. Go ahead and call 'em.
See if I care.

921
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:39,554
- At least they'll give me a square deal.
- You want me to call 'em?

922
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:43,599
You heard me. But I'm warning ya.
If I'm pinched, I'll swear you were in on it.

923
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:46,978
I'll say that you helped me.
If I'm frying, I'll get even with you.

924
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,688
You wouldn't dare. You're chicken!

925
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:52,817
Yeah? Then try it and see.
Call 'em. Yeah.

926
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,069
Okay, I will.

927
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:09,917
Information.

928
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:12,837
I want the number
of the Hollywood police station.

929
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:16,758
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

930
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,679
Wait a minute, Vera. You wouldn't do that.

931
01:01:21,763 --> 01:01:23,723
Wouldn't I? Give me that
and I'll show you if I would!

932
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,683
Take it easy now. Let's talk this over.

933
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:27,560
<i>This was early in the evening.</i>

934
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:32,148
<i>And the conversation, while hectic,</i>
<i>was at least pitched low.</i>

935
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:36,778
<i>But as the minutes passed and more obstacles</i>
<i>to her plan popped into my head,</i>

936
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,488
<i>the air got blue.</i>

937
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:41,824
<i>Each word coming from our lips</i>
<i>cracked like a whip.</i>

938
01:01:41,908 --> 01:01:45,787
<i>I reminded her that as Charles Haskell</i>
<i>I didn't even know my mother's name,</i>

939
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,580
<i>where I'd gone to school,</i>

940
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:49,415
<i>the name of my best friend,</i>

941
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:51,417
<i>whether I had an Aunt Emma or not,</i>

942
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:54,796
<i>my religion, and if I'd ever owned a dog.</i>

943
01:01:54,879 --> 01:01:57,465
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>what my middle initial stood for.</i>

944
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:00,927
<i>I also pointed out that the real Haskell</i>
<i>had a scar on his forearm.</i>

945
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,304
His people never saw that scar.

946
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:05,598
He told me he ran away
right after putting out the kid's eye.

947
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:08,142
Yeah, but his father knew he was cut.
There'd have to be some kind of mark.

948
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,436
So what?

949
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,440
The old man's dead or will be.
I hope by tomorrow morning's papers.

950
01:02:14,524 --> 01:02:18,027
Anyway, you could cut yourself
a little, couldn't ya?

951
01:02:19,028 --> 01:02:22,323
Boy, for that kind of dough,
I'd let you cut my leg off.

952
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:23,991
You're drunk and you're crazy mad, Vera.

953
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,035
Turn me in if you want to,
but I won't get mixed up in this.

954
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:28,162
Besides, how do we know?
Haskell was such a phony.

955
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:30,373
Maybe he wasn't the man's son at all.
Maybe he just dreamed it up.

956
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:35,920
Well, dreaming or not, you won't be dreaming
when the law taps you on the shoulder.

957
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:39,590
There's a cute little gas chamber
waiting for you, Roberts.

958
01:02:39,674 --> 01:02:43,136
And I hear extradition to Arizona's a cinch.

959
01:02:43,219 --> 01:02:45,054
Where's that phone?

960
01:02:45,138 --> 01:02:46,514
- Vera.
- Leave me alone!

961
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:50,059
- Vera!
- I wanna phone, call the police.

962
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:54,814
I hate you, you stinker.
You leave me alone!

963
01:02:54,897 --> 01:02:57,108
I'll let you alone when you promise to leave
the phone where it is.

964
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,152
- You're drunk. You don't know what you're doing.
- You're hurting me.

965
01:02:59,235 --> 01:03:00,862
Will you promise?

966
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:02,530
All right.

967
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:10,329
- You hurt me.
- I'm sorry, but —

968
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:13,374
- And it's hot in here! Open up a window!
- It's not hot!

969
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:16,127
Don't tell me!
Now do you do it or do I do it?

970
01:03:18,087 --> 01:03:19,839
You're no gentleman, see?

971
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:23,301
Yeah. All right, I'll open up the window.

972
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:27,513
Vera!

973
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:34,645
Vera, open the door.
Please open the door.

974
01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:36,856
Vera, open the door.
Don't use the phone. Listen to me.

975
01:03:37,523 --> 01:03:40,985
I don't like you, Roberts.
You're no gentleman, see?

976
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:45,156
You hurt my hand,
and I'm gonna get even with you.

977
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:48,409
If you don't open the door,
I'm gonna kick it down, Vera.

978
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:51,370
Vera, don't call the cops.
Listen to me, I'll do anything you say.

979
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,748
Vera, let me in!

980
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,667
I'll break the phone!

981
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,945
Vera.

982
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,541
<i>The world is full of skeptics.</i>

983
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,669
<i>I know. I'm one myself.</i>

984
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,714
<i>In the Haskell business, how many of you</i>
<i>would believe he fell out of the car?</i>

985
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:46,175
<i>And now, after killing Vera</i>
<i>without really meaning to do it,</i>

986
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:48,678
<i>how many of you would believe</i>
<i>it wasn't premeditated?</i>

987
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,266
<i>In a jury room, every last man of you</i>
<i>would go down shouting</i>

988
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:56,060
<i>that she had me over a barrel</i>
<i>and my only out was force.</i>

989
01:04:58,104 --> 01:04:59,730
<i>The room was still.</i>

990
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:03,693
<i>So quiet that for a while I'd wondered</i>
<i>if I'd suddenly gone deaf.</i>

991
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:06,237
<i>It was pure fear, of course.</i>

992
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,197
<i>And I was hysterical,</i>

993
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:09,991
<i>but without making a sound.</i>

994
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:14,287
<i>Vera was dead, and I was her murderer.</i>

995
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:19,875
<i>Murderer. What an awful word that is.</i>
<i>But I'd become one.</i>

996
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:22,044
<i>I'd better not get caught.</i>

997
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:24,630
<i>What evidence there was around the place</i>
<i>had to be destroyed.</i>

998
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:26,507
<i>And from the looks of things, there was plenty.</i>

999
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:28,301
<i>Looking around the room at things we'd bought</i>

1000
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:30,803
<i>was like looking into the faces of</i>
<i>a hundred people who'd seen us together</i>

1001
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,805
<i>and who remembered me.</i>

1002
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,308
<i>This was the kind of testimony</i>
<i>I couldn't rub out.</i>

1003
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:38,060
<i>No.</i>

1004
01:05:38,144 --> 01:05:41,314
<i>I could burn clothes and hide bottles</i>
<i>for the next five years.</i>

1005
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:42,857
<i>There'd always be witnesses.</i>

1006
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,734
<i>The landlady for one.</i>
<i>She could identify me.</i>

1007
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,235
<i>The car dealer, the waitress in the drive-in,</i>

1008
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,821
<i>the girl in the dress shop,</i>
<i>and that guy in the liquor store.</i>

1009
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,698
<i>They could all identify me.</i>

1010
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:55,870
<i>I was cooked. Done for.</i>
<i>I had to get out of there.</i>

1011
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,332
<i>While once I remained beside a dead body</i>

1012
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:02,418
<i>planning carefully how to avoid</i>
<i>being accused of killing him,</i>

1013
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:04,754
<i>this time I couldn't.</i>

1014
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:06,505
<i>This time I was guilty.</i>

1015
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:09,925
<i>I knew it. Felt it.</i>

1016
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:13,220
<i>I was like a guy suffering from shock.</i>

1017
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:14,972
<i>Things were whirling around in my head.</i>

1018
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:17,892
<i>I couldn't make myself think right.</i>

1019
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:21,437
<i>All I could think of was the guy with</i>
<i>the saxophone and what he was playing.</i>

1020
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:24,023
<i>It wasn't a love song anymore.</i>

1021
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:26,567
<i>It was a dirge.</i>

1022
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:16,617
<i>But my problems weren't solved.</i>

1023
01:07:16,701 --> 01:07:19,495
<i>I had to stay away from New York</i>
<i>for all time.</i>

1024
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:23,624
<i>Because Al Roberts was listed as dead</i>
<i>and had to stay dead.</i>

1025
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,001
<i>And I could never go back to Hollywood.</i>

1026
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:28,796
<i>Someone might recognize me as Haskell.</i>

1027
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:33,050
<i>Then, too, there was Sue.</i>

1028
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:37,805
<i>I could never go to her with a thing</i>
<i>like this hanging over my head.</i>

1029
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:42,476
<i>All I could do was pray she'd be happy.</i>

1030
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:57,658
<i>I was in Bakersfield before I read</i>
<i>that Vera's body was discovered.</i>

1031
01:07:57,742 --> 01:08:01,370
<i>And that the police were looking for Haskell</i>
<i>in connection with his wife's murder.</i>

1032
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:04,415
<i>Isn't that a laugh?</i>

1033
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:09,003
<i>Haskell got me into this mess</i>
<i>and Haskell was getting me out of it.</i>

1034
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,172
<i>The police were searching for a dead man.</i>

1035
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:16,886
<i>I keep trying to forget what happened...</i>

1036
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:22,975
<i>and wonder what my life might have been</i>
<i>if that car of Haskell’s hadn't stopped.</i>

1037
01:08:24,769 --> 01:08:26,937
<i>But one thing I don't have to wonder about.</i>

1038
01:08:28,147 --> 01:08:29,607
<i>I know.</i>

1039
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:34,236
<i>Someday a car will stop to pick me up</i>
<i>that I never thumbed.</i>

1040
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,867
<i>Yes.</i>

1041
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:44,413
<i>Fate... or some mysterious force</i>

1042
01:08:44,497 --> 01:08:47,416
<i>can put the finger on you or me</i>

1043
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,502
<i>for no good reason at all.</i>
