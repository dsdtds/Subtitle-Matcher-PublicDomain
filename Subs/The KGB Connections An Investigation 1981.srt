doubled in the last 10 years from 1970

early 1980 the Soviet presence had

164
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,139
almost doubled there was a time when I

165
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,120
first was in in the work where we could

166
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,319
almost go

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,860
One agent on one identified or suspected

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,819
Soviet intelligence officer when I left

169
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,500
quite the contrary was true and we were

170
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,720
vastly outnumbered where we our agents

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
were trying to cover three or four known

172
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,139
or suspected Intelligence Officers

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,759
s for Soviet diplomats is to file travel

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,400
plans whenever they travel in the U.S or

176
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Canada

177
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,580
it is a restriction that in the Soviet

178
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,919
Union is strictly applied to Western

179
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,800
diplomats but for the Soviets in North

180
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,840
America the theory and the practice

181
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
seldom meet

182
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,919
we find through our coverage of them

183
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,319
that they often deviate from those

184
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,139
travel plans and surprisingly enough

185
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,400
will end up

186
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,039
traveling via the sac base in Omaha

187
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,780
Nebraska when their travel plans call

188
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,699
for them to go through Kansas or some

189
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,039
other some other route and that's a

190
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,199
violation of travel regulations if we

191
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,400
bring it to the attention the state

192
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,440
department then a strong note of protest

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,140
is made to the Soviet ambassador

194
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,659
is there anything ever done about these

195
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,120
strong notes of protests

196
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,020
they're filed

197
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,830
um

198
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,580
[Music]

199
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,580
the Soviet Embassy in Washington is also

200
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,620
distinctive for another type of spying

201
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,760
operation

202
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,220
on the roof is a large antenna that

203
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,320
appears harmless but is used to

204
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,180
electronically eavesdrop on telephone

205
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,200
conversations in the Washington area

206
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,120
one-third of all local calls and most

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,700
long distance calls are transmitted by

208
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,740
microwave which can be plucked from the

209
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,380
air by these Soviet antennae

210
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,959
literally millions of calls are recorded

211
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,180
and put through computers which are

212
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,279
programmed to listen for certain key

213
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,920
words or are activated by the phone

214
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,680
numbers of people who are of interest to

215
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,399
the Soviets

216
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,380
in 1972 while negotiating a purchase of

217
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,839
surplus grain from the United States the

218
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,459
Soviet Embassy used its telephone

219
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,220
intercept capability to eavesdrop on

220
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,899
conversations between the U.S department

221
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,420
of Agriculture and grain dealers in the

222
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,000
midwest because the Soviets were able to

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,220
acquire inside information about the U.S

224
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,200
bargaining position they were able to

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,839
outmaneuver the U.S negotiators and sign

226
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,420
a long-term contract for a record amount

227
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,880
of grain at very low prices

228
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,220
crop failures the next year in the U.S

229
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,620
drove consumer prices upwards but the

230
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,480
Soviets were able to continue buying

231
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,100
grain at the low prices they had

232
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,339
negotiated the previous year

233
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,740
in San Francisco the Soviet consulate

234
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,480
houses sophisticated electronic

235
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,580
equipment and occupies a commanding

236
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,800
position overlooking San Francisco Bay

237
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,440
our investigations determined that many

238
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,060
of those antenna were in such a position

239
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,459
that they had the capability of doing

240
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,060
microwave Intercept in Silicon Valley

241
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,580
about an hour's Drive South of San

242
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,500
Francisco is the area that has come to

243
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,060
be known as Silicon Valley

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,380
it is perhaps the most highly

245
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,600
concentrated area of modern technology

246
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,060
and research in the United States

247
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,160
its products include microcomputers

248
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,880
silicon chips and fiber optics all vital

249
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,920
component parts of military hardware

250
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,980
the San Francisco consulate has also

251
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,899
provided the Soviets with an easy access

252
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,180
to U.S military establishments on the

253
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,880
west coast for example by observing the

254
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,160
Polaris submarines being refitted in

255
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,899
clear view of a nearby seafood

256
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,720
restaurant frequented by the Soviets the

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,700
numbers of American submarines then at

258
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,640
Sea can be determined

259
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,100
in the Canadian Capital the Soviet

260
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,670

[Music]

262
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,200
however the most visible microwave

263
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,240
intercept equipment is not on the Soviet

264
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,279
roof but nearby on the roof of the

265
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,620
polish Embassy it is the Eastern Bloc

267
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,700
East Germans that play an important part

268
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,940
in the game of espionage

269
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,519
William Kelly is the former head of the

270
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,920
RCMP security service

271
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,959
intelligence Services of blocked

272
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,100
countries

273
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,800
allegedly work independently of each

274
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,060
other

275
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,980
but that isn't true

276
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,959
they work very closely with each other

277
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,040
and under the dominance of the Russian

278
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,060
KGB there was a time when

279
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,440
the uh it was felt that the KGB were too

280
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,320
well known around external affairs

281
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,959
and they didn't think that their their

282
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,000
their the reception they'd received

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,140
would be the best so they wanted to

284
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,620
naturally recruit or penetrate and they

285
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,959
decided that the hungarians could do the

286
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:28,700
job

287
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,440
under the circumstances better than they

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,740
could developing countries May that

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,899
Islam ditman was a deputy director of

check intelligence at the time he fled

291
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,620
to the West

292
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,620
because there are many people who are

293
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,120
afraid to

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
get in touch to be associated with a

295
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,399
Soviet diploma for example who uses who

296
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,500
is an intelligence officer and uses the

297
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,160
Diplomatic power in most cases but they

298
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,139
they don't hesitate to develop a very

299
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,139
friendly contact with a Czech diploma or

300
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,940
a Polish diploma or an East German

301
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,339
diploma because they're saying what the

302
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,139
representatives of these small countries

303
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,079
can do and they don't realize that they

304
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,620
do basically the same job only under a

305
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,480
different color but

306
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,920
were you with the Soviet intelligence

307
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,519
say they know every everything that the

308
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,500

Soviet citizen Arcadia shivchenko often

317
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,980
stayed there while he was the under

322
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,200

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,680
Geographic Choice by the Soviets

332
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,440
I might point out that the estate while

333
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,800
it's located somewhat north of the

334
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,720
establishment is very close to Grumman

335
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,699
aircraft Factory which is one of the

sophisticated warplanes and it's sort of

338
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,740
midway between the main plan and a

339
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,779
testing facility that Bremen has further

340
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,699
out in the island and those antennae are

341
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,459
appointed toward both facilities

342
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,900

is a building in the Riverdale section

346
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,360
of the Bronx they got permission to

347
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,459
build on one of the highest sites in New

349
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,100
situated at an elevation that permits

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,620
not pleased with the location of their

355
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,120
Embassy

356
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,880
so they asked for and again were granted

357
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,339
permission to build on another site

358
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,199

get a good shot of Washington can we get

366
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,980
in

367
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,540

in Moscow the Americans had requested

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,699
permission to build a new Embassy to

383
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,620
replace their old and overcrowded

384
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,180
facilities there

385
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,300
in this instance comparisons are useful

386
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,579
the United States was eventually offered

387
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,160
and accepted a site on one of the lowest

388
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,500
points of land in the city and after

389
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,180
years of bureaucratic wrangling

390
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,699
permission was only recently granted to

391
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,360
begin Construction

392
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,620
thank you

393
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:15,660
[Music]

394
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,120
in the United States there is one place

395
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,699
that is more important for the KGB than

396
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,120
even the embassy or its consulates

397
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,000
how important is the United Nations to

398
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,120
the Soviets in terms of Espionage it's a

399
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,160
nest spies

400
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,160
the KGB operations in the UN are

401
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,840
controlled by the first Department of

402
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,880
the first Chief directorate at the KGB

403
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,460
this department directs all operations

404
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,000
against the United States and Canada

405
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,620
the officers of the department operate

406
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,299
from the embassies and consulates

407
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,580
operations are also run from the U.N

408
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,660
itself where over 500 Soviets work

409
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,179
the U.N was formed to provide a forum

410
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,160
for dialogue between the nations of the

411
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,740
world each country sends its ambassadors

412
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,900
and their staffs to the debates which

413
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,880
occur in the general assembly and

414
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,500
Security Council

415
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,960
awarded diplomatic status their

416
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,700
representatives live in the equivalent

417
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,340
of embassies in New York City and are

418
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,020
expected to represent their country's

419
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,820
interests

420
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,340
but in the Secretariat building are the

421
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,500
international civil servants without

422
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,320
diplomatic status they are expected to

423
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,600
be rigorously non-partisan in their

424
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,580
administration of the un's various

425
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,940
departments and worldwide programs

426
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,299
in 1978 one of the most important Soviet

427
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,000
defections to the West occurred Arcadia

428
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,980
shivchenko who was the under Secretary

429
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,260
General of the United Nations stunned

430
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,780
his Soviet colleagues as the highest

431
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,960
ranking Soviet in the U.N Secretariat

432
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,160
shevchenko had knowledge of extensive

433
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,140
Soviet Espionage activities in the

434
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,600
United States so serious was the

435
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,640
defection that two of the Soviet Union's

436
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,980
highest ranking ambassadors debrinian

437
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,440
and thrianofsky demanded a meeting with

438
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
shepchenko and his U.S lawyer this is

439
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,760
the first broadcast of a tape recorded

440
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,980
at that meeting Ambassador debrinian

441
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,080
reveals that shevchenko was privy to

442
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,240
Soviet state Secrets even though he was

443
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,460
supposedly an impartial U.N civil

444
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,760
servant documents

445
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
up till the last day when he left it

446
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,780
showed that there was no surveillance

447
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,260
he gave me copies of this letter

448
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,860
he refers to the what he went a betrayal

449
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,720
of the ideals of the October Revolution

450
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,240
which is taking place now in the USSR

451
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,820
the Monstrous abuse is carried on by the

452
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,520
KGB compelled me to take the decision to

453
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
renounce my membership and they see PSU

454
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,400
Etc necessary leads one to think that

455
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,039
his inner some abnormal State because a

456
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,520
normal person or a one acting at this

457
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,100
free will uh I don't think these

458
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,660
explanations there was no need for him

459
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,640
to stay in the Foreign Service for 30

460
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,760
years or 20 years and then finally find

461
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,500
out that it is agrees with the fruits of

462
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,120
a October Revolution

463
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,640
United Nations secretary to give so

464
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,620
gives so many advantages for the KGB to

465
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,620
penetrate actually almost all aspects of

466
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,400
the American life because they unlike

467
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,500
diplomats

468
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,340
go and Tarot across the country freely

469
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,200
they even should not

470
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,679
under no obligation to notify the state

471
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,840
department of American Mission about the

472
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
their travel trips for participation

473
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,000
anywhere probably the

474
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,340
most active intelligence gathering

475
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,320
functions are carried out by Soviets

476
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,299
assigned the United Nations I say that

477
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,760
for a number of reasons primarily that

478
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,940
U.N employees also have total freedom of

479
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,280
movement throughout the United States

480
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,740
it's a it's a goal in the mind for the

481
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,980
Soviet Union that it's so easy to have

482
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,400
such a huge number of the people

483
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,799
involved in intelligence activity my

484
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,660
estimate would be that the people who

485
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,299
are working for the Soviet intelligence

486
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,120
in general in New York about 300 or 350

487
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,860
persons in the world engage in all these

488
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,860
activities in theory the employees are

489
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,720
there to carry out the ideals and

490
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,340
humanitarian causes of the United

491
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,320
Nations and run the bureaucratic

492
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,480
Machinery but shevchenko quickly

493
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,100
discovered that even though he was one

494
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,720
of the United Nations highest ranking

495
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,159
bureaucrats and the head of his

496
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,179
Department the orders came from the KGB

497
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,260
I had in my department 13 Soviets

498
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,460
and the the at least seven of them were

499
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,760
professional

500
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,799
because they didn't do anything

501
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,260
they didn't work in in my department

502
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,860
they didn't receive orders from me as a

503
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,780
head of the department they received the

504
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,840
orders from from their bosses in the

505
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,580
mission from the kanjibouti area

506
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,419
residents

507
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,860
this man was one of those Soviets

508
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,140
working for shivchenko his name is

509
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,419
valdek enger he was placed in

510
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,460
chefchenko's Department not by the

511
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,159
normal U.N hiring practices but by the

512
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,159
KGB resident or senior officer in New

513
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
York City who requested shevchenko's

514
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,600
help in placing the spy in the United

515
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,679
Nations I agreed with that but I think

516
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,559
it was a mistake because it was a very

517
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,559
difficult to get rid of him later

518
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,460
because if he transformed my office into

519
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,240
a kind of a center or gathering of all

520
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,419
these KGB guys and collecting all these

521
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:47,400
materials and all this things and he

522
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,559
didn't do anything at all

523
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,559
whenever I asked him to to do something

524
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,840
uh

525
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,760
for for the department or for the

526
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,400
Secretariat or to write something for me

527
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,940
he was always reluctant of or absent or

528
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,179
have this bunch of his KGB guys in my

529
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,720
office I was and I was absolutely I was

530
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,360
mad about this situation

531
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,700
yeah

532
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,220
anger is asking a U.S naval Commander to

533
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,160
pass on secret documents

534
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,380

Soviet mission to the United Nations has

549
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,380

kazakov

551
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,059
within the U.N the Soviets are also able

552
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,460
to exert influence

553
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,000

international relations Institute in

562
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,100
Moscow was Igor glagalev who was an

563
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,020
advisor to the politburo before he

564
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,419

Soviet agent both Duggan and field were

600
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,059
brought into a Soviet Espionage ring by

601
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,640
the same recruiter a woman of amazing

602
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,159
persuasiveness I got the null field

603
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,860
and I got them Larry Duggan

604
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,580
and I got them all you know sort of

605
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,600
the socks small fry like Brine and you

606
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,659
know technical Personnel several women

607
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,299
that were mail drops and so on so forth

608
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,580
and it was always um for example with

609
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,279
women was mostly done with sex

610
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,140
I would always send somebody who was

611
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,020
handsome and and

612
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,539
they generally went to bed with whatever

613
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,140
it was and uh and at work during the

614
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,419
1930s Hayden massing was Soviet

615
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,279
espionage's most effective recruiting

616
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,380
agent in America this is her only

617
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,240
television interview filmed shortly

618
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,760
before her death in 1981.

619
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,700
during the 1920s she married into the

620
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,980
Communist Party in Europe falling in

621
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,440
love with its Intrigue and fellowship

622
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,380
her first husband was Gerhart Eisler a

623
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,940
top official of the Communist

624
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,340
International Espionage arm the common

625
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,700
turn

626
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,240
when you were 17 and you joined the

627
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,820
Communist party or became a member of

628
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,380
that Circle

629
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,500
but is it an emotional rather than a

630
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,919
political conversion only emotional not

631
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,620
political at all didn't understand a

632
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,600
thing about

633
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,880
that as I said I would have understood

634
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
this one sentence it is

635
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,039
a theory an ideology

636
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,140
which has as its aim a better life for

637
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,900
all that was good enough for me but the

638
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,200
life of all I'm amongst all

639
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,500
but that was as political as as it was

640
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,140
otherwise it was emotional I married

641
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,120
into the party

642
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,860
but for somebody who didn't understand

643
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,600
it you became one of their most

644
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,140
effective operators beta much much much

645
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,820
later

646
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,360
much later when I understood much more

647
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,559
and when I uh when really my

648
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,440
Effectiveness is so closely married

649
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,620
connected to Fascism I was effective

650
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,559
because there was Fascism and fascism

651
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,500
had to be thought it took me a long time

652
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,200
and I didn't want to realize it that

653
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,020
actually I was not fighting fascism it

654
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,559
was all baloney the Russians used me but

655
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,860
to admit that to yourself is of course

656
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,980
Very degrading

657
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,600
self-degrading you hesitate very much to

658
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,720
do that so for a long time I pretended

659
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,240
that I believe that this is the way to

660
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,840
fight Fascism and I acted it out okay

661
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,340
well let's go into some of the areas

662
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,260
where you were very successful you came

663
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,740
over to America in the early 1930s what

664
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,020
did you do and how did you get into that

665
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,640
Circle where you could operate

666
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,380
effectively well first of all when

667
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,080
that people in Moscow that many

668
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,200
Americans in Moscow I was functionary

669
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,659
for example I was called on by the

670
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,120
coming turn to entertain important

671
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,440
Americans

672
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,100
when they came to Moscow so I had had

673
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,460
connections personal connections the

674
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,020
connections were with those in the

675
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,539
American government so Hayden massing

676
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,399
closely controlled by the Russians

677
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,740
working in New York City and armed with

678
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,779
a sharp wit and a fierce determination

679
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,659
went on to recruit Lawrence Duggan one

680
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,279
of the senior members of the U.S state

681
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,140
Department

682
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,820
you know the

683
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,320
wonderful interesting isn't wasn't

684
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,399
difficult

685
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,460
I called him

686
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,220
because I unders you know he was a

687
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,620
friend of Noel field

688
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,279
um

689
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,039
and said that I wanted to see him and I

690
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,980
went into the state department into his

691
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,880
room and we made an appointment and I

692
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,539
approached him directly Howard Mary I

693
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,580
said you know I didn't tell you about

694
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,620
fascism you know it all you know it

695
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,140
better than I because you see all the

696
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,000
material I don't see

697
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,799
we want your help

698
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,140
will you help us

699
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,600
and he said yes

700
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,940
I have certain conditions

701
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,000
but yes I will help you now I will give

702
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,179
you all the material that I think might

703
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,960
be of interest to you and the Russians

704
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,200
into immediately who I was he was

705
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,020
Nobody's Fool

706
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,020
and only I will not give you the

707
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,720
material per se I will dictate it to

708
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,899
somebody and that somebody has to be

709
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:24,059
English speaking

710
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,880
and a very good shorthand

711
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,380
there it was I couldn't believe it

712
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,140
while recruiting noo field Ada messing

713
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,899
uncovered another Soviet spy ring in

714
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,080
Washington of which she had been unaware

715
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,340
I had worked on no field for a long time

716
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,700
I had listened to Wagner which I hate I

717
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,220
had read fraud which I dislike and

718
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
discussed fine points of Freud with him

719
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,899
you know really lying in my teeth and

720
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,659
um because I wanted I wanted him I

721
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,600
wanted to wanted to do a good job and I

722
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,840
had I also liked the family I liked her

723
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,299
better than him he was a little bit

724
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,520
although he was rather good looking you

725
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,399
know very tall and very sort of

726
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,880
gentleman like to me was a little bit

727
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,320
unappetizing I really could it must have

728
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,559
been a body smell uh I don't know what

729
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,440
it was but anyhow I liked her better she

730
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,679
was also more honest she was she was a

731
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,460
little dumb and one day

732
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,960
I said you don't know it's about time

733
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,240
that you you have more or less agreed

734
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,659
that you will work with me now I think

735
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:43,440
we

736
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,120
ought to start and he said

737
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,620
you know Heda

738
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,200
I wanted to tell you this and I

739
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,179
hesitated because I know it will upset

740
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,260
you but

741
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,200
I have decided that I will not work with

742
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,720
you but I would rather work with

743
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,840
somebody who does exactly the same thing

744
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,220
you do

745
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,399
who is however with me in the same

746
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,320
department and it would be so much

747
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,200
easier technically to convey whatever I

748
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,940
have to give to this person and I said

749
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,880
who is this person of course terrified

750
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,500
he was my investment of a one-year

751
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,720
studying Wagner and fruit for that

752
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,299
anyhow I said

753
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:36,240
um who is this man and he said I don't

754
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,820
think you know him his name is Al jahez

755
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,220
he was an advisor to President Roosevelt

756
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,519
at The crucial Yalta Conference and was

757
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,740
the man who flew to Washington with the

758
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,840
historic Charter documents of the United

759
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,299
Nations organizing conference in San

760
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,279
Francisco where he had served as

761
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,399
temporary Secretary General

762
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,279
Alger Hiss was a rising star in the

763
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,200
state department and director of The

764
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,600
Office of special political Affairs he

765
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
was never far from Center Stage

766
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
after allegations were made of his

767
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,679
communist activities he appeared before

768
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,300
the house on American Activities

769
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,460
Committee I am not

770
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,780
never have

771
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,700
a member of the

772
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,460
throughout two famous trials and a

773
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,379
conviction for perjury he has

774
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,720
steadfastly proclaimed his innocence and

775
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,639
today there is a strong Lobby in the

776
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,679
United States to overturn his

777
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,919
convictions Mr Chambers charged except

778
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,020
that I knew him briefly were you ever

779
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,760
come no

780
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,899
this man's memory is rather different

781
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,179
Nathaniel Weil was a member of the same

782
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,760
Communist Party cell as Alger his I want

783
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,399
to ask you if you ever met Elder hiss oh

784
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,980
yes about 30 times or so 30 40. under

785
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,500
what circumstances well I'm speaking

786
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,800
about uh see the cell met every week

787
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,400
and uh attendance was a very

788
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,040
duty to be taken very seriously

789
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,200
you had to have an extremely good excuse

790
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,300
for not being there

791
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,720
so that if one assumes that um

792
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,140
that I was in this unit for nine months

793
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,940
and that there was a meeting every week

794
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,460
it works out to about 30 or 40 times but

795
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,740
Hayden massing trying to recruit Noel

796
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,200
field had no idea that algerhis was also

797
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,000
working for the Soviets each of the

798
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,040
Communist cells were small and carefully

799
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,740
separated in this case both Alger Hiss

800
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,480
and Hayden messing were trying to

801
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,280
recruit the same man

802
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,660
I met algeris because Noah called me a

803
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,640
week after I'd been there in New York

804
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,880
and said can you come to Washington I

805
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,160
have dinner a dinner date for you and

806
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,160
after his at my house and I said of

807
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,560
course I'll come and I came

808
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,900
and I met him

809
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,440
and the beginning was that he said so

810
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,540
you are the girl that is trying to take

811
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,099
Noel away from me and I said uh well you

812
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,500
are the man who was trying to take Noel

813
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,099
away from me and

814
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,200
then I said I suppose I don't know the

815
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,040
exact words uh don't forget after all

816
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm female and I'm a fighter and I won't

817
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,640
let that happen so easily

818
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,020
uh and he grinned and then we had all

819
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,599
sorts of conversations we stood alone he

820
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,760
and I at the window and spoke and the

821
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,339
farewell was that I said or he said and

822
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:42,900
I don't remember

823
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,240
who said what but he I think he said

824
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,339
whoever gets Noah after all we are

825
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:53,180
working for the same boss

826
00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:04,260
[Music]

827
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,780
more than 90 percent

828
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,119
communist agents

829
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,820
are blackmail these people are not

830
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,160
ideological supporters

831
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
but they are brutally blackmail was this

832
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,420
what you look for when you were in the

833
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,579
check intelligence yeah the ability to

834
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,380
Blackmail people that's right that's

835
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,880
right yeah the fact that you were

836
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,460
forcibly trapped

837
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,780
and we know the way that you were

838
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,280
trapped it was a homosexual entrapment

839
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,900
that you were entrapped in which the

840
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,720
checks got you this is correct right

841
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,880
this man was blackmailed while on

842
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,579
Embassy Duty in Prague Czechoslovakia as

843
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,380
an Air Force Cipher clerk he was in a

844
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,540
position to seriously compromise NATO

845
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,119
Readiness secrets

846
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,099
it was a stupid thing to do and I did it

847
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,619
I got caught doing it by somebody that

848
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,619
shouldn't have or shouldn't have

849
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,480
I've gone through this rigging world for

850
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,320
over a year after we left the front

851
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,700
I haven't heard from anybody since that

852
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,280
time most Americans have a very naive

853
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,859
politically very nice

854
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:07,680
and so I think it's in many cases very

855
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,480
easy for

856
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,880
for communist intelligence offices

857
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,940
to get in touch with important Americans

858
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,320
to

859
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,380
seduce them in one way or another and

860
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,200
likely to complete mail them

861
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,660
I was not contacted in Texas were back

862
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,920
here until about a month or two before

863
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,619
he ever left the country

864
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,599
when you say contact if you're contacted

865
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,579
by the text by the Czech intelligence

866
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,900
service well I don't know who they were

867
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,780
I was saying that was contacted yeah but

868
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,400
I assumed that they had what do you mean

869
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,619
when you say contacted how what form did

870
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,480
that contact take we just did a meeting

871
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
on the street

872
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,900
of a man just walked up to

873
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,540
and what did this man say well he

874
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,160
indicated that they had had photographs

875
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,320
of me and you know that he was

876
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,060
contacting it it's on future today

877
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,280
well can you tell me what did the check

878
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,900
intelligence service

879
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,140
ask you for or want you to do there's no

880
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,859
discussion at all

881
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,260
it was just the fact that he confronted

882
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,520
me with the fact that they had pictures

883
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,140
and photographs of me doing this

884
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,820
homosexual act with the other

885
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,380
individuals that was the whole

886
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,060
experiment there was nothing asked for

887
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,740
or given

888
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,480
when you said a fellow that was involved

889
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,400
in the situation

890
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,420
in the photographs yeah he he was he was

891
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,320
the other man with whom you were having

892
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,060
this affair with right

893
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,280
and he defected and as a result that was

894
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,180
how they found out about you

895
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,119
and you were never asked for secret

896
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,780
documents

897
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,740
there was just a man that came up to you

898
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,540
in the street in Prague and said that we

899
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,980
have photographs of you and we're gonna

900
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,370
ask you for something at a later date

901

[Music]

902
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,900
or whatever what kind of information

903
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,790
could you have theoretically given them

904
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:12,900
[Music]

905
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,260
in Moscow the KGB targets not only low

906
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,359
ranking officials sometimes their

907
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,359
blackmail extends right to the top John

908
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,400
Watkins was the Canadian ambassador to

909
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,800
the Soviet Union in the late 50s when he

910
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,780
was targeted for recruitment

911
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,619
two KGB defectors nasenko and goliczin

912
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,320
have revealed that Watkins was under KGB

913
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,780
control but the story has never before

914
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,780
received official confirmation William

00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,800
homosexual he knew that they knew he was

918
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,240
a homosexual

919
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,740
were you saying that he was being

920
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,500
blackmailed by him

921
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,440
uh in in a kind of a way yes that he

922
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,900
knew that they could embarrass him if he

923
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,760
didn't cooperate

924
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,280
while in the Soviet Union Lester B

Khrushchev at his Dhaka on the Crimean

928
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,240
sea the meetings were arranged by the

929
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,700
Soviets to increase Watkins prestige in

930
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,859
Pearson's eyes and to speed his

931
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,140
promotion to positions with access to

932
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,920
sensitive information

933
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,079
when you find that a man like Watkins an

934
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,000
ambassador was a homosexual

935
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,040
and you knew the pressure that was being

936
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,940
placed on homosexuals in uh Russia at

937
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,020
that time

938
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,420
uh he was an obvious Target for 4K GB

939
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,060
and he was surrounded by the KGB

940
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,900
Watkins handler was Anatoly gorsky Alias

941
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,359

Soviet agents philby McLean Burgess and

943
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,460
blunt in Britain

944
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,339
soon after Pearson's visit Watkins was

945
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,380
transferred back to Ottawa as assistant

946
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,680
under Secretary of external Affairs

947
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,240
external Affairs chairs the committee

948
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,920
that controls all of Canadian

949
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,560
intelligence matters he died of a heart

950
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,980
attack on October 10 1964 in Montreal

951
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,700
after being interrogated by the RCMP for

952
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,339
over 10 years Tom Fox was head of U.S

953
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,320
military counterintelligence in charge

954
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,599
of breaking major Soviet operations in

955
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,300
America and Europe well the Soviets are

956
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,560
like any good headhunting business

957
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,820
organization that's looking for good

958
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,140
talent

959
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,020
the Soviets will establish a

960
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,579
relationship with the individuals

961
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:46,140
determine the individual's needs desires

962
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,540
strengths and weaknesses and try to

963
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,040
exploit that

964
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,560
David Barnett was a former employee with

965
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,599
the CIA whose business was facing

966
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,880
bankruptcy his solution was to approach

967
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,760
the KGB in exchange for money he

968
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,339
compromised several CIA operations and

969
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,859
the lives of the agents involved he was

970
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:06,660
instructed by the Soviets to obtain

971
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,579
positions with several Congressional

972
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,619
intelligence committees in order to pass

973
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,200
on inside information for his Services

974
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,319
he received 92 thousand dollars

975
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,540
but the Soviets used settler methods for

976
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,760
recruiting at the time when he was a

977
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,740
congressional assistant with access to

978
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,619
U.S naval Readiness Secrets Jim cappus

979
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,240
was approached by a Soviet official

980
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,220
offering him the opportunity to write

981
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,020
articles for a leading Soviet press

982
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,140
agency and I as a staff member had

983
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,900
access to most of the classified

984
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,880
materials that might have been presented

985
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,880
to the committee from time to time

986
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,300
how were the approaches first made

987
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,280
initially it was strictly social uh

988
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,780
later of course the meetings were

989
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,640
arranged they were arranged for just the

990
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,400
two of us they were arranged at

991
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,920
primarily at bars what exactly did he

992
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,319
suggest you should do in the beginning

993
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,020
he suggested that I write articles for

994
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,300
him theoretically to be translated and

995
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,339
published in the novosti Press which is

996
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:08,220
a Soviet to press service

997
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,680
course later it became more obvious the

998
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,780
type of stories that he was seeking were

999
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,000
those that were based on classified

1000
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,859
information or information that was not

1001
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,540
generally known to the public in

1002
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,119
attempting to recruit agents the KGB

1003
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,160
also uses the services of the

1004
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,660
International Information Department

1005
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,079
which controls tasks Pravda is Bestia

1006
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,590
and the novice depress agency

1007
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,540
[Music]

1008
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,280
a man who is familiar with the

1009
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
procedures of recruitment is Yuri

1010
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,660
bisminov who served with novelty in

1011
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,400
India before defecting to the West

1012
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,339
because during my 12 years with novasti

1013
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:45,359
I

1014
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,300
I it was quite clear to me that about 70

1015
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,780
to 80 it's hard to count percent of the

1016
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,780
novelty employees are at the same time

1017
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,380
either full-time officers of the KGB or

1018
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,980
part-time Cult agents like myself when I

1019
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,839
was working for the novice team for

1020
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,240
Soviets like Yuri bisminov or Carlo

1021
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,940
tuomi an illegal sent to America to

1022
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,040
recruit agents the methods of

1023
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,339
recruitment are deceptively easy

1024
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:17,119
recruit somebody

1025
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,540
you recruit them by

1026
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,740
establishing a friendship but you don't

1027
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,339
you don't recruit them as a as a Soviet

1028
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:29,579
spy you're supposedly working for some

1029
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,859
Corporation

1030
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,319
which is interested in a trade secrets

1031
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,579
of a competing Corporation or maybe

1032
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:40,920
you're asking information on behalf of a

1033
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,359
friend who's writing a technical book

1034
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,680
so is this what you were told in Moscow

1035
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,940
that you should not say that you're

1036
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,619
working for the Soviets that you should

1037
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:52,740
work for a company or right right you

1038
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,200
come out you come out as a Soviet

1039
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,480
intelligence agent only when you recruit

1040
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,640
the person on ideological basis

1041
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,680
in the 1930s no one was more successful

1042
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,780
in recruiting Young Americans than hater

1043
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,819
messing she recruited at the highest

1044
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,560
levels of government and discovered that

1045
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,420
the ideological approach worked best

1046
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,700
with the privileged in America it would

1047
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,339
have been almost impossible to recruit A

1048
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,440
working class

1049
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,980
almost impossible of America yeah

1050
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,040
but it would be easy to recruit the

1051
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,500
intellectual and middle class

1052
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,540
but what does a Communist Party have to

1053
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,460
offer the elite

1054
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,740
great ideas

1055
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,579
the freedom of all time

1056
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:39,119
Marxism

1057
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,300
a different economical system

1058
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,800
thoughts

1059
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,119
new medical experiments knew the world

1060
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,920
the world

1061
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,760
you see the Soviet Union has never

1062
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,380
changed its goal never

1063
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,680
you know it's it's called as a phrase it

1064
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,380
still wants to dominate the world

1065
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,200
you know that it has never changed that

1066
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,830
[Music]

1067
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,340
[Music]

1068
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,099
in the late 1950s when Fidel Castro was

1069
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,720
taking his Revolution out of the

1070
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,060
mountains toward the ultimate victory Of

1071
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,339
Havana the world watched what was

1072
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,920
believed to be a popular uprising of the

1073
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,859
people that is not communism

1074
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,819
or Marxism in our idea

1075
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:42,800
our political philosophic is

1076
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,140
representative democracy and social

1077
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,040
justice in a well-planned economy

1078
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,920
but the revolution provided a new base

1079
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,079
for the KGB and the Communist

1080
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:57,000
intelligence Networks

1081
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,700
larislav bittmann was a deputy director

1082
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,040
with Czech intelligence a few years

1083
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,319
after the revolution the checks helped

1084
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,900
to build up the into the Cuban

1085
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,420
intelligence service and then I think in

1086
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,720
the early 1960s the Soviets took over

1087
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,780
completely when Cuba was really in the

1088
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,680
hands of the Soviet Soviet Union

1089
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,579
yeah

1090
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:22,740
at the Cuban mission to the United

1091
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,980
Nations in New York City where 98 Cuban

1092
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,980
Nationals work at least half are members

1093
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,380
of the DGI the Cuban intelligence

1094
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,420
service

1095
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,720
this man is Nestor Garcia until the

1096
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,240
summer of 1980 he was officially listed

1097
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,280
as the first Secretary to the Cuban

1098
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,119
mission

1099
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,460
but in reality he was chief of station

1100
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,560
for Cuban intelligence in New York City

1101
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,660
in Moscow the direct responsibility for

1102
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,119
running Cuban intelligence is assigned

1103
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,240
to Department 11 of the KGB the same

1104
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,220
Department that controls the checks

1105
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,859
polls and other European communist

1106
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,040
intelligence agencies

1107
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,640
since the late 1960s Soviet KGB officers

1108
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,400
living in Havana have directly run the

1109
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,400
operation of Cuban intelligence

1110
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,920
as a result of two years research the

1111
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,359
connections team has been able to

1112
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:21,119
ascertain these startling facts

1113
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,640
Cuban intelligence was taken over by the

1114
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,099
Soviets in 1969.

1115
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:29,040
at that time it became and has remained

1116
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,500
totally financed and controlled by the

1117
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,640
KGB

1118
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,640
now living in hiding this man is the

1119
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,099
highest ranking Cuban officer to defect

1120
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:39,780
to the United States

1121
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,819
this is the first known television

1122
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:44,839
interview that a DGI officer has given

1123
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:48,140
Moscow I was trained in

1124
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,400
recruiting of Agents

1125
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,680
in infiltrating uh the CIA

1126
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,599
encounter intelligence was all your

1127

1193
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,000
were ripe revolutionaries of the left

first meeting dealt with what the group

1202
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,660
would do in Cuba secondly was what we

1203
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,760
could do in the United States once we

1204
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,059
returned and third of all uh we received

uh over twenty thousand dollars to bring

00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,760

well when when the Cubans viewed the the

00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,059
Revolutionary struggle in the United

1260
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:30,059

00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:33,119
that the left as it existed in 69 and 70

1262

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,000
get in touch with Bernadine Delgado

1280

1284
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,260
and put me back in contact with the how

1285
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,440

00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:45,180
Brigade contingent arrived in Cuba all

1312
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:50,220
the operational of the vgi had to drop

1313
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,619
what they were doing and go to work on

1314
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:56,040
adventure Brigade we had to investigate

1315
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,119
collect background to see who could be

1316
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:03,480
recruited what information could be

1317
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,440
obtained do you know of Young Americans

1318
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,240
who were recruited

1319
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,119
in the Brigade to work for the Cuban

1320
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,920
intelligence who came back to America

1321
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,260
and were secretly working for the Cubans

1322
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:21,540
yes and they are still working still

1323
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,380
working for the Cubans in America

1324
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,059
yes definitely the Brigade was

1325
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:28,980
established with the sole purpose of

1326
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,260
providing a cover for the weatherman to

1327
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:34,200
get their people to Cuba for training

1328
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,440
and that that's why it existed as a

1329
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,599
matter of fact when our people came back

1330
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,299
off the first then ceramus Brigade and I

1331
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:46,260
think it was February of 1970. the

1332
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,260
criticism that the Cubans had made about

1333
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,000
the Valencia Ramos Brigade indicated

1334
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,980
that the majority of people being sent

1335
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,200
there they felt were useless they really

1336
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,599
weren't helping them Harvest sugar cane

1337
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,660
but that it was justified in the sense

1338
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,660
that here was a means to train and

1339
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,940
politicize weatherman context and

1340
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,359
whether Cuba somehow had the ability to

1341
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,000
uh bring out young people at that time

1342
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,240
uh the feeling of of Communism with a

1343
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,319
mambo beat or uh somehow that uh what

1344
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:20,700
was happening in Cuba was totally

1345
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,140
different than what was happening

1346
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,799
anyplace else in the world

1347
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,140
this was the main reason of the

1348
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:30,720
interview showed by the Russians in

1349
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,660
trying to control the DGI because the

1350
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,240
Cubans could work far more easily than

1351
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,359
the Soviets weren't the weather people

1352
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,940
aware that they were being used by the

1353
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:44,339
Soviets and something no they

1354
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:46,619
they view the Cubans as being the

1355
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:49,200
Vanguard of the international Communist

1356
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,460
Revolution

1357
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,680
now the Vanguard essentially means that

1358
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,660
the Cubans are at the very tip of the

1359
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,720
spear they're the leadership

1360
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,559
um

1361
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,900
the Russians are being used by the

1362
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,900
Cubans now this is the weatherman's

1363
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,059
rationalization of this this interaction

1364
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:08,819
between the Soviets and the Cubans the

1365
01:01:08,819 --> 01:01:10,619
Cubans said you've got to become active

1366
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:12,960
you've got to start doing things and

1367
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,660
planning a national action to protest

1368
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,660
the beginning of the Chicago 8 trial and

1369
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,480
to commemorate the the riots during the

1370
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,020
Democratic National Convention of 68

1371
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:28,500
uh and to protest the war in Vietnam is

1372
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,440
not action action requires that you

1373
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,140
confront the system violently

1374
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,059
so when the weatherman got back from

1375
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,460
Cuba they changed the National Action to

1376
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,860

international terrorist ring

it was the late March or early April of

01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,299

Canada where at in Canada I don't know

1405
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,900
to meet with members of the Quebec

1406
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,599
Liberation Front with the objective of

1407
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:03,180
establishing closer ties with them

or three thousand dollars from the

1412
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,799
Quebec Liberation Front that had been

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:17,579
sent

1414
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,460
from Cuba for the weatherman it was an

1415
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,760
attempt in 1965.

1416
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,480
buy a group of blacks who had gone to

Statue of Liberty

1419
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,020
the Black Liberation Front which had

1420
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,319
been formed in Cuba in 1964 was the

1421
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:40,260
prime mover behind this plot the bombing

1422
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,000
was prevented however when the police

1423
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,920
recovered the explosives from their

1424
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,960
hiding place in the Bronx

1425
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,260

1426
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,819
a member of the French Canadian

1427
01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:53,280

illegally transporting Dynamite

1431
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:04,920
we know that uh the weatherman

1432
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,160
underground organization uh went to Cuba

1433
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,200
and utilized the same kinds of

1434
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,200
techniques that we utilized these people

1435
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,220
uh did engage in in direct bombing and

1436
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,980
killing uh in the United States so I

1437
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,780
fear and yet most of them haven't been

1438
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,520
heard from for a long long time that's

1439
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,660
right but they're still out there

1440
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,079
they're underground and the question is

1441
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:30,299
uh over a long period of time what does

1442
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:33,500

near Ireland

1563
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,780

Soviet Espionage efforts in North

1570
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,280
America are designed to assist the

capabilities of their submarines in the

Atlantic and Caribbean

1573
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,100
some of these efforts have seemed

1574
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,080
trivial yet the results are still

01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,260
affecting Canadian and American Security

1576
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,659

by the KGB

1578
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,260
he was at first offered small payments

1579
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,780
for unclassified information but the

1580
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,120
promise of larger sums soon led to his

1581
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,980
acquiring more sensitive strategic

1582
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,800
documents such as classified Naval maps

1583
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,780
of old wrecks that lay on the bottom of

1584
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,280
the Atlantic along the Canadian

01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,640
well now these Maps were of extreme

1590
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,900
importance

1591
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,000
to the Russians

1592
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,980

1594
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,420

surface

1597
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,159
the submarine would know it and to avoid

1598
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:37,080
detection that's all the submarine had

1599
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,300
to do was settle down alongside of a

1600
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,120
wreck so that when the patrol boat above

1601
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,880
would make contact with some sounding

01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,940
with the bottom of the ocean with some

1604
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:50,280
metal down there he'd look on a map and

1605
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,040
he'd say oh yes this is just a wreck and

1606
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,159
he'd move on leaving the submarine to

1607
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,850
continuous Patrol safely

1682
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,440
Colonel Herman as a long time trusted

1683
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,199
Source Professor Hamilton met Herman

1684
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:42,000
many times and supplied him with

1685
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,110
information

1686

1687
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,560
this interview was filmed with hidden

1688
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,550
cameras

1689
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:51,779
[Music]

1690
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,060
on your faces

1691
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,420
Herman met Hamilton at least a dozen

1692
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:10,080
times in Canada and in 1975 they met in

1693
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,659
Haiti where Hamilton passed Hermann

1694
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:15,840
information about the Chinese Embassy

1695
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,640
come there to see you there was a top

1696
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,360
secret FBI RCMP operation targeting

1697
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,020
Professor Hamilton and Colonel Hermann

1698
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:26,600
codenamed red pepper

1699
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,739
what was the reason for the meetings

1700
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:30,780
between Herman and Hamilton

1701
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,820
again you're getting into what is still

1702
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,460
a sensitive area I can say this that

1703
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,480
Colonel Herman was ordered to contact

1704
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:42,360
Hamilton by his own admission by his

1705
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,820
superiors of Moscow but beyond that I

1706
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,300
would not like to go

1707
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,100
Professor Hamilton is not as naive as he

1708
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,360
might appear

1709
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,760
during World War II he worked for free

1710
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,860
French intelligence

1711
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:57,600
to the war he worked for Canadian

1712
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,580
intelligence in Germany

1713
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:02,580
but then in the late 1940s he met in

1714
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:05,219
Ottawa with Vladimir Borodin a senior

1715
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:08,840
recruiter for Soviet intelligence

1716
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,080
did you not

1717
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,409
[Music]

1718
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,020
I guess

1719
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:27,179
from 1956 to 1961 Hamilton had top

1720
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:29,520
secret security clearance when he worked

1721
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,900
for nato in Paris

1722
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,580
Professor Hamilton has also made two

1723
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,040
trips to Cuba

1724
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,380
he met with a leading Cuban intelligence

1725
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,260
officer Ricardo escartine who has

1726
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,000
recently been expelled from the United

1727
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,960
States for Espionage activities

1728
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,100
in 1975 he made a trip to Moscow

1729
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,420
how come you went to the Soviet Union

1730
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,910
at all

1731
01:18:57,910 --> 01:18:59,480
[Music]

1732
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,640
later he confessed to making a 10 to 12

1733
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,699
day trip to the Soviet Union in 1975

1734
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,219
where in his own words he was under

1735
01:19:08,219 --> 01:19:11,120
considerable pressure from the KGB

1736
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,820
subsequently the RCMP raided hambleton's

1737
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,679
Ottawa residence and seized the

1738
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:19,260
shortwave radio and code books

1739
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,480
Professor Hambleton was just one of

1740
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,000
Colonel hermann's contacts Herman has

1741
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,520
provided the FBI with significant leads

1742
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,800
on Soviet agents operating in North

1743
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,860
America his Espionage activities were of

1744
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:34,140
the utmost importance

1745
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:38,159
my job would be without any importance

1746
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,920
I would definitely really not spend such

1747
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,380
a long time in United States

1748
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,480
and besides uh you know during my years

1749
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,320
of service I was several times promoted

1750
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,840
now Colonel Hermann is somewhere in

1751
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,179
hiding in the United States an illegal

1752
01:19:57,179 --> 01:20:00,380
who came to the surface

1753
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,420
Carlo tuomi is another example of an

1754
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:06,480
illegal sent to America by Moscow

1755
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,060
you were known as an illegal what

1756
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,260
exactly is an illegal illegal is a

1757
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,159
foreign agent who

1758
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:19,800
enters the country with

1759
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,199
voice documents

1760
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:24,860
and

1761
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:29,460
establishes himself as a citizen of that

1762
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:32,340
Country and

1763
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,320
bill by Lil acquires all the

1764
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,219
documentation and driver's license

1765
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:41,340
birth certificates credit cards and so

1766
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,300
and so on finds a job

1767
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:47,280
gets all the credentials and on the

1768
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,699
background

1769
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:52,440
future references

1770
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,840
as a

1771
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,219
Bonafide citizen of that country

1772
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:57,659
question in this case that's what

1773
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:59,940
happened to you right that's right and

1774
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,380
you got all this from Moscow when you

1775
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,420
were trained as a spy at a spy school in

1776
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,280
Moscow that's right that's right that

1777
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,060
was a major part of my schooling

1778
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,880
in case of North America Canada and the

1779
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,440
United States what is much more

1780
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,420
dangerous are these so-called illicus

1781
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,520
who are smuggled into these countries

1782
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,620
that is people who are

1783
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:23,460
who come here under a new identity

1784
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,300
and they they live as citizens of these

1785
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,000
countries and they would start

1786
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,580
operating really in in case of war

1787
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,840
between

1788
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,699
the Soviet Union and the United States

1789
01:21:35,699 --> 01:21:39,420
for example or in in the time of major

1790
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:42,840
of a very serious crisis when for

1791
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,400
example the diplomatic relations would

1792
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,719
be broken in case of War

1793
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,440
I would I would be

1794
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,460
among other illegals the only

1795
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,600
means by which the Soviet Union could

1796
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,420
get any Military

1797
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,340
Intelligence from the from the United

1798
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:08,040
States because all their diplomatic

1799
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,260
means all the open means

1800
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,179
would wake her up

1801
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,040
and at the time you were with Czech

1802
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,840
intelligence and there were actually

1803
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,840
agents sent over here yes who were to

1804
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,140
just sit and wait that's right yeah

1805
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,260
and very many

1806
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:27,300
the Soviets used many roots to secretly

1807
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,060
Place their illegals the Soviet fishing

1808
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,860
fleets which regularly stop at North

1809
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,960
American ports have often provided the

1810
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,780
KGB with a secure means of Landing their

1811
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,960
spies Boris stern was a photojournalist

1812
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,940
with the Soviet fishing fleet and

1813
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:45,440
recalls an incident he once witnessed

1814
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,840
one time we left a man in St John's

1815
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:50,100
Newfoundland

1816
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,040
he had been kept in hiding on my boat

1817
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,380
I thought and the other people on our

1818
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,900
boat thought he was an illegal being

1819
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,300
dropped into Canada you believe that

1820
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,540
this was a case of dropping a spy off in

1821
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,980
Canada

1822
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,260
yes

1823
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,940
within the KGB there is another

1824
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,159
department which controls illegals

1825
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:13,679
Department V conducts what are known

1826
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,719

Dirty Work of the KGB

respectable if someone if you look at

1847
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,980

North America to engage in Espionage

1863
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,360
acts and you decided for one reason or

1864
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,480
another not to go through with this

1865
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,659
uh was sent to Edmonton in western

1866
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:06,060
Canada where he spent four years working

1867
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,219
and acquiring all the credentials of a

1868
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:11,699
normal Canadian citizen in 1965 the call

1869
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:14,159
came from Moscow He was ordered to go to

1870
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:16,440
a Toronto suburb and observe a house and

1871
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,840
its occupants the house was at the time

1872
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,580
inhabited by one of the most famous

1873
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,880
defectors of all Igor guzenko who fled

1874
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,120
the Soviet Embassy in 1945. his

1875
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,040
defection led to the uncovering of

1876
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,380
Soviet spy rings in North America and

1877
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,239
was a severe setback for Soviet

1878
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:36,179
Espionage twenty years after it occurred

1879
01:25:36,179 --> 01:25:39,060
Department V of the KGB was still

1880
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,090
sending its agents looking for him

1883
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,239
if I open door you see that I never

1884
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,500
opened doors

1885
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,080
never opened or in my house it possibly

1886
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,010
went to the wrong house

could they might come in a long house or

1890
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,920
something but I never myself open the

1893
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:08,639
activated by KGB agent Oleg komenko who

1894
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,500
at the time was working as a counselor

1895
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,719
at the Soviet Embassy in Ottawa and was

1896
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,000
traveling with the Russian mosaev ballet

strategically placed in western Canada

1899

secret cold weather testing for Canadian

1905
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,880
and American forces and sabotka was

1906
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,980
ordered to find all he could about these

1907
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,179
facilities

1908
01:26:39,179 --> 01:26:41,580
he had other important missions one of

1909
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,080
which was to act as a link between

1910
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,260
Moscow and a KGB sabotage Network in

1911
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:48,719
North America was no accident that you

1912
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:49,920
were sent out to Edmonton with oil

1913
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,980
refineries and all that surfing

1914
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,130
it it was not an accident in your Center

1916
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,520
and I would presume that they they had

1917
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,639
their plans on that I must really go

legitimate business there however most

1925
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,739
military attaches in reality are spies

during World War II Carlo tuomi was

1936
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,219
recruited into the Soviet military

1937
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:10,920
intelligence he was born in Michigan a

1938
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,840
Finnish parents who left America and

1939
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,460
went to the Soviet Union while he was

1940
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,800
still a boy his Boyhood knowledge of

1941
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,840
America made him a natural candidate to

1942
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,239
become a Soviet spy sent back to the U.S

1943
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,980
as an illegal

1944
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:27,860
I was trained to collect

1945
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,080
military information

1946
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,620
about the United States armed forces

1947
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:37,139
with special emphasis

1948
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:38,000
um

1949
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,060
Naval Affairs and shipments of arms

1950
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:47,719
locations of

1951
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:50,699
docks and warehouses specifically in the

1952
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:54,380
Harvard New York where these arms were

1953
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:58,560
being stored and handled and from where

1954
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,780
they've been shipped to foreign

1955
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:03,540
countries in other words you were a spy

1956
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,179
that's true

1957
01:29:06,179 --> 01:29:07,980
I studied

1958
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:10,139
the

1959
01:29:10,139 --> 01:29:14,420
United States in general the geography

1960
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:19,199
economy government armed forces the

1961
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,780
woman who was

1962
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,420
my English instructor

1963
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,980
I've been born

1964
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:28,560
in Brooklyn it was a graduate of

1965
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,679
Columbia University I had a excellent

1966
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,480
command of a modern American English

1967
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,480
what about uh the American culture I

1968
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,040
mean how were you trained so that you

1969
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,380
would feel at home in America once you

1970
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:46,340
got there from Moscow

1971
01:29:47,159 --> 01:29:49,699
well

1972
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,580
that basic way of

1973
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,580
getting me into touch with American

1974
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,460
reality and culturally by showing

1975
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,699
American movies or movies you can learn

1976
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:06,659
quite a bit of people behave how they

1977
01:30:06,659 --> 01:30:10,380
dress how they talk and so that's a very

1978
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:13,679
important way to train an agent who is

1979
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,159
to operate in that particular country

1980
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,620
one of my one of the agents he was not

1981
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,440
an instructor but he was a more

1982
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,380
administrative

1983
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:28,080
Personnel he took me to uh Storehouse

1984
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,820
which looked like a

1985
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,480
really like the American

1986
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,420
clothing store

1987
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,639
where they picked the clothing the right

1988
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,659
size well the suits and Overcoat had to

1989
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:45,840
be had to be adjusted

1990
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,699
were these American clothes that were

1991
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:49,380
shipping over the Soviet Union they were

1992
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,620
American clothes uh a lot of them were

1993
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,100
foundations

1994
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,980
I entered the United States by train I

1995
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,679
took a train from

1996
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,480
Montreal

1997
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,340
to Chicago

1998
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:09,060
so Canada was used as a as a stepping

1999
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,320
ground

2000
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:12,600
to enter the United States because

2001
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,679
Canada

2002
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,020
a usual way that the Soviets put spies

2003
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,860
in the United States it is uh

2004
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:23,820
it is considered the easiest way

2005
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,699
Soviet agents in the U.S went to Great

2006
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:28,440
Lengths to create what is called his

2007
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:32,460
legend or his cover story this Legend

2008
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,920
uh for the later years where I was

2009
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,980
employed especially in New York and New

2010
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,219
York and then in Milwaukee

2011
01:31:40,219 --> 01:31:43,400
the Soviet

2012
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,120
diplomatic

2013
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,639
intelligence agents had done a lot of

2014
01:31:47,639 --> 01:31:49,920
groundwork they had studied these

2015
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,560
different places

2016
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,000
they they took

2017
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,699
picture from the outside they had even

2018
01:31:56,699 --> 01:31:59,400
some pictures taken inside of these

2019
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:01,080
these places

2020
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,480
in Moscow to only were shown these

2021
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,219
photographs of a lumber company in the

2022
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:06,480

2023
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,639
worked and of a General Electric Plant

2024
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,320
where he was also supposed to have been

2025
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,639
employed

2026
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:14,219
they have been taken by

2027
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:15,659
uh

2028
01:32:15,659 --> 01:32:17,659
Soviet

2029
01:32:17,659 --> 01:32:21,000

2030
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,760
working for the U.N

2031
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,699

2032
01:32:26,699 --> 01:32:29,639
sent in corporate form to Target

2033
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:33,000
intelligence agents who were posing as a

2034
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,040
U.N diplomats

2035
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,139
and they were

2036
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:39,139
processed

2037
01:32:39,139 --> 01:32:40,660
by these

2038
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,920
[Music]

2039
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:47,340

by letter with a New York postmark did

2042
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:54,179
you ever get money from Soviet officials

2043
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:57,360
working with or for the U.N definitely

2044
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,340
they they left the drops

[Music]

2046
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,840
magnetic containers like this I usually

2047
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,780
I usually received the three thousand

2048
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,540
dollars at a time it was always in

2049
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,560

2051
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:20,940
was in advance this container

2052
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,040
how is it container used

2053
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,040
well the top of the container is

2054
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,659
magnetized

2055
01:33:27,659 --> 01:33:31,920
and then it is left at a predetermined

2056
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,300
place

2057
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:37,020
which is called a drop under a railroad

2058
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,080
bridge under an elevated

2059
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:41,659
um

2060
01:33:41,659 --> 01:33:45,500
inside a

2061
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,780
support of a bridge or something and it

2062
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:52,460
was never lost this was a very reliable

2063
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,840
Gadget and this was used all over New

2064
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,739
York City

2065
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:57,960
or in places in New York City yes I had

2066
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,659
four different drops as this FBI photo

at Tiffany's Jewelers in New York

2070
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:11,400
beneath this Subway bridge in the Bronx

2071
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,139
was one of the drop points he had for

2072
01:34:13,139 --> 01:34:14,520
messages

2073
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,620
another was the Hudson River train line

2074
01:34:18,739 --> 01:34:21,239
another was under this railroad bridge

2075
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:24,300
in Queens at 69th Street

2076
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:26,520
another on this telephone pole in

2077
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,900
Yonkers

2078
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:30,300
once he was well established tuomi was

2079
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,800
ordered to take a job where he could

2080
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,719
carry out surveillance of the docks at

2081
01:34:33,719 --> 01:34:35,880
the Port of New York eventually he was

2082
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,040
caught by the FBI and became a double

2083
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,780
agent

2084
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,699
when you were caught by the FBI did you

2085
01:34:41,699 --> 01:34:43,500
try to Signal your Soviet handlers at

2086
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,300
the U.N or in Moscow that you had been

2087
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,480
caught

2088
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,360
not immediately because I I couldn't it

2089
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,000
was in my mind

2090
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,900
but I I couldn't do it immediately I did

2091
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,219
some

2092
01:34:59,219 --> 01:35:00,480
the

2093
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,280
a signal

2094
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,080
to the center which I Soviet

2095
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,000
intelligence Military Intelligence

2096
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,880
headquarters in Moscow I sent

2097
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,300
a signal

2098
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:14,520
three months after having copper FBI how

2099
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,580
did you send the signal what means I I

2100
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:20,219
sent the signal by inserting

2101
01:35:20,219 --> 01:35:22,620
it and uh

2102
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:26,000
uh message

2103
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,139
which

2104
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,880
I

2105
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,920
wrote on the

2106
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,300
under the control of the FBI

2107
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:39,360
but I got away from the FBI agents for a

2108
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,739
few minutes

2109
01:35:40,739 --> 01:35:42,300
uh

2110
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,420
to write that message using the using

2111
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,500
the washroom

2112
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:48,719
and was this a hidden writing technique

2113
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:53,040
that you used yes I I had an extra sheet

2114
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,060
of

2115
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:56,880
chemically treated paper which was used

2116
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,719
for secret writing and I used that in in

2117
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,340
the washroom

2118
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:05,340
there was a internal struggle in Sodom I

2119
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:08,820
was torn about apart I was

2120
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,159
pro-soviet

2121
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:14,639
I believed in a Soviet system and here I

2122
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,760
was working for the FBI the enemy

2123
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,800
of my country

2124
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,739
I I just couldn't live with the idea

2125
01:36:22,739 --> 01:36:24,679
of of

2126
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:27,540
between the Soviet Union are you still

2127
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:30,780
pro-soviet oh definitely not so what

2128
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,159
changed you I don't understand how

2129
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,679
you've changed or why you've changed

2130
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:37,199
that's uh that's a very long process

2131
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:40,920
something that doesn't happen overnight

2132
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,219
this is the KGB Blue Book where tuomi is

2133
01:36:44,219 --> 01:36:47,040
listed under his Soviet name in it he is

2134
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,639
named as an enemy of the Fatherland

2135
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:53,100
but even a spy caught and turned finds

2136
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,600
it difficult to be parted from his

2137
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,920
country

2138
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,960
because of the family

2139
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,239
your family that you had over in the

2140
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:02,580
summer yes I I had a wife and I had

2141
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:06,480
three children otherwise uh coming to

2142
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,280
back to the United States that's that's

2143
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,900
the greatest thing that ever happened to

2144
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:11,699
me

2145
01:37:11,699 --> 01:37:14,040
have you ever heard from your former

2146
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,719
wife or your children

2147
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:21,600
no I haven't heard from them since 1963

2148
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:36,540
[Music]

2149
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:40,739
on November 15 1979 Sir Anthony blunt a

2150
01:37:40,739 --> 01:37:42,719
distinguished British art historian and

2151
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:44,580
the art advisor to the queen was

2152
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:46,679
stripped of his Knighthood what happens

2153
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:48,179
now

2154
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:50,280
a sharp House of Commons have been told

2155
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,500
by the Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher that

2156
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,080
blunt had been a Soviet agent while at

2157
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,420
Cambridge University in the 30s he acted

2158
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,699
as a talent spotter for the Soviets and

2159
01:37:59,699 --> 01:38:01,080
later while a member of British

2160
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,000
intelligence he continued to pass

2161
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,639
information to the Russians by remaining

2162
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:07,440
silent about his friends involved in

2163
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,900
spying he was directly responsible for

2164
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,020
exposing British agents and operations

2165
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:16,139
in the mid-1930s it seemed to me and to

2166
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:18,239
many of my contemporaries but the

2167
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,699
Communist Party in Russia constituted

2168
01:38:20,699 --> 01:38:23,699
the only firm bull work against fascism

2169
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:25,620
since the Western democracies were

2170
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,960
taking an uncertain and compromising

2171
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:30,480
attitude towards Germany

2172
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:33,179
I was persuaded by Guy Burgess that I

2173
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:34,620
could best serve the cause of

2174
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:37,380
anti-fascism by joining him in his work

2175
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,239
for the Russians

2176
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,699
this was a case of political conference

2177
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:44,040
against royalty the country

2178
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,980
I chose conscience

2179
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,440
when later I realized the true facts

2180
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,080
about Russia I was prevented from taking

2181
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,320
any action by personal loyalty I could

2182
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,460
not denounce my friends

2183
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,980
Cambridge University in the 1930s where

2184
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,840
young men were recruited to rise up

2185
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,880
quietly to the highest ranks of the

2186
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,860
British establishment while secretly

2187
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:10,320
working for the Soviets these were the

2188
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,520
moles

2189
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,100
the most notorious was Kim philby Who

2190
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:16,920
Rose to be a senior officer in MI6 the

2191
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,020
British intelligence agency as liaison

2192
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,719
officer with the CIA philby was well

2193
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:24,179
placed to relay vital Western secrets to

2194
01:39:24,179 --> 01:39:27,360
the Soviets since 1963 philby has lived

2195
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,460
in Moscow and is a colonel in the KGB

2196
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:31,920
his tip-offs were to cost many Western

2197
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,320
agents their lives

2198
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,840
Donald McLean and Guy Burgess were

2199
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:38,699
working for the foreign office and both

2200
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:41,219
were friends of filby they also worked

2201
01:39:41,219 --> 01:39:42,780
for the Soviets until they fled to

2202
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:46,219
Moscow in 1952

2203
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,120
as head of the American Department

2204
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,520
McLean had access to these top secret

2205
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,679
briefs of President Truman's assurances

2206
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:54,840
to then British prime minister Atlee

2207
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:57,060
that American threats to use the atomic

2208
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,159
bomb in the Korean War would never be

2209
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:01,440
carried out this valuable information

2210
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,719
went straight to McLean's Soviet

2211
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:04,920
handlers

2212
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,020
but there were many Americans also

2213
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:09,480
involved in similar activities in the

2214
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:12,060
1930s Nathaniel Weil was one of

2215
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,280
thousands of Young Americans who decided

2216
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,440
that the fascism of Hitler's Germany was

2217
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,659
the true enemy and that communism was

2218
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:20,880
the answer he became a secret party

2219
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,739
member who took his orders from the

2220
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:24,600
Soviets while working for the U.S

2221
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:27,179
government we were to rise

2222
01:40:27,179 --> 01:40:30,179
until positions of as much power as we

2223
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:31,620
could in the government

2224
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,840
to influence the government in a

2225
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,719
socialist or communist Direction

2226
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,699
and uh

2227
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,400
so that in the event of our Victory

2228
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,380
there would be trained men

2229
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:47,400
to take over a major governmental

2230
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,380
tests

2231
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,480
seen here at a government conference in

2232
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,880
the 30s Nathaniel Weil was just one of

2233
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,800
many Americans secretly working for the

2234
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,620
Soviets within the U.S government

2235
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:01,500
we were to sever all connections

2236
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,199
with known Communists abruptly and

2237
01:41:04,199 --> 01:41:05,760
instantly

2238
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,000
we were not to express left-wing views

2239
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,520
under any circumstances

2240
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,100
and if we saw people who seem to have

2241
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:15,600
likely recruits

2242
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,600
we would bring the name before the group

2243
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,699
where this would be discussed

2244
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:22,679
but we would have no further contact

2245
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:24,179
with that person

2246
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:27,120
in other words a decision would be made

2247
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,219
and then some entirely different person

2248
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:31,800
would make this the approach thus

2249
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,860
preserving the uh clandestine nature of

2250
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:35,940
the cell

01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:38,940

2253
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:43,380

2254
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,960
for all treasury policy bearing on

2255

Foreign Relations he was also a Soviet

2256
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,600
mole in his sensitive position he was

2257
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,699
not only well placed to pass on

2258
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:56,219
intelligence material but to influence

2259
01:41:56,219 --> 01:41:59,100
policy decisions as well under Soviet

2260
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,619

01:42:01,619 --> 01:42:04,380
treasury secretary Henry morgenthau one

2262
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,239
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's closest

2264
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:10,800
Allies gathered at the Quebec conference

2265
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,400
in September in 1944.

2269
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,639
de-industrialization of Germany after

2270
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:26,520
the war under the pretext of permanently

2271
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,580
disabling German militarism

2272
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:32,340
it received wide publicity particularly

2273
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:34,860
in Germany where Adolf Hitler faced

2274
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,900
opposition from his own officer Corps

2275
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,239

alternative to the Grim future offered

2282
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,600
by the morgenthal plan Germany was to be

2283
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,040
shattered no matter what

01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:08,790
[Music]

2285
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:12,060
an early end to the war would have

2286
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:15,000
interfered with the Soviets plans in

2287
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,540
late 1944 their forces were still far to

2288
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:22,560
the east but by May 1945 when Germany

2289
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,960
finally surrendered all of Eastern

01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,600
Harry Dexter White's influence on behalf

2295
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,699
of the Soviets was not restricted to the

2296
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:46,500
European theater of battle

2297
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:49,139
in China the Soviets were supporting Mao

2298
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,179
tiktong in his battle against both the

2299
01:43:51,179 --> 01:43:53,159
Japanese and the Nationalist Chinese

forces of Chiang Kai-shek

2301
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,679
in 1943 President Roosevelt agreed to

2302
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:01,679
lend Chang's armies 500 million dollars

2303
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,320
for their fight against the Japanese and

2304
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,239
agreed to immediately deliver 200

2305
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,400
billion dollars in gold

2306
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,800
but White's personal control over the

2307
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,800
Chinese currency stabilization program

2308
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,360
enabled him to ignore the declared

2309
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,940
policy of Roosevelt and Congress and

2310
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,699
delay the goal shipments the Chinese

2311
01:44:20,699 --> 01:44:23,699
economy continued to collapse Paving the

2312
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:25,860
way for the eventual takeover by the

to the Nationalist Chinese

2317
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:40,500
yet he too was secretly working with the

2318
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,440
Soviets to destabilize nationalist China

2319
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,900
but it was not until a few years later

2320
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,659
that a shocked Nation learned the extent

2321
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:51,119
of Soviet penetration when Elizabeth

Soviets inside White House information

2338
01:45:39,239 --> 01:45:42,239
that Lachlan Curry had given to her he

2339
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,040
did pass on the information that the

2340
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,960
American government was just about to

2341
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,880
break the Soviet code

2342
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,400
what happened then I relayed that to the

2343
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,199
Russians they wanted know which code

2344
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:54,719
which I couldn't obviously but Elizabeth

2345
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,659
Bentley named Harry Dexter white as the

2346
01:45:57,659 --> 01:46:00,119
man who did the most damage in his

01:46:00,119 --> 01:46:01,920
appearance before a U.S congressional

2348
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,380

communist two days later he died of a

heart attack all these people were

2351
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:15,360
accused by um former Soviets by masters

2352
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,060
of being Espionage agents of the Soviet

government

2354
01:46:18,860 --> 01:46:21,360
assume that today the situation is worse

2355
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:22,860
since all of our security has broken

2358
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,880
the greatest act of Soviet Espionage was

2359
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,739
the operation to acquire the information

2360
01:46:46,739 --> 01:46:50,280
needed to build the atomic bomb

executed for relaying Atomic information

2363
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:59,460
to the Soviets but by far the most

2364
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,199
important secrets were obtained from

2365
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,960
highly placed agents working directly on

01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,960
20th century in all of the 20 years of

2421
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,900
the 22 years of the exchange program we

2422
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,580
have not sent anyone to the Soviet Union

2423
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,260
to study the things in which many

2424
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:22,020
Americans are most interested

2425
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,659
but the Soviets studying in the U.S are

2426
01:49:24,659 --> 01:49:26,219
enrolled in virtually every

2427
01:49:26,219 --> 01:49:28,440
strategically important area of research

2428
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,860
being carried out lasers microcircuitry

2429
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:34,500
and Ceramics all subjects that have

2430
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:37,139
applications to spacecraft missiles and

2431
01:49:37,139 --> 01:49:39,659
weapons aimed at the United States

2432
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:42,000
but while the Soviet Scholars are

2433
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,980
welcomed with academic courtesy in North

2434
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:46,560
America the same is not true of Western

2435
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,840
scholars in the Soviet Union

2436
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:51,000
I made a study of the exchanges from

2437
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,820
1958 through

2438
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:56,400
1975 and something like 20 percent of

2439
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,739
the American participants in the major

2440
01:49:58,739 --> 01:50:00,000
program

2441
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
were affected by the KGB in one way or

2442
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,940
another obviously followed in some cases

2443
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:09,000
harassed and intimidated in a few cases

2444
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,159
seduced and put under pressures to

2445
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:13,560
provide information about fellow

2446
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,679
students or about American Embassy

2447
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,199
officials one victim of the kgb's

2448
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,540
manipulation of exchange programs was

2449
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:24,239
Canadian Professor Johann kernigstein

2450
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:26,820
targeted because of his expertise with

2451
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:30,659
laser technology department T of the KGB

2452
01:50:30,659 --> 01:50:33,420
often Works closely with the gru Soviet

2453
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,400
Military Intelligence whose objective is

2454
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,639
to acquire military technology while

2455
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,800
visiting the Soviet Union Professor

2456
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,780
kunigstein was involved with the female

2457
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:46,619
operative of the KGB Galina nusinova

2458
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:49,139
returning to Ottawa he met with Yuri

2459
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:52,139
usati of the gru Who convinced him to

2460
01:50:52,139 --> 01:50:53,820
take a laser Along on his next visit

2461
01:50:53,820 --> 01:50:56,219
without filing the proper export

2462
01:50:56,219 --> 01:50:58,790
authorization forms

2463
01:50:58,790 --> 01:51:03,970
[Music]

2464
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,540
you because if you took it no it wasn't

2465
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,520
because why did you take it over well to

2466
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,080
do these experiments they had to be

2467
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,340
doing I didn't want to do all that

2468
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:14,480
routine kind of research

2469
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:17,460
not all technology is gained by academic

2470
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:19,739
exchanges many North American companies

2471
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:21,659
are approached on a commercial basis by

2472
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:24,960
the KGB haiko a Vancouver firm built the

2473
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,060
Pisces the most advanced deep sea

2474
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,340
submersible in the world as the Soviets

2475
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:31,679
lagged far behind the West in deep sea

2476
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:33,840
technology they were anxious to obtain

2477
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,300
the submersible so haiko was approached

2478
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,940
by a KGB agent named segalovich working

2479
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:41,639
for Department T but haiko was forbidden

2480
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:43,380
to export its product to the Soviet

2481
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,840
Union because the Pisces utilized secret

2482
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,239
welding techniques used on U.S Atomic

2483
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:50,699
submarines

2484
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:53,219
in order to avoid the export ban the

2485
01:51:53,219 --> 01:51:55,260
submersible was sent part by part to

2486
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:57,420
Switzerland where it was assembled and

2487
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,639
tested off the coast of Italy it was

2488
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:01,619
then sent to the Soviet Union giving

2489
01:52:01,619 --> 01:52:05,659
them instant parity with the West

2490
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:09,540
Department T of the KGB often devises

2491
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,820
intricate schemes using third-party

2492
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:14,400
Nationals to act as middlemen to

2493
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,100
illegally avoid export bans placed on

2494
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:20,460
strategic technology Peter virag a

2495
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:22,980
Montreal lawyer recently entered into an

2496
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:25,320
export deal involving sophisticated

2497
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:28,440
computer equipment aware the equipment

2498
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,900
would require special export licenses if

2499
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,239
destined for other countries birag

2500
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:34,739
arranged for the equipment to be

2501
01:52:34,739 --> 01:52:37,500
initially exported to Canada he then

2502
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,360
illegally re-exported the computer

2503
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:42,300
equipment to European centers where his

2504
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,580
partner sent it on to final destinations

2505
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:47,960
behind the Iron Curtain

2506
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,719
this man Mark Andre de Geiger is a

2507
01:52:51,719 --> 01:52:53,820
Belgian with business ties in the Soviet

2508
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:56,639
Union through bribery he tried to obtain

2509
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,460
a computer source code valuable to the

2510
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,739
Soviet military because it simplifies

2511
01:53:01,739 --> 01:53:04,739
computer operations thus reducing the

2512
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:08,360
size of the computer required

2513
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,920
but the transfer of American Technology

2514
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:13,139
to the Soviets is not only accomplished

2515
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:16,380
by the subterfuges of the KGB much of it

2516
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:19,080
is done openly or as Lenin had predicted

2517
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:21,300
when the time comes to hang the

2518
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,460
capitalists they will be eager to sell

2519
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,460
us the Rope

2520
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:27,739
foreign

2521
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:30,600
has sold the Soviets devices known as

2522
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:33,119
array processors which are now being

2523
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:36,060
used on Soviet killer submarines the

2524
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,100
array processors interpret underwater

2525
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,560
signals and Target the locations of

2526
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,460
other submarines

2527
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:48,600
in Corona California the principles of

2528
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:51,420
Spar Optical research incorporated were

2529
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:53,580
convicted of exporting copper water

2530
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:56,280
cooled mirrors to Europe for reshipment

2531
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,020
to the Soviet Union

2532
01:53:58,020 --> 01:54:00,659
these mirrors are essential to particle

2533
01:54:00,659 --> 01:54:03,420
beam and Laser research and the Soviet

2534
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:06,000
military is now closer to achieving the

2535
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,460
ability to destroy vital communication

2536
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:11,300
satellites

2537
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,540
a New England firm in 1972 sold the

2538
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:17,340
Soviets their product one of the most

2539
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:19,139
advanced ball bearing manufacturing

2540
01:54:19,139 --> 01:54:21,719
machines in the world the miniature ball

2541
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:23,639
bearings are essential to the successful

2542
01:54:23,639 --> 01:54:25,440
launch of multiple Warheads from a

2543
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:27,540
single missile Americans have also

2544
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:29,280
provided the Soviets with the technology

2545
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,440
critical to the guidance systems that

2546
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,540
greatly increase the accuracy of Soviet

2547
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:35,280
missiles

2548
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:38,100
Dr Miles Costick is a washington-based

2549
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:42,060
defense analyst the acquisition of

2550
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:43,860
American inertial guidance technology

2551
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:45,659
which consists of three different

2552
01:54:45,659 --> 01:54:49,320
Technologies has enabled Soviets to

2553
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:53,780
abridge a tremendous Gap in the circular

2554
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:57,420
error probable namely Precision of

2555
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,340
on-target develop delivery of their

2556
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,800
missiles when they started there were

2557
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,159
about three miles of the Target and this

2558
01:55:05,159 --> 01:55:08,100
was not so long ago about eight years

2559
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,179
ago

2560
01:55:09,179 --> 01:55:11,940
but now the Soviet missiles are accurate

2561
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:14,820
to within 600 feet of American missile

2562
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:16,020
silos

2563
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:18,360
in order to overcome this increased

2564
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,239
Soviet accuracy the MX missile system

2565
01:55:21,239 --> 01:55:24,060
has been proposed it is the largest

2566
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:26,219
construction program in the history of

2567
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:28,679
mankind with missiles on movable

2568

carriers

2569
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:33,300
and bad news which is the MX missile

2570
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:37,320
system will cost us 60 to 100 billion

2571
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:38,580
dollars

2572
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:42,119
strictly to offset the advantages which

2573
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:43,920
Soviet acquire to their scientific and

is a former KGB agent

2579
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:05,580
follows the

2580
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:07,860
statement of a very ancient Chinese

2581
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:11,100
philosopher Sanjay who was born 500

2582
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:12,119
years

2583
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:15,060
BC before Jesus Christ who said

2584
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:16,800
something to the effect that fighting

2585
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,780
war on the battlefield is the most

2586
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,719
stupid and primitive way of fighting a

2587
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:25,080
war the highest art of warfare is not to

2588
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,520
fight at all

2589
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:29,280
but to subvert anything of value in your

2590
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,280
enemies country be it moral Traditions

2591
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:35,280
religion respect to your Authority and

2592
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:39,000
leaders cultural Traditions anything

2593
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,280
put White against black

2594
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,320
old against Young

2595
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:46,739
uh I don't know wealth against poor and

2596
01:56:46,739 --> 01:56:48,360
so on doesn't matter

2597
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,760
as long as it disturbs society as long

2598
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:53,040
as it cuts the moral fiber of a Nation

2599
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,540
it's good

2600
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:56,639
and then you just take this country when

2601
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,139
everything is subverted but the country

2602
01:56:58,139 --> 01:57:00,780
is disoriented and confused when it is

2603
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:03,719
demoralized and then destabilized

2604
01:57:03,719 --> 01:57:05,820
then the crisis will come

2605
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:08,580
within the KGB is a department that

2606
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:11,040
specializes in planting false stories

2607
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,980
and forged documents to distort others

2608
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:16,199
perception of reality it is the

2609
01:57:16,199 --> 01:57:19,800
department that deals in disinformation

2610
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,159
Department a of the KGB set up and

2611
01:57:23,159 --> 01:57:25,260
controls the disinformation department

2612
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:27,780
of Czech intelligence

2613
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:30,360
ladislav bittmann was deputy director of

2614
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,099
that department when he was with Czech

2615
01:57:32,099 --> 01:57:34,580
intelligence

2616
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,960
this information can have

2617
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,840
a variety of forms it's basically

2618
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:44,300
uh an information deliberately

2619
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:48,000
misleading that is leaked through

2620
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,540
variety of channels to the opponent to

2621
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:54,239
deceive him to receive the decision

2622
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,340
makers in the United States or Germany

2623
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:58,699
or Britain or it can be a risinformation

2624
01:57:58,699 --> 01:58:02,639
to deceive the public opinion around the

2625
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,460
world or in a specific country

2626
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:08,460
you tend to be fairly good at this when

2627
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:09,659
you're with Czech intelligence didn't

2628
01:58:09,659 --> 01:58:11,780
you

2629
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:15,840
unfortunately I have to admit yes

2630
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,599
one of bittmann's audacious schemes was

2631
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,300
to recover phony Nazi storage chests

2632
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:24,179
from a Czechoslovakian Lake the chests

2633
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:26,699
were filled with genuine gestapo and SS

2634
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:29,580
documents supplied by the KGB and

2635
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,619
specifically chosen to rekindle

2636
01:58:31,619 --> 01:58:34,380
animosity towards the Germans decades

2637
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:37,199
after World War II

2638
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,840
and I was a member of the diving team

2639
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,739
and when I talked with few people in the

2640
01:58:43,739 --> 01:58:45,540
service about this we came to the

2641
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:47,940
conclusion that this is a very good

2642
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,040
opportunity to play and play a dirty

2643
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,719
game against West Germany that we would

2644
01:58:51,719 --> 01:58:53,639
actually put something on the bottom of

2645
01:58:53,639 --> 01:58:56,699
the lakes and make it a big Discovery so

2646
01:58:56,699 --> 01:59:00,239
we prepared several

2647
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:03,179
German chests supposedly they were

2648
01:59:03,179 --> 01:59:05,460
thrown into the legs by Germans who were

2649
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:09,239
just fleeing czechoslovak territory

2650
01:59:09,239 --> 01:59:11,520
the cases were brought from the bottom

2651
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,219
in front of Television cameras

2652
01:59:14,219 --> 01:59:16,619
the documents were then displayed in an

2653
01:59:16,619 --> 01:59:18,960
elaborate press conference aimed at

2654
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,300
weakening the solidarity of the NATO

2655
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:22,440
allies

2656
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:25,320
it was quite successful in Italy in

2657
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,400
France

2658
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,219
in Austria the Press of these countries

2659
01:59:29,219 --> 01:59:31,739
published them and basically the tone

2660
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:34,980
was anti-german look what these German

2661
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:38,280
bastards did to US during the war and

2662
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:40,080
made and there are so many who are still

2663
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,639
living in Germany who are the major

2664
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:45,119
targets of the disinformation campaign

2665
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,219
that you were waging I understand there

2666
01:59:47,219 --> 01:59:49,139
was two or three major

2667
01:59:49,139 --> 01:59:52,199
yeah well the target number one is of

2668
01:59:52,199 --> 01:59:54,900
course the United States it is called

2669
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,699
the Enemy Number One one of the main

2670
01:59:56,699 --> 01:59:59,340
enemy it's always used that is the

2671
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,860
official term for the United States then

2672
02:00:01,860 --> 02:00:05,000
the second major Target was the NATO

2673
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,520
alliance and the goal was the objective

2674
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:12,000
was to work toward the dissolution of

2675
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,480
NATO with the hope that after some few

2676
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:20,219
years the the the the tension within the

2677
02:00:20,219 --> 02:00:22,619
organization were

2678
02:00:22,619 --> 02:00:26,820
reach such a stage such a level that

2679
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:29,580
NATO would stop existing

2680
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:32,760
[Music]

2681
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:36,000
NATO was formed in post-war Europe as a

2682
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,920
political and Military alliance against

2683
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:40,199
the Soviets but its most effective

2684
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:42,480
opposition now comes not from Soviet

2685
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:44,880
armies but from Soviet disinformation

2686
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,400
which continually attempts to turn one

2687
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:50,900
NATO Ally against another

2688
02:00:51,420 --> 02:00:53,820
each one of these papers appears to be a

2689
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:56,159
leaked U.S government document but

2690
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,560
they're all forgeries designed to sow

2691
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,380
dissension within NATO

2692
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:03,960
this document made damaging remarks

2693
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:06,179
supposedly from former President Carter

2694
02:01:06,179 --> 02:01:09,300
about both Greece and Turkey

2695
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:11,639
this is a phony intelligence report on

2696
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:14,159
European left Wingers this is a forged

2697
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:16,440
NATO document claiming to devise ways of

2698
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:19,560
getting support for the neutron bomb

2699
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,719
a forged confidential State Department

2700
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:24,420
memo advocating economic Espionage by

2701
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:28,040
America on her own allies

2702
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,920
many forgeries have been directed

2703
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,739
against Anwar Sadat a confidential U.S

2704
02:01:34,739 --> 02:01:37,619
memo claiming his time is up

2705
02:01:37,619 --> 02:01:39,659
or false reports on former vice

2706
02:01:39,659 --> 02:01:41,639
president mondale's remarks that neither

2707
02:01:41,639 --> 02:01:44,880
Sadat nor begin are viable leaders

2708
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,739
there have been forgeries released to

2709
02:01:46,739 --> 02:01:48,960
show American suppression of Islam the

2710
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:52,500
religion of its oil suppliers

2711
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,780
yet Perhaps the most successful Soviet

2712
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:57,300
disinformation attack was on the kgb's

2713
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:00,420
main competition the CIA it began with

2714
02:02:00,420 --> 02:02:02,520
an agreement in the mid 60s between the

2715
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,320
East German and Czech intelligence

2716
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:04,880
services

2717
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:06,119
[Music]

2718
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:09,840
the two disinformation departments again

2719
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,900
under the supervision of these Soviets

2720
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:15,540
decided to start a long-term operation

2721
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:19,099
against the CIA making

2722
02:02:19,099 --> 02:02:23,400
life as hard as possible for CIA that is

2723
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:24,540
to

2724
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:26,520
to

2725
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:30,300
label many American diplomas politicians

2726
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:33,599
cultural Representatives abroad as CI

2727
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:38,480
agents and paralyzed their positions

2728
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:42,300
uh specifically in 1966

2729
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:46,199
the first major operation was to prepare

2730
02:02:46,199 --> 02:02:50,639
a book which is the worst is called who

2731
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,800
is who in CIA

2732
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,560
the book who's who in CIA was the

2733
02:02:55,560 --> 02:02:57,840
beginning of the expose that seriously

2734
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,699
undermined American intelligence

2735
02:02:59,699 --> 02:03:02,760
capabilities for almost a decade so

2736
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,380
powerful was the impact of this book

2737
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:06,780
that its imitators like Philip AGS

2738
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:08,940
covered action information bulletin

2739
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:10,980
frequently refer to it as Source

2740
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:15,800
material as do other major news sources

2741
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:19,020
it was used as a source in this ABC

2742
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:21,659
Nightly News television broadcast in

2743
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:24,780
November 1980 claiming that the Reverend

2744
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:27,780
Jim Jones had a secret CIA associate

2745
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:30,420
before the Guyana Massacre

2746
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:32,940
this man Richard Dwyer is the focal

2747
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:34,080
point of many of the questions

2748
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,300
surrounding the possible CIA involvement

2749
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:39,179
at Jonestown he's a career Diplomat who

2750
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:40,800
served insensitive posts throughout the

2751
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,320
Mideast two years ago he was the deputy

2752
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:45,840
Mission Chief in Guyana he is listed as

2753
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,540
a CIA agent in a publication that for

2754
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,980
years has specialized in such

2755
02:03:49,980 --> 02:03:52,500
allegations the CIA denies the

2756
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,080
accusation but it was lettuce love

2757
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:57,360
bitman who was one of the real authors

2758
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:00,480
of who's who in CIA and although it was

2759
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:02,580
not published under his name the book

2760
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:04,800
received exactly the attention he hoped

2761
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:05,699
it would

2762
02:04:05,699 --> 02:04:07,199
shortly after coming to the United

2763
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:08,760
States I found this book in many

2764
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:11,060
bookstores I have it at home

2765
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:15,380
and it it for example it was quoted by

2766
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:16,940
the

2767
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:20,639
covert action billeting or is this Aegis

2768
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:22,199
group the group yes that's right

2769
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:24,000
Philippines is one of one of the major

2770
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,400
sources of information about CIA man

2771
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:29,639
that's of course that's ironic because

2772
02:04:29,639 --> 02:04:33,360
that is a communist disinformation

2773
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:36,060
constant in hand is a new york-based

2774
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:37,380
journalist for Polish language

2775
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:39,900
newspapers in North America when he

2776
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:42,060
decided to expose communist agents in

2777
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:44,340
the U.S The Long Reach of the KGB

2778
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:47,820
influenced his life 76 we started away

2779
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:51,659
for exposure of Soviet and polish

2780
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:53,099
companies

2781
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:56,040
intelligence Network especially here in

2782
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:59,580
New York we exposed agents mostly

2783
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:02,820
working around the United Nations

2784
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:05,040
what agents were these who were they

2785
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,580
working for what are KGB

2786
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:10,500
a Polish communist intelligence service

2787
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:13,380
which is actually nothing but an arm of

2788
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,280
kgb2

2789
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,320
shortly after his exposes of the KGB in

2790
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,420
New York half stories were published in

2791
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:23,219
a heavily ethnic area in Winnipeg

2792
02:05:23,219 --> 02:05:25,380
several thousand miles to the west by

2793
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,659
the weekly newspaper Chas the Polish

2794
02:05:27,659 --> 02:05:28,739
times

2795
02:05:28,739 --> 02:05:32,219
in July 1978 on a day the paper had not

2796
02:05:32,219 --> 02:05:34,739
planned to publish a bizarre edition of

2797
02:05:34,739 --> 02:05:37,020
the weekly was put into circulation with

2798
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:39,960
articles and semi-nude photos designed

2799
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,119
to offend its conservative and older

2800
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:44,540
readership

2801
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:47,219
it was done in a very clever way you

2802
02:05:47,219 --> 02:05:49,199
know because

2803
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:52,080
the look of it was exactly the same SUV

2804
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:55,199
would have printed you know but some

2805
02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:57,179
things struck us right away for example

2806
02:05:57,179 --> 02:05:59,780
right on the front pages that uh

2807
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:01,860
beautifully breasted women you know

2808
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,780
which we wouldn't have never put into a

2809
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:06,119
paper simply for the same for different

2810
02:06:06,119 --> 02:06:09,360
reasons you know but our readers are

2811
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,280
mostly middle-aged people you would

2812
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,260
never dream of doing kind of things like

2813
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:15,239
that you know who inside the paper we

2814
02:06:15,239 --> 02:06:17,460
have a picture of one of our

2815
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:19,800
correspondents in the uniform of a

2816
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:22,800
German Verma you know and the letter

2817
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,280
supposedly written by Jewish writer

2818
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:30,320
referring to uh uh our journalists

2819
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:33,599
contributed to the paper Mr Hunt as a

2820
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:35,760
war criminal not to war criminal the

2821
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,099
funny part of it is that when the war

2822
02:06:38,099 --> 02:06:40,560
ended he was about 18 years old you know

2823
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,300
and yet they said that he was

2824
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:44,340
high-ranking officer you know that he

2825
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,080
has killed so many Jews and this and

2826
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:47,820
that you know and there's another

2827
02:06:47,820 --> 02:06:52,679
article portraying Mr hanoff as an agent

2828
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:53,820
of

2829
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:59,099
you take it KGB CIA FBI everything comes

2830
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:01,739
to the sun it has become a classic case

2831
02:07:01,739 --> 02:07:04,199
of Soviet block disinformation on a very

2832
02:07:04,199 --> 02:07:06,599
personal level the charges against hand

2833
02:07:06,599 --> 02:07:08,639
were also made in a letter supposedly

2834
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:10,739
written by the Jewish Defense League of

2835
02:07:10,739 --> 02:07:12,719
New York and the letter was sent out to

2836
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:14,940
advertisers of the newspaper informing

2837
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:17,099
them that chase was harboring a Nazi war

2838
02:07:17,099 --> 02:07:20,760
criminal I am polish from my belief and

2839
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:26,099
from my birth from my uh persuasion I

2840
02:07:26,099 --> 02:07:28,560
would say but my father was a German

2841
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,380
so my

2842
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:35,280
engagement in the America in the German

2843
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,320
Army was not incidental action because

2844
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:38,699
how long were you in the German Army and

2845
02:07:38,699 --> 02:07:42,239
just what did you do I was uh regular

2846
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:43,320
Soldier

2847
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:49,619
was drafted in a match of 44 March 1944

2848
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:53,219
yes when I was 17 and a half of age

2849
02:07:53,219 --> 02:07:58,159
and in February of 7 of 45 I was

2850
02:07:58,159 --> 02:08:01,679
captured by this audience

2851
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:04,139
the accusing letter was revealed to be a

2852
02:08:04,139 --> 02:08:05,940
forgery when the real Jewish Defense

2853
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:08,040
League examined this and declared it had

2854
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:10,260
not been written on their stationery and

2855
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:12,659
also that they had never accused Mr hanf

2856
02:08:12,659 --> 02:08:15,239
of any war crimes

2857
02:08:15,239 --> 02:08:17,340
what effect

2858
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:19,920
would this have had on your readership

2859
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,360
what effect did this have on your

2860
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,400
advertisers I mean what was it well

2861
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:27,360
obviously I think the main aim was to

2862
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:30,179
stop Childs being published and have the

2863
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:32,580
same editorial policy as it was you know

2864
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:35,699
since Mr mirajkowski took over and they

2865
02:08:35,699 --> 02:08:38,520
want that I'm sure to create Panic on

2866
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,320
the board of directors so that you would

2867
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:43,560
fire him and get some woolly headed

2868
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:45,360
fellow you know which would be a little

2869
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:48,380
bit softer on communism yeah there is a

2870
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:52,260
long-term plan and strategy how to

2871
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:56,159
uh how to frighten prominent exercise

2872
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:58,199
who are politically active

2873
02:08:58,199 --> 02:08:59,480
or

2874
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:02,719
organizations that are very

2875
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:04,520
an

2876
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:07,619
anti-soviet or anti-communist

2877
02:09:07,619 --> 02:09:08,880
uh

2878
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:12,679
so and I have to admit that this is a

2879
02:09:12,679 --> 02:09:15,360
relatively uneasy

2880
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:21,000
thing to do why because most Exiles most

2881
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,639
refugees or immigrants

2882
02:09:23,639 --> 02:09:25,860
have some kind of

2883
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:27,540
relations

2884
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:30,420
with the mother country with the people

2885
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:34,080
with the relatives there and they uh

2886
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:36,599
they can be even black names because

2887
02:09:36,599 --> 02:09:39,239
imagine that you have a mother there and

2888
02:09:39,239 --> 02:09:41,880
somebody comes and says so if you don't

2889
02:09:41,880 --> 02:09:44,460
cooperate or if you if you continue

2890
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:48,300
speaking against us

2891
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,280
your mother will have a very tough life

2892
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:53,119
my dear friends
