1
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,006
Okay, Eddie,
you're on your own.

2
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:45,700
Oh, come on, son. After four years, can't you
favor us a smile on your graduation day?

3
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,900
Hi, Eddie!

4
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Hi, Smiley.

5
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:59,260
What's the matter, Boss?
Couldn't you tear yourself away?

6
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,513
How was the stretch
this time, Boss? Tough?

7
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:13,665
No.

8
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,828
Which is why I didn't
crash out like always.

9
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,730
I was sure
expecting you to.

10
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,061
Nice car.

11
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:24,210
It's all yours.

12
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:26,064
Ours.

13
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,323
Everything we've got.

14
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,893
You're a swell pal, Eddie.

15
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,012
Yeah, I've heard all about it.

16
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:43,444
You've done a good job
while I was gone,

17
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,423
and I ain't forgetting it.

18
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,661
I did big, Eddie.

19
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,851
You're a lot richer than
when you went in.

20
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,499
<i>We're</i> a lot richer.

21
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:53,812
Thanks, Eddie.

22
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:57,374
Oh, I forgot to tell you. We got
a couple of new spots downtown.

23
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:58,487
Real classy.

24
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,830
I got the guy waiting
to show you the books.

25
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,483
I'll take your word for it

26
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:03,944
like always.

27
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,948
'Cause we got troubles, too.

28
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,558
I'll take care of the troubles.

29
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,413
Like when we were kids.

30
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:14,331
Me and you against
everybody, eh, Smiley?

31
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,828
Sure.

32
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:20,206
Got my rod?

33
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,738
Wearing it right
next to my heart.

34
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,395
Let me have it.

35
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:29,467
Sure.

36
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:14,950
I just can't understand it.

37
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:17,963
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.

38
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:22,948
I step off the curb. Car comes tearing
around the corner against the red light.

39
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:27,068
The cop should have picked up
the driver of that car, not me.

40
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:30,587
Say, are you a trustee?

41
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:31,628
Yes.

42
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,299
How long have you
been in this stir?

43
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,475
Three hundred odd years.

44
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,632
Gosh, it's hot here.

45
00:05:39,363 --> 00:05:42,266
Gets like this
in Florida sometimes.

46
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,539
Florida?

47
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,788
Florida never
smelled like this.

48
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,614
Like rotten eggs.

49
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:57,717
Precisely, young man,
rotten eggs.

50
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:02,185
The unpleasant odor
is caused by H₂SO₄,

51
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:05,013
Hydrogen sulfuric acid.

52
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:09,697
The most common compound
of hydrogen and sulfur.

53
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,478
Am I right?

54
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:16,902
I poisoned my wife
with a sulfur compound.

55
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,770
My young wife,

56
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,163
she was unfaithful.

57
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,989
I was a chemist.

58
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,628
What do you mean...

59
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:27,651
...was?

60
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,985
Before they hanged me.

61
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,818
Where are the rope marks?

62
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:41,363
Young man, what is the last thing you
remember before they brought you here?

63
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,905
Smiley.

64
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:52,122
Smiley.

65
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,600
That slimy
double-crossing rat

66
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,433
bludgeon me with
my own rod.

67
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,081
Where are the
bullet holes?

68
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,571
Where?

69
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,243
How do you like that?

70
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,139
He missed.

71
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,805
Sitting right next to me,
and he missed.

72
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,015
He didn't miss.

73
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,159
You're dead.

74
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,262
Huh?

75
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:29,871
We're all dead.

76
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,492
Listen to this marv,
will you?

77
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:35,827
It's true.

78
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:38,513
Only the soul
exists down here.

79
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,213
Jeez.

80
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:44,181
I always said
I'd wind up down here.

81
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,521
Look, I don't care
where I am.

82
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:51,378
I got to get Smiley.

83
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,928
There must be some
way across this camp!

84
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,413
Abandon hope, all ye
who enter here.

85
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:02,880
Lay off of me,
Screw!

86
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:05,451
Lay off of me,
will you?

87
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:07,908
I got to get out
of here.

88
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:11,010
I'm getting Smiley!

89
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,587
Lay off me, I tell you!

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,722
I got to get Smiley!

91
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,362
Brrrr.

92
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,642
What sort of
temperature is that?

93
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:10,117
It's the labor
shortage, Sire.

94
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,492
Especially the boiler
room personnel.

95
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,387
There's been
a fearful drop.

96
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,730
We're operating
at .73% of normal.

97
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:19,802
You want me to catch
my death of cold?

98
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,146
No, Sire.

99
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,214
We're short of
condemned souls.

100
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,633
I objectively suggest—

101
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,662
Warden, I have no need
of your infantile suggestions.

102
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:29,597
I'll attend to this
matter myself.

103
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:34,233
My opponent is always with some
favored mortal of his testing my prowess.

104
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,830
This time it happens to be
one Judge Frederick Parker...

105
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,662
of the New World.

106
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:43,129
Oh, we'll see who
goes down in defeat.

107
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:48,082
My beloved Sire, your powers
are wondrous to behold.

108
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:53,238
But I have lately been
beset by great problems.

109
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:56,126
My adversary is
working overtime.

110
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,228
That superior though
he may be,

111
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:01,543
and though he's set up a thousand
Judge Parkers to thwart me,

112
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:04,433
he must recognize
that I am still Master...

113
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,116
of my own sphere.

114
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:08,650
I did it, Sire.

115
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:10,674
- (Man yelling)

116
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,349
What in my domain
is that?

117
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,944
- You have no right to--

118
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:17,883
- Help!

119
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:24,345
Let go of me,
you dirty coppers!

120
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,959
I'll get every
one of you!

121
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,173
Quiet!

122
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,220
You can't hold
me here!

123
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,568
You can't keep me!
I'll--

124
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,964
What's the meaning of this?
How dare you bring him here!

125
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,487
We had no choice, Warden.

126
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,303
Cast him down
into the boiler room

127
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,865
in the 55th circle
of darkness.

128
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,454
I apologize for the intrusion, Sire.

129
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,822
Not at all, Warden.

130
00:11:24,488 --> 00:11:25,563
Pour me a drink.

131
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,577
You're not angry?

132
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:32,233
Angry? On the contrary,
I'm very pleased.

133
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:33,930
In fact,
I'm delighted.

134
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,522
To— What was his name?

135
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:42,772
You mean, the doomed soul
that was here? Kagle, Eddie Kagle?

136
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:43,915
Eddie Kagle.

137
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:45,497
You drink to him?

138
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,416
A cheap gangster?

139
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:48,449
Why not?

140
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:49,588
I love him.

141
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,795
Ever see that
face before?

142
00:11:56,972 --> 00:11:58,036
Of course.

143
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:00,622
It was just here
in this room, Eddie Kagle.

144
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:01,522
Wrong, Warden.

145
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:04,325
That happens to be a picture
of Judge Frederick Parker.

146
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:06,331
Impossible.

147
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:09,167
- They look exactly—
- Precisely.

148
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:11,288
They look exactly alike.

149
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:16,490
And this likeness is just the weapon
I need to defeat Mr. Parker.

150
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:20,807
Eddie Kagle.

151
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,507
How hot do they
want it down here?

152
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:53,936
Never gets hot enough
to suit the boss.

153
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:58,924
You think this is bad? Wait until they stick you
in one of them hot clay pits way down below.

154
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:01,315
You mean, we ain't
at bottom now?

155
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:03,760
There ain't no bottom
in this joint.

156
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:16,071
Back to work!
Back!

157
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:17,591
Back to your work!

158
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,860
I ain't taking
this no longer.

159
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,601
I'm crashing out
of this college.

160
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:31,090
Nobody crashes
out of here.

161
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,980
Nobody but Eddie Kagle.

162
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,361
He breaks out
from every place.

163
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:38,026
- I'll crash out
with you, Eddie.

164
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,320
Who are you?

165
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,488
- A pal.

166
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:45,021
I don't like pals.

167
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,510
You mean,
like Smiley?

168
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,066
How do you know
about Smiley?

169
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,176
Grapevine.

170
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:55,677
I can help you
get him.

171
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,838
I got somebody
I want to get, too.

172
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,355
- We can help
each other.

173
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,064
- Is it a deal?

174
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:04,135
We got to crash first.

175
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,615
I know how.

176
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:08,521
Next,

177
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:10,999
the Screws.

178
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:25,114
Well, Eddie?

179
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,245
Okay.

180
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:31,136
Watch your step. One false
move and I slug you.

181
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,586
I'll be extremely careful.

182
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,705
Rub that smile
off your mouth.

183
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:40,569
A guy smiled once
when he plucked me.

184
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:42,583
Certainly.

185
00:14:44,203 --> 00:14:46,226
Come on. Now.

186
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:47,642
Hey,

187
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,637
you don't stern out for something.

188
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,496
- That's the furnace.
- It's the only way.

189
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:54,825
Come on.

190
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,141
How long have you
been down here?

191
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,840
Since time immemorial.

192
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:23,112
The way you talk, you must
have had a good education.

193
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:24,309
The most liberal one.

194
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,800
I only went to third grade.

195
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,750
I went through the whole gamut
of learning. I know everything.

196
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,369
Stuck on yourself, huh?

197
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:31,404
What's your name?

198
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:35,436
Well, I have a number of aliases. I have a long
record under the name of Mephistopheles.

199
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:36,477
Greek, huh?

200
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:39,430
Well, there are some who claim
I'm more of one nation than another,

201
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,047
but that's not true, Eddie. I am
of all nations. I claim no favorites.

202
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:45,454
You look like a con man.
Look, Mephistopheles—

203
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:46,534
Call me Nick.

204
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,592
You married?

205
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,082
Millions of women
have adored me.

206
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,486
Quite a guy with
the ladies, huh?

207
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,937
I'm a fascinating fellow.

208
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:57,050
Look, I ain't playing around
with dangerous dynamite.

209
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,894
But delightful
dynamite, Eddie.

210
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,670
Live fully while you may,
and reckon not the cost.

211
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,973
Deny yourself nothing.
Fame and blaze like a torch,

212
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:06,492
and toss the part about you.

213
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:10,896
I'll make the most
of what we yet may spin...

214
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:13,714
before we, too,
into the dust, descend.

215
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,931
Your talkin' screwy.

216
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:20,001
Is it alright
if I laugh occasionally?

217
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,522
There ain't nothing
to laugh about.

218
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,065
I never saw nothing to laugh
about my whole life.

219
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:28,399
There was a time I left school and ran away from
home when I caught my folks was always drunken.

220
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:34,359
What I've been doing is try to be
somebody, and I did pretty good.

221
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:39,070
Worked myself up from where I had nothing to eat
and no place to sleep to top guy in my business.

222
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:41,809
Splendid. You're a man
after my own heart.

223
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:44,363
I wish the world was
filled with Eddies.

224
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,490
How long is it going to take
us to get up there?

225
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:49,406
Any moment now.

226
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:03,106
Alright, down there,
send it up.

227
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:10,380
Phew! Old man Schmalhausen
must be baking with rotten eggs.

228
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,341
Smells like the Devil,
too, doesn't it?

229
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:19,093
Wow, them ashes
are still hot.

230
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:22,694
Hey, Janitor. Dash them ashes with
water before you send them up.

231
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:24,007
Hey, I don't feel nothing.

232
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,540
Of course not.
You haven't got a body.

233
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:28,243
I ain't got no body? How am
I supposed to get Smiley?

234
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:31,055
Hey, you muggler, look
at what you're doing!

235
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,905
No one can see you or hear
you until I find you a body.

236
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:35,026
Now, come on, Eddie.

237
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,483
How are you
gonna find it?

238
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:37,858
Well,

239
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:40,327
everyone has his
physical counterpart,

240
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,651
his double.

241
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,845
I happen to know
where your double is.

242
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:45,825
You mean a guy
which looks like me?

243
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,900
A spitting image.

244
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,383
But suppose he doen't
want to give me his body.

245
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:50,657
He'll be asleep.

246
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,525
He won't have anything
to say about it.

247
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,382
What happens when
he wakes up?

248
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:56,104
When he wakes up,
he'll be you.

249
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,859
And who will I be?

250
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,020
You'll be him.

251
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:00,079
Huh?

252
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,188
To everyone else, you'll be him.
Our course, to yourself, you'll be yourself.

253
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:04,185
Oh.

254
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,139
Hey,

255
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:07,797
give me that again,
will you?

256
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:10,022
Ah, stop worrying about it, Eddie.
Leave everything to me.

257
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:11,908
I'm leaving nothing
to you, con man.

258
00:18:14,336 --> 00:18:17,934
I'm sorry, Eddie. It's this cold air.
It makes me irritable.

259
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:20,121
I don't like
cold climates.

260
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:21,677
I don't feel nothing.

261
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,482
And if you ain't got no body neither,
how come you feel cold?

262
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:29,402
I've been down below so long that even
my soul has gotten accustomed to the heat.

263
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,402
Hey,

264
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:33,106
if I ain't got no body,
I ain't got no fingers, right?

265
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:34,106
Right.

266
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:36,276
No fingers, no fingerprints, right?

267
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,410
Right.

268
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,065
I can get away with murder.

269
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,102
Not exactly.

270
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:42,780
Without fingers, you cannot
squeeze a trigger.

271
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:44,134
Yeah.

272
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:49,701
I'd sure wanna
squeeze a trigger.

273
00:18:55,324 --> 00:18:56,324
Hey!

274
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,810
What is this,
a double cross?

275
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,424
This ain't St. Louie.

276
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,490
Smiley is in St. Louie.

277
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,508
The body we want
is here,

278
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:08,043
and don't you forget, you have
a little job to do for me first.

279
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,991
That was our deal.

280
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:12,413
Okay.

281
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,064
I ain't reneging.

282
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:16,733
Come on.

283
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:20,808
<i> Criminal Court Building </i>

284
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:31,004
Hey!

285
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,650
What's the idea of
bringing me here?

286
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:37,273
I've got to get you the fingers
to squeeze that trigger.

287
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,344
How do you figure you're getting
into the criminal court?

288
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,408
How did I figure getting you
out of that jam down below?

289
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,610
But I did.

290
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,435
Yeah.

291
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,212
That was neat.

292
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:50,939
This will be even neater.

293
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:52,134
Trust me.

294
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:55,336
Okay.

295
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,106
Let's go.

296
00:20:02,423 --> 00:20:04,198
There ain't a seat
in the joint.

297
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,453
Let's sit here.

298
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:08,039
What's the matter with you?
There's cops in them seats.

299
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,042
Hmm, they won't mind.
They won't even know.

300
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,560
- Your Honor,

301
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:29,255
- the defendant of this case
has failed to establish an alibi.

302
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:33,920
- The testimony conclusively proves that
this man was at the scene of the crime

303
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:36,173
- and at the exact time
it was committed.

304
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:39,328
- Therefore, I respectfully
request the court—

305
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:41,894
That's a lie! I'm not going
to take any more of this!

306
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:52,102
Get a doctor, quick.

307
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,359
What happened?

308
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:55,197
He collapsed, Eddie.

309
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,006
No judge ever
passed out on me.

310
00:21:03,623 --> 00:21:05,503
- This court is now
adjourned.

311
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:09,442
Come on, Eddie.
Let's go.

312
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,538
Hey,

313
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:12,408
don't give me
no orders.

314
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,348
I do all the leading.

315
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:15,377
Get me?

316
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:17,321
Yes, Eddie.

317
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,485
Don't you never forget.

318
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,024
I'm boss.

319
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,721
Yes, Eddie.

320
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,985
I shouldn't have
been so brusque.

321
00:21:29,307 --> 00:21:32,866
I've given him a sedative. Let him
sleep a while. Then, get him home.

322
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:34,607
He'll be alright.

323
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:35,945
Sure, Doctor.

324
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,028
Alright, gentlemen.

325
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,915
He smokes.

326
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,262
I told you I knew
where your double was.

327
00:22:00,764 --> 00:22:04,652
If this guy had hung around St. Louis,
he'd have gotten bumped instead of me.

328
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,234
Too bad he didn't.

329
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:09,927
Is he the guy
you wanna get?

330
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:11,006
Yeah.

331
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,386
What'd he do to you?
Send you up?

332
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:15,277
I was sent down,

333
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:16,425
not up.

334
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:19,115
Hey,

335
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,578
this guy's a judge.

336
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,919
I ain't muscling in
on no judge's body.

337
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:26,511
What difference
does it make?

338
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,505
It will serve
your purpose

339
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:29,925
and mine.

340
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,590
Yeah.

341
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,095
What happens when
he gets up and

342
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,210
finds I'm him?

343
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:40,809
When we're through with him,
he won't know a thing.

344
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:45,004
Not a single blip,

345
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,945
solitary thing.

346
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:48,827
What about you?

347
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:52,227
Ain't you gonna find
yourself a body?

348
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:54,399
Yeah, I'll get one.

349
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:56,218
But you first,

350
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,211
you're the important one.

351
00:22:58,554 --> 00:22:59,554
Yeah,

352
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:03,149
and don't you forget it.

353
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:05,037
I won't forget it,
Eddie.

354
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:12,729
Hurry up.

355
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,760
Whatcha doing?

356
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:17,548
Fusion, Eddie.

357
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,912
The power of heat.

358
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:25,237
I'll fuse you into this man
as steel can be fused into steel.

359
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:27,909
Relax.

360
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:33,049
Relax.

361
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,043
Oh, Albert.

362
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,164
Yes, Doctor?

363
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,298
Ms. Foster still here?

364
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:08,962
Yes, sir, she's making coffee.

365
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:09,960
Oh my,

366
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:13,024
may I inquire how
the judge is, sir?

367
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,262
Oh, a good night's rest
and he'll be alright.

368
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:16,562
Oh, that's good.

369
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,680
Run down to the druggist, will you, and
get this sedative just in case he wakes up.

370
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,425
Yes, Doctor,

371
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,295
it'll be ready for him.

372
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:22,307
Is he still sleeping?

373
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:23,307
Yes.

374
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:27,229
There you are.

375
00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:28,229
Well, thanks.

376
00:24:28,564 --> 00:24:30,261
Nothing serious,
I hope, Matt.

377
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:33,211
Excellent.

378
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:35,391
No, I don't think so.

379
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:38,199
However, I've been expecting
this for some time.

380
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,513
Why do you say that?

381
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,670
One can only do so much,
especially one of Fred's temperament.

382
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:47,550
When he awakes in the morning, I suggest you pile him
into his car, and get him away for a couple weeks.

383
00:24:47,813 --> 00:24:50,561
I'm only the judge's
secretary, not his wife.

384
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:53,006
That ring means everything
you soon will be.

385
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,498
I can't possibly
go away now.

386
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,030
Why?

387
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:00,102
Well, with the election
only a few days off,

388
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:02,245
his speech in the
auditorium tomorrow.

389
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,889
Now, Barbara. You've always
had your own way,

390
00:25:05,913 --> 00:25:06,913
I suppose
you will now.

391
00:25:06,954 --> 00:25:08,249
That's not fair, Matt.

392
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:10,919
Nobody can stop, Fred.
Nobody can push him on.

393
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,229
I'm the last one who wants
to see him hurt or sick.

394
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,062
You believe that,
don't you?

395
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,599
Of course.

396
00:25:20,801 --> 00:25:23,041
I'll bring him to your office
first thing in the morning.

397
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,065
No, no.

398
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:25,554
That wouldn't do,
at all.

399
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:29,800
Not all people are ready to accept psychiatry
as a normal branch of medicine.

400
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:33,878
The general impression is a man who
needs a psychiatrist must be crazy.

401
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:36,340
Ridiculous, of course,
but there you are.

402
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,571
Some people are rather reluctant
to cast their votes for lunatics.

403
00:25:40,027 --> 00:25:41,221
I hadn't noticed.

404
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:42,937
It'd be better
if I came here.

405
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:45,966
- Goodbye, Barbara.

406
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,044
Goodbye, Matt.

407
00:25:52,061 --> 00:25:53,185
Uh, Albert?

408
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:54,920
Yes, Miss Ratliffe?

409
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,492
I'm going home,

410
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:58,514
and if the judge awakens
during the night,

411
00:25:58,708 --> 00:25:59,394
please call me.

412
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:00,927
Yes, Miss Ratliffe.

413
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:29,565
Judge.

414
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,813
Police say your appointment
is for nine sharp.

415
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:34,560
Judge!

416
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:36,630
Your Honor!

417
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,479
I hated to wake you, Sir.
You were sleeping so peacefully.

418
00:26:58,648 --> 00:26:59,639
He did it.

419
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:04,114
I got them.

420
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:05,895
But what, Sir?

421
00:27:16,192 --> 00:27:17,164
You got one, too.

422
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:18,643
I hope so, Sir.

423
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:24,307
I can feel myself.

424
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:26,459
I'm solid.

425
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:28,876
Solid, like I used to be.

426
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:30,559
Are you quite alright, Sir?

427
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:32,352
Alright? Sure, I'm alright.

428
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:33,308
Ni--

429
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:35,801
Nick—
Where's Nick?

430
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:39,408
Hey, hey. Hey!
Where are you?

431
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,026
Hey, Nick!

432
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:46,136
Did Nick sleep here, too?

433
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,985
I'm afraid I don't
follow you, Sir.

434
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,053
You better not.

435
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,485
I don't like
being followed.

436
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:52,845
Who are you, anyway?

437
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:53,787
Uh, really, Sir?

438
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:55,562
Then tell me or
do I slap it out of you.

439
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:56,987
I know, but your man-servant.

440
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:59,071
And if you'd pardon me,
your bath is ready, Sir.

441
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:00,349
I don't need
no bath.

442
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,564
They cleaned me up good
when they let me out.

443
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:04,320
Where's his duds?

444
00:28:04,354 --> 00:28:05,041
I beg your pardon?

445
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:07,219
His duds, his rags, clothes?

446
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:07,995
Whose clothes, Sir?

447
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:12,292
The judge's! I've got to get dressed
and get to St. Louis quick.

448
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:15,574
What am I, a judge
or an undertaker?

449
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,054
And you got nothin'
with fancy stripes?

450
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:19,797
Fancy stripes?

451
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:22,726
Oh, never mind.
I'll wear one of these.

452
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,776
- Alright, you double crosser.

453
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:31,064
- I'm comin' for ya.

454
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:35,975
Here you are, Sir.

455
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,678
What are you
gonna do?

456
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:40,925
Help you into
them, Sir.

457
00:28:42,415 --> 00:28:43,054
Scram.

458
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,638
- But Sir, I— I—
- Scram!

459
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:45,601
Yes, Sir.

460
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,094
Hello, Ms. Barbara?

461
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:55,453
This is Albert.

462
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,502
I-I don't wish to alarm you,

463
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,582
but the judge is definitely
not himself this morning.

464
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:03,905
I'm terribly worried
for him.

465
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,414
Oh, that'll be splendid.

466
00:29:07,561 --> 00:29:09,082
And do hurry, please.

467
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,253
Thank you.

468
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,510
- Hey, you!

469
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,277
You.

470
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:20,171
Yes, sir.

471
00:29:20,197 --> 00:29:22,297
Get me a ticket on the
next plane to St. Louis.

472
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:23,268
But, sir, you—

473
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,323
You work here,
don't you?

474
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:25,687
Well really.

475
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:27,548
- For a good many years.
- Well, get it.

476
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:28,885
But your appointment, Sir!

477
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:31,129
I got an appointment
at St. Louis,

478
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,051
which comes first.

479
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,363
Plane reservations
are hard to get,

480
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:37,107
especially on such
short notice.

481
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,192
Okay,

482
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:41,658
call the airport and get me
a special plane, all for myself.

483
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:43,616
Come ooon.

484
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:45,829
Hey.

485
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:48,579
If I need some dough,
is there any around?

486
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,517
It's the usual place, Sir.

487
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:52,769
Don't give me no double talk.
Where's the dough?

488
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:54,247
In the safe, Sir.

489
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,608
I don't see
no safe.

490
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:57,997
If I seem
to be baffled—

491
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,872
Will you shut up and
do what I tell you?

492
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,059
Where's the strong box.

493
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,890
Behind the picture, Sir.

494
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,703
There's a flock
of pictures.

495
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:07,587
The one with
the boat, Sir.

496
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,537
The button, Sir.

497
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,069
Got any sandpaper?

498
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:43,606
Have you forgotten
the combination?

499
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:47,414
I don't need no combination.
This is duck soup.

500
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:27,401
Oh please, Sir.

501
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,431
Hey,

502
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,108
where's the nearest
hard shop?

503
00:31:31,148 --> 00:31:33,283
You can't possibly leave
town today, Sir.

504
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,019
Hello, Eddie.

505
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,625
How'd you get here?

506
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,860
I never explain
my actions.

507
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:13,131
Then explain to me,
I don't like no surprises.

508
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:17,365
I have many more surprises in store for you
if you try to run out on me again.

509
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,063
I ain't running out
on nothin'.

510
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:22,594
I'm just hoppin' over to St. Louis
to take care of that rat.

511
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:25,704
That rat can wait.
Parker comes first.

512
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,355
Ah, being up so high
makes me uncomfortable.

513
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:32,696
I'm much happier
down below.

514
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,725
Yeah, huh?

515
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:37,063
I appall altitudes.

516
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,466
Hey, what's that?

517
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:44,776
Engine trouble, Sir. We'll have
to go back to the fields.

518
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,508
What a strange
coincidence.

519
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:53,153
Wipe that smile
off your mug.

520
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,847
I apologize,
most completely.

521
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:03,134
Are you sure
he said St. Louis?

522
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:04,533
Yes, Ms. Barbara.

523
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:06,493
St. Louis.

524
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:08,035
St. Louis!

525
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:10,364
I can't imagine what
could take him there!

526
00:33:10,775 --> 00:33:13,295
At a time like this, with
a thousand things to do!

527
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,973
You should've done
something, Albert.

528
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:18,246
Phone me, or-or stopped
him, or something!

529
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,618
I tried to,
Ms. Barbara.

530
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,606
But he gave me a push,
and out he went!

531
00:33:21,743 --> 00:33:23,441
Well, that's
ridiculous!

532
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:26,542
The judge is gentility itself.
He never pushed anybody.

533
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:29,401
He never did any of the things
he did this morning.

534
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:34,009
From the first time he awakened,
he-- he acted peculiarly.

535
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:35,964
Go on.

536
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:38,941
When I went to help
him dress, he uh,

537
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:41,052
he told me
to scram!

538
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:44,248
The judge said
"scram"?

539
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,986
That was the very word
he used, Ms. Barbara.

540
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:51,852
Are you certain you weren't
having hallucinations, Albert?

541
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:55,239
I only wish that were true,
it's been most disturbing.

542
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:58,474
I would've called Dr. Higgins,
but I didn't have the opportunity.

543
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:00,216
Well, I'll call
him now.

544
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,474
Very good,
Ms. Barbara.

545
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,107
Hello,
Doctor Higgins, please.

546
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:13,916
This is Barbara Foster.

547
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,237
Not a word
to anybody, Albert.

548
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,487
Oh, heavens no, Ms—

549
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:18,437
Hello, Matt.

550
00:34:18,437 --> 00:34:19,700
Look I'm at Fred's.

551
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,416
No, he isn't here!

552
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:23,761
He took a plane
for St. Louis.

553
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,868
That's extraordinary.

554
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:28,119
Well.

555
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:32,126
Don't be unduly alarmed, it may
be only a passing aberration.

556
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:34,211
We'll see when
he gets back.

557
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,178
Let me know the
moment he arrives.

558
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:38,327
And let me warn you,
Barbara.

559
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,600
No matter how strange he acts,
don't antagonize him.

560
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:43,369
Humor him,
indulge him.

561
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:45,710
Now we are dealing
with someone who's ill,

562
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,254
perhaps very ill.

563
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,943
Now you understand,
don't you, Barbara?

564
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:51,991
The important thing
is patience.

565
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,214
I understand, Matt,

566
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,149
goodbye.

567
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:58,998
Well, Albert...

568
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,223
we must be very
patient with him.

569
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,634
We will,
Ms. Barbara.

570
00:35:09,008 --> 00:35:12,146
Remember now,
not a word to a soul.

571
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:27,746
Your Honor, did you uh,
miss your plane?

572
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:28,840
Yeah.

573
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:30,875
Albert,
who is it?

574
00:35:35,256 --> 00:35:36,531
The judge
is back.

575
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,550
Darling!

576
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,733
Darling, I was so worried
about you.

577
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:46,722
Who's the dame?

578
00:35:46,888 --> 00:35:48,233
Your fiancée.

579
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,749
The girlfriend.

580
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,330
Or rather...
the judge's.

581
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,167
- Come on Eddie, make the
most of it. She's all yours.

582
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:56,404
Heeey,

583
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:59,574
this is okay.

584
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,807
It ain't only a trigger
I can squeeze.

585
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:08,538
My Darling, you've never
talked like that before.

586
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:10,953
Why are you
staring at me?

587
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:12,446
Just sizing
you up.

588
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:16,454
Not bad.

589
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:20,349
Plenty of curves, and
all in the right places.

590
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,183
Come here,
Babe.

591
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:23,074
Please, Darling.

592
00:36:23,074 --> 00:36:24,740
You don't have
to be afraid of me.

593
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:28,078
How about me and
you stepping out tonight?

594
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:30,677
'Been a long time.

595
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,902
Please, Fred.

596
00:36:33,403 --> 00:36:34,174
Fred?

597
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:35,586
You're Fred.

598
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:37,838
- Oh that's the judge's handle.
- Mm-hmm.

599
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:39,885
Who are you
talking to, Dear?

600
00:36:39,913 --> 00:36:40,702
Nick.

601
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:42,546
Oh.

602
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:44,084
Nick.

603
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:48,765
Beat it.

604
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:50,682
Scram!

605
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:51,882
Yes, Sir.

606
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,842
Fred, you never
talk to Albert—

607
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:57,360
No matter what I never, there's gonna be lots
of things you ain't never seen the judge do.

608
00:36:58,403 --> 00:36:59,666
Better get
used to it.

609
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,600
Yes Dear,
 I'll-- I'll try.

610
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:04,705
Oh please, Fred.
You're hurting me!

611
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,855
Heeey! Playing hard
to get, eh?

612
00:37:08,202 --> 00:37:09,799
What's so funny?

613
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:11,753
Sorry, Eddie. Sorry.

614
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,432
So, what's your name?

615
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,093
Oh really, Fred?

616
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,216
What's your name?

617
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:17,615
Now you certainly
know my name.

618
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,207
I wouldn't ask
if I knowed.

619
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:21,695
I'll call you a Rosie.

620
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,459
Rosie?!

621
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,320
Yeah,

622
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,267
a little number I used
to run around with.

623
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,541
Built just like you.

624
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:32,293
Come on, come on.
Relax...

625
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:34,663
I ain't such
a bad guy.

626
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:36,398
Now stop it, Fred!

627
00:37:36,398 --> 00:37:38,205
Hey who you
yellin' at?

628
00:37:41,622 --> 00:37:42,671
I'm sorry, Dear.

629
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,204
Okay.

630
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,363
You'll be late.

631
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,300
I got lots of time.

632
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:51,749
Of course, but you're doing the
auditorium to deliver your speech.

633
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:52,830
Come again?

634
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,251
Your speech, Dear.
It's getting late.

635
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:58,040
I do all my speechin'
with my rod.

636
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:00,103
- I want you to make
this speech, Eddie.

637
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:01,672
- I'll be behind you,

638
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,424
whispering
in your ear.

639
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:05,279
- It's all part
of the plan.

640
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:08,519
Hey, I think you're doing
a little too much planning.

641
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:12,106
On second thought, Dear, maybe
it'd be best if we postponed it.

642
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,484
What do you mean best? If I gotta
make a speech, I'll make it.

643
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:18,405
It'll smell,
but it's okay.

644
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,827
Perhaps you better
take a few days rest.

645
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,025
I'll call the campaign
committee and explain.

646
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,783
What's the matter,
what's the matter?

647
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:26,535
You think
I can't do it?

648
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:27,943
I know you
can, only—

649
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:28,875
Only nothin'!

650
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,345
I can do anything
I put my mind on.

651
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:32,230
Of course!

652
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:33,596
Where do we go?

653
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,160
The auditorium.

654
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:36,296
Come on,

655
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:39,355
we'll give it to 'em good.

656
00:38:40,556 --> 00:38:41,923
C'mon, Nick.

657
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,197
Just who is Nick?

658
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,556
Just a con man I'm tied in with.

659
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,468
Boy, we ain't been forgotten
by Lady Luck like I thought.

660
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:57,270
Judge Parker
collapsed on bench.

661
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,841
Now, ain't that just
too bad?

662
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:02,549
And listen
to this editorial.

663
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:07,525
"Dare we leave the helm of our ship in the hands
of a man whose physical condition is in question?"

664
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:10,318
"Now? In the stormiest period
in our state's history?"

665
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:12,010
Certainly not.

666
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,320
And as patriotic citizens, we gotta
do something about this situation.

667
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:15,975
Yeah.

668
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:17,037
Now, back in St. Louis—

669
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:18,521
Never mind St. Louis,
Shaggsy.

670
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:21,023
Whatever you did in your hometown,
we'd do it better here.

671
00:39:21,222 --> 00:39:23,824
The point is, we've got to see
that the judge stays sick.

672
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,726
We gotta see that this condition
maybe even gets worse.

673
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:28,745
Sure, Boss.
That's the idea.

674
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,735
Now, we've the judge hanging on the ropes.
Now we gotta deliver the K.O.

675
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:32,505
Yeah.

676
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:34,790
All of which is only to protect
the people, mind you.

677
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:36,277
Now, with our boy,

678
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,039
people can go about their business
in the pursuit of happiness,

679
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,723
which is coming to them,
without worry.

680
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,132
Sure.
Without worrying.

681
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:42,880
That's right.

682
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,937
Now, we're speaking
at the auditorium at two.

683
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:46,556
That'll give you
plenty of time.

684
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:48,324
Put on a good show,
Shaggsy.

685
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:51,002
One more cave in like he had
in court yesterday and...

686
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:53,647
And we'll be dusting off
the governor's chair for our boy.

687
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:54,774
Come on, boys.

688
00:39:54,774 --> 00:39:55,541
Wait a minute.

689
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:57,905
Hello?

690
00:39:58,488 --> 00:39:59,617
Hello, Sweetheart.

691
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:01,699
My wife, go ahead.

692
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:05,345
And remember, I want to hear that the judge
has taken a turn for the worst.

693
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:07,033
We'll bring back
his teeth.

694
00:40:07,033 --> 00:40:08,033
Come on.

695
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:13,100
"A Vote for Parker is a Vote for Yourself
 Sponsored by the Citizen's Better Government Committee"

696
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,988
- Hey...

697
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,401
- imagine me
running for governor.

698
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:18,121
Oh Darling,
you're too modest.

699
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,826
Come on, let's go
on the stage.

700
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:23,377
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I want to case the joint first.

701
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,535
Hey...
Look at that turnout.

702
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,740
Hey, what are you going
backwards for?

703
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,935
Stick close.

704
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:52,475
You're giving me the words,
remember?

705
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:55,744
Oh there is His Honor now,
excuse me.

706
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:57,958
Hey, where are you?

707
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,011
Please, Darling.

708
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,994
Well, Your Honor,
we're all ready to start.

709
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:01,782
Where is Nick?

710
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:02,470
They're waiting.

711
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,653
Let 'em wait.

712
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:05,896
Hey,

713
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:07,933
where did he go?

714
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,951
There's someone
with His Honor?

715
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:11,603
I'm sure we can
find him a seat.

716
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:12,937
Oh, that'll be fine.

717
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:14,892
Darling. Darling.

718
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,670
Please, Darling,
everyone's waiting.

719
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,756
I need Nick to help me
with the words.

720
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,493
You have your speech
right here.

721
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:33,375
Have a seat, Judge. I was
getting a little worried about you.

722
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,607
Children...
you're all ready.

723
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:43,412
Now it's time,
go ahead.

724
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:48,910
Your Honor?

725
00:41:49,352 --> 00:41:50,646
Stand up, Dear.

726
00:41:54,372 --> 00:42:00,108
"Your Honor, on behalf of all the boys
and girls and members of the club" ...

727
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:03,019
"and in gratitude for all
you have done for them,"

728
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:05,012
"regardless of who
they are" ...

729
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,994
"Regardless of who
they are..."

730
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:10,653
<b>-</b> And where they
come from.

731
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:15,409
"And where they come from,
we want to present you with" ...

732
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:24,223
I lost-ed it.

733
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:25,561
Look in this pocket.

734
00:42:27,637 --> 00:42:29,096
Whoa!
There it is!

735
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:30,902
Jeez.

736
00:42:33,503 --> 00:42:35,461
"This watch."

737
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:44,623
Thank the children,
Darling.

738
00:42:45,149 --> 00:42:46,219
Thanks kids.

739
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:47,596
You're welcome,
Your Honor.

740
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:50,247
Alright, children.
Moving this way.

741
00:43:06,622 --> 00:43:07,764
Fellow Americans,

742
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:12,663
as the campaign for governor of this
great state goes into its final phase,

743
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:15,540
it is an honor and a privilege
to speak once again

744
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:18,924
in behalf of the candidate of the Citizens
of Better Government Committee,

745
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:21,378
Judge Frederick Parker.

746
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:27,775
Judge Parker
Youth Movement

747
00:43:30,677 --> 00:43:35,512
The whole country knows of the
famous Parker Youth Foundation

748
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:39,220
created by our candidate
10 years ago.

749
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:43,826
This one organization
has reduced juvenile crime

750
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:46,876
97%
since it was found.

751
00:43:55,558 --> 00:43:59,307
Because Judge Parker
is a man who understands

752
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:04,524
that juvenile delinquency is not
a matter of bad boys and good boys

753
00:44:04,832 --> 00:44:08,171
but rather a matter of bad
conditions and good conditions,

754
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:12,909
he is a man revered
and loved by his friends,

755
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,567
respected and feared
by his enemies.

756
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:17,920
A man of
countless virtues.

757
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:24,494
Ladies and Gentlemen,

758
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:29,933
as we have just seen, one of Judge Parker's
numerous virtues is his modesty.

759
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:31,896
What's the idea,
letting me down?

760
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:34,162
I'm not letting you down.
Far from it.

761
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:35,314
What about this?

762
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:36,636
Throw it away.

763
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,397
Go out there
and tell 'em off.

764
00:44:38,526 --> 00:44:40,821
Tell 'em off.
What do I say?

765
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:43,057
Surely I don't have
to tell you that.

766
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:45,330
These people sent you
to prison, Eddie.

767
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,729
They're your enemies.

768
00:44:46,853 --> 00:44:49,553
"For thou shall not gang."
The Law-and-Order Brigade—

769
00:44:49,577 --> 00:44:50,577
—They hate you.

770
00:44:50,795 --> 00:44:52,161
They've always
hated you.

771
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:54,535
Now is your chance to tell them
what you think of them.

772
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:57,245
- You're not afraid...
- I ain't afraid of nothin'.

773
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,959
Then go out there
and give it to them.

774
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:01,210
Call them by their
right names—

775
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,540
- Call them every name
you can think of.  - Yeah.

776
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:08,228
It is my privilege to introduce
the next Governor of this great state,

777
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:10,102
Judge Frederick Parker.

778
00:45:10,102 --> 00:45:11,186
I'll tell them.

779
00:45:50,537 --> 00:45:52,439
Listen!
All of you!

780
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,816
I'm gonna  tell ya
a few things.

781
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,964
You're--

782
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:08,459
Hey you!

783
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:15,671
He's using jiu jitsu.

784
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:38,374
Stop it, Eddie, stop it.
They're your friends.

785
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:39,731
They are crazy.

786
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,152
See that?

787
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:46,805
Take it, Eddie. Take it.

788
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:56,386
It's not you they're after.
It's the judge.

789
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:58,153
Yeah, but I'm getting
the punches.

790
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:00,988
But you're making
a hero of the judge.

791
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:02,871
You want 'em to make
mince meat of me?

792
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:09,932
Idiot.

793
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:13,487
Beat it, beat it!

794
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:17,130
On your feet, get out
of here, get going.

795
00:47:18,726 --> 00:47:20,823
No I won't need that now,
Mr. Kramer, thank you.

796
00:47:21,915 --> 00:47:23,859
Are you hurt very much, Your Honor?

797
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:24,693
Nah.

798
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,355
Sure you're
alright, Dear?

799
00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:27,582
You able to walk?

800
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:29,116
Sure! Sure.

801
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:31,674
Gee, judge, Your Honor.
You're a champ.

802
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:33,610
May I kiss you?

803
00:47:33,652 --> 00:47:36,069
The judge don't want
girls to kiss him.

804
00:47:36,391 --> 00:47:38,643
You go right ahead, Dear,
if you want to.

805
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:53,573
Come on, Babe.

806
00:47:55,296 --> 00:47:56,339
Hey,

807
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:57,646
where's Nick?

808
00:47:57,646 --> 00:47:59,486
Oh never mind,
Nick now, Dear. Please.

809
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:00,733
Well he was with—

810
00:48:08,964 --> 00:48:11,404
Albert, get me some antiseptics
and bandages quickly.

811
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:12,475
Yes, Ms. Barbara.

812
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:14,382
Darling, you were
magnificent.

813
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:17,544
But you know you weren't
cut out for that sort of thing.

814
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:19,575
You know somebody who
could've done it better?

815
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:20,859
No, Dear.

816
00:48:20,992 --> 00:48:23,525
But I'm afraid of the after-effects.
I know you're going to be ill.

817
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,068
Hey, I've ain't never
been sick in my life.

818
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:27,016
Fred, you were just—

819
00:48:27,016 --> 00:48:28,290
I'm glad Nick
ain't here.

820
00:48:28,431 --> 00:48:30,842
Darling... what's come
over you?

821
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:34,836
What's this?
Hey!

822
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:36,516
Take that junk
out of here.

823
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:37,661
And get me
a drink.

824
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:39,061
The mineral water,
Sir?

825
00:48:39,364 --> 00:48:40,594
I said a drink—

826
00:48:41,134 --> 00:48:41,935
bourbon.

827
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,544
Fred, you don't drink.

828
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:44,817
You just watch me.

829
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,392
And some cigars.

830
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:48,814
But Fred, you can't smoke
or drink. You know that.

831
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:50,169
Are you kidding?

832
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:52,001
What are you
standing there for?

833
00:48:52,467 --> 00:48:53,118
Get.

834
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,810
Darling, please.
You'll only make yourself ill.

835
00:48:57,858 --> 00:48:59,815
Stop worrying,
Rosie.

836
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:03,623
Hey, how about some
smooching.

837
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,845
Darling...
you have changed.

838
00:49:30,783 --> 00:49:31,742
Want a shot?

839
00:49:32,147 --> 00:49:35,249
I wish you wouldn't, Dear. You've had
enough excitement for one day.

840
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,122
I ain't started, yet.

841
00:49:38,784 --> 00:49:39,782
Take a powder.

842
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,316
Take a powder, Sir?

843
00:49:44,056 --> 00:49:45,746
Oh, you mean scram.

844
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,642
Here's luck, Rosie.

845
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,294
Be careful, Dear.

846
00:49:51,645 --> 00:49:53,667
I can do this
all day.

847
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:20,332
That's funny, I've never
choked on this before.

848
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:43,138
What kind of a body
did that lug slip me, anyhow?

849
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:45,437
I better have Albert
put you to bed.

850
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:46,461
Hey, wa—

851
00:50:46,853 --> 00:50:48,222
I ain't sleepy.

852
00:50:50,311 --> 00:50:52,248
You feel good.

853
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:53,991
I've got to get
home, Dear.

854
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:54,836
Home?

855
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:57,222
Don't you
live here?

856
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,014
You know perfectly well,
I don't live here.

857
00:51:01,302 --> 00:51:03,830
The judge must be
screwy or something.

858
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,923
You ain't going
home, Rosie.

859
00:51:06,985 --> 00:51:09,351
I am going home,
and the sooner the better.

860
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:11,207
Wait a minute,
wait, hey—

861
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:12,207
Darling!

862
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,503
Uh... Oh, Fred,
I told you.

863
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,422
That's alright.
I'm alright.

864
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,427
You don't have
to worry about me.

865
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:22,677
I'm— I've nothing
in my way.

866
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:25,028
I feel fine.

867
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,747
Ms. Barbara!
What happened?

868
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:34,705
His Honor
just passed out.

869
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:44,287
Taxi?

870
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:45,824
Yes, Ma'am.

871
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,442
Hey, what's the idea?

872
00:52:03,556 --> 00:52:05,578
Get back in your cab
or I'll slug you.

873
00:52:05,578 --> 00:52:07,232
Ahhh,
don't get excited.

874
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:08,918
Come on.

875
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,815
No, Eddie.
Let's take this one.

876
00:52:16,144 --> 00:52:17,430
Criminal court,
please.

877
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,168
Yes, Ma'am.

878
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:28,450
I have the the sworn affidavits and depositions
for those witnesses in Chicago.

879
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,893
They came in the mail
this morning.

880
00:52:29,932 --> 00:52:31,465
What witnesses?
What's all this about?

881
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:36,308
Chicago should be pretty familiar to you. I understand
your bosom pal has opened a couple of night spots there.

882
00:52:36,507 --> 00:52:37,772
You mean Smiley?

883
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,304
Who's Smiley dear? I don't see
his name in these documents.

884
00:52:41,304 --> 00:52:44,884
When I'm finished with him, the only place
you'll find his name will be on a tombstone.

885
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,444
Well what is he to do
with the Bentley trial?

886
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:50,224
I don't know no Bentley.
All I know—

887
00:52:50,224 --> 00:52:51,491
It's Bentley trial, dear.

888
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,516
The case you're hearing
in court today.

889
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:55,897
Don't worry, Eddie.
I'll be there.

890
00:52:56,096 --> 00:52:57,863
This gives you
another go at Parker.

891
00:52:57,902 --> 00:52:59,850
You be sure you don't
bungle it this time.

892
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:01,758
Sure, sure. I know
all about trials.

893
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:04,200
So do you, bub.

894
00:53:05,464 --> 00:53:07,314
Are you talking
to the cab driver, dear?

895
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:09,524
Keep your eye front.
You want us to get killed?

896
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,311
Sorry, Your Honor.

897
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:13,574
Dear, listen to me.

898
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,219
I was talking
to Doctor Higgins.

899
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:17,775
- He said—  - Listen, Rosie.
I'm handling it my way.

900
00:53:17,775 --> 00:53:19,055
First, comes Bentley,

901
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,957
- then, comes that St. Louis, two faced,
double crossing, back stabbing—  - Fred!

902
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:29,091
I'll show you a few tricks on how to get Smiley.
Tricks you'd never even dreamed of.

903
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:32,686
Sure, sure. I go through
with the trial in nothing flat.

904
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:35,718
And then, we shoot
out to St. Louis.

905
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,411
What will we do
in St. Louis, dear?

906
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,372
Not you, just us.

907
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:42,325
Not— Not me?

908
00:53:42,897 --> 00:53:43,747
Just us?

909
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:47,262
Oh, Darling. You frighten
me when you talk like this.

910
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:49,625
It is strictly between
me and Smiley.

911
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:53,091
We're going south
together.

912
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:55,594
On— On a vacation?

913
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:56,836
To Florida?

914
00:53:57,854 --> 00:53:58,986
Further south.

915
00:54:00,312 --> 00:54:02,453
It's a hundred-times
hotter.

916
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:12,867
Boss, I tell you, them's
his honest own words...

917
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:14,198
...and get this,

918
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:17,660
he said he was going to rush through with
the trial and hop to St. Louis to get Smiley!

919
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,858
That's dangerous talk for a judge and
a gubernatorial candidate to make.

920
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:22,942
You sure
you heard right?

921
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:24,385
You're positive?

922
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:26,761
Yeah, he called him a double-
crossing, back-stabber,

923
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:28,669
who's running a racket
with the judge's dough.

924
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:29,857
Nice work, Jim.

925
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,559
Boys, we're in.

926
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:35,322
The honorable judge just put
himself right out of the running.

927
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,931
Shaggsy, that hunch
of yours was right.

928
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:38,741
This judge not only
looks like Eddie,

929
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:42,371
he's the biggest two-timing, double-crossing
candidate that ever ran for office.

930
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:44,194
He's even worse
than our own man.

931
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,344
You calling the judge?

932
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:47,941
I'm calling Smiley.

933
00:54:51,353 --> 00:54:54,497
This looks like what they put on a guy
when giving a neck tie party.

934
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:56,348
Now tell me the rap
on these Bentleys.

935
00:54:56,348 --> 00:54:57,631
Attempted murder.

936
00:54:57,818 --> 00:55:01,445
Mrs. Bentley and her husband tried
to kill her father and collect his insurance.

937
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:03,151
- One of them
things, eh?  - Mm-hmm.

938
00:55:03,152 --> 00:55:05,051
They pushed him in front
of a subway train.

939
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:06,693
But they bungled it,
the fools.

940
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:09,253
The old man's alive,
but somewhat mangled.

941
00:55:09,277 --> 00:55:11,800
The entire country is shocked
by the ugliness of it.

942
00:55:12,793 --> 00:55:15,210
Somehow they fail
to see any beauty in it.

943
00:55:15,264 --> 00:55:16,526
What chance they got?

944
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:18,570
Judge Parker?
None.

945
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:22,739
Or they wouldn't have spent all that money
trying to square things before coming up to trial.

946
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:24,912
Did they try to get
to judge Parker?

947
00:55:25,096 --> 00:55:26,307
No, no, no, no.

948
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,891
They wouldn't do that.

949
00:55:28,384 --> 00:55:31,122
They know it's impossible
to fix Judge Parker.

950
00:55:31,724 --> 00:55:33,530
But Eddie Kagle,
now...

951
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,201
Hey, who's spreading
the dough?

952
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,483
A man known
as Big Harry.

953
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:41,268
Oh, what's his
last name?

954
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:43,550
I can't look up
no Big Harry.

955
00:55:43,627 --> 00:55:46,432
I want to call him up and have him
come here quick before the trial.

956
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:47,902
No, he's too smart
for that.

957
00:55:48,032 --> 00:55:49,237
- Then, what'll I do?

958
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:54,634
Well, you just dial
Spring 74242.

959
00:55:54,772 --> 00:55:56,270
I'll guide you.
A little...

960
00:55:56,915 --> 00:55:58,429
...telepathic
transmission.

961
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:01,188
Always showin' off
with them big words.

962
00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:04,914
I used to dish out plenty of dough
myself when I put in a fix.

963
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,732
Now is my chance to get
some of it back.

964
00:56:09,725 --> 00:56:13,409
Twenty five grand ain't enough
to fix a rap like what this is.

965
00:56:13,772 --> 00:56:15,876
- Why it's— it's...
- Heinous?

966
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,033
It's heinous.

967
00:56:17,033 --> 00:56:18,696
- The whole country
is aroused by it.

968
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,375
Yeah, it's aroused
the whole country.

969
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:21,732
- But Your Honor...
uh...

970
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:26,401
As is the case of the People
vs Mitchell 186 New York 942.

971
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:30,725
Like in the case of the People
vs Mitchell 186 New York 942.

972
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,170
They got 30 years.

973
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:36,361
You don't want the Bentleys
to do a thirty-year hitch, do you?

974
00:56:36,592 --> 00:56:38,029
No, Your Honor. But...

975
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:41,510
If you'll only be reasonable.
Let me bring the Bentleys in.

976
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,234
Mmm...

977
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,680
So you can have witnesses
for the fix, huh?

978
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:48,762
No, Your Honor. I just— just
want you to see them and...

979
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,609
- ...and have them say a word
of their own defense—  - Wait.

980
00:56:52,282 --> 00:56:54,657
Put the moolah
on the desk, first.

981
00:57:18,886 --> 00:57:20,765
Your Honor, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Bentley.

982
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:25,021
They will tell you that this whole affair was
merely the result of a tragic misunderstanding.

983
00:57:25,135 --> 00:57:27,422
This fine, upstanding citizen...

984
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:30,920
...and this frail, innocent,
law-abiding, little lady,

985
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,105
who were simply
victims of circumstance.

986
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:38,595
As a result of which, Mrs. Bentley has been
under the constant care of her physician.

987
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:41,963
She's lost weight.
She's been unable to—

988
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,096
Rosie.

989
00:57:51,328 --> 00:57:53,621
Rosie Morgan.

990
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:58,208
It can't be.

991
00:57:59,115 --> 00:58:00,199
You was bumped.

992
00:58:00,753 --> 00:58:01,896
You was bumped!

993
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,744
You didn't wait long to get
hooked up with this lug, did you?

994
00:58:04,786 --> 00:58:06,083
- Your Honor—
- Shut up.

995
00:58:06,138 --> 00:58:07,614
Easy, Eddie.
Don't ruin everything.

996
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:08,974
You shut up, too.

997
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:13,558
All them trips to Kansas City to see
your poor, old, crippled mother.

998
00:58:13,735 --> 00:58:14,572
And you!

999
00:58:14,596 --> 00:58:15,876
- Your Honor,
get hold of yourself.

1000
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,684
So, this was your
mother, huh?

1001
00:58:17,684 --> 00:58:20,559
You little two-timer. Playing
around with him all the time.

1002
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,567
But I got ya now.

1003
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:24,457
When the trial starts...

1004
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,560
I'll throw the book at you. I'll give you the works.
I'll sort you and him away for keeps.

1005
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:29,584
(Rosie screams)

1006
00:58:30,827 --> 00:58:32,215
- Your Honor,
the court is ready sir.

1007
00:58:32,215 --> 00:58:35,138
Here's your dough. You can't
fix this rap. Not for a million.

1008
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:37,002
Not for all the dough
in the country.

1009
00:58:37,201 --> 00:58:39,613
- Your Honor, they trying
to bribe you?  - Ha-ha-ha.

1010
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,702
Imagine!

1011
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:42,812
Wait til I tell the story
to the Press, Your Honor.

1012
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:45,155
After this, you're a cinch to
sit in the governor's chair.

1013
00:58:45,181 --> 00:58:46,261
Heeey...

1014
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:48,480
Don't you never
say "chair" to me.

1015
00:58:48,676 --> 00:58:49,714
Oh, I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

1016
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:51,717
You fool.

1017
00:58:51,766 --> 00:58:54,979
You unmitigated,
abysmal fool.

1018
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,480
If you had a body,
I'd tear it apart.

1019
00:59:05,377 --> 00:59:07,801
Good thing you can
do that trick.

1020
00:59:10,688 --> 00:59:12,909
You should see him.
He's gotten worse.

1021
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:14,408
He's somebody
I don't know anymore.

1022
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:17,568
What is it Matt?
What's happened to Fred?

1023
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:22,287
It isn't as simple as diagnosing
a case of measles.

1024
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:24,767
No, thank you.

1025
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:28,076
Could be throwback
to his formative years.

1026
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:30,807
His young years,
his boyhood years when he

1027
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,019
lived in the slums.

1028
00:59:32,054 --> 00:59:33,527
But what caused it?

1029
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,603
Fear probably.

1030
00:59:36,103 --> 00:59:37,004
Of what?

1031
00:59:39,045 --> 00:59:41,659
Well, he might be afraid of the
high office he's running for.

1032
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,937
Fear to being elected.

1033
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:45,552
Fear of the responsibilities
it might mean.

1034
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:49,071
Fear of loving
a woman like you.

1035
00:59:49,259 --> 00:59:50,470
A woman like me?

1036
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:51,184
- Yes.

1037
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,122
Barbara.

1038
00:59:53,836 --> 00:59:55,879
I think Fred's withdrawn
from the campaign.

1039
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:57,063
- Are you serious?

1040
00:59:57,063 --> 00:59:58,064
Deadly serious.

1041
00:59:58,242 --> 01:00:00,657
But you can't be. He's as good
as elected right now.

1042
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,577
- Yes, I know.

1043
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:03,772
He'll be alright.

1044
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:05,434
He's got to be.

1045
01:00:05,746 --> 01:00:07,283
He's got to be
governor.

1046
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:11,866
From judge's secretary
to governor's wife. Not bad.

1047
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,143
Why, Matt!

1048
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:15,624
Barbara.

1049
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,184
We've been friends
for a long time.

1050
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:20,415
You're the loveliest girl
I've ever known.

1051
01:00:20,569 --> 01:00:22,206
You're also the
most ambitious.

1052
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:22,977
Yes, Matt.

1053
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,091
I am.

1054
01:00:25,136 --> 01:00:26,422
See, I'm not
a psychiatrist.

1055
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:28,979
I don't know much about
neurotic conditions.

1056
01:00:29,444 --> 01:00:31,972
But I do know that what
Fred is doing, he must do.

1057
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:36,503
Psychiatry won't give a lot of poor kids a chance
to grow up like decent human beings.

1058
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:38,048
Fred Parker will.

1059
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:41,089
Psychiatry won't wipe out the
vicious elements in this world.

1060
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,261
But the influence of
Governor Parker will.

1061
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:48,080
And this ambitious wench, Barbara Foster,
is going to help him do it.

1062
01:00:49,477 --> 01:00:50,562
I'm sorry, Barbara.

1063
01:00:51,922 --> 01:00:53,177
I guess I was
mistaking you.

1064
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,416
Forgive me?

1065
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:56,563
I'm sorry, too.

1066
01:00:56,866 --> 01:01:00,106
I'm sorry that a man like Fred has
to pay for all this with his health.

1067
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,010
But I...

1068
01:01:02,851 --> 01:01:04,690
Well, perhaps
it'll work out.

1069
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,739
As a matter of fact, his condition
may pass as quickly as it came.

1070
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:11,330
But he must be handled with
patience and understanding.

1071
01:01:12,265 --> 01:01:13,590
It's going to be
difficult for you.

1072
01:01:13,614 --> 01:01:15,938
Nothing is difficult
where Fred is concerned.

1073
01:01:16,164 --> 01:01:19,450
If you could possibly get him away for
a short while, it would help enormously.

1074
01:01:19,691 --> 01:01:20,655
I'll do my best.

1075
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:21,889
Good.

1076
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:25,257
Still friends?

1077
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:26,863
Of course.

1078
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:28,171
Always.

1079
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:29,545
Goodbye, Matt.

1080
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,977
Lovely, isn't she?

1081
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:46,832
Go ahead, Eddie. Make the
most of it, she's all yours.

1082
01:01:49,398 --> 01:01:50,827
Nah.

1083
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:53,496
This dame ain't
like Rosie.

1084
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:59,036
Why I sent for you
so sudden is this, Smiley.

1085
01:01:59,078 --> 01:02:02,088
You've been negotiating to operate
in the east the same as St. Louis.

1086
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:06,251
Which is ok with me and the boys, on certain
good and reasonable conditions, of course.

1087
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,341
I got conditions, too.

1088
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:11,309
Oh sure. We're not going to have
any argument about percentages.

1089
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:13,282
There's only
one question.

1090
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,126
- Shoot.

1091
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:15,278
Eddie Kagle.

1092
01:02:18,064 --> 01:02:19,073
What about him?

1093
01:02:19,355 --> 01:02:20,959
Well, now
that he's out...

1094
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:22,498
free again,

1095
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:23,781
Ain't you heard?

1096
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,796
Eddie ain't around
anymore.

1097
01:02:26,048 --> 01:02:26,959
He ain't?

1098
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:30,001
Yeah, he was bumped off
the minute he graduated college.

1099
01:02:31,275 --> 01:02:32,349
Oh, what do you know?

1100
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:35,522
That means you're
top dog now.

1101
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:36,736
Nobody else.

1102
01:02:37,467 --> 01:02:40,713
And you're operating alone? You don't
have to ask nobody about nothin'?

1103
01:02:41,272 --> 01:02:42,489
You're learning fast.

1104
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:47,596
You wouldn't be holding out any important
information on us, would you, Smiley?

1105
01:02:47,707 --> 01:02:48,817
Let's ask "for instance."

1106
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:51,681
For instance,
like silent partners.

1107
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:55,473
You know, someone way up in political circles
that's maybe getting a cut out of everything?

1108
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:58,341
I told you I operate
strictly alone.

1109
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:00,179
We heard different.

1110
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:03,850
And we heard it straight,
Smiley.

1111
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:06,821
You're hearing it
straight from me.

1112
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:09,737
Yours truly,
Smiley Williams.

1113
01:03:10,535 --> 01:03:12,990
Alright, Smiley.
If you say so.

1114
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:16,618
After all, if you ain't exactly
telling us the truth,

1115
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,926
they'd be complications,
with somebody who'd get hurt.

1116
01:03:20,104 --> 01:03:21,930
It's always the other
guy who gets hurt.

1117
01:03:22,848 --> 01:03:23,841
Not me.

1118
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:27,151
Send him to the judge's house.
That'll settle both of 'em.

1119
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:28,674
- Just get them together.

1120
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:31,029
Tell you what, Smiley.
I just had a thought.

1121
01:03:31,196 --> 01:03:33,608
Before you open up,
there's a guy you gotta see.

1122
01:03:33,924 --> 01:03:36,110
If he gives you the ok,
we'll do business.

1123
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:37,379
Is he the juice?

1124
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:38,737
Yeah, the juice.

1125
01:03:39,307 --> 01:03:41,007
I'll give you his
name and address.

1126
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:44,408
You'd better call
on him right away.

1127
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,918
If he's not
at home,

1128
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:49,391
wait for him.

1129
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:53,578
Judge?

1130
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:56,039
A judge, huh?

1131
01:03:56,593 --> 01:03:57,608
Frederick Parker.

1132
01:03:57,608 --> 01:03:58,918
Better be getting
on over there.

1133
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,822
Hah. Is he the juice?

1134
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,341
Running for governor, too.

1135
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:03,833
Surprised?

1136
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:05,123
Yeah.

1137
01:04:05,123 --> 01:04:06,367
I thought
you would be.

1138
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,102
Is he tough?

1139
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:10,458
You tell us. We'll be waiting
to hear how you come out.

1140
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:11,526
Bye, Smiley.

1141
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:12,922
So long.

1142
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:21,424
My children, my children.
You'd be lost without me.

1143
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:32,973
The governor's mansion is alright,
but this is where we really live.

1144
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,770
Should we go in?

1145
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:38,677
In? Where?

1146
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,576
In our house, silly.

1147
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:41,480
Oh.

1148
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:43,022
Sure.

1149
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:45,144
Can't you
just see it?

1150
01:04:45,309 --> 01:04:47,153
Shining and beautiful.

1151
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:51,133
Remember darling, all the fun
we had planning all this?

1152
01:04:51,746 --> 01:04:54,723
Location, and the rooms
and the garden?

1153
01:04:57,956 --> 01:04:59,962
Come on, let's go up
those cedar steps.

1154
01:05:07,013 --> 01:05:08,059
Careful now.

1155
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:10,836
Now, we're on
our porch.

1156
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:13,759
Oh, Darling. We'll spend
a lot of time out here.

1157
01:05:14,226 --> 01:05:17,060
After dinner, in the evenings,
when it's quiet and peaceful.

1158
01:05:17,986 --> 01:05:19,303
Let's go inside.

1159
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:22,471
Hey, oh wait.

1160
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:23,434
What's the matter?

1161
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,143
You have to
open the door.

1162
01:05:25,231 --> 01:05:26,065
Oh.

1163
01:05:28,826 --> 01:05:30,317
Come in, dear.

1164
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,360
Now then.

1165
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,114
Hey.

1166
01:05:32,946 --> 01:05:34,749
You forgot to
close the door.

1167
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:38,691
When we're married, I'm going to insist
that you carry me across the threshold.

1168
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,311
When...

1169
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,699
When we get
married, huh?

1170
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,978
Well, don't say it
so gloomly, dear.

1171
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:47,577
It won't be
that bad.

1172
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:49,020
Now.

1173
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,964
Over here
is your study.

1174
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,800
Your private
sacred room.

1175
01:05:53,342 --> 01:05:57,105
And they'll be pictures of all the great men
of law, and literature, and politics.

1176
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:00,613
And over here by the window,
will be your law library.

1177
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:04,053
And a big lounging chair for you
to plop down and read.

1178
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,148
Will I wanna do any reading
with you in the house?

1179
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:08,632
Fred.

1180
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,658
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1181
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:15,379
There's a lot of nice things
I wanna say to you.

1182
01:06:15,966 --> 01:06:17,295
Say them to me
in there.

1183
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,715
That's the most important
room in the house.

1184
01:06:20,127 --> 01:06:21,443
What is it?
The kitchen?

1185
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:22,057
No.

1186
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:23,474
The nursery.

1187
01:06:31,231 --> 01:06:32,276
You mean...

1188
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:35,880
you want to live here
with me and...

1189
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:38,695
have kids?

1190
01:06:39,645 --> 01:06:40,974
Sit on a porch?

1191
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:42,392
Of course, darling.

1192
01:06:47,946 --> 01:06:49,278
Look at me.

1193
01:06:51,594 --> 01:06:53,001
You mean with me?

1194
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:55,956
The way I am?

1195
01:06:56,855 --> 01:06:58,534
With what you
see and...

1196
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:01,235
how I talk?

1197
01:07:01,945 --> 01:07:03,125
I love you.

1198
01:07:06,698 --> 01:07:08,319
You don't see no
difference?

1199
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:10,535
No difference
that matters.

1200
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,405
Imagine that.

1201
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:17,517
I could've
had all this.

1202
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:18,872
Been all this.

1203
01:07:20,354 --> 01:07:23,402
People calling me 'Your Honor'
and smiling at me.

1204
01:07:24,296 --> 01:07:26,403
Kids making a fuss
over me and...

1205
01:07:27,273 --> 01:07:30,196
me not having to hide
from someone all the time.

1206
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,246
And you.

1207
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:35,310
I could've had you.

1208
01:07:35,524 --> 01:07:38,238
But you are all that.
You have me.

1209
01:07:40,203 --> 01:07:41,203
I ain't.

1210
01:07:41,549 --> 01:07:43,030
I got nothing.

1211
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,344
I ain't got...
even got myself.

1212
01:07:48,048 --> 01:07:51,200
Don't say those things.
As least not out here.

1213
01:07:51,548 --> 01:07:56,235
You promised today would be our day. You promised to
forget all about the court and the election, and everything.

1214
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,184
Please, darling.

1215
01:08:02,664 --> 01:08:04,749
Let's just
enjoy ourselves.

1216
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:17,483
I beg pardon, sir, but perhaps
you'd prefer to come back tomorrow.

1217
01:08:17,615 --> 01:08:20,111
Evidently, His Honor
is unavoidably detained.

1218
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:21,569
I'll wait.

1219
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:23,003
Yes sir.

1220
01:08:38,688 --> 01:08:39,972
You happy, darling?

1221
01:08:40,019 --> 01:08:40,761
Yeah.

1222
01:08:41,344 --> 01:08:42,636
I'm scared, too.

1223
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:43,726
Of what?

1224
01:08:43,726 --> 01:08:44,620
I don't know.

1225
01:08:45,474 --> 01:08:47,708
I've never been scared
of nothin' all my life.

1226
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:50,566
Doctor Higgins said
you might—

1227
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:52,448
Ah, it nothin' the
doctor knows about.

1228
01:08:52,915 --> 01:08:55,228
Something I can't
figure out myself.

1229
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:59,963
Except maybe... it's because I found
something I never had before.

1230
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,927
Something... I want
to hold on to.

1231
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,113
Place like this.

1232
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:08,256
Feeling of quiet
inside me.

1233
01:09:09,713 --> 01:09:11,737
A new slant
on things.

1234
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:17,599
Ya, I'm talking
screwy.

1235
01:09:17,599 --> 01:09:18,391
No, you're not.

1236
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,231
It makes me so happy
to hear you talk like that.

1237
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:22,531
Happy?

1238
01:09:23,597 --> 01:09:25,857
Fred, I'm beginning
to find you again.

1239
01:09:38,795 --> 01:09:39,951
Honey, I'm...

1240
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:42,030
I'm all mixed up.

1241
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:50,859
You see, I...

1242
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,181
I made a deal.

1243
01:09:54,299 --> 01:09:57,408
But how could I've known that
I'll meet up with a girl like you?

1244
01:10:01,992 --> 01:10:04,267
Rather cut my arm
off than hurt you.

1245
01:10:18,254 --> 01:10:20,454
I could puzzle
it out.

1246
01:10:21,322 --> 01:10:22,935
Just for a couple
of minutes.

1247
01:10:23,497 --> 01:10:24,728
Myself.

1248
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:26,753
It's alright,
darling.

1249
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:19,209
That was a very,
touching scene.

1250
01:11:19,866 --> 01:11:22,678
What are you gum-shoein'
around for?

1251
01:11:23,102 --> 01:11:24,826
I have some nice
news for you.

1252
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:29,925
Remember I promised that if you help me
get Judge Parker, I'd help you get Smiley?

1253
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:30,787
Uh-huh.

1254
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:34,050
Well, I happen to keep my word,
even though some others don't.

1255
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,956
I did everything
you asked me.

1256
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:37,945
And bungled
everything, too.

1257
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:41,040
Instead of ruining Judge Parker,
you made him more popular.

1258
01:11:41,394 --> 01:11:43,125
That fight
in the auditorium.

1259
01:11:43,242 --> 01:11:46,472
Refusing the bribe in the Bentley case.
And now this...

1260
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:49,315
fantastic billing
and cooing.

1261
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:51,475
A guy can change,
can't he?

1262
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:52,885
Oh not you,
Eddie.

1263
01:11:53,973 --> 01:11:55,498
It's too late
for that.

1264
01:11:56,207 --> 01:11:59,043
Sorry, the 'halo' isn't
your particular dish.

1265
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,922
However, what I came
to tell you is this.

1266
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:05,620
Smiley is in town.

1267
01:12:08,773 --> 01:12:10,025
What's he doing here?

1268
01:12:10,549 --> 01:12:12,963
He's come to extend
his cafe business.

1269
01:12:13,325 --> 01:12:15,300
He's gonna open up
in this city.

1270
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:17,394
With your money,
Eddie.

1271
01:12:17,549 --> 01:12:19,465
The money you went
to jail for.

1272
01:12:20,154 --> 01:12:22,102
The money
he killed you for.

1273
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,315
I don't know.

1274
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:42,049
Getting the rat don't seem
important no more.

1275
01:12:43,646 --> 01:12:46,385
Oh no really, Eddie.
You're going soft.

1276
01:12:46,618 --> 01:12:48,350
What's more,
you're getting yellow.

1277
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:51,060
Don't you never
say that to me.

1278
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,271
Then prove I'm wrong by carrying out
your end of the bargain.

1279
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:55,579
Well I...

1280
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,252
I...can't leave Rosie.

1281
01:12:59,623 --> 01:13:00,547
I mean...

1282
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,018
Barbara.

1283
01:13:03,534 --> 01:13:06,708
Smiley in town is not only
a threat to you, but to...

1284
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,504
Barbara, too.

1285
01:13:10,202 --> 01:13:11,359
You mean...

1286
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:16,901
You mean the girl is in danger
with Smiley here?

1287
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:18,354
Figure it out
yourself.

1288
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:22,527
When he sees you, if you
don't get him, he'll get you.

1289
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:24,462
Like he did
before.

1290
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:26,923
With a smile
on his face.

1291
01:13:28,411 --> 01:13:31,016
- You know what that would
mean to Judge Parker.

1292
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:32,774
- To his body.

1293
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,379
- And where would
that leave Barbara?

1294
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:36,922
So you see...

1295
01:13:37,629 --> 01:13:40,976
Either way...
for her sake...

1296
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:44,925
for sake of any little
children she may have.

1297
01:13:45,569 --> 01:13:47,173
You got to kill him.

1298
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:50,414
He got a way of putting things
which makes sense.

1299
01:13:50,798 --> 01:13:52,795
Although inside me
I know that...

1300
01:13:53,226 --> 01:13:56,116
I shouldn't follow your advice,
but it's like you're saying

1301
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:00,420
it would only doin'
Barbara a favor.

1302
01:14:02,216 --> 01:14:04,931
Protecting...
her kids...

1303
01:14:07,466 --> 01:14:09,378
Our kids, maybe.

1304
01:14:09,515 --> 01:14:10,547
Uh-huh.

1305
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:13,232
Now you're beginning
to see straight.

1306
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,938
And think clearly.

1307
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:18,412
Should we go?

1308
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,970
I gotta
tell Barbara first.

1309
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:29,649
Honey, I...

1310
01:14:30,438 --> 01:14:33,182
I gotta attend to something.
Something very important.

1311
01:14:33,697 --> 01:14:35,061
Gotta use your car.

1312
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,507
My car?

1313
01:14:40,413 --> 01:14:43,495
Well, I guess it's alright, dear.
If you want to.

1314
01:14:44,252 --> 01:14:45,390
Thanks.

1315
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:48,956
I won't be long.

1316
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,871
Look, honey.

1317
01:14:56,032 --> 01:14:58,065
I want you to straighten
me out on something.

1318
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,586
I'll try dear,
if I can.

1319
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:01,451
If we was already married,

1320
01:15:01,559 --> 01:15:03,350
and living in this house, and

1321
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,757
had kids...

1322
01:15:05,666 --> 01:15:09,761
and one day a big rat full of poison came
out of his hole, and showed his teeth,

1323
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:12,116
and went for
the kids' throats,

1324
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:13,405
what would you do?

1325
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:16,394
They'd be nothing
to do but destroy it.

1326
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:19,138
You mean kill it,
don't you?

1327
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:23,136
Yes.

1328
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:25,258
Thanks.

1329
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:28,154
Thanks for
straightening me out.

1330
01:15:37,138 --> 01:15:38,594
But wait!

1331
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:45,821
Kill...

1332
01:15:47,152 --> 01:15:48,560
Kill...

1333
01:16:01,364 --> 01:16:02,958
What a beautiful day.

1334
01:16:04,558 --> 01:16:07,392
I couldn't ask for a more
delightful weather.

1335
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,546
Take that grin off
of your face.

1336
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:15,712
Now please permit me the privilege of expressing
my happy frame of mind with a...

1337
01:16:15,749 --> 01:16:17,716
few facial wrinkles.

1338
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:19,751
Relieves the tension.

1339
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:22,625
Look out I don't put
some wrinkles on you.

1340
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,655
It'll stay
for keeps.

1341
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:26,679
(police siren)

1342
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:40,841
What's the matter?

1343
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,500
I wasn't speeding.

1344
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,962
I didn't say
you was.

1345
01:16:44,053 --> 01:16:45,600
Let me see your
driver's license.

1346
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:52,535
Hah, must've left it
in my other suit.

1347
01:16:52,725 --> 01:16:54,473
In this state,
that ain't good.

1348
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,293
How about your
owner's licence?

1349
01:16:57,365 --> 01:16:59,492
Tell him it's your
fiance's car.

1350
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:03,565
Tell me you borrowed it to go to a campaign
meeting where you're making a speech.

1351
01:17:03,682 --> 01:17:05,278
Can't you recognize me?

1352
01:17:05,447 --> 01:17:08,485
I'm Judge Parker. I'm running
for governor in the next state.

1353
01:17:08,485 --> 01:17:10,703
There's a political shindig
there tonight and...

1354
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,170
I'm making
a speech.

1355
01:17:12,303 --> 01:17:14,530
This is my
fiance's car.

1356
01:17:14,655 --> 01:17:16,444
She just let me have
it for the emergency.

1357
01:17:16,617 --> 01:17:17,560
What's her name?

1358
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,059
Barbara Foster.

1359
01:17:19,527 --> 01:17:22,156
That's an interesting
set of circumstances.

1360
01:17:22,326 --> 01:17:25,678
A girl by that name phoned the police
and reported her car stolen.

1361
01:17:25,824 --> 01:17:30,822
And the description of the car and the license
number was identical with the one you're driving.

1362
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:34,520
I'm telling you you're
making a mistake.

1363
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:36,126
That's what
they all say.

1364
01:17:36,182 --> 01:17:38,621
Any how you're going to be explaining it
down at the station-house? Follow me.

1365
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:39,836
Follow me.

1366
01:17:53,112 --> 01:17:57,144
You know this should convince you,
conclusively, that I'm the only friend you have.

1367
01:17:57,185 --> 01:18:00,181
First your best pal Smiley
double-crosses you, and now this girl.

1368
01:18:00,181 --> 01:18:03,136
It ain't so. The cop pulled a boner.
The girlie had nothing to do with it.

1369
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:05,545
Wishful thinking, Eddie.
She knew you were out to kill,

1370
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:09,206
which meant you wouldn't be governor,
and she wanted to be the governor's wife.

1371
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:10,436
You're a liar.

1372
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:16,601
Mankind has been beset by women since Adam and
Barbara is true offshot of her grandmother Eve.

1373
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:17,401
You're batty.

1374
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:20,645
Will you at least come to see that
I'm the only person you can trust?

1375
01:18:20,669 --> 01:18:22,669
No further than I could
throw this building.

1376
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:24,211
Stop talking to me,
will ya?

1377
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:25,927
You're making a fire
burn in my head!

1378
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:27,717
- Now listen–
- Stop, I tell you!

1379
01:18:28,832 --> 01:18:30,205
Hey, what's with you?

1380
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,470
Who are you talking to?

1381
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:34,853
Nobody, I...

1382
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:37,593
just rehearsing
my speech.

1383
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:41,333
Yeah, well, come in the other room.
That lady is here... the owner of the car.

1384
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:45,366
Barbara!

1385
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:47,835
Barbara, tell this copper
who I am.

1386
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:49,386
I beg your
pardon?

1387
01:18:51,619 --> 01:18:52,827
What's this?

1388
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:54,523
Do you know
this man?

1389
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:57,704
I've never seen him
before in my life.

1390
01:19:04,987 --> 01:19:06,398
Barbara, please.

1391
01:19:07,474 --> 01:19:08,773
Don't do this to me.

1392
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:11,445
You have to file
a complaint, lady.

1393
01:19:12,301 --> 01:19:13,446
- Alright.
-Barbara, wait.

1394
01:19:13,446 --> 01:19:14,877
Let me talk
to you.

1395
01:19:15,082 --> 01:19:17,120
Alone, just for
a few minutes.

1396
01:19:17,768 --> 01:19:19,420
This may mean
everything to you.

1397
01:19:20,387 --> 01:19:22,283
To... To your future.

1398
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,149
Please.

1399
01:19:31,743 --> 01:19:32,708
Barbara.

1400
01:19:34,379 --> 01:19:36,033
There's certain things
I can't tell you.

1401
01:19:36,203 --> 01:19:38,148
Because I know
you won't believe it.

1402
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,693
But you gotta
believe this.

1403
01:19:42,348 --> 01:19:45,907
For the first time I can remember,
I'm trying to do something for somebody else.

1404
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:48,084
Without caring
what happens to me.

1405
01:19:49,055 --> 01:19:51,044
I was beginning to change,
you understand?

1406
01:19:51,826 --> 01:19:52,737
I done it.

1407
01:19:53,771 --> 01:19:55,094
Don't spoil it now.

1408
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,025
Don't let me down.

1409
01:19:59,282 --> 01:20:00,671
For your own sake.

1410
01:20:02,575 --> 01:20:04,277
For sake
of them kids...

1411
01:20:05,678 --> 01:20:09,464
which is gonna sleep in that nursery
you were telling me about.

1412
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,517
Fred, you said something
about making a deal.

1413
01:20:17,851 --> 01:20:18,689
Alright.

1414
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:20,766
I want you to make
a deal with me.

1415
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:22,671
I'll get you
out of here...

1416
01:20:23,116 --> 01:20:24,926
if you go with me
to a minister...

1417
01:20:25,483 --> 01:20:26,487
...and marry me.

1418
01:20:26,782 --> 01:20:27,806
Right now.

1419
01:20:28,743 --> 01:20:30,535
But I can't, I...

1420
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:31,804
Take it up, Eddie.

1421
01:20:32,012 --> 01:20:34,471
And you can finish
what you started out to do.

1422
01:20:36,744 --> 01:20:37,728
Alright.

1423
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:41,023
I'll marry you.

1424
01:20:55,614 --> 01:20:57,478
- Hey, Nick. You're going
the wrong direction.

1425
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:58,935
I'm going in the
right direction.

1426
01:20:59,210 --> 01:21:01,466
Never mind, dear.

1427
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,710
And He said
in another place,

1428
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:15,619
"If anyone offend one of the weak
who believe in Me,"

1429
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:17,429
"it better for him—"
(knock on door)

1430
01:21:25,649 --> 01:21:27,227
Where did I leave off,
my given?

1431
01:21:27,527 --> 01:21:28,618
"It were better."

1432
01:21:28,661 --> 01:21:29,726
For what were better?

1433
01:21:29,992 --> 01:21:31,159
"If anyone offends."

1434
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:32,439
"If anyone offends"

1435
01:21:32,591 --> 01:21:34,958
"one of the weak
who believe in Me,"

1436
01:21:35,106 --> 01:21:36,433
"it were better—"

1437
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:37,849
- Well...?

1438
01:21:38,614 --> 01:21:39,996
We want
to get married.

1439
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:41,963
- Why?

1440
01:21:45,646 --> 01:21:49,050
Too many people are getting married,
these days, without asking themselves why.

1441
01:21:49,623 --> 01:21:50,866
Well, there's
an idea.

1442
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:52,637
Make a note
of that for sermon.

1443
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:54,050
Yes, dear.

1444
01:21:54,437 --> 01:21:56,507
My husband
is preparing his sermon.

1445
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:57,759
He'll be right with you.

1446
01:21:57,823 --> 01:21:58,837
Won't you sit down?

1447
01:21:58,901 --> 01:22:01,398
"And one of the weak
who'll believe in Me..."

1448
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:03,508
"What better for him,"

1449
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,242
"let a millstone
hang about his neck,"

1450
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:07,995
"and he will cast
into the sea."

1451
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:12,694
And he said in another place,
"If thy hand offend thee, cut it off."

1452
01:22:13,057 --> 01:22:16,553
"It is better for thee to enter life maimed,
than to go into the cahaina..."

1453
01:22:16,553 --> 01:22:18,373
"of an extinguishable fire."

1454
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:20,110
You said it,
brother.

1455
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:22,969
His expressions of approval
become confine to Amen.

1456
01:22:23,374 --> 01:22:24,374
Please.

1457
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:29,617
For it is written that everyone
shall be burned with fire

1458
01:22:29,673 --> 01:22:32,308
and every bit
of salt with salt.

1459
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:35,130
And the Devil speaks to you,
my children, heed him not,

1460
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:39,040
for his only desire to lead
you below, he's the evil one.

1461
01:22:39,096 --> 01:22:40,360
Watch for him.

1462
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,886
No matter what name
he introduces himself with,

1463
01:22:42,886 --> 01:22:45,964
Lucifer, views of our
Mephistopheles.

1464
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,060
Hey.

1465
01:22:49,087 --> 01:22:50,534
I know him.

1466
01:22:52,248 --> 01:22:53,340
- Where was I?

1467
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,783
- Mephistopheles.
 - Oh, yes.

1468
01:22:54,793 --> 01:22:57,299
Heed not Mephistopheles,
my children...

1469
01:22:57,343 --> 01:22:59,824
lest you suffer
eternal damnation.

1470
01:22:59,868 --> 01:23:02,025
When he whispers
in your ear,

1471
01:23:02,073 --> 01:23:07,144
you turn away your head, and hearken instead
to the angel on your shoulder.

1472
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,420
What if he ain't got
no angel on his shoulder?

1473
01:23:11,465 --> 01:23:13,580
You have
if you live right, son.

1474
01:23:13,644 --> 01:23:15,555
Be good, do good.

1475
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:19,034
- The devil wields no power
over a good man.

1476
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:24,954
Sit tight, honey,
I'm coming right back.

1477
01:23:25,008 --> 01:23:26,111
Where you going?

1478
01:23:26,512 --> 01:23:28,441
I'm gonna tell off
the devil.

1479
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:30,695
- Good for you, son.

1480
01:23:30,992 --> 01:23:33,353
The alter is to your left
as you enter the church.

1481
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:39,492
Well, Eddie.

1482
01:23:40,335 --> 01:23:42,257
I just came out
to tell you something.

1483
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:45,457
There's a smart operator,
in there.

1484
01:23:45,769 --> 01:23:47,684
what knows
all the answers.

1485
01:23:47,684 --> 01:23:49,357
- You don't say.
- Mm-hmm.

1486
01:23:50,813 --> 01:23:52,316
He even knows
who you are.

1487
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:54,465
Do you know?

1488
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:56,846
Yeah, Nick.

1489
01:23:57,745 --> 01:23:58,674
I know.

1490
01:23:59,383 --> 01:24:02,972
I'm afraid I'll have to take you
back, Eddie. You know too much.

1491
01:24:04,276 --> 01:24:08,344
The dope I got says you can't
get the drop on a good man.

1492
01:24:08,552 --> 01:24:10,275
That hardly
covers you.

1493
01:24:10,643 --> 01:24:13,356
My record's clean
in this trip.

1494
01:24:14,886 --> 01:24:18,143
I ain't done nothing wrong
since you brought me back.

1495
01:24:21,172 --> 01:24:24,137
Oh Eddie, I only have the
kindliest feelings towards you.

1496
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:28,518
And to prove it, I want you to go
right back in there, and marry Barbara,

1497
01:24:28,622 --> 01:24:31,437
and my blessings
on both of you.

1498
01:24:31,918 --> 01:24:35,283
We don't want no
blessings from you.

1499
01:24:36,032 --> 01:24:37,721
I'm through
with you.

1500
01:24:42,964 --> 01:24:44,321
Beezlebub.

1501
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:55,073
And therefore is not by any
to be entered to lightly.

1502
01:24:55,272 --> 01:24:56,538
but reverently.

1503
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,642
Discreetly. Advisably.

1504
01:24:58,803 --> 01:24:59,840
Soberly.

1505
01:24:59,906 --> 01:25:01,648
And in the
fear of God.

1506
01:25:02,494 --> 01:25:06,129
Under this holy estate, these two
persons come now to be joined.

1507
01:25:07,104 --> 01:25:09,367
If any man can
show just cause,

1508
01:25:09,703 --> 01:25:12,395
why they may not
lawfully be joined together,

1509
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,037
let him
now speak,

1510
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:17,442
or else hereafter,
forever hold his peace.

1511
01:25:18,122 --> 01:25:19,844
I require and
charge you both—

1512
01:25:19,844 --> 01:25:20,844
Wait a minute.

1513
01:25:21,585 --> 01:25:22,647
Please, dear.

1514
01:25:22,801 --> 01:25:24,722
He brought up
something important.

1515
01:25:26,206 --> 01:25:29,111
Honey, I gotta speak now,
like he says.

1516
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,581
I can't marry you.

1517
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:34,828
I'd be doing wrong.

1518
01:25:36,255 --> 01:25:39,174
And that's just what
the devil is waiting for.

1519
01:25:39,174 --> 01:25:40,841
Oh dear, Lord.

1520
01:25:42,795 --> 01:25:46,398
Fred, you don't know how hard
I've been trying to help you in every way.

1521
01:25:46,672 --> 01:25:48,578
But I'm afraid I can't
go much further.

1522
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:51,352
You're not only destroying
yourself, you're destroying me.

1523
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,376
And I just can't
stand it any longer.

1524
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,818
Please, let's go on
with the ceremony.

1525
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,164
But honey, I can't.

1526
01:25:58,213 --> 01:25:59,645
My eyes have
been opened.

1527
01:25:59,885 --> 01:26:01,994
Marrying you now would
be the worst thing I could do.

1528
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:08,448
Which don't mean that you lost Fred Parker, but like
you said this afternoon, you'd be finding him again.

1529
01:26:09,786 --> 01:26:11,461
And you'll be
proud of it.

1530
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:14,395
Like you
always was.

1531
01:26:18,634 --> 01:26:20,659
Honey, if I can only
make you understand.

1532
01:26:38,512 --> 01:26:41,107
I think I do
understand, darling.

1533
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:44,762
Come,
I'll drive you home.

1534
01:26:51,556 --> 01:26:52,801
Please forgive us.

1535
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,720
Eddie.

1536
01:27:06,451 --> 01:27:07,684
You have
a visitor.

1537
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,820
You might like to know
that in his breast pocket,

1538
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:18,196
he's carrying the very gun
with which he snuffed you out.

1539
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:21,275
He's been carrying it
around, ever since.

1540
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:23,415
Brings him luck,
he says.

1541
01:27:24,127 --> 01:27:28,030
You can now repay that long
overdue debt with your own gun.

1542
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:31,639
That's what's known
as poetic justice.

1543
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:02,723
"Heed not Mephistopheles,
my children..."

1544
01:28:02,723 --> 01:28:05,621
"lest you suffer
eternal damnation."

1545
01:28:05,762 --> 01:28:07,849
"When he whispers
in your ear,"

1546
01:28:08,109 --> 01:28:09,854
"turn away
your head."

1547
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:12,064
"and hearken instead,

1548
01:28:12,064 --> 01:28:14,647
to the angel
on your shoulder.

1549
01:28:32,925 --> 01:28:34,570
You're right,
Mephistopheles...

1550
01:28:35,471 --> 01:28:37,364
or Nick,
for short.

1551
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,692
But I ain't never plugged
no guy what's asleep.

1552
01:28:42,683 --> 01:28:44,384
I'll wake him first.

1553
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,721
It's so much simpler
this way.

1554
01:28:46,912 --> 01:28:49,510
I made him drowsy
to make it easier for you.

1555
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,995
You make everything
easy, don't you?

1556
01:28:53,807 --> 01:28:54,826
Alright.

1557
01:28:55,407 --> 01:28:57,980
Have it your way.
Wake him up.

1558
01:28:58,265 --> 01:28:59,969
It might be
more amusing.

1559
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,420
I'll go fix him
a drink.

1560
01:29:04,482 --> 01:29:06,653
Make it feel
like old times.

1561
01:29:17,444 --> 01:29:18,444
Smiley.

1562
01:29:20,818 --> 01:29:21,818
Smiley!

1563
01:29:22,119 --> 01:29:23,411
Oh, who called me?

1564
01:29:23,798 --> 01:29:24,798
- I did.

1565
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:26,367
Oh.

1566
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:28,195
Judge Parker.

1567
01:29:30,082 --> 01:29:32,023
I'm fixing
a couple of drinks.

1568
01:29:33,712 --> 01:29:34,827
What's on your mind?

1569
01:29:35,556 --> 01:29:39,275
Well, I'm operating in
St. Louis and other spots.

1570
01:29:39,275 --> 01:29:40,275
Uh huh.

1571
01:29:40,906 --> 01:29:43,906
And I'm interested in a couple
of joints here, in the East.

1572
01:29:44,907 --> 01:29:47,729
Bellamy steered me to you
about getting a passport.

1573
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,369
Sure, sure.

1574
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:51,164
I understand.

1575
01:29:51,747 --> 01:29:55,167
So, as is my nature to
come to the point pronto,

1576
01:29:56,562 --> 01:29:57,805
what's your cut?

1577
01:29:58,251 --> 01:30:01,461
A hundred grand
and 25% of the take.

1578
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:05,190
Hold on, Judge.

1579
01:30:05,568 --> 01:30:08,703
I may be from St. Louis,
but I ain't no hick.

1580
01:30:11,432 --> 01:30:12,991
You operating alone?

1581
01:30:13,518 --> 01:30:14,696
No partner?

1582
01:30:15,213 --> 01:30:16,308
All alone.

1583
01:30:17,794 --> 01:30:21,401
I heard there was a Eddie Kagle
heading in your outfit.

1584
01:30:21,401 --> 01:30:22,721
Ya, but he's dead.

1585
01:30:23,339 --> 01:30:24,259
Are you sure?

1586
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:26,482
Well, I ought to know,
'cause I, uh...

1587
01:30:26,482 --> 01:30:28,174
- 'Cause you what?

1588
01:30:28,571 --> 01:30:31,091
I got the flash as soon as
the cops found his body.

1589
01:30:32,514 --> 01:30:34,107
I heard he was
your pal.

1590
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:37,155
Yeah, we grew up
together.

1591
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:40,695
I used to do his thinking,
and he do my fight.

1592
01:30:41,449 --> 01:30:45,513
So you paid him off by puttin' four
slugs in him from his own rod.

1593
01:30:47,353 --> 01:30:48,793
What kind of talk is that?

1594
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:51,428
You have
to blackmail?

1595
01:30:52,646 --> 01:30:54,943
This is Smiley Williams
you're talking to.

1596
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:56,707
Who should know...

1597
01:30:59,127 --> 01:31:00,408
better than me?

1598
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:05,031
You.

1599
01:31:05,908 --> 01:31:06,569
You—

1600
01:31:06,569 --> 01:31:08,247
Why are you
so nervous?

1601
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:11,053
You look like you've
seen a ghost.

1602
01:31:11,415 --> 01:31:12,971
Stop it Eddie,
get on with it.

1603
01:31:12,971 --> 01:31:14,918
Shut up,
Mephistopheles.

1604
01:31:16,736 --> 01:31:18,153
My name is
Smiley Williams.

1605
01:31:19,133 --> 01:31:20,501
Pleased to meet you.

1606
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:23,411
They call me
Judge Parker.

1607
01:31:24,507 --> 01:31:26,707
- But maybe I ain't
Judge Parker.

1608
01:31:28,224 --> 01:31:30,066
Maybe I'm somebody else.

1609
01:31:31,176 --> 01:31:32,971
Somebody you know.

1610
01:31:34,258 --> 01:31:35,146
No.

1611
01:31:35,876 --> 01:31:38,401
- No! You can't
be him.

1612
01:31:39,219 --> 01:31:40,219
Him?

1613
01:31:40,934 --> 01:31:41,965
Who's him?

1614
01:31:42,598 --> 01:31:44,657
Eddie! Eddie Kagle!

1615
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:48,175
Oh, you can't be. This whole
thing, it-it's screwy.

1616
01:31:48,175 --> 01:31:49,502
Maybe it ain't screwy.

1617
01:31:49,656 --> 01:31:51,584
Why don't you start
figuring it out?

1618
01:31:51,884 --> 01:31:54,532
If I ain't Judge Parker,
I must be somebody else.

1619
01:31:54,638 --> 01:31:58,813
Maybe I'm that pal of yours, Eddie. Eddie Kagle,
the one you chopped down with his own rod.

1620
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:03,090
Figure it when you're afraid of every
shadow, every footstep, every sound,

1621
01:32:03,090 --> 01:32:04,913
every dark alley
you pass,

1622
01:32:04,932 --> 01:32:07,225
every car that
whizzes by.

1623
01:32:07,423 --> 01:32:10,184
Hole up in your hideout
and go slowly nuts.

1624
01:32:10,374 --> 01:32:13,210
And trying to figure,
is Eddie Kagle dead...

1625
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:14,759
or is he alive?

1626
01:32:15,253 --> 01:32:17,669
And then when you
can't take it no more,

1627
01:32:18,389 --> 01:32:20,264
go blow your
brains out.

1628
01:32:23,632 --> 01:32:25,677
There it is...
your own gun.

1629
01:32:25,677 --> 01:32:27,384
Return the compliment,
Eddie.

1630
01:32:28,147 --> 01:32:30,675
Stop whispering
in my ear, devil.

1631
01:32:31,392 --> 01:32:33,242
Lay off of me,
will you, Judge?

1632
01:32:33,624 --> 01:32:35,133
I'll do anything
you say.

1633
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:40,229
Eddie!

1634
01:32:41,178 --> 01:32:42,178
Eddie!

1635
01:32:42,969 --> 01:32:44,274
Give me
a chance!

1636
01:32:45,298 --> 01:32:47,298
- Ahhhh...

1637
01:32:50,844 --> 01:32:52,460
You didn't
shoot him.

1638
01:32:52,788 --> 01:32:53,988
We had
a bargain.

1639
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:56,899
He was took care of
a better way.

1640
01:32:58,005 --> 01:32:59,760
And I never even
touched him.

1641
01:33:01,063 --> 01:33:03,049
Now you go back to your
hole in the ground.

1642
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:05,276
You're in my way.

1643
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,718
I cannot go back
without you.

1644
01:33:07,795 --> 01:33:09,712
Well, now, ain't
that too bad.

1645
01:33:10,053 --> 01:33:11,153
Listen, Eddie.

1646
01:33:12,073 --> 01:33:14,639
No soul has ever escaped my domain before.

1647
01:33:14,663 --> 01:33:17,585
I've got to get you back or
I'll be jeered at and derided.

1648
01:33:18,141 --> 01:33:21,193
Why the upheaval would be
cataclysmic in its proportions.

1649
01:33:21,248 --> 01:33:22,780
What a laugh.

1650
01:33:23,986 --> 01:33:26,227
Looks like you got yourself
behind the eight ball.

1651
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:27,956
Come on, Eddie.
Please.

1652
01:33:28,226 --> 01:33:29,326
Have a heart.

1653
01:33:29,781 --> 01:33:31,710
You'll have to take
it up with the Boss.

1654
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:34,394
I'm getting my orders
from Him...

1655
01:33:34,816 --> 01:33:36,240
from now on.

1656
01:33:41,285 --> 01:33:43,763
Must I run afoul
of you again?

1657
01:33:45,224 --> 01:33:47,799
Am I doomed forever
to be vanquished?

1658
01:33:48,512 --> 01:33:53,662
What has this sub-human creature,
incubated in the recesses of foulness,

1659
01:33:53,686 --> 01:33:55,483
done to become
your favorite?

1660
01:33:56,558 --> 01:33:59,410
It was with evil intent
that he ventured forth.

1661
01:33:59,877 --> 01:34:01,818
He volunteered
to do my bidding.

1662
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:04,805
Must I be humiliated
by this maggot?

1663
01:34:05,733 --> 01:34:07,074
I demand my rights.

1664
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:09,299
You're missing
the point, chum.

1665
01:34:10,638 --> 01:34:12,791
There's an hombre
called Judge Parker.

1666
01:34:13,024 --> 01:34:17,103
And a sweet girl named Barbara what's
been playing good ball with a lot of kids,

1667
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:20,695
which might otherwise
join up with your team.

1668
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:25,727
And me, Eddie Kagle, is staying around
to see that you don't mess things up.

1669
01:34:29,152 --> 01:34:33,095
So long as you remain in the judge's body,
neither you nor he can do anything.

1670
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:36,117
What's more, you're making
Barbara very unhappy.

1671
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:38,700
The longer you
remain on earth,

1672
01:34:39,275 --> 01:34:42,344
the longer she cannot be joined
with her rightful mate.

1673
01:34:42,733 --> 01:34:44,452
It was you
who got me in.

1674
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,788
You were evil, then.
I had power over you.

1675
01:34:50,834 --> 01:34:51,993
I get it.

1676
01:34:59,056 --> 01:35:02,001
If I don't myself help you
take me out of Parker's body...

1677
01:35:02,927 --> 01:35:06,468
Barbara and the Judge don't
get together like they should.

1678
01:35:11,743 --> 01:35:13,191
Alright I'll make
you a deal.

1679
01:35:14,556 --> 01:35:17,587
If you lay off the Judge
and Barbara for life,

1680
01:35:18,766 --> 01:35:19,966
I'll go back
with you.

1681
01:35:22,798 --> 01:35:25,028
I accept.
I have to.

1682
01:35:25,488 --> 01:35:26,513
You ready?

1683
01:35:29,864 --> 01:35:30,864
Wait, I...

1684
01:35:31,572 --> 01:35:33,785
I want to say goodbye
to Barbara first.

1685
01:35:33,809 --> 01:35:34,809
I cannot wait.

1686
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,185
You'll wait
and like it.

1687
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:46,324
Hello?

1688
01:35:47,043 --> 01:35:48,043
Barbara?

1689
01:35:48,836 --> 01:35:50,267
I gotta see you
right away.

1690
01:35:51,754 --> 01:35:53,586
Hop in your car
and come right over.

1691
01:35:55,304 --> 01:35:56,304
Yeah.

1692
01:35:58,233 --> 01:35:59,433
Thanks, honey.

1693
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:21,536
You sure are somethin' for
the eyes in that outfit, honey.

1694
01:36:21,919 --> 01:36:22,922
Thank you, darling.

1695
01:36:23,258 --> 01:36:24,663
I want to look my best.

1696
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:26,881
You said we'd go to
dinner and a show.

1697
01:36:27,539 --> 01:36:28,539
Um...

1698
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,139
I'm afraid,
that's off.

1699
01:36:31,842 --> 01:36:32,842
'Cause...

1700
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:36,395
'Cause I—
I'm going away.

1701
01:36:38,015 --> 01:36:39,593
I ain't never
coming back.

1702
01:36:40,516 --> 01:36:42,065
Dearest, what
do you mean?

1703
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:43,833
Why would you
be going away?

1704
01:36:43,857 --> 01:36:46,325
Well, I can't
tell ya 'cause...

1705
01:36:46,746 --> 01:36:48,755
I'm afraid you won't
understand, baby.

1706
01:36:49,812 --> 01:36:52,262
I only understand that wherever
you go, I wanna go with you.

1707
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:53,462
Nix.

1708
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:56,450
You don't belong
where I'm going.

1709
01:36:57,026 --> 01:36:58,903
Oh no, Darling.

1710
01:37:01,525 --> 01:37:02,525
Eddie?

1711
01:37:06,064 --> 01:37:09,796
I got everything set for you, honey.
So you won't have no more trouble.

1712
01:37:10,717 --> 01:37:12,019
When I'm gone,

1713
01:37:13,031 --> 01:37:15,513
the Judge can straighten
everything out and...

1714
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,415
you and him
get married.

1715
01:37:20,118 --> 01:37:22,415
And go live in
that swell house.

1716
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:26,586
And have kids.

1717
01:37:27,855 --> 01:37:29,041
- Eddie.

1718
01:37:32,692 --> 01:37:34,514
I have to be going
now, honey.

1719
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:38,601
Please, please don't.
Please don't.

1720
01:37:40,443 --> 01:37:41,276
Darling,

1721
01:37:41,849 --> 01:37:43,241
I feel kinda funny.

1722
01:37:44,129 --> 01:37:45,351
Kinda dizzy.

1723
01:37:45,646 --> 01:37:47,575
Darling, go and lie down
for a minute.

1724
01:37:47,575 --> 01:37:49,586
Yeah, yeah.
I'll lie down.

1725
01:37:53,311 --> 01:37:55,744
I just want
to tell you—

1726
01:37:55,744 --> 01:37:56,744
- Eddie.

1727
01:38:25,802 --> 01:38:26,895
Bye, honey.

1728
01:39:26,915 --> 01:39:28,231
Doctor Higgins, please.

1729
01:39:29,955 --> 01:39:31,277
Do you know
where he is?

1730
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:36,562
Please try to reach him and tell him to come
to Judge Parker's apartment immediately.

1731
01:39:37,376 --> 01:39:38,476
It's very urgent.

1732
01:39:39,321 --> 01:39:40,321
Thank you.

1733
01:39:43,935 --> 01:39:45,035
- Barbara.

1734
01:39:46,404 --> 01:39:47,504
- Barbara!

1735
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:57,294
[Judge]  There's
tears in your eyes.

1736
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,955
[Judge]
What's the matter?

1737
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,344
[Barbara]
It's nothing.

1738
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:04,079
[Barbara]  It's nothing.
 Everything's fine now.

1739
01:40:09,515 --> 01:40:10,515
Well...

1740
01:40:11,626 --> 01:40:12,762
So long.

1741
01:40:17,505 --> 01:40:18,505
Funny.

1742
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:22,217
I never thought people's
faces looked so good.

1743
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:26,299
There's lots of other things
I never noticed before.

1744
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:31,197
If I'd only known the first trip
around what I know now.

1745
01:40:31,197 --> 01:40:34,787
When I get you down below,
I'm going to take special pains with you.

1746
01:40:34,787 --> 01:40:37,719
I'm going to introduce you
to agonies undreamed of.

1747
01:40:37,719 --> 01:40:40,251
I don't think
you'll be so tough.

1748
01:40:40,355 --> 01:40:41,791
- No?
-Nah.

1749
01:40:42,318 --> 01:40:43,654
'Cause you
