   The most improbable event
   of the 20th century

5
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,460
occurred in Havana, Cuba.

6
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,795
The revolutionary victors
   marched in

7
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,264
and the national complexion
  changed completely.

8
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,035
They had been liberated.

9
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,605
The survivors of the old regime
escaped as best they could.

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,608
Taking with them only
      a few meager effects

11
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:54,446
such as the Cuban treasure
  and other art objects.

12
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:57,316
It wasn't always easy to
  smuggle a loot out of Cuba

13
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,353
and so secret meetings were
being held all over the island.

14
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,624
This story of robbery,
   double-cross, and murder

15
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,327
begins with
     just such a meeting.

I am. Who are you?

Never mind who I am,
   it's the mission that counts.

Let's get on with it.

22
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:45,931
As an American gambler
          and gangster

you're above suspicion.

00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,702
Of course you know that our
government has been overthrown.

00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,838
- You know, I heard that.
   - Shut up.

               We'll be back.

But of course in order to
    finance a great revolution..

31
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,256
...it has been necessary
        for us to, uh

32
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,925
steal the Cuban treasure.

You're going

so you will
         be leaving Cuba anyway.

You have a big yacht and you can
leave any time you wish.

Such as immediately.

40

Therefore I'm going to entrust
  you a solemn trust.

in the lobby of the Waldorf
Astoria, new year's eve, 1934.

112
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,638
In 1940, he was involved in an

to nominate Benito Mussolini
 for the Republican ticket.

by the navy, marines
     and the SS.

gave her a Rolls Royce
    every Christmas

into the Hollywood Bowl
    with a tommy gun

   Humphrey Bogart pictures.

   committed after his sister

Mary-Belle talked Renzo into
 giving him a job.

Up until that time, Happy Jack
had been a tennis bum.

and mooching nickels
     in the BMT subway.

he's become a well known dice

Famed Wardville bird mimic.

146
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,498
Pete Jr. inherited his father's
talent for animal imitations

147
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,268
but unfortunately, blew
     his brain out of whack

148
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,536
while imitating
        a whooping crane

149
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:08,573
at the Elks convention picnic
 in Osh Kosh in 1942.

150
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:12,277
Since then, anyone's been able
 to convince Pete of anything.

151
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,512
Renzo found him struggling
  along as a pickpocket

152
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:18,516
at Jones Beach and took him
  with him in his exile.

153
00:10:18,552 --> 00:10:21,319
Since then, he's been
   Renzo's faithful servant.

Shining his shoes
 and rubbing out his enemies.

00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,258
In return, Renzo permits him
 to imitate any animal

156
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,860
that comes into his head.

[animal cry]

158
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,568
That, for instance,
      was the mating call

159
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,269
of a Himalayan yak.

160
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,641
There they are, my shipmates.

161
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,676
I didn't know where
    they were taking those

162
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,212
unsuspecting Cubans,
 but I knew they were taking.

163
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,348
And so with grim faces,
    we set our helm

164
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,217
against their perilous future.

165
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,885
[singing]

166
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:04,763
Okay, now before I begin,
  has anyone anything to say?

167
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,231
Pete.

168
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,632
[mooing]

169
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,670
How about you, Jack?
What do you think we should do?

170
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,738
- Give up?
       - Oh, now, honey.

171
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,374
Is that any way for
   Mary-Belle's big man to talk?

172
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,412
Now, look, we've got to get rid
of at least half of these Cubans

173
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,514
without making the rest
    of them suspicious.

174
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,921
There used to be
               a Cuban fisherman

175
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,389
by the name of Hemmingway.

176
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:36,194
He got hooked on a sea monster..

177
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,396
...in these waters
     a couple of years ago.

178
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,900
And he was dragged for miles.
 Got a lot of publicity.

179
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,303
We're gonna show these boys
  the greatest sea monster

180
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,305
they ever saw in their lives.

181
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,842
'Jack, in my trunk,
  there are some garden rakes'

182
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,777
'used for weeding tomatoes.'

183
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,613
'You get them. and,
and sharpen them like scalpels.'

184
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,518
Pete, you mix up a mess
   of olive oil and green ink

185
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,188
'and snag some seaweed
     from over the side.'

186
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,591
And, Jack,
          what are you gonna do?

187
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,160
- Sharpen up the garden rakes.
 - Good boy.

188
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,230
Pete, how about you?

189
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,499
[barking]

190
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,168
Does he have to do that?

191
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,636
Alright, Jack, beat it.

192
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,312
[singing]

193
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,495
We've had a good life together,
haven't we, baby?

194
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,333
Um, you know it, boops.

195
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,335
Winters in Tijuana.

196
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,970
Summers in Cicero.

197
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:57,408
Remember that wonderful trip
    we took to Monte Carlo?

198
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,445
You mean the time we heisted
all those $100 chips?

199
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,580
Sure.

200
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:06,284
(Sparks)
I'll admit I couldn't really
hear anything through that door

201
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,853
but I was sure
   they were up to no good.

202
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,556
I knew it was up to me
    to stop them.

203
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:17,462
Now we are off again
            to parts unknown.

204
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,798
It's like a second honeymoon.

205
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,167
You know something?

206
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,235
We ought to get married.

207
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:27,172
Now, don't be a drag, baby.

208
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:30,775
[chuckles]
      How much jack do you think
      is in that strongbox?

209
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,379
I don't know. There's plenty
of Cuban sugar though.

210
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,681
What are we gonna do
            with all of it?

211
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,286
I don't know.

212
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:47,892
I always wanted to open up
a home for the aged hoodlums.

213
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:51,863
Baby, you got a heart
      as big as all our dollars.

214
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,568
[instrumental music]

215
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,443
(Sparks)
  Our government agent lives
  in constant peril.

216
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,179
I devised my undetectable
   radio set

217
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,849
using simulated hotdogs
    for knobs..

218
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,351
...and tubes
    inside of dill pickles

219
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,453
while watching
   a number of sewer workmen

220
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,755
during lunch hour.

221
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,925
It comes in mighty handy,
   believe you me.

222
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:24,362
One little slip and I could be
 headed for Davy Jones' locker.

223
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,701
Hello, Havana.
      This is Agent XK150.

224
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,206
I'm making my first
      official report.

225
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:38,309
So far, not too much
      has happened.

226
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,245
But I'm anticipating.

227
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,248
Friends of Capetto and his gang
are on board as suspected.

228
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,916
I am with them.

229
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,919
I will call you again
    soon one of these days.

230
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,355
This is Agent XK150

Gee, that looks good.

Great.

00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,845

"Good mornin'

you gorgeous,
beautiful creature."

242
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:56,254
Would you ask the general to
remove himself from my presence?

00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,457

...golden angel flower singin'.

247
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:22,780
Would you tell the general that
I feel that he'd be most at home

       over a hock spit.

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,231
You must be a glutton

Oh, now, what do you want?

254
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,679
You're too good for this life.

255
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,417
You're young and you're
 innocent. You should get out.

Are you unwell?

The gettin' is great.

259
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,827
You're a victim of circumstance.

260
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,797
I try. I do try.

261
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
You're a crazy mixed-up kid.

262
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,170
I'm perfectly adjusted
     to my life of crime.

263
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,905
Now, what is your story?

264
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,474
Oh, well, you see,
I'm beyond help, but you're not.

265
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,244
You could find a clean,
    young man to marry and..

266
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,845
I haven't got the time.

00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:31,182
But I can help you, Mary-Belle.

You can turn blue.

Don't worry, Mary-Belle.
    I'll save ya...or die.

270
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,859
That's a comforting alternative.

271
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,370
(Sparks)
      A secret agent
      should never sleep.

But there I was,
 dreaming of mom's apple pie.

273
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,210
While up on deck, Renzo
and his cut-throats were taking

274
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,812
their first step.

275
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,880
Killing an innocent Cuban.

276
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,450
And pretending
 some imaginary monster did it

277
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08,486
just so they would be panicked
into changing course.

278
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,156
So that Renzo could steer them
 to his own picked destination.

Pete, wait one minute.
     Then give the alarm.

283
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,387
(Sparks)
   But what none of us knew

284
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,590
was that the monster
     invented by Renzo

285
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,393
had already been invented
   by somebody else.

286
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,396
By a couple of other monsters,
I guess.

What did he say?

295
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,912
The general says,
                "What happened?"

296
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,715
Now, in my stated opinion,
  those soldiers were attacked

297
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,585
by some weird creature
     from the sea.

298

       It is a monster."

we put the box in the skiff

00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,807
Pete, I want you to
       search the island.

464
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,542
See if anybody lives here.

465
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:42,546
Jack, you take one of
the life boats and rode ashore.

466
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,115
Go to San Juan
   and rent us a fishing boat

467
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:46,750
and plenty of diving gear.

00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,691
Oh, Colonel.

471
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,828
You see if you can get your men
to build us a Lean-To

472
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,830
or something
     to keep the rain off.

476
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,796
Could stay here forever.

477
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,332
That won't be necessary, baby.

478
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,734
Why?

479
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,703
Well, the way
I've figured, these Cubans

480
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,805
aren't very much at diving.

481
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,409
But Jack, Pete and I are all
 pretty good spear fisherman.

482
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:48,178
We'll go down,
find the strongbox

483
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,714
and hide it in the hole
in the reef.

484
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,617
After that we'll tell
the Cubans that it's no use.

485
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,819
Give up.

486
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,655
It'll be safe there
for months.

487
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,492
Even years. Until we're ready
to come back and get it.

00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,461
You like it?

Pete, aren't you gonna
   introduce me to the lady?

Isn't she beautiful, Renzo?

        they're in love.

It's a wedding ring.

Aloha.

About 20 bottles, ten regulars,

519
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:45,622
Overdid it as usual.

Well, okay, we're gonna
start diving this afternoon.

I brought something else

[speaking in foreign language]

    to meet Renzo Capetto

524
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:02,672
my sister Mary-Belle,
    Mr. Pete Peterson and..

525
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,475
Well, I don't know who
  the large woman with him is.

526
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:06,610
Rosina Perez.

527
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,145
Hi.

528
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,813
Hello, everybody.

529
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,349
You found this woman
            in San Juan?

530
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,752
She was livin' in a sorority
  house down by the docks.

531
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:18,321
She's awful friendly.

532
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,357
Why don't you come
over with me, honey.

533
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,626
I'll show you
our sorority house.

534
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,498
Senor Capetto. I have the honor
to report that my men

535
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,133
will be ready in one hour.

536
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31,301
Ready for what?

537
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:34,171
To dive
               to the strongbox.

538
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,772
You mean,
your men are divers?

539
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:39,643
Yes. They're Cuban army
         front men.

540
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,344
Ole!

541
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:47,384
I have a situation
      well in hand.

542
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,153
Mary-Belle was weakening
  as I'm sure you've noticed.

543
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:52,589
Then she came into my life.

544
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:55,459
I didn't see her coming, but
 somehow I sensed her presence

545
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:59,696
and knew that my life
      was changed forever.

Sparks Moran.

550
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,343
As a trained espionage agent,
 I could tell

551
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,811
that she was attracted to me.

552
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:18,748
But I wanted Mary-Belle.
 And Mary-Belle wanted Renzo.

553
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,852
And Renzo wanted to go.

00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,391
Just keep this thing firm.

         - Oh, yeah.

00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:35,398
Alright, we're ready.
    Where's the Cuban army?

559
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,902
I don't know.
                  But I'm ready.

The search for
   the strongbox had begun.

571
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,757
But the sea was
    cladded up with Cubans.

572
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:12,429
Dispersed by General Tostada
 to search independently.

573
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,098
All those Cubans,
       alone in the deep.

574
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,768
This was a chance for Renzo to
 again become the sea monster.

575
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:27,377
A lonely Cuban had found one of
 the many wrecks on the bottom.

576
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,418
And Renzo had
    found the lonely Cuban.

Their attack was
       cleanly executed.

00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:12,789
The victim was dead.
    The killers delighted.

00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,758
But not satisfied.

581
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,794
Renzo must have another
    quart of Latin blood.

582
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:26,269
We waited.
  Sensing the dangers below.

    sought new prey.

     Was this shark?

00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,369
- No, it was a monster.
 - What do you mean a monster?

589
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,104
A real, live,
   honest to goodness monster

with claws and everything.

Oh, you're nuts.
       The way they say.

592
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,810
Carmelita, it's too
    dangerous for you here.

593
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,812
Let's run away
       and live a little.

00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,447
No, I'm in love
with Sparks.

- Sparks Moran?
        - Si.

596
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,384
How can you be in love with him?
He's an idiot.

597
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,187
- You should love me.
     - No. I'm in love with him.

598
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,723
And I don't care
if I never see you again.

599
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,827
If I had only paid my
     life insurance premium

600
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,161
I'd kill myself.

601

Oh! No, no, no!

- Don't kill yourself.
     - Why not?

No, you come with me.
           I'll show you.

00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,302
Come with me to the jungle.

You've seen one jungle,
you've seen them all.

You come with me,
           you see and you like.

Hello, colonel.

Senor, I'm very much afraid
  of this monster.

609
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,713
Well, then, just
      pick up and go home.

No! I am an officer.

We will not stop
  until we have the strongbox.

From now on we'll dive

00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,920
I was telling her what that
  Carmelita do to you.

621
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,956
I was telling her
        to cheer you up.

622
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,825
Oh, gee, thanks, Rosina.

623
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,693
But it really
wasn't necessary.

624
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,829
Oh. Do you not like Mango?

625
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:08,364
Oh, yeah.
I like her.

[speaking in foreign language]

627
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,309
She must speak
            good English, senor.

628
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:22,545
Oh, I don't think
that's gonna matter at all.

629
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:25,648
Okay. I'm going back now.

630
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:30,220
Mr. Pete Peterson Jr.
       He is waiting for me now.

631
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:33,223
- Adios, Rosina.
       - Adios.

[intense music]

636
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:20,770
- Are you alright, Rosina?
  - Oh, I'm alright, my hero.

637
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,640
Hey. Where's Happy Jack?

638
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:26,743
Oh, come on.
I take you to them.

639
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:27,911

             - Yes.

Oh, I don't know
           what you said, Mango.

642
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,657
But it sure was wonderful.

643
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,625
[speaking in foreign language]

644
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,533
I feel the same way, Mango.

645
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,704
Why, I never felt like this
     in my whole life before.

[speaking in foreign language]

              I know.

648
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:11,254
Why, here come
                Pete and Rosina.

[speaking in foreign language]

650
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:19,662
Hi, Jack. Who's your friend?

651
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,898
Oh, this is Mango Perez.
    Rosina's daughter.

652
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,601
Gee, she is almost
    as pretty as her mother.

653
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:25,702
Yeah, she is wonderful.

654
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:28,204
Yeah, but can't she do
     imitation?

655
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,440
Well, I don't know.
             And I don't care.

656
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,674
'Cause I love her.

657
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,678
- Gosh! You're gonna marry her?
- Yeah, well, why not?

658
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:40,316
Why not? If you marry Mango
  and I marry Rosina.

659
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:43,753
I'll be your father.

660
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,855
What kind of a
         call was that?

661
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,558
Oh, we cannot talk here.
    We cannot talk.

662
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,426
My monsieur..

663
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,795
He make big trouble.

664
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,298
Yeah. I just had
       a fight with him.

665
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,200
You know, Pete.

666
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,670
I'm getting tired
  of all this runnin' around.

667
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:03,306
You know what
                 I'd like to do?

668
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,843
I'd like to marry Mango
         and settle down here.

669
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,212
Why, I could start
              a tennis club.

670
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,214
They don't have clubs.

671
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,116
They have rackets.

672
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,718
Say, why don't we
rub the mole out?

673
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:18,421
And this way, we can keep
the strongbox for ourselves.

674
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:21,724
Oh, yes. Even Marry-Belle?

675
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,594
Well, gee,
I don't know about her.

676
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,296
Well, she is my sister.

677
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,766
'We could keep her around
       to do the housekeepin'.

678
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:30,800
Sure?

679
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,602
And she will get over
           losing Renzo.

680
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:34,137
- Sure.
      - Is it a deal?

681
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,907
Besides, they've been cheatin'
 on their income tax, anyway.

[speaking in foreign language]

Mango, she want go swimming.

684
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,214
- Alright.
          - Let's go.

685
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,419
Sparks, where's Pete
      and the boys?

686
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:51,888
They know we should be
     diving this afternoon.

687
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:53,923
I think they're
    somewhere in the jungle.

[speaking in foreign language]

689
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,563
What's this?
             Well, what is this?

690
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,833
This man's wife is playin'
   around with Mr. Pete.

691
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,468
He is very angry.

692
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,670
That's tough.

693
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:11,240
[speaking in foreign language]

694
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:16,479
This man wants to sell you his
wife for $50 and a case of rum.

695
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,347
Tell him he's nuts.

[speaking in foreign language]

697
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,489
Carmelita, will you talk to him?
We're busy.

698
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:31,894
Oh, sure. I would tell him to
 cut down to 20 and gin.

699
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:33,896
Gin nothing.

700
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:37,533
Who wants to buy
      his improbable wife?

701
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:40,236
Come on, Gen. Tostada.
     Let's get going.

[speaking in foreign language]

703
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:05,094
Alright, baby.

704
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,462
Listen, you hold on to these.

705
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:09,499
I can't use them without
    Pete or Jack to help me.

706
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:11,601
I'll keep 'em warm for you.

 Renzo Capetto had
 at last found the strongbox.

712

    had found Renzo Capetto.

Mango?

Mango?

Mango?

723
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,877
Please find my daughter.
    Please.

724
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:18,487
Mango?
             Mango?

725
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,427
Mango?

726
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,263
Mango?

727
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,835
Why'd you have to do it, Renzo?

728
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,338
- Why'd I have to do what?
   - Don't play games.

729
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:36,539
Why'd you kill her?

730
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:39,608
- I swear, I had nothing to do--
- I said don't play games.

731
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:43,612
We all saw the...the same five
 incisions and the ground marks

732
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,214
in that stupid coral plunger.

733
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:46,382
Ask Marry-Belle.

734
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,484
I gave her the rakes
      before I went under.

735
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,253
That won't play. You had
 two more in your trunk.

736
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,588
Just in case,
you said, remember?

737
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:55,891
Yeah, I remember,
    but they're still there.

738
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,594
I can't convince him.
     Honey, maybe you can.

739
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,696
Sorry, honey. But I'm afraid
  I'm gonna have to

740
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:02,531
go along with Jack.

741
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,300
You think I did it?

742
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,469
Well, what else
                 can I think?

743
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,504
You made that monster
           out of thin air.

744
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,539
Now don't try to
              tell me it's real.

745
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:11,507
I'm not that stupid.

746
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:14,276
Well, I am. I always
      believed in it.

747
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:15,644
But it's gotta be real.

748
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,647
Either that or the Cubans
   are tryin' to kill us all.

749
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:21,283
- I can't buy that.
  - I don't care what you buy.

750
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,319
From now on
  we're gonna dive with spears

751
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,587
like the rest of them.

752
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:27,656
We've got to get rid of those
 Cubans as quickly as possible.

753
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,526
Now, we'll start
 tomorrow morning with Tostada.

754
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,796
Jack?

755
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,698
Pete.

(Sparks)
Possible death notwithstanding,
the courageous general

758
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:03,793
and two of his men dove once
 more into the deadly sea.

759
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:07,496
But as usual,
     they were not alone.

760
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:09,665
Renzo waited
     for them to separate.

761

[music continues]

762
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,946
One pulled away
   and then there were two.

763
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,228
Tostada went out alone
   into the forbidding void.

764
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,864
With the killers closing in.

765
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,786
The giant observer
      stood watching

766
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,188
over a pathetic bit of cloth.

767
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:08,858
All that remained of Mango.

768
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:14,830
At last, Tostada had found his
 gold in his own watery grave.

[indistinct]

771
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,402
The general died
    as old general should.

772
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:55,771
His greedy murderers
    let his body drift away

773
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:58,240
while they
   congratulate each other.

774
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,448
Happy Jack found
      a scrap of a dress

775
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:09,351
and knew what had happened
  to his beloved.

776
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:10,819
Suddenly.

777
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,691
[music intensifies]

778
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,173
- Don't touch me.
       - Oh, honey.

779
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,475
Go ahead, try to
    talk yourself out of it.

780
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:35,277
Tryin' to talk yourself
    cool this time.

781
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,246
- Baby.
  - Tell me the Cubans did it.

782
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:38,647
Only they were onboard.

783
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:40,649
Now, who was
     down there with Jack?

784
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:41,717
No, baby.
You gotta believe--

785
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:44,186
I don't want to
              look at you again.

786
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:52,494
Oh, Renz.
                       O-oh!

787
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,530
Marry-Belle,
I saw what he did to you.

788
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,899
They told your brother and now
you've gotta leave, Marry-Belle

789
00:53:56,934 --> 00:53:59,401
and there's no one
to help you, but me.

790
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:01,704
Oh, Marry-Belle, I love you
so much, I could split.

791
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,372
Just get on..

792
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,212
What do you do to my man?

793
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:11,847
Oh, shut up!

794
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,421
I'll save you.

795
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,861
(Sparks)
         It was dusk.

796
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:28,797
I could tell, because
    the sun was going down.

797
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:36,472
You were right, senor.

798
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:38,907
All my army is finished.

799
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:41,710
I knew when the general died.

800
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:45,547
I don't care about the box.
Let the monster keep it.

801
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:49,184
I don't want him
to kill anymore of my men.

802
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,353
Neither do I, colonel.

803
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:54,556
Think we must go to
Ciudad Trujillo in the morning?

804
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:56,425
You can go anywhere you like.

805
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,593
I am going home.

806
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,862
To America?

807
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:02,498
America?

808
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:06,869
No. I can't go back
             there anymore.

809
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:07,870
Sicily.

810
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,772
Oh.

811
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:12,574
I've got an uncle there who's
   been after me for years

812
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,343
to help him stamp grapes.

813
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,814
It's beginning
                to appeal to me.

814
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:23,686
Mary-Belle hates me.

815
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,621
I know.

816
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,624
But I love you.

817
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:32,895
It's kind of nice
       having somebody love you.

818
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,764
Why don't you
try to love me?

819
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,400
You might like it.

820
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:40,869
I guess I can try.

821
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:44,273
(Sparks)
   She pressed her hot,
   Latin lips against mine.

822
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,575
And I forgot everything
    but Carmelita.

823
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,678
But our silent partner was
  not going to let me forget.

824
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:52,548
This was it.

825
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,616
There was but one thing
     a responsible, trusted

826
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,652
representative
of the United States Government

827
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,454
could do at a time like this.

828
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:01,156
Get out of there.

829
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,558
Mary-Belle.

830
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,592
Yes.

831
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:05,694
I..

832
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,397
I just like one more
chance to explain.

833
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:09,698
'Please?'

834
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,535
It's alright, boopsie.

835
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:15,471
(Mary-Belle)
    'Doesn't really matter.'

836
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,507
No matter where you go
     or what you do or..

837
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,276
...whom you kill..

838
00:56:21,312 --> 00:56:24,546
...I'll love you
      till the day I die.

Renzo loved Mary-Belle,
     but he was the skipper

847
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:23,472
and decided to go down
    ahead of the ship.

Carmelita, I've never known
     a girl like you.

854
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:33,275
You ever spend your whole life
in a months time?

855
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,677
Carmelita, I love you
           and I wanna marry you

856
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,513
and take you away
               from all this.

857
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,615
Hmm, that I would like it,
I think.

858
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:42,818
Of course we'd have to live
on the salary of an American spy

859
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,786
which is $41.50 a week.

860
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:45,687
I don't care.

861
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:48,557
You're so strong,
so intelligent.

862
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:51,193
You see, how you solve
the whole case.

863
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:54,363
You're the smartest
torpedo in the whole world.

864
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:56,665
I'm not really as smart
         as I look, Carmelita.

865
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,767
You see, I-I have
               to admit that..

866
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,537
...all that time I thought
      Renzo and the Cubans

867
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:03,672
were trying to steal that
       strongbox.

868
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,674
But I was wrong.

869
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:08,176
The real killer was the monster.

870
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,378
So what?

871
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:10,746
You are beautiful.

872
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,583
So I got the girl.

873
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:17,819
And guess who got the gold?
