3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,832
- Thank heavens you've come, li po.

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,500
Lia is here already.

5
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,083
Don't be afraid, little one.

6
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,457
You're old enough to understand daddy.

7
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,374
You're in great danger here

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,416
and I am sending you to
the great Dr. Fu manchu

9
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:41,291
because he's our friend and very powerful.

10
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,625
- No, no, daddy!

11
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:45,207
I'm frightened!

12
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,874
- Oh, don't be afraid, little one.

13
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,957
No one will harm you in his house.

14
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:49,958
- My master say

15
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:52,541
you his friend, come too.

16
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,957
- No.

17
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,791
My place is here with my people.

18
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,500
We can't hold out very much longer.

19
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:03,624
But tell Dr. Fu that
no matter what happens,

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:07,292
I shall bless him for
saving my little girl.

21
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:07,125
- Go with wai yi, my son.

22
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,957
Honorable scholar husband,

23
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,292
may this inferior one speak?

24
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,666
What do you wish, my golden Jewel?

25
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,582
- Oh, honorable lord,

26
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,624
the crowds are growing dangerous.

27
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,957
- Do not fear, little flower.

28
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,582
They will not touch the house of fu.

29
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,707
Why, even the coolies in the street know

30
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,042
that I am dedicating my life to mankind.

31
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,874
Has li po returned with
Dr. Eltham's scion?

32
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,458
- Yes, exalted one.

33
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,457
But she's crazed with terror.

34
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,957
We cannot quiet her.

35
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,332
- Poor little bird.

36
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,083
Bring her here to me.

37
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,874
- Hush, little flower.

38
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,875
What?

39
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,625
Quiet, little flower.

40
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:10,667
Quiet.

41
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,332
Do not be concerned, fai lu.

42
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,749
Hypnotism is a very good
thing when used wisely.

43
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,500
The child will sleep.

44
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,957
- Master, the white devil
soldiers have come from the sea.

45
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,458
Their great fire sticks belch forth death.

46
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:39,792
There.

47
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,957
Keep watch at the gate and

48
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,666
bring me word of what happens.

49
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,333
- Master, I beg you,

50
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,917
awaken the child.

51
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,582
- You are quite right.

52
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,082
If anything should happen to me,

53
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,000
no one could waken her.

54
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,958
Waken, little blossom.

55
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,125
Waken.

56
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,332
Do not fear, little flower.

57
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,832
The white men are kind and generous

58
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,624
and they will not hurt our son,

59
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,708
nor harm the house of fu.

60
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,542
- Captain petrie!

61
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,542
- Well?

62
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:00,082
- The colonel thinks we've got them.

63
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:04,124
Observation reports snipers
on your right front.

64
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,957
- All right.

65
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,666
Tyler, see the house on the
right there with the garden?

66
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,583
500 yards, open sights,

67
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,707
two rounds gunfire.

68
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:17,708
- Yes, sir.

69
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,749
- Mela!

70
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,750
Mela!

71
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,542
Mela!

72
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,875
Gods of my ancestors,

73
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,917
I have been blind!

74
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,000
These whites are barbarians.

75
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,583
Devils!

76
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,333
Fiends!

77
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,917
They have slain my lotus blossom.

78
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,458
They have slain my little son!

79
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,458
Blood of my blood!

80
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,542
Hear me, great gods of my rage!

81
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,375
Hear me!

82
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:29,457
I swear by this emblem of the house of fu

83
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,457
that I shall wipe out the stains

84
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,499
with the lives of the foreign devils,

85
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,833
father and sons to the third generation!

86
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,542
Oh, no!

87
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:58,792
This...

88
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,291
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

89
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:06,125
This child shall be the
means of my vengeance!

90
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh!

91
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,541
- Oh, I'm frightfully sorry.

92
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,874
Did I hurt you?

93
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,624
- I'll be all right in a moment.

94
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,874
- What is it?

95
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,124
- I'm afraid it's my ankle.

96
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,499
- Please don't be frightened.

97
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,791
I may be rather a clumsy brute,

98
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,374
but I am also a doctor.

99
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:07,292
Won't you let me see if
I can help you, please?

100
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,457
- I'm afraid it's rather a bad sprain.

101
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,791
I'll call a cab and take you home.

102
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:18,708
- Oh, please!

103
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,875
Don't leave me here alone.

104
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,166
- Did I frighten you so?

105
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:26,167
Oh, no.

106
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,375
It's the fog.

107
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:32,124
I'm afraid I don't know where I am.

108
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,125
I'm lost.

109
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,749
- Ah, well, now you're found.

110
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,166
Come, we'll find a cab together.

111
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,374
Oh, taxi!

112
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,166
Drive to 624 park Lane, please.

113
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,917
Where on earth were you going alone?

114
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:05,291
- That's just what I
was trying to remember.

115
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,958
Oh, I'm so confused.

116
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,749
I recall dimly looking for a certain house

117
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,416
in this neighborhood.

118
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,749
- In this neighborhood?

119
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,791
Well, possibly I could help you find it.

120
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,499
Was it on this street?

121
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,583
- I think so.

122
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,124
But still I'm not sure.

123
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,875
Oh, I'm all mixed up.

124
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,832
As though I'd been walking in my sleep.

125
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,666
Until I bumped into you and
then I seemed to wake up.

126
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,749
- That's strange.

127
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,833
Has that ever happened to you before?

128
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,167
- Yes.

129
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,291
Yes, several times.

130
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:44,041
Well, my guardian is a doctor

131
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,791
and he's done everything to cure me.

132
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,125
But it still goes on and on.

133
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,291
Oh, I wish I might stop it.

134
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,999
It frightens me so.

135
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,875
- There, there.

136
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,416
I'm sure something can be done about it.

137
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,124
- Oh, do you really think so?

138
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,749
- I know so.

139
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,791
Oh, here's my house.

140
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,374
If you don't mind, I'll go
in and get my medicine case

141
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,292
before I take you home.

142
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,833
- Wait.

143
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:21,500
Where are you going?

144
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
- Taxi!

145
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,375
Taxi!

146
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,332
Here's to grandfather on his birthday.

147
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,124
He may be 80 today,

148
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,666
but he can still down
a bottle, kiss a girl,

149
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,416
and be up at daybreak for the hunt.

150
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,057
- It will be the same when I'm a hundred.

151
00:15:53,083 --> 00:16:01,083
J' for he's a jolly good fellow j“

152
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,082
j' and so say all of us j'

153
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,083
- to father.

154
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,957
- You're on my foot!

155
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:10,833
- I beg your pardon?

156
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,999
- You're on my foot, sir!

157
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,124
- Oh, so I am, sir.

158
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,082
I am frightfully sorry.

159
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,791
- Sylvester, you ought
to get some eyeglasses.

160
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:20,416
- Oh, I'd rather not, sir.

161
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,832
I have been told they make
me look slightly effeminate.

162
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,832
- Well, what is your errand?

163
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,166
- Oh, sir, most extraordinary, sir.

164
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,832
After typing your letters,

165
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,374
I felt rather faint.

166
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,041
So I rang for a cup of custard.

167
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,582
Well, just as I was spooning up the stuff,

168
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,707
I suddenly became aware of a
veiled lady hovering over me.

169
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,624
Well, of course, it's not polite to go on

170
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,791
spooning up custard with veiled
ladies hovering over you.

171
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:48,082
So I got up.

172
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,625
And she handed me this letter.

173
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,166
- Why, it's addressed to me.

174
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:52,958
- Yes, sir.

175
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,291
I stooped over to read the address.

176
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:58,166
When I looked up again, she was gone.

177
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,374
-Hmm.

178
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,625
Was she, er, tall or short?

179
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,291
- She had on a long, black cloak,

180
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,832
so she might have been tall.

181
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,207
Or else, er, a short
girl on stilts.

182
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,125
- You fool.

183
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,042
You fool.

184
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:14,875
She may have been the one

185
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,791
that you have been looking for, Jack.

186
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:17,957
- Not likely.

187
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,416
What did she bring you, grandfather?

188
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,958
- Well, let me see.

189
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,167
That's queer.

190
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:26,958
It's a Chinese dragon.

191
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,124
- Well, what's that red stain on it?

192
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,792
- Blessed if I know.

193
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:38,332
"Inspector nayland Smith, Scotland yard."

194
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,332
- Nayland Smith?

195
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,249
Why, I was up at Oxford with him.

196
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,417
Scotland yard?

197
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,750
Show him in.

198
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,875
- I say, I didn't know
that you knew him, dad.

199
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,707
Why, he's the greatest
criminologist alive.

200
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,541
- I place him now.

201
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,749
He specializes in murder mysteries.

202
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,374
- Exactly.

203
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,625
General petrie.

204
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:01,416
I'm sorry to intrude, gentlemen,

205
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,957
but I've something of the upmost
importance to communicate.

206
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,457
- Oh, certainly, inspector.

207
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,875
Come in, come in.

208
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,582
- Sir John petrie, I believe.

209
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
- Delighted to see you again, Smith.

210
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:15,166
My son, doctor petrie.

211
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,083
- How do you do?

212
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:17,207
- Delighted, inspector.

213
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:20,875
- And my secretary, Mr.
- Sylvester Wadsworth.

214
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
- Hiya.

215
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,582
- How do you do?

216
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,832
General, you will forgive me

217
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,291
if I come straight to the point.

218
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,457
I understand you saw service in China

219
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,791
during the boxer rebellion.

220
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,041
- Yes.

221
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:39,042
My son and I were at the
relief of the legations.

222
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,874
- In that case, I must warn you

223
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,957
that you are in the gravest danger.

224
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,957
- Oh, I say, that's strange.

225
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:52,917
I could have sworn that I locked
that window before dinner.

226
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,042
- That's queer.

227
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:04,625
Somebody's broken the glass
and unlocked the door.

228
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,666
Where'd you get that?

229
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,291
The dragon!

230
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,541
Turn out those lights!

231
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,291
Hurry, close these curtains.

232
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,875
Help me close them!

233
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,791
There, is everything closed?

234
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,499
Yes, everything's
quite closed, inspector.

235
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,832
Turn on the lights.

236
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,667
All right.

237
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,458
Turn on the lights.

238
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,292
Why doesn't somebody turn...

239
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,125
I am trying to,

240
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,041
but I can't find the confounded button!

241
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,875
- What is the meaning of all this?

242
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:34,916
- General, I came to warn
you of impending danger.

243
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,624
But I find it's already upon you.

244
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,875
- Oh, nonsense!

245
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:48,124
- Did you know a colonel
lasalle in the French army?

246
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,499
- Yes.

247
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,874
I met him at Peking.

248
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,874
Seems to me he died rather
suddenly some years ago.

249
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,207
- He did.

250
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,375
Very suddenly.

251
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,976
Did you know brigadier general Van hought?

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
- Yes.

253
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:05,416
That was the fellow who was
found dead in his garden.

254
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,541
- Both these men were in
the siege of the legations.

255
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,874
Both of them died under
mysterious circumstances.

256
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,291
In both cases, this
bloodstained dragon was received

257
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,792
just before death.

258
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,124
- I don't understand what you mean.

259
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,291
- I mean that for years somebody has been

260
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,582
systematically poisoning the officers

261
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,957
of the boxer rebellion.

262
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,541
First in Russia, then
Germany, then France.

263
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,291
And now this fiend has reached London

264
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:40,208
and Scotland yard has taken charge.

265
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:45,957
This dragon means that you're
marked for the next victim.

266
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,208
- Oh, nonsense!

267
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,207
Why, that's perfectly fantastic.

268
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,792
Oh, surely the inspector
cannot be serious.

269
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,624
Don't touch that!

270
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,458
Quickly, sir!

271
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,624
Don't breathe that stuff!

272
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,625
Don't breathe it!

273
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,500
I'll open the window.

274
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,333
Here.

275
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,666
Yes, and open the door.

276
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,250
- Clarkson are you there?

277
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,916
There's a man calling the garden wall.

278
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:18,833
After him!

279
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,833
Follow him!

280
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,750
How is he, doctor?

281
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,791
- Why, we're too late.

282
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,792
He's dead.

283
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,374
- If the rest of us had
got a full breath of that,

284
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,208
we should all be dead.

285
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,458
You see, gentlemen,

286
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,917
I am very serious.

287
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,625
- You have delivered the dragon?

288
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,166
- Even as you commanded, 0 master.

289
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,167
- Mm.

290
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,208
It is well.

291
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,958
Prepare her that I may
bring her out of her trance.

292
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:54,541
You have done my bidding?

293
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,708
- Yes, master.

294
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,833
The englishman is dead.

295
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:01,083
Aye!

296
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:40,208
Give me two more lives,
gods of my ancestors.

297
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,125
Only two more.

298
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:49,500
Let the accursed house of
petrie atone to the house of fu!

299
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,083
Please.

300
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,499
- Master, this contemptible one

301
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,917
was found by a police person.

302
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,042
- He waits in the street below.

303
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,250
- Quickly.

304
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,541
- Have you completed
the examination, doctor?

305
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:24,624
- Yes.

306
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,582
His heart failed.

307
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,791
If I hadn't been here at the time,

308
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,207
I would have sworn natural death.

309
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:33,041
- That's true of all the dragon murders.

310
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,416
Obvious methods are never used.

311
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,957
The crime is covered up by
appearing to be natural death.

312
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,416
I tell you, petrie,

313
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:44,124
we are dealing with a
diabolical genius of a madman.

314
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,082
- But have you no suspicion who it is?

315
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,832
- A suspicion, yes, but not a certainty.

316
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:53,082
When we are certain,

317
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,917
we'll spring our trap.

318
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,250
Like that.

319
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,792
Until then, you must leave London.

320
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,832
- Are you asking me to run away?

321
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:05,833
- Exactly.

322
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,916
The general wouldn't heed my warning,

323
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,666
but you must.

324
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:11,957
You're a marked man.

325
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:18,582
- Petrie residence?

326
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,416
Must talk to inspector Smith at once.

327
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:25,749
- Er, it's the chap you sent
after the man, inspector.

328
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,583
Yes?

329
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:27,417
Smith speaking.

330
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,749
- Clarkson reporting.

331
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,041
They got me.

332
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,042
I'm through.

333
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,792
Watch Singapore Charlie's.

334
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,750
- Clarkson!

335
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,291
Clarkson, where are you?

336
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,792
Good heavens.

337
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:50,958
Weymouth!

338
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:52,625
Here, inspector.

339
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,458
- Get my hat and coat.

340
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:54,541
Yes, sir.

341
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:55,500
- What's happened?

342
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,666
- Clarkson is dead.

343
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,499
Petrie, it's necessary
for me to go to limehouse

344
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,582
and follow a new clue.

345
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,832
And I must feel that you and your son

346
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,791
are safely out of London.

347
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,791
- Might I suggest your country place, sir?

348
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,916
We'll be perfectly safe at redmoat.

349
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,457
- Capital, capital.

350
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:10,874
I'll send a couple of my men to guard you.

351
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,957
- But look here, you know, Smith, I...

352
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:14,958
Oh, very well.

353
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,041
I'll go.

354
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,042
Goodbye, petrie.

355
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:17,875
Goodbye.

356
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:19,791
Be careful.

357
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:20,832
Goodbye, doctor.

358
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:21,833
- Wait.

359
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:24,291
I'm going along with you, inspector.

360
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,292
Hm?

361
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,457
I must warn you, doctor,

362
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,874
you are taking your life in your hands.

363
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,791
They've got your grandfather.

364
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,707
They'll try to get your father.

365
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,957
They'll try to get you.

366
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,874
- I'm in on this thing to the finish.

367
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:43,791
- We may need a doctor
before we're through.

368
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:45,624
- Goodbye, father.

369
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,249
Sylvester, you'll keep an eye on sir John

370
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,292
while I'm gone.

371
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,291
Of course.

372
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:52,291
- And remember, petrie,

373
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:53,625
take no chances.

374
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,291
You will never be out of danger

375
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:59,625
until we find this murderer.

376
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,957
- Don't be alarmed, sir John.

377
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,875
I shall stay with you every minute.

378
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,958
If you'll only stay with me.

379
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:19,458
-Hmm.

380
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,999
- You men mix with the crowd
around Singapore Charlie's.

381
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,374
If you hear a shot, raid the place.

382
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,041
Got your revolver, petrie?

383
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:54,082
- Right here.

384
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,124
- Righto.

385
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,666
Come on, weymouth.

386
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:15,250
J' for if I lived next door to you j'

387
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,541
Bet your lousy dough.

388
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,749
Oh, you will, will you?

389
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,208
- Hey, Charlie.

390
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,666
Charlie, give us three beers.

391
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,916
One for me, one for
Eric, one for Carl, eh?

392
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,875
- Oh, if I could indeed.

393
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,124
J“ if we never looked behind us j“

394
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:17,125
j“ we'll never see the
strange things that we see j“

395
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,374
- Close that door.

396
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,791
Looks like a blind alley.

397
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,749
- Quick, up here!

398
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,542
- Let's separate.

399
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:01,875
You go that way.

400
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:30,250
- Shh!

401
00:31:30,251 --> 00:31:31,833
Don't make a sound!

402
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:35,208
Put that down!

403
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:46,375
I say, I've seen you before.

404
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:49,832
Last night.

405
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:50,667
The fog!

406
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,124
Your ankle.

407
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:55,457
Why, you're the girl who disappeared.

408
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,874
- Yes.

409
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,457
And you're the doctor.

410
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:02,457
I say, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to frighten you.

411
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,791
- So you're not a doctor after all.

412
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,249
You're a burglar.

413
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,624
And you wanted to come home
with me that night to steal.

414
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,499
- Oh, now, listen,

415
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,041
you must listen.

416
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,708
- Oh, well, put that thing down.

417
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,917
Now I'll listen.

418
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,207
- I'm not a burglar, really I'm not.

419
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,291
I was in the gambling room
below and there was trouble.

420
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,374
I got mixed up in and

421
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,624
they chased me up here.

422
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,291
- So you're not a burglar,

423
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,624
you're a gambler.

424
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,292
Hush.

425
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,207
They're out there, they'll hear us.

426
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,374
- Well...

427
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,332
- One minute.

428
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,332
- What do you want?

429
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,041
- Oh, there's no one here.

430
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:20,292
Come and look for yourself.

431
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,374
- I say, that was wonderful of you.

432
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,916
You're saving my life.

433
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:45,917
- Perhaps.

434
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,457
I haven't quite made up my mind.

435
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,082
- I'd go at once if you wish.

436
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:53,583
- Oh, no, they might hurt you.

437
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,957
Oh, please, waitjust a little minute.

438
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,750
I'll show you a way that is safe.

439
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:11,082
- So you don't really think
I'm a burglar after all?

440
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,083
- No.

441
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:18,499
But you must tell me
what you're doing here.

442
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,041
- Well, I'm in trouble.

443
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,541
Well, I'm afraid I can't tell you

444
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,291
until you explain to me
why you're here yourself.

445
00:34:25,292 --> 00:34:26,875
- Why, I live here.

446
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,832
- Here in limehouse?

447
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,332
- Yes.

448
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,457
I suppose that does seem
a little strange to you.

449
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,291
But it's quite simple, really.

450
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,041
You see, my guardian,

451
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,624
who took me when I was a very little girl,

452
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,666
is a high-class Chinese.

453
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,749
He lives here in limehouse

454
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,416
so that he may be near the
people he can help most,

455
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:48,667
his own people.

456
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,749
My guardian is Dr. Fu manchu.

457
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,791
Not Dr. Fu manchu the
expert on oriental diseases.

458
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:56,625
Yes.

459
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,832
Oh, why, I know all about him.

460
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:03,124
The whole world knows about him.

461
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:06,958
He's the best and kindest
man that ever lived.

462
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:11,291
- I'm in trouble and I believe
that Dr. Fu could help me.

463
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:13,625
- Oh, oh, I'm sure he could.

464
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:20,166
He's always very glad to help everyone.

465
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,207
May I be of assistance?

466
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:28,291
Uncle fu, I want you to know doctor...

467
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,874
- Uh, petrie, Jack petrie.

468
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,041
- Mm.

469
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,416
- Dr. Petrie.

470
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:36,041
My revered guardian, Dr. Fu manchu.

471
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:37,916
- I am indeed very glad to know you, sir.

472
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,667
- Your presence honors our house.

473
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,541
- Uncle fu, Dr. Petrie was just telling me

474
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,624
that he's in some sort of trouble

475
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,082
and I told him you'd be
awfully glad to help him.

476
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,791
- Nothing would delight me more

477
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,792
than to be of service to Dr. Petrie.

478
00:35:56,083 --> 00:36:00,707
Why, I scarcely know
whether I should bother you.

479
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,207
- Oh, please.

480
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,499
Please tell him about it.

481
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,957
- Hush, little flower.

482
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,124
If the doctor feels he had
rather not trust me, why...

483
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,125
- Oh, no, of course not.

484
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,125
That is well.

485
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:17,458
Will you come into my study?

486
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,625
- Thank you again.

487
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:27,417
I'll say goodbye after
we've had our little talk.

488
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,083
Fai lu.

489
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,832
You've been listening.

490
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,833
- Mm-mm.

491
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:53,792
- Mm-mm?

492
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:00,166
Oh, did you see the marvelous englishman?

493
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,167
- Mm-hmm, yes.

494
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:06,292
Oh, fai lu, I want my green dress

495
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,041
and my gold slippers

496
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:10,499
and those Pearl-drops for my ears.

497
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,333
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:12,499
- Now, run quickly.

499
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,542
Oh!

500
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,458
- You, uh...

501
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,791
You are in trouble, Dr. Petrie.

502
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,624
- Yes, I am.

503
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:37,332
Tonight, my grandfather,
general petrie, was killed.

504
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,292
Murdered.

505
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:39,916
No!

506
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,917
General petrie murdered?

507
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:49,041
- Scotland yard is on the case and,

508
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:51,291
well, an oriental was suspected.

509
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,749
A clue led to the gambling room below.

510
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,416
The suspect was chased
through these corridors and

511
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,291
I became confused.

512
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,292
That accounts for my
presence in your ward's room.

513
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,832
- Your news shocks me.

514
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,332
- Thank you for your sympathy, doctor.

515
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,249
Later, I may ask your assistance,

516
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,041
but right at the present moment,

517
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:09,374
I think I'd better be trying to find

518
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,791
my friend, nayland Smith.

519
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:11,792
- Wait.

520
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,957
It would not be safe for you to leave now.

521
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,832
If you will sit down, I
will send one of my servants

522
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,957
to find your friend.

523
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,791
Er, nayland Smith?

524
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:23,957
- Oh, yes, yes, that's it.

525
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:24,792
That's very good of you.

526
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:25,625
Thank you, doctor.

527
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:26,625
- Not at all.

528
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I am delighted to serve, Dr. Petrie.

529
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:36,624
There is a stranger lost in the corridor.

530
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,499
You are to give orders
that he is to be found

531
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,707
and brought here.

532
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:44,957
And in the meantime, bring tea.

533
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,125
Er, guest tea.

534
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,666
- With your knowledge
of limehouse, doctor,

535
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,582
you'll be invaluable to us.

536
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,249
Yes.

537
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,082
My people are peculiar.

538
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,667
And, uh, only an oriental
understands them.

539
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,083
But I mean to act quickly,

540
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:12,875
before your Scotland
yard friends act rashly.

541
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:17,291
And I think I may safely
promise to bring you

542
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:22,292
face to face with the man who
murdered your grandfather.

543
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
- Thank you.

544
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,624
- An interesting relic.

545
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,125
From the tomb of genghis Khan.

546
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:50,167
Perhaps, er, you do not
know our Chinese ceremonials

547
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,000
of guest tea?

548
00:39:57,167 --> 00:40:00,041
It is the drink we serve our friends

549
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:02,458
just before they, er, depart.

550
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,417
- Mm.

551
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:09,292
Smith!

552
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,707
- Another moment and
you'd have been poisoned!

553
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,082
- But this is Dr. Fu manchu.

554
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,124
Yes!

555
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,832
The insidious Dr. Fu manchu.

556
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,582
The murderer we're looking for.

557
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,083
- How do you know?

558
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,791
- Look there.

559
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:34,791
The original bloodstained dragon.

560
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,333
- I congratulate you.

561
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,332
I did not think the honorable
inspector would search for me

562
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:45,291
in so obvious a place as limehouse.

563
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:46,916
- You forget, doctor,

564
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,291
I've learned your Chinese proverb.

565
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:52,292
If a wise man would hide from fools,

566
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,957
let him stay in his bed.

567
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,582
Being fools, they will credit him with

568
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,082
the most distant hiding places.

569
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,666
- Again, I congratulate you, inspector,

570
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:07,500
for having followed my
reasoning so perfectly.

571
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:10,541
- Oh, but Smith, surely
Dr. Fu manchu would never...

572
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:13,541
- I tell you, this maniac
has caused the death

573
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:14,707
of a score of men!

574
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,208
- 14, to be exact,

575
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,124
counting general petrie.

576
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,291
- You killed him?

577
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,125
No!

578
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,249
No!

579
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,291
Oh, they don't understand

580
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:28,166
because they don't know you.

581
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,416
Oh, can't you see?

582
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,999
Can't you see he's onlyjesting?

583
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
- Ijest?

584
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,832
First ask them if the white devils

585
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:40,374
who put the bloodstain there were jesting.

586
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,749
Ask them!

587
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,791
If not, I shall continue to kill

588
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:47,582
until the last stain is wiped out!

589
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,957
- Oh, no!

590
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:49,958
No!

591
00:41:49,959 --> 00:41:51,582
Oh, I can't believe it.

592
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,166
- Can you believe, little fool,

593
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,624
that I hate your detestable white skin?

594
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:58,042
Oh!

595
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,416
- Up with your hands, doctor.

596
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:03,417
- Hm.

597
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,083
Forgive my anger.

598
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,167
Forgive me, too, for
having underestimated you.

599
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,749
To be caught by the great nayland Smith

600
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,916
is almost a compliment.

601
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:20,541
- At least I've never
underestimated you, doctor.

602
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:21,542
But now,

603
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,207
you've killed your last man.

604
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,875
- Not quite my last.

605
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:30,457
I am counting on Dr. Petrie and his father

606
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,082
to complete my work here.

607
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,083
You!

608
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:40,750
- Keep your gun on him.

609
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,792
Your wrists, doctor.

610
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:57,374
- One question first.

611
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,624
What would you do if I told you

612
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:03,624
that your esteemed friend
was no longer behind you?

613
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:09,457
- Oh, I should say, "too
old a trick, doctor."

614
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,957
Help, Smith!

615
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:11,958
Help!

616
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,832
Sorry to disappoint you, Smith,

617
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,916
but perhaps we'll meet again.

618
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:39,250
I have many hiding places.

619
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,667
- Look!

620
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,832
Gone, too!

621
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,833
Trapdoor!

622
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,375
- We heard the shots, sir.

623
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:56,208
Have you got him?

624
00:43:56,209 --> 00:43:57,624
- Yes.

625
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:58,666
That's a blind door.

626
00:43:58,667 --> 00:43:59,500
Open it.

627
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,333
- Very good.

628
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,292
Give us a hand here, men.

629
00:44:01,293 --> 00:44:03,792
- There, you're all right now.

630
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,749
- Oh, I'm frightened, terribly frightened!

631
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,957
- Now, now, don't tremble like that.

632
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:10,457
I won't let him hurt you.

633
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,957
- Take me away from here.

634
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:13,041
Say you'll take me away.

635
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:14,582
- Of course we'll take you away.

636
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,082
Of course we will.

637
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,457
- Nothing on the other side
within a few rooms, sir.

638
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,957
- I was afraid of that.

639
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:21,124
- Here, Jones, search this
place from top to bottom.

640
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,624
Barker, put in a dragnet
around the entire district.

641
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:26,291
- Smith, we can't leave
her here like this.

642
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:27,208
I want to take her away some place

643
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,624
where she'll be safe from that fiend.

644
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,249
- Why worry about her, sir?

645
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,082
She's one of fu manchu's gang.

646
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,999
- Oh, no, I, tell you!

647
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,833
I'm not!

648
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:35,874
- Of course she's not.

649
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:36,875
Can't you see she had
nothing to do with it?

650
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,042
- Don't worry.

651
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,333
No harm will come to her.

652
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:45,167
Weymouth.

653
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:47,791
- Yes, sir?

654
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:49,957
- I think we'll take her
with us to headquarters

655
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,791
and guard her until morning.

656
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:54,332
And then she can go with us to redmoat.

657
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,666
- Redmoat?

658
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,207
Isn't that where you sent sir John, sir?

659
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,832
- Exactly.

660
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:03,833
And the girl will fit nicely
into a little plan I've formed.

661
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:15,708
-Hmm.

662
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:18,042
Here.

663
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:32,917
You will arrange this place
in accordance with my orders.

664
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,333
Ah, li po.

665
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:44,917
Well?

666
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,457
- They have taken the infidel girl

667
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,874
and her clothing to redmoat.

668
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,875
Red moat?

669
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,832
- Shall thy worm follow and kill?

670
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:57,833
- No.

671
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:00,792
I am well pleased.

672
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:06,042
Better for them they had
a cobra in their midst

673
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,917
than that girl.

674
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:17,874
- Here, Mr. Smith, is the detailed report

675
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,624
on Dr. Fu manchu.

676
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,666
- I thank your excellency.

677
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:23,916
What a tragedy that such a brilliant man

678
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:25,874
should be criminally insane.

679
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,541
- We were shocked by the facts, Mr. Smith.

680
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:32,582
But his intelligence makes
his menace the greater

681
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:35,666
and we as Chinese officials
are only too anxious

682
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,416
that he should be brought to justice.

683
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:40,291
- I thank your excellency
for your cooperation.

684
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:44,458
- I hope that you will
count upon it at all times.

685
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,167
- Quiet, Phyllis.

686
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,666
Who named that unfortunate
dog Phyllis, anyway?

687
00:47:58,667 --> 00:47:59,667
- I did.

688
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:04,582
- She looks rather like
an old aunt of mine.

689
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:07,417
- Well, what is she, a bloodhound?

690
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,917
- My aunt, a bloodhound?

691
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,250
- No, the dog!

692
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:19,082
Oh, the dog.

693
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:21,749
Oh, well, well, she is
a bloodhound in spots,

694
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,707
with a dash of newfoundland and whatnot.

695
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,374
- All right, Simpson, I saw
the car from the window.

696
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,333
You can let them in.

697
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:38,667
- Yes, sir John.

698
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,957
- Is it all right?

699
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:42,958
- Yes.

700
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,833
- Oh, hello, Jack.

701
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,833
- Hello, father.

702
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:12,125
This is miss Lia.

703
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,291
- Oh, delighted to see you, miss Lia.

704
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:18,416
- It's very good of you
to let me come, sir John.

705
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,000
- Well, not at all.

706
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,292
- If you'll come with
me, I'll show you around.

707
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:31,624
- I say, Smith, isn't this a bit thick?

708
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:32,874
I thought you said on the phone

709
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,082
that this girl was mixed
up with that murderer.

710
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,457
- Exactly.

711
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,707
Petrie, you're willing to take a risk

712
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,707
in order to help me trap fu manchu?

713
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,832
- Well, you know I am.

714
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:42,957
- Very well.

715
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,749
I'm convinced that girl is
a creature of fu manchu's

716
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,291
and I mean to use her.

717
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:50,041
Now, this is my plan.

718
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:54,542
- Oh, I don't know what I
would have done without you.

719
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,124
- Have I made myself clear?

720
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,624
- Perfectly.

721
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:11,957
- And you'll leave the details to me.

722
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:12,958
- Mm.

723
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:13,958
With the utmost confidence.

724
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,958
- All right.

725
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,957
- I say, you're not leaving us, inspector?

726
00:50:20,958 --> 00:50:23,125
- Yes, I'm off for London.

727
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,957
- Well, goodnight, Smith.

728
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,041
Goodnight.

729
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:30,042
- Goodbye.

730
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,333
I wish he hadn't gone.

731
00:50:58,917 --> 00:50:59,750
Phyllis!

732
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:01,374
Desist!

733
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,499
- You might try and see if you can get

734
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,666
something cheerful on
the radio, Sylvester.

735
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:05,667
- Yes.

736
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,999
It'll be a comfort to be
in touch at least once more

737
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,500
with civilization.

738
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:16,291
Dr. Fu manchu,

739
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:19,041
the murderer wanted by Scotland yard,

740
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,374
is still at large.

741
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:25,374
Report has been received
that he has left London

742
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,708
and is headed for the coast.

743
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:34,166
Oh, what is the matter?

744
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,957
- There's nothing the matter.

745
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,166
Be quiet, Phyllis.

746
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:48,292
Are you quite sure we're safe here?

747
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,499
- I never was surer.

748
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,643
Why, the old boys who built this place

749
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,416
were used to standing sieges.

750
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:56,707
Why, the sea is on three sides

751
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,416
and the front, a 12 foot wall

752
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:01,332
with a gate that a cat
couldn't get through.

753
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:04,582
There are two Scotland yard
men on guard night and day.

754
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:07,207
So you see, my dear, we're as safe...

755
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:10,332
Well, we're as safe as
the bank of england.

756
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,750
Oh!

757
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,041
- I say, that's a good one.

758
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,416
Only one of father's masks.

759
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:19,124
It is rather a ghastly thing.

760
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,416
You see, my father makes a hobby

761
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:22,791
of collecting all sorts of weird things.

762
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:24,957
He's a bit of an antiquarian.

763
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:27,291
He has a book he's
writing about his travels.

764
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:28,958
- Oh, hello, father.

765
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:29,792
- Hm.

766
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,433
- I was just telling Lia about your book.

767
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:35,374
Well, it's nothing, really, miss Lia.

768
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:38,457
Just a rough sketch, you know, and, er...

769
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,332
And, er, a few photographs.

770
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:42,375
Oh!

771
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,083
The dragon!

772
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:47,792
-Hmm.

773
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:52,042
Evidently, I am to be honored next.

774
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
- Well, who could have put it there?

775
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:06,957
Oh, you don't mean...

776
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:09,457
You don't think that I did it.

777
00:53:09,458 --> 00:53:10,792
- Of course not.

778
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,416
Well, someone must have slipped in

779
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:14,707
while we were upstairs.

780
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:39,958
- Sylvester!

781
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,332
What on earth are you doing here?

782
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,916
- I was trying to get something
cheerful on the radio,

783
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:46,917
when I...

784
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:51,708
Oh!

785
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,374
There's that horrid caterpillar again!

786
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:10,792
- It's your chauffer, sir.

787
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:12,832
- Why, what's happened?

788
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:14,332
- That broken tree across the road, sir,

789
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,874
when we drove down.

790
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,749
A great big chink was
hiding behind the hedge

791
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,332
with two others.

792
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,457
- You mean...

793
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,582
- Yes, sir.

794
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:23,374
They knocked me out, took my hat and coat,

795
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:26,082
and somebody else drove
you through the gates.

796
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,291
- Fu manchu is here.

797
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:28,874
In this house!

798
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:30,458
Oh, I know it!

799
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,500
I know it!

800
00:54:33,042 --> 00:54:34,166
Who turned out those lights?

801
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,333
Look out, father, look out!

802
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:40,791
Quick, somebody, strike a light!

803
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:41,625
Ah!

804
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:42,458
Are you all right?

805
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:43,957
- Yes, sir, I'm all right but look there.

806
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:44,833
- Good heavens!

807
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:46,499
- Missed me that time.

808
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,333
- Where?

809
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:48,374
Where's miss Lia?

810
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,707
Lia?

811
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,332
Lia?

812
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,374
Quick, everybody let's see,

813
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:55,042
we've got to scour and find her!

814
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,292
Lia!

815
00:54:58,293 --> 00:55:00,125
Miss Lia!

816
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:05,208
Lia!

817
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,207
It's no use, father.

818
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,666
We've searched the place
from the cellar to the tower,

819
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,832
but we can't find her.

820
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,916
- And you never will.

821
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:42,374
I tell you, my boy, there's
no question about it.

822
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,499
The girl's in league with that chinaman.

823
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,166
- I believe she is, sir.

824
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,874
- Oh, you're wrong, the both of you.

825
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:50,791
All this fighting with shadows.

826
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:54,499
If I could only get my hands on him.

827
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,875
- Oh, Phyllis, stop!

828
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:03,582
Dr. Fu manchu,
the notorious murderer,

829
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,833
still at large.

830
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,750
Wanted by Scotland yard.

831
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:13,499
- Phyllis, do you think I'll ever live

832
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,499
to eat tomorrow's marmalade?

833
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Oh!

834
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,291
- Well, if you will
stay with sir John, sir,

835
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:22,791
I'll join Wilkins at the gate.

836
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:23,792
- Right.

837
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,749
Let's have Simpson bring
us some coffee, father.

838
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,541
- Well, I'm sorry, son, but he's gone.

839
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:37,458
- Gone?

840
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:39,082
- After what happened in the hall,

841
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:42,249
the servants took the car
and simply cleared out.

842
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,832
- You don't mean to say
that we've only Sylvester

843
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,707
and those Scotland yard men left?

844
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:46,708
- Yes.

845
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:49,917
- Sir John!

846
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:51,832
Wilkins has disappeared!

847
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,667
- What?

848
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:53,542
- It's true, he's gone.

849
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,708
I can't find him anywhere.

850
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,541
- Well...

851
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,625
I should say that called for a drink.

852
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,416
- You know, I don't
think you quite realize

853
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:09,916
how serious this is, sir.

854
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:10,750
- Hm?
- No, thank you.

855
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,583
- Jack?

856
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:12,791
- Yes, thank you.

857
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:14,875
- Oh, I'm no fool, Trent.

858
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:19,041
I know I'm next on that chinaman's list.

859
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:21,457
After all, I went through the boxer rising

860
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,749
and I've been through the great war

861
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,124
and I'm not going to
lose any sleep over this.

862
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:27,125
- Cheerio.

863
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,624
- Now, you fellows can sit
up as long as you like.

864
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,166
I'm going to have a nap now.

865
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:36,541
- Well, very good, sir.

866
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:37,666
You better stay here, though,

867
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:40,416
where Dr. Petrie can keep his eye on you.

868
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:43,083
I'm going to call Scotland yard.

869
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,083
Exchange?

870
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,125
Exchange?

871
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:55,541
Exchange!

872
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,374
- What's up?

873
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:58,874
- The wires have been cut.

874
00:57:58,875 --> 00:57:59,875
- What?

875
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:02,250
- Please!

876
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,083
Please!

877
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:05,957
Help!

878
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:06,792
- Well, what's that?

879
00:58:06,793 --> 00:58:07,957
- Help, help!

880
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:08,792
Oh!

881
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:09,792
Oh, oh!

882
00:58:17,417 --> 00:58:18,417
Oh, oh...

883
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:21,500
- Oh, so it's you, is it?

884
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,042
- Is it?

885
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:27,542
Yes, I suppose it is.

886
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,333
All that's left of me.

887
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:33,750
- Well, what happened?

888
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:37,041
- Well, I was up on the landing

889
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,374
and I thought I heard someone.

890
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,666
So I tried to get behind the armor to hide

891
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:46,083
and as I backed into it, it sprang at me.

892
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:51,000
And I think I fell down the stairs.

893
00:58:56,792 --> 00:58:57,792
Yes, I did.

894
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:03,041
- Well, er, try and keep
quiet, will you, Sylvester?

895
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:05,249
I am trying to get a nap.

896
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,291
- Say, just keep an eye on
your father, will you, sir?

897
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,499
I want to have another look around.

898
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,166
- Righto.

899
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,083
And as for you, Sylvester,

900
00:59:11,084 --> 00:59:13,124
will you go somewhere and go to sleep?

901
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:17,542
Did you say "sleep?"

902
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,957
- Yes, sleep.

903
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:21,958
- All right.

904
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,083
Oh!

905
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:36,458
Oh!

906
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,750
- Father.

907
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:40,417
Father?

908
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:02,624
Dr. Fu manchu,
the notorious murderer,

909
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,541
still at large.

910
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:06,542
Wanted by Scotland yard.

911
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,750
Lia!

912
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:56,708
Smith, let me go!

913
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,750
Father!

914
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,916
Smith, where's my father?

915
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:03,833
- Oh, he's all right, Jack.

916
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:05,166
- I'm quite all right.

917
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:06,707
This was Smith's plan.

918
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,707
And it worked.

919
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,249
Trent's got the girl.

920
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,500
Come on, come on!

921
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
- Hold on.

922
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:27,541
She's been hypnotized

923
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:28,916
and doesn't know what she's doing.

924
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:29,917
Let her go.

925
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:31,500
- What?

926
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:32,624
- Let her go.

927
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,042
She may lead us to fu manchu.

928
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,750
Lia!

929
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,083
- Sir John.

930
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,457
You sit in that chair.

931
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:55,292
Trent.

932
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:56,125
Yes?

933
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:59,207
- Don't take your eyes
off him for a moment.

934
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,458
Dr. Jack, you come with me.

935
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:57,917
- It's all right, dear.

936
01:02:57,918 --> 01:02:59,208
You're safe.

937
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,250
Quite safe.

938
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,917
- Oh, has something terrible happened?

939
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:10,999
- You don't remember that
you tried to kill my father?

940
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,624
- Oh, no!

941
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,582
No, it isn't true!

942
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,416
- Oh, listen, darling,

943
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,166
didn't you know that
fu manchu has the power

944
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:20,874
to make you do anything he wishes?

945
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:24,624
You mean without my knowing?

946
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:25,625
- Yes.

947
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,916
And he made me try to kill your father.

948
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:32,917
Oh!

949
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,957
Oh, no, don't touch me, you mustn't.

950
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:39,374
Oh, I must go away from here.

951
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:41,666
He might make me hurt you!

952
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:43,499
Oh, please, let me go...

953
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,082
- Now, listen, darling, listen.

954
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:47,749
He had that power over you,

955
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,207
but he never can have it again.

956
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,082
Because now that you know,

957
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,541
we can fight it together.

958
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,332
Oh, no.

959
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,333
I'm afraid.

960
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,207
Horribly afraid.

961
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:04,457
Oh, I feel weak when I think of him.

962
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,124
- I hope you never meet him again.

963
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:08,916
But if you do

964
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:10,499
and he tries to get you into his power,

965
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,457
I want you to fight against him.

966
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:13,458
You must.

967
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:16,042
Remember I love you

968
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:18,958
and fight him.

969
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:28,750
Oh, remember you love me.

970
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:34,708
And fight him.

971
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,916
Oh, I will, Dr. Jack.

972
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,041
I will.

973
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:43,957
- He got away.

974
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,874
Is there any secret passage in this place?

975
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,082
- No.

976
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,624
Why, yes!

977
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:49,957
There's an old staircase leading down

978
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,166
from the tower room into
my father's library.

979
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:54,332
The library!

980
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:55,333
- Come, Lia!

981
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,833
- Trent! Trent!

982
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,083
Sir John!

983
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:18,249
- Father!

984
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,541
Father?

985
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:20,542
Father!

986
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,499
They must have taken
him down those stairs.

987
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,458
- I'll go.

988
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:27,916
See if you can do anything for Trent.

989
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,291
- Trent!

990
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,292
Trent!

991
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:32,792
Trent, what happened?

992
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,791
- Oh!
- Father!

993
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:41,792
Father!

994
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,250
He's dead.

995
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,833
Oh, it's fu manchu!

996
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:49,667
Lia!

997
01:05:49,667 --> 01:05:50,667
Oh, no!

998
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:51,667
No!

999
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:19,125
- A monument to your honorable father.

1000
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:23,625
But for you is reserved a higher place.

1001
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,957
Your debt means the
gliding of the last scale

1002
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:31,041
and the completion of my work.

1003
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,541
Oh, no!

1004
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:35,542
No!

1005
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:38,957
- You do not wish me to kill him?

1006
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:40,416
Very well.

1007
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:43,417
I shall not kill him, little flower.

1008
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,667
You shall kill him yourself.

1009
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,250
Oh, oh!

1010
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,832
- Look at me, Lia.

1011
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:05,833
Look!

1012
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,625
You shall do as I say.

1013
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,917
Do you hear me, Lia?

1014
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,666
- I hear you, master.

1015
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:36,832
Lia!

1016
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:37,667
Oh, Lia!

1017
01:07:37,668 --> 01:07:39,250
- You are my slave.

1018
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,082
- I am your slave.

1019
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,457
No, no, Lia!

1020
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:46,292
- You are my slave.

1021
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:48,792
Fight him, fight him!

1022
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:52,374
- Oh, I am fighting.

1023
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,375
I am fighting, Dr. Jack!

1024
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,625
Ah!

1025
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:04,042
Ah!

1026
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,624
Oh!

1027
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,541
Oh, you have no power over me!

1028
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:13,583
I'm not afraid!

1029
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,708
I congratulate you.

1030
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:33,417
And you, too, doctor, for your
prodigious mental victory.

1031
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:39,041
- You can't make me kill him!

1032
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:42,291
- That is as you like, my child.

1033
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,207
But as for your sweetheart,

1034
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:47,542
I think he would rather die by your hand

1035
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:52,667
than to suffer the death
of a thousand deaths.

1036
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:09,499
Here is proof that I am prepared.

1037
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,082
Come.

1038
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:13,083
Come, look for yourself.

1039
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,083
Oh!

1040
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:24,666
- An especially prepared quicklime,

1041
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:27,207
most advantageous when you do not wish

1042
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,625
to leave a trace.

1043
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:34,291
- You'll pay for this when Smith gets you.

1044
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:35,624
And he will, too!

1045
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,582
Don't ever doubt that.

1046
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:38,957
He will!

1047
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,750
- I humbly apologize.

1048
01:09:43,417 --> 01:09:47,916
I'm afraid my somewhat
weird and oriental methods

1049
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:51,332
may have misled your occidental mind

1050
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:54,624
into believing that this is nothing but

1051
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:56,292
a gigantic melodrama

1052
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:01,708
in which the detective's
arrival at the last moment

1053
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:07,958
produces the happy ending.

1054
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,124
Don't deny it.

1055
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:14,125
I can see by your face it is so.

1056
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:25,333
Permit me to settle that
idea once and for all.

1057
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:30,333
- Smith!

1058
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:32,292
- Exactly.

1059
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,083
As you see,

1060
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:46,124
you can scarcely expect the usual ending.

1061
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,332
You!

1062
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,167
You!

1063
01:10:48,168 --> 01:10:49,500
- Bear yourself.

1064
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,125
I ask you, Dr. Petrie,

1065
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:58,332
what western mind could have conceived

1066
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:00,917
this little pleasantry of mine?

1067
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,082
For years, I raised this girl

1068
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:08,624
and planned that she should
fall in love with you

1069
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,042
and you with her.

1070
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:16,457
Then I caused you to meet
romantically

1071
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,458
In the fog.

1072
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:20,832
And now it is my plan

1073
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:22,917
that she should kill you.

1074
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:27,541
The idea of allowing a
girl to kill her lover...

1075
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:31,874
- To save him from a worse death

1076
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,542
is rather intriguing, is it not?

1077
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,500
Eh?

1078
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:46,916
And to prove to you that I
have the soul of romance,

1079
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:51,417
I shall allow you a few
delicious moments of farewell.

1080
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:58,125
But I should not advise
your attempting to escape,

1081
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,000
nor loose your bonds,

1082
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,625
as I shall be on guard out there.

1083
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:13,166
Ah!

1084
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,374
I had forgotten.

1085
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:20,375
The scene calls for a
little soft music.

1086
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:32,500
And to make it quite perfect...

1087
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:39,583
Darkness holds magic for romance.

1088
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:49,250
- How long will you give us?

1089
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:54,541
- We are unfortunately
lacking in timepieces.

1090
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,332
Do you see that moonbeam

1091
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,583
crawling along these walls?

1092
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:04,499
It shall be your clock.

1093
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,582
- You mean...

1094
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,583
- I mean

1095
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,458
when the moonbeam touches the dragon,

1096
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,625
I shall return.

1097
01:13:28,042 --> 01:13:30,708
Believe me, honorable inspector,

1098
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:34,542
I regret that our contest is ended.

1099
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,833
Yours is the first intellect

1100
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:43,332
that I have really respected
since I left China.

1101
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,707
Hm.

1102
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,374
It is too bad that your
affection for petrie

1103
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:49,207
so overcame your judgment

1104
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:53,707
that you forgot that
redmoat is an historic house

1105
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:57,791
and that anyone might get
a plan of it at the museum.

1106
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:00,082
Hm?

1107
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:02,291
You see, it is little things like that

1108
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:05,958
which prove my mind to
be superior to yours.

1109
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:17,499
Your efficient subordinates
are searching for you.

1110
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Diligently.

1111
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:22,917
Perhaps it would interest
you to watch, hm?

1112
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:40,792
Mm, it is too bad their
effort should be so useless.

1113
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:47,166
I am sorry if the ropes are tight.

1114
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,583
But I assure you they shall
not trouble you for long.

1115
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,999
Within an hour, my work
shall be completed here

1116
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,166
and I shall be on my way.

1117
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,167
To China.

1118
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,291
And as a matter of courtesy,

1119
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:06,207
so that no one will know
that I was the Victor

1120
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,125
and you the vanquished,

1121
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,791
I assure you that your body,

1122
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:13,749
if it is found,

1123
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,167
will be quite unrecognizable.

1124
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:18,917
No, Lia.

1125
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,625
Don't cry.

1126
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:25,666
If there's any memory left me

1127
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:26,667
out there,

1128
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:30,374
I want it to be of your smile.

1129
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,875
- I'll try to smile.

1130
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,957
- I regret to interrupt.

1131
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,500
The time has come

1132
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,667
for guest tea.

1133
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:10,542
You may have the pleasure of
serving Dr. Petrie, my child.

1134
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:20,666
No.

1135
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:21,667
That cup.

1136
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:37,166
Fool!

1137
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:38,167
Out!

1138
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:55,708
Guest tea, Dr. Petrie.

1139
01:17:56,917 --> 01:18:01,500
The drink we serve our friends
just before they depart.

1140
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:18,708
You have not kept your
word, little flower.

1141
01:18:19,708 --> 01:18:23,249
In order to poison me,
you have lost your chance

1142
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,957
to save your sweetheart from that!

1143
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:27,750
Oh, no!

1144
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,750
No, no!

1145
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,375
Oh!

1146
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:31,375
- Too late.

1147
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:33,749
You know I always keep my word.

1148
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,332
Quick!

1149
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:41,791
I think inspector Smith would enjoy this.

1150
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:42,792
Bring him.

1151
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:47,583
- Oh, no!

1152
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,582
Please, please!

1153
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:52,166
- Too late.

1154
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,042
Too late.

1155
01:18:53,043 --> 01:18:54,082
- Oh, no!

1156
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,917
You can't be so cruel!

1157
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,416
No!

1158
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:01,791
- Release him.

1159
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:03,792
But keep his hands tied.

1160
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:07,042
Ah!

1161
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,749
You, no doubt, have witnessed
many executions, inspector,

1162
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,957
but I think this one will
interest you, eh?

1163
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:16,958
Singh!

1164
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:19,750
Smith!

1165
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:21,332
- You see, Dr. Fu,

1166
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,999
you did overlook something.

1167
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,250
You forgot that fai lu loved that girl.

1168
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,499
- Police!

1169
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Police!

1170
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:36,332
Fu manchu here!

1171
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,917
- Come on upstairs!

1172
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:40,707
- You blundering fool!

1173
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:42,499
- Hold where you are!

1174
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,375
Are you all right, chief?

1175
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:45,125
- Here you are, boys.

1176
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,042
- Forgive me, Smith.

1177
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,333
Soon I shall be with my ancestors.

1178
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,583
Gods of my ancestors.

1179
01:20:23,292 --> 01:20:24,375
I only regret

1180
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,167
that I still lack one life

1181
01:20:29,375 --> 01:20:31,625
to complete my masterpiece.

1182
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:53,167
After all, inspector,

1183
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:59,208
our story ends in the usual way.
