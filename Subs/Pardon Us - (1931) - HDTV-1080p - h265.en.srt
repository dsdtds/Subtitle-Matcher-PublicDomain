1
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,643
This is the place I “was telling you about.

2
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,006
Twelve pounds of sugar...

3
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,410
Three cans malt.

4
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,958
Twelve cakes of yeast. Pfft!

5
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,966
What did you say?

6
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,723
Twelve cakes of yeast. Pfft!

7
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,728
When are you gonna get that tooth fixed?

8
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,688
Every time you speak
you make a funny noise.

9
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,045
It sounds like a pipe organ.

10
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,690
One dozen packages of hops.

11
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,364
And three crooks.

12
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,406
Now, let's see.

13
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,526
Carry two.

14
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,525
Now. For eight dollars and six cents,
are can make 15 gallons.

15
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,043
But we can't drink 15 gallons. Pfft!

16
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,246
What we can't drink, are can sell.

17
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,962
Come on.

18
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,125
- Hello, Warden.
- Hello, John.

19
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,565
- How's everything?
- Pretty busy.

20
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,881
I've got a couple of fish for you. So long.

21
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,404
See you later. Bye, boys.

22
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,763
Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

23
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,802
What do you mean I got you into? Pfft!

24
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,568
Well, you sold that policeman
that bottle of beer, didn't you?

25
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,762
I didn't know he was a policeman.

26
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,001
I thought he “was
a street car conductor. Pfft!

27
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,446
Hey, me over here.

28
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,242
- What's your name?
- Stanley Laurel.

29
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,564
Say 'sir' when you're addressing me.

30
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,606
Now what's your name?

31
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,045
Sir Stanley Laurel. Pfft!

32
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,606
He can't help that, sir.
It's a loose tooth, sir.

33
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,170
Yeah? Well, we'll be seeing to that.

34
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,206
What's your name?

35
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,439
Oliver Nowell Hardy... sir.

36
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,246
Hm!

37
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,321
A couple of beer barons, eh?

38
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,366
All right, Shields. Frisk 'em.

39
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,526
OK.

40
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,486
All right. Give 'em the works.

41
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,806
Come on.

42
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,726
Come on. Let's go.

43
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,242
Smile.

44
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,246
Next.

45
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,328
Pssst!

46
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,640
Smile.

47
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,646
Fine.

48
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,686
Come on.

49
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,687
If they turn out good, can I have one?

50
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,726
Come on. Get outta here.

51
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,566
Come on.

52
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,125
Hey, you. Fall in.

53
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,685
Huh. Clowning, eh?

54
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,726
Let's go.

55
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,480
The new men are here, sir.

56
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,961
My, my.

57
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,006
And still they me.

58
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,848
Let us begin with a perfect understanding.

59
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,999
I am just as sorry to see you here
as you are to be here.

60
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,650
Keep one thing in mind.

61
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,722
It all depends on you yourselves

62
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,849
just how you're going to fare
during your stay here.

63
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,398
Never forget that this is a prison.

64
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,403
And in a prison, all rules must be obeyed.

65
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,359
Discipline is the one thing
that must be observed.

66
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,409
If you are good prisoners,
everything will be OK.

67
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,403
If you're not, if you break the rules,

68
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,802
then it will be just plain hell on earth.

69
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,883
Do you understand?

70
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,279
Yes, sir. Pfft!

71
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,406
- It was his...
- Shut up, you!

72
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,446
Put 'em in cell 14.

73
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,486
Not in the with the Tiger, sir.

74
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,686
- Put them in cell 14!
- Yes, sir!

75
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,603
Get them out of here
before I lose my temper.

76
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,648
Talking to the warden like that!

77
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,686
A fine piece of business!

78
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,169
Convicts talking to the warden.

79
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,844
Why, I'll take those men
and I'll break 'em!

80
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,799
I'll put 'em in cell 14 and I'll get a hose
in there! That's what I'll do.

81
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,966
Upstairs.

82
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,650
This way.

83
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,688
- Hello, there, buddy.
- Shut up!

84
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,366
- What?
- Amos and Andy.

85
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,323
Hello, squirt.

86
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,560
Hello. Pfft!

87
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,080
All right. Inside.

88
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,806
Come on. Inside!

89
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,880
I said, hello, squirt.

90
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,040
Hello. Pfft!

91
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,967
- I'm sorry, sir, but that “was his...
- Shut up!

92
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,245
Hey, hey, hey!

93
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,242
What are you doing there?
Keep off of my head!

94
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,970
Pardon me. I'm a stranger here.

95
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,526
Put her there.

96
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,766
You're the first guy that ever had
the nerve to raspberry the Tiger.

97
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,326
I like a guy that does that.

98
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,006
What are you in for?

99
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,928
We're a couple of beer barons.

100
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,363
- Ah, shut up!

101
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,922
Hey. You and me is gonna be good pals.

102
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,399
Thank you. Pfft!

103
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,122
Hey.

104
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,678
I heard you the first time.

105
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,365
Now don't take advantage
of my good humour.

106
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,964
- If you do...

107
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,006
Hey!

108
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,365
What's going on in there?

109
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,408
Here? Oh, it's the fish.

110
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,562
Er, just a little nervous, I guess.

111
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,566
One more peep
and I'll throw you in the hole.

112
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,289
Turn it in there. Go to bed.

113
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,122
OK.

114
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,482
Hey. Pipe down, in there.
Pipe down.

115
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,439
Good morning, pupils.

116
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,044
Good morning, teacher.

117
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,286
Very. Very good.

118
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,043
Now, once more.

119
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,125
In as much as you are new pupils,
I'll excuse that.

120
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,770
But I'll have no playing in my class!

121
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,320
Now, the first lesson
this morning will be...

122
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,765
Aha!

123
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,962
Aha!

124
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,884
- Sit down!

125
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,368
Er... We will now have the roll call.

126
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,483
Those that are here will answer 'Present'.
Those that are not here will say 'Absent'.

127
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,050
We shall now have Ah! Intelligence test.

128
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,287
- Who was Columbus?
- The mayor of Ohio.

129
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,960
- What did he do?
- He died.

130
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,048
Well, of course he died. Who killed him?

131
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,519
Cock Robin.

132
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,329
- Who said that?
- I did.

133
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,846
Correct.

134
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,918
What is a blizzard?

135
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,326
A blizzard?

136
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,284
A blizzard is the inside of a buzzard.

137
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,086
Fresh, huh?

138
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,008
How many times does three go into nine?

139
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,239
- Three times.
- Correct.

140
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,890
And two left over.

141
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,320
- What are you laughing at?
- There's only one left over.

142
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,366
D'oh!

143
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,124
Listen. You spell 'needle'.

144
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,643
N-E-I-D-L-E.

145
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,644
There is no 'I' in needle.

146
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,646
Then it's a rotten needle.

147
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,806
Who did that?

148
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,366
If I find out who did it,
they'll stand in the corner.

149
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,806
- Now...

150
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,846
What is a meteor?

151
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,886
You.

152
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,926
Comet?

153
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,444
A meteor is a star with a tail on it.

154
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,486
Right.

155
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,168
Name one.

156
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,206
Rin Tin Tin.

157
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,322
D'oh!

158
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,483
Just for that, you'll stay after school.

159
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,528
Let's see
what I taught you yesterday.

160
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,488
One plus one is two.
Two and two is four.

161
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,529
Three and three is six.
Four and four is eight.

162
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,762
Five and five is ten. Six and six is 12.

163
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:59,560
Seven and seven is 14.
Eight and eight is 16.

164
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,848
Nine and nine is 18. Ten and ten is 20...

165
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,686
Very good.

166
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,966
All right. Inside.

167
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,726
Not you.

168
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,846
This is your suite.

169
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,286
Have you got the time?

170
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,079
- Ollie?
- What?

171
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,003
I wonder how long we're
going to be in here.

172
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,445
Oh, about two months, I guess.

173
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,408
Gee. That's a month apiece.

174
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,446
'A month apiece'!

175
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,320
You can take it from me.
When I get out, I'm going back on the farm.

176
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,366
Boy, there's the life.

177
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,566
I can see it now.

178
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,007
Rows and rows of sweet corn
swaying in the breezes.

179
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,162
Honey bees buzzing in the clover.

180
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,287
And the smell of new-mown hay in the air.

181
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,326
- Ollie?
- What?

182
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,446
Did you say you can see all that?

183
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,486
Why, certainly.

184
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,165
That's funny. I can't see a thing.
It's dark in here.

185
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,810
Haven't you got any imagination?

186
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,088
Can't you imagine us
growing strawberries and raspberries?

187
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,126
I don't like raspberries.

188
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,089
Well, we'll grow watermelons.
Sun-kissed watermelons.

189
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,401
We'll plant acres and acres of watermelons.

190
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,640
We'll have more than we can eat.

191
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,688
And what we
can't eat, we can sell.

192
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,288
Well, just for that,
I won't take you with me.

193
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,966
Don't leave me here!
Shut up! Go to sleep, you guys!

194
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,162
Hey, fellas, this looks like our big day.

195
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,402
What's the use? They've doubled the guards
on the gate. We'll never get through.

196
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,529
It's now or never. If are don't take a
chance now, how are are gonna find out?

197
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,647
- Look. They're opening the gates.

198
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,880
Now's our chance.

199
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,449
Wail a minute, wail a minute.
Let's... I've got Ah! Idea.

200
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,328
I'll find out what's outside of them gates.

201
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,846
Hey.

202
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,285
Hello, pal. Hey. Pal-

203
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,326
- How are you?
- Hello, buddy.

204
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,366
Come over here.

205
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,089
- Hello, there.
- Well, well, well.

206
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,126
Where have you guys been?

207
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,485
We've been down in the hole.

208
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,720
Solitary confinement.

209
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,370
- All right.

210
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,528
- What's wrong, man?
- It's the Tiger.

211
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,808
They've made a break with those
two new fish. They have a running start.

212
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,678
Call out every man. Cover every inch
of ground, north, south, east, west.

213
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,924
Call up every police station within 50 miles.
Get in touch with the sheriffs office.

214
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:03,209
We captured the Tiger's gang. We caught
them down the old stone quarry.

215
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:06,965
But it's those two new fish.
They got away. Not a sign of them.

216
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,644
They disappeared as if
the earth swallowed them.

217
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,121
Well, don't worry about those two babes
in the woods. Use the bloodhounds.

218
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,681
Those hounds never fail. They'll trail
them so straight, it'll be a cinch.

219
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,728
Those hounds are ferocious killers. Ha ha!

220
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,088
I'd like to see their face
when they hear those hounds. Hop to it.

221
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,922
Yes, sir.

222
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,806
Call it a day.

223
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,602
They'll never recognise us
in a hundred years.

224
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,966
For on in your life,
you've hit upon a good idea.

225
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,166
A practical idea.

226
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,003
Say, what about the tooth, the buzzer?

227
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, I fixed that too. I vulcanized it.

228
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,720
- You what?
- I vulcanized it.

229
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,042
I put some chewing gum in there
and it don't buzz any more.

230
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,564
You're actually using your brains.

231
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,801
That's what mes
from associating with me.

232
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,400
- What do you mean, associating...
- Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.

233
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,121
- Tut-tut-tut-tut...

234
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,008
Come on here.
You're always dragging behind.

235
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,206
Come here.

236
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,406
Now, me on. Let's go.

237
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,845
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

238
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,886
That's the way. Come on.

239
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,125
I'm going to name this one Oliver.

240
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,049
Sing it, boys.

241
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,159
- Now what's the matter?
- Why, Father, I don't know.

242
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:35,324
Course, this would have to happen just
when I'm due back at the prison at noon.

243
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,930
I'll see if I can locate the trouble.

244
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,006
- D'you know anything about Ah! Auto-mobile?
- Yes, Dad'am.

245
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,686
- I wonder if you'd give us a hand.
- Oh, we'd be very glad to.

246
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,168
- Something went wrong with the car.
- Have you got any tools, lady?

247
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,605
Yes, they're under the back seat.

248
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,285
Just a minute.

249
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,645
Ow!

250
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,686
What's going on here?

251
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,921
Oh, Daddy, I'm so sorry.

252
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,161
These two men are going
to help us with the car.

253
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,921
All right. I'll keep my head
out of the way next time.

254
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,239
He doesn't know us.

255
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,286
Now, let's see, er...

256
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,565
The caricature, now, er...

257
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,040
No, it must be the generator.
No, it can't be.

258
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,486
The spark plugs. Now, let's see. Let's see.

259
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,720
Ow!

260
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:52,167
Get your hands off of it!
Get under the car and see if this works.

261
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,680
I'll do it.

262
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,446
Why don't you look out, Bill?

263
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,042
Why, Dad.

264
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,402
We're out of gas.

265
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,366
Well, no wonder it wouldn't run.

266
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,169
Hey, Oliver? Er... Sambo?

267
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,202
They're out of gas.

268
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,886
Well, there we are.

269
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,926
Now...

270
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,523
Well, thank you, boys. Here's my card.

271
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,044
Any time you're up my way, drop in,

272
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,043
You can work for me any time.

273
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,446
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye!

274
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,843
Goodbye. Pfft!

275
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,445
Let's walk around
and see if we know anybody.

276
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,006
J'So early.

277
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,767
Say, fellas, how about another one?

278
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,808
Down on the farm. That's the life.

279
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,046
That was fine, boys.

280
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,166
It sure was. Pfft!

281
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,324
- What did you say?
- That's a loose tooth, sir, that does that.

282
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,402
Oh, it is? That should be attended to.

283
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,199
Yes, sir. As soon as I get out,
I'm gonna have it fixed.

284
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,680
Do you know that song
about 'the yanks are coming'?

285
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,762
Come on. We're gonna yank that tooth.

286
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,806
Come on.

287
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,086
Come on!

288
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,799
All right. I'll take you now.

289
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,526
Come on.

290
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,280
Here's another customer for you.

291
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,089
- Fix him up.
- OK.

292
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,401
Hey, rosebud? Sit down.

293
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,806
Ow!

294
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,766
I sneaked in.

295
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,246
- Ollie?
- What?

296
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,286
I'm scared.

297
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,124
Why, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I'll stay fight with you.

298
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,962
- Come on. You're next.
- Please, no, no, no!

299
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,006
Come on, me on.

300
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,809
You won't hurt me, will you, Doctor?

301
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,046
Don't think about it.

302
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,086
All right, rosebud.

303
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,763
Not him. You!

304
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,886
Come on. Sit down.

305
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,562
Do you mind if I have my friend
in here with me?

306
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,402
OK.

307
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,806
Oh-ho-ho!

308
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,166
Ah, stop your playing.

309
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:48,206
Which one is it?

310
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,246
This one.

311
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,565
- Does it hurt?
- Uh-uh.

312
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,246
- Then what are you having it pulled for?
- It's only loose. It buzzes.

313
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,402
- It buzzes?
- Yes, sir. Pfft!

314
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:06,886
OK. Sit down.

315
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,847
Upper left molar, Doctor. It's a buzzer.

316
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:14,727
OK.

317
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,766
Sit down.

318
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,603
I'm scared.

319
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,760
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.

320
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,719
Sit down. Whoever heard of
a dentist hurting you these days?

321
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:29,563
Why, you won't even feel it.

322
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,246
You won't feel it but how about me?
How about those other fellas?

323
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:37,720
They were only laughing.

324
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,366
You know, there are times
when you try my patience.

325
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:49,045
There's nothing to it.
It's all in your mind.

326
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,918
Now, just sit back and relax.

327
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,048
Why, they could pull every tooth in my head
and I wouldn't even feel it.

328
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,121
Why didn't you mu him?

329
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,926
I thought you were laughing.

330
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,482
Say, what are you beefin' about?
Didn't I get the right tooth?

331
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:52,562
You got the fight tooth but the wrong man.

332
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,963
Oh, I beg your pardon.

333
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,966
Steady.

334
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,200
Let me get the right one.

335
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,959
Sea? It didn't hurt a bit, did it?

336
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,006
Not a bit. Pfft!

337
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,923
Ooh! We gotta get outta here!

338
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,806
Listen. Everything is OK.

339
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,688
Don't get nervous when the time mes.

340
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:41,887
- I ain't nervous. I'll go right now.
- Wail a minute.

341
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,643
Back, you dumbbell.
You wanna kill everything?

342
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,563
Tiger's plotting again, is he?
How did you find out?

343
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:52,326
We overheard those two new fish
talking it over. You wanna see 'em?

344
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,366
No. I haven't time.

345
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:59,525
So, the Tiger and his gang
are at it again, eh?

346
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,761
I've no time to question
those two fish now.

347
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,806
I'll tell you what to do.

348
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:09,485
Double the guard on the front gate.
Put more men on the walls.

349
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:13,404
Pull a guard around the arsenal.
Tell the governor we may need the militia.

350
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:18,245
Train your biggest guns on the front gate.
That's where we'll need the most.

351
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,844
So they wanted a showdown, did they?

352
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,888
They wanted a fight to a finish, did they?

353
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,168
Well, by the livin' Lucifer,
they're going to get it!

354
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,206
Go on, now, hop to it.

355
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,923
Hey. What's the big idea?

356
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,805
We're just in conference.

357
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,599
Well, do your conferring
down at the mess hall. Fall in.

358
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,922
We are not going to the mess hall.
We are not going to eel.

359
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,966
You're not going to eat?

360
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,006
No. We're on a hunger strike.

361
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,728
Emphatically.

362
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,926
What?

363
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:12,084
You're going to pass up
that nice, big roast turkey?

364
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,285
With chestnut dressing...

365
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:19,646
and sweet potatoes, southern style?

366
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,644
Great big pan of hot biscuit?

367
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:31,123
And strawberry short cake,
smothered in whipped cream?

368
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:37,479
Sprinkled with powdered sugar, with a nice
big maraschino cherry on the top of it?

369
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:46,559
Close followed by a nice big slice
of ice cold watermelon.

370
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,403
And a big, black cigar.

371
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,126
Ally nuts?

372
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,926
All you can eat of them.

373
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:10,121
How about postponing the strike
till tomorrow?

374
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,042
Well...

375
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,167
But not one minute after tomorrow.

376
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,246
Come on. Fall in.

377
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,400
Find yourself a seat down there.

378
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,126
Hey!

379
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,770
What about that turkey dinner?

380
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:44,000
- Sit down, you!

381
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,683
Haven't we had bad luck enough
without you spilling the salt?

382
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,160
Make a wish and throw some
over your left shoulder.

383
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,926
Psst! Psst!

384
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:48,678
Hey. What happened upstairs?

385
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:53,002
You're going to get it.
The warden's gonna fix you.

386
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,160
Huh?

387
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,166
And he said...

388
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,649
They squealed on us, the dirty rats.

389
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,686
Yeah.

390
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,206
- But I'll get 'em.
- I'll say we'll get 'em.

391
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,360
- After dinner.
- I got ya.

392
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,768
We're free
and nobody knows where we are.

393
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:27,125
Let's go. Shh!

394
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,880
Let's get in here.

395
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:12,806
You dirty double-crossed.

396
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,322
Quick!

397
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:00,007
Do something! Hey, hey, hey! Hey. Hey. Hey!

398
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,486
Hey!

399
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,086
Help! Save me!

400
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,126
The house is on fire.

401
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,166
Help! Fire!

402
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:48,684
Come on. We've got to go to her rescue.

403
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,287
Save me! Save me!

404
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:58,680
Wail there.

405
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,850
Help! Save me!

406
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,805
Help! Fire!

407
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:47,281
Fire!

408
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,044
Save me! Help!

409
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,603
Help! Fire!

410
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:25,720
Help! Fire!

411
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,166
- Ah!

412
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:18,285
Why did you fire like that in the mess hall?
They changed the lock before we got ready!

413
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,486
- Hey, Tiger!
- What do you want?

414
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:23,209
- Look what I got!
- Oh, great, great!

415
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:27,044
Now we can make our getaway
through the left wing!

416
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:56,520
Come on. Let's get 'em.

417
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,926
Why don't you be careful?

418
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:47,168
The dirty double-crosser.
He tried to mow us down like rats.

419
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,606
My boys.

420
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:16,045
And you are my boys.

421
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:20,726
I hold in my hands
the pardons for both of you.

422
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:29,283
This is the State's gesture in showing
its appreciation of your bravery.

423
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,680
It was the filing of the signal shots
in the mess hall

424
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:37,844
that saved us from a disaster
of cataclysmic dimensions.

425
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,447
Thank you, sir.

426
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,486
No" go.

427
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,526
Begin life anew.

428
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:52,566
Forget this.

429
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,608
Let this episode here be just a hiatus...

430
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,045
to be obliterated from your memory.

431
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,839
And don't forget that I'm your friend.

432
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:07,969
Anything that I can do
to help you start where you left off,

433
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,280
call on me at any time.

434
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:14,522
Thank you, sir. We'll start all over again.

435
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:16,566
We certainly will.

436
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:19,608
Can we take your order
for a couple of cases?

437
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,601
Pffft!

438
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,646
Why, you...
