OWEN DAYBRIGHT
(VOICEOVER): I got a story

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,999
to tell, yarn about cow
country and cowpunchers,

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,879
cattle and men.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,909
I was working for the Strobie
Ranch, learning my trade.

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,719
Trade a worn leather saddle
blisters and branding irons.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,769
Trade with some song,
some fun, some blood.

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,929
It was as good a job
as a man could ask for.

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,629
Lonely sometimes,
cold, so much distance,

12
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,339
you thought you'd
never get back.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,449
But for me, a young
kid, it was a fine time.

14
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,819
Memories are mostly good.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,439
You're up there on
top of the world

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,079
where the air was
clear and thin.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,659
The only sound was
the wind in the pines.

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,899
We were in the business
of growing beef.

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,919
Always moving the cattle,
looking for new feed.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,439
They were those new
bald-faced Herefords,

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,609
not like the longhorns.

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,329
Wild and spooky, but
friendly critters.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,729
Gentle as a dog.

24
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,719
Seasons melted away peaceful,
from spring to summer,

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,659
fall, then winter.

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,579
Cows had to look out for
themselves in the snow.

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,069
The winter drift.

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,379
As soon as a man on
horseback could get around,

29
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,579
they'd go out and
locate the cattle,

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,959
spot them for the
spring roundup.

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,909
They'd come back from the
winter drift, cold and worn out.

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,829
Our foreman was Owen Daybright.

33
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,819
He knew what he was doing.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,089
We all liked him.

35
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,569
And there was his foster
brother, Lee Strobie.

36
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,834
Their father owned the ranch.

37
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,555
The night they got
back, the trouble began.

38
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,899
Well, look who's turned up?

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,899
Hi, Cal.

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,569
People still drink whisky?

41
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,569
Hi, Lee.

42
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,074
Be down to my shoes.

43
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,249
That's comes from working for
someone you've known too long,

44
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,250
Lee.

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,769
See my wife this winter?

46
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,874
Jen coming down a couple
of times with your old man.

47
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:31,874
How did Arch look?

48
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,629
Oh, just fair, I'd say.

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,584
Cold weather always
seems to bother him.

50
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:36,749
How did Jen look?

51
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,844
Way to find that out is go
home and see for yourself.

52
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,449
Can I borrow your razor, Cal?

53
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,519
I don't want to scare.

54

56
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,869
CAL: I've been trying to get
him all day for that girl

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,529
that used to work
at the Eaton house.

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,279
LEE STROBIE: Lily?

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,765
CAL: I wouldn't know her name.

60
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,879
What's her trouble, doc?

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,549
Oh, small variety.

62
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,379
About that big.

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,401
Arrived a couple of
hours ago, they tell me.

64
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,819
You wouldn't go?

65
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,709
That's right.

66
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,524
I don't take calls like this
until I hear from the father.

67
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,525
That isn't likely.

Get down and walk over here
so I can see who you are.

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Get down now!

72
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:47,794
Owen, is that you?

73
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,569
Yeah.

74
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,069
Put that gun down.

75
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,069

Helping.

79
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,674
Nobody else would come.

80
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:12,989
So I heard.

81
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,494
How's Lee?

82
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,398
Wanting to see you.

83
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,999
I'll be home as
soon as she's asleep.

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,429
Her brother Dick
Fasken from out of town.

86
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,675
He spent the day
looking for the man.

Lily all right?

think about it, Lily.

Not now.

102
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:21,199
I'm really pretty lucky, Owen.

We're grateful to.

Sounds queer to say it here now,
but he'll have a good life on.

we kept the cattle alive.

in at the ranch.

That'll be Lily's
business, wouldn't it?

I'll find out for sure.

I'll find out if it
takes me a lifetime.

That's right.

How much?

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,869
$500.

148
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,699
He brought this food too.

149
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,203
Why?

150
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:23,209
You're wrong.

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,069
He's good.

152
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,316
And there's no one else
around here like him.

Hey, he keeps
his aces a kicker.

156

And he draws to it
every time, three times.

It's paid for.

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,559
You paid for a coat.

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,689
I appreciate it.

This isn't the first
time you saved my hide.

Why don't you grow up, boy?

Oh, kid, it happens.

before I met Jen.

understand it.

You know what she's like.

Why should I know
what she's like?

Oh, that's right, you don't.

She's what all the
others weren't.

She's everything I
ever wanted for myself.

at, Daybright.

00:10:04,264 --> 00:10:06,389
That's right.

186
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,649
Don't she need it?

187
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,589
Not that kind.

188
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,589
That wasn't grub money.

189
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,709
It was get out of town money.

190
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,899
I'll ask you one time.

191
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,294
Was it yours?

192
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:19,710
Point that gun to the
floor, son, and turn around.

193
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,529
There'll be other times.

194
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,229
You're a conclusion
jumper, my friend.

195
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,229
I don't like them.

196
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,229
CON ALVIS: Quit it, Owen.

197
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,539
I'll handle this myself, Con.

198
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,329
Not as long as I'm sheriff.

199
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,380
All right, Con.

200
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,789
You've scared me twice tonight.

201
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,530
Next time you point a
gun at me, shoot it.

[music playing]

203
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,119
Well, welcome home, boy.

204
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,119
How are you?

205
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,129
You look fit, son.

206
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,479
How are you, Owen?
- Good.

207
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,479
How's the leg?

208
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,479
Got the misery.

209
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,939
Same as every
winter for 20 years.

210
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,579
- Evening, boys.
- Hello, Mr. Willoughby.

211
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,579
Hello, Mr. Willoughby.

212
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,589
Thought you might want
some hot coffee, Arch.

213
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,689
Well, thank you,
Mr. Willoughby.

214
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,509
Same old dishwater?

215
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,019
You don't want any, huh?

216
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,739
Oh, no, I'm just kidding.

217
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,849
Then watch your language.

218
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,814
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: How's
the bad stomach?

219
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:04,049
Owen, some days, I doubt
if I'll make it till sundown.

220
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,594
Well, why don't you stop
eating your own cooking?

221
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,889
Oh, I'm stuck here.

222
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,890
Can't help it.

223
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,069
Arch, these cigars
ain't from Pittsburgh.

224
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,115
Kansas City.

225
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:24,145
Lee sure isn't
going downhill fast.

226
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,229
How'd it go?

227
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,749
Ask the foreman.

228
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,404
I just took orders.

229
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,579
You got a wife
waiting for you.

230
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,969
I haven't forgotten.

231
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,239
I'll look in on her.

ARCH STROBIE: Good night, son.

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,839
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: Night, Lee.

235
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,614
Boy looks trim.

236
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,954
Nobody could have
worked harder this winter.

237
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:54,909
He's got a lot to make up for.

238
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,829
He'll come around.

239
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,259
Maybe Jen has something
to do with it.

240
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,749
Anyway, he can
handle it alone now.

241
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,333
Well, it sounds like
you're giving notice, Owen.

242
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:09,339
Well, he's married now.

243
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,379
Jen's a fine daughter for you.

244
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,849
I'm just crowding the place.

245
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,919
Oh, if you're not
comfortable here--

246
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,209
I'm not forgetting, Arch.

247
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,719
You've done everything you
could to make me belong.

248
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,689
When you picked me up, I was
just a stray off, foul-mouthed,

249
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,819
and flea-bitten 15 years ago.

250
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,819
It's been a long
time, a good time.

251
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,375
Now, it's time for me to go.

252
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,294
You really mean it?

253
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,809
Well, I want to push
on try my own wings.

254
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:42,509
ARCH STROBIE: Owen,
how do I say this?

255
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,609
When I took you, it was for Lee.

256
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,309
I couldn't get around outside
and raise my own boys,

257
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,229
so I picked you to do it for me.

258
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,119
What I didn't know then
was that I needed you too.

259
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,395
I need you now.

260
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:04,892
All right, Arch.

261
00:14:08,735 --> 00:14:10,415
I was just hitting you
for a raise anyhow.

262
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,339
Night.

263
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,274
ARCH STROBIE: Night.

264
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,505
Jen, will you hurry
up and come on out?

265
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,409
I don't know why
all of a sudden you

266
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,819
can't get dressed
in front of me.

267
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,051
JEN STROBIE: I'll be
two more minutes, Lee.

268
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:30,489
The top of all winter,
that's a long time.

269
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,355
JEN STROBIE: I know
that better than you.

270
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,889
You mean you've missed me?

271
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,479
Of course.

273
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,089
You're beautiful.

274
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,669
Do you think so, Lee?

275
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,959
Do you really mean it?

276
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,689
The first time I saw
you, you were wearing

277
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,524
a pair of split britches.

278
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:09,529
And you helped me come out of
the back country, you and Arch.

279
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,389
This is the second Sunday
dress I ever owned, Lee.

280
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,029
First, when I wore to my
mother's funeral and then

281
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,279
I used it to bury my father.

282
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,304
And I branded.

283
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,975
And now, you're
a lady of fashion.

284
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,834

in "Godey's Lady's Book."

smart things in my life,

but marrying you is one of them.

00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,819

lost any sleep in so long.

you go to bed for.

better than the foreman.

All right.
I slept late.

out on the range all by himself

309
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,604
and eating his own
cooking, he looks forward

310
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:42,712
to getting up for breakfast?

311
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,081
Well, of course,
when he's home,

312
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,041
he lies there and has to
figure out if it's worth

that you've got to go hungry,

I could give you your
time before you know

Is the room here?

364
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:16,426
[music playing]

365
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:23,359
So you sent for him?

366
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,749
For reasons over there.

367
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,187
[music playing]

368
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:34,909
I didn't ask for you to come.

369
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,589
I didn't ask for you
to come, do you hear?

370
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,079
We're this kind of family.

371
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,119
We don't waste any
love on each other.

372
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,499
We fought amongst ourselves.

373
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,839
We've even shot at each other.

374
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,189
We got one tie.

375
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,479
We have blood relations.

376
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,389
Go away, Hub.

377
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,654
Go away.

378
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:56,059
Do you want to marry
Owen Daybright, Lily?

379
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,579
I don't want him
and I don't want you.

380
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,379
I'll manage myself
without any help.

381
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,866
[baby cooing, music playing]

382
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:19,649
Daybright knows something.

383
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,449
If he can't talk when
I get through with him,

384
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,889
he'll write the
name with his feet.

385
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,300
[music playing, baby cooing]

386
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,730

[neighing violently]

388
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:59,749
Ride him.

389
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,749
Scratch him, boy.

390
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,210
[neighing]

391
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,244
Hey, Mr. Kicker,
you dropped something.

392
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:16,750
What he means now
is that fourth ace.

393
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,679
You know that's no
way to break a horse.

394
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,153
Now, get on him and ride
him like you were taught.

395
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:39,598

[cheers]

400
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,109
That's it, boy!

401
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,110
Hang on.

402
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,319
Did you have to use that whip?

403
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,329
Oh, it's touchy.

404
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,979
Stop being such a farmer.

405
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,669
A good whipping
never hurt any filly.

406
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,670
Come on.

407
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,469
All those
authorizations come in?

408
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,659
All but Mrs. Burke's.

409
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
I'll ride over.

410
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,019
Cut me a horse, you.

411
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
And one for yourself.

412
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,499
Hi, Lily.

413
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,869
Hello, Owen.

414
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,559
Hello, Hewie.

415
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Good day, ma'am.

416
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,659
How do you feel?

417
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,209
Feel good.

418
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,499
Why?

419
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,509
I just wondered.

420
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,370
[moos]

421
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,859
That's mighty good to hear.

422
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Well, thank you.

423
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,309
Well, I just ask because--

424
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,990
because you look
real fine, Lily.

425
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:48,845
Just fine.

426
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,779
Had your breakfast?

427
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,069
Mr. Willoughby's best.

428
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,069
I can outcook him
with my two arms broken.

429
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,559
Business first, then
we'll trade recipes.

430
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,839
Write me a note authorizing
us to cut out your cattle

431
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,369
at roundup and bring them home.

432
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,169
Been wondering if
I was being snubbed.

433
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,839
The only thing could
snub you is a mountain.

434
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,130
I'll get paper and pen.

435
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,679
Thanks, Owen.

436
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,699
But I'm all right again.

437
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,199
You look fine, Lily.

438
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,595
Yeah, that's what Hewie says.

439
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,739
I wish I could find
the words to thank

440
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,059
you for bringing me the money.

441
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,109
But I can't.

442
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,659
Well, don't try.

443
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,719
I hate to see you
fronting for Lee.

444
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,399
Well, I'm--

445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,689
I'm thinking of Arch.

446
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,739
I know.

447
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,479
You go on standing
in front of Lee,

448
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,379
protecting him, letting
his dirt rub off on you.

449
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,489
Maybe.

450
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,469
I'm thinking of Jen.

451
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,939
And all she's done for me.

452
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,789
That's why I can't tell.

453
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,829
So we'll both keep it a secret.

454
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,829
Lily, it ain't right.

455
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,324
Owen, I've been afraid of a
lot of things this past winter.

456
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:11,069
What people would say about me.

457
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,429
How I'd raise a baby.

458
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,709
How I'd keep us both alive.

459
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,209
Well, now it's happened.

460
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,679
I'm not afraid anymore.

461
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,819
I'm not glad it happened.

462
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,080
I was wrong, I know that.

463
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,419
I'm just not afraid
of living anymore.

464
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,150
[sinister music]

465
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,569
Daybright here?

466
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,570
In the house.

467
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,229
Start walking to
that shed over there.

468
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,229
Why?

469
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,839
You won't get hurt if you
don't break for the house.

470
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Go on.

471
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,189
What is this?

472
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,189
You bought your ticket.

473
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,189
You'll see.

474
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,358
Sit down.

475
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,339

476
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,619
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: Goodbye, ladies.

477
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,640
See you after rondo.

HUB FASKEN: Daybright.

479
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,230
So you sent for big brother.

480
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,319
Why don't I remind
myself to pack

481
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,199
a gun when I visit my neighbor?

482
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,699
That money was
yours, Daybright.

483
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,989
Oh, it was, huh?

484
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,549
That baby's going
to need a name.

485
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,859
Yours.

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,860
[crashes]

487
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,260
You want another helping?

488
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,029
Well, come on.

489
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,579
Pull the trigger.

490
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,659
First you shoot me, and
then you got to shoot Hewie,

491
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,679
because he saw you.

492
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,919
Then you'll have to shoot
Mrs. Burke and your own sister

493
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,879
because they'll see you.

494
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,339
Well, come on.
Pull the trigger!

495
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,339
Quit it, Owen.

496
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,339
He'll do it!

497
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,901
I don't think
he's got the guts.

498
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:20,399
[clangs]

499
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,779
Put that down.

500
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,129
That gun down, big brother.

501
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,719
You won't use it.

502
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,279
And I'll break your
arm if you keep it.

503
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,773
[scuffle sounds]

00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,639
Get up, Hub!

507
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,799
Dick, put that gun down.

508
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,239
Well go ahead.
Cut down on her.

509
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,239
She's only your sister.

510
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,599
You got to kill somebody.

511
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,229
Be careful who you
poke in the belly.

512
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,019
Hewie, that's enough.

513
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,369
Whatever you say, Lily.

514
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,369
All right, Hub.

515
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,379
This is still our dance.

516
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,719
No, Owen!

517
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,549
Haven't I made enough
trouble for myself?

518
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,869
For my baby?

519
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,579
You want to add murder, too?

520
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,169
Go on, take them to the sheriff.

521
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,480
If you need someone to sign
the complaint, I'll do it.

522
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,799
All right, Lily.

523
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,319
You got the right.

524
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Come on.

525
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,150
Go on.

526
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,729
I hear the Lazy W's for sale.

527
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,869
How much?

528
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,509
They're asking
$35,000 cash for it.

529
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,749
That reminds me, you
owe me some money.

530
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,009
I generally do, Arch.

531
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,719
Joe Benson told me
yesterday at the bank

532
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,359
that you were overdrawn.

533
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,359
Don't worry.

534
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,829
The old man covered it for you.

535
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,829
Thanks.

536
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,889
Still trying to fill
those inside straights, huh?

537
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,449
I always forget
what you told me.

538
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,449
Hey.

539
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,209
Have you been
spending our money?

540
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,849
You know, that's
a joint account.

541
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,079
How much did he draw?

542
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,819
$500.

543
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,279
Said you drew it in gold.

544
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,279

545
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,549
Makes a nice clink
in the pocket a bit.

546
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,609
I'll see you later.

547
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,219
I've got to get ready for work.

548
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,419
Is there some cream there?

549
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
Jam?

550
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Excuse me.

551
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,519
You don't believe that
story about the $500, do you?

552
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,939
No, I don't.

553
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,659
Well, look, honey,
there's certain things

554
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,469
that you've got to understand.

555
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,807
I don't like Arch knowing
everything that's going on.

556
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:56,639
Yes.

557
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,509
And I can understand your
not wanting him to know.

558
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,939
That $500 is a lot of money.

559
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,979
I didn't like taking it
out of the account, either.

560
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,049
But well, it-- it was
for a lady's honor.

561
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,049
Stop it, Lee.

562
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,049
Stop it.

563
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,480
I know all about you and Lily.

564
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,999
Oh.

565
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,889
I know what you're thinking.

566
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,359
Oh, honey.

567
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,419
That $500 was to help Owen out.

568
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,809
I don't want Arch or anybody
else to know about it.

569
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,969
But now that the
fat's in the fire,

570
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,279
I guess I'll have to
tell you the truth.

571
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,689
You see, Owen got in
trouble with Lilly.

572
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:38,014
And the least I could
do to help him was--

573
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:40,489
well, you know how
much I think of Owen.

574
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,279
The least I could do to help
him was to give him the money.

575
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,049
You're a liar.

576
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,127
You're a mean,
contemptible liar.

577
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,128
[smacks]

578
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:04,165
Hey.

579
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,099
You're all alike.

580
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,169
You and Arch and Lee.

581
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,169
You could be a little--

582
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,549
You're all a pack of liars.

583
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,689
Well, I'm through.

584
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,339
I'm leaving.

585
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,479
Slow down to a walk.

586
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,309
That $500 you gave Lily.

587
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,519
I know where it came from.

588
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,559
Now, wait a minute, Jen.

589
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,759
Protecting him again.

590
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,679
Fighting with Lily's brothers.

591
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,809
You've known all about her
and Lee from the start.

592
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,009
It's just a lot of talk.

593
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,069
I'd pay it no mind.

594
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,169
Owen.

595
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,850
Why can't you be your own man?

596
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,349
These
misunderstandings happen.

597
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,629
All married people have a
quarrel once in a while,

598
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,159
I guess.

599
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,129
I hate him.

600
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,130
Jen.

601
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,729
You and I are kind
of in the same fix.

602
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,529
Arch is all the family we got.

603
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,044
With him, we belong
to something.

604
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,045
Shouldn't we give him back
a little bit in return?

605
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,869
Owen, what can I do?

606
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,699
What can I do?

607
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,174
Stay around.

608
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:11,175
For Arch.

609
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,499
All right.

610
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,715
But all I'll do is stay.

611
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:29,620
[clanging]

612
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,850
Morning, Mr. Ticker.

613
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,309
Hey.

614
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,489
Hey, Owen.

615
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,199
What fell on you?

616
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,199
A couple of hard cases.

617
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,199
Brothers.

618
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,269
Name of Fasken.

619
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,270
Fasken?

620
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,719
Two of them?

621
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,100
Lily's clan is gathering.

622
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,139
Do they know?

623
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,249
They're still alive.

624
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,679
Do you they'll find out?

625
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,809
Well, not for a while.

626
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,109
The Sheriff's got
them locked up.

627
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,189
How long?

628
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,190
Week.

629
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,809
He'll try again.

630
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,129
We'll tell them.

631
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,629
Well, Lily might.

632
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,109
She doesn't want to, but
they're kind of hard to handle.

633
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,689
Well, what do I do?

634
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,459
You wouldn't do it.

635
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,039
Let's see.

636
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,339
There's only one way.

637
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,519
Take Jen and get out.

638
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,519
Stay away from here.

639
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,629
Begin all over again.

640
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,309
Because you've worn
this place out and all

641
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,199
your friends are with it.

642
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,279
Sure.

643
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,249
It's either that or get shot.

644
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,849
With me gone,
the ranch is yours.

645
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:45,850
[smacks]

646
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,769
Nobody can stop
you thinking that.

647
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,159
But don't say it to me.

648
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
All right?

649
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,264
Picture?

650
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:04,105
One day, you definitely
want once too often.

651
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,829
Now, you boys are going
out on a big round-up.

652
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,319
If you ride with a short
or underfed string,

653
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,999
you might as well be afoot.

654
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,709
Now here's a horse
you can have cheap.

655
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,959
A real Saturday
afternoon bargain.

656
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,318
Sound of limb and body.

657
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:21,678
Rune, he's been
burned so often,

658
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,089
he looks like a brand book.

659
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,309
Just give me an offer.

660
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,378
I make out about 12 brands.
What do you say, Lee?

661
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,698
Oh, I'd say a
good round dozen.

662
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,549
That means 12
unhappy customers.

663
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,549
Oh, Rune.

664
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,158
I pass.
- All right.

665
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,158
Anybody else?

666
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,178
Take him away.

667
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,158
- Put him out to grass.
- Let's see him fed.

668
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,178
All right, all right.

669
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,839
I got the best tow horses
this side of K State.

670
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,238
I got a pedigree
comes with this one.

671
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,468
Name your price.

672
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,279
Well, this looks more like it.

673
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,319
Here, let me check.

674
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
Open the gate, boys.

675
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,132
[neighs]

676
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,379
[wheezing]

677
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,729
Good horse, Rune.

678
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,409
Only trouble is he's a whistler.

679
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,729
He leaks air!

680
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,579
Call that a leak?

681
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,479
[laughs]

682
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,759
Owen, you know better than
to ride a horse that way

683
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,109
through town on Saturday.

684
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,139
That team of Wilsons took
after you and almost ran away.

685
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,819
Well, don't blame me.
Blame the horse.

686
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,319
He whistles, and
everything follows.

687
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,519
[laughter]

688
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,529
Hey, hold on.

689
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,739
I ain't through yet!

690
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,049
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: You sure are.

691
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,389
Can't you hold
your breath a minute?

692
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,649
Put him away.

693
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,649
Oh.

694
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,075
[laughter]

695
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,319
I wonder if the Fasken
boys are comfortable.

696
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,699
Who cares?

697
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,780
Let's go look in on them.

698
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,620
Pick me up later
at the saloon.

699
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,319
Oh, Owen.

700
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,609
How are things?

701
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,959
Quiet, Con.

702
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,159
Getting ready for a round-up.

703
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,209
Tough job.

704
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,349
How'd you like to sign on?

705
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,639
30 a month in meals.

706
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,319
Oh, not me.

707
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,809
I sleep in a soft
bed every night.

708
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,929
Help you?

709
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,074
I'm bringing the
Fasken some cookies.

710
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:37,329
Better push them into
their cage with a stick.

711
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,770
They're a troublesome pair.

712
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,619
One inside?

713
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,620
Might be catching.

714
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,059
I understand the judge
gave you boys a week.

715
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,229
Judge?

716
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,299
A stinking justice of the peace.

717
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,479
Well maybe next time we
can arrange a real judge.

718
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,289
Claw, hammer, coat, and all.

719
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,730
Next time will be different.

720
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
Look.

721
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,389
Lily's doing all right
without you boys.

722
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,549
Why don't you leave her alone?

723
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,439
I don't see no Mrs.
in front of her name.

724
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,999
Well, that happens.

725
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,459
Not to a sister of ours.

726
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,139
All right, act like
jackasses and you'll

727
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,459
be treated like them.

728
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,819
When you get out,
the Sheriff will

729
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,579
put you on the train himself.

730
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,859
Show your faces after
that and you'll be back,

731
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,889
right here, for six months.

732
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,890
You scare me.

733
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,009
Just say the
word and I'll order

734
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,170
some curtains for this place.

735
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,399
By the way, I've decided
to go on a round-up with you.

736
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,399
Not so easy, Lee.

737
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,489
There's some things and some
people you can't run away from.

738
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,329
Well, I'll think about
that when I get back.

739
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,689
You ought to
think about it now.

740
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,819
Hold it.

741
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,639
There's a Cheyenne in that tree.

742
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
[gunshot]

743
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,739
Got him.

744
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,479
Hey, that thing
jumped in your hand.

745
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,559
How did you get it so fast?

746
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,559
Practice, son.

747
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,719
You ought to try it.

748
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,219
Haven't got the time.

749
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,759
Lee, the old Cheyenne camp.

750
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,839
Yeah.

751
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,029
Remember the night we rolled
the rocks down on them?

752
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,359
I remember when Arch caught
us and the licking we got.

753
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,079
I'd sooner been
scarred by the Cheyennes.

754
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,449
A couple of fool kids
playing with Indians.

755
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,386
We had our times, didn't we?

756
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:28,878
[gunshots]

757
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,149
Good morning, Arch.

758
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,249
Good morning, Lee.

759
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,569
Good morning.

760
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,569
Phew.

761
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,509
I'm getting too fat.

762
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,829
Well, did you buy
any horses yesterday?

763
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,819
Well, Obie Rune tried to push
a wind-broke gelding off on us,

764
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,559
but Owen caught him up.

765
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,379
Obie never quits trying.

766
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,459
All right, you know I got
the thinking last night.

767
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,459
Come on.

768
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,479
Tell me why you were walking.

769
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,479
Come on, walk with me.

770
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Walk with me.

771
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,119
What started me thinking
was that I saw a horse

772
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,679
in Rune's that I'd like to own.

773
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,449
And I'd begun talking
about price before I

774
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,619
remembered that I'm strapped.

775
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,619
Buy him.

776
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,090
We always got money
for a good horse.

777
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,490
Oh, I don't care
about the horse.

778
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:50,739
I probably own too many.

779
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,739
No, Arch.

780
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,179
The point is that a man my age
with a wife with a father who

781
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,579
owns half the county
has to hold off

782
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,309
buying a horse because his
wages won't let him afford it.

783
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,689
Oh, listen, Lee.

784
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,579
You haven't been
able to trust me.

785
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,049
Now that's in the past, Arch.

786
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,419
You were right, but it's done.

787
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,219
I've been a good hand
this winter, haven't I?

788
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,449
Yes, you have.

789
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,009
You think I know
the cattle business?

790
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,719
Maybe not as well
as you or Owen,

791
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,399
but well enough to
make money at it, huh?

792
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,439
Of course, if you need
more money, you'll get it.

793
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,329
Let me tell you.

794
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,889
When you came home
with Jen last fall,

795
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,689
I thought it was another
piece of foolishness

796
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,689
like all the others.

797
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,089
It wasn't.

798
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,259
Jen was something else.

799
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,179
Something right.

800
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,979
That's why I put you on
the top hand's wages.

801
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,659
I'll raise them.

802
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,209
Oh, that's too easy.

803
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,909
Either I'm your son,
entitled to your trust

804
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,879
with the ranch or
anything else, or I'm not.

805
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,029
It's one or the other.

806
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,899
What do you want?

807
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,449
I want to be part
owner of the ranch, Arch.

808
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,189
I want a share in it.

809
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,439
I'm married and
settled down now.

810
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,829
Why, here is where I'll live
and raise my kids and die.

811
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,089
Here's where I'll help take
over from you when you've--

812
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,129
had enough of the business.

813
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,529
I'm not just camping
here for wages.

814
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,509
I'm here to stay, Arch.

815
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,679
I'm your son.

816
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,079
I've been thinking
about it, too.

817
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,079
More than you.

818
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,899
A lot more than you.

819
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,099
You're my own blood.

820
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,509
Man has a debt to that.

821
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,819
Oh, you got no
debt to me, Arch.

822
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,139
Yeah?

823
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,659
It's an old one.

824
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,009
Began the day your mother died.

825
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,719
You got it coming to you, Lee.

826
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,309
For doing without her.

827
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,589
Well, we've
managed, old timer.

828
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,929
Beginning to feel like one.

829
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,669
I'll go in town tomorrow
and draw up the papers.

830
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,149
From now on, half
the ranch is yours.

831
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,409
Oh.

832
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,419
My half will go
to Owen when I die.

833
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,570
[chuckles]

834
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,569
Hamilton.

835
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,849
Flying H.

836
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,849
Neely.

837
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,779
Dog Iron.

838
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,779
Sans.

839
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,299
Lazy S Double-O.

840
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,299
Frank Peter.

841
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,939
Box Pitchfork.

842
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,159
Frank Martin.

843
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,159
Let's see.

844
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,179
Box F.

845
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,179
Double F.

846
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,179
That's right, Double F.

847
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,779
What are you carrying
them in your head for?

848
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,949
Well, you got 40
different brands.

849
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,269
The biggest shuffle
you ever saw.

850
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,269
We'll have to move fast.

851
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,429
Talk to you a minute, Owen?

852
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,429
Sure.

853
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,589
Go ahead, Hewie.

854
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,359
I was back up in the
mountains yesterday

855
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,489
looking for the
last of the horses.

856
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,209
Well, we finished
the tally this morning.

857
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,209
They're all in.

858
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,659
There was a small jag
of our cattle up there.

859
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,189
Brands are still
haired over, but I

860
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,508
could tell that it was ours.

861
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:21,789
Couldn't stop because I was
trying to turn the horses in.

862
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,249
By the time we got them headed
downhill, I was miles away.

863
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,929
Do you want to
pick them up today?

864
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,579
Well, I aimed to this morning.

865
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,049
They're gone.

866
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,599
They've probably been rounded
up by the other crew already.

867
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,309
Nope, they was
drove the other way.

868
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,599
Did you trail 'em?

869
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,849
As far as I could.

870
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,139
Let's go try again, Hewie.

871
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,489
I'll come with you.

872
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,709
Dust up and get my gun, Hewie.

873
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,710
Better get Owen's, too.

874
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,249
Take a look at this shoe.

875
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,100
You see the two clocks on the
inside, how it's built up?

876
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,940
This rider signed
his name for us.

877
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,929
Two horses and four steers.

878
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,580
These tracks go
straight for a while.

879
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,889
Got dark on me here
and I turned back.

880
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,449
Good place to cross.

881
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,679
If they want to cross.

882
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,714
You think like
a cattle rustler.

883
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:40,875
Let's look on the other side.

884
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:47,004
[splashing]

885
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,300
Only one horse came
out of the water here.

886
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,429
I was right, this
horse is a decoy.

887
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,989
They either went
up or down stream.

888
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,044
Hewie, you look below.

889
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,045
Yeah.

890
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,479
There ain't even been
a horse down this way.

891
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,799
There has been here.

892
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,840
And they've been driving
some steers ahead of them.

893
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,140
Here's where they come out.

894
00:44:57,217 --> 00:44:58,529
It's Herb Backett's place.

895
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,529
Yeah.

896
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,810
Let's go over and have a look.

897
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,339
Here he comes.

898
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,340
Two of them.

899
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,649
You looking for something?

900
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,073
Four steers.

901
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:38,019
Well, they ain't in
that watering trough.

902
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,420
Their ears would stick up.

903
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:41,421
Come here, mean.

904
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,909
Notice that core.

905
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,519
They built up
inside of that shoe.

906
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,089
Who owns the horse
that wears them?

907
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,130
Never seen it before.

908
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,879
There's another one.

909
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,880
It's fresh.

910
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,039
[creaks]

911
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,329
What about it, Herb?

912
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:23,669
What about what?

913
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,259
Whoever rode that horse drove
four of our steers in here.

914
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,429
Look, if you see your
steers here, you can talk.

915
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,989
If not, I ain't accountable.

916
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,869
Get on your horse
and get out of here.

917
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,589
Everybody figure you
butchered their beef

918
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,759
and buried the hides,
but I can't prove it.

919
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,939
So I'm going to do
the next best thing.

920
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,749
I'm going to show you what
you buy into every time I

921
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,750
track our cattle here.

922
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,470
[gunshot]

923
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,819
[heavy breathing]

924
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,939
I always heard you were a pretty
good saloon fighter, Herb.

925
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,849
How are you without
a bottle or a knife?

926
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:13,315
[fight sounds]

927
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,225
[crashes]

928
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,119
Now we're going to take
four of your steers.

929
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,199
You licked him.

930
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,329
Why go to jail for
stealing his cattle?

931
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,579
You talking as
the new half owner?

932
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,779
You got a round-up to go to.

933
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,315
So have I. How are we going
to make it if we're in jail?

934
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,649
You coming, Hewie?

935
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:01,650
You're still foreman.

936
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,469
You're going to keep me
from going to the Sheriff?

937
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,059
Think back aways, Herb.

938
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,949
Did I put a gun on you?

939
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,889
Did I shoot the knife
out of your hand?

940
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:42,279
Am I driving off your steers?

941
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,540
I got no part of this.

942
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,959
He's your foreman.

943
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,499
Sad, but true.

944
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,689
Put a good price
on your beef, Herb.

945
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,189
You can't buy me off.

946
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,629
Don't try.

947
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,909
It wasn't a $250
beating, was it?

948
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,699
All right.

949
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,469
It's a deal.

950
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,369
But I ain't done with him yet.

951
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,360
Long as I can look down a gun
barrel, I ain't done with him.

952
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,959
Come on into town with me.

953
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,174
I'll get you the money.

954
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:19,359
I can't sit a horse
till I get this hand fixed

955
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,127
and get a drink.

956
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,502
[cheerful music]

957
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,819
Ain't you dancing
tonight, son?

958
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,919
I'm drinking tonight,
Mr. Willoughby.

959
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,129
Careful that applejack
don't put your lights out.

960
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,599
Seen Owen?

961
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,719
Start bleeding again.

962
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,760
Jen took him to the house.

963
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,399
Too tight?

964
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,369
The tighter, the better.

965
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,009
You seem to be getting
a lot of trouble lately.

966
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,119
Trouble?

967
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,249
You don't have to, you know.

968
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,079
You can stop them from
saying those things

969
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,179
about you and Lily.

970
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,269
Oh, I don't mind.

971
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:19,529
I happen to like Lily.

972
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,159
There.

973
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,629
Here, let me help you.

974
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:25,630
Thanks, Jen.

975
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,429
Owen.

976
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,999
You can't make it up
to Lily by yourself.

977
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,360
If Lee was half a man and--

978
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,210
I want to see Jen alone.

979
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,399
Wait, Owen.

980
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,449
Stay.

981
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,869
What do you want?

982
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,309
I'm leaving in
the morning, honey.

983
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,109
Big round-up.

984
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,379
I'll be gone a long time.

985
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,619
I know that.

986
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,749
Well, I've got to
say goodbye, don't I?

987
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,209
Well, goodbye, then.

988
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,209
Oh, no.

989
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,119
Not like that.

990
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,469
Not anymore.

991
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,470
Leave me alone.

992
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,649
Oh.

993
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,209
It's easy enough to lock one man
out as long as there's somebody

994
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,349
else to take his place, huh?

995
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,549
You're drunk, Lee.

996
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,139
Drunk enough to see double.

997
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,415
To see you here with Jen!

998
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:38,890
JEN STROBIE: I'm sorry
you had to see that.

999
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:46,249
I wish I could help you.

1000
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,470
Just knowing
you're around helps.

1001
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:57,729
There are things
I'd like to say.

1002
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,810
What would you say, Owen?

1003
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,849
I'd say I haven't
got the right to help.

1004
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:09,870
I'd say it's too bad.

1005
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,343
[thrilling music]

1006
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:39,810
[knocks]

1007
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,979
What do you want?

1008
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,249
I want to talk to you.

1009
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,109
How's the hand?

1010
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,339
Still sore.

1011
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,339
Sit down.

1012
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,129
Still sore, huh?

1013
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,929
I guess you don't have
much love for Daybright.

1014
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,030
Man's time will come.

1015
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,349
I hear the Fasken boys are
getting out of jail soon.

1016
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,749
So I hear.

1017
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,679
And they'll still
be looking for Papa.

1018
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,329
I got them figured.

1019
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,209
Daybright will be dead
in another few days.

1020
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,209
No.

1021
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,889
He'll be gone.

1022
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,239
The round-up?

1023
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,859
That ain't going to be
hard for him to find.

1024
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,139
Oh, a couple of saddle tramps
like them would be picked

1025
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,250
up in no time at round-up.

1026
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,099
In order for them
to join, they'll

1027
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,619
have to have a letter
of authorization

1028
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,349
from some well-known brand.

1029
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,089
Like yours, say.

1030
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,069
Daybright'll try
to keep them out.

1031
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,009
Sure he will, if they try
to join the Western Division.

1032
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,909
But if they ride to the Eastern
Division, present your letter,

1033
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,529
they can get in.

1034
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,029
I'll be with the Eastern.

1035
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:46,959
Likely his wagon captain.

1036
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,059
East and West Divisions
meet, don't they,

1037
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,749
to finish up the roundup?

1038
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,189
Yeah.

1039
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,833
To finish up.

1040
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:00,389
You know, Herb, I should have
made that check much bigger.

1041
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,759
That was a bad beating you took.

1042
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,349
Yeah.

1043
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,540
An awful beating.

1044
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:09,790
Jones, Western.

1045
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:16,569
Hewie, you're with me.

1046
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,559
Stu Miller, Western.

1047
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,560
Orv, you're Eastern.

1048
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,249
Hung over?

1049
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,250
LEE STROBIE: I feel fine.

1050
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,609
How'd you make out
with Backett yesterday?

1051
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,809
I bought the steers.

1052
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:36,809
Good price?

1053
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,319
$250.

1054
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,869
Just for cattle?

1055
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:41,870
Yeah.

1056
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,019
I've decided to take
your advice, Owen.

1057
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,319
I'm getting out of the
country after this round-up.

1058
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,199
You, starting all over again?

1059
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,199
Working for a living?

1060
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,259
Yeah, just like that.

1061
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,149
What about Jen?

1062
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,709
I'll send for
her when I'm ready.

1063
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:01,820
She'll join me.

1064
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,639
NARRATOR: Was a nice
morning the day we left.

1065
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,409
The sun warm on your shoulders.

1066
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,069
But we didn't feel good.

1067
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,109
This time, there was
something under your wishbone

1068
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,400
that said we were in for grief.

1069
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,029
Seems like they
were just coming

1070
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,199
home from the winter drift.

1071
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,949
We turn around,
they're off again.

1072
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,709
How do you feel about
another month with me?

1073
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,539
Scare you?

1074
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,089
You'll wait for
him alone this time.

1075
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,229
What's wrong, Jen?

1076
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,139
Something to do with Lee?

1077
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,749
I can't talk about it, Arch.

1078
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,699
Sounds final.

1079
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,700
It is final.

1080
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,509
I was going to leave
without telling you.

1081
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,129
Where are you, Jen?

1082
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,409
Can't I help you?

1083
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:56,109
You can't always
make it up for him.

1084
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:59,609
I always have, till now.

1085
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:01,379
That's part of the trouble.

1086
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:06,029
Look, maybe it's my fault. Maybe
it never could have worked.

1087
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,259
I'm restless here.

1088
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,279
I've been alone so
long, I'm used to it.

1089
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,599
We've never lied
to each other.

1090
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,519
We don't have to start now.

1091
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,710
Are you running away from
Owen because he loves you?

1092
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,839
You're a good woman, Jen.

1093
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,849
Your life should be
rich and peaceful.

1094
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,859
But if you run away
from it now, you

1095
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,399
will spend what's left with
bitter memories of the house.

1096
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,510
Wait till they get back.

1097
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:36,319
That's something
like what Owen said.

1098
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,520
It's good advice, Jen.

1099
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,679
NARRATOR: The spring
round-up is a cow hunt.

1100
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,089
In the winter, they drift.

1101
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,629
The aim is to get them
back to the home range.

1102
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,989
Besides that,
there's the calves.

1103
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,480
Make a tally, brand,
crop, and dehorn.

1104
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,799
I was with Owen in
the Western Division.

1105
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,589
We worked hard, and
the hours were long.

1106
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,239
You didn't measure
time by the day,

1107
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,599
but by the greening
of the grass.

1108
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,240
It was all planned well and
the work went even smooth.

1109
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:38,340
[ringing]

1110
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,259
Get on.

1111
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,889
- What about our guns?
- Get inside.

1112
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,409
I'll throw them
in the back platform

1113
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,539
after the train starts.

1114
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,669
You were going to
kill a man, remember?

1115
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:59,719
I ain't through yet.

1116
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,359
- Next visit?
- That's right.

1117
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,360
Now I'm worried.

1118
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:08,264
[honks]

1119
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:13,184
[horn blows]

1120
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,179
Sheriff tell you to stay out?

1121
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,529
What do you want?

1122
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:38,819
Being neighborly.

1123
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,399
Help you find the man you're
looking for, Daybright.

1124
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,149
Why do you care?

1125
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,799
I run a business.

1126
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,299
It's the business
of moving cattle

1127
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,159
fast over long distances.

1128
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,069
Mostly in rainy
weather and at night.

1129
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,759
Daybright bothers me.

1130
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,549
Well, why don't you
level on him, then?

1131
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,349
That shouldn't bother
a man like you.

1132
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,419
And hang?

1133
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,419
No.

1134
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,289
I'm looking for someone to
shoot him who's got a right to.

1135
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,069
You found him.

1136
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,629
Here's the setup.

1137
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:07,129
Daybright's on round-up.

1138
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,079
I can get you into it legally.

1139
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,689
Once you're there, you'll
have no trouble finding him.

1140
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,529
Go on.

1141
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,929
When this train hits
the top of Bench Grade,

1142
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,969
it'll be slowed to a walk.

1143
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,409
We get off there.

1144
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:22,229
I got three horses waiting.

1145
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:24,089
Daybright would sure
be surprised to see us.

1146
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,679
Yeah.

1147
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,013
Come on, here we are.

1148
00:59:27,014 --> 00:59:30,472
[sinister music]

1149
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,419
NARRATOR: On the other
side of the mountain,

1150
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,815
Lee was with the
Eastern Division.

1151
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:10,572
Orv.

1152
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,849
Cut out all of our brand.

1153
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:17,849
It's local.

1154
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,339
Turn them over to
Mr. Jenkins here.

1155
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,340
Right.

1156
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,077
Get out too far.

1157
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,249
Get out too far.

1158
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:40,730
[cattle mooing]

1159
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:07,676
[mooing]

1160
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Lee!

1161
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:23,890
Referee that brand.

1162
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,109
- I read O bar.
- I take it back.

1163
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,659
It looked like mine.
- Satisfied?

1164
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,659
Satisfied.

1165
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,660
He's yours, Jenkins.

1166
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,439
What brand?

1167
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,399
O bar.

1168
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,400
See that pair with a
pack horse behind Hardison?

1169
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:11,929
They brought this.

1170
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,850
Claim to represent
an outfit near you.

1171
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,699
Yeah.

1172
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,219
They're from our part.

1173
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,229
Know these two riders?

1174
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,759
Yeah I've seen them.

1175
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,319
All right, I'll
assign to your wagon.

1176
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,159
No, no.

1177
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,719
Some of the boys
having a very friendly

1178
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,889
feeling for that brand.

1179
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,269
Well, if they're wrong ones,
I'll send them whistling.

1180
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,309
Well, you can't do that.

1181
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,229
They got a right to their stock.

1182
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,879
We'll keep a close look out
of the stuff they cut out.

1183
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,639
Meanwhile, assign
them to another wagon.

1184
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,109
Somebody who doesn't know 'em.

1185
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,519
I don't want them around me.

1186
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,630
Well, that's fair enough.

1187
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:58,019
NARRATOR: In Lee's division,
work was the same as ours.

1188
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,219
They'd make the combings,
snake them out of the draws,

1189
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,990
gather them, push them
toward the middle.

1190
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:27,469
Hey.

1191
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,239
First of our stock we've seen.

1192
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,249
Yeah, they really wintered.

1193
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,869
Heavier than anything
on the home range.

1194
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,309
Yeah.

1195
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,609
Looks like a bonus
for all hands.

1196
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,399
Arch, you'll be a rich man.

1197
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,749
So will you.

1198
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,239
You're a partner now, ain't you?

1199
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,239
That's right.

1200
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,833
I was forgetting.

1201
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,799
Well, I got a half of
summer's work laid out.

1202
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,579
I'm heading for
Texas to restock.

1203
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,459
How are you going to
get your beef from Texas

1204
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,049
all the way home to Montana?

1205
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,819
Yeah, by the time
you buy your herd,

1206
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,949
Kansas will come up with
some new kind of fever

1207
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:04,209
and quarantine you out.

1208
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,569
If you move to New Mexico,
the same thing will happen.

1209
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,639
I reckon you'll just have
to stay put in Texas,

1210
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,899
and that's no life.

1211
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,599
Now, son, you must
have heard of railroads.

1212
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,389
I'm just going to lock my
herd up in airtight boxcars,

1213
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:18,879
put a bag of that clean
Texas air in each car,

1214
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,259
and unload in Montana.

1215
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,733
[laughs]

1216
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,709
Sir, my name is Strobie.

1217
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,029
I don't think I got your name.

1218
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,139
Oh, Dave Allard.

1219
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,919
I gathered you're
sending your crew back

1220
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,399
to Montana with your
strays while you

1221
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,569
head for Texas to restock.

1222
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:39,569
That's right.

1223
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,389
Well, I can save
you the trouble.

1224
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:43,879
I'll have 3,000 double
wintered steers for sale

1225
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,675
at the end of round-up.

1226
01:04:45,676 --> 01:04:47,119
[whistles]

1227
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,299
In good shape?

1228
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,699
You're picking
them up every day.

1229
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:50,699
Look at them.

1230
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,209
They've got our brand.

1231
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,379
What price?

1232
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,759
14.

1233
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,429
Laid down at Wet
Mountain Meadow.

1234
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,430
14.

1235
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,319
You just made a deal.

1236
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,629
I'll have to find the
nearest telegraph station.

1237
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:08,049
And it'll take a few days till
I can cover a check for $42,000.

1238
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:09,259
That's all right.

1239
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:12,760
[sweeping music]

1240
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,349
Here's some hot coffee.

1241
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,999
Well, thanks, Mr. Willoughby.

1242
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,529
Why don't I save
my money and buy

1243
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,509
a nice warm store I can sit in?

1244
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:53,739
I've seen them stores.

1245
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,759
They're drafty.

1246
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:55,959

1247
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Sure does.

1248
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,009
Come on in out of
the weather, friend.

1249
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:04,139
What are you, East
or West Division?

1250
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,939
West.

1251
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:06,959
Name's Allard.

1252
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,959
Daybright.

1253
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,959
Thanks.

1254
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,259
I needed this.

1255
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,489
I need a horse, too.

1256
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:13,049
I wanted to ride
on through tonight.

1257
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,129
Mine's beat.

1258
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,420
Hewie, get the man a horse.

1259
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:20,249
Where are you headed for?

1260
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,139
I left the East
Division for a few days.

1261
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:23,489
I'm looking for a telegraph.

1262
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:25,739
Missed it in the rain, huh?

1263
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,149
Man can miss anything in this.

1264
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:28,829
I don't know whether
I'm drowned or not.

1265
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:30,079
[chuckles]

1266
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,679
Well, there's a
telegraph at our meeting

1267
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,269
place, the Wet Mountain Meadow.

1268
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:37,679
Hewie, change the man's saddle
while he finishes his coffee.

1269
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,835
Say, is that your brand?

1270
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:44,289
That's right.

1271
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,129
I just bought your herd.

1272
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,769
That's why I was
looking for a telegraph,

1273
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,839
to get my credit
and shape by wire.

1274
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,069
Bought?

1275
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,679
You must be mistaken, Mister.

1276
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,419
Strobie own the brand?

1277
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,589
Yeah.

1278
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,759
That's it.

1279
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,445
3,000 double winter steers
delivered at the meeting place.

1280
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,059
Strobie's the owner, ain't he?

1281
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,729
He can sell them?

1282
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,179
There anything wrong?

1283
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,179
Not a thing, friend.

1284
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,180
Not a thing.

1285
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,280
Well, thanks for everything.

1286
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,699
I didn't think he could
plan that far ahead.

1287
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,189
You reckon that's why Lee
made his bid to be partner?

1288
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,359
That's why.

1289
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,899
Sell the beef and get
the money to clear out.

1290
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,190
What's he running from?

1291
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,799
There's people he
has to answer to.

1292
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,876
You always stand up
for him, don't you, Owen?

1293
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,739
When you're loyal
to a man, Hewie,

1294
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:12,219
you're loyal to
everything about him.

1295
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,849
Even his faults.

1296
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:14,850
Even his son.

1297
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,709
It's funny what you
just said about Arch.

1298
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:23,455
I've been feeling that way a
long time about somebody else.

1299
01:08:26,984 --> 01:08:27,984
About Lily.

1300
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:37,712
[music playing]

1301
01:08:58,587 --> 01:09:00,078
[mooing]

1302
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,148
NARRATOR: Day by day
and hour by hour,

1303
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:34,108
the two divisions
pushed closer together.

1304
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:36,274
So did Owen and Lee
for the showdown.

1305
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,809
Only an hour away, Owen.

1306
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:44,359
Eastern Division's
over the next hill.

1307
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,319
Hiya, big fella.

1308
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,320
Howdy, Orv.

1309
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:38,489
How are you feeling?

1310
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,259
Making too many
days in the saddle.

1311
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,259
I'll take it.

1312
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,399
Lee around?

1313
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,399
Yeah.

1314
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,919
Lee!
- Owen!

1315
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:45,919
How'd it go?

1316
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,919
How are you?

1317
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,209
Oh, smooth as silk.

1318
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,819
- What's your count?
- 2,000.

1319
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,819
Yours?

1320
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:52,819
Good.

1321
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:53,949
A little over 1,000.

1322
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:59,469
Well, that gives you Allard's
3,000 and some to spare.

1323
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:01,069
Who's Allard?

1324
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,190
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: Man you're
going to sell the herd to.

1325
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,799
That's right, so it is.

1326
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,429
It'd be news to Arch.

1327
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,789
Especially since he's planning
to get down to the panhandle

1328
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,779
and buy more stock.

1329
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,359
The deal's going through.

1330
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,829
How much does foreman make?

1331
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:19,539
And I'm a partner.

1332
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,579
I pay half your wages, remember.

1333
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,349
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: You
give me half my orders?

1334
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:25,689
Your orders are to keep
your nose out of my business.

1335
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,959
And let you steal
Arch's cattle?

1336
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,320
I'm a little hard
of hearing, Lee.

1337
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,349
Day after tomorrow,
we start for home.

1338
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:34,349
It's a big herd.

1339
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,790
A man in the way
could get run over.

1340
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:40,519
You better tell
it was a mistake.

1341
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,739
To forget about it.

1342
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,829
Your orders are still to keep
your nose out of my business.

1343
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,139
Wait a minute, Lee.

1344
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,139
I don't get it.

1345
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,169
You don't think you can pull
this off with me around,

1346
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,170
do you?

1347
01:12:05,536 --> 01:12:09,015
[mooing]

1348
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,480
Let's get on with the cutting.

1349
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,159
Owen.

1350
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,159
Figure this one out.

1351
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,249
I was working down by the river
past the last of the wagons.

1352
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,079
Don't make sense.
- What?

1353
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,579
Well, passing
one of the wagons,

1354
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,729
I saw those two Faskens.

1355
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:38,729
You're sure?

1356
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,259
No mistake.

1357
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,659
They've been on round-up.

1358
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,499
Stood there talking with
the rest of the crew.

1359
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,249
Needed a shave.

1360
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:45,730
They've slept in
wet clothes like us.

1361
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,239
Lee knew it and
didn't say anything.

1362
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,880
And he isn't worried
like he should be.

1363
01:12:58,570 --> 01:12:59,570
Owen.

1364
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:06,919
You know, I've been
thinking about that deal

1365
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,689
I made with Dave Allard.

1366
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,459
Yeah?

1367
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:12,259
I admit, I made a mistake.

1368
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:15,649
Like I always do when I haven't
got you around to steer me.

1369
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,539
Well, I'm glad you
see the light, Lee.

1370
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,539
Yeah.

1371
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,989
Well, I better get
down to the depot

1372
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,749
and stop Allard before he gets
too involved in that deal.

1373
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,249
Fine, you go ahead.

1374
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:28,399
Will you come with me?

1375
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,019
I'm pretty busy here.

1376
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:34,149
Well, it'll be much more
convincing with you around.

1377
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,750
All right, I'll
tell Mead we're going.

1378
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,409
Lee and I are going
over to the telegraph.

1379
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:46,459
We won't be long.

1380
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,904
All right.

1381
01:13:48,905 --> 01:13:52,370
[music playing]

1382
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,059
Remember now, we don't
blast till Daybright

1383
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,419
gets to that boulder.

1384
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,420
Yeah, I'll remember.

1385
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,159
Looks like this is our
last round-up together, Owen.

1386
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,439
Oh, I tried to pull a fast
one on you by grabbing that

1387
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,839
Allard deal, but I couldn't.

1388
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,159
So I'm going anyway.

1389
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,919
Just like I told you I would.

1390
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,919
Fine.

1391
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,499
I'm leaving you to win
right down the line, Owen.

1392
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,409
I'm leaving everything.

1393
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:37,409
Arch.

1394
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,409
The ranch.

1395
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:39,629
Jen.

1396
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:41,219
You.

1397
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,269
It's yours.

1398
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,131
The works.

1399
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:46,109
You sure you
thought this out good?

1400
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:47,749
You've been trying
to tell me for years

1401
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,339
how to do the right thing.

1402
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,709
You gave me the straight line
about getting away from here

1403
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,879
and beginning all over again.

1404
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,239
I just kind of hate
to do it, that's all.

1405
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,419
Maybe it's because, well, we've
had a lot of fun together.

1406
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,619
We have at that.

1407
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,619
Remember that time in
Kansas City when Arch took

1408
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,909
us to the cattlers' convention?

1409
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,049
Yeah.

1410
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:09,559
I played cards
with the big Texan.

1411
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,559
Yeah, man.

1412
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,339
You beat him in five
cold poker draws.

1413
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:13,339
Right.

1414
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:16,349
That's when I found out
what good a kicker was.

1415
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,749
Yeah, we sure had a
lot of good times, Lee.

1416
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,609
That's what I'll miss.

1417
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:23,389
I'll miss 'em, too.

1418
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,149
No matter how old you
get, there's that part

1419
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,979
of growing up you never forget.

1420
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,659
I'm glad you said that, Owenn.

1421
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,600
I'll remember that
when I'm gone from you.

1422
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,109
Now.

1423
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:42,110
[gunshot]

1424
01:15:52,086 --> 01:15:53,086

1425
01:16:13,046 --> 01:16:21,409
[distant gunshot]

1426
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,409
Where's Owen?

1427
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,619
Went with Lee over
to the telegraph.

1428
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:26,639
You hear that?

1429
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,779
Somebody's in trouble.

1430
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,890
Take some men and go see.

1431
01:16:32,348 --> 01:16:33,830
[gunfire]

1432
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,759
Go around the other side.

1433
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,019
Try to sneak up behind him.

1434
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,020
I'll cover you.

1435
01:16:57,153 --> 01:16:58,153
[gunshot]

1436
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:33,083
[gunshot]

1437
01:17:42,063 --> 01:17:43,063
[gunshot]

1438

[splashes]

1439
01:19:28,849 --> 01:19:29,849
OWEN DAYBRIGHT: Lee!

1440
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,449
I'm taking you in, Lee.

1441
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:44,509
We're going to settle up.

1442
01:19:44,510 --> 01:19:46,219
Not a chance.

1443
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,069
We're going to face Arch
and tell him the whole truth.

1444
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:51,449
For once.

1445
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:53,449
Come on out.

1446
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:55,429
You're forgetting.

1447
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:58,479
I still got my kicker.

1448
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,909
I always could
outdraw you, Owen.

1449
01:20:00,910 --> 01:20:04,429
I'll spot you that, but
it won't change anything.

1450
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,929
Come on out.

1451
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,370
Or do I have to
come in and get you?

1452
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,306
[gunshot]

1453
01:20:14,274 --> 01:20:15,750
[splashes]

1454
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,659
That's the whole story, Arch.

1455
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,729
All of it.

1456
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:33,089
It was in front of
me for years, Owen.

1457
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:34,089
I refused to see it.

1458
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:35,439
I lied to myself.

1459
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,484
You lied to make
it easier for me.

1460
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:42,399
You didn't kill him, I did.

1461
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,549
A long time ago.

1462
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,909
The day I looked away
and hoped he'd change.

1463
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:48,910
Hoped he'd work out.

1464
01:20:58,090 --> 01:20:59,859
I'll have to tell Jen.

1465
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,060
I'd like to tell her myself.

1466
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,910
[heroic music]
