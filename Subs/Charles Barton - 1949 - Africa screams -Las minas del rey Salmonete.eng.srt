4
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:25,689
Stay right were you are.

5
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,586
Don't move. Stay there now.

6
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:32,103
Steady.

7
00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:37,517
Now sit up. Sit up, sit up you.

8
00:01:37,517 --> 00:01:39,344
Up you fool up.

9
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,965
[Meow]

10
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:45,896
Sit up I said. Sit up.

11
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:53,655
[Hiss]

12
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:58,448
[Crash]

13
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:07,068
- Really Mr Livington.
- Oh I'm sorry. Please let me
help you.

14
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:10,482
Oh here.

15
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:13,517
[Hiss]

16
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:16,275
Buzz! Oh Buzz!

17
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,241
What's the matter?
- Buzz.

18
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,310
Take it easy what's the
matter?

19
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,931
- Look.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Take it away.

20
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,379
- Not here.
- Now wait a minute there. Take
it easy Stanley.

21
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,793
This is a
harmless little kitten.

22
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:32,172
Buzz I'm scared to death. Why
the look on his face.

23
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:36,896
I can't understand why you have
this terrible fear of animals
in you. What is it?

24
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:40,758
- When I was a little baby I was scared by my piggy bank.
- That's nonsense.

25
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:43,413
- You want to hear something worse?
- What?

26
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,310
I was 15 years old before I ate
my first animal cracker.

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,379
Come on, stores about to open
up.

28
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:58,448
Fix up your counters. Now get
to work. Come on, go on.

29
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:05,206
And how. Yes sir. That's the
truth.

30
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:08,793
- How do you do? May I help you?
- Do you happen to have a copy
of Dark Safari by Cuddleferd?

31
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:10,379
I'll find out.

32
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,827
Hey Bub.

33
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,413
How do you do gentleman.

34
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:22,172
We like to speak to salesman pal.
- Well I'm the salesman Stanley
Livington.

35
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:27,172
I'm the clerk in charge of all
jungle books. And at 11 o'clock
I'm giving a lecture.

36
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:31,862
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got a book by the name of ...
- Dark Safari by Cuddleferd.

37
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:36,413
Dark Safari by Cuddleferd. We
did have it but we got rid of
it sometime ago.

38
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:46,344
I want to tell you gentlemen I
read that book. I had
nightmares for 9 months.

39
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:47,793
How well do you remember that
book?

40
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:51,000
- Why?
- Do you remember a map then?
- A map in that book?

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,241
Of course
I remember it.

42
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:55,896
- Could you draw it?
- Could I draw it?
- For a $1000.

43
00:03:55,896 --> 00:04:00,758
Draw that map in that book for
$1000? Ha ha, for $1000 I could
draw that map in oil.

44
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:04,241
OK then meet us in the ally
tonight at 7:30.

45
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,758
And we'll take you to somebody
who will give $1000 the minute
you lay down the pencil.

46
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:13,862
- Is it a deal?
- Shake. Oh!

47
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:23,103
- OK pal see you in the ally tonight at 7:30.
- And be there chum, get me.

48
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:28,689
$1000 to draw that map. Ha ha.

49
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:33,931
- I'm sorry but that book is out of print. In fact we sold the last one some time ago.p- Oh dear I was afraid of that.

50
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:37,103
I've been to every bookstore in
the city. There is a map in

51
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,172
that book that I would give
$2500 for.

52
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,689
Will you give me that again
please?

53
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,172
I said there was a map in
that book that I would give
$2500 for.

54
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:52,689
$2500. Excuse me I'll be right
back.

55
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,241
What are you doing?

56
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,034
Hey Buzz this you'll never
believe there were two guys in
here....

57
00:04:57,034 --> 00:05:00,172
I understand. Look Stanley how
well do you remember that book
you read about Dark Safari?

58
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:01,482
That's what I'm trying to
tell you. There was two guys in
the...

59
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:04,275
Look you remember there was a
map in it.

60
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,103
You too. Now go away, go away.

61
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:09,275
- What are you doing there?
- I'm drawing that map now.
- Oh no you don't.

62
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,793
- What a minute.
- Oh you...

63
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:13,379
Buzz Don't tear that up. I
got a chance to...

64
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,689
Wait quite, quite. Come on
follow me now. Oh take it easy,
take it easy.

65
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:21,482
Madam you are the luckiest
person in New York this
morning.

66
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:27,068
- Allow me to introduce Stanley Livington. One of
the world's greatest wild
game hunters.

67
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:31,413
Well how exciting. Why game
hunters are my weakness. This
is really a thrill Mr Livington.

68
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,896
So nice meeting you to but I'm
really not...

69
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:37,655
It might interest you to know
that when Mr Cuddleferd wrote

70
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,379
Dark Safari Mr Livington was
right there.

71
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,689
- Oh.
- Wonderful.

72
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,827
Well then you must
be very familiar with the map
that is in that book?

73
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,103
- Map.
- Yes.
- Our sure.

74
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,172
That's one map that I can draw
in a darkroom even without a
pencil.

75
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,137
You see your troubles are all
over.

76
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:52,689
I could make arrangements to
bring him over to your home
this evening.

77
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:55,379
Oh Marvelous I think it's a
wonderful idea.

78
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,344
- My name is Emerson, Diana Emerson.
- How do you do Ms Emerson. But
no I have a date in the ally.

79
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:01,689
- She'll have to wait.
- She'll have to wait oh.

80
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,137
Here's my address. See you
tonight then.

81
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:07,896
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

82
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:14,896
That's the kind of girl I dream about. But you should see the ones I get.
[Whistles]

83
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:18,413
I tell you boss the guy said he
knew the map backwards. So we
make a date to meet him.

84
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,103
Bring
him in and have him draw it.

85
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:23,862
Yeah and the little muzzler
never shows up. After us
offering him a grand.

86
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:28,172
- Well you can relax I found somebody myself this morning.p- You did boss? Where?

87
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:31,758
- In Kloppers Department Store.
- That's where we found our guy.

88
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,551
Wait a minute. Was he a silly
looking little fat guy?

89
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,620
- That's him.
- Why that two timer.

90
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,379
You offer him $1000 and he holds out forpa higher price.

91
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,034
- The minute he puts his foot through the door I'll break every bone in his head.
- You'll do no such thing.

92
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:51,206
- When he leaves you boys can meet him outside and get my money back.
- We get you boss.

93
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:58,379
Now go out the side entrance.
I'm closing a deal with the man
who is going to lead the safari.

94
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:08,344
Won't you come in Mr Beatty.

95
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,206
This is the place. Now don't
forget she thinks you are a big
game hunter.

96
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,931
Buzz why do you keep getting me
in the middle? I wish you
hadn't.

97
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:18,137
Why you ingrate. Here I am
giving you a chance to make me
$2500.

98
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,965
Is that the way you want to
repay me for all the things I
could have done for you?

99
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:23,965
Come on.

100
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:37,413
- I'm sorry.
- Oh come on.

101
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,551
Stanley will you come on?
- I'm shutting off the water.

102
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:47,724
Well turn it off and come on.
- I stopped it.
- Good come on up here.

103
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:55,275
May I see you a minute please?

104
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:59,344
- Now what's the matter.
- My fingers stuck.
- Leave it there and come on.

105
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:03,758
- Ok.
- What's the matter. Let me see
this.

106
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:06,931
Not that one, not that. Not
that one! That one!

107
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:11,517
- Don't holler.
- Don't pull out that one.
- Wait a minute.

108
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:14,586
- Harry did you answer the door?
- No do I have to?

109
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:19,310
- Answer the door.
- Oh all right.

110
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:28,448
I do everything around here. I
have to be a cook and a butler.
One of these days I'll just..

111
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:33,068
Well.. That's all I'll just...
do it.

112
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:36,551
[Knock, knock]
Yes.

113
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:43,172
- Mr Johnson and Mr Livington to see Ms Emerson.p- Well come in.

114
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,103
[Knock, knock]

115
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:49,172
Well who is knocking? Well come
in!

116
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:52,793
Ms Emerson is busy for the
moment will you step in the
living room please.

117
00:08:52,793 --> 00:09:13,793
- Hats.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:22,344
Ow that hurts.

119
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,896
- That belongs on outside.
- Yeah I can't get it off.

120
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:28,655
- Help me get it off.
- Will you keep your hand...

121
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,068
- Not so hard your..
- Get your hand out of the way
now.

122
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,482
Get your hand out of the
way.

123
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:37,931
Well get your hand out of the
way I'll get it off.

124
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,517
Naturally I haven't publicized
the expedition cause I could

125
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:43,103
easily become the victim of
unscrupulous people.

126
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,586
If that map is one of the few
in existence.

127
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,000
The owner would
practically have you in the
palm of his hand.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,551
This man coming tonight is the
gullible type but fairly
intelligent.

129
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:54,931
If he could remember the map
accurately we will proceed at
once.

130
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,137
- That would be fine with me Ms Emerson.p- Now regarding your fee.

131
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:03,448
Suppose we say $5,000 in
advance and $15,000 on
completion.

132
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,620
- That's very liberal.
- On the contrary.

133
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,827
Money is no
object as long as I get what
I'm after.

134
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:16,620
- Come on will ya.
- Ha ha there it is.
- Oh not that hand this one.

135
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:25,068
Well put this hand in your
pocket. Ow get your hand out of
there.

136
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:30,379
Ow sometimes if.. Oh.

137
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,551
Stanley I just found out that
map is worth more than $2,500
to that woman.

138
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,344
- I can't get over it, all I did was go like this and the water came out.
- Are you listening?

139
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:43,034
Come on.
Come on!

140
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:45,896
You go in the living room and
wait. I'm going to snoop around

141
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:55,758
here and find out more about
this deal. Go ahead.

142
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:59,344
- Who was at the door Harry?
- Mr Livington and Mr Johnson.
- Good where are they?

143
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:07,413
- There in the living room.
- I'll see them in a minute and
have coffee in the library.

144
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:19,517
- Harry I'm phoning Gunner to come over. Please leave the door open.p- Yes Mam.

145
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,620
Excuse me. I didn't know anyone
was in the room.I'm awfully
sorry.

146
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,241
Say hold it right where you
are. You know you standing in

147
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:28,000
front of this here picture
reminds me of my last
expedition in Africa.

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,172
- Is that so?
- Yes indeed. Yes indeed.

149
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:34,275
And it was my most dangerous
expedition.

150
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:38,620
- We were after cats, big cats. You know what cats are?
- Lions I imagine.

151
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,965
Oh there is no imagining about
it my friend. Lions are lions,
here or anyplace they are lions.

152
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:47,310
You can't imagine the lions. Oh
no indeed. I want to tell you
something.

153
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,586
My first afternoon out I bagged
64 lions.

154
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,896
- Gad what a hunt.
- Really?
- Oh yes.

155
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:57,206
- Then I ran into an old friend of mine Clyde Beatty.
- No.

156
00:11:57,206 --> 00:12:04,724
- And was he irked. He didn't bag a lion for 2 weeks ha ha.
- Really?

157
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,827
I bagged them all he couldn't
get one of them.

158
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,482
Of course when it comes to
hankering lions he don't know
from nothing.

159
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:13,310
I am the boy
right over here.

160
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:18,655
I want to tell you something
else too between you and I.
Clyde Beatty is a phony.

161
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:23,034
On the side a pretty nice
fella. But between you and I a
phony.

162
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:27,517
Something else I want to tell
you friend.

163
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:31,931
Who do you think
tames the lions that he has
inside the cages?

164
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:37,827
- Me Stanley Livington the world's greatest hunter.
- No kidding.

165
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:43,965
- Yes sir, well one of the greatest. By the way what's your name?
- Clyde Beatty.

166
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:46,689
Clyde Beatty. Clyde it's nice
knowing you. I want you to
stick around,

167
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:49,344
cause I want to tell you how I
used to go in myself and tame
those lions.

168
00:12:49,344 --> 00:13:07,413
Now when it comes to taming the
animals Clyde. Clyde! Clyde!

169
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:11,931
Aw good evening I see you've
met Mr Livington our big wild
game hunter eh?

170
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:13,620
- Yes indeed.
- Swell.

171
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,379
He's juts been telling me
about some of his exploits.

172
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:18,344
Oh swell, swell that's fine.
Tell him about the time you and

173
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,310
Clyde Beatty went tiger hunting
in India.

174
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:29,275
- Yes I'd like to here about it.
- Stanley tells me that he out
shot Beatty 5 to 1.

175
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:33,379
- By the way I don't you introduced me to this gentleman.
- Clyde Beatty.

176
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,758
Clyde Be... Clyde Beatty. I'll
be seeing you around.

177
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:42,862
Mr Beatty I'm sorry for what I
said about Mr Beatty. Excuse me.

178
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:45,068
Why Mr Johnson and Mr
Livington please forgive me for
keeping you waiting.

179
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,413
You met Mr Beatty?

180
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:54,620
- It seems Mr Livington and I are old hunting pals.
- Won't you gentlemen have tea.

181
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,551
And after coffee we'll have Mr
Livington draw the map.

182
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,724
I'm terribly sorry but Mr
Livington will not be able to
draw the map.

183
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:03,551
But he's got to. The whole
success of my trip depends on
it.

184
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,586
You mean you intend to take a
trip to Africa?

185
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:09,551
- Very definitely I'm planning a safari.p- I wonder if I may be excused.

186
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:12,551
I know you folks would rather
talk business in private.

187
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:17,379
If you don't mind I think it
would be better. Mr Beatty's
hat Harry. Excuse me gentlemen.

188
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:26,103
Goodnight old friend.

189
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,379
Quick Grappler and Boots are
outside waiting to slug Johnson
Livington.

190
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,586
Tell them the plans
have changed and to lay off.

191
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:33,034
Yes Mam.

192
00:14:33,034 --> 00:14:35,620
Look Buzz let me draw the map
we'll get $2,500 and get out of
here.

193
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,034
Certainly not. Now if I play
your cards right we'll get more
than $2,500.

194
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:44,448
- Listen you heard her she is organizing a safari.
- I wish I was there.
- Where?

195
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:50,068
On the Hoboken safari right now.
- Uh..Uh.. Stanley you are
absolutely right.

196
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:55,000
- As you surmised, to be frank with you, I don't blame you for having the desire.
- The desire to what?

197
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,344
- Of course I'll have to explain everything to the lady.p- Explain it to me.

198
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:02,689
Uh Mr Livington insists on
joining your safari to Africa.

199
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:05,965
- I insist.
- There you are, you heard it
from his own lips.

200
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,965
Just a hold... How do you do?

201
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:11,965
You see with Mr Livington in
Africa he'd feel right at home

202
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:14,724
and it would be very simple for
him to draw the map without any
difficulties.

203
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,862
- I think it's an excellent idea.
- Surely.

204
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:20,862
Once we are there he can lead
us to the east fork of the
Talabongo and Okavangy river.

205
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:24,241
- Lead you to the fork?
- Yes surely of course it will
be the regular $5,000 fee in

206
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:27,793
advance and $15,000 on
completion.

207
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:32,000
- Of course that includes my services.P- Why splendid.p- That's fine.

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,655
- And for your safety I am going to assign you my best follow upper.p- Follow upper?

209
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:39,655
Yes he is the man who follows
you in the jungle. And if you

210
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,620
miss a shot at a charging
animal he shoots and saves your
life.

211
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:49,448
[Crash]
- Oh that's him now. Excuse me.
- Surely.

212
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,620
- Hey listen Buzz. I'm not going over there. You got no right to out me in a thing like that.
- All this kind of money?

213
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,586
- You're always putting me right in the middle..p- Don't tell me...

214
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,758
I don't care what kind of
money it is.

215
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:58,000
- Don't you give me that..
- Now Listen..
- Aw no arguments...

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,931
- I'm not going to go over there with all those lions roar!
- You'll do as I tell you.

217
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:03,724
- Roar. I'm going to...
- You'll do as I tell you no
arguments.

218
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:08,413
Oh no I'm not. I wont.

219
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:13,551
- Gunner I'd like to have you meet Mr Johnson and Mr Livington. Gunner Jenson.p- Hi.

220
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,172
I don't want to seem
inquisitive but just what are
going to Africa for?

221
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,517
Why we are going after an
Orangutan Gargantua.

222
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:22,793
- An Orangutan Gargantua.
- Excuse me please.
- Pardon me.

223
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:27,586
- May I see you.
What's Orangutan Gargantua?
- It's a big ape.

224
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,310
- Big ape.
- Yeah stop worrying.
- Big ape. Excuse me, excuse me.

225
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,413
- Pardon me.
- Big ape?
- Yeah.

226
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:37,413
- You mean like the thing that I see in the circus like the father to the monkey.
- Yeah it's only bigger, bigger.

227
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:42,172
- Ping. And he's going to protect me?
- Um huh.
- Um huh.

228
00:16:42,172 --> 00:16:56,034
Gunner show them how you can
shoot the winchester.

229
00:16:56,034 --> 00:17:05,896
You missed the lion. I raise
the gun to my shoulder and look
threw the peep sight and I....

230
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,551

grab for the pump slide and
I..I...

232
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:17,793
Huh no pump slide.

233
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:26,448
Stanley come here. Stanley. Now

should come up, what would you
do?

243
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,275
- I'd throw out an anchor.
- If a west wind came up what
would you do?

244
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:54,482
I'd throw out another anchor.

245

- And a south wind came up what would you do then?p- I'd throw out another anchor.

Well we've looked the whole
place over. You want to know
something boss?

266
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:50,620
This don't look
like a place to find diamonds.

You fool. Don't you ever
mention the word diamonds.

268

We're supposed to be after an
Orangutan.

getting awfully sick of these
two guys you're depending on.

They're always fouling us up.

out from under there. Hurry up,

274
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:24,827
- Oh Buzz just when I had the tent up.P- Never mind the tent. Comepover here and draw that map.

275
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:26,655
- The map.
- The map.

276
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:28,758
If I draw it will you let me
go home?

277
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:30,620
- Why do you want to go home?
- I forgot something.
- What did you forget?

278
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,517

- Draw the map come on.

as a tycoon. Ho ho ho.

00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:39,827
Buildings, yachts, railroads. I
don't know I might even buy an
airline according to how I feel.

281
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:45,724
Winters in Maine, summers in
Florida. Oh it's unbelievable.

282
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:50,724
- Get him he could even get his laundry up.
- Have you got it ready yet?
Come on!

00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:54,896
You got? That a boy. Oh this
paper here is worth a million
dollars.

284
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:57,689
A million dollars? Well I mean
I did it give me something. I
got to have something for it.

285
00:22:57,689 --> 00:23:01,379
- Oh sure, sure. I intended to. Here, here's a nickel.p- Thank you.

- Hello Diana.
- Harry some tea for Mr Johnson.
- And plenty of sugar.

288
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,551
- Wonderful day we're having. You are looking marvelous yourself.
- Your in fine spirits.

289
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:16,344
I have all the reasons in the
world to be. I finally

290
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:19,206
persuaded Stanley to draw the
map.

291
00:23:19,206 --> 00:23:23,827
- Oh well may I see it?
- Eh I also made some very
interesting discoveries.

292
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:27,655
Aside from the Orangutan there
are far more important things

293
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:29,586
to be found in that particular
territory.

294
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:32,172
- Really.
- Yes and due to the facts I

295
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:34,620
personally think I'm entitled
to new deal.

296
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,862
- What kind of a deal did you have in mind?
- Well I'd say 20% of the
safaris profits would be fair.

297
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:48,551
- Very liberal. In view of your generosity may I see the map?
- Oh yes surely, surely.

298
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:56,586
Now this map will take you
right to eh...

299
00:23:56,586 --> 00:24:01,379
Um.
There seems to be something
lacking here.

300
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:07,241
I'll see Stanley. There's some detail work....
He hasn't really completed the
map.

301
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:09,068
- I'll be right back.
- Here's your tea and I put
plenty of sugar in it.

302
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:12,068
Oh drink it yourself.

303
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:20,551
- Oh drink it yourself, drink it yourself.P- Harry I want to see Boots andpGrappler immediately.

304
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:24,310
- Come here. Wise alec huh.
- Now what's the matter with
you.

305
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,275
Thought you were putting
something over on me.

306
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:28,206
This is not the map that was in
Cuddleferd's book.

307
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,724
- Oh yes it is.
- This, this thing tells you

308
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:31,551
how to get to Kloppers
Department Store.

309
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:34,137
Well that's the map. I used to
keep that map in Cuddleferd's
book.

310
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:38,310
Listen you nit-witted numb
skull. These people want a map
of Bangy Territory.

311
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,931
- Bangy Territory. Bangy Territory!
- Yes.

312
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:44,172
I was wondering why they want
to pay all that kind of money

313
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:46,379
just to find the directions on
how I get to Kloppers
Department Store.

314
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,620
That I couldn't understand.

315
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,586
Just a minute. Do you realize
that we are in the most

316
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:52,620
dangerous spot we've ever been
in our lives?

317
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,827
- Dangerous spot.
- Dangerous spot!
- Buzz.

318
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,310
- What.
- Is is worse than the time
when Skinny Marink knocked the

319
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,931
chip off my shoulder?

320
00:24:57,931 --> 00:25:00,206
- Ah certainly.
- Worse than that?
- I should say it is.

321
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:03,068
- And the time I drew the line like that?
- Far more.

322
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,172
Yeah but that time he came over
the line. It's worser than that?

323
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:07,103
Never mind that, it's worse
than that.

324
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:11,034
- Oh are we in trouble.
- Wait a minute we got to do
something.

325
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,206
- I have it. We've got to get out.
- Sure.

326
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:15,310

00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,827

329
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:23,448
We were juts going to take

330
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:27,758

Um. I'm getting sick and tired
of being pushed around by you

335
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:54,310

00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:20,620
Step on that side of the line.

340
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,137
- Stanley, Stanley, no.
- Don't bother me.

341
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:25,448
Stanley your not going to
kill anyone.

342
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:27,793
- Don't hold me back.
- Don't so that.

343
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:36,103
Somebodies got to get it. And
when I get this mad somebodies
got to get it.

344
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:41,655
Fine friend you are. You bring
me way out here in the heart of
the jungle why?

345
00:26:41,655 --> 00:26:43,344
Because you
told me you could draw the map.

346
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:45,965
You can't draw it can you? You
knew you couldn't.

347
00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:48,724
Why did you bring me way out
here? Now what am I going to do?

348
00:26:48,724 --> 00:26:51,103
What am I going to do with the
boats I was going to buy?

349
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:53,448
The buildings I was going to
buy, the railroads I was going
to buy.

350
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:59,310
Put that down. That's a fine
how do you do. Nice goings on
from a pal, from a friend.

351
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,241
And I never... I never expected
it from you. I'll have to go
into bankruptcy that's all.

352
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:07,896
That's all that's left for me
to do Then what will my friends
say?

353
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:10,241
To think that you my bosom
friend...

354
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:17,482
- Hey look where are you going with the water?p- Oh my tents on fire.

355
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:22,620
Well what do you have to say
for yourself?

356
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,068
â™ª

357
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:32,620
[Jungle noises]

358
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,655
[Yelling] Hold it, hold it.
Stop. Go no further.

359
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:39,689
- What are you stopping here for, its early yet?P- Well this is where Cuddleferdpstopped.

360
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:43,379
Now uh, on the bottom of page
389, according to Cuddleferd.

361
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,724
He wrote that he had a very
uneventful day.

362
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:48,172
Therefore he
made camp on a bank of the
Crocodile River.

363
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:51,862
Now over there is a crocodile river.
Eh Uh.

364
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:54,724
- Over here.
- [Scoffs] Uh, you'll have to
forgive him.

365
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:58,517
- You see, Stanley is actually living the book.
- That's not all.

366
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:02,551
At night Cuddleferd, he posted
a double guard because he was
nearing the Bangy Country.

367
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:05,275
Which was full of ferocious
animals and cannibals.

368
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,965
Stanley is right, this is
pretty dangerous territory.

369
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:12,103
- I suggest we pitch camp on this side tonight.
- That means we will lose an
entire half day.

370
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:14,827
- Well if you cross over your gonna lose 2 days anyway.
- Why?

371
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,827
Well according to Cuddlefer,
when he crossed the river he

372
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:18,586
was brought down by Jungle
Fever.

373
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:22,000
And he was that way for 36
hours.

374
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Ms Emerson, I think we should
look for a location to pitch
camp.

375
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,931
- All right Mr Beatty.
- Stanley come here.

376
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:33,896
You got use a little more tack
when you talk to Ms Emerson.

377
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,931
You know shes libel to send us
back to the States.

378
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:39,862
- Good, good.
- Good, good. You...whats the
matter?

379
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:46,241
Ah, my goodness are you
worrying about that? That's
just a little baby lion.

380
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,655
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'll get a hold of him.

381
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:56,034
- [Laughs] Can you imagine that.
- Buzz don't. Buzz, don't.

382
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,620
Here, look here.

383
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,586
- Remember what happened in Kloppers Department Store, don't do it.
- Now don't get excited.

384
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:02,724
- This little cat was raised on milk.
- So was I, but I eat meat now.

385
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:05,034
Take it away, let it go back to
it's mother.

386
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,793
- Touch it, touch it. Now go ahead touch it. Their you are.

387
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:12,793

- Look at that, hey.

388
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,448

- What do you mean you got your

389
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:17,206
finger... you touched him
didn't you.

390
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:21,586
- I...I...I touched a real lion.
- That's all their is to it.
- A... a real lion I... Brave!

391
00:29:21,586 --> 00:29:23,103
- Well that's it.
- Just like that.

392
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:25,448
That will take that fear out
of you.

393
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:29,586
[Laughs] I'm gonna catch that
little baby lion and I am gonna
bring it back to Diana.

394
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:32,862
Hey wait a minute. That's a
good idea.

395
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:36,965

459
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:37,448
The least you could have done
was put a red

460
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:38,724
lantern in. I'm gonna report
you to the African League For

461
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,206
Better Road Improvement. I
certainly am.

462
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,482
- Now take it easy, take it easy.

anyway a trap?

463
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,724
Yes a trap.

464
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:46,620
- Your doing it all wrong.
- What do you mean I'm doing it
all wrong?

465
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,724
This guy don't know for
nothing about a trap.

466
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,689
- I showed Frank Buck how to build all his traps, everyone of them.
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,655
He listens to me, I'm one of
the biggest game hunters in the

468
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,827
whole world. That's why I'm

469
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:57,034
Will you wait a minute.

- You've got the whole thing... it's longer... will you keep quite!
- Will you listen.

471
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:01,034
It's longer over here... will

475
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,103
Yeah, well get on with the
truck and stand over there.

476
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:14,827
Boys hit the trap again, now
get it all ready.

477
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:16,827
Mr Buck the boys have finished
resetting the traps.

478
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,620
Alright go down the other way
and set the other ones.

479
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,689
- I'm sorry I feel in your trap.
- Oh that's alright.

480
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,724
But last night, I saw something
like I have never saw before in
my life.

481
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,758
Not even in a nightmare, I've
never saw anything like this.

482
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:31,103
- I'm gonna tell ya. He had a head like that.

Hes...

[Staggered breathing]

488
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:06,103
A little sugar.

489

[Exhales sharply]
What makes you so nervous?

496

502
00:37:19,827 --> 00:37:22,551

And you won't miss it, and
look out for my traps.

505
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,241
Now wait I think you better
take a gun along with you.

506
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:29,655
By george I think we can use
one.

507
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:32,724
- Yeah.
- Thanks a lot, so long Mr Buck.

â™ª

510
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:49,068
- What a business for a guy to be in.

lot a dough back in the States.

511
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:52,620

516
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:17,448
- That's right.
- Stanley, I think Diana is

517
00:38:17,448 --> 00:38:20,172
trying to put something over on
us.

518
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:24,517
Doesn't it seam funny to you,
that as soon as Clyde Beatty
goes out to bag lions.

519
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:27,000
She's lets us come down here to
take a swim in the river.

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,517
- Oh tush, tush.
- Never mind the tush, tush.
- I can use it, I can use it.

521
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:34,448
Just a minute. We may be in the
diamond territory.

522
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:38,758
- Maybe she knows where the diamonds are.
- Buzz.
- Maybe she has the diamonds.

523
00:38:38,758 --> 00:38:42,034
- Buzz you got to take it easy. You need more sleep at night kid.

Lets go in and take a bath. A
bath or something, and we will
swim nicely.

527
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:54,517
Alright put it down, put it
down.

528
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:57,103

529
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,137
- Wait, wait a minute. Where are you going.
- I'm gonna dive in.
- In there!

530
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,896
Of course in there, I'm not
gonna dive in there. You'll
hurt your head over there.

531
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:04,379
- Did you read this sign?
- What?

532
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:06,965
Do you know what that sign
says?

533
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:09,172
- Who's walking on the grass?
- Wait a minute you can't dive
in there,

534
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:11,275
theirs nothing but
crocodiles in there.

535
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:16,034
- Ahhh. What!
- Crocodiles. Don't get
excited, don't get excited.

536
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:19,172
- You see over here, theirs nothing but nets.
- I dive inside the nets.

537
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,241
- The crocodiles can get in the nets.
- That's good.

538

00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:38,551
I don't understand why he has
to try those cats out before he
sends them back to the States.

573
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:40,793
It worries me.

574
00:41:40,793 --> 00:41:42,862
It doesn't worry me half as
much as those two knot heads
you brought along with us.

575
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:47,068
Relax.

The gossip that's going
around this camp.

580
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:07,620
"Stanley's a coward, Stanley's
a coward." Afraid of a little
tiney winey alligator like that.

581
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,000
- It was a big alligator...
- Oh stop it. Are you afraid of
that?

582
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,655
I think so.

583

- Oh stop it. It's only a skin.
Feel it, feel it. Don't be
afraid of it.

584
00:42:14,344 --> 00:42:16,827
- That enough.
- Now look I'm gonna make a

585
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:19,517
hero out of you. Whether you

588
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:25,344
Un huh.

589
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,206

Oh you me to get Diana and

- Your gonna have the lion skin
and then... Ha ha.

592
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:35,103

00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:39,344
- I'm going over and have a chit chat with Diana.
- That a boy...

595
00:42:39,344 --> 00:42:41,241
I'm gonna show her I'm a pretty brave
kid.

596
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:43,206
- And I don't like this kind of talk going around.p- Now your talking.

597
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:44,034
Down by the path by the
water bags.

598
00:42:44,034 --> 00:42:49,517
I'll be there.

599
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:51,724
[Lion roars]

600
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:54,068
Well boys, in a little while we
can say good by to Mr Beatty

601
00:42:54,068 --> 00:43:00,379
and his lions and crocodiles
and cages.

602
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:03,482
Tag this one for shipping back
to the States, he's a good one.

603
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:15,379
And get the other 3 ready for
the training cage. I'll be back
later then to work them out.

604
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:17,862
[Humming]

605
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,275
- Diana?

606
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,551
I would like chit chat with

608
00:43:23,586 --> 00:43:28,275
- Now, uh, a few things I want to get straightened out. I uh...
- Yes?

609
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:33,586
I'm gonna tell you over here.

610
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:36,482
Diana their is some talk going
around this camp, and I don't
like it.

611
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:41,862
I don't like it no how. I am getting plenty peeved about it, and I have a right to.
Have a drink.

612
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:45,724
People are going around saying
I'm afraid of lions. Well
that's not true that's a lie.

613
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:48,310
I'm one of finest big game
hunters in the world!
