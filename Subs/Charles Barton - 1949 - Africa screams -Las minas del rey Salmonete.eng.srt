50
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:37,103
I've been to every bookstore in
the city. There is a map in

51
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,172

$2500 for.

I understand. Look Stanley how
well do you remember that book
you read about Dark Safari?

got a chance to...

Wait quite, quite. Come on
follow me now. Oh take it easy,
take it easy.

Madam you are the luckiest
person in New York this
morning.

66
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:27,068
- Allow me to introduce Stanley Livington. One of
the world's greatest wild
game hunters.

67
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:31,413
Well how exciting. Why game
hunters are my weakness. This
is really a thrill Mr Livington.

68
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,896
So nice meeting you to but I'm
really not...

69
00:05:33,896 --> 00:05:37,655
It might interest you to know
that when Mr Cuddleferd wrote

70
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,379
Dark Safari Mr Livington was
right there.

71
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,689
- Oh.
- Wonderful.

72
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,827
Well then you must
be very familiar with the map
that is in that book?

73
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,103
- Map.
- Yes.
- Our sure.

74
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,172
That's one map that I can draw
in a darkroom even without a
pencil.

75
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,137
You see your troubles are all
over.

76
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:52,689
I could make arrangements to
bring him over to your home
this evening.

77
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:55,379
Oh Marvelous I think it's a
wonderful idea.

78
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,344
- My name is Emerson, Diana Emerson.
- How do you do Ms Emerson. But
no I have a date in the ally.

79
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:01,689
- She'll have to wait.
- She'll have to wait oh.

80
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,137
Here's my address. See you
tonight then.

81
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:07,896
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

82
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:14,896

[Whistles]

83
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:18,413
I tell you boss the guy said he
knew the map backwards. So we
make a date to meet him.

84
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,103
Bring
him in and have him draw it.

85
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:23,862
Yeah and the little muzzler
never shows up. After us
offering him a grand.

86
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:28,172
- Well you can relax I found somebody myself this morning.p- You did boss? Where?

87
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:31,758
- In Kloppers Department Store.
- That's where we found our guy.

88
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,551
Wait a minute. Was he a silly
looking little fat guy?

89
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,620
- That's him.
- Why that two timer.

90
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,379
You offer him $1000 and he holds out forpa higher price.

91
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,034
- The minute he puts his foot through the door I'll break every bone in his head.
- You'll do no such thing.

92
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:51,206
- When he leaves you boys can meet him outside and get my money back.
- We get you boss.

93
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:58,379
Now go out the side entrance.
I'm closing a deal with the man
who is going to lead the safari.

94
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:08,344
Won't you come in Mr Beatty.

95
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,206
This is the place. Now don't
forget she thinks you are a big
game hunter.

96
00:07:11,206 --> 00:07:13,931
Buzz why do you keep getting me
in the middle? I wish you
hadn't.

97
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:18,137
Why you ingrate. Here I am
giving you a chance to make me
$2500.

98
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,965
Is that the way you want to
repay me for all the things I
could have done for you?

99
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:23,965
Come on.

100
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:37,413
- I'm sorry.
- Oh come on.

101
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,551
Stanley will you come on?
- I'm shutting off the water.

102
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:47,724
Well turn it off and come on.
- I stopped it.
- Good come on up here.

103
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:55,275
May I see you a minute please?

104
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:59,344
- Now what's the matter.
- My fingers stuck.
- Leave it there and come on.

105
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:03,758
- Ok.
- What's the matter. Let me see
this.

106
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:06,931
Not that one, not that. Not
that one! That one!

107
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:11,517
- Don't holler.
- Don't pull out that one.
- Wait a minute.

108
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:14,586
- Harry did you answer the door?
- No do I have to?

109
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:19,310
- Answer the door.
- Oh all right.

110
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:28,448
I do everything around here. I
have to be a cook and a butler.
One of these days I'll just..

111
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:33,068
Well.. That's all I'll just...
do it.

112
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:36,551
[Knock, knock]
Yes.

113
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:43,172
- Mr Johnson and Mr Livington to see Ms Emerson.p- Well come in.

114
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,103
[Knock, knock]

115
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:49,172
Well who is knocking? Well come
in!

116
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:52,793
Ms Emerson is busy for the
moment will you step in the
living room please.

117
00:08:52,793 --> 00:09:13,793
- Hats.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:22,344
Ow that hurts.

119
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,896
- That belongs on outside.
- Yeah I can't get it off.

120
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:28,655
- Help me get it off.
- Will you keep your hand...

121
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,068
- Not so hard your..
- Get your hand out of the way
now.

122
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:33,482
Get your hand out of the
way.

123
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:37,931
Well get your hand out of the
way I'll get it off.

124
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,517
Naturally I haven't publicized
the expedition cause I could

125
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:43,103
easily become the victim of
unscrupulous people.

126
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,586
If that map is one of the few
in existence.

127
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,000
The owner would
practically have you in the
palm of his hand.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,551
This man coming tonight is the
gullible type but fairly
intelligent.

129
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:54,931
If he could remember the map
accurately we will proceed at
once.

130
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,137
- That would be fine with me Ms Emerson.p- Now regarding your fee.

131
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:03,448
Suppose we say $5,000 in
advance and $15,000 on
completion.

132
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,620
- That's very liberal.
- On the contrary.

133
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,827
Money is no
object as long as I get what
I'm after.

134
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:16,620
- Come on will ya.
- Ha ha there it is.
- Oh not that hand this one.

135
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:25,068
Well put this hand in your
pocket. Ow get your hand out of
there.

136
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:30,379
Ow sometimes if.. Oh.

137
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,551
Stanley I just found out that
map is worth more than $2,500
to that woman.

138
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,344
- I can't get over it, all I did was go like this and the water came out.
- Are you listening?

139
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:43,034
Come on.
Come on!

140
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:45,896
You go in the living room and
wait. I'm going to snoop around

141
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:55,758
here and find out more about
this deal. Go ahead.

142
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:59,344
- Who was at the door Harry?
- Mr Livington and Mr Johnson.
- Good where are they?

143
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:07,413
- There in the living room.
- I'll see them in a minute and
have coffee in the library.

144
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:19,517
- Harry I'm phoning Gunner to come over. Please leave the door open.p- Yes Mam.

145
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,620
Excuse me. I didn't know anyone
was in the room.I'm awfully
sorry.

146
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,241
Say hold it right where you
are. You know you standing in

147
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:28,000
front of this here picture
reminds me of my last
expedition in Africa.

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,172
- Is that so?
- Yes indeed. Yes indeed.

149
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:34,275
And it was my most dangerous
expedition.

150
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:38,620
- We were after cats, big cats. You know what cats are?
- Lions I imagine.

151
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,965
Oh there is no imagining about
it my friend. Lions are lions,
here or anyplace they are lions.

152
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:47,310
You can't imagine the lions. Oh
no indeed. I want to tell you
something.

153
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,586
My first afternoon out I bagged
64 lions.

154
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,896
- Gad what a hunt.
- Really?
- Oh yes.

155
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:57,206
