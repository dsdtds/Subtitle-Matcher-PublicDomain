1
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,147
What is it?

2
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,189
Sorry to have to report...

3
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:47,233
there are four stowaways
in the forward hatch.

4
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:49,652
Stowaways? How do you know
there are four of them?

5
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:51,237
They were
singing Sweet Adeline.

6
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,780
Get them out of there,
you hear?

7
00:01:52,865 --> 00:01:53,948
But we can't find them.

8
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,826
And besides,
they've been
writing insulting notes.

9
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:02,165
So, I'm an old goat, am I?
Listen to me.

10
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,667
Find them if you have
to clear out that whole hatch!

11
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:05,835
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:09,172
Captain, when do we get in?

13
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,548
Wednesday!

14
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,758
I beg your pardon. Wednesday.

15
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:13,009
Thank you.

16
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,470
In all my dreams

17
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:17,972
In all my dreams

18
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,975
Your fair face beams

19
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:23,519
Your fair face beams

20
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,063
You're the idol

21
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:30,151
of my heart

22
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:34,947
Sweet Adeline

23
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:39,994
My Adeline

24
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,627
This is the only
way to travel, boys.
The only way.

25
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:49,629
I was gonna bring
the wife and kiddies...

26
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:51,756
but the grocer
couldn't spare another barrel.

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,382
I was gonna
bring my grandfather,

28
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,092
but there's no
room for his beard.

29
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:57,887
Why not send
for the old swine,
let his beard come later?

30
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,639
I sent for his beard.
You did?

31
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:01,307
It's coming by "hair" mail.

32
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,017
Fellas,
I think I hear someone.

33
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,728
If it's the captain,
I'm gonna have
a few words with him.

34
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:07,688
My hot water's been
cold for three days

35
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:09,649
and I haven't got
room to swing a cat.

36
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,442
In fact,
I haven't even got a cat.

37
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,569
My grandfather
can swing a cat.
He can?

38
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:15,613
That'd make
a good job for him.

39
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:16,781
Come on, men.

40
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,366
Someone's coming.

41
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:25,206
Come on, men. Snap it up.

42
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,208
Listen, fellas.

43
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,043
We've got to find
those stowaways.

44
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,920
And when we do,
we'll put them in irons.

45
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:32,129
Aye, aye, sir.

46
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:34,382
Take a look in
behind those cases.

47
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,218
You fellows,
look behind those boxes.

48
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,558
Never mind the barrels.

49
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:45,309
Aye, aye, sir.

50
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,394
What's that?

51
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:47,478
I just said "aye, aye, sir."

52
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:48,980
Never mind that.
Find those men.

53
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:50,523
Aye, aye, sir.

54
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:16,591
They're not here, sir.

55
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,175
Oh, yes, they are.

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,136
Hoist all this
stuff up on deck.

57
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,721
And get these
barrels out of the way.

58
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,389
Very well, sir.

59
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,601
Lower away up there.

60
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,396
Hurry up with that sling.

61
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:34,525
You'll never find
them standing around.
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,777
You look in back
of those bales.
You look in those boxes.

63
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:37,945
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:40,281
All right, boys.

65
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,535
Make it snappy up there!

66
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,467
Hey!

67
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:00,927
There they are!

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Hurry.

69
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:22,883
You fellas, go aft.
You fellas, take a look
in behind those lifeboats.

70
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:50,911
Captain,
tell us about the stowaways.

71
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:53,748
I'll have them in
the brig before long.

72
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,918
That's terribly romantic.
I'd love to meet a stowaway.

73
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,253
Hey, you.

74
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:01,505
Are these your gloves?
I found them in your trunk.

75
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,175
Go to your rooms.
I'll be down shortly.
Who are you?

76
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,094
Are you the floorwalker?
I want to
register a complaint.

77
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,679
What's the matter?
Matter enough.

78
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:10,973
You know who
sneaked into my stateroom
at 3:00 a. M.?

79
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,184
Who did that?
Nobody,
and that's my complaint.

80
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,895
I'm young.
I want gaiety,
laughter, ha-cha-cha.

81
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,063
I wanna dance.

82
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:19,231
I wanna dance
till the cows come home

83
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:20,608
Just what
do you mean by this?

84
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,735
I don't like the way
you're running this boat.

85
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,112
Get in the backseat
and let your wife drive.

86
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:28,365
I've been captain
of this ship for 22 years.

87
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,575
Twenty-two years?

88
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,036
If you were a man,
you'd go in
business for yourself.

89
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,538
I know a fellow,
started last
year with a canoe.

90
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:37,833
He has more women than
you can shake a stick at,
if you enjoy that.

91
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,002
One more word,
and I'll throw you in irons.

92
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:42,338
You can't do it with irons.
It's a mashie shot.

93
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:45,925
It's a mashie shot if
the wind is against you.
If the wind isn't, I am.

94
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,094
How about those
barrels down below?

95
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:49,512
I wouldn't
put a pig in there.

96
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,013
See here, you—

97
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:52,848
Not even if you got
down on your knees.

98
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,810
And here's your gloves.
You would take them,
wouldn't you?

99
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,478
And keep away from my office.

100
00:07:57,562 --> 00:07:59,438
Now, see here, you!

101
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,911
How dare you invade
the sanctity of
the captain's quarters?

102
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,830
I thought you
was the captain.
I'm hungry.

103
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:17,289
I'm gonna find
something to eat.

104
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,583
I'll take care of that.
Hello.

105
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:20,668
Send up the captain's lunch.

106
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:21,836
Two.

107
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,797
Send up his dinner, too.
Who am I?

108
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:29,051
I'm the captain.
You want to choose up sides?

109
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,640
Engineer, will you tell them
to stop the boat from rocking?

110
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,308
I'm gonna have lunch.

111
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,521
What's the matter with you?

112
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:42,189
What's the matter with me?
I'm hungry.

113
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:43,274
I didn't eat in three days.

114
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:44,316
Three days?

115
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,860
We've only been on
the boat two days.

116
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,361
I didn't eat yesterday...

117
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:51,031
I didn't eat today,
and I won't eat tomorrow.
That makes three days.

118
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:54,160
State your business.
I've got to
shiver my timbers.

119
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,454
I got no business.
I come up to see
the captain's bridge.

120
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,082
Captain's bridge? I'm sorry.
He always keeps
it in a glass...

121
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,167
while he's eating.

122
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:03,419
Would you like to
see where he sleeps?

123
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,462
I saw that. That's the bunk.

124
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:08,132
You're wasting your breath,
and that's no great loss.

125
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,300
A fine sailor you are.

126
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,970
You bet I'm a fine sailor.
You know,
my whole family was sailors?

127
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:16,473
My father was
partners with Columbus.
What do you think of that?

128
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,976
Your father and
Columbus were partners?
You bet.

129
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,603
Columbus has
been dead 400 years.

130
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,313
They told me
it was my father.

131
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:24,523
Hop up there,
and I'll show you

132
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,775
a few things you
don't know about history.

133
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:29,111
Now look. There's Columbus.

134
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,071
That's Columbus Circle.

135
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,659
Would you mind
getting up off that flypaper
and giving the flies a chance?

136
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:38,621
You're crazy.
Flies can't read papers.

137
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:42,833
Now, Columbus sailed
from Spain to India
looking for a shortcut.

138
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:45,085
You mean strawberry shortcut.

139
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:46,712
I don't know.

140
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:49,548
When I woke up,
there was the nurse
taking care of me.

141
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,176
What's the matter?
Couldn't the nurse
take care of herself?

142
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,304
You bet she could,
but I found it out too late.
Enough of this.

143
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:56,722
Let's get back to Columbus.

144
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:58,098
I'd rather get
back to the nurse.

145
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,391
So would I.

146
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:01,810
But Columbus was
sailing along on his vessel.

147
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:02,978
On his what?

148
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:04,438
Not on his what.
On his vessel.

149
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:07,107
Don't you know
what "vessel" is?
Sure. I can vessel.

150
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:14,698
Do you suppose
I could buy back
my introduction to you?

151
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,409
Now,
one night Columbus' sailors
started a mutiny.

152
00:10:17,494 --> 00:10:20,412
No mutinies at night.
They're in the afternoon.

153
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:22,998
You know, mutinies Wednesdays
and Saturdays.

154
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,626
There's my argument.
Restrict immigration.

155
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:57,574
All right.

156
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,204
Of all the colossal impudence!

157
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,124
Why don't you stand up?
Can't you see he has no chair?

158
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,167
Why, you—
You better keep quiet.

159
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,753
We're a couple of
big stockholders
in this company.

160
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,088
Stockholders?

161
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,757
You look like
a couple of stowaways to me.

162
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,968
Don't forget
that the stockholder

163
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,013
of yesteryear is
the stowaway of today.

164
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,848
Well,
you look exactly like them.

165
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:22,516
What do they look like?

166
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,477
One of them goes around
with a black moustache.

167
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:29,189
So do I. If I had my choice,
I'd go around
with a little blonde.

168
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:32,776
I said one goes around
with a black moustache.

169
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,779
You couldn't
expect a moustache
to go around by itself.

170
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:38,449
Don't you think a moustache
ever gets lonely, Captain?

171
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,783
Sure, it gets lonely.

172
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,535
When my grandfather's beard
gets here,

173
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:43,078
I'd like it to
meet your moustache.

174
00:11:43,163 --> 00:11:45,789
I'll think it over.
I'll talk it over
with my moustache.

175
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,833
Has your grandfather's beard
got any money?

176
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:50,044
Money? Why,
it fell hair to a fortune.

177
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:51,545
Now, listen!

178
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:54,256
Stockholders or
no stockholders,
you clear out of here!

179
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:56,925
There's someone
in that room.

180
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,721
There's
somebody in that closet,
and I think it's you, Captain.

181
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,475
Now, we can eat in peace.

182
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,018
All right.
Here's a piece for you.

183
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,186
That a baby.

184
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,357
Beg pardon, Captain.

185
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:12,983
How dare you enter
the captain's quarters...

186
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,068
while I'm eating.

187
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,235
Sorry, sir.

188
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:22,951
Now I've got you!

189
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,415
Don't forget the butter.

190
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,547
You know, there's some
mighty pretty
country around here.

191
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,631
I've—

192
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,799
I beg your pardon.

193
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,223
Pardon me.
Is this yours?

194
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:27,766
Why, no.

195
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:32,396
You sure?

196
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm positive.

197
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:45,325
Is this yours?

198
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:46,785
Yes, it is.

199
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,622
As I was saying, there's some
mighty beautiful
country around here.

200
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:51,957
The trees are lovely.

201
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,333
You bet they are.
I love them.

202
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,857
Get out of my way!

203
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,843
Gibson. Come out of there.

204
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:28,804
Yes, sir.

205
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,433
I want to report I found a—

206
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,185
Gibson,
you've been drinking again...

207
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,728
and you know
what my orders were.

208
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,565
But those stowaways,
I just caught one
of them in there.

209
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,816
Stowaway, huh?

210
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,150
Yes. There he is.

211
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,945
Help!
Look out!
You're choking me!

212
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,448
I thought so.
Go to your quarters.

213
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,453
That's one now.

214
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,791
That's a dummy. Come with me.

215
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,714
First officer.

216
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,966
I'm telling you, that's him.

217
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,969
This has gone far enough.
Get up to your quarters.

218
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,307
Yes, sir.

219
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:16,476
Quiet.

220
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:22,232
I think you're right.

221
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:24,359
I know you're right.

222
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,110
Would you like
anything before lunch?

223
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:08,528
Yes, breakfast.

224
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:12,824
Nobody eats in here.

225
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:14,076
I do.

226
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,956
Mustard's no good
without roast beef.

227
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,958
Do you want your
nails trimmed long?

228
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,878
About an hour and a half.
I got nothing to do.

229
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,714
You're
a nice-looking gal, all right.

230
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,132
You got it.

231
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:30,342
Thank you.

232
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:31,968
And you can keep it.

233
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,402
That's a nice gal?

234
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:51,321
Somebody's coming.

235
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:52,698
Come on, boys.

236
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,664
You're next, Cap.

237
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,916
I'm looking for
a couple of mugs.

238
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:06,503
No, you boys look on B Deck.
Aye, aye, sir.

239
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,296
How about a shave?

240
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,132
Sure. Give me a once-over.

241
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,591
Once-over, partner.

242
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:14,052
No, a shave.

243
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,303
On the face.
All right.

244
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,180
Wake me up when
you get through.

245
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,141
We'll take care
of you, all right.

246
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:26,606
We take the tonsils last.
I think we work on
the moustache first.

247
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,484
Give him a little snoop.

248
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:37,701
This side's too long.
Give him a little
snoop this side.

249
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,789
Now this side
is too short.

250
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:47,586
It's too short.
The other side is
too long. Snoop him up.

251
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:51,715
That's better, but the side
that was too short
now is too long...

252
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,759
and the side that was
too long is too short.

253
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,386
I think you got to
give him one more snoop.

254
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,307
I think we better measure.

255
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,689
It's about a foot too much.

256
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:11,443
No, the measure's
a foot too much.

257
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,864
Now it looks much better.

258
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,909
It can stand one more
snoop in
the middle, I think.

259
00:19:18,993 --> 00:19:20,744
In the middle, one snoop.

260
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,708
That's fine.
That's very good.

261
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:31,046
I think it's a little
bit rough right here.
I fix that.

262
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,509
You know, I'm never going
on this boat again.
The food is no good.

263
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:37,594
Of course,
I no eat yet, but even

264
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,763
if I don't eat,
I like the food good.

265
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,098
One more snoop.

266
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:53,235
That's beautiful?
That's what you
call a work of art.

267
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,072
Hey, you know,
I think you give him
one snoop too much.

268
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:57,739
Hey, you know,
I think you give him
one snoop too much.

269
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,496
And I want you to know,
I'm fed up on your alibis.

270
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,039
Take it easy.

271
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,625
You're getting all excited.

272
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,919
Now where do you
think you're going?

273
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,964
Never mind.
I'm running this racket.

274
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:17,592
Just stay here and
keep out of sight
like I told you.

275
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:22,889
No you don't.
Now, listen to me,
Mr. Alky Briggs.

276
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:25,141
You can't keep me
cooped up like this.

277
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:27,978
I've played second fiddle
on this ship long enough.

278
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:32,190
Now you listen.
I'm not after any dames.

279
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,526
I'm after Joe Helton,
I tell you, and

280
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,695
he can't get away
from me on this boat.

281
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:41,241
He's got to put
his okay on my gang,
or he's gonna get this.

282
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:01,011
Hey, who are you?

283
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,429
I'm the tailor.

284
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:06,266
That reminds me.
Where are my pants?

285
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,851
You've got them on.

286
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,106
Pardon me while I
step into the closet.

287
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,569
And get a load of this,
if you come in
again at 3:00 a. M.--

288
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:20,196
Stop bothering me.
Tell it to the tailor.

289
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:21,990
Alky!

290
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:23,617
Alky!

291
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,587
What are you
doing in there?

292
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,505
Nothing. Come on in.

293
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,801
You can't
stay in that closet.

294
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:42,886
can't, can I?

295
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,305
That's what they said
to Thomas Edison,
mighty inventor...

296
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,057
Thomas Lindbergh,
mighty flier,

297
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,808
and Thomas Shefsky,
mighty like a rose.

298
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,728
Just remember
that if there weren't

299
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,438
any closets, there
wouldn't be any hooks...

300
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,440
and if there weren't
any hooks,
there'd be no fish,

301
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,651
and that would suit me fine.

302
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,490
Don't try to hide.
I know you're
in that closet.

303
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,075
Did you see me
go in the closet?

304
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:06,493
No.

305
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,036
Am I in the closet now?

306
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,496
No.

307
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:13,792
Then how do you know
I was in the closet?
Your Honor, I rest my case.

308
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,963
Come here, brown eyes.

309
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:20,507
You're not gonna
get me off this bed.

310
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,509
I didn't know
you were a lawyer.

311
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:24,260
You're awfully
shy for a lawyer.

312
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:26,680
You bet I'm shy.
I'm a shyster lawyer.

313
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:29,391
Then what do you
think of an egg
that would give me—

314
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,476
You've been getting nothing
but dirty breaks.

315
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,311
We can clean and
tighten your brakes...

316
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:36,147
but you'll have to stay
in the garage all night.

317
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:39,651
I want excitement.
I want to ha-cha-cha-cha.

318
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,450
You don't realize it.

319
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,954
From the time he got
the marriage license,
I've led a dog's life.

320
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,956
Are you sure he
didn't get a dog's license?

321
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,749
Alky can't make a fool of me.

322
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,127
I want to go places.
I want to do things.

323
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,921
I want freedom, I want
liberty, I want justice!

324
00:23:01,257 --> 00:23:03,967
Madam, you're making history.
In fact, you're making me.

325
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,094
And I wish you'd keep
my hands to yourself.

326
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,597
You know what I want.
I want life, I want laughter,
I want gaiety.

327
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,391
I want to ha-cha-cha-cha.

328
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:18,690
Madam, before I
get through with you,

329
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,650
you will have
a clear case for divorce...

330
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:21,818
and so will my wife.

331
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,612
The first thing to do is
to arrange for a settlement.

332
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:27,032
You take the children,
your husband takes the house.

333
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:30,535
Junior burns the house,
you take
the insurance and I take you.

334
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,120
But I haven't
any children.

335
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,749
That's the trouble
with this country.
You haven't any children.

336
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,545
And as for me,
I'm going back in the closet
where men are empty overcoats.

337
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,297
Brown eyes.

338
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,354
Sir, this is an outrage,
breaking into a man's home.

339
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,608
There'll be
a letter about this in
the Times tomorrow morning.

340
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,818
Yeah?

341
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:50,156
But you won't read it,
'cause I'm gonna
lay you out pretty.

342
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,200
You're gonna
lay me out pretty?

343
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,869
That's the thanks I get
for freeing
an innocent girl...

344
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:56,955
who, although she is hiding
at the moment...

345
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,415
has promised to become
the mother of her children.

346
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,002
And with that, sir,
I bid you a fond farewell.
Good day, sir.

347
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:05,672
Good day.

348
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:11,052
Come out of there.
I want to talk to you.

349
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:13,763
I'm sorry, but we're using
the old-fashioned iceman...

350
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:17,183
and we find him
very satisfactory
for keeping the house warm.

351
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,941
Just as I thought,
you're yellow,
grabbing at a woman's skirts.

352
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,777
I'm wise.
You're wise?

353
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:29,237
What's
the capital of Nebraska?

354
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:31,948
What's the capital
of the Chase National Bank?
Give up?

355
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,575
Now,
I'll try you on an easy one.

356
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,285
How many
Frenchmen can't be wrong?

357
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,494
I know—

358
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,745
You were warm
and so was she.

359
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:40,498
Don't be discouraged.
With a little study
you'll go a long way.

360
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,041
And I'd wish you'd start now.

361
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,668
Do you see this gat?

362
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,962
Cute, isn't it?
Santa Claus bring it

363
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,797
for Christmas?
I got a fire engine.

364
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:50,508
Listen, mug.
Do you know who I am?

365
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:54,387
Don't tell me.
Are you animal or vegetable?
Animal.

366
00:25:55,181 --> 00:25:57,432
Get this. I'm Alky Briggs.

367
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,851
And I'm the fellow
who talks so much.

368
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,729
Fancy meeting you here
after all these drinks.

369
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:09,152
Wait a minute.
Sorry, I can't stay.

370
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,820
The captain's
waiting to chase me.

371
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:14,282
You can stay, all right,
until I finish with you.

372
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,117
Alky, darling, please!

373
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:19,537
Don't "darling" me.
Get in that next
room and stay there!

374
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,582
Get in that next room.

375
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:27,587
I'm not good
enough for her, am I?

376
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,759
Is there anything
you've got to say
before I drill you?

377
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:35,136
Yes, I'd like to
ask you one question.

378
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:36,346
Go ahead.

379
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:40,016
Do you think that
girls think less of a boy
if he lets himself be kissed?

380
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,186
Don't you think that although
girls go out
with boys like me...

381
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,355
they always
marry the other kind?

382
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:47,690
If you're gonna
kill me, hurry up.

383
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,484
I have to take
my tonic at 2:00.

384
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:52,528
I can use a guy
with your nerve.

385
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,990
I think we could get
along well together.

386
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,035
Of course,
the first year we might have
our little squabbles.

387
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,829
But, then, that's inevitable,
don't you think?

388
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,336
And what do you want here?

389
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:11,923
I was just looking for him.

390
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,883
Do you know this guy?

391
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,387
I've known him for years.
He used to live in
the next barrel to me.

392
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,765
I see. The stowaways.

393
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:23,851
I can help you bozos.

394
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:25,061
Mr. Bozos to you.

395
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:28,231
All right, Mr. Bozo.
And you can help me.

396
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:32,652
I'm shorthanded,
and I want to get
a guy on this boat.

397
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,028
It's too late to
get him on now.

398
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,905
Should've said so
before we sailed.

399
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,825
Listen.
This is a map of B Deck.

400
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,119
There's Joe
Helton's stateroom.

401
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,332
And he's a tough egg.
And you're coming with me...

402
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,335
while I have it out with Joe.

403
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:51,963
Do you know who Joe Helton is?

404
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,549
I think I'll get off this boat
until this blows over.

405
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,719
If you know
what's good for you,
you'll stick with me.

406
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,808
You keep the windows covered
while I go in. Now, move!

407
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,882
What is the idea of this?

408
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,301
It's all right.
I make a move for you.

409
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,803
This is an outrage!

410
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,304
I'll call the captain!

411
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:06,431
The captain don't play chess.

412
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:07,557
Purser!

413
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,225
Steward! Come here.

414
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,893
Too much noise here for us.

415
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,521
We better go
someplace where it's quiet.

416
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,650
Come in.

417
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,866
Your cigars, sir.
Thanks.

418
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,412
Wait a minute.

419
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,501
Thank you, sir.

420
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,571
Dad, now look at you.
You aren't even dressed yet.

421
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,116
You can do all the dressing
for the family, Mary.

422
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:10,870
Old Joe Helton is
taking things easy
for the rest of his life.

423
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,706
We're big shots now, baby.

424
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:20,505
Come in.

425
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,635
Hello, Joe.

426
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,720
Hello, Briggs.
What do you want?

427
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:30,556
I just wanted to
have a friendly talk.

428
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,684
I'm sort of
worried about business.

429
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,144
Step in the
other room, baby.

430
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,188
But, Dad—
Run along, honey.

431
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,526
Your kid?

432
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,239
She's cute, isn't she?

433
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:50,409
I don't think
we've got anything
to talk about. Get out.

434
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,496
Not before I get
your okay on my gang.

435
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,248
I'm not doing you
any favors.

436
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:57,041
Yes, you are.

437
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,378
You're gonna sign this.

438
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:14,141
I'm taking over
your territory,
or there's gonna be trouble.

439
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:16,269
I'm taking no sides.

440
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:19,397
You'll have to fight it out
with Butch and the gang.

441
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,233
I'm stepping into
your shoes as boss.

442
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,361
I'm not backing up any
small-time chiseller.

443
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,738
Don't put on
the Ritz with me.

444
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,740
Don't get
cocky with me, Briggs.

445
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,075
I'm talking turkey.

446
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:34,412
You can't make all the dough
and then run out on your pals.

447
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,248
I'm not taking orders
from a mug like you!

448
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,042
Scram!

449
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,378
So that's your answer?
Here's mine!

450
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:54,807
So you got your gang with you?
I'll get you later.

451
00:32:58,312 --> 00:32:59,770
Who are you guys?

452
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,232
What are you doing
in my room?

453
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:06,485
That's my partner,
but he no speak.
He's dumb and deaf.

454
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,618
You guys don't know it,
but you just scared

455
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,745
a pretty tough egg
out of this room.

456
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,580
Sure,
we're a couple of tough guys.

457
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:18,748
Do you want to
make some money?

458
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:19,999
Money?

459
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:25,171
Money? Feel this muscle.
Feel his muscle.

460
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,925
All right.
How much you pay?

461
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,219
Just how tough are you?

462
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,263
You pay little bit,
we're little bit tough.

463
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:35,890
You pay very much,
very much tough.

464
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,725
You pay too much,
we're too much tough.

465
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,435
How much you pay?
I pay plenty.

466
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,647
Then we're plenty tough.
And we show you, too.

467
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,608
Partner,
show him how tough we are.

468
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,364
See?
That's nothing. That's free.

469
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,699
Now we give you
the real stuff this time.

470
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,118
Come on.
Put some pep in it.

471
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,871
The one-two uppercut.
You know, on the button.

472
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:03,376
No downstairs button.
Upstairs button.

473
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:14,053
That's fine.
That's good, all right.

474
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,473
I tell him you're tough,
and you punch
like a lily. What's a matter?

475
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:20,726
You wanna lose this job?
Give him the stuff this time.

476
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:23,437
Excuse me, boss.
He can do much better...

477
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:24,605
but he no work good today.

478
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,982
He no get paid.
When he get paid,
you watch him.

479
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:29,985
Come on. This time
we give him the works.
Come on. Hurry up.

480
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,155
On the button this time.
Come on, I tell you.
On the button.

481
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,574
Hurry up.
Give me the punch.
Come on.

482
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:36,742
All right.

483
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,744
Come on! Punch!

484
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:53,259
That's enough. Wait.

485
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,177
What do you think of us?

486
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:56,429
You're great.

487
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,098
Not so loud.
You want him to
get a swell head?

488
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,934
You guys are
plenty tough, all right.

489
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,104
I'm spying on you.

490
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:09,275
You're just the fellows
I need. You're hired.

491
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,696
We're great, huh?
You're great.

492
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,239
My partner?
He's great.

493
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,533
My grandfather's great.
He's a great-grandfather.

494
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,496
When Helton comes out
of his room, plug him.

495
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,039
What'll we plug him with?

496
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,624
Didn't I give you two gats?

497
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,961
We had to drown the gat,
but we saved you
a little black gitten.

498
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,589
Here, take these,
and hang onto them now.

499
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,217
Don't leave me for a minute.

500
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,554
And keep your eye on that guy
that just went out of here.

501
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:39,680
You understand.

502
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:42,808
Anybody come near the boss,
let him have it.

503
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,977
You're all right
now, boss.

504
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:48,230
Anybody comes near you... .
What's a matter with you?
Look out.

505
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:50,691
That's all right.
He was just practicing.

506
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:51,817
Get out.

507
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,778
Now I can take
a walk out on deck

508
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,738
and feel safe.
Come on. Let's go.

509
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,916
There he comes now. Get him.

510
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,586
Don't worry. We'll get him.
I've got my
finger on the trigger.

511
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,433
Hey, don't forget.

512
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,269
Anybody comes near the boss,
let him have it.

513
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,182
It's the boss.
He's got a disguise.

514
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,726
Take off the whiskers.
We know you.

515
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,271
What do you mean?

516
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,898
Officer!

517
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:23,576
Why didn't you get him?
Not afraid, are you?

518
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,744
Afraid? Me?
A man who's
licked his weight...

519
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,664
in wild caterpillars? Afraid?
You bet I'm afraid.

520
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,166
So—

521
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:32,877
Hello.
How are things in the closet?

522
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,004
You know,
I still smell of mothballs.

523
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:37,256
I don't want to talk to you.

524
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,980
So here you are,
loafing around
with these tramps.

525
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,690
I came down to see Joe Helton.

526
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,483
Don't you think
we'd better go?
What?

527
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,527
And leave this woman alone
with her husband?

528
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,154
Suppose her
sweetheart came in.

529
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:03,616
Alky Briggs,
don't think you can keep me
cooped up in that stateroom.

530
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,825
Because you're crazy!

531
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,620
You'll stay down there
and keep out of my business.

532
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:08,704
Do you understand?

533
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,706
Keep out of my business.
Your turn.

534
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,209
You were going to
show me a good time.
A good time!

535
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,837
I might as well
have stayed home
and played solitaire!

536
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:17,963
Your turn.

537
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:21,133
Pipe down.
I've more important things
than you to worry about.

538
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,217
Your turn.

539
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,720
You say that
again and I'll scratch
your eyes out!

540
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:27,681
You take this gun.
You're gonna need
it more than I will.

541
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,099
Oh, you!

542
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,579
Just the man I wanna see.
If I show you
how to save 20%...

543
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,748
would you be interested?
Of course you would.

544
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,584
First,
your overhead is too high
and your brow is too low.

545
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,504
Interested already,
aren't you?
Wait till I get through.

546
00:38:58,588 --> 00:38:59,964
I haven't got time.

547
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,423
Two fellows are
trying to attack you...

548
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:04,718
and two fellows are
trying to defend you.
Now, that's 50% waste.

549
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,929
Why can't you be attacked
by your bodyguards?

550
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:10,599
Your life will be saved,
and that's 100% waste.
Now what have you got?

551
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:12,267
Me, and I'll
attack you for nothing.

552
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,435
What are you getting at?

553
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:14,603
I anticipated that.

554
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,773
How does an army travel?
On its stomach.
And you? On a ship.

555
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,608
Of course,
you're saving your stomach.

556
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:20,859
The same common sense—

557
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,111
I don't think you realize—

558
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:24,822
I realize it's
a penny here and there,
but look at me.

559
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,573
I've worked
myself up from nothing

560
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,450
to extreme poverty.
What do you say?

561
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:29,743
I'll tell you what I say—

562
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,120
Then it's all settled.

563
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:33,747
I'm to be your new bodyguard.
In case I attack you...

564
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:35,374
I'll be there to
defend you, too.

565
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,669
When you want to be attacked,
I'll defend you
10 minutes later.

566
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:42,423
I've already got
two bodyguards,
but I'll think it over.

567
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,774
Thank you.
You're welcome.

568
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,776
What's the matter with you?

569
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,403
I've got a frog in my throat.

570
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,738
What?

571
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:07,114
A frog in my throat.

572
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,699
You've got
a frog in your throat.

573
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:10,200
Yes.

574
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:15,414
You can't do that
to my customers!
Cut it out!

575
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,251
Say,
what's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?

576
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:48,322
Have your landing cards
and passports ready, please.

577
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,368
How do you do,
Madame Swempski?

578
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:54,912
Hello, boys.

579
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,246
Any statement for the press?

580
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:57,581
No, I'm afraid not.

581
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:59,374
Nothing of
interest on this tour.

582
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,377
Is it true
the opera is on the decline
in Central Europe?

583
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,587
Absurd.

584
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:07,257
I predict they're going to
have the greatest year
they've ever had.

585
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,009
Is it true that
you're gonna get

586
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:10,761
married again
while on this tour?

587
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:15,349
Gentlemen,
I don't know what to say.
Gentlemen, I'd say just this.

588
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,309
The bicycle will
never replace the horse.

589
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:19,728
But,
the horse will never replace
the bicycle...

590
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:23,482
which is quite a horse on
the bicycle if I ever saw one,
and I never did.

591
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,943
I dare you to print that,
you muckrakers.

592
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,111
Have a cigar, babe.

593
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,278
Okay for the picture, Joe.

594
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:31,573
Pictures?
Here's a little sex stuff
for your front page.

595
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:34,785
Now, hold it steady, please.

596
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:44,545
You can say it was
a real love match.
We married for money.

597
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:48,382
Eh, my shrinking violet?
It won't hurt you to
shrink 30 or 40 pounds.

598
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,758
You impudent cad!

599
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,260
I'll report you to your paper.

600
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,761
Let me do the reporting.

601
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,555
Is it true you'll
get a divorce as soon

602
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,431
as your husband
recovers his sight?

603
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:58,642
Is it true you wash
your hair in clam broth?

604
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,310
Is it true you
danced in a flea circus?

605
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:01,979
This is outrageous!

606
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,856
If you don't stop,
I'll call the captain.

607
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
So that's it.

608
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:07,276
Infatuated with
a pretty uniform.
We don't count.

609
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,279
We gave you our best years,
now you want an officer.

610
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,114
I don't like this innuendo.

611
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:13,991
That's what I always say,
love flies out the door

612
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,909
when
money comes innuendo.

613
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,995
Good-bye.
It's nice to have seen you,

614
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:20,122
but I've got nobody
to blame but myself.

615
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:21,331
Could you tell me—

616
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:22,541
Please... .

617
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:25,043
You're awfully glum.

618
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:30,007
I was just thinking,
after the boat lands,
I may never see you again.

619
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,136
Does it matter to you
whether you ever see me again?

620
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:38,307
I can't think of
anything in the world
that matters more.

621
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,475
Mary, I'll never leave you.

622
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:48,984
Tag.

623
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,486
Tag.

624
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,077
Wait a minute!

625
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:01,663
I'm just trying to
sneak off the boat,
that's all.

626
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,415
I'm looking for
the man who owns... .

627
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:05,417
Where's your passport?

628
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:10,714
Wait a minute.
Let me handle this.

629
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:14,384
I don't like to
speak about it,
Officer, but I happen to be...

630
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,887
a good friend of
the meat supplier
to this boat.

631
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,013
Well?

632
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:19,056
Well, do you like lamb chops?

633
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,515
Yes, what of it?

634
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,017
This man doesn't
handle lamb chops.

635
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:23,936
But the roast beef
is very good today.

636
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,064
You fellows can't
get off the boat
without showing passports.

637
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:31,151
Get on back there at
the end of the line and
get your passports open.

638
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,986
Go on.
Get back there.

639
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,824
Stuffed shirt.
When he said that to me...

640
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:40,452
you could've knocked me over
with a feather.

641
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,955
He gives you service.

642
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,709
It looks like
we're up against it.

643
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:49,836
It's up to you to
get us a passport.

644
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:54,841
I got you, didn't I?

645
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:58,553
Well, you'll have to get up
pretty early in the morning
to steal from me.

646
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:02,724
He did get up early this
morning, but you weren't
here. Perhaps tomorrow?

647
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:05,936
Well, come on.
Let's try another one.

648
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,607
What's the idea,
putting your
hand in my pocket?

649
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,067
Just a little mistake.

650
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,986
I had a suit that
looked just like that

651
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,904
and I thought
those were my pants.

652
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,781
How could they be yours,
when I've got them on?

653
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:19,825
This suit had
two pairs of pants.

654
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:22,035
Better keep your
hands to yourself.

655
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,912
Do you know
who's on this boat?

656
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,831
Maurice Chevalier,
the movie actor.

657
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:26,957
I just ran into him.

658
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:28,125
Did you hurt him?

659
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:29,668
How do you know
it was Chevalier?

660
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:31,503
I got his
passport right there.

661
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,880
Now he can't get off the boat.

662
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,843
Hey, he looks like Chevalier.
And I can look like Chevalier.

663
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:39,261
I certainly look
like Chevalier.

664
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,931
But that's not enough.
You have to sing his song
to get off this boat.

665
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:46,226
If a nightingale
could sing like you

666
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,438
They'd sing much
better than you do

667
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,940
Dandy. Sing like that,
they'll throw us
all off the boat.

668
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:54,651
Well, let's try it.
All right. Come on.

669
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,611
Have your passports ready.
Straight out...

670
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,947
you'll find
the baggage on the deck.

671
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:02,075
Have your passports ready.

672
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,995
Keep in line, everybody. 945.

673
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:09,124
Keep in line, everybody.
Have your passports ready.

674
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:11,960
1092.

675
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,842
Never mind.
Hey, if you want to
get off the boat...

676
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:20,052
get in the back.

677
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,179
Oh, I didn't get on
in the back.
I got on in the front.

678
00:45:22,263 --> 00:45:23,263
Never mind that.

679
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:24,806
Leave them alone.

680
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:27,351
You're right...
I told them to stay in line.

681
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:28,769
Yeah? Show me your passport.

682
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:30,896
Yeah, right here.
That's my name.

683
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:33,440
Maurice Chevalier?

684
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:34,608
Yeah.

685
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:36,234
This picture
doesn't look like you.

686
00:45:36,402 --> 00:45:37,986
Sure, I'm Maurice Chevalier.

687
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:39,154
I'll sing for you.

688
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:42,407
If a nightingale
could sing like you

689
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:45,994
They'd sing much
better than they do

690
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,038
Here, never mind that.

691
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:50,290
Get back in line
where you belong.

692
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:56,213
I was ahead of you!

693
00:45:57,715 --> 00:45:58,965
Your passport.

694
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:03,470
Let me have your passport.
This picture
doesn't look like you.

695
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:05,222
It don't look like
me from the front,

696
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,349
but go in the back of
the boat, just like me.

697
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:09,935
You're not
Maurice Chevalier.

698
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:11,686
No.
Are you Maurice Chevalier?

699
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:14,231
Well, there you are.
Wait. I prove it.

700
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:17,734
If a nightingale
could sing like you

701
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:20,946
He sing much
better than you do and

702
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,072
Out!

703
00:46:22,281 --> 00:46:23,281
No push me!

704
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:24,366
Get out of here!

705
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,077
Get back in line
where you belong.
Passport!

706
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:31,415
This picture
doesn't look like you.

707
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:33,417
It doesn't look
like you either.

708
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:35,043
This man has no moustache.

709
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,711
The barbershop wasn't open.

710
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:38,338
Why, look at that face.

711
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,965
Well, look at that face.

712
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:42,634
Hey, are you going to identify
yourself, or else—

713
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:46,179
If a nightingale
could sing like you

714
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:48,932
They'd sing much
sweeter than they do

715
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:52,936
For you brought
a new kind of love to me

716
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:56,440
Out! Back in line
where you belong!

717
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,612
Get off there!

718
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,698
Get off the table!

719
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,867
What do
you think this is here?

720
00:47:06,951 --> 00:47:08,660
Put that down!

721
00:47:08,828 --> 00:47:10,579
Lunatic!

722
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,291
Stop that!

723
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,500
You want to break that?

724
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,919
Here, let it alone!

725
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:23,758
Passport. I said passport,
not pasteboard.

726
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:29,973
Come on with that passport!
Not washboard!

727
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:31,892
Passport!

728
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:36,438
Chevalier?

729
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,652
If a nightingale
could sing like you

730
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:46,239
They'd sing much
sweeter than they do

731
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:51,203
For you brought
a new kind of love to me

732
00:47:52,955 --> 00:47:57,083
And if the sandman brought me
dreams of you

733
00:47:57,376 --> 00:48:01,880
I'd want to dream
my whole life through

734
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:06,551
For you brought
a new kind of love to me

735
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:17,729
Get him out of here!

736
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:19,731
Put him back there
where he belongs!

737
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:21,316
Take it easy, folks.

738
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,279
The gangplank is
to the left, please.
Don't crowd. Don't crowd.

739
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:28,823
Take your time. Ladies first.

740
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,992
Let me off the boat.
I'm a sick man.

741
00:48:31,077 --> 00:48:32,118
I feel faint.

742
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:33,161
I don't care, take your time.

743
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:36,206
I tell you, I feel faint.
I'm going to faint.

744
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:38,333
Someone get a doctor!

745
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:39,834
Somebody fainted.

746
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:43,088
Where's a doctor?
A doctor! I want a doctor!

747
00:48:43,172 --> 00:48:45,298
She's sick.
We'll take care of you.

748
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:47,592
Look, she's got a chill,
cover her up.

749
00:48:48,886 --> 00:48:51,179
No, get off. Take her pulse.

750
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:55,976
No purse, put it back. Pulse.
I think you best
take her temperature.

751
00:48:56,352 --> 00:48:58,937
That's good,
we'll take care of you, lady.

752
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,272
All right.

753
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:04,818
You fools,
I'm not the patient.

754
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:07,737
We're not the doctor.
Come on.

755
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:10,407
Doctor! Is there
a doctor on the boat?

756
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,741
Doctor!

757
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,119
Are you a doctor?

758
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:15,662
Sure, I'm a doctor.
Where's the horse?

759
00:49:15,746 --> 00:49:17,163
A man fainted over here.

760
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,707
Man fainted?
I'll soon fix him.

761
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:21,334
Just my hard luck it
couldn't be a woman.

762
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,258
Here's the doctor.

763
00:49:29,635 --> 00:49:31,886
Just as I thought,
smoking too much.

764
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:33,847
Here he is here, Doctor.

765
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:36,099
Don't tell me.
I'll find him myself.

766
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:45,609
I can't do
anything for that man.
He's fainted.

767
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,111
What he needs is
an ocean voyage.

768
00:49:48,195 --> 00:49:51,573
In the meantime,
get him off the boat
and have his baggage examined.

769
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:52,699
Gangway!

770
00:49:52,783 --> 00:49:54,409
You all get close
so he won't recover.

771
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:57,954
Right this way, please.
Step right around here.

772
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,128
Step lively down there.

773
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:22,312
Back that ambulance in here!

774
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:28,943
Hey!

775
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:37,285
Helton's throwing
his party tonight,

776
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:39,621
and this time we
blow the works.

777
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:42,582
Now, you guys are
going in as musicians.

778
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:45,585
And stay that way until
I give you the office.

779
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,712
Say,
what about those four guys
in the house?

780
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:49,381
The ones you said
were on the boat.

781
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:52,550
Don't worry about them.
They eat out of my hand.

782
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:57,013
The thing for you to
worry about is that girl.
Keep your eye on her. Get me?

783
00:50:57,098 --> 00:50:59,015
That ought be easy to take.

784
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,141
Okay.

785
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:02,435
Sit tight and
I'll give you a call.

786
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:43,518
Have you guys
got an invitation?

787
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,603
We give you
invitation of Chevalier.

788
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:49,607
When the nightingale
sings like you

789
00:51:49,692 --> 00:51:54,070
Cut it out! And stay away
from this door, see?

790
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:10,003
Mary?

791
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:19,596
You certainly had me worried.
I thought you'd
forgotten your own party.

792
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,639
You haven't been
doing all the worrying.

793
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:23,725
I was afraid
you wouldn't come.

794
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:37,655
My, but, there are
a lot of
strange-looking people here.

795
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:57,133
Ladies and gentlemen!
Quiet, everybody.

796
00:52:57,718 --> 00:53:01,513
A lady's diamond
earring has been lost.
It looks exactly like this.

797
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:03,264
In fact, this is it.

798
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:06,434
I beg your pardon!

799
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,812
How about you
and I passing out
on the veranda?

800
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:10,396
Or would you
rather pass out here?

801
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,482
Sir, you have
the advantage of me.

802
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:15,568
Not yet, but wait
till I get you outside.

803
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:17,904
You're pretty fresh,
aren't you?

804
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:20,782
That's my wife and
I don't like the way
you're acting here.

805
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:23,827
If you don't like our country,
go back where you came from.

806
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:25,870
I should sink that
right in your scalp.

807
00:53:25,955 --> 00:53:28,248
Run for your life!
The Indians are coming!
What?

808
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:31,084
Put your scalp in
your pocket. Here.
The Indians.

809
00:53:32,586 --> 00:53:34,504
Come here.
I'll get him.

810
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:41,135
Have a good time, kid.
This is going to
be a real party.

811
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,055
Is this a party?
The beer is warm,
the women are cold...

812
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:45,390
and I'm hot under the collar.

813
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:48,601
In fact, a more
poisonous little barbecue
I've never attended.

814
00:53:48,686 --> 00:53:51,437
You're a funny kind of
a duck, but I like you.

815
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:54,023
You stuck by me,
and I'll stick by you.

816
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:56,818
Sheriff, I ain't much
on flowery sentiments...

817
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:59,070
but there's something
I just got to tell you.

818
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,739
Shucks, man, I'd be nothing
but a poisonous varmint...

819
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:03,908
and not fit to touch
the hem of your pants...

820
00:54:03,993 --> 00:54:07,412
if I didn't tell you
you've treated me square,
mighty square...

821
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:09,247
and I ain't forgetting.

822
00:54:13,669 --> 00:54:16,254
Sheriff, I ain't forgetting.

823
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:22,552
Whoa, there, Bossie.
Whoa, there!

824
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:37,734
My friends,
this is indeed a surprise.

825
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:41,404
You couldn't have
pleased me better.

826
00:54:41,572 --> 00:54:47,327
I want you to meet
the sweetest little thing
in the whole wide world.

827
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,545
Hey.
Yes, sir?

828
00:54:57,963 --> 00:55:01,507
No, it's special for
Mr. Helton, sir.

829
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:03,301
You see this?

830
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,520
Come back in a half hour,
and I'll give you
another look at it.

831
00:55:25,074 --> 00:55:27,241
Listen.
Keep your eye on Helton.

832
00:55:27,326 --> 00:55:30,078
We're gonna grab his daughter
and take her to the old barn.

833
00:55:30,162 --> 00:55:32,538
Old barn?
A fine tinhorn sport you are.

834
00:55:32,623 --> 00:55:36,000
With all
the good shows in town,
taking a girl to an old barn!

835
00:55:36,085 --> 00:55:39,087
Once we get
a hold of that girl,
he'll take orders from me.

836
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:41,005
I'll show him—
Enough small talk.

837
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,298
Where's your wife, Lucille?

838
00:55:42,424 --> 00:55:43,633
Would you... .

839
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,551
Someone's coming.
I'll be back.

840
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:48,596
Be back next Thursday,
and bring a specimen
of your handwriting.

841
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:50,515
And, above all, don't worry.

842
00:56:15,207 --> 00:56:16,708
What brought you here?

843
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:20,211
It's midsummer madness.
The music is in my temples...

844
00:56:20,337 --> 00:56:24,215
the hot blood of youth.
Come, Kapellmeister.
Let the violas throb.

845
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:26,217
My regiment leaves at dawn.

846
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:03,921
I guess my regiment
can go without me.

847
00:57:07,176 --> 00:57:10,094
No, don't,
my husband might be inside.

848
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:12,180
If he finds me out here,
he'll wallop me.

849
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:14,140
Always thinking
of your husband.

850
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:16,225
Couldn't I wallop
you just as well?

851
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:19,270
I heard Alky
talking about this party.

852
00:57:19,396 --> 00:57:21,939
I've dreamed of a night
like this, I tell you.

853
00:57:22,024 --> 00:57:23,941
You tell me about
some of your dreams.

854
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:26,277
Dreams?
I can't even sleep anymore,

855
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,696
wondering who he's
chasing around with.

856
00:57:28,781 --> 00:57:31,824
Why can't we break
away from all this,
just you and I...

857
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:34,118
and lodge with my
fleas in the hills?

858
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:36,537
I mean, flee to my
lodge in the hills.

859
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:38,122
No, I couldn't think of it.

860
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:41,042
Don't be afraid.
You can join this
lodge for a few pennies.

861
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:43,628
You won't even have to take
a physical examination...

862
00:57:43,712 --> 00:57:45,463
unless you insist on one.

863
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,925
What a swell
home life I've got.

864
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:52,720
Why, I think I'd
almost marry you

865
00:57:52,846 --> 00:57:55,139
to spite that
double-crossing crook.

866
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:58,518
Mrs. Briggs...

867
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:02,396
I've known and respected your
husband Alky for many years...

868
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:05,608
and what's good enough for him
is good enough for me.

869
00:58:14,743 --> 00:58:16,410
Emily!

870
00:58:17,496 --> 00:58:19,747
Henry, carefully,
somebody may see us.

871
00:58:19,832 --> 00:58:21,582
I've been careful too long.

872
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,418
Now that you've brought it up,
how long have
you been careful?

873
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:27,380
They saw us!
Be calm, Emily.
I'll talk to them.

874
00:58:27,464 --> 00:58:29,173
You won't say
anything about this?

875
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:31,926
Sir,
are you trying to offer me
a bribe? How much?

876
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,930
But you don't understand.
You see, I'm not
happy with my husband.

877
00:58:36,014 --> 00:58:38,099
He should've married
some little housewife.

878
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:41,561
Madam, I resent that.
Some of my best
friends are housewives.

879
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:45,439
Now, see here,
if you're going to—

880
00:58:45,524 --> 00:58:47,441
You're living in
a fool's paradise.

881
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:50,862
You intend to spend $10 to buy
this woman a ring?
Look at this.

882
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:53,531
It's solid brass and
$1.50 takes it away.

883
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:56,742
I know it'll fit her.
I got it from
the nose of a savage.

884
00:58:56,827 --> 00:58:59,954
Well? $1.50.
You can have it for $1.

885
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:03,082
Fifty cents and
not a nickel under.

886
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:05,042
Now, my friends,
what am I offered for

887
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:07,003
this fine French
piece of bric-a-brac?

888
00:59:07,087 --> 00:59:08,963
I know what it
is to be unhappy.

889
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:11,424
How do you think I feel?
I'm stuck with this ring.

890
00:59:11,508 --> 00:59:14,218
I've been
married for four years,
four years of neglect...

891
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,804
four years of battling,
four years of heartbreaks.

892
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:19,765
That makes 12 years.
You must've been
married in rompers.

893
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,601
Mighty pretty
country around there.

894
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,477
Do you think
you'll ever go back?

895
00:59:23,562 --> 00:59:25,396
Come here, babe. I like you.

896
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,899
I shouldn't.
What about my husband?

897
00:59:27,983 --> 00:59:30,902
That's all right.
Maybe we can get
a girl for him.

898
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:40,328
Who was that? My wife?

899
00:59:40,412 --> 00:59:42,455
Married to her 12
years and you ask me?

900
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:44,832
What're you doing here?
I told you to spy on Helton.

901
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:46,626
I did spy on him.
What was he doing?

902
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,669
He was spying on me.
Did he see you?

903
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:51,672
No. I was too foxy for him.
All he could do was spy on me.

904
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:54,467
Well, get back in there.
We're all set to cop his girl.

905
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:55,927
Okay, chief.

906
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,369
They got some
good stuff outside.
You want a drink?

907
01:00:25,874 --> 01:00:28,125
Ready, boys? Let's go.

908
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:19,010
Beat you that time.

909
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:21,113
Very swell.
Let me get you some punch.

910
01:02:21,198 --> 01:02:22,907
I'd love it.

911
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,794
Just what I needed.

912
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:51,143
Well, how's it coming, kid?

913
01:02:51,228 --> 01:02:52,520
Got everything you want?

914
01:02:52,604 --> 01:02:54,397
Sure, how about
a job for my grandfather?

915
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:56,107
Your grandfather,
what does he do?

916
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:58,025
He puts cheese
in the mousetraps.

917
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,361
Why, we haven't got
any mice here.

918
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:02,571
He brings his
own mice with him.

919
01:03:17,421 --> 01:03:19,422
You know,
Mary, everyone seems to be

920
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:21,590
having nearly as
much fun as I am.

921
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:25,594
I beg your pardon,
but there's someone
to see you, Miss Helton.

922
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:27,596
Pardon me,
and I'll hurry right back.

923
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:29,140
Surely.

924
01:03:49,453 --> 01:03:51,454
No, you're wrong,
girls, you're wrong.

925
01:03:51,538 --> 01:03:54,832
In the first place,
Gary Cooper is
much taller than I am.

926
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:58,919
I wish you'd
announce this singer.
I can't make out the name.

927
01:03:59,004 --> 01:04:01,088
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wish to announce...

928
01:04:01,173 --> 01:04:04,300
that the buffet will be served
in the next room
in five minutes.

929
01:04:04,384 --> 01:04:06,093
To get you in
that room quickly...

930
01:04:06,178 --> 01:04:09,305
Mrs. Schmalhausen
will sing a soprano solo
in this room.

931
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:44,084
That's no good.
You wanna get
thrown out again?

932
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:46,420
Play something nice.
I tell you what you play.

933
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:48,297
Play... .

934
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:55,512
That's it.

935
01:06:55,597 --> 01:06:58,932
That's beautiful.
That's magnifico. I like that.

936
01:09:03,183 --> 01:09:06,018
Mary! They've kidnapped her!

937
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:07,436
Who's been kidnapped?

938
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,230
Mary, my daughter!
Do something!

939
01:09:10,315 --> 01:09:11,648
But who could've done it?

940
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:15,527
It's that Alky Briggs!
You saw them drag
her into the car.

941
01:09:15,612 --> 01:09:17,905
Where did they take her?

942
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:20,240
First, they
blindfolded me and then they—

943
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:22,326
Of course,
they took her to the barn.

944
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:25,579
Fellows,
let's all pack up a lunch
and go down to the old barn.

945
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:28,040
Fred, you go down
to the North Road.

946
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:30,584
Jack, you head
down by Front Street.

947
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:32,961
I'll go pick up
a couple of the boys.

948
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:35,464
And I'll take
care of picking up
a couple of dames.

949
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:37,591
Women?
This is no time for women.

950
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:39,176
On to the barn!

951
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,722
Gee, I wish I had a horse.

952
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:49,895
Hurry it up, boys.

953
01:09:50,355 --> 01:09:51,605
Come on.

954
01:09:57,028 --> 01:09:59,863
Let me go!

955
01:10:00,031 --> 01:10:03,242
No use yelling, kid.
Nobody will hear you in here.

956
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:05,452
You wait till my
father hears about this!

957
01:10:05,537 --> 01:10:08,622
He's gonna hear about it
because I'm gonna
tell him myself.

958
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:10,249
Take it easy!

959
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:13,168
You're not going anyplace.
Don't get all excited.
Come on.

960
01:10:13,253 --> 01:10:15,587
You take your hands off of me!

961
01:10:15,672 --> 01:10:17,631
Listen, kid.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

962
01:10:17,715 --> 01:10:20,092
You'll be out in an hour
if your dad comes through.

963
01:10:20,176 --> 01:10:22,177
Butch, you take
care of the girl while
I telephone Joe.

964
01:10:22,303 --> 01:10:24,346
Come on, you guys.

965
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:38,402
You take your hands off of me!

966
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:42,447
Now, make yourself
at home, but shut up!

967
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:52,916
$1.10.

968
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:54,543
Here's $1.
Keep the change.

969
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:56,211
But I said $1.10.

970
01:10:56,337 --> 01:10:57,921
Give me $1.
I'll keep the change.

971
01:10:58,006 --> 01:11:00,090
That's a half
a dollar I owe you.

972
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:10,684
You call this a barn?
This looks like a stable.

973
01:11:10,768 --> 01:11:13,395
It looks like a barn
but smells like a stable.

974
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:15,731
Well, let's just look at it.

975
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:18,066
Get out of here!

976
01:11:18,234 --> 01:11:20,110
Have you got
a girl in that hayloft?

977
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:21,278
No!

978
01:11:21,362 --> 01:11:22,988
You're a bigger
fool than I thought.

979
01:11:23,072 --> 01:11:24,656
Beat it, I tell you!

980
01:11:24,782 --> 01:11:26,116
What'd you say?

981
01:11:26,284 --> 01:11:27,618
I said beat it!

982
01:11:30,663 --> 01:11:32,039
Pardon me.
What did you say?

983
01:11:32,165 --> 01:11:33,582
I said beat it!

984
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:34,833
He said beat it.

985
01:11:34,918 --> 01:11:38,003
Gee, I wish I'd said that.
Everybody's repeating it.

986
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:40,756
I'm coming down
there and get you!

987
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,591
Don't bother.
We'll come right up.

988
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:44,343
Come on.
I'm going in to get him.

989
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,318
Here we are at the old barn,
all set for
a nice picnic lunch.

990
01:12:01,402 --> 01:12:04,613
Gosh, the picnic is off,
we haven't got any red ants.

991
01:12:04,697 --> 01:12:07,491
I know an Indian who's got
a couple of Red aunts.

992
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:09,868
Don't you think we'd better
go look for the girl?

993
01:12:09,953 --> 01:12:12,746
Let's wait till we eat,
there's hardly
enough lunch for two.

994
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:16,333
I don't see why
she couldn't get
kidnapped near a restaurant.

995
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:18,293
Some dark night,
I think I'll come

996
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:20,504
and lay for you if
the hens don't get sore.

997
01:12:22,674 --> 01:12:23,757
Here.

998
01:12:23,883 --> 01:12:27,177
Go over to that
filling station
and get some milk. Grade-A.

999
01:12:30,598 --> 01:12:32,683
Well, come on.
Where's the milk?

1000
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,143
There's
a customer ahead of me.

1001
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,522
Hey!

1002
01:12:39,524 --> 01:12:41,191
What are you doing here?

1003
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,735
What are we doing?
What about you,
kidnapping a girl?

1004
01:12:43,861 --> 01:12:45,529
Old-fashioned
piece of melodrama...

1005
01:12:45,613 --> 01:12:48,907
kidnapping a girl!
You've been reading
too many dime novels.

1006
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:51,702
Go on. You get him.
I'll wait for you outside.

1007
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,996
Keep out of this loft!

1008
01:12:54,122 --> 01:12:55,831
It's better to
have loft and lost

1009
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:57,416
than never to
have loft at all.

1010
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Nice work.

1011
01:12:58,626 --> 01:13:00,252
Beat it,
or I'll throw you out!

1012
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,576
Take your
face out of my foot!

1013
01:13:32,744 --> 01:13:34,161
I gotcha!

1014
01:13:42,879 --> 01:13:47,007
So, thought we were afraid?
Thought we were afraid,
did you?

1015
01:13:52,472 --> 01:13:55,182
Now I'm gonna give
it to you guys right!

1016
01:14:11,074 --> 01:14:13,075
Butch! What happened?

1017
01:14:13,743 --> 01:14:14,785
Hey!

1018
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:17,537
You, get out of that loft!

1019
01:14:22,043 --> 01:14:23,627
Butch, what happened?

1020
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:26,088
Come up here, Butch.

1021
01:14:33,513 --> 01:14:34,971
Where's all those
farmers' daughters

1022
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:36,973
I've been hearing
about for years?

1023
01:14:43,314 --> 01:14:46,900
Why don't you boys
fight over there?
You want to break my glasses?

1024
01:14:48,528 --> 01:14:49,986
Come on, folks.
Step right up.

1025
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:52,656
Only 10 cents a chance.
Attaboy!
Here you are.

1026
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:55,534
Ten cents gets you in
the only game in the stable.

1027
01:14:55,618 --> 01:14:58,161
Let's see. Number 16 wins.
And the lucky number.

1028
01:14:58,246 --> 01:15:01,957
There you are, young man.
Sorry you didn't
get a better one.

1029
01:15:03,543 --> 01:15:04,918
Here we go!

1030
01:15:05,002 --> 01:15:09,422
Let's see what comes up.
Well, if he isn't
the lucky guy. Double 0.

1031
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:11,383
Two shots for
the price of one.

1032
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:13,426
Folks, this is
the best game in all—

1033
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:18,056
You're a mother,
you understand.

1034
01:15:18,141 --> 01:15:19,516
How would you like
to have somebody...

1035
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,435
steal one of your heifers?
I know, heifer cow
is better than none...

1036
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,814
but this is no time for puns.
Get in that battle over there.

1037
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:30,193
Here we are again
at the ringside,

1038
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,862
and it looks
like a great battle.

1039
01:15:31,946 --> 01:15:34,364
Now the boys are locked
in the center of the ring.

1040
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:37,951
What a grudge fight.
Zowie! Zowie! Zowie!

1041
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:41,037
That makes three zowies,
and a man gets
a base on balls.

1042
01:15:41,122 --> 01:15:45,083
Ending of the first inning.
No runs, no errors,
but plenty of hits.

1043
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:51,047
This program comes
to you courtesy of

1044
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:52,632
the Golden Goose
Furniture Company...

1045
01:15:52,717 --> 01:15:57,012
with three stores:
125th Street, 125th Street
and 125th Street.

1046
01:15:57,096 --> 01:15:59,764
You furnish the girl,
we tar and feather your nest.

1047
01:15:59,849 --> 01:16:02,142
Look for our advertisement
in today's ash can.

1048
01:16:02,226 --> 01:16:05,604
Now the boys are at it
in the center of the ring!
Oh! That one hurt!

1049
01:16:05,688 --> 01:16:08,064
Come on, you palookas!
Stop stalling!

1050
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:10,609
Oh, mama,
if I only had my youth again.

1051
01:16:23,164 --> 01:16:24,539
Round two.

1052
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:28,835
Both boys are
fiddling in the ring,

1053
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:30,670
and I don't think
much of the tune.

1054
01:16:30,755 --> 01:16:32,255
Briggs is bobbing and weaving.

1055
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,090
It's nice work
if you can get it.

1056
01:16:34,217 --> 01:16:35,967
Now they're trying.
Very trying.

1057
01:16:36,052 --> 01:16:37,552
I copped that one
from an almanac.

1058
01:16:37,637 --> 01:16:41,181
Now they're in
the center of the ring,
and the crowd hurrahs.

1059
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:57,948
Oh, Dad!

1060
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,076
Are you all right, honey?

1061
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,539
Good boy.
Remember, old Joe Helton
never forgot a friend.

1062
01:17:06,624 --> 01:17:09,334
This is one job that
certainly was a pleasure.

1063
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:12,796
What are you doing?

1064
01:17:12,922 --> 01:17:14,631
I'm looking for
a needle in a hay stack.
