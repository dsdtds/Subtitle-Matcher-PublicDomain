15
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,525
Tequila.

16
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,043
- Is he having a dance?
- Five-ace card player.

17
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:51,825
Five dollars he doesn't last another minute.

18
00:02:54,458 --> 00:03:00,311
- Cut him down.
- You stay out of this, Yank.

19
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:00,629
 We'll cut him down when he quits kicking.

20
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:12,558
Billy... Get in, boy!

21
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,552
Where have you been, Billy?

22
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,986
 You'd better ride with us.

23
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:59,008
There ain't no Yellowleg Yankee boy goin' with us!

24
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:03,502
I hear they got a new bank and an old marshal over at Gila City.

25
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:09,312
- That beats cheatin' at cards, don't it?
- Let's go.

26
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:34,069
The town looks quiet.

27
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,110
Yeah, I bet the marshal's asleep.

28
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,088
Ever shoot a man in his sleep, Yellowlegs? You bein' a Yankee?

29
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,471
He ain't very sociable, is he?

30
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:45,585
Been with us a week and ain't lost his temper once.

31
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,216
I never did trust a man who didn't lose his temper. Let's go.

32
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,312
We ain't takin' the bank today.

33
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:56,551
Are you givin' the orders now?
- Looks that way, don't it?

34
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:03,988
- Billy, get him in the back.
- No, Turkey, that ain't my style.

35
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,246
Come on, he's askin' for it, boy.

36
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:10,258
Any man that'd turn his back on you is just a dag blam fool.

37
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,850
I kinda like him.

38
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,442
I never knowed a Yankee before.

39
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,086
Your horse needs a shoe.

40
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:48,217
There's a blacksmith's shop.

41
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:52,439
- How long do you figure that money's gonna keep?
- Till I tell you when.

42
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:57,038
- I'm kinda anxious to get my hands on it.
- Take care of your horse first.

43
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,678
I was figurin' on havin' a couple of drinks with you fellas.

44
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:28,389
I sure hope this town has some pretty girls in it.

45
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,154
When you get this far out in the brush, they're all pretty.

46
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,087
Billy, take the horses round to the livery stables.

47
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,858
Are you talkin' to me?

48
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,994
Your name's Billy, ain't it?

49
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,174
I'll take the horses for you, mister.

50
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,479
Well, you look like an honest man.

51
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:08,560
You know, some folks is just born lucky, I guess.

52
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,653
Doggone it, you know, don't push yours!

53
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,940
What's going on here?

54
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,364
These don't look too pretty to me.

55
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:28,499
I told you, you ain't been out here long enough.

56
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:38,281
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Put that thing back up.

57
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:41,917
- That'll have to wait, gents.
- Wait? Wait for what?

58
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:48,982
Church is about to start. The parson don't like to look at it during his sermon.

59
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:55,169
- This ain't Sunday, is it?
- That's a matter of opinion in Gila City.

60
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:01,313
We haven't seen a calendar in two years. Some folks hold it's Monday, but these folks hold it's Sunday.

61
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:04,371
- Are you gents lookin' for a drink?

62
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,520
- I'm lookin' right at it. What's in that bottle?

63
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,173
- Best we've got. Even the Mayor drinks it.

64
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,843
- That'll have to do.

65
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:15,496
- Tell me somethin'. How about the bank?

66
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,366
- The bank's open. They're Monday folks.

67
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:21,131
The bar's closed when the parson walks in.

68
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:28,293
Howdy, mister!

69
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:30,616
Hello, boy.

70
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:33,584
Hey, that's what I call pretty.

71
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,980
- Who's she, the redhead?
- Works over at the dance hall across the street.

72
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,247
Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable and bringin' her woods colt with her!

73
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:02,260
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again.

74
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,273
- Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson.

75
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:09,951
And her holding a prayer book like she was respectable!

76
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:13,923
If they're going to heaven, let's you and me not go!

77
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:18,562
Gents, the bar is closed.

78
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:29,545
Number 23.

79
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:37,833
# Rock of ages, cleft for me

80
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,762
# Let me hide myself in thee

81
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:45,441
# Let the water and the blood

82
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:48,994
# From thy wounded side which flowed

83
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:52,672
# Be of sin the double cure

84
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,309
# Save from wrath and make me pure

85
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:59,946
# Could my tears forever flow

86
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:03,499
# Could my zeal no languor know

87
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:07,261
# All for sin could not atone... #

88
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,030
- What are y'all drinkin'?
- No drinkin'. The bar's closed on account of the church meeting.

89
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,189
- Whisky. -
 I told them the bar's...

90
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,380
Billy, show 'em those six-shooters!

91
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,850
See how fast you can take the cork out of that bottle.

92
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,619
I wanna tell you somethin'. He's fast with them six-shooters. This boy's a real comin' boy.

93
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:29,750
I taught him everythin' I know.

94
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:39,198
- What's the matter?
- You'll have to stand and look at that bottle all the way through the sermon.

95
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:44,172
# Let me hide myself in thee... #

96
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:50,944
Lord, I see you sent us some new faces today.

97
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,992
Male...

98
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:55,626
and female.

99
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,011
Lord, I thank you,

100
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:02,105
and folks, I welcome you.

101
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,246
And I'll be dishin' out the gospels in a minute.

102
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:11,092
But first, I've got to say a word to you gents with your hats on.

103
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:19,327
This here is a preach-house, gents, and you'll take your hats off to the Lord.

104
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:33,999
Mister, I never met a man who wouldn't take off his hat to the Lord.

105
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,131
Let's get it off.

106
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,601
You get on with your preachin'.

107
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:52,350
- He's touchy about that hat.
- I've never seen nothin' like it. He don't even take it off to sleep.

108
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:56,823
We'll have a moment of silent prayer.

109
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,264
All that money just sittin' out there across the street.

110
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:22,698
I've never known a man so hungry for money. I think you're studyin' up to be a miser.

111
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:26,084
Studyin' up to buy us an army. Don't you remember?

112
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,261
- Still dreamin' about that?
- It ain't such a dream.

113
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:34,528
We could set up our own republic on this country. It's wide open. Nobody can stop us.

114
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:40,255
Take that bank money and the Comancheros will sell us 100, maybe 200 slave Indians.

115
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,386
We put uniforms on 'em.

116
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,518
Yeah, fix us up an army.

117
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:46,650
And I could drill 'em.

118
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:51,834
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hooray, hooray

119
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,843
# When Johnny comes marching home again... #

120
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,438
Left face, right face...

121
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:01,490
# Johnny comes marching... #

122
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,429
Raise this arm.

123
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,561
Raise it. Higher.

124
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,615
All right.

125
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,879
- Has it always pained you that way?
- Almost always.

126
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,432
That ball ought to come out of there.

127
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,564
That's what I'm here for.

128
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:31,088
- Have you ever been in Springfield, Ohio?
- No.

129
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:35,478
I'll swear I've seen you someplace before.

130
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:37,191
Here...

131
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,574
How long will this lay me up?

132
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:47,767
- It's pretty close to the collarbone. A thing like that won't heal overnight, you know.
- What, a week?

133
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:50,192
More like a month.

134
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:54,497
Well, I got a little business to attend to.

135
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:56,796
I don't think it can wait that long.

136
00:13:56,796 --> 00:13:58,928
Then stop wasting my time.

137
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:11,469
Wait a minute.

138
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:15,691
Missoura. That's where it was.

139
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:18,784
A fella just about your size, Yellowleg sergeant.

140
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:24,427
Somebody had tried to scalp him. A liquored-up Johnny Reb with a Bowie knife.

141
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:29,443
He cut the sergeant up pretty badly before he was scared off by something.

142
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:34,501
You know, if you take off your hat, you could make me out a liar.

143
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:40,688
It's you, all right.

144
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:51,849
You certainly went out of your way to look me up, didn't you? Take off the hat.

145
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:56,238
I've kind of got used to keeping it on.

146
00:14:56,238 --> 00:15:03,052
Why? You haven't got anything to hide but a few battle scars.
 A lot of the boys came out with worse than that.

147
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:07,148
- What did you do after the war ended?
- What would YOU do?

148
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:10,242
- I'd go after that Reb.

149
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:18,644
Is that Reb in town?

150
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:26,419
Well, what are you waiting for?

151
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,551
I'm waiting to get him alone.

152
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,773
You see, I want him to know who I am.

153
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:36,242
I want him to know he's gonna get what he gave me.

154
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:38,499
Are you sure you found the right man?

155
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:43,307
Yeah, I'm sure. I left my teeth marks in his scalping hand.

156
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,274
And I'm askin' you, my friends...

157
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:53,088
Any man, woman or child that reckons that he wants to go to hell,

158
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:57,770
I say let that man, woman or child stand up and be counted!

159
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:05,001
What?

160
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,844
Start countin', Parson. Get up, Turk.

161
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:15,703
You white-livered coyote, you're saying you intend to go to that place?

162
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:18,880
I sure do, Parson. I'll tell you somethin' else.

163
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,854
Any man that don't get on his feet right now and join me is goin' there pronto!

164
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:41,870
Well, nice to meet you, ma'am. My name's Billy. Billy Keplinger.

165
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,960
Get out!

166
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,700
Come on, Turkey!

167
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,819
Sure is a pretty girl.

168
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,842
Ma'am, I want to thank you for your fortitude.

169
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:14,980
We'll all close with a prayer now

170
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,077
for those poor, misguided men.

171
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:23,926
All that money just sittin' there, waitin' on a Yellowlegged Yankee.

172
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:27,479
I never saw a man so patient about robbin' a bank!

173
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,611
Oh, church meeting's over.

174
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,331
You have a nice afternoon.

175
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,550
Thank you again, ma'am.

176
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:05,686
Let me know when that Yankee's patience runs out.

177
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:11,329
If his patience ever does wear out.

178
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:25,541
That pretty redhead that just went in holds that today is Sunday.

179
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,760
What do you lovely creatures feel about that?

180
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,268
I think it's Monday.

181
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:33,484
- Get your horse.
- Huh?

182
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,448
Get it.

183
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,538
Èíáí

184
00:18:41,802 --> 00:18:45,272
Hey, Billy! Yellowleg's ready.

185
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:14,700
Somethin' wrong with that Yankee's shootin' arm.

186
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:51,025
Somebody get the doc.

187
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,961
He's dead.

188
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:05,990
It was them outlaws, Kit. They did some wild shootin'.

189
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,431
No.

190
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,736
It was me.

191
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:40,142
- 'Is she the dance hall woman?
- That's her.

192
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:45,409
'Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable, bringin' her woods colt with her!

193
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,464
- 'Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again.

194
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:53,686
- 'Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson.

195
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:57,866
'And her holding the prayer book like she was respectable!'

196
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:26,667
That Yellowleg sure has been tryin' to get hisself drunk.

197
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,883
He ain't quite makin' it though.

198
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:31,641
Some men are like that. Give me two.

199
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:34,066
The boy's leanin' awful hard on him.

200
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:39,333
You reckon the Mayor will be able to talk that redhead into changin' her mind?

201
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,674
Ain't nothin' gonna change her mind.

202
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:47,568
She got Doc Acton to take care of the body and rented herself a wagon. She's goin' tonight.

203
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,950
Goin' alone if she has to.

204
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:13,777
We've come to change your mind, Kit.

205
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:17,874
We've decided to have a nice funeral for the boy in Gila City.

206
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:21,009
The whole town will come. As Mayor, I'll see to it.

207
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:26,109
Mead will be buried in Siringo next to his father.

208
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:28,659
Now, Kit...

209
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:33,549
Bury him here? You think I haven't heard all the whispering?

210
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:39,820
- You and your gossiping little wives with their pinched little faces and their noses in the air!
- Miss Kit...

211
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,042
"That dance hall woman with her freckle-faced woods colt.

212
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:46,675
"No telling who the father might be!"

213
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:50,940
They smell brimstone every time I walk by.

214
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,574
They hated us both, me and the boy.

215
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,706
Well, he's dead now

216
00:22:55,706 --> 00:23:00,179
and you can tell your wives that there was no sinning

217
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,394
and there'll be no funeral.

218
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,944
I'm taking him to Siringo.

219
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:11,172
You can't do that.
It's smack in the middle of Apache country and there ain't nobody willing to go with you.

220
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:15,687
Besides, there's not much of it left but the weeds.

221
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:18,864
I've tried, Kit. I've asked everybody.

222
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:24,005
I'm not asking anybody to go with me.

223
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:31,362
Poor Kit. She's trying mighty hard to make folk believe about the boy's pa.

224
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:33,543
- Are you a single man?
- Married.

225
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:37,675
- I didn't know that, Cal.
Well, almost married.

226
00:23:37,675 --> 00:23:41,771
Me and Emma. She wouldn't let me go with Kit. Not that way.

227
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:44,237
Not to mention the Apaches.

228
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,893
I ain't never seen a town so full of cowards.

229
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:59,286
I ain't never seen a town so scared of Indians.

230
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:03,550
You can take three.

231
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,338
ßíÊ ¿

232
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:33,145
I hate to think what all that sun will do to your face.

233
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,277
Will you take this?

234
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:37,409
No, thanks, Cal.

235
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,087
Take it. I've got no use for it. I can't sell it.

236
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,637
Imported all the way from St Louis.

237
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,454
Get down from there!

238
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:08,844
I said get down!

239
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:12,313
- Somebody's got to drive this for you.
- Not you.

240
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:14,403
I'm askin' to.

241
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:16,702
I said get down!

242
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:21,969
Need any help, ma'am?

243
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:29,368
- Get out of here, Billy.
- I didn't mean to butt in...

244
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:32,545
Your place.

245
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:37,101
Get down.

246
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:17,482
I bet she don't get 20 miles before she turns around.

247
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,658
50 dollars.

248
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:25,800
And a call.

249
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,932
What have you got?

250
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,492
You lose to four aces.

251
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:43,566
- We're leaving town.
- You're a little premature, Yellowleg.

252
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:45,948
Get your horses.

253
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:52,929
Billy and me like this town. We're stickin' around. You'd better leave alone cos we ain't leavin'.

254
00:26:58,489 --> 00:27:01,039
It wasn't me that shot that boy.

255
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,589
Get up. Get up!

256
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,431
Looks like you and me is gonna go to Siringo.

257
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:08,563
Billy, you and I ain't leavin' here.

258
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,666
I'm just backin' him up.

259
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:19,097
Yeah, I kinda like the idea of going to Siringo with that redhead.

260
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:50,753
Come on. What's the matter?

261
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:53,721
Come on!

262
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:02,541
I guess you don't mind the Yellowleg orderin' you around, but I don't like it.

263
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:07,599
But if I could handle that six-shooter like you, Billy boy...

264
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,821
His back's pointin' right at ya. What's the matter? Scared?

265
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:15,625
Scared he might hear your gun comin' out of the holster?

266
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:20,056
That ain't no fit way to kill a man.

267
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:22,773
Not even a Yankee.

268
00:28:52,744 --> 00:28:54,793
There she is.

269
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:36,594
- Good morning, ma'am.
- You'll kill your horse pushin' him like that.

270
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:41,067
- Will you let me drive that wagon for you?
- I don't want YOUR help!

271
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:45,832
Well, I'd be mighty proud to ride in that wagon with you, ma'am.

272
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:48,299
Leave me alone!

273
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,823
Both of you.

274
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:02,135
Well, now, you know it ain't exactly safe out here for a woman?

275
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:05,312
Well, it ain't exactly safe for you either.

276
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:09,241
Any of you. Now git!

277
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:12,920
Why don't you leave this woman be and let's head back?

278
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:30,100
Listen, that bank is probably just now opening up.

279
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,525
Yeah, it probably is, probably is.

280
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:35,911
We'll follow along and see she gets through.

281
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:40,216
Turkey, that's a woman!

282
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:15,789
Come on, let's go.

283
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,491
Your dress is kinda wet. I guess you're gonna have to dry it out.

284
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,999
It shouldn't take long in this heat.

285
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,038
I never did see a dance-hall girl so touchy about gettin' kissed.

286
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,382
You stay away from me.

287
00:32:10,382 --> 00:32:13,559
What will you do with that rock? Use it on me?

288
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,900
Or a shotgun if I have to!

289
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,662
Well, ma'am, I always did go for high stakes.

290
00:32:46,457 --> 00:32:48,170
ÇÈÇÊÔí

291
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,720
They scalped him.

292
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:55,569
Yeah. It looks like they did.

293
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,926
Come on, let's get back to that wagon.

294
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,621
Hey, the coffee's ready!

295
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:41,007
It's plain to see that woman don't want us round here,
 so why don't we accommodate her by leaving?

296
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:52,837
Did you desert?

297
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:59,358
- Hmm?
- Did you desert the Rebel Army?

298
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:02,535
I don't remember telling you I was in the army.

299
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:05,211
I figured you for a deserter.

300
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,969
How did you guess?

301
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:12,735
Maybe I ought to take her a cup of coffee before it gets cold.

302
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:14,908
Leave her alone.

303
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:19,381
Are you... Are you talkin' to me?

304
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:25,401
Hey, Billy, I think Yellowleg's kinda taken a shine to that woman.

305
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:29,706
- And we thought he was feelin' sorry about that boy.
- Shut up!

306
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:32,214
- Touchy too.
- Yeah.

307
00:34:32,214 --> 00:34:35,726
Like he is about that hat he keeps wearin'.

308
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:39,237
- You know what I think he's got under it?
- What's that?

309
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:41,076
Money.

310
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:44,420
Well, there's one way we could find out.

311
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,719
We can ask him...

312
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,269
Take your hat off, Yellowlegs.

313
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:52,112
He's scared of you, Billy.

314
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,122
Yellowlegs...

315
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:59,469
Take your hat off or I'll shoot it off.

316
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:05,655
You try it and I'll kill you.

317
00:35:09,752 --> 00:35:13,890
Yellowlegs, there's something about you I just gotta like.

318
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:40,183
Better mind your thinkin', kid. Yellowleg has done got his claim staked out.

319
00:35:43,277 --> 00:35:49,004
We could go back to that bank. That posse would never follow us out here, not to Siringo.

320
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:58,994
We could set up our own little republic like that Edward fella did down in Texas.

321
00:35:58,994 --> 00:36:01,419
You know, the republic of Freedonia?

322
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:07,104
All this land out here, just a-waitin'. Think how you'd look in a gold braid uniform!

323
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:11,075
You're the kind of trigger-happy young fella I can use.

324
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:13,207
I'd make you my military aide.

325
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:18,265
Then we'd start makin' up a lot of laws, but not one of them would apply to us.

326
00:36:18,265 --> 00:36:22,487
- They don't now. They never did.
- There's money in a thing like this.

327
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:28,297
If it's run right. But we've got to start first with that bank back in Gila City.

328
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:32,477
Turkey, don't you ever shut up? You nag like an old woman!

329
00:36:32,477 --> 00:36:35,570
It's sure quiet out here, isn't it?

330
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:40,590
I don't blame you for feelin' the way you do,

331
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:46,567
but right now, it might be a good idea if you could make out like we were getting along.

332
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:54,719
Are you always that stubborn or just hard to figure out?

333
00:36:58,314 --> 00:36:59,902
Lady...

334
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:02,118
I'm just tryin' to help.

335
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:08,012
Who are you trying to help?

336
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:14,198
Riding shotgun on this wagon isn't going to buy you a clean conscience!

337
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:23,436
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever figured on going to Siringo at all.

338
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:26,780
What are you trying to say?

339
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,459
I mean, right here is as good as Siringo for the boy.

340
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:35,475
You don't have to prove anything to me.

341
00:37:35,475 --> 00:37:37,440
Damn you!

342
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:43,835
- Look at 'em fightin'!
- Yeah.

343
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,820
You don't know me well enough to hate me that much.

344
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:58,090
Hating is a subject I know a little something about.

345
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,685
You've got to be careful it don't bite you back.

346
00:38:01,685 --> 00:38:05,907
I know somebody who spent five years looking for a man he hated.

347
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:09,920
Hating and wanting revenge was all that kept him alive.

348
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:14,936
He spent all them years tracking that other man down,

349
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:18,949
and when he caught up with him, it was the worst day in his life.

350
00:38:20,997 --> 00:38:23,547
He'd get his revenge all right,

351
00:38:23,547 --> 00:38:27,351
but then he'd lose the one thing he had to live for.

352
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,750
- What was that for?
- I was just checking my aim.

353
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,262
Nothing like letting the Apaches know where we are!

354
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:10,490
That ain't no fit way to kill a man, not even a Yankee.

355
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:16,300
You go on up ahead and find us a place to camp.

356
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,648
- There might be some Apaches out there.
- Then you go find out.

357
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:29,510
You know, you could get the sun here.

358
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,892
I'll get used to it.

359
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:36,240
We'll be leaving you in Siringo. You can find your own way back.

360
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:28,324
Come on.

361
00:42:04,342 --> 00:42:08,188
Turk, what are you doin' out here? This ain't your guard.

362
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,622
I want to show you somethin'.

363
00:42:16,172 --> 00:42:20,227
I've been carryin' this around with me for a long while.

364
00:42:20,227 --> 00:42:23,362
- What's that?
- It's a genuine general's cap.

365
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:28,462
I stole it over at San Antonio. I never did show it to anybody before.

366
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:40,292
A man sure really looks like something wearin' one of these, don't he, boy?

367
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:46,227
If you're waitin' for me to salute you, you're gonna wait a long time.

368
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:52,205
Here, I want to show you something else.

369
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:57,514
Here... Come here.

370
00:42:57,514 --> 00:42:59,646
See that part right there?

371
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,839
It's not on a regular map. A valley. Not many people know it's there.

372
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:14,151
We're gonna buy ourselves some slave Indians.
 We're gonna put uniforms on and we're gonna fill 'em good.

373
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:19,501
We'll be able to burn a fire path through this country from Tucson to Tucumcari.

374
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:21,884
What do you say, boy? Huh?

375
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,521
What do you say to that, huh?

376
00:43:25,521 --> 00:43:27,778
Fine, Turk, fine.

377
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:36,306
Take over my guard for me, will you?

378
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,422
I never travelled with a lady before.

379
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:14,721
It kinda appeals to me.

380
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:18,441
- Get out of my way.
- Maybe I will and maybe I won't.

381
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:21,409
I'm telling you to leave me alone.

382
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,171
I don't wanna... I don't wanna trouble you, Kit.

383
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:29,393
I just wanna be sociable.

384
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:34,201
And I never wear my guns when I make a social call.

385
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:44,985
I always did like pretty things and...

386
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:48,998
You're just about the prettiest I've ever seen.

387
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:09,633
Saddle up.

388
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:13,103
Come on, get out of here.

389
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:20,544
- I'm goin' with you, Billy.
- You ain't goin' no place.

390
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:26,856
- He wouldn't stand a chance in Apache country alone.
- That's his lookout.

391
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,800
ÊíÑß

392
00:48:33,263 --> 00:48:36,231
He's gone.

393
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:04,280
- They'll be going back to Gila City, both of them. I'll drive you back if you want.
- No, thanks.

394
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:07,624
You still going to Siringo?

395
00:49:07,624 --> 00:49:11,971
- You think you can stop me?
- Lady, I wouldn't even try.

396
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:48,282
I'm sorry about losing the horse.

397
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:54,597
- Well, you don't have to talk to me, you know!
- It ain't worth the effort.

398
00:50:57,231 --> 00:51:04,170
Five years is a long time to turn your back on, especially for a woman like me. 
That's what you think.

399
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:07,055
Lady, I quit thinking when I turned my horse around.

400
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,855
Stop calling me Lady! My name is Kit.

401
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:14,369
- I don't know you well enough!
- Don't think you're fooling me.

402
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:18,591
You're not half as mad at me as you are at yourself.

403
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:22,646
Gonna talk all the way to Siringo?

404
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,274
Grab that shotgun! Come on!

405
00:52:46,124 --> 00:52:50,764
Must have ambushed that stage down at the border.

406
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,870
I sure wish I could take a bath.

407
00:53:24,874 --> 00:53:27,131
Well, nothing's stopping you.

408
00:53:44,729 --> 00:53:46,736
åíÇ

409
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:51,250
Want some more?

410
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:05,379
You know...I can hardly remember what my husband looked like.

411
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:11,775
We were only married a few weeks. We were on our way to Gila City when he was...

412
00:54:13,196 --> 00:54:15,746
..he was killed in Siringo.

413
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:26,991
When Mead was born, they wouldn't believe me.

414
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:32,007
Gila City put a brand on both of us.

415
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:37,734
With their...jokes and their...talk

416
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:41,119
and their ugly little smiles.

417
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:53,200
Getting dark.

418
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,184
We've got to have another horse.

419
00:55:01,184 --> 00:55:05,824
Them Apaches can't be far off. They've got plenty of horses.

420
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:09,628
You wait right here until I get back.

421
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:44,879
ßíÊ

422
00:57:45,342 --> 00:57:48,101
Pack up. We're moving out.

423
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:03,358
That's far enough.

424
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,371
I don't think I can stay awake another minute.

425
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:09,503
You'll have to.

426
00:58:10,423 --> 00:58:12,555
Start digging.

427
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:17,278
- What?!
- We're going to bury the wagon.

428
00:58:17,278 --> 00:58:20,799
Our trail's got to look Indian.

429
00:58:20,878 --> 00:58:23,799
 If we're lucky, those Apaches are still trying to find their stagecoach.

430
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,292
Getting tired?

431
00:59:02,173 --> 00:59:04,932
I didn't ask for any help.

432
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:11,286
I wasn't offering any. I just asked if you were getting tired.

433
00:59:37,662 --> 00:59:39,886
Is Yellowleg a name?

434
00:59:41,132 --> 00:59:43,473
Well, it'll do.

435
00:59:47,193 --> 00:59:50,328
- Where are you from?
- Ohio.

436
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:54,341
Is it pretty back there?

437
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,473
Used to be.

438
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:27,866
What are you doing?

439
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:40,239
Do and I'll kill you.

440
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:13,430
ãÇ åÐÇ¿

441
01:01:16,648 --> 01:01:18,989
ÇÈÇÊÔí

442
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:26,806
- How could he miss?
- He didn't.

443
01:01:26,806 --> 01:01:29,481
Well, why didn't he kill us?

444
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:33,703
He's got a little score to settle up with me first.

445
01:01:36,086 --> 01:01:38,427
Start packing up.

446
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:58,853
- Can't forgive me for making you give up those five years, can you?
- I'll pick up his trail again.

447
01:02:58,853 --> 01:03:00,985
Hardly seemed worth the trouble.

448
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:07,297
There you go.

449
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:51,063
He broke it.

450
01:04:26,176 --> 01:04:30,147
What is he waiting for? Why doesn't he kill us?

451
01:04:30,147 --> 01:04:32,864
He will when he's ready.

452
01:04:37,922 --> 01:04:42,228
- Why don't you kill us and get it over with?! Come on!
- Stop it!

453
01:04:42,228 --> 01:04:45,202
- Leave me alone!
- Shut up!

454
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:47,202
- Why do you let him torture us?
- Shut up!

455
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:46,295
Our Apache friend's been awful quiet. Maybe he got bit by a snake.

456
01:06:56,703 --> 01:07:00,179
- Do you think it's much further?
- What?

457
01:07:00,203 --> 01:07:02,179
- Siringo.

458
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:07,195
- Siringo what?
- Do you think...?

459
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:39,174
Strange.

460
01:07:40,177 --> 01:07:44,817
I feel I know you better than any man I've ever known.

461
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:48,579
Yet I hardly know you at all.

462
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:59,324
- What are you trying to do?
- You're hurting me!

463
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:02,624
- What did you expect to find?

464
01:08:05,091 --> 01:08:09,103
I was only trying to make you more comfortable.

465
01:08:09,103 --> 01:08:11,486
I'm sorry.

466
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,995
Sorry...

467
01:08:42,088 --> 01:08:46,728
There's...some things about me you don't understand.

468
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:54,712
You killed the only person I loved in this whole world.

469
01:08:54,712 --> 01:08:57,973
That's all I need to know about YOU.

470
01:09:52,942 --> 01:09:55,700
Next time I'll be waiting for him.

471
01:10:13,383 --> 01:10:15,389
Inside.

472
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:17,395
Go on.

473
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:46,531
This'll do.

474
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,026
Here.

475
01:10:58,026 --> 01:11:01,789
You've got enough buckshot in there to stop an army.

476
01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:06,847
He ought to be on top of the bluff by sundown, so I'll wait for him.

477
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:12,699
If I'm not back by morning, you're on your own.

478
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:14,204
Wait.

479
01:11:19,763 --> 01:11:22,815
I...just wanted to say...

480
01:11:30,339 --> 01:11:32,889
..thank you.

481
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,061
Where is it? By the mission?

482
01:15:15,942 --> 01:15:18,282
What was your husband's name?

483
01:15:18,282 --> 01:15:22,755
Mead Tildon. My son was named after him.

484
01:16:34,445 --> 01:16:36,995
I couldn't find it.

485
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:46,107
It's there.

486
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:51,160
No, there ain't nobody named Tildon buried there.

487
01:16:57,681 --> 01:17:01,234
You're just the same as all the rest of them.

488
01:17:15,446 --> 01:17:17,578
Here it is.

489
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,061
It must be one of the others.

490
01:19:07,265 --> 01:19:08,770
ßíÊ

491
01:19:11,236 --> 01:19:14,288
Kit! I found it!

492
01:19:21,478 --> 01:19:23,610
I found it.

493
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,532
Yellowleg.

494
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:33,308
- Where's Turk?
- Right behind you.

495
01:19:33,308 --> 01:19:40,372
When Billy gets hold of an idea, he just won't let go of it. Especially a red-headed woman.

496
01:19:51,366 --> 01:19:56,006
Well, there's no need to keep the lady out here in the sunshine.

497
01:19:56,006 --> 01:20:00,019
Let's step inside and talk things over.

498
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:30,074
Sorry I can't offer you folks a drink.

499
01:20:30,074 --> 01:20:34,296
- What did you do with the money?
- Money? What money?

500
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:44,087
- Only one thing would bring him down here 
- keeping ahead of a posse.

501
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:47,087
I never saw folks so scared of Injuns.

502
01:20:50,766 --> 01:20:52,856
I tell you, she sure is pretty.

503
01:20:56,994 --> 01:21:00,004
Turkey, go get that money.

504
01:21:02,428 --> 01:21:06,567
- Are you crazy?
- Go on. Do what I told you to do.

505
01:21:19,358 --> 01:21:25,085
- You know, I...I just ain't got the heart to kill him.
- Huh?

506
01:21:25,085 --> 01:21:28,512
How would you like to have your gun back?

507
01:21:28,512 --> 01:21:32,567
- You want me to do it?
- I'll be much obliged.

508
01:21:42,599 --> 01:21:46,905
- Just the minute he walks back through this door.
- What about her?

509
01:21:52,339 --> 01:21:56,018
We'll decide that later. You and me.

510
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:04,336
Well, I'm going for a little walk. I'll be around.

511
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:09,311
The lady's got to admit I got guts.

512
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:26,324
You'd better get out of here.

513
01:22:26,324 --> 01:22:28,176
- You can't!

514
01:22:28,324 --> 01:22:31,176
- I've waited five years. The waiting is over. Now keep out of it.

515
01:22:32,176 --> 01:22:36,398
What happened to Mead was an accident. I know that now,

516
01:22:36,398 --> 01:22:40,620
even though I thought that I could never forgive you for it.

517
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:44,591
But I could never love a man who was a cold-blooded killer.

518
01:22:46,472 --> 01:22:48,311
Love?

519
01:22:50,276 --> 01:22:52,826
You don't even know me.

520
01:22:52,826 --> 01:22:55,585
I'm a face under a hat.

521
01:22:57,173 --> 01:23:01,186
Ever wonder why I won't take this off?

522
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:15,650
- Want to talk about love?
- I've seen you with your hat off.

523
01:23:55,486 --> 01:23:58,371
What about MY scars?

524
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:10,953
Do you know how many men I've let kiss me just because their filthy money gave them the right?

525
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:16,014
Men with dirty shirts,

526
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:20,236
smelly arms, money in their pockets.

527
01:24:23,329 --> 01:24:26,506
Can those scars be forgotten?

528
01:24:28,346 --> 01:24:30,979
Can I ask you to love a...

529
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:34,658
..a woman like that?

530
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:48,577
Now don't that make a pretty picture?

531
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:51,796
Where's Billy?

532
01:24:56,562 --> 01:24:59,404
- Out of the way.
- Don't do it!

533
01:25:58,261 --> 01:26:02,023
All this shooting and he ain't even touched him yet.

534
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:04,405
ÊíÑßí

535
01:26:06,454 --> 01:26:09,422
Billy! Are you crazy?!

536
01:26:25,557 --> 01:26:28,316
All right, Yellowleg. This is it.

537
01:26:29,319 --> 01:26:34,795
- You and me.
- Move out, Billy. Move out. I ain't got time for you.

538
01:26:34,795 --> 01:26:41,734
There ain't but two horses in this town. You know only two people are gonna ride out of here alive.

539
01:27:09,323 --> 01:27:13,294
You turned on me, Billy. And I raised him from a puppy.

540
01:27:15,844 --> 01:27:18,478
I'm not giving him this money.

541
01:27:18,478 --> 01:27:20,359
No

542
01:27:27,674 --> 01:27:31,269
Get me some slave Indians... I'll train them myself.

543
01:27:32,774 --> 01:27:35,324
Take all this money...

544
01:27:38,082 --> 01:27:42,722
Yellowleg, Yellowleg, listen to me. We can make ourselves a deal.

545
01:27:44,018 --> 01:27:49,912
I don't want that Billy with me. I want you! Look at you. I put you in that uniform.

546
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:54,385
Now come on, listen to reason.

547
01:27:54,385 --> 01:27:57,771
Why can't a Yankee join up with a Rebel?

548
01:28:00,488 --> 01:28:06,800
We could do it together. Look at all this money here. Look. I'll give it all to you.

549
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:19,299
I'll make a general out of you. General Yellowleg. 
Think of how you'd look in one of these caps...

550
01:28:46,261 --> 01:28:50,274
Listen, Yellowleg, like I told you up there...

551
01:28:50,274 --> 01:28:56,126
- You're gonna be in my army. I'll make a general out of you with gold braid.
- Remember that?

552
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:01,727
You know where you left it, don't you?

553
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:05,364
- Chickamauga.
- Look at it.

554
01:29:05,364 --> 01:29:11,425
- No... Oh, Yellowleg, listen to me, I don't want that Billy...
- Look at me!

555
01:29:12,428 --> 01:29:18,740
Yellowleg, I'll make a general out of you. 
You'll look good in that gold braid. Listen to me...

556
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:23,798
- Don't!

557
01:29:28,898 --> 01:29:31,657
Get out of here!

558
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:37,175
- Don't!

559
01:29:57,198 --> 01:29:59,121
Èíáí

560
01:30:04,847 --> 01:30:06,352
Èíáí

561
01:30:06,352 --> 01:30:10,282
You tell Yellowleg it's a fact I got soldiers!

562
01:30:52,755 --> 01:30:57,019
Hi. We're trailing a couple of bank robbers. You got one of them.

563
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:59,061
- Where's the other?

564
01:30:59,919 --> 01:31:04,961
- Inside. Looks like they figured you didn't have guts enough to come here.

565
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:08,482
 You know how people are. If it's their money...

566
01:31:08,482 --> 01:31:11,482
- the gates of hell wouldn't stop them.
- Sure.

567
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:16,122
Parson, we're going to need a few of the right kind of words from you.

568
01:31:16,122 --> 01:31:21,724
- We're burying a boy alongside of his dad.
- I'll say the right words.

569
01:31:53,367 --> 01:31:56,348
- This is a convoy.
- Yes, sir.

570
01:31:56,467 --> 01:31:59,348
 Gentlemen, you're going to make great officers in my army.

571
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:06,702
I'll soon have your uniforms for you. Gold braid. And then we'll start training...

572
01:32:06,702 --> 01:32:13,975
Thank you, sir. Well, Captain, if you'll say, "Forward, yo!" to these ranks, we'll go.

573
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:16,107
Forward, yo!

574
01:32:16,107 --> 01:32:20,329
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah

575
01:32:20,329 --> 01:32:24,509
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah... #

576
01:32:24,509 --> 01:32:26,641
Fill up those ranks!

577
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,693
Forward march! Follow me, men!

578
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:42,693
We'll get us an army, we know what to do.

579
01:32:42,693 --> 01:32:45,577
We buy some slave Indians...

580
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:46,802
# Each day when I awaken

581
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:48,027
# No more I face the empty dawn

582
01:32:48,052 --> 01:32:49,252
# For I know that my heart is not forsaken

583
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:50,477
# The dream of love that once I knew

584
01:32:50,502 --> 01:32:51,702
# Now lingers beyond the empty dawn

585
01:32:51,727 --> 01:32:52,927
# No more is my lonely heart broken... #
