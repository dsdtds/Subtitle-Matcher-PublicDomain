1
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:52,477
Hey!

2
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:09,317
- What are you doing back there?
- I was tasting the soup.

3
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,833
Well, stay away from that soup.
Do something to help me.

4
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,351
Hang these clean clothes on the line.

5
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:17,473
And keep that fire going.

6
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:54,321
- You haven't got another cup, have you?
- What for?

7
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:56,638
The tent's on fire.

8
00:04:18,483 --> 00:04:23,955
Well, our earthly possessions
are slowly getting less and less.

9
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:27,797
No place to sleep and no food.

10
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,834
What could be worse?

11
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,714
Come on.

12
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:50,602
- Where we going?
- Do I have to tell you everything?

13
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,838
- Not everything.
- if you must know,

14
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:56,671
we are going to humiliate ourselves
by begging for food.

15
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,520
What, again?

16
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:01,554
Crank the car.

17
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,161
Oh, I feel so silly,
I'll never be able to act. I can't.

18
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,195
You were wonderful.

19
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,553
I know but I never could do it
before an audience.

20
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:15,958
Oh, you could!

21
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:20,633
Play it the way you did just now and you'll be
the hit of the community play this year.

22
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,241
Now, the scene opens in the country.

23
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,513
The old lady is seated in the chair

24
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:31,282
and in comes the villain with the mortgage.

25
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:35,083
How about trying here for some food?

26
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:38,638
That's not a bad idea.
I'll see if there's any dogs.

27
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:45,833
Shh!

28
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:48,874
It's OK, there's no dogs.

29
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:50,959
Come on.

30
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,202
My, what happened?

31
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,559
Er, pardon the intrusion, lady,

32
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:24,073
but my friend and l
are victims of the Depression.

33
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:27,798
We haven't tasted food for three whole days.

34
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:31,552
Fancy not eating for three whole days.

35
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes, ma'am.
Yesterday, today and tomorrow.

36
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:39,321
We were wondering
if you would be kind enough

37
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,161
to provide us with a piece of buttered toast.

38
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,478
Oh, why, certainly.

39
00:07:44,523 --> 00:07:48,152
Would you mind throwing
a piece of ham over that?

40
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,513
Don't you worry.
I'll fix you something very nice.

41
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:55,202
A thousand thanks.

42
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:59,156
ls there some little thing we could do
to repay you for your kindness?

43
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:01,194
We're willing to work, you know.

44
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:03,916
No, I think not.

45
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:07,481
How about you chopping some wood?

46
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,354
That would be splendid.

47
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:13,236
Splendid it shall be.

48
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,513
That's fine. I'll call you when it's ready.

49
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:23,035
Why did you have to suggest cutting wood?

50
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,358
I didn't suggest it. You said to the lady...

51
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:27,633
Oh, shut up. You make me sick.

52
00:08:35,483 --> 00:08:38,475
Well, you suggested it, now you cut it.

53
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:42,162
I don't know anything about cutting wood.

54
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:46,719
Well, you ought to. You once told me
your father was in the lumber business.

55
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:49,721
I know he was
but it was only on a small way.

56
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,357
What do you mean, "small way"?

57
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,678
Well, he used to sell toothpicks.

58
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:58,191
Well, go ahead and make some toothpicks.

59
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,598
Be a chip off of the old block.

60
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:27,913
Why don't you be careful?

61
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:30,238
That thing might have hit me.

62
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:39,072
That's the finish. L...

63
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:48,681
Your meal's all ready, boys.
Come right along.

64
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:59,521
There you are.
Make yourselves right at home.

65
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:03,192
- Gee, this is nice of you.
- Don't mention it. It's all right.

66
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,393
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

67
00:10:57,243 --> 00:10:59,359
Pour the coffee.

68
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:46,998
What?

69
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,796
James Finlayson, you here again?

70
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,073
At your service.

71
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:55,001
- What do you want?
- Don't let us bandy words.

72
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:59,321
I am here to foreclose the mortgage
on your home and turn you into the street.

73
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:05,120
So, James Finlayson, you thought
to catch me unprepared and at your mercy.

74
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:08,473
But this time, you are foiled.

75
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:12,994
I am ready for this emergency.
I am going to pay you.

76
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,954
Then you can go.

77
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:19,519
Go and never darken my door again.

78
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:30,479
I've been robbed!

79
00:12:30,523 --> 00:12:33,674
Robbed! Oh!

80
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:42,033
At last, Christine De Manville,

81
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,836
I have you in my clutches!

82
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:49,675
Spare me. Spare me.

83
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:52,476
It's only a hundred dollars.

84
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:56,516
Give me just a little more time.

85
00:12:56,563 --> 00:12:58,713
Not one... Oh...

86
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:06,033
Not one more minute. And, if you're not
out of this house by three o'clock,

87
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,472
I'll have my minions throw you out.

88
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:13,199
- Bag and baggage!
- My hour has come.

89
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,234
What will I do?

90
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:26,556
- We've gotta help that old lady.
- I wish we could.

91
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:28,992
One good turn deserves another.

92
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:32,638
- So do l, neither.
- What do you mean, "So do l, neither"?

93
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:35,436
They're going to throw her into the streets.

94
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:39,192
- What can we do?
- We have got to raise a hundred dollars.

95
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,438
- A hundred dollars?
- Yes.

96
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:44,873
We couldn't even raise a thousand.
We haven't got a dime...

97
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,357
- What are we going to do?
- I have it.

98
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,598
- What?
- An idea to raise the money.

99
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:51,520
- Let's go tell her.
- No, no, no.

100
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,633
- One good turn...
- No, no, no.

101
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:57,961
We'll sneak out and not tell anyone.
We'll surprise her.

102
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:03,881
Now, don't you tell anyone
where we're going to get the money.

103
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:42,033
Now, my friends, if you'll just step over
this way a moment. Right this way, please.

104
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,233
Now, friends, listen.

105
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,036
I am here on an errand of mercy.

106
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,553
My mission here is to raise
one hundred dollars

107
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:57,235
to save a poor, grey-haired old lady
from being thrown into the streets.

108
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:03,162
My friend and I are willing to sacrifice our all

109
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:06,718
by offering this car to the highest bidder.

110
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:12,392
Just what
are you two fellas trying to do?

111
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:17,197
We're trying to sell this car
to raise one hundred dollars

112
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:20,838
to keep a poor old lady
from being thrown into the streets.

113
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:25,195
Anybody would help a poor old lady.

114
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,597
I'll give you a hundred dollars.

115
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,282
That's the spirit, folks.

116
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:40,234
I'm bid one hundred dollars.

117
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:42,035
Have you got the time?

118
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,961
One hundred dollars once!

119
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:47,597
- One hundred dollars twice!
- Eh?

120
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:49,599
The third and last call...

121
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:51,361
One twenty-five.

122
00:15:51,403 --> 00:15:54,440
Sold for 125 dollars

123
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:57,839
and I thank you for your kind attention.

124
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:03,717
Who said 125?

125
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,197
I did. I was telling him the time.

126
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:15,634
What's that?

127
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:23,713
Where d'you get it?

128
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:26,719
Now I see it all.

129
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:30,197
- What?
- "What"!

130
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:33,713
Don't try to alibi.
You stole this money from the old lady.

131
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:36,072
- Guilt is written all over you.
- What?

132
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:39,001
You'll give this money back
and make a confession.

133
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:41,841
- A confession of what?
- To think, for all these years,

134
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:45,432
I've been fostering a common thief.
A viper in my bosom.

135
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:48,395
- Whose bos... What are you saying?
- Don't bluff me.

136
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:51,480
To think you would bite the hand
that was feeding you.

137
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,912
- I didn't...
- You snake in the grass.

138
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:57,797
You traitor. You sheep in wolf's clothing.

139
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:59,834
You double-crosser.

140
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,760
You Judas!

141
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,078
- You, you...
- Stop!

142
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,353
Don't call me a "you, you".

143
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,995
Missed me, didn't you?

144
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,159
No, you don't.

145
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:14,435
Get in that car, go back and tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but...

146
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,631
Get right in this car.

147
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,074
Get in! Go on in there.

148
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,193
Tell her everything. Go on.

149
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:15,359
- What on earth's the matter?
- Madam, my one-time friend, Mr Laurel,

150
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,200
has a confession to make.

151
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,599
- I didn't do a thing...
- Confession?

152
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:26,513
Yes. He's the one who stole your money
and left you at the mercy of that villain.

153
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,633
Why, there must be some mistake.

154
00:18:28,683 --> 00:18:32,358
There's no mistake. It's all too true.

155
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,394
Why, I caught him red-handed.

156
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,877
There hasn't been any money stolen.

157
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:42,122
We were just rehearsing a play
for the community players.

158
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:54,203
I must have made a faux pas.

159
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:11,681
Please, please, don't! Please, don't, no.

160
00:19:11,723 --> 00:19:14,999
Wait, let me tell you something. I've... Oh!

161
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,354
- Come out of there.
- No, I won't.

162
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:21,361
- Come out of there.
- You'd better leave me alone.

163
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:25,078
- Come out of there, you big bozo.
- I won't do it. No.

164
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,114
- I'll make you come out.
- Oh!

165
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:29,757
Please don't! Ah!

166
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:33,040
Hey! Oh, hey, wait!

167
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,278
- Get back inside.
- Ah!

168
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,678
Let me get...

169
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,713
I'll show you.

170
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:04,152
Now wait a minute, now. Oh.

171
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,718
You missed me, didn't you?
