1
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,023
Ten hut.

2
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,486
Briggs and Hudson, fall out.

3
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,157
Sergeant Williams, take
charge.

4
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,535
The Ardona's comin' in.

5
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,662
If we don't get Horn down
to the dock for cigarettes,

6
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,415
these boys will tear down
his store.

7
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,128
Let me go, let me go!

8
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,048
I got you.

9
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,008
Lie there.

10
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:21,385
Fall dead, don't get up.

11
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,685
Hello mother, how's it by you,
today?

12
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,895
How are you this morning?

13
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:32,563
Kinda chewy this morning,
ain't we?

14
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,401
Come on, give me a lift.

15
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,652
All together now.

16
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:39,694
Heave-ho.

17
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,573
Now tell us Mama,

18
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,532
where's the old man?

19
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,575
What do you want, huh?

20
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,659
Cigarettes.

21
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:46,952
Cigarettes, no got here.

22
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:47,787
That's just it.

23
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:48,828
Where's Horn?

24
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,999
Asleep, huh?

25
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,958
Well, we'll have that bird on
his feet

26
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,919
and down to the docks,
chop-chop, pronto.

27
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,128
I think so, no.

28
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,630
I think so, yes.

29
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:58,671
Get him, boys.

30
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:00,800
What's the matter, Mama?

31
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,259
The old man acting up again?

32
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,594
How you talk?

33
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,762
What do you say?

34
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,222
My husband is a very good man.

35
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,432
What's all this?

36
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,725
What's all this?

37
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,227
Relax.

38
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:12,268
Where am I?

39
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,063
Home.

40
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:16,649
To be sure.

41
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,817
The Arduna's is in, Joe.

42
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:18,901
Well, what of it?

43
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,694
No candy corn, no sardines,

44
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:22,488
no bacon, no corned beef.

45
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,531
And no cigarettes.

46
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,033
On your feet, mate.

47
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,618
Fall in.

48
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,744
Wait, wait.

49
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,373
Much too early in the
morning for life's burdens.

50
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:33,541
Wipe your chin.

51
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:35,584
Oh well,

52
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,961
if I must, I must.

53
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,172
Have your landing cards

54
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,799
and passports ready, please.

55
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,677
Have your landing cards and
passports ready, please.

56
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,972
Let me see.

57
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,224
You want my passport, don't you?

58
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,308
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:56,146
My husband and I usually
use the same passport.

60
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,190
We have separate ones this time,

61
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,234
in case I should wish to
visit the other island

62
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,361
while he's working.

63
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,321
I wonder why it must rain.

64
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,865
Doesn't it ever stop?

65
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,741
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,411
A little more efficiency

67
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,997
and we wouldn't be kept
waiting so long.

68
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:13,914
Have your landing cards

69
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,016
and passports ready, please.

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,376
Wait just a minute.

71
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,418
There you are.

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,551
Landing cards and
passports ready, please.

73
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,889
Landing cards and passports
ready, please.

74
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,274
Thank you, just put it down
please.

75
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,317
By the way, officer.

76
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,861
I was wondering, what
does Pongo Pongo mean?

77
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,779
I don't think it means
anything at all, sir.

78
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:47,489
Then it's certainly well
named.

79
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:51,911
Unusual weather, of course.

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,580
Of course.

81
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,415
What will it be like in Apia?

82
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,541
Unusual.

83
00:07:00,961 --> 00:07:01,879
Have your landing cards

84
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,256
and passports ready, please.

85
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:09,845
Welcome to Pongo Pongo,
Mr. Davidson.

86
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,698
Thank you, but we'll only
be here for an hour or two.

87
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,641
We're taking a schooner
this afternoon to Apia.

88
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:14,910
Not this afternoon,
I'm afraid.

89
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,768
Sorry, sir.

90
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,023
Thank you.

91
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:25,819
What's the matter, Alfred?

92
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:26,946
Has anything happened?

93
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:27,821
Unwelcome news.

94
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,573
We cannot sail for
Apia this afternoon.

95
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,950
Not sail today?

96
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,117
Why?

97
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,553
One of the sailors
aboard the schooner

98
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:34,703
has come down with cholera.

99
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,747
We cannot start
until it is certain

100
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,708
that none of the rest of
the crew are effected.

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,460
It may mean a delay
of several days.

102
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,337
I think I'd prefer the cholera.

103
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,756
But where can we stay?

104
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,091
The General Store.

105
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:48,132
Hip, hip.

106
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,636
There's Mr. Horn, now.

107
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,678
Mr. Horn?

108
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:56,725
Well, upon my soul.

109
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,394
This is a treat.

110
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,853
How do you do, Mrs. Davidson?

111
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:00,896
Greetings, Mr. Horn.

112
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,690
Our poor island is honored.

113
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,109
Dr. and Mrs. MacPhaill,
Mr. Horn.

114
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,402
How do you do?

115
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,236
You're leaving soon?

116
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:08,821
No, the schooner
for Apia is delayed

117
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:09,780
on account of the cholera.

118
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,907
We shall have to ask you
to put us up.

119
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:12,950
That's tough luck,

120
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,577
for you folks, I mean.

121
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:16,662
Can nothing be done?

122
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,504
Clearly possible I can
persuade the governor

123
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,915
to make an exception
in our case,

124
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,333
I'm going to see him now.

125
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:29,425
Hey, Joe.

126
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,802
If my guests will pardon
me for a few minutes,

127
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,722
they shall have my personal
escort to the hotel.

128
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,850
What's the matter, Joe?

129
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,935
If there's anything
I hate, it's reformers.

130
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,646
Huh? So that's what's
the matter with them?

131
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,065
Yeah, you'd better
watch yourself

132
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,359
while that lovely couple
is on the island.

133
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,528
They'll break your back
to save your souls.

134
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,654
What's his badge?

135
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,824
An investigator
of Navy Conditions.

136
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,993
A professional reformer.

137
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,370
He wields more influence
in the South Seas

138
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,580
than the sun, the planets,

139
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:00,998
and the American government.

140
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,835
Pearls of wisdom.

141
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,672
Pearls of wisdom.

142
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,093
Now look here,

143
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,262
you may take the
British lion by the tail,

144
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,346
you may twist it,

145
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,347
you may jerk it,

146
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,557
you may yank it,

147
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,101
you may tie it in
a big bow knot,

148
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,227
but dash it all,

149
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,146
you can't pull it out
by the roots.

150
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,940
I say, can't you take a joke?

151
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,277
Hello lads, boys.

152
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,904
I want you to meet Thompson.

153
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,614
Sadie, meet the boys.

154
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,783
Boys.

155
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,284
And this is Mr. Horn.

156
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,704
Mr. Horn, your climate's
bummed.

157
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,538
Sorry, Sadie.

158
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,581
It's the best we got.

159
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,041
Oh, I'm not blaming you.

160
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,226
Say, what's this about the
delay?

161
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,252
How long am I booked for
this berg, do you know?

162
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:50,756
Well, I'd compose myself
for a two week stay.

163
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,509
Well,
that being the case,

164
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,986
what can't be helped can't be
helped,

165
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,803
as the saying goes.

166
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:56,970
That job in the field

167
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:57,888
will keep all right, Sadie,

168
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,990
so I shouldn't worry about it.

169
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,183
Oh, I never worry, little one.

170
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,392
Make the best of things today

171
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,894
'cause it can't be worse
tomorrow.

172
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,231
Besides, I like the boys here.

173
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,651
Hello, handsome.

174
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:12,277
When did you leave Kansas?

175
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,155
She got you that time, kid.

176
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,448
Shut up, you hyena.

177
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,243
He's very shy, Miss,
don't mind him.

178
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:22,329
Lay off sailor, or I'll
swab the deck with you.

179
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,747
Ah, don't hurt him handsome.

180
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,125
I came from Kansas once myself,

181
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,751
as fast as I could hoof it.

182
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,130
How are ya?

183
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:32,381
Fine.

184
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,674
Very pleased to meet a lady.

185
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:38,846
Better look out, Miss.

186
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:39,930
He's liable to bite.

187
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:42,933
They act like they've had
too much oats.

188
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,393
Oh, she is a one.

189
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,453
Lance, allow me to inform you

190
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,563
that Sadie is a bit of all
right.

191
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,398
Say, you'll find Sadie
some place to sleep,

192
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,399
won't you, Joe?

193
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,067
With pleasure.

194
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,320
And now shall we discuss
our sordid business matters?

195
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:56,572
Now you know how it is

196
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:57,882
when you're traveling a bit
short.

197
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:00,325
You see, Sadie left
Honolulu a bit sudden-like.

198
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,160
She's a good kid,

199
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,554
although she's down on her luck
a bit.

200
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,955
Now, she can't pay over
a dollar a day for a room

201
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,499
and you've got to take care of
her from that, will you, Joe?

202
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,144
Yeah, I was telling
the quartermaster here

203
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,379
on board myself, I've got
a burner with me

204
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,089
and besides, I don't eat so
much.

205
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,675
Oh, that'll be all right.

206
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,261
Mrs. Horn will take care of you.

207
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,346
Well, here's bubbles.

208
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,067
I hear life's terrible
back home in the States now.

209
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,109
How so?

210
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,861
Everybody being made to
behave.

211
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,114
Yes, we live in the day
of the new commandment:

212
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,825
Thou shalt not enjoy thyself.

213
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:26,453
I saw it coming 20 years ago.

214
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,996
That's why I left Chicago.

215
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,082
I wanted peace,

216
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,626
and I found it too.

217
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,381
Friend, you behold here the last
remnants

218
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:38,924
of an Earthly paradise.

219
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:42,261
That's my quarrel with
reformers,

220
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,345
they won't let it alone.

221
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,597
Yes, I can readily see how a
reformer

222
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,683
might feel a little out of place
here.

223
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,520
Sort of like a school
marm waking up in a harem.

224
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,149
You remember what we were
talking about the other night?

225
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,151
Have you told Dr. MacPhail yet?

226
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:59,903
You mean about the Mallard's
customs

227
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,030
and the moon-dancing?

228
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:02,864
Yes.

229
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,574
What did he say?

230
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,243
Well, he never says very much

231
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,620
but I'm sure he thought
it was perfectly awful.

232
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,831
Now take these islanders,
doctor.

233
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:13,667
They're naturally the
happiest, most contented

234
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,294
people on Earth.

235
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,004
They ask nothing of life

236
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,714
except to be allowed to eat,

237
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,967
and sing and dance and sleep.

238
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,969
Thinking gives them a headache.

239
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,263
The trees and the sea gives
'em all the food they want

240
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,223
so they don't have to fight.

241
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,685
They're satisfied with
the gods of wind and wave.

242
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,603
Then along comes Mr.
Davidson and tells them

243
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:36,064
they're lost souls,
they've got to be saved

244
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,333
whether they want to be or not.

245
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,526
Too bad man couldn't
develop a soul without

246
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,486
losing the Garden of Eden.

247
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,113
You're a philosopher, doctor.

248
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,823
No, I just look on.

249
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,283
Ditto, brother.

250
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,285
And I guess we both see the
joke.

251
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:56,793
And now, welcome to Villa Horn.

252
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,795
He's new here and besides,

253
00:13:58,837 --> 00:13:59,963
his eyesight's bad.

254
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,048
Yeah, I know.

255
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,467
His is bad and yours is good.

256
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,219
But mine's better and I'm taking
handsome.

257
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,740
You boys can pick up those
packages

258
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,265
and tag along in back if you
like,

259
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,683
but don't get run over.

260
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,312
That's done it.

261
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,146
The jackass said,

262
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,190
"No, not now, it's too hot,

263
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:20,609
but in the cool of the
evening, I'll be there."

264
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,197
Moses on a mountaintop,

265
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,366
so this is the sunny South Seas.

266
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:28,784
What a place.

267
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,702
Nothing but quiet and mud.

268
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,039
Farewell, pretty ones.

269
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,290
Farewell.

270
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,793
You ain't looked like that
since our first auto ride.

271
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:41,546
Take that stuff and put
it down anywhere, boys.

272
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,608
Well, I guess my idea of
me looking neat and chipper

273
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,342
when I get to Apia is shot.

274
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,219
I shouldn't worry about that,
Sadie.

275
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,013
With all this heat, you'll soon
be as dry as a blotting pad.

276
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,935
That's I should worry in Jap,
buttercup.

277
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,146
Mrs. MacPhaill,
tomorrow you and I

278
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,856
must sew the mosquito netting

279
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,775
or the nights will be
unendurable.

280
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,026
Why not sew them today?

281
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,153
I have no fancy for
being eaten up tonight.

282
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:08,865
I prefer not to do any
sewing on the Sabbath.

283
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:12,119
It would be different if
one were indecently exposed

284
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,287
by a tear in one's clothing, for
instance.

285
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,580
But under the circumstances,

286
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:18,750
it might be a very bad
example for the natives.

287
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,355
I suppose I'll find it
pretty slow down at Apia,

288
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,839
won't I, grandpa?

289
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,525
Things ought to
brighten up considerable,

290
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,550
after you get there.

291
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:29,094
Oh, Mr. Horn.

292
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,282
Say, I'd have thought
you'd been thirsty enough

293
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,558
to locate it by instinct.

294
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,392
Here, I'll look.

295
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,644
There's the shy Kentucky
refugee.

296
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:42,607
Who's got a corkscrew?

297
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,775
Here you are, Sadie.

298
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,487
Thanks, baldie.

299
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,451
Well boys, let's dip the beak.

300
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:54,995
Well, now, ain't that a
beautiful sight?

301
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,705
After you lots, delight in me
gizzard.

302
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,224
I'll find a glass
for you, Miss Thompson.

303
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,167
What for? Down the hatch.

304
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,170
Now there's a lady after me
own heart.

305
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:04,004
Friend of mine slipped me that

306
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:05,172
just before I left Honolulu.

307
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,816
"Not that you'll need it,
Sadie," said he.

308
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,467
And right he was, Sadie.

309
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,802
You're not the type to
need hooch to pep you up.

310
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,304
Ah, I was born hooched.

311
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,472
Holy moly, look at this.

312
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:15,390
The Wabash Blues.

313
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,184
Music and a nip of liquor,

314
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,853
that's what a rainy day is for,
says I.

315
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,646
Can you dance, handsome?

316
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:22,731
No, Miss Thompson.

317
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:25,233
I'm a clubfoot, I never
could twist my legs right.

318
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,110
Well, I'll learn you before I
leave,

319
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,152
that's a threat.

320
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,631
Quartermaster here is
a great little stepper.

321
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,616
You ought to see him shake a
shoulder.

322
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:36,119
For one of these brains in
here, you'd be surprised.

323
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,953
Come on, Ethelbert,

324
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:38,222
let's show these island boys how

325
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,582
hip meets hip in the
gay cafes of Honolulu.

326
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,918
Right-oh, let's have
a go at it.

327
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,628
Here, mark my cabbage.

328
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,046
Now, nothing too fancy now.

329
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,172
No.

330
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,723
Shake that thing, baby.

331
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,934
Shake that thing.

332
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:01,269
Hot mama, burn my clothes.

333
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,483
Pick them up nice
and put them down easy.

334
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,525
That's it.

335
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,111
That's the stuff, Batesy.

336
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:11,154
Now get the high five.

337
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,531
It isn't the rhythm that
counts,

338
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:13,490
it's the motion.

339
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,742
Come on now, glide.

340
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,285
Attaboy.

341
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,370
Young woman.

342
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:19,829
You got the swing now, baby.

343
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,707
Young woman, have you no
respect for the Lord's day?

344
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:23,542
What?

345
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,918
This is Sunday, young woman.

346
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,127
Were you speaking to me?

347
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:29,172
I am simply reminding you
that this is the Sabbath.

348
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,800
Sabbath? Yesterday was
Saturday, right you are.

349
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,552
I say, this must stop.

350
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:34,594
Do you hear me?

351
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:37,973
I say ma'am, are we disturbing
you?

352
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,599
Whether I am being disturbed
or not

353
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,142
is of no consequence.

354
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,537
There's six days in the week to
dance

355
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,271
if you must dance.

356
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:48,316
Mr. Horn, is this sort of
thing general in your store?

357
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,068
Well, it's a general store
ma'am.

358
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,861
Oh, enough said.

359
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,029
Complaints registered.

360
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,615
Let's go to my private suite

361
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,784
if you've no objection, Mr.
Horn.

362
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,579
No objection as far as I'm
concerned.

363
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,913
Come on, Ethelbert.

364
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,958
Come on boys, we're moving.

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,792
You bring the records, handsome.

366
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,834
And you, the hooch.

367
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,438
Drop in later if you
feel like it, Mr. Horn.

368
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:10,630
Always glad to see you.

369
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,384
Who is that young woman?

370
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,554
Her name, ma'am, is
Thompson as far as I know.

371
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,598
I mean, what is she?

372
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:21,558
I didn't inquire.

373
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,976
She was on the Arduna,
wasn't she?

374
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,936
I'm aware she was.

375
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,900
I'm afraid Mr. Davidson
will not like this at all.

376
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,341
I've argued it out with the
governor

377
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,950
but there's nothing to be done.

378
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,202
That means 10 days here.

379
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,746
Two weeks probably.

380
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:43,973
Well, I've prepared for the
worst

381
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,625
and taken rooms for us upstairs.

382
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,919
Two weeks with nothing to occupy
us.

383
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,212
Let's enforce an activity

384
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:52,589
that's likely to prove
wearisome.

385
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,431
The only thing to do is
to portion out the day

386
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,343
to different occupations.

387
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:57,594
Certain hours of the day,

388
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,262
we will set aside for study.

389
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,016
Certain hours for exercise,
rain or shine.

390
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,853
And too, certain hours
will go for recreation.

391
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,688
Recreation may be
hard to find.

392
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,082
Someone appears
to have found it.

393
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,233
It's a person from
the 2nd class,

394
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,943
exceedingly common.

395
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:16,154
Very flashily dressed.

396
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,157
In fact, she looks rather fast
to me.

397
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,826
Perhaps you noticed her on the
boat.

398
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:22,827
I met her.

399
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,746
Rather a good-natured
girl while we're waiting

400
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,830
for a position on Apia.

401
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:26,706
What kind of a girl?

402
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,375
Oh, just an ordinary human
being,

403
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,335
not over-prosperous,
I should say.

404
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,003
I think it's perfectly
outrageous

405
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,439
for her to keep that music up,
don't you?

406
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,173
If she wishes to play her own
machine,

407
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,217
it's not our right to interfere.

408
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,301
By the way, doctor,

409
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,928
we can visit the Naval hospital
tomorrow

410
00:19:39,969 --> 00:19:40,762
if you think it would
interest you.

411
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,306
It's a busman's holiday,
but I'll go.

412
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,978
The Arduna must be going
out before her scheduled time.

413
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,064
I hate to see her go.

414
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,525
She seemed to be our last link
with home.

415
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:57,195
So long-

416
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,154
You better hurry, love,

417
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,280
or you're gonna get licked.

418
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,700
Right-oh Sadie, I'm sorry
I can't stay for lunch

419
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:02,534
but I'm off.

420
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,053
But I hopes I'll see you again
sometime

421
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,995
because you're a good kid
and I likes you.

422
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:06,830
I'll tell you what you do,

423
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:09,374
you write me a nice little
loving postcard, will you?

424
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,127
Right-oh, a nice little
postcard.

425
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,044
And once you write it,

426
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,129
just drop it in the ocean.

427
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:16,423
Well, bye-bye.

428
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:17,257
Toodle-ooh.

429
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,592
- Aloha.
- Sayonara.

430
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:20,634
I'm off.

431
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,269
Goodbye, Mr. Davidson.

432
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:36,943
Goodbye, Mr. Davidson.

433
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,451
Goodbye, Mr. Davidson.

434
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,498
Hello, Mr. Davidson.

435
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,560
You better get aboard,
Quartermaster,

436
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,002
as fast as you can.

437
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:56,671
Right-oh, well,
goodbye everybody.

438
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,089
Bye-bye, folks.

439
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,439
Goodbye, Mr. Davidson.

440
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,108
Come on, the tea's
getting cold.

441
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,332
How long has this
been going on?

442
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:33,583
All morning.

443
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,977
Where did those Marines
come from?

444
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,004
They just appeared
from nowhere in her wake.

445
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,024
If we're to have a fortnight
of this sort of thing,

446
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,257
I don't know what we shall all

447
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,134
feel like at the end of it.

448
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,845
What's the matter, Alfred?

449
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,072
Of course, it just occurred
to me.

450
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,890
The woman is out of Evolay.

451
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,576
The thought occurred to
me when I first saw her

452
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,143
but I didn't dare speak of it.

453
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,603
What's Evolay?

454
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,397
The plague spot of Honolulu.

455
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:57,816
That long-haired guy in there

456
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:00,610
just gave me the filthiest look.

457
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,153
What are you going to do,
Alfred?

458
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:02,987
What do you expect me to do?

459
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:05,240
I'm not going to have this
house turned into a brothel.

460
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,074
I'm going to stop it.

461
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:07,301
She has a number of men
in there,

462
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,785
isn't it rather rash
to go in now?

463
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,287
You know Mr. Davidson
very little

464
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,832
if you think that fear
of physical danger

465
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:16,584
is going to stop him in the
performance of his duties.

466
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,088
Stop. This has gone
far enough.

467
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:23,842
- Hey!
- Boys, the skids.

468
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,847
The next time, I'll get sore.

469
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:31,140
They'll be no next time.

470
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:32,684
When you bust into a lady's
room,

471
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,103
you ought to get someone
to introduce you, fella.

472
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,981
Fall in, sweetheart.

473
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,485
Alfred.

474
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,527
Alfred.

475
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:51,160
I don't know what he'll do.

476
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:54,414
All I know is I wouldn't
be in that girl's shoes

477
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:55,748
for anything in the world.

478
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,134
Hello, there.

479
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:48,968
Hello.

480
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,094
Been out for a walk?

481
00:23:50,136 --> 00:23:54,807
About two steps, it's like
walking through hot pea soup.

482
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,976
What time of day is it?

483
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,521
Going on six, a whole hour
to put in before dinner.

484
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:01,731
Been to the hospital today?

485
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,776
No, Davidson's too busy.

486
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:07,403
Nothing left to do but twiddle
my thumbs.

487
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,197
Why twiddle?

488
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:11,157
Forced idleness
makes them restless.

489
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:15,662
Back in Illinois,
where I was raised,

490
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:17,622
it was generally believed
that a person

491
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,082
who stayed away from business

492
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:22,418
more than one working
day in every 10 years,

493
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,588
was a loose, dangerous,
and depraved character.

494
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,345
You don't see a bottle around
here anywhere, do you Doc?

495
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,222
Have a drink.

496
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,018
Not just now.

497
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,979
Well the offer still holds.

498
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,730
There's more in the store.

499
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,690
Now what was I saying?

500
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,609
The subject I believe was
the evil of too much work.

501
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,236
So it was.

502
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,279
There's a lot too much
misdirected energy

503
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:51,280
in this world, doctor.

504
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,949
Are you speaking
biographically

505
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,283
or autobiographically?

506
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:55,868
Confidentially.

507
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,162
That was a mighty foolish
thing Davidson did.

508
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,498
That girl, Sadie Thompson,

509
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,916
wasn't doing any harm.

510
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,543
Hmm, I see what you're
getting at.

511
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:05,504
He's been after me for
letting her have a room.

512
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,379
It's your own house, isn't it?

513
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:10,049
Yes, but people like that
have got a lot of influence.

514
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,051
Once they get down on a traitor,

515
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,053
he might as well set up shop
and quit.

516
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,680
Surely he isn't asking you
to turn

517
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,306
this poor girl out
into the rain.

518
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,808
No, not exactly.

519
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:21,686
He knows there'd be no place for
her to go

520
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,520
except a native hut.

521
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,231
Not but what I think she'd
do better to go to one

522
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,775
than stay here, now that he's
on to her.

523
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,086
Just what does he want you
to do?

524
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,530
Well, he said he wanted
to be fair to her and to me,

525
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,699
but he wouldn't stand for any
doings.

526
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,575
What do you think, Horn?

527
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:37,368
Is she out of Evolay,

528
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,703
that Honolulu place?

529
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,747
I don't know and I don't care.

530
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,331
What if she is?

531
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:45,543
We've all crossed thresholds
we don't brag about.

532
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,351
Hello doctor.

533
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:03,393
Evening.

534
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,481
Evening, Joe.

535
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,402
My, the merry water sprites
sure do carry on, don't they?

536
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,445
Why I-

537
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,988
- Ah, let's don't mention the
heat.

538
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,491
I just got around to
get myself dressed

539
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,242
and it's almost time to
go to bed.

540
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,554
I been playing solitaire all
afternoon,

541
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,039
trying to decide what to have
for supper.

542
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,166
Tuna fish or beans.

543
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,667
And beans won.

544
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:30,004
Then I played beans against
tamales,

545
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,089
just for something to do

546
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,840
and tamales got the set.

547
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,550
Got any canned tamales,
Mr. Horn?

548
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:35,510
I guess so.

549
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,470
Poke around until you find them.

550
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,599
Oh, no hurry.

551
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,641
Lots of time.

552
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,145
There's so much time lying
loose around this island,

553
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,706
somebody ought to bottle
it up and send it back

554
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,815
where they need some.

555
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:51,984
You don't mind, do you,

556
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:53,253
seeing we're here all by
ourselves,

557
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,363
if I sit down and have
a skag with you boys?

558
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:56,197
Not at all.

559
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,031
Have a drink.

560
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,073
Thanks.

561
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,845
You haven't seen that
Marine Sergeant around

562
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:03,371
that I call Handsome, have you?

563
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:05,790
No, he hasn't been
around today.

564
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,210
Oh, it don't matter.

565
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,920
I just want to ask him
something.

566
00:27:11,754 --> 00:27:12,547
If you do see him,

567
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:14,674
tell him to drop around
this evening, will you?

568
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:16,843
You know what I said
to you last night,

569
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:19,095
as friend to friend, get me.

570
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,681
I'd go slow on company
for a day or two.

571
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:23,516
I see,

572
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,227
until Davidson gets over his
terrible experience, huh?

573
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:29,730
Do you think I've been to
blame for what happened?

574
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:31,107
I ain't blaming anyone.

575
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,543
Pushing himself in on us
that way.

576
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,360
What harm were we doing?

577
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,028
Just talking and singing,

578
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,488
not a word or thought out
of the way

579
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,448
when bang goes the door and
in he comes,

580
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,033
knocking the phonograph over.

581
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:43,077
"Here," I says, "quit that."

582
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,370
Then he began to bawl us out.

583
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,581
Well, the boys naturally
thought he'd gone crazy

584
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:47,957
so they put the skids under him.

585
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,041
I know.

586
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,085
Anyway, I wouldn't attract
his attention anymore

587
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,628
than I had to just now.

588
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,089
Well, if it comes
to that,

589
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,008
he better not attract mine.

590
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,318
I've never known anyone like him

591
00:27:58,342 --> 00:27:59,343
and I don't want to.

592
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,100
Say, what kind of an egg is
the governor of this place,

593
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:06,934
do you know?

594
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,561
- The governor?
- Yeah.

595
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,896
Let's see,

596
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:11,606
oh, a pretty good sort I'd say.

597
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:12,647
Why?

598
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:14,859
Oh nothing.

599
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,611
I just wanted to know, that's
all.

600
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,447
The nerve of him,

601
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:21,657
going to see the governor
about me.

602
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,885
Did you ever hear
the like of it?

603
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,511
How do you know he went
to see him about you?

604
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:25,953
O'Hara told me.

605
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,414
He's reported O'Hara to
his officer for drinking.

606
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,500
I don't want that boy to
get any trouble through me.

607
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:34,128
Oh, I guess O'Hara can
take care of hisself.

608
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,464
Yeah, well so can I if it
comes to that.

609
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:37,965
Miss Thompson, I'd be careful.

610
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:38,799
Of what?

611
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,927
I'd be careful for my own
good.

612
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:42,220
You can't tell.

613
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,306
Give me strength.

614
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,575
How many times have
I got to tell you

615
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,768
that old sin-buster
don't mean a thing to me?

616
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:50,811
If he minds his own
business, I'll mind mine.

617
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:52,271
And if he's looking for trouble,

618
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,565
I'll see that he gets it,
that's all.

619
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,734
Mr. Davidson's opinion
of people

620
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,528
- is never wrong.
- Oh, really?

621
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,199
Me thinks I hear
the winds of reform

622
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,617
whistling down the chimney.

623
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:08,621
Swear after low hussy frolics
off to buy her supper.

624
00:29:11,707 --> 00:29:13,477
Where do you keep your
canned tamales, old partner?

625
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,293
If there's any left,

626
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,420
you'll find them on
that shelf by the door.

627
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,429
Anyway, there's no ill
feeling between any of us,

628
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:27,014
- is there?
- Huh?

629
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,809
Well, I wouldn't say the
doc has been exactly chatty.

630
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,982
Life just teems with quiet fun.

631
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,529
Has Mr. Davidson returned yet?

632
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,863
Not yet, Mrs. Davidson.

633
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,007
How's the headache, any better?

634
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:45,449
Very little.

635
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,544
That girl, Miss Thompson.

636
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:58,921
I have an idea she's
sorry for what happened.

637
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:01,882
If she knew what
she'd really done,

638
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:03,551
she'd be sorrier still.

639
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,471
Mr. Davidson has a wonderful
heart

640
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:09,974
and no one has ever gone
to him in trouble

641
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,101
without being comforted,

642
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,395
but he has no mercy for sin.

643
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,439
Did you find your tamales,
Sadie?

644
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,024
Yeah.

645
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:20,067
Don't look around,
here she comes now.

646
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:22,611
Yes, here I come now.

647
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:24,113
Why shouldn't I come now?

648
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,740
See here, let's settle this.

649
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:27,050
I'm paying for my own room here,

650
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:28,200
isn't that so, Mr. Horn?

651
00:30:28,242 --> 00:30:29,368
That's so, Miss Thompson.

652
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,470
Will you kindly tell
your guests then

653
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:32,496
that I have just as much
right here as they have?

654
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:35,458
Now, Miss Thompson, there
isn't anyone saying you haven't.

655
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:36,709
Don't look at her.

656
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,835
Don't speak to her.

657
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,798
No, I wouldn't if I was you.

658
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:53,351
She's brazen, outrageous.

659
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,519
Don't, you'll only harm
yourself.

660
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,147
Oh, it's foolish, I know,

661
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,400
but it's the first time
I've ever had words

662
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,361
with a woman of that sort.

663
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,405
Well, there's one comfort.

664
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,658
We shan't have to suffer this
sort of thing much longer.

665
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:13,037
Mr. Davidson is
attending to that.

666
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:19,709
Hello, Davidson.

667
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,422
Alfred, please change
your wet clothes.

668
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,341
No, I shall be going
out again, probably.

669
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,467
Again?

670
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,387
Oh, Alfred, you must try
to get a little rest.

671
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:30,763
Alfred, you must.

672
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,598
My wife like Martha,

673
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,475
thou has troubled
thyself about many things

674
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,560
but mostly about me.

675
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,038
I do not know what I should ever
have done

676
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,688
without my dear wife.

677
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,440
Merely days of our island work,

678
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,234
it was she who gave me
the strength

679
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,318
and courage to go on.

680
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:47,863
Alfred,

681
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,450
just before you got back,
that girl spoke to me.

682
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,869
She jeered and screamed at us.

683
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,038
What are you going to do
about it?

684
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,432
Dinner ready.

685
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,417
Strange how one's thoughts
run to food

686
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,085
when there's nothing else
to think of.

687
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,629
As it happens, there is
a great deal to think of.

688
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,506
This Thompson woman,
you say, spoke to you?

689
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,842
Yes, she thrust herself in
upon us

690
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:08,884
with low insults.

691
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:10,553
Hmm, the governor tells me

692
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:12,930
that the affair is no concern of
his,

693
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,598
but if I find her incorrigible,

694
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,851
I shall see to it that he acts.

695
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:18,310
I'm afraid he has no backbone.

696
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:20,354
I suppose that means he won't
do exactly

697
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,440
as you want, whatever it
is you want him to do.

698
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:24,108
I only want him to do
what is right.

699
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,902
There may be differences of
opinion as to what is right.

700
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:28,821
If a man had
a gangrenous foot,

701
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,239
would you have patience
with anyone

702
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,740
who hesitates to cut it off?

703
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,742
Gangrene is a matter of fact.

704
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,035
And is not evil?

705
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:37,246
To me, it's always
seemed a matter of opinion.

706
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,914
Anyway, the poor thing
will only be here

707
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,541
until the boat for Apia goes.

708
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,685
And after she gets to Apia?

709
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,627
I can't see how that
concerns us.

710
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,063
Well, that's where
you and I differ doctor.

711
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,548
I think it'll be best if I spoke
to her.

712
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,758
But Alfred, why do you
see her?

713
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,303
I cannot act until I have
given her every chance.

714
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:53,971
She'll only insult you.

715
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:54,805
Let her insult me.

716
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,764
Let her spit on me.

717
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:57,725
She has an immortal soul

718
00:32:57,766 --> 00:33:00,311
and I must do all in my power
to save it.

719
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,699
Miss Thompson,
I want to talk to you.

720
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,242
I'm eating my supper.

721
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,827
I'll wait until you're
through.

722
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,164
Oh, I guess the supper can
stand by if it's important.

723
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,308
Miss Thompson, I have
come to make you a gift,

724
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,936
the most precious gift
that life can offer.

725
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,439
You want to give me something?

726
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,982
Yes, I want to give you
something.

727
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,485
I guess I'm not following.

728
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,861
The gift I offer is free.

729
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:56,659
I don't know why I get

730
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,661
all this attention from you,
Mr. Davidson.

731
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,539
I guess you mean well.

732
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,124
I think I can worry along

733
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:07,127
as I've been worrying along
for these several years.

734
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:09,880
I've gone my own way and
don't ask any favors.

735
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,775
Those who have the key
of salvation offered them

736
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,217
and failed to open the door

737
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,510
must be destroyed.

738
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,720
Oh, I see what you mean

739
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:19,098
but I won't get destroyed.

740
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,975
I always make out one way
or another.

741
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,121
If that's all, Mr. Davidson,

742
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,272
I'll go on eating.

743
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:27,439
I'm hungry.

744
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:29,084
You're hungry for the
bread of the spirit.

745
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,194
You're thirsty for the
waters of eternal life.

746
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,030
- You mean right by me, Mr.
- Davidson,

747
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,490
and I'm grateful,

748
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,285
especially after what
happened the other day.

749
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:42,413
You know, just between
ourselves,

750
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,724
I had a feeling you were laying
to get me

751
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,292
for that little trouble we had.

752
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,377
I felt awful bad about it

753
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,379
and I've been wanting to
apologize.

754
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,380
I see you are mistaking me

755
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,632
but I do not think willfully.

756
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,218
They all said you were sore
but,

757
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,696
well, I didn't think a man
as big as you

758
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,531
could hold a grudge over
a little misunderstanding.

759
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,640
This is all beside the
point, Miss Thompson.

760
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,642
The thing that concerns me now

761
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,936
is that you be given
your chance before I act.

762
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,480
My chance for what?

763
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:09,982
Your chance to be saved.

764
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,529
Oh, I'm all right.

765
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,574
Don't you worry about me a bit.

766
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,911
You see, I'm a happy go
lucky sort of a fella.

767
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:24,455
It's true, I'm broke now

768
00:35:24,496 --> 00:35:25,914
but that don't worry me.

769
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,601
I'll be all right as
soon as I get to Apia.

770
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,668
I've got friends there.

771
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,587
Yes, what sort of friends?

772
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:33,713
Just friends.

773
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,634
Girl I used to work with is
there

774
00:35:36,675 --> 00:35:39,637
and some American boys have
opened up a sugar plant.

775
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:41,358
She wrote me I could
have a job as cashier.

776
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm pretty quick at figures.

777
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:45,351
For some time, you've lived
in Honolulu, haven't you?

778
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:47,519
What did you do there?

779
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:48,354
I had a job.

780
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:49,563
What kind of a job?

781
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,067
Well, part of the time

782
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:54,485
I had sort of a singing job.

783
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:57,738
My voice ain't so bad if
you don't listen too hard.

784
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,198
Before you went away to
Honolulu,

785
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,239
where were you?

786
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:02,135
Where did I come from, do you
mean?

787
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,370
Yes, where did you come from?

788
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:06,830
Well, I was born in Kennishaw,
Kansas

789
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:07,998
if that means anything.

790
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:11,001
Ma and Pa got the California
fever so they

791
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,312
sold the farm and bought a ranch

792
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,463
just outside of Los Angeles.

793
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,757
I was about 15 then, I guess.

794
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,677
Then Ma died and Pa and I
didn't get along so well

795
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:21,970
so I went up to San Francisco.

796
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:24,056
I worked there up until the
time I went to Honolulu.

797
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,891
What made you go away to
Honolulu?

798
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,977
Oh, I don't know.

799
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,121
I wanted a change, I suppose.

800
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:31,063
Oh, you wanted a change?

801
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:31,980
Well, Sadie Thompson,

802
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,357
this gift I have to offer you,

803
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,983
what are you going
to do about it?

804
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,193
Do about it?

805
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,195
I don't know.

806
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:45,994
I don't know what
you're talking about.

807
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,666
See here, I told you I wasn't
asking anything from anybody.

808
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,543
I can take care of myself.

809
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,086
Up or down, in jack or broke,

810
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,546
what's the odds?

811
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:56,606
Wherever night ever takes me,

812
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,798
that's my resting place.

813
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,841
That's my way.

814
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:04,346
Thank you, though,
for your interest.

815
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,932
It's kind of you after what
happened.

816
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,702
I'm mighty glad you
aren't sore at me 'cause,

817
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,561
well, I like to keep
friends with everybody.

818
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:15,232
Miss Thompson, I see I
must be patient with you.

819
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,317
I see I must try and make you
understand,

820
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,278
my poor lost child.

821
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:22,072
What happened the other
day is of no importance.

822
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,031
Do you imagine what you

823
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:25,534
or those sailors said to
me makes any difference?

824
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,788
You sure are all to
the good, Mr. Davidson.

825
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,498
But, I want to say this,

826
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,001
don't be afraid but that
I'll keep to myself.

827
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:36,211
I know oil and water don't mix.

828
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:37,814
Those ladies in your party
won't even know

829
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,423
I'm under the same roof as them.

830
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,716
I'll be as quiet as a mouse,

831
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,759
honest I will.

832
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,718
Besides,

833
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,072
I don't want to get anymore
black looks from them.

834
00:37:46,096 --> 00:37:47,848
Oh no, you will get no more
black looks

835
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,849
from them, my poor child.

836
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,517
They're only waiting
for the moment

837
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,477
when they can be your friends,

838
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,604
to help you with your burden.

839
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:57,191
Oh no, you don't know
the ladies like I know 'em.

840
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,568
You don't need a spyglass to see

841
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,695
those ladies and me'll never be
shipmates.

842
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,491
This is your chance, Sadie
Thompson,

843
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,201
if you will accept your
atonement

844
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,660
without resentment or grief,

845
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,412
the way will be found for you.

846
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:14,625
I'll admit you've got me
stalled.

847
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,210
What are you driving at?

848
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:17,251
What have I to atone for?

849
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,421
Your life.

850
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:24,760
Mr. Davidson, why do you worry
about me?

851
00:38:25,677 --> 00:38:27,304
You have had your own soul
entrust

852
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,555
and you have failed.

853
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,141
It is my business to show
you the way to redeem it.

854
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:34,162
Haven't I anything to
say about myself then?

855
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,522
You can choose but one of two
paths.

856
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,192
What's the second choice?

857
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,193
Destruction.

858
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,324
And who's gonna destruct me?

859
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,244
The powers which find no place
for evil.

860
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,246
And you, what are you going to
do?

861
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:53,330
Only my duty.

862
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:55,916
Yeah, I know.

863
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,644
You went to see the governor
about me, didn't you?

864
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,544
You're right, Miss Thompson,

865
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:00,295
I have been to see the governor.

866
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,213
So all you said just now

867
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,840
about letting bygones be
bygones,

868
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:04,383
calling quits on that bust-up
we had

869
00:39:04,424 --> 00:39:05,926
- was just a bluff, huh?
- Be silent.

870
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:06,927
Are you ready to put away
your sins,

871
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,720
to live a righteous and decent
life,

872
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:09,638
to pray for forgiveness?

873
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,199
If you are not, be it
on your own head.

874
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,015
Hey, hey.

875
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:13,701
I shall not let you go
to a Apia, Sadie Thompson.

876
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:14,476
You are an evil woman,

877
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,310
you have lived an evil life

878
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,622
and you have come here to carry
your infamy to other places.

879
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,897
You're a liar.

880
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,940
Who do you think you are,

881
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,567
standing there and calling me
names?

882
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,902
Do you deny that you
have escaped from Evolay?

883
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,922
I've listened to you all
I'm gonna listen to you.

884
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,155
Now, you listen to me.

885
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,824
You just told me I've got
to be careful.

886
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,784
Well you'd better be careful
yourself.

887
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,845
Lay off me, or I'll show you
what it means

888
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,370
when I start to get mad.

889
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,289
It'll be worse for you
if you don't.

890
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,627
The devil in you is strong,

891
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,296
my poor Sadie Thompson.

892
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:43,255
Evil has claimed you as its own.

893
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,007
You take care of your own evil

894
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,550
and I'll take care of mine.

895
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,551
I know what you want.

896
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,844
You want another scout.

897
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,262
Well, you don't get mine.

898
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,930
You don't fool me.

899
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,199
You want to make me over
your way, do you?

900
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,057
Well, you just try it.

901
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,059
This is your last
chance, Sadie Thompson.

902
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:57,227
Kneel with me and pray.

903
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,979
Let go of me.

904
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,248
Sadie Thompson,
you are doomed.

905
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,940
Ah, you make me laugh.

906
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,123
Evening.

907
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,960
Young man, I should not
come here if I were you.

908
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:22,794
Why?

909
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:24,588
You're likely to get into more
trouble

910
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,465
than you're in already.

911
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:28,508
This isn't my first year
away from home, ma'am,

912
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,218
and I ain't been run over yet.

913
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,012
Do you know what kind
of a girl

914
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,306
this Sadie Thompson is?

915
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,432
Yes, ma'am.

916
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:39,895
My advice to you is to
keep away from bad company.

917
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,106
Bad company present.

918
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,904
You'll excuse us, won't you?

919
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,990
Mr. Horn.

920
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:08,340
What's the matter?

921
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,967
You look low.

922
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,426
Low?

923
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:12,468
Maybe.

924
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,347
It's this rain, I guess.

925
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:19,017
Makes me jumpy.

926
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:23,480
Makes me want to knock
my head against the wall.

927
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,666
It's worse when it don't rain,

928
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,959
when the sun comes out for a
minute

929
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,193
you think you're in a steam
room.

930
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,320
You ought to try getting out
for a walk.

931
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,613
I was out this morning.

932
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:36,284
I went to see that Half caste
family you told me about.

933
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,305
They slammed the door
in my face so fast

934
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,164
you'd have thought
I had smallpox.

935
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,293
Being an orphan's
a wonderful thing.

936
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,962
Sadie, please.

937
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,272
Do you want to get me
out of a jam?

938
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:49,756
Okay, Joe.

939
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,383
Thank you, Sadie.

940
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,936
Listen to it.

941
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,147
Don't it make you want
to scream?

942
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:07,858
When you do scream,

943
00:42:07,899 --> 00:42:10,318
what good does it do ya?

944
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,487
You haven't any strength left.

945
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,031
You're hopeless,

946
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:15,323
miserable.

947
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,159
Don't talk like that,
Miss Sadie.

948
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,410
Don't sound like you.

949
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,452
Ah, forget it.

950
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,205
I've got the fantas, I guess.

951
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,165
I'll get over them.

952
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,880
You see, I just had a
run-in with that Davidson.

953
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:30,714
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

954
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,840
What about?

955
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,010
He's not gonna let me
go to Apia, so he says.

956
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,553
And anyone can see
with two glass eyes

957
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,971
that this side of the equator,

958
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,806
he's in right and I'm in wrong.

959
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,536
The only thing
I can't figure out

960
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,938
is what devil's trick
he'll use to stop me.

961
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,207
I don't see what he could do.

962
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,232
Yeah, neither do I,

963
00:42:49,274 --> 00:42:50,901
but we don't set with bells,

964
00:42:50,942 --> 00:42:52,027
either of us.

965
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,922
You know, there's something
about that old crow

966
00:42:54,946 --> 00:42:55,946
that isn't human.

967
00:42:56,948 --> 00:42:58,825
He's deep, creepy.

968
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,661
I guess it's his eyes.

969
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:03,890
They seem to look right into you

970
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,582
and know what you're thinking.

971
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:14,091
Something tells me I'm gonna
need friends soon, handsome.

972
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:15,132
Far from home.

973
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,427
You just keep your chin up,

974
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,469
it'll be all right.

975
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,181
Yeah, but it's not
knowing what's going on.

976
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,849
Being here alone,

977
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,645
in this rain.

978
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,315
I feel about so big,

979
00:43:31,274 --> 00:43:33,235
like a kid feels in a bad dream.

980
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:35,237
Things coming at ya,

981
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:38,031
you yelling for help but nobody
hears you.

982
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,491
Well, anytime you call
for help,

983
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,827
I'm right here,
don't forget that.

984
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:43,161
Thanks, handsome.

985
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,414
Say, looka here, if
something should go wrong,

986
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,917
that is, about you
getting to Apia,

987
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,252
what'll you do?

988
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:52,212
You might as well make plans.

989
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,254
What'll I do?

990
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,775
You mean, you're afraid
something will go wrong?

991
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,551
No, no, but if that old
nose-pusher

992
00:43:57,592 --> 00:43:59,302
gets around the governor
somehow

993
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:00,762
and they do stop you somehow,

994
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,055
what'll you do?

995
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,392
I don't know.

996
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,018
Go back to the States,
I suppose?

997
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,645
No.

998
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,331
There's no way they could
make me go back, is there?

999
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,983
I don't see how,
unless you want to.

1000
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:17,237
Well, I don't want to go
back to the States yet a while.

1001
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,448
Mightn't be bad to run
back and see your folks.

1002
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,325
I haven't any folks.

1003
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,330
Going back to the States
doesn't mean anything to me.

1004
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:28,582
It don't to me either.

1005
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,378
Why, what's the matter,
Miss Sadie?

1006
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,546
I won't go back.

1007
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,590
They can't make me, can they?

1008
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:38,234
You don't want to go to
Honolulu either, I suppose?

1009
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,258
No.

1010
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,469
You could go to Sydney.

1011
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,306
Australia?

1012
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:45,432
What'd I do there?

1013
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:46,641
Work's easy to get.

1014
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,476
Living's cheap, they say.

1015
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:52,189
I'd head that way instead
of a Apia, if I were you.

1016
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,457
You think I'd do better there?

1017
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:55,483
You'd never get much
of anywhere in a Apia.

1018
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:57,319
Grease-spot of the world,
they say,

1019
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,362
and hot holy bilge water.

1020
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,908
I never thought of Sydney.

1021
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:03,783
Can I get there from here?

1022
00:45:03,825 --> 00:45:05,535
There's a boat twice a month.

1023
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,369
I'm headed that way

1024
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:07,805
just as soon as I shed these
hash marks.

1025
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:08,663
Yeah?

1026
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,016
That'll be a month
and three days.

1027
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,309
What are you going
to do there, handsome?

1028
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,292
Going in the building
business.

1029
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:15,587
An old shipmate of mine has
a place and wants a partner.

1030
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,981
These three years Lefty's
been after me

1031
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,049
to get a discharge and come in
with him.

1032
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,217
You'd like Lefty.

1033
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:21,468
Me and him joined the service,

1034
00:45:21,509 --> 00:45:22,802
same time 12 years ago.

1035
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,223
Oh, I'm glad you're fixed,
handsome.

1036
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:27,557
You ought to do fine.

1037
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,393
You know, two times
Lefty and me joined up.

1038
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:31,811
When it comes to number three,

1039
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:33,021
"Nix," says he.

1040
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,106
"Guess what I'm going to do?"
says Lefty.

1041
00:45:35,148 --> 00:45:36,816
Well, I knew without guessing

1042
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:38,777
so I stood up with him
and the bride

1043
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:40,445
and they shoved off to Sydney,

1044
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,988
me throwing the rice.

1045
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,449
I'll bet
you'll be glad to see him.

1046
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,951
If you should go to Sydney,

1047
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:49,162
Lefty and Maggie will
put you wise what to do.

1048
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,289
Yeah, can't I just hear
Lefty's wife

1049
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,209
yelping with joy at the sight
of me.

1050
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,294
You haven't any cause
to worry about Maggie.

1051
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,380
You two would get along swell.

1052
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,882
Baby boy, I know females,

1053
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,467
you don't.

1054
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,177
I got an idea what's
on your mind

1055
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,113
but Maggie ain't the kind
of a dame you're meaning.

1056
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,139
She's square from the toes up.

1057
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:10,016
Funny thing, them that kick
highest

1058
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,768
always seem to settle down
hardest.

1059
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,190
You mean this Maggie was sort
of gay

1060
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,650
before Lefty came along?

1061
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,568
Lefty met her in Honolulu.

1062
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,879
They were both nuts over
each other

1063
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:23,238
right from the start.

1064
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,072
It never mattered
to either of them

1065
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,490
that they met in Evolay.

1066
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,452
In Evolay?

1067
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:30,412
Yeah.

1068
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:31,555
Knowing the worst to begin with

1069
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:33,373
isn't always the worst way
to begin.

1070
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,418
Of course,
if there's some reason

1071
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:38,545
why you're set for a Apia,

1072
00:46:38,586 --> 00:46:41,840
if there's someone you're
wanting to see there,

1073
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:44,342
I wouldn't want to persuade you.

1074
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,469
I'm not
looking forward to a Apia

1075
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,013
with any wild joy.

1076
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:49,306
Then there's another thing.

1077
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:51,182
If you go to Sydney now,

1078
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:53,685
I'll be hovering in sight
in a few weeks.

1079
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,146
Not that that might mean
so much to you maybe.

1080
00:46:58,189 --> 00:46:59,816
I haven't so many friends,
handsome,

1081
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,693
but what I could do
with one more.

1082
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:09,701
You know, you're an awful
funny fella, handsome.

1083
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,870
I guess I'm the
dumbbell king, all right.

1084
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,127
Have they any kids?

1085
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,503
Who?

1086
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:22,672
Those friends of yours in
Sydney.

1087
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,300
Oh, I was thinking
of something else.

1088
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,426
Yep, two.

1089
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,510
How about it?

1090
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,306
Huh? How about what?

1091
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,059
Changing your route and
going to Sydney instead.

1092
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,602
Sure, why not?

1093
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:38,396
I guess no one can stop
me from doing that.

1094
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,230
What a simp I was,

1095
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:42,108
getting my wind up all over
nothing.

1096
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,610
Here I was jumping with the
shakes

1097
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:44,527
and nervous as a witch

1098
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:47,197
'cause that dismal crumb
wouldn't let me go to Apia.

1099
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:48,698
Well, Apia my foot.

1100
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,116
It's Sydney for mine.

1101
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,456
It's for you.

1102
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,290
For me?

1103
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:01,836
Who's writing me a letter?

1104
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,215
It's from the governor's office.

1105
00:48:05,256 --> 00:48:07,258
You better open it.

1106
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,149
What's the matter?

1107
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,317
I won't go back.

1108
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,194
They can't make me, there's
reasons.

1109
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,445
I got some rights, haven't I?

1110
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,655
What's the matter?

1111
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:30,824
The governor's ordered
me back to San Francisco.

1112
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:32,075
Now, don't get nervous.

1113
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,451
I'll tell you what you do.

1114
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,411
You go and see the governor.

1115
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:35,679
Ask him as a favor
to let you stay here

1116
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:36,806
until the Sydney boat leaves.

1117
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,182
That'll only be three
or four more days.

1118
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,040
Will he see me?

1119
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:39,874
Hurry up before he goes
to supper.

1120
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:40,708
It's only a few steps.

1121
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,584
Do you want me to go with you?

1122
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:42,419
Yeah, will you?

1123
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,546
Wait'll I'll get my coat
and I'll make him listen.

1124
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:59,310
So, you're back, are ya?

1125
00:48:59,352 --> 00:49:01,438
You low-down skunk.

1126
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:03,290
What have you been telling
the governor about me?

1127
00:49:03,314 --> 00:49:04,750
I've been hoping to have
another talk

1128
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:05,567
with you, Miss Thompson.

1129
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:07,777
Why, you miserable
snail-snatcher.

1130
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,879
I wouldn't talk to you
if you and me

1131
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:10,905
were the only two people
left on Earth.

1132
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,824
Why, you're so doggone
mean it makes me sick

1133
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:13,950
even to look at you.

1134
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,285
That's what I think of you.

1135
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:16,578
Coming to me with all that guff

1136
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,121
you spilled about salvation,

1137
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,081
then going and having me
deported on top of it.

1138
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,308
- Why, you low lizard.
- Sadie.

1139
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:22,292
I'm wholly indifferent to the
abuse

1140
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,918
you think fit to heap upon me.

1141
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,504
Filling the governor with
a lot of filthy lies about me

1142
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:29,466
and now this comes so I got
to beat it on the next boat.

1143
00:49:29,507 --> 00:49:30,901
I hardly expect him
to let you stay

1144
00:49:30,925 --> 00:49:31,843
under the circumstances.

1145
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,070
Yeah, well, what did the
governor know

1146
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:34,280
or care about me until you went
and hauled

1147
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,430
your hooks into me?

1148
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,973
It's you that did it,
you did it all!

1149
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,617
I don't want to deceive
you, Miss Thompson.

1150
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:39,743
I urged the governor to take

1151
00:49:39,767 --> 00:49:41,978
the only steps consistent
with his obligation.

1152
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,396
Well, why couldn't you
let me be?

1153
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,481
Was I doing you any harm?

1154
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:45,875
You may rest assured
if you had been,

1155
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,484
I'd be the last one
to resent it.

1156
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,170
You don't think I want to
stay in this rain hole, do you?

1157
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,738
You're being given every
opportunity of getting out.

1158
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:53,048
Come on Sadie, don't say
anymore.

1159
00:49:53,072 --> 00:49:54,949
You, I know your kind.

1160
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,701
You dirty two-faced mutt.

1161
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,619
I bet when you were a kid,

1162
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,787
you caught flies and tore
their wings off.

1163
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,831
I bet you stuck pins in
frogs just to see them

1164
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,642
wiggle and flap while
you run them electrical.

1165
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:04,834
I know you.

1166
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,604
Why, you'd tear the heart
out of your grandmother

1167
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:07,587
if she didn't think your way

1168
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,297
and tell her you were saving
her soul,

1169
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,840
you Psalm-singing son of a...

1170
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:14,260
You will be glad to hear

1171
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,262
that the governor
has acted at last.

1172
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,722
He's a weak man.

1173
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,057
For days, he has shilly-shallied

1174
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:21,142
saying it was none of his
concern.

1175
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,144
I can readily see why.

1176
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,437
How did you convince him?

1177
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:28,191
I finally had to speak
straight to his shoulder.

1178
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,994
The foundation that I
represent in Washington

1179
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,196
is not entirely without
influence.

1180
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,740
Miss Thompson will sail on
the next boat that goes.

1181
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,950
How soon will that be?

1182
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:40,203
The Golden Gate is due here
from Sydney next Tuesday.

1183
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,329
She will sail on that.

1184
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,706
Four days more.

1185
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Are you ready?

1186
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:56,094
Well, that settles Sadie
Thompson's hash, I guess.

1187
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,564
Mrs. Davidson told me that
she hasn't closed her eyes

1188
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:08,982
ever since that girl came

1189
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:10,567
to live under the same roof
as her.

1190
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:13,945
The founder of her
religion wasn't so squeamish.

1191
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,155
Don't joke about such
things, please, Robert.

1192
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:19,284
Excuse me Doc, Miss
Thompson isn't feeling well.

1193
00:51:19,325 --> 00:51:20,577
Will you see her for a moment?

1194
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:21,619
Certainly.

1195
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,665
She's right out here.

1196
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,427
Sorry you're not feeling well.

1197
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:40,054
I'm well enough,
not really sick.

1198
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,223
O'Hara said that just
"cause I had to see you.

1199
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,391
Yes, Miss Thompson.

1200
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,768
I gotta get back
for inspection now.

1201
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,228
I'll see you later.

1202
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,313
Keep your chin up.

1203
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:49,354
Thanks, handsome.

1204
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:55,403
Lucky meeting, Sarge.

1205
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,237
What's up?

1206
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,448
Hey, what have you been
doing lately?

1207
00:51:58,489 --> 00:51:59,741
You're booked for the brig.

1208
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:01,034
That's right, Sarge.

1209
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:02,285
Fall in.

1210
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,327
Okay.

1211
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,998
I don't know exactly
what I can do.

1212
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,100
I thought maybe you
wouldn't mind

1213
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,585
asking him if he'd let me
wait and go to Sydney instead.

1214
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,712
It's only three or four days
longer.

1215
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,546
I'll ask him.

1216
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,840
Tell him I can get work
in Sydney, straight stuff.

1217
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,776
Tell him I just can't go
back to San Francisco now,

1218
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,010
there's reasons.

1219
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,052
Will you, please?

1220
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:22,221
I'll do what I can.

1221
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:23,973
Thank you, thank you.

1222
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:27,935
- Oh, Davidson?
- What is it, Doctor?

1223
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,687
I want to speak to you
about something,

1224
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,813
shall I come up?

1225
00:52:30,855 --> 00:52:34,567
- No, I'll come right down.
- Tell him I ask his pardon.

1226
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,401
Tell him I'm sorry.

1227
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,445
Better get into your
room now, Miss Thompson.

1228
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,452
Well Doctor, what can I do
for you?

1229
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,538
It's about Miss Thompson.

1230
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,957
The governor has told her
that if you have no objection,

1231
00:52:49,999 --> 00:52:51,268
he will allow her to remain here

1232
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:52,877
until she can take the boat for
Sydney.

1233
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,961
I'm sorry, Doctor,

1234
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:55,838
but it is useless to discuss
the matter.

1235
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,800
It appears the girl has
reasons for not wanting

1236
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,592
to return to San Francisco.

1237
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,219
I don't see that it makes any
difference

1238
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,970
if she goes to Sydney instead.

1239
00:53:03,012 --> 00:53:04,156
It's only a matter
of a few days.

1240
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,265
Well, you mean this
interference for the best

1241
00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:08,309
but my mind is made up.

1242
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,578
You want to know what I think?

1243
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:11,646
I think you're harsh and
tyrannical.

1244
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,649
I'm terribly sorry you should
think that of me, Doctor.

1245
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,942
Believe me, my heart bleeds

1246
00:53:15,983 --> 00:53:18,194
for that unfortunate young woman

1247
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,614
I cannot find in my conscience
to change my decision.

1248
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,216
However, if the governor wishes
to do so

1249
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,201
on his own account, that is his
business.

1250
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,243
He won't,

1251
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:29,038
and you know why.

1252
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,474
Please don't bare any malice
toward me

1253
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,959
because I cannot exceed
to your wish.

1254
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,378
I respect you very much, Dr.
MacPhail

1255
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,522
and I should be sorry indeed

1256
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,463
if you thought ill of me.

1257
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,340
I have no doubt you have a
sufficiently

1258
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,510
good opinion of yourself to
bear mine with equanimity.

1259
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,567
I'm sorry.

1260
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,449
Don't give up hope, Miss
Thompson.

1261
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,576
I think it's a shame the
way they're treating you.

1262
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,494
I'll go and see the governor
myself.

1263
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,746
Will you?

1264
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:13,166
Will you now?

1265
00:54:13,207 --> 00:54:15,042
- Now.
- Oh, you're awful good,

1266
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:16,084
awful good.

1267
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,338
You don't know what this
means to me, Doctor.

1268
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,173
Don't cry, Miss Thompson.

1269
00:54:20,214 --> 00:54:21,299
I think I can do something.

1270
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,550
God bless you.

1271
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,234
Dear to the lord.

1272
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:56,876
Me tell you something.

1273
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,005
Mr. Davidson.

1274
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,548
What's that?

1275
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,175
What are you saying?

1276
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:09,222
All the same I know.

1277
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,774
What's she saying?

1278
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,401
What were you saying, Ameena?

1279
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:26,405
All the same I know.

1280
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:27,240
A witch doctor.

1281
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:30,243
A species of wizards of the sea.

1282
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:32,954
Knew everything, saw everything.

1283
00:55:32,995 --> 00:55:34,497
Lived by the power of God.

1284
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,876
A real goat charmer had no
charms for him.

1285
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,295
When hungry, he simply
ferreted out a devil

1286
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,213
and ate him up for tea.

1287
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,090
Ah, cut it.

1288
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:46,300
That kind of talk gives me
the willies.

1289
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:52,473
Let me have a drink,
will ya, Joe?

1290
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,896
That's Davidson up there,
isn't it?

1291
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,314
Sounds like his voice.

1292
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,482
What's he saying?

1293
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:04,151
He's saying, "Amen."

1294
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:15,121
Either that stuff's jinxed
or I am, Horn.

1295
00:56:15,162 --> 00:56:17,164
I can't seem to feel it.

1296
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,625
Maybe the Atua is after me.

1297
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,754
What's that the old jig does?

1298
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,300
Sees everything, knows
everything.

1299
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:37,226
You know, that's the kind of
an eye Davidson has, all right.

1300
00:56:38,185 --> 00:56:41,105
Looks right into you and knows
what you're trying to hide.

1301
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,318
I guess it wouldn't be
any use to try

1302
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,945
and hide much from him,
would it?

1303
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,405
Not much.

1304
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:57,371
What'd he say?

1305
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,665
I'm sorry, Miss Thompson.

1306
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,711
That's all right.

1307
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,504
Thanks just the same.

1308
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:47,964
I'm sorry for what I said
to you today.

1309
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:50,091
For everything that's
happened, I ask pardon.

1310
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:51,634
I guess my back is broad
enough

1311
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,177
to bear it a few hard words.

1312
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:56,013
You've got me beat.

1313
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:56,889
I'm all in.

1314
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,392
Aw, don't make me go back
to San Francisco, please.

1315
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:00,977
I'll go anywhere else you say.

1316
00:58:01,018 --> 00:58:03,771
Why don't you want to
go back there?

1317
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,065
Well, my folks live there

1318
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,567
and I guess I don't want
them to see me like this.

1319
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,277
I understood you had
no people.

1320
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:12,780
I've got a father.

1321
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,091
But you told me yourself
your father

1322
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,616
did not live in San Francisco.

1323
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,050
Come, that's not the reason Miss
Thompson.

1324
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,056
What is the reason you
don't want to go back there?

1325
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:21,872
I told ya.

1326
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:23,290
No, no, you haven't told me.

1327
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,252
Well, it's this way.

1328
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:28,671
I'm trying to go straight now

1329
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,007
and if I go back there,
I can't go straight.

1330
00:58:31,048 --> 00:58:32,883
What will prevent
you from going straight

1331
00:58:32,925 --> 00:58:33,968
if you really want to?

1332
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,529
There's a man back
there that won't let me.

1333
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,679
Why won't he let you?

1334
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,181
He just won't.

1335
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:41,142
You see, it's this way.

1336
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,270
I'm scared he'll get me again.

1337
00:58:44,311 --> 00:58:45,311
Who is this man?

1338
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,065
Sort of a politician.

1339
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,276
I see, and you fear his
influence, eh?

1340
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:51,819
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1341
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,864
You see, he's bad and
I'm scared of him.

1342
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:56,824
Does he need to know
that you have returned?

1343
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,866
Ah, he'll know.

1344
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:01,495
Miss Thompson, San
Francisco is a big place.

1345
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:02,723
It should not be difficult
for you

1346
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,832
to keep out of his way
if you want to.

1347
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,751
Well, I'll have to
get help once I get back

1348
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:08,753
and the only people
that will help me

1349
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:09,754
are in with him.

1350
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:11,422
If you earnestly desire to go
straight,

1351
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,548
it will not be necessary

1352
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,967
for you to go to your
former friends for help.

1353
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,218
My foundation will help you

1354
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,845
until you are on your feet.

1355
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,139
This man you fear need never
know you are in the city.

1356
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,182
Oh, he'll know though.

1357
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:24,560
All the boats coming in are
being watched.

1358
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,519
You mean to tell me that every
boat

1359
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,854
coming into port will be watched

1360
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,522
on the chance that you are
on it?

1361
00:59:30,691 --> 00:59:32,485
- Yes.
- Come, come, Miss Thompson.

1362
00:59:32,526 --> 00:59:35,029
These evasions are getting you
nowhere.

1363
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,364
Why are you afraid to
return to San Francisco?

1364
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:38,240
I told you,

1365
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:39,551
because I can't go straight
there.

1366
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:42,078
Shall I tell you why
you're afraid to go back?

1367
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:44,705
This politician you fear is
a politician in a uniform,

1368
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,873
he wears a badge.

1369
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,625
What you fear is the
penitentiary.

1370
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,127
Oh, don't send me back,
please.

1371
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,046
I'll be good, honest I will.

1372
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,339
Is that it, the penitentiary?

1373
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,298
But I was framed.

1374
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,609
I got away before they caught
me.

1375
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,385
PD will nab me the minute
I get off that boat.

1376
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,554
It'll be three years of mine,
three years.

1377
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:01,931
Oh, give me a chance, will you?

1378
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:02,765
Just one chance?

1379
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,643
I'm going to give you the
finest chance you've ever had.

1380
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:08,705
I don't have to go back, you
mean?

1381
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:09,998
Yes, you will have to go back.

1382
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,982
You will sail for San Francisco
Tuesday

1383
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:13,400
as the governor has ordered.

1384
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:18,465
If you are truly repentant,

1385
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,199
you will accept this punishment.

1386
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,327
You will offer it as the
atonement for your sins.

1387
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,703
When you want me, Sadie
Thompson,

1388
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:26,205
call me, I will come.

1389
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,540
At any hour of the day or night

1390
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:29,166
when you need me, I will come.

1391
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,961
I shall be waiting for your
call.

1392
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,427
Mr. Davidson, wait a minute.

1393
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,305
You're right, Mr. Davidson.

1394
01:00:43,347 --> 01:00:44,473
I am bad,

1395
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,143
but I want to be good
only I don't know how.

1396
01:00:47,184 --> 01:00:48,936
So, I'll tell you what,

1397
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,396
you let me stay here with you

1398
01:00:50,437 --> 01:00:51,981
and then you can tell me
what to do.

1399
01:00:52,022 --> 01:00:54,066
No matter what it is,
I'll do it for you.

1400
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,111
You can't stay here.

1401
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:57,945
You've got to go back.

1402
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,905
You've got to serve your time.

1403
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:05,411
You mean to say if I
repent and want to be good,

1404
01:01:05,452 --> 01:01:07,413
I still have to go to the
penitentiary?

1405
01:01:07,454 --> 01:01:09,081
Yes, you've got to go.

1406
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,543
All right.

1407
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,461
You send me back there
and that's my finish.

1408
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:16,463
No, it will be your beginning.

1409
01:01:16,505 --> 01:01:18,174
But I was framed, I tell you.

1410
01:01:18,215 --> 01:01:20,634
Innocent or guilty, you have
got to serve your sentence.

1411
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:22,219
It's the only way you can prove

1412
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:23,596
you are worthy of mercy.

1413
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:29,101
Innocent or guilty, what
are you talking about?

1414
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:30,728
Where's your mercy?

1415
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,523
Oh no, I guess that
repentant stuff is off.

1416
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,276
Was it ever on, Miss Thompson?

1417
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,695
Whether it was or not,
it's off now.

1418
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,822
You've got to go back to San
Francisco.

1419
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,575
Straight orders from
your private heaven, huh?

1420
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,203
Oh no, Mr. Davidson,
your god and me

1421
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:48,704
could never be shipmates

1422
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,705
and the next time you talk
to him

1423
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,290
you can tell him this for me,

1424
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,667
that Sadie Thompson is on her
way to hell.

1425
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:54,793
Stop!

1426
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:55,961
This has gone far enough.

1427
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,547
Oh no, it hasn't gone
far enough.

1428
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,233
You've been telling me
what's wrong with me,

1429
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:02,343
now I'm gonna tell you
what's wrong with you.

1430
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:04,011
You keep yelling at me
to be punished,

1431
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,512
to go back and suffer.

1432
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:06,972
How do you know what I've
suffered?

1433
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:07,973
You don't know, you don't care

1434
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:08,807
and you don't even ask

1435
01:02:08,849 --> 01:02:10,726
and you call yourself
a Christian.

1436
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:11,828
Our Father who art in heaven-

1437
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:13,079
- Well, you're nothing but
a miserable witch-burner-

1438
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:13,896
- Hallowed be thy name.
- That's what you are.

1439
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:14,998
- You believe in torture.
- Thy kingdom come.

1440
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,274
You know you're big and
you know you're strong-

1441
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,192
- Thy will be done.

1442
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,026
And you got the
on your side

1443
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,128
and the power to hang me,
all right!

1444
01:02:20,152 --> 01:02:22,363
But I've got the power
to stand here

1445
01:02:22,404 --> 01:02:24,365
and say you hang me,
and be damned to you.

1446
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,343
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1447
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,868
Lead us not into temptation

1448
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,954
but deliver us from evil

1449
01:02:29,995 --> 01:02:31,413
for thine is the Kingdom,

1450
01:02:31,455 --> 01:02:33,123
the power and the glory.

1451
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:35,793
Forever and ever, Amen.

1452
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:37,753
Oh Lord, hear thou my prayers

1453
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,630
for this lost sister.

1454
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:43,050
Close thy ears to her
wild and heedless words.

1455
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,511
Our Father who art in Heaven,

1456
01:02:45,552 --> 01:02:47,346
hallowed be thy name.

1457
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:49,098
Thy Kingdom come,

1458
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:51,976
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven.

1459
01:02:52,017 --> 01:02:54,353
Give us this day our daily
bread.

1460
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,896
Forgive us our trespasses

1461
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,774
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1462
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,401
Lead us not into temptation

1463
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:02,278
but deliver us from evil

1464
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,779
for thine is the Kingdom,

1465
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,739
the power and the glory.

1466
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,700
Forever and ever, Amen.

1467
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:11,245
Our Father who art in Heaven,

1468
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,455
hallowed be thy name.

1469
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:15,291
Thy Kingdom come,

1470
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:17,584
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven.

1471
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:18,627
Heaven.

1472
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,504
Give us this day, our daily
bread.

1473
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,631
- Bread.
- Forgive us our trespasses-

1474
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:25,801
- As we forgive those
that trespass against us.

1475
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,469
Lead us not into temptation

1476
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:29,596
but deliver us from evil

1477
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:31,390
for thine is the Kingdom,

1478
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,600
the power and the glory.

1479
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:35,561
Forever and ever, Amen.

1480
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:39,565
Our Father who art in Heaven,

1481
01:03:39,606 --> 01:03:42,026
hallowed be thy name.

1482
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:43,485
Thy Kingdom come,

1483
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:48,073
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven.

1484
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:50,826
Give us this day our daily
bread.

1485
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,411
Forgive us our trespasses

1486
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:55,205
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1487
01:03:56,081 --> 01:03:58,292
Lead us not into temptation

1488
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,336
but deliver us from evil

1489
01:04:00,377 --> 01:04:02,212
for thine is the Kingdom,

1490
01:04:02,254 --> 01:04:04,548
the power and the glory.

1491
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,217
Forever and ever, Amen.

1492
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:51,280
You got my clothes?

1493
01:05:51,321 --> 01:05:52,865
Everything's here.

1494
01:05:52,906 --> 01:05:54,158
I'll be out in a few minutes.

1495
01:05:58,745 --> 01:06:01,999
Everything goeth,
everything returneth.

1496
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,043
Eternally roam us,
the wheel of existence.

1497
01:06:05,085 --> 01:06:09,214
Everything dyeth, everything
blossometh forth again.

1498
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:12,426
Eternally run us on the year
of existence

1499
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,344
thus spake Zarathustra.

1500
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:17,347
Ah, good old Nietzsche.

1501
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:19,683
You speak fine, Joe.

1502
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,725
What do you mean?

1503
01:06:24,229 --> 01:06:26,064
Tomorrow, she goeth

1504
01:06:26,106 --> 01:06:27,816
thus endeth that episode.

1505
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:37,659
I expect we better go back,

1506
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:39,301
I have a feeling that
something is wrong.

1507
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:43,540
But the other dances
are about to begin.

1508
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,125
We ought to be here
to prevent them.

1509
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,460
That girl and her salvation

1510
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,338
are more important to me
now than anything else.

1511
01:06:49,379 --> 01:06:50,172
I've got to go.

1512
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,316
If you aren't going
to stop this dancing,

1513
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,091
I personally would like
to see it through.

1514
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:54,176
Oh, stop it.

1515
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,010
Perhaps Doctor,
you wouldn't mind

1516
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,678
escorting the ladies home.

1517
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,683
I must go.

1518
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:05,812
How is she?

1519
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:07,022
Not so good.

1520
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:11,193
Has she wondered why
I haven't been around?

1521
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:12,819
Nope.

1522
01:07:12,861 --> 01:07:14,488
Didn't you tell her, you old
pelican,

1523
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,697
that they had me in the brig?

1524
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:17,616
Nope, she didn't ask.

1525
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:18,909
She didn't ask?

1526
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,453
Nope, she didn't even inquire
about you.

1527
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,041
I'm asking because the
last time I seen her,

1528
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,210
we were pretty good friends.

1529
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,503
You don't suppose, do you,

1530
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,756
that she's had time to think
about you or anything else

1531
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,341
with Davidson getting her
ready to go

1532
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,801
back to San Francisco?

1533
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,179
What's he been doing to her?

1534
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:40,556
Praying.

1535
01:07:40,597 --> 01:07:41,807
Praying?

1536
01:07:41,848 --> 01:07:43,016
Praying.

1537
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:45,727
Got her beached with
the Psalm stuff, huh?

1538
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:48,522
Beached and delirious,
I'd say.

1539
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,690
He took pretty good care

1540
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:52,234
to get rid of me before
he started, didn't he?

1541
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,570
Well, I'll beat him to it
tonight.

1542
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:55,737
How did you get out?

1543
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,949
Walked out.

1544
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,160
Hmm, what's the doing O'Hara?

1545
01:08:03,203 --> 01:08:05,038
You arouse my curiosity.

1546
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:07,666
If I was you,
I'd ease off to bed

1547
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,127
with the old lady and
not have any curiosity.

1548
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:14,006
Oh, you would, would you?

1549
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,092
Now why would you do that?

1550
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,762
I'd do that so as I wouldn't
be blamed for anything

1551
01:08:20,804 --> 01:08:22,639
in case anything happened.

1552
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,516
Sounds like another row is
starting.

1553
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,185
The most unlucky day of my life

1554
01:08:27,227 --> 01:08:29,730
is the day that
came into port.

1555
01:08:29,771 --> 01:08:31,231
Ameena,

1556
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,273
lock up.

1557
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:34,443
I like my comfort.

1558
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,196
For five days now, this
whole household has centered

1559
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,240
on that tormented Thompson girl
in there

1560
01:08:41,074 --> 01:08:44,453
with Davidson and Old Nick
wrestling for her soul.

1561
01:08:44,494 --> 01:08:45,954
It's got me nervous.

1562
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:48,665
Cheer up, it won't center
around her much longer.

1563
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:49,958
What do you know about it?

1564
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,460
Safe in the brig all week.

1565
01:08:52,544 --> 01:08:54,504
There hasn't been such
a casting out of devils

1566
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:56,256
since the first chapter of
Exodus.

1567
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,051
The last vestige of mortal sin

1568
01:08:59,092 --> 01:09:00,719
lurking in that poor critter's
heart

1569
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:01,762
has been torn out.

1570
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:05,807
The Sadie Thompson who blew
into my hotel a week ago

1571
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:06,849
isn't anymore.

1572
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,977
Wait 'til you see her.

1573
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,859
Aren't keeping anything
from me, are you Joe?

1574
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,939
Wait 'til you see her, I say.

1575
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:14,858
She's like a victim
they've got trussed up

1576
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,818
to sacrifice to some
bloody idol.

1577
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:20,364
Yeah, it'll make you sick to
look at her.

1578
01:09:20,405 --> 01:09:21,198
Get her out for me,

1579
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:22,342
I'll tend to the rest of this.

1580
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,575
Gladly.

1581
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,620
My mind is blank save
for one fact.

1582
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,456
Tomorrow Miss Sadie Thompson
will be on the high seas.

1583
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,832
You bet she'll be.

1584
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,044
Miss Thompson, you're wanted.

1585
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,754
All right.

1586
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,312
Sadie, you look awful sick.

1587
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,942
I was wondering whether
I'd see you before I left.

1588
01:09:57,859 --> 01:09:59,111
You've been awful kind.

1589
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:01,488
I'll never forget it.

1590
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,199
I want to thank you.

1591
01:10:09,871 --> 01:10:11,415
Look here, Sadie,

1592
01:10:11,456 --> 01:10:13,750
how long will it take you
to get packed?

1593
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,293
I'm pretty well packed now.

1594
01:10:15,335 --> 01:10:16,461
That's good,

1595
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:18,839
Briggs and Hudson will
be along any minute.

1596
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,424
They're to tote your bags.

1597
01:10:20,465 --> 01:10:23,510
You hurry up now and get
dressed as fast as you can.

1598
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,137
Get dressed?

1599
01:10:25,178 --> 01:10:26,888
You're leaving this place
tonight.

1600
01:10:29,182 --> 01:10:32,060
My boat don't leave
until tomorrow morning.

1601
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,478
Your boat's leaving tonight

1602
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,731
and I'm going to see you
get aboard it.

1603
01:10:35,772 --> 01:10:37,566
I must wait for Mr. Davidson.

1604
01:10:37,607 --> 01:10:39,693
He's going to see me on board.

1605
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:44,281
Mr. Davidson isn't going to
see you off.

1606
01:10:44,322 --> 01:10:45,949
He isn't?

1607
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:48,285
What's happened? Where is he?

1608
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:49,911
You're not going to San
Francisco,

1609
01:10:49,953 --> 01:10:51,830
that's what's happened.

1610
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:52,831
You're leaving here in a few
minutes

1611
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,541
for the Samarcan Islands
and a junk.

1612
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,060
You're to wait there until
the Sydney boat comes along

1613
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:57,419
and then you're going
to Sydney.

1614
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:04,551
But, what do you suppose
Mr. Davidson would say

1615
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:07,429
if he came back
and found me gone?

1616
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,848
You know the old
shout-out better than I do

1617
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,807
but I don't mind admitting

1618
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:11,909
that the sight of his face
at that moment

1619
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:13,810
would slip me considerable,
quiet fun.

1620
01:11:24,362 --> 01:11:27,115
You've had a pretty bad time
these last few days, I guess.

1621
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,492
Just forget him.

1622
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,410
That's mighty sweet
and fine of you

1623
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,204
to go through all this trouble
for me.

1624
01:11:32,245 --> 01:11:34,372
Fine, fine nothing.

1625
01:11:34,414 --> 01:11:35,624
This ain't one small bit

1626
01:11:35,665 --> 01:11:38,043
of what I'd like to do for
you, if I got the chance.

1627
01:11:38,084 --> 01:11:40,587
You know, your doing this

1628
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:45,050
sort of makes me want
to cry but-

1629
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:46,718
- But what?

1630
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,762
I can't do it.

1631
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:49,930
Why can't you do it?

1632
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:54,893
I'm going through with what
I've got to go through with.

1633
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,353
Are you afraid of Davidson?

1634
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:58,188
He'll never get a hold of you
again,

1635
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,523
I'll see to that.

1636
01:11:59,564 --> 01:12:02,275
No, that isn't it.

1637
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:04,861
It'd be awful hard for
me to make you understand

1638
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:05,946
what's come over me.

1639
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:08,740
I can't understand it myself

1640
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,159
except that it's happened.

1641
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:14,162
Sadie, this sort of
thing don't make you happy.

1642
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,872
You don't realize it ain't
yourself.

1643
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:18,333
You've got to forget Mr.
Davidson,

1644
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,335
and come with me.

1645
01:12:21,586 --> 01:12:23,505
No, I couldn't.

1646
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:24,881
I couldn't.

1647
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,925
You don't know
what you're saying.

1648
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,094
You haven't any idea
what you're saying.

1649
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:30,446
They're not gonna send you
back there

1650
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:32,430
with no one to take care of you.

1651
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:33,741
In Sydney, in a couple of weeks,

1652
01:12:33,765 --> 01:12:35,100
you'll have me.

1653
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,895
Remember what I told you
about Lefty and Maggie?

1654
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:39,813
I won't listen,

1655
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,439
I won't listen.

1656
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:42,625
What's to hinder you repenting
in Sydney

1657
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,860
as well as in San Francisco,

1658
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:46,278
if you got to repent?

1659
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:48,280
Oh, you don't understand.

1660
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:53,451
I've got to go back and be
punished for what I've been.

1661
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,413
What's that you're saying?

1662
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,710
When I get back to
San Francisco, handsome,

1663
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,589
I've got to go to the
penitentiary for three years.

1664
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,302
Gee.

1665
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:16,850
Mr. Davidson says it
doesn't make any difference

1666
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,768
whether I was innocent or guilty

1667
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,187
of what they framed me for.

1668
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:23,899
He says

1669
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:28,361
it's the only way of
letting me square myself.

1670
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:35,118
He says I've got to accept
an unjust punishment

1671
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,538
by man as a sacrifice
for my sins.

1672
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,809
Oh, you listen to me,
get in your room

1673
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:43,311
and throw your clothes
on as fast as you can.

1674
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,502
Let go of me.

1675
01:13:44,544 --> 01:13:45,962
Let go.

1676
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,881
Don't you dare do that again.

1677
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,382
I want you to go away,
do you hear?

1678
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:50,216
Go away.

1679
01:13:50,258 --> 01:13:52,427
- Sadie, Sadie.
- I mean it, go away.

1680
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,429
Aw, Sadie, listen please.

1681
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,264
Aw, handsome, why
can't you let me alone?

1682
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:58,433
Here are the boys, Sadie.

1683
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,352
Come to say goodbye to you.

1684
01:14:00,393 --> 01:14:02,413
They're going to put your
things aboard the junk for you.

1685
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:03,438
No, don't.

1686
01:14:04,522 --> 01:14:07,484
Why doesn't Mr. Davidson come?

1687
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:08,860
Where is he?

1688
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:09,903
Where is he?

1689
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:13,591
See if there isn't a coat
or something in that room,

1690
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:15,301
that old peeler's got
her like she's tranced.

1691
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,369
We're taking her whether
she wants to go or not.

1692
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:24,709
They're taking my things.

1693
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:25,919
They mustn't take my things.

1694
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,438
- Sadie, don't.
- Someone will hear you.

1695
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:29,756
Let me go, go away.

1696
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,968
Oh, handsome,
why can't you let me be?

1697
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,890
Don't you see, Sadie,

1698
01:14:38,932 --> 01:14:40,308
you ain't yourself?

1699
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,352
I am, I am myself.

1700
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,814
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1701
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:49,109
Mr. Davidson's a holy man.

1702
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,653
He's different from you and me.

1703
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,447
He's made me different.

1704
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:56,866
I've been born all over again,
handsome.

1705
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:58,451
Can't you see?

1706
01:14:58,493 --> 01:14:59,285
Yes, I see

1707
01:14:59,327 --> 01:15:01,413
and I see something else.

1708
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:03,307
Remember I told you if
you ever needed a friend,

1709
01:15:03,331 --> 01:15:04,791
I'd be here?

1710
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,793
Well, you need a friend right
now.

1711
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,170
You're not going to San
Francisco.

1712
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:10,964
You're going to Sydney.

1713
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:14,968
Sadie, out there you've got
your whole life before you.

1714
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,219
We go away where this rain

1715
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,221
or anything else
can't bother us,

1716
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,015
just you and me,

1717
01:15:20,056 --> 01:15:22,225
like Lefty and Maggie.

1718
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,309
Fifty-fifty.

1719
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:26,104
You'll be Mrs. Tim O'Hara.

1720
01:15:27,063 --> 01:15:28,148
It's Sydney and us,

1721
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:31,526
the whole works against the
penitentiary

1722
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,570
and I'm taking you whether
you want to go or not.

1723
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:35,238
No, no you mustn't.

1724
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,280
You mustn't.

1725
01:15:38,783 --> 01:15:40,035
I'm saved, I tell you.

1726
01:15:40,076 --> 01:15:41,536
You'll send me to hell.

1727
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:44,164
Mr. Davidson, Mr. Da...

1728
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:46,916
Seems I got here just about
in time.

1729
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:49,562
All evening, I had
a peculiar feeling

1730
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,628
you were in danger.

1731
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,173
Sadie, don't pay any attention
to him.

1732
01:15:53,214 --> 01:15:54,549
I'm sorry for you, O'Hara,

1733
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:56,843
what you are trying to
do is a serious offense.

1734
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,928
What you're trying to
do would make a hyena cry.

1735
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,430
By trying to abduct Sadie
Thompson,

1736
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:01,949
you've made an attempt
to defeat the law

1737
01:16:01,973 --> 01:16:03,200
and it's likely to go hard
with you.

1738
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:04,392
That's my lookout.

1739
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:05,661
What kind of a man are you,
anyway?

1740
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:07,187
Picking on this poor kid here,

1741
01:16:07,228 --> 01:16:08,730
getting her so she's half-crazy.

1742
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,583
Sending her so she'd have
to go back to prison.

1743
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:12,275
You're one choice specimen,
Davidson,

1744
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,568
I'll say that for you.

1745
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,111
They don't make your kind
everyday.

1746
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:16,905
You are a reckless,
headstrong man O'Hara.

1747
01:16:16,946 --> 01:16:17,864
You are breaking barracks

1748
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,324
and attempting a high-handed
crime.

1749
01:16:19,365 --> 01:16:21,326
You defy the authority
of State and God.

1750
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:22,720
You cannot go on the way
you are going

1751
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,329
and I shall see to it that you
do not.

1752
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,789
Begging your pardon,
might I ask,

1753
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:26,748
what you think you're gonna
do about it?

1754
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:27,933
Get back to your
barracks as fast as you can

1755
01:16:27,957 --> 01:16:30,752
and report here to me tomorrow
after Miss Thompson is gone.

1756
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,254
Ha, where do you get these
ideas anyway?

1757
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:35,465
If it's good advice you
want to ladle out, keep it.

1758
01:16:35,507 --> 01:16:36,883
On such rare moments as I think,

1759
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,218
I think for myself.

1760
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:39,445
This is not helping your case.

1761
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,261
Watch what you say.

1762
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:41,387
I'm here to watch out

1763
01:16:41,429 --> 01:16:42,972
that Sadie don't make any fool
breaks.

1764
01:16:43,014 --> 01:16:44,033
You've got to do some settling
with me

1765
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,350
before she does any sailing.

1766
01:16:45,391 --> 01:16:46,935
You're wrong.

1767
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:48,353
I know what I'm doing.

1768
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:50,188
I'm sorry but I see clear.

1769
01:16:51,272 --> 01:16:52,440
See clear?

1770
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:54,359
Why he's got you so
it's like you're doped.

1771
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,860
I see what you don't see.

1772
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:00,156
What's happened to me
don't happen to everybody.

1773
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,616
I was nothing.

1774
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:02,658
I was nobody.

1775
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,161
Now I'm something.

1776
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:06,203
I'm somebody.

1777
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:08,832
It's a wonderful thing to know

1778
01:17:08,873 --> 01:17:11,376
you're being made of some
account.

1779
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:14,712
The only thing I can't see
is how it's happened to me.

1780
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,925
Is that the way it is, Sadie?

1781
01:17:20,051 --> 01:17:21,051
Yes.

1782
01:17:22,178 --> 01:17:24,514
What do you want me to do?

1783
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,977
I don't want you to do
anything

1784
01:17:29,018 --> 01:17:32,021
except just don't say
anything more.

1785
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,403
All right, I'll tell the
boys to bring your things back.

1786
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:45,869
Sadie, if you and me never
see each other again,

1787
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:48,997
I want to say this.

1788
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,167
I'll never forget you,

1789
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:55,043
ever.

1790
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:04,929
If you'd like,

1791
01:18:06,222 --> 01:18:07,223
I'll come back tomorrow

1792
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:09,434
and put your things
aboard the boat for you,

1793
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,103
if you want me to.

1794
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,411
- Don't blame O'Hara, Mr.
- Davidson.

1795
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:31,831
It was all my fault.

1796
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:32,665
No, my poor child,

1797
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:34,209
it was not your fault.

1798
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:36,252
In the last few days,

1799
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:39,631
you've become very close and
dear to God.

1800
01:18:39,672 --> 01:18:41,883
He has tested you and found you
true.

1801
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:43,927
Tonight, he sent the devil
to tempt you

1802
01:18:43,968 --> 01:18:45,511
but you thrust away the devil.

1803
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,098
Once your soul lay
like a stagnant pool

1804
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:51,726
in the lowest pit of the
deepest valley,

1805
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:53,937
but tonight it has lifted
to the sun,

1806
01:18:55,396 --> 01:18:58,358
cleansed, glorified as the rain
of heaven.

1807
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:03,571
When you're here, everything's
clear.

1808
01:19:04,822 --> 01:19:05,949
Everything's all right.

1809
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:08,660
But when you're away,

1810
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:10,702
I'm afraid.

1811
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:14,916
I get to thinking how wicked
I used to be

1812
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,212
and I just can't believe
it's all forgiven.

1813
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:22,507
The days aren't so bad

1814
01:19:22,548 --> 01:19:24,342
but it's the nights.

1815
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,720
Then I begin to think and wonder

1816
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:29,805
if they're bad now,

1817
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:33,601
what are they gonna be like

1818
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,561
when you can't come to me
anymore,

1819
01:19:35,603 --> 01:19:36,688
when I'm alone?

1820
01:19:36,729 --> 01:19:37,522
When you're alone,

1821
01:19:37,563 --> 01:19:39,649
my strength will come
to you through prayers

1822
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:42,402
which will always be on my lips.

1823
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:43,236
Little by little,

1824
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,863
you yourself will grow stronger,
surer,

1825
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:47,407
and presently the time will come

1826
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:49,617
when sin and terror will be
powerless

1827
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:52,954
to penetrate the great love
that God has wrapped around you.

1828
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,416
Then will you be redeemed,

1829
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:58,459
the Kingdom and the Glory
will be yours.

1830
01:20:00,044 --> 01:20:01,462
Yes.

1831
01:20:01,504 --> 01:20:02,504
Yes.

1832
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,758
When you talk like that,

1833
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:06,843
I'm not afraid.

1834
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:12,140
That old life I led don't
belong to me at all.

1835
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:14,433
It wasn't me,

1836
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,394
it was someone else.

1837
01:20:17,812 --> 01:20:20,565
When I feel like that, Mr.
Davidson,

1838
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:24,068
does it mean I'm redeemed?

1839
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,737
Yes, Sadie.

1840
01:20:25,778 --> 01:20:27,613
Tomorrow will be a very busy day
for you.

1841
01:20:27,655 --> 01:20:29,157
You'll need all your strength.

1842
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:32,035
You must try and
get some sleep now.

1843
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,459
No.

1844
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,500
But,

1845
01:20:41,419 --> 01:20:44,797
if I wake up tonight
and get afraid,

1846
01:20:44,839 --> 01:20:46,007
can I call you?

1847
01:20:46,049 --> 01:20:47,091
When I hear you call,

1848
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,133
I will come.

1849
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,305
I'm really tired.

1850
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:22,251
Hello, Horn, you still up?

1851
01:21:22,293 --> 01:21:23,920
Yep, reading.

1852
01:21:23,961 --> 01:21:24,754
Want anything?

1853
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:26,381
Nope, I'm off to bed.

1854
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,927
There's an uncanny concentration
about the rain tonight.

1855
01:21:32,136 --> 01:21:33,179
Perhaps.

1856
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,514
Everybody in?

1857
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:37,392
Davidson is still out,
can't sleep.

1858
01:21:37,433 --> 01:21:38,935
Can't sleep, eh?

1859
01:21:38,976 --> 01:21:42,271
Has uneasy dreams,
his wife tells me.

1860
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:46,943
'Night.

1861
01:21:46,984 --> 01:21:47,985
Goodnight.

1862
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:07,588
Everything goeth,
everything returneth,

1863
01:22:07,630 --> 01:22:09,757
so rolleth the wheel of
existence.

1864
01:22:10,883 --> 01:22:14,095
Everything dieth, everything
marches forth again.

1865
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:17,140
So runneth the year of
existence.

1866
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,273
Thus spake Zarathustra.

1867
01:22:47,712 --> 01:22:48,712
Mr. Davidson.

1868
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,508
Hello Miss Thompson,
what are you up for?

1869
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,760
I couldn't sleep.

1870
01:22:54,802 --> 01:22:56,471
It's this rain and those drums,

1871
01:22:57,972 --> 01:23:00,600
and then thinking about
tomorrow.

1872
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:06,022
I don't seem to be able to
do much by myself, do I?

1873
01:23:06,063 --> 01:23:06,898
Not yet maybe,

1874
01:23:06,939 --> 01:23:09,400
but every prayer is going
to make you stronger.

1875
01:23:12,028 --> 01:23:13,196
This time tomorrow,

1876
01:23:13,237 --> 01:23:14,322
I'll be on the sea.

1877
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:19,160
I don't suppose we'll
ever meet again.

1878
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:22,205
Not in this life, Sadie,
probably.

1879
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,249
I'll be in prison three years.

1880
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,543
That's a long time.

1881
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:31,464
What'll I do when I come out?

1882
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,506
What'll I be?

1883
01:23:33,716 --> 01:23:37,428
For hours and hours, I've been
wondering.

1884
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,097
Out there in the rain,
I walked and wondered too.

1885
01:23:40,139 --> 01:23:42,517
The darkness was full of eyes.

1886
01:23:42,558 --> 01:23:45,394
I saw things I never saw before.

1887
01:23:45,436 --> 01:23:48,189
I looked into the awful
groves of Astroth herself.

1888
01:23:50,733 --> 01:23:53,528
Sadie, you don't have to
go back to San Francisco.

1889
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:56,531
- What do you mean?
- Just that.

1890
01:23:58,824 --> 01:24:01,035
Didn't you tell me I
had to make a sacrifice?

1891
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,287
Yes, but I repeat you
don't have to go back

1892
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:04,622
unless you truly want to.

1893
01:24:05,456 --> 01:24:07,583
But I do want to.

1894
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:09,794
I haven't got anything else
to offer.

1895
01:24:09,835 --> 01:24:12,004
It's the only thing
I've got to give

1896
01:24:12,046 --> 01:24:13,422
and I want to give it.

1897
01:24:13,464 --> 01:24:14,882
I thank thee.

1898
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:15,925
I thank thee.

1899
01:24:17,301 --> 01:24:19,554
- Why do you say that, Mr.
- Davidson?

1900
01:24:19,595 --> 01:24:21,889
Because you said what
I knew you'd say.

1901
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:24,850
My every prayer
has been answered.

1902
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:26,852
I prayed that there might
come into your heart.

1903
01:24:26,894 --> 01:24:29,438
So passionate a desire
for this punishment

1904
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,107
which you now lay
as a thank offering

1905
01:24:31,148 --> 01:24:34,569
at your redeemer's feet that
even if I offered to let you go

1906
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:35,987
you would refuse.

1907
01:24:36,028 --> 01:24:39,865
I hope I'll be strong enough
to go through with it right.

1908
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,511
From now on,
you will be strong.

1909
01:24:42,535 --> 01:24:44,579
There is to be no more fear.

1910
01:24:46,497 --> 01:24:48,666
Radiant, beautiful,

1911
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:52,670
you'll be one of the
daughters of the King.

1912
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,132
That's what you are now, Sadie,

1913
01:24:56,173 --> 01:24:57,842
one of the daughters
of the King,

1914
01:24:59,093 --> 01:25:00,761
radiant, beautiful.

1915
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,934
I think I'll go now

1916
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:09,145
and try to get some sleep.

1917
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,918
It's Davidson.

1918
01:28:18,959 --> 01:28:19,919
He isn't dead, is he?

1919
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:20,753
Throat's cut.

1920
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:21,962
Been dead for several hours.

1921
01:28:22,004 --> 01:28:22,797
Suicide.

1922
01:28:22,838 --> 01:28:23,798
I must tell Mrs. Davidson.

1923
01:28:23,839 --> 01:28:25,758
No, I'll go back and tell her.

1924
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,219
I hate to do it but I guess
she knows something already.

1925
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,804
She heard the boys
calling for you.

1926
01:28:29,845 --> 01:28:30,845
Better hurry.

1927
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:37,478
I wonder why he did it.

1928
01:29:04,463 --> 01:29:05,463
Joe.

1929
01:29:06,715 --> 01:29:08,050
Where's Miss Thompson?

1930
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:08,884
How did you know about it?

1931
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:09,802
One of the boys told me.

1932
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:10,904
I came over here
as fast as I could

1933
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,263
in case Sadie needed me.

1934
01:29:12,304 --> 01:29:13,430
You don't think,

1935
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,223
there isn't any chance

1936
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:15,534
of Sadie being mixed up in this,
is there?

1937
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,601
No, he did it himself.

1938
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:19,520
I hope they don't bring him
in here.

1939
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,313
I don't like men that die
that way.

1940
01:29:21,355 --> 01:29:22,231
They don't rest easy.

1941
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:23,273
Wait a minute.

1942
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:34,159
Pretty cool, I'll say.

1943
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:37,329
Yeah, well, anyway I'm glad
I didn't have to tell her.

1944
01:29:37,371 --> 01:29:38,956
I wonder how she'll take it.

1945
01:29:40,082 --> 01:29:41,142
I wonder,

1946
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,626
Now what?

1947
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:43,668
Listen to that.

1948
01:29:47,172 --> 01:29:49,008
See? She don't know yet.

1949
01:29:49,049 --> 01:29:50,801
Man, why is she playing?

1950
01:29:52,177 --> 01:29:53,405
One of us ought to go in
and tell her what's happened.

1951
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,139
She hasn't touched that thing

1952
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:56,807
since Davidson went after her.

1953
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:58,934
What's she playing it now for?

1954
01:29:58,976 --> 01:29:59,768
I don't know.

1955
01:29:59,810 --> 01:30:01,645
Look here, last night
she was frightened

1956
01:30:01,687 --> 01:30:04,148
and all-in about going
back to San Francisco.

1957
01:30:04,189 --> 01:30:06,901
Why is she playing that thing
the first thing this morning

1958
01:30:06,942 --> 01:30:10,029
when at noon she's going on a
journey she's afraid to make?

1959
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:10,946
Why?

1960
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:12,197
How should I know?

1961
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,366
- What do you infer?
- I'm not inferring.

1962
01:30:14,408 --> 01:30:15,993
Who's gonna tell her, you?

1963
01:30:17,202 --> 01:30:18,746
It'll come better from you.

1964
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:19,997
Oh, all right.

1965
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:25,294
Miss Thompson?

1966
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:26,587
Yeah, what is it?

1967
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:27,963
Let me in, it's Horn.

1968
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:29,048
Oh no, you don't.

1969
01:30:29,089 --> 01:30:29,965
Stay where you are.

1970
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,050
Be out in a minute.

1971
01:30:31,091 --> 01:30:32,593
It's very important, Miss
Thompson.

1972
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:34,637
Okay, coming right up.

1973
01:30:47,107 --> 01:30:49,151
Hello, Horn, what's going on?

1974
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:53,906
Hello, handsome, what are
you doing up so early?

1975
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:54,948
Sadie.

1976
01:30:57,868 --> 01:31:00,579
Surprised to see me all dolled
up, huh?

1977
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:01,621
Well, why not?

1978
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:03,374
I had to put on my best

1979
01:31:03,415 --> 01:31:06,919
this gay and glorious morning,
didn't I?

1980
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:09,088
Besides I'm radiant, beautiful.

1981
01:31:10,547 --> 01:31:12,049
You didn't know that, did you?

1982
01:31:13,592 --> 01:31:14,385
I could hardly believe my eyes

1983
01:31:14,426 --> 01:31:16,762
when I saw that sun
this morning.

1984
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,347
Do I feel fine?

1985
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:19,431
I do.

1986
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:21,308
I'd race you down to the beach

1987
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:23,102
if it wasn't for these
pesky heels.

1988
01:31:23,143 --> 01:31:25,145
Sadie, turn off that
phonograph.

1989
01:31:25,187 --> 01:31:27,064
- Why?
- They'll be back any minute.

1990
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:29,024
- Who?
- Mrs. Davidson.

1991
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:32,653
And why should I turn off the
phonograph

1992
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:34,655
because Mrs. Davidson's coming
back?

1993
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:38,409
I'm not concerned with
what Mrs. Davidson thinks

1994
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:41,662
or for that matter, with
what Mr. Davidson thinks.

1995
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:43,580
My advice to him is
to pin on his wings

1996
01:31:43,622 --> 01:31:44,873
and try the air.

1997
01:31:44,915 --> 01:31:46,059
Joe, turn off that phonograph.

1998
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,710
Stay out of my room, Joe.

1999
01:31:47,751 --> 01:31:49,128
That phonograph stays on.

2000
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:50,438
Sadie, something has happened.

2001
01:31:50,462 --> 01:31:53,257
You bet something's happened.

2002
01:31:53,298 --> 01:31:54,550
You men.

2003
01:31:54,591 --> 01:31:55,591
Pigs.

2004
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,682
Sadie,
Davidson's killed himself.

2005
01:32:01,724 --> 01:32:03,308
What?

2006
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:05,060
They found him on the beach
this morning

2007
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:06,103
with his throat cut.

2008
01:32:10,816 --> 01:32:12,234
Killed himself.

2009
01:32:14,528 --> 01:32:16,238
Then I can forgive him.

2010
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,283
I thought the joke was all on me

2011
01:32:21,368 --> 01:32:22,911
but I see it wasn't.

2012
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:25,873
Joe.

2013
01:32:25,914 --> 01:32:26,914
Please.

2014
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:43,682
No offense to you in that
last crack I made, handsome.

2015
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:46,643
Oh, that's all right.

2016
01:32:48,103 --> 01:32:49,772
I'm going to Sydney with you

2017
01:32:49,813 --> 01:32:51,857
if the invitation
still holds good.

2018
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:15,213
Let's go.

2019
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:25,140
I understand, Miss Thompson.

2020
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:29,061
I'm sorry for him

2021
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:31,730
and I'm sorry for you.

2022
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:38,403
I'm sorry for everybody
in the world, I guess.
