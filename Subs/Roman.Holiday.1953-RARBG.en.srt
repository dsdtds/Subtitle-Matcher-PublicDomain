42
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,594
How do you do?

43
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,678
I hate this nightgown.

44
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:27,407
I hate all my nightgowns,
and I hate all my underwear, too.

45
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,749
My dear, you have lovely things.

46
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:32,119
But I'm not two hundred years old.

47
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,653
Why can't I sleep in pyjamas?

48
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:35,954
Pyjamas!

49
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:37,722
Just the top part.

50
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:41,590
Did you know there are people

51
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,601
who sleep with absolutely
nothing on at all?

52
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,602
I rejoice to say that I did not.

53
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:51,536
Listen.

54
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,612
Ann, your slippers.

55
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,918
Please put on your slippers
and come away from the window.

56
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:14,829
Your milk and crackers.

57
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,333
Everything we do is so wholesome.

58
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:20,027
They'll help you to sleep.

59
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:23,938
I'm too tired to sleep.
I shan't sleep a wink.

60
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,076
Now, my dear, if you don't mind,
tomorrow's schedule, or "schedule,"

61
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:30,637
whichever you prefer. Both are correct.

62
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:33,411
8:30, breakfast here
with the embassy staff.

63
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:36,282

the Polinari automotive works,

64
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:38,549
where you'll be presented
with a small car.

65
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:39,749
Thank you.

66
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:41,086
Which you will not accept.

67
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,183
No, thank you.

68
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,593
10:35, inspection of
food and agricultural organization,

69
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,290
will present you with an olive tree.

70
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,593
No, thank you.

71
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,566
Which you will accept.

72
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,634
Thank you.

73
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:56,534
10:55, the New Foundling Home
for Orphans.

74
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:58,666
You will preside over
the laying of the cornerstone.

75
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,040
Same speech as last Monday.

76
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,373
Trade relations.

77
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,538
Yes.

78
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:05,141
For the orphans?

79
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:07,683
No, no, no, the other one.

80
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,185
Youth and progress.

81
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:10,618
Precisely.

82
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:13,686
11:45, back here to rest.
No, that's wrong.

83
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,420
11:45, conference here with the press.

84
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:17,994
Sweetness and decency.

85
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,963
1:00 sharp, lunch with
the Foreign Ministry.

86
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:23,626
You will wear your white lace
and carry a bouquet of

87
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,135
- very small pink roses.
- Very small pink roses.

88
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,637
3:05, presentation of a plaque.

89
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:30,696
Thank you.

90
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:33,471
4:10, review Special Guard
of Carabinieri...

91
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:34,568
No, thank you.

92
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:37,011
- 4:45, back here to change...
- How do you do? Charmed.

93
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:38,981
...into your uniform to meet the...
- So happy...

94
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,176
Stop!

95
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:43,284
- Good heavens!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

96
00:09:45,022 --> 00:09:46,785
It's all right, dear. It didn't spill.

97
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:49,019
I don't care if it spilled or not.

98
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,924
I don't care if I drowned in it!

99
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,395
My dear, you're ill.

100
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,563
I'll send for Dr. Bonnachoven.

101
00:09:56,634 --> 00:10:00,070
I don't want Dr. Bonnachoven!
Please let me die in peace.

102
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:01,161
You're not dying.

103
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,536
Leave me!

104
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,367
- Leave me!
- It's nerves. Control yourself, Ann.

105
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:08,537
I don't want to!

106
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:10,137
Your Highness!

107
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,311
I'll get Dr. Bonnachoven.

108
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:14,817
It's no use.

109
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,820
I'll be dead before he gets here.

110
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:27,888
She's asleep.

111
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:31,059
She was in hysterics
three minutes ago, Doctor.

112
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:35,129
Are you asleep, ma'am?

113
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,264
No!

114
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:42,144
I'll only disturb Your Royal Highness
a moment.

115
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:44,909
I'm very ashamed, Dr. Bonnachoven.

116
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:46,916
Suddenly, I was crying.

117
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,946
To cry, a perfectly normal thing to do.

118
00:10:51,022 --> 00:10:53,115
It's most important
she be calm and relaxed

119
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,680
for the press conference, Doctor.

120
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,556
Don't worry, Doctor.

121
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:58,390
I'll be calm and relaxed.

122
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:00,555
I'll bow, and I'll smile.

123
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,122
I'll improve trade relations, and...

124
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,434
There she goes again.
Give her something, Doctor, please.

125
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:08,131
Uncover her arm, please.

126
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:13,367
What's that?

127
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:14,911
Sleep and calm.

128
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:18,813
This will relax you and
make Your Highness feel a little happy.

129
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:21,215
It's a new drug, quite harmless.

130
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:26,216
There.

131
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,852
I don't feel any different.

132
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:33,224
You will.
It may take a little time to take hold.

133
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,628
Just, now, lie back.

134
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:39,294
Can I keep just one light on?

135
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,735
Of course.

136
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,704
Best thing I know

137
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,606
is to do exactly what you wish
for a while.

138
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:49,073
Thank you, Doctor.

139
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,809
The General! Doctor, quick!

140
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:01,592
I'm perfectly all right.

141
00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,587
Good night, ma'am.

142
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:07,926
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night, Doctor.

143
00:17:01,258 --> 00:17:02,520
Bet 500.

144
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,090
500. How many?

145
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:06,821
One.

146
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,791
I'll take one.

147
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:13,163
Three.

148
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,703
Foolish boy.

149
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,544
Two for papa.

150
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:25,639
500 more.

151
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:27,343
Without looking.

152
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:29,682
500, and I'll raise you 1,000.

153
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,224
Two pairs.

154
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:42,731
I got three shy little sevens.

155
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,537
A nervous straight.
Come home, you fools.

156
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,768
Look at that. 6,500.

157
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:54,106
Not bad. That's 10 bucks.

158
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:56,874
One more round,

159
00:17:56,947 --> 00:17:59,609
and I'm going to throw you gents
right out in the snow.

160
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:01,014
Say, what is this?

161
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,882
I got to get up early.

162
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:04,352
Date with Her Royal Highness,

163
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:06,855
who will graciously
pose for some pictures.

164
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:11,190
What do you mean, early?
My personal invitation says 11:45.

165
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:13,752
Couldn't be anything to do
with the fact that you're ahead?

166
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,059
It could.

167
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:18,795
It works out fine for me.
This is my last 5,000,

168
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:22,534
and you hyenas are not gonna get it.
Thanks a lot, Irving.

169
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:24,437
Yeah, see you at
Annie's little party in the morning.

170
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:25,668
<i>- Ciao,</i> Joe.
- Yeah, <i>ciao.</i>

171
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:26,767
Good night, Joe.

172
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,574
All right, a little seven-card stud.

173
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:30,635
Okay with me.

174
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:45,593
So happy.

175
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,299
How are you this evening?

176
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,970
Hey, hey, hey.

177
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:01,511
Hey, wake up.

178
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:02,806
Thank you very much. Delighted.

179
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,211
Wake up.

180
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,805
No, thank you.

181
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:07,611
Charmed.

182
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,645
Charmed, too.

183
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:18,888
You may sit down.

184
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:21,086
I think you'd better sit up.

185
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,565
You're much too young
to get picked up by the police.

186
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:25,192
- Police?
- Yep. Police.

187
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:30,036
2:15 and back here to change. 2:45...

188
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,677
You know, people who can't handle
liquor shouldn't drink it.

189
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:42,082
"If I were dead and buried
and I heard your voice

190
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:47,522
"beneath the sod
my heart of dust would still rejoice."

191
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,293
Do you know that poem?

192
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,793
What do you know?

193
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:59,063
You're well-read, well-dressed,

194
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:02,638
snoozing away in a public street.

195
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,737
Would you care to make a statement?

196
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:10,371
What the world needs
is a return to sweetness and decency

197
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:13,007
in the souls of its young men and...

198
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:24,193
Yeah, I couldn't agree
with you more, but...

199
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:38,965
Get yourself some coffee.
You'll be all right.

200
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:03,165
Look, you take the cab.

201
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:12,908
Come on, climb in the cab
and go home.

202
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,843
- So happy.
- You got any money?

203
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,382
Never carry money.

204
00:21:19,449 --> 00:21:21,212
That's a bad habit.

205
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,849
All right. I'll drop you off. Come on.

206
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,549
It's a taxi!

207
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:28,955
Well, it's not the Super Chief.

208
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:34,924
Where are we going?

209
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,693
Where do you live?

210
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:39,327
Colosseum.

211
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:41,928
Now, come on. You're not that drunk.

212
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:46,135
You're so smart. I'm not drunk at all.

213
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,611
I'm just being very happy.

214
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,171
There, now, don't go to sleep again.
Come on.

215
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:56,118
Where are we going?

216
00:21:58,488 --> 00:22:00,615
- Okay.
- Look, now, where do you want to go?

217
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:02,591
Where shall I take you?

218
00:22:04,695 --> 00:22:06,390
Where do you live?

219
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:10,532
Come on. Come on. Where do you live?

220
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:14,295
Come on! Where do you live?

221
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,304
Colosseum.

222
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:23,842
She lives in the Colosseum.

223
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:25,438
Is wrong address.

224
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,746
Now, look, <i>signore,</i>
for me, it is very late night.

225
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,617
Wife. I have three <i>bambino,</i>
three <i>bambino.</i>

226
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:33,349
You know <i>bambino?</i>

227
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:38,423
My taxi go home.
I go home, too. Together.

228
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,429
Via Margutta 51.

229
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:42,523
Via Margutta 51.

230
00:22:57,214 --> 00:22:58,841
Here is Via Margutta 51.

231
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:01,510
I am very happy.

232
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,551
1,000 lira.

233
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,932
One, two, three, four <i>mille.</i>

234
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:22,097
Okay.

235
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,868
For me?

236
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,809
Okay, okay. Now, look.

237
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:30,837
- Take a little bit of that...
- Yeah?

238
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:33,582
Take her wherever she wants to go.

239
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,320
Good night.

240
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:48,094
- No, no, no, no.
- All right, look.

241
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:49,996
As soon as she wakes up, see,

242
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,035
she'll tell you
where she wants to go, okay?

243
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:54,428
My taxi is not for sleep.

244
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:58,031
My taxi. No sleep.
Understand? You understand?

245
00:23:58,108 --> 00:24:00,906
Look, pal. This is not my problem, see?

246
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:04,109
I never see her before. Okay.

247
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,911
Is not your problem. Is not my problem.

248
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:10,710
What you want?
You don't want girl, yeah?

249
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:12,721
Me don't want girl.

250
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:16,248
Police! Maybe she want girl.

251
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,821
Okay, okay, okay.

252
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:05,731
So happy... So happy...

253
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:30,832
I ought to have my head examined.

254
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,369
Is this the elevator?

255
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:39,231
It's my room.

256
00:25:41,845 --> 00:25:46,578
I'm terribly sorry to mention it,
but the dizziness is getting worse.

257
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:49,812
Can I sleep here?

258
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:52,522
That's the general idea.

259
00:25:52,956 --> 00:25:57,393
Can I have a silk nightgown
with rosebuds on it?

260
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,631
I'm afraid you'll have to
rough it tonight, in these.

261
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:05,765
Pyjamas!

262
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:09,294
Sorry, honey, but I haven't
worn a nightgown in years.

263
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:14,275
Will you help me
get undressed, please?

264
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,276
Okay.

265
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:37,361
There you are. You can handle the rest.

266
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:50,639
May I have some?

267
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:54,007
No.

268
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:56,175
Now, look...

269
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:58,187
This is very unusual.

270
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:01,515
I've never been alone
with a man before,

271
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:03,491
even with my dress on.

272
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:07,794
With my dress off, it's most unusual.

273
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,596
I don't seem to mind.

274
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:13,996
Do you?

275
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:19,137
I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.

276
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,902
You'd better get to sleep.

277
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,574
No. On this one.

278
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:26,876
So terribly nice.

279
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,947
These are pyjamas. They're to sleep in.

280
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:36,359
You're to climb into them.
You understand?

281
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,415
Thank you.

282
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:40,395
And you do your sleeping
on the couch, see, not on the bed.

283
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,863
Not on the chair, on the couch.
Is that clear?

284
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,662
Do you know my favourite poem?

285
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,531
You've already recited that for me.

286
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:51,063
"Arethusa arose
From her couch of snows

287
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:54,406
"In the Acroceraunian mountains."

288
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,538
- Keats.
- Shelley.

289
00:27:57,047 --> 00:28:00,107
You just keep your mind
off the poetry and on the pyjamas.

290
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:01,172
Everything'll be all right, see?

291
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:02,616
- It's Keats.
- Now, I'll be...

292
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:05,746
It's Shelley.
I'll be back in about 10 minutes.

293
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:07,016
Keats.

294
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:18,159
You have my permission to withdraw.

295
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:21,065
Thank you very much.

296
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:30,406
- Well?
- No trace, Your Excellency.

297
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,777
Have you searched the grounds?

298
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:34,009
Every inch, sir,
from the attics to the cellar.

299
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:36,814
I must put you on your honour
not to speak of this to anyone.

300
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:41,220
I must remind you that the princess
is the direct heir to the throne.

301
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:44,886
This must be classified as
top crisis secret.

302
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:46,292
- Have I your pledge?
- Yes, sir.

303
00:28:46,363 --> 00:28:47,694
Very well.

304
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,794
Now we must notify Their Majesties.

305
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:13,949
Oh.

306
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:16,882
So happy.

307
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:19,284
The pleasure's mine.

308
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,424
Screwball.

309
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:13,532
Holy smoke! The princess interview.

310
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:16,804
11:45.

311
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:04,756
Hi, Joe.

312
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:07,586
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hello, honey.

313
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:14,063
Mr. Hennessy has been looking for you.

314
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:20,637
Thanks a lot, hon.

315
00:32:22,312 --> 00:32:23,540
Come in!

316
00:32:31,054 --> 00:32:32,282
You've been looking for me?

317
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:33,686
Just coming to work?

318
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,053
Who, me?

319
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,684
We start our days at 8:30 in this office.

320
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,784
We pick up our assignments...

321
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:41,023
I picked mine up last night.

322
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:44,889
- What assignment was that?
- The princess. 11:45.

323
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:50,465
You've already been to the interview?

324
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,440
Sure. I just got back.

325
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,612
- Well, well, well, all my apologies.
- It's all right.

326
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,614
- This is very interesting.
- No, just routine.

327
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:02,173
Tell me, tell me, did she answer
all the questions on the list?

328
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:05,779
Well, of course she did.
I've got them right here somewhere.

329
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:08,722
Don't disturb yourself.
I have a copy here.

330
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:13,385
How did Her Highness react to the idea
of a European federation?

331
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,360
She thought it was just fine.

332
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:18,028
She did?

333
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:22,330
Well, she thought that
there'd be two effects.

334
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:23,394
Two?

335
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:26,442
The direct and the indirect.

336
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:27,999
Remarkable.

337
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:33,515
Naturally, she thought that the indirect
would not be as direct as the direct.

338
00:33:34,817 --> 00:33:37,115
- That is, not right away.
- No, no, no, no.

339
00:33:37,186 --> 00:33:39,916
Later on, of course, well, nobody knows.

340
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:45,584
Well, well, well,
that was a shrewd observation.

341
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:48,894
They fool you, you know,
these royal kids.

342
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:51,763
They've got a lot more
on the ball than we suspect.

343
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:55,964
How did she feel about
the future friendship of nations?

344
00:33:57,674 --> 00:33:58,800
Youth.

345
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:02,902
She felt that the youth of the world

346
00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:07,313
must lead the way to a better world.

347
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:09,748
Original.

348
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:13,521
By the way, what was she wearing?

349
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,585
You mean, what did she have on?

350
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,992
That's usually what it means.

351
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:22,088
What's the matter?
Is it a little warm in here for you?

352
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,826
No, no.
I just hurried over here, that's all.

353
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,596
Naturally, with a story
of these dimensions.

354
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:29,035
Did you say she was wearing grey?

355
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,367
No, I didn't say that.

356
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,930
Well, she usually wears grey.

357
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:35,239
Well, it was a kind of a grey.

358
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:38,375
I think I know the dress you mean.
It has a gold collar.

359
00:34:38,448 --> 00:34:39,938
That's the one. That's the one, yeah.

360
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,177
I didn't know exactly
how to describe it, but that's...

361
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:44,776
I think you described it very well,

362
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:48,087
in view of the fact that Her Highness

363
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,785
was taken violently ill
at 3:00 this morning,

364
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,725
put to bed with a high fever,

365
00:34:52,795 --> 00:34:56,561
and has had all her appointments
for today cancelled in toto!

366
00:34:57,767 --> 00:34:59,428
In toto?

367
00:34:59,502 --> 00:35:02,665
Yes, Mr. Bradley, in toto.

368
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:07,272
It's certainly pretty hard to swallow.

369
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,972
In view of the fact that you just left her,
of course.

370
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,605
But here it is, Mr. Bradley,

371
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:15,173
all over the front page
of every newspaper in Rome.

372
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:18,243
All right, all right, I overslept.
It can happen to anybody.

373
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:20,846
If you only got up early enough
to read a morning paper,

374
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:22,891
you might discover little news events,

375
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,052
little items of general interest

376
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,221
that might prevent someone
in the future from getting immersed

377
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:31,198
in such a gold-plated, triple-decked,
star-spangled lie

378
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:32,962
as you have just told me.

379
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:35,368
If I were you,
I would try some other line of business,

380
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:36,632
like mattress testing.

381
00:35:36,706 --> 00:35:37,934
Is this the princess?

382
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,373
Yes, Mr. Bradley, that is the princess.

383
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:44,436
It isn't Annie Oakley, Dorothy Lamour,
or Madam Chiang Kai-Shek.

384
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:45,538
Take a good look at her.

385
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:48,106
You might be interviewing her
again someday.

386
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:49,549
Am I fired?

387
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:52,414
No, you're not fired.

388
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:55,218
When I want to fire you,
you won't have to ask.

389
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,316
You'll know you're fired!

390
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:02,387
The man's mad.

391
00:36:25,822 --> 00:36:28,222
Giovanni, it's Joe Bradley.

392
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:31,749
Now, listen carefully.
I want you to hurry up to my place

393
00:36:31,828 --> 00:36:34,820
and see if there's
somebody there asleep.

394
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:39,300
Say, Mr. Joe, I look.

395
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:41,560
You wait.

396
00:37:02,692 --> 00:37:03,681
Mr. Joe?

397
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,091
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:13,030
Giovanni, I love you. Now, listen.

399
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:14,592
Yes, Mr. Joe?

400
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,133
A gun?

401
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:19,768
No!

402
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:22,675
Yes, a gun, a knife, anything,

403
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:26,442
but nobody goes in
and nobody goes out.

404
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:28,809
Okay.

405
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:43,556
You still here?

406
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:47,102
How much would a real interview
with this dame be worth?

407
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,762
Are you referring to Her Highness?

408
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:51,272
I'm not referring to Annie Oakley,
Dorothy Lamour or...

409
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,329
How much?

410
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:54,399
What do you care?
You got about as much chance as...

411
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:56,945
I know, but if I did,
how much would it be worth?

412
00:37:57,013 --> 00:38:00,881
Just a plain talk on world conditions
might be worth 250.

413
00:38:01,884 --> 00:38:05,183
Her views on clothes, of course, would
be worth a lot more, maybe 1,000.

414
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:06,243
- Dollars?
- Dollars.

415
00:38:06,322 --> 00:38:09,257
I'm talking about
her views on everything.

416
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,929
The private and secret
longings of a princess.

417
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:16,424
Her innermost thoughts,

418
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:18,797
as revealed to
your Rome correspondent

419
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:25,603
in a private, personal,
exclusive interview.

420
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:32,742
Can't use it, huh?

421
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,479
I didn't think you'd like it.

422
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:39,852
Come here.

423
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:43,791
Love angle, too, I suppose?

424
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,520
Practically all love angle.

425
00:38:45,595 --> 00:38:47,563
With pictures.

426
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,222
Could be. How much?

427
00:38:49,298 --> 00:38:53,462
That particular story will be worth
five grand to any news service.

428
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:56,562
But tell me, Mr. Bradley,
if you are sober,

429
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,767
just how you are going to obtain
this fantastic interview.

430
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:03,369
I plan to enter her sickroom
disguised as a thermometer.

431
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:06,813
You said five grand?
I want you to shake on that.

432
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:11,646
And you realize, of course,
Her Highness is in bed today

433
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:12,710
and leaves for Athens tomorrow?

434
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:13,777
Yep.

435
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:16,825
Now, I'd like to make
a little side bet with you.

436
00:39:16,892 --> 00:39:19,725
500 says you don't
come up with the story.

437
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,229
What are you looking at that for?

438
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:29,293
I just want to see what time it is.

439
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:31,169
- Huh?
- What day it is.

440
00:39:32,508 --> 00:39:33,532
It's a deal!

441
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:35,668
Now I'd like you to shake.

442
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:42,479
Let's see, you're into me
for about 500 now.

443
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:45,679
When you lose this bet,
you'll owe me 1,000.

444
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:48,417
Why, you poor sucker,
I'll practically own you.

445
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:50,982
You have practically owned me
for a couple of years now.

446
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,357
But that's all over.

447
00:39:52,428 --> 00:39:53,690
I'm going to win that money,

448
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:57,529
and with it, I'm gonna buy me
a one-way ticket back to New York.

449
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,125
Go on, go on, I love to hear you whine.

450
00:40:00,202 --> 00:40:03,330
And when I'm back in a real newsroom,
I'll enjoy thinking about you,

451
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:05,397
sitting here
with an empty leash in your hands

452
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:07,942
and nobody to twitch for you.

453
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,171
So long, pigeon!

454
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:38,172
Hey, Joe. What you know?

455
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:42,337
Is everything okay, Giovanni?

456
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,782
Nobody she's come. Nobody she's go.

457
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:47,873
Absolutely nobody.

458
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,747
Swell. Thanks a lot.

459
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:54,888
Giovanni...

460
00:40:57,259 --> 00:40:58,988
How would you like
to make some money?

461
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:00,085
- Money?
- Yeah.

462
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:04,357
That's the stuff.
Now, look, I've got a sure thing.

463
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,231
Double your money back in two days.

464
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:08,497
Double my money?

465
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:11,131
Yeah, well, I need
a little investment capital

466
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,265
to swing the deal.

467
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:15,276
Now, if you'll just lend me a little cash...

468
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:22,416
You owing me two months' rent,

469
00:41:23,386 --> 00:41:26,014
and you want me to lend you money?

470
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:27,521
- Yeah.
- No.

471
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,885
Tomorrow you'll be sorry.

472
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:40,485
Your Highness?

473
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:43,995
Your Royal Highness?

474
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:49,998
Yes, what is it?

475
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:33,065
Dear Dr. Bonnachoven...

476
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:41,179
Sure, yes, well, you're fine. Much better.
Is there anything you want?

477
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:43,748
So many things.

478
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:46,481
- Yes? Well, tell the doctor.
- So...

479
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:48,921
Tell the good doctor everything.

480
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:52,585
I dreamt, and I dreamt.

481
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:56,324
Yes? Well, what did you dream?

482
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:03,696
I dreamt I was asleep in the street,
and a young man came.

483
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:10,177
He was tall and strong,
and he was so mean to me.

484
00:45:12,247 --> 00:45:13,475
He was?

485
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:22,646
It was wonderful.

486
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,580
Good morning.

487
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,121
Where's Dr. Bonnachoven?

488
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,498
I'm afraid I don't know anybody
by that name.

489
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:08,468
Wasn't I talking to him just now?

490
00:46:08,537 --> 00:46:09,936
Afraid not.

491
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:14,971
Have I had an accident?

492
00:46:15,878 --> 00:46:16,936
No.

493
00:46:19,048 --> 00:46:21,175
Quite safe for me to sit up?

494
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:24,050
Perfect.

495
00:46:34,863 --> 00:46:36,228
Thank you.

496
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,702
Are these yours?

497
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:56,851
Did you lose something?

498
00:46:57,753 --> 00:46:58,777
No.

499
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:06,627
Would you be so kind
as to tell me where I am?

500
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:10,821
Well, this is what
is laughingly known as my apartment.

501
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,464
Did you bring me here by force?

502
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:17,165
No, no, no. Quite the contrary.

503
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:22,274
Have I been here all night, alone?

504
00:47:22,745 --> 00:47:24,838
If you don't count me, yes.

505
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:30,451
So I've spent the night here with you?

506
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,253
Well, now, I don't know
that I'd use those words, exactly,

507
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:42,286
but from a certain angle, yes.

508
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,907
How do you do?

509
00:47:59,982 --> 00:48:01,244
How do you do?

510
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:03,944
- And you are...
- Bradley. Joe Bradley.

511
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:06,017
Delighted.

512
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:08,712
You don't know
how delighted I am to meet you.

513
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,520
You may sit down.

514
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,389
Thank you very much.

515
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:19,527
What's your name?

516
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:25,901
You may call me Anya.

517
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:28,573
Thank you, Anya.

518
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,774
Would you like a cup of coffee?

519
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:35,442
- What time is it?
- About 1:30.

520
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:38,247
1:30! I must get dressed and go!

521
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,255
Why? What's your hurry?
There's lots of time.

522
00:48:41,323 --> 00:48:45,089
No, there isn't, and I've been
quite enough trouble to you as it is.

523
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,422
Trouble?

524
00:48:47,696 --> 00:48:50,130
You're not what I'd call trouble.

525
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:52,261
I'm not?

526
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:55,860
I'll run a bath for you.

527
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:14,512
There you are.

528
00:49:56,932 --> 00:49:58,490
Here we go now.

529
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,130
There you are. That does it.

530
00:50:05,073 --> 00:50:07,507
Give me a little slack, will you?

531
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:11,872
Irving! Why don't you
answer the phone?

532
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:13,380
Look, this is Joe.

533
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:15,541
Irving, can you get over here
in about five minutes?

534
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:18,177
No, I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy.

535
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:20,045
No.

536
00:50:21,423 --> 00:50:23,755
Joe, I'm up to my ears in work.

537
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:27,762
Go and get into your next outfit,
will you, honey? The canoe.

538
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,228
What kind of a scoop, Joe?

539
00:50:29,298 --> 00:50:31,459
Look, Irving,
I can't talk over the telephone.

540
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:32,625
One word in the wrong quarter,

541
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:34,100
and this whole thing
might blow sky-high.

542
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:36,967
It's front-page stuff.
That's all I can tell you.

543
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:39,234
It might be political
or it might be a sensational scandal.

544
00:50:39,308 --> 00:50:41,742
I'm not sure which, but it's a big story.

545
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:42,834
It's got to have pictures.

546
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:46,711
But I can't come now, Joe. I'm busy...

547
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:50,218
I'm busy now, and I'm meeting
Francesca at Rocca's in a half an hour.

548
00:51:49,277 --> 00:51:50,369
Don't understand.

549
00:52:13,502 --> 00:52:15,026
There you are.

550
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:18,472
I was looking at all the people out here.

551
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,441
It must be fun to live in a place like this.

552
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,205
Yeah, it has its moments.

553
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:25,610
I can give you a running commentary
on each apartment.

554
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,045
I must go.

555
00:52:28,383 --> 00:52:30,374
I only waited to say good-bye.

556
00:52:30,452 --> 00:52:33,649
Good-bye? Why, we've only just met.

557
00:52:35,424 --> 00:52:38,518
- How about some breakfast?
- I'm sorry. I haven't time.

558
00:52:38,593 --> 00:52:42,427
It must be a pretty important date
to run off without eating.

559
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:44,122
It is.

560
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:46,793
Well, I'll go along with you,
wherever you are going.

561
00:52:46,868 --> 00:52:50,099
That's all right, thank you.
I can find the place.

562
00:52:51,973 --> 00:52:54,840
Thank you for letting me
sleep in your bed.

563
00:52:56,578 --> 00:52:59,308
That's all right. Think nothing of it.

564
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:01,281
It was very considerate of you.

565
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:04,341
You must have been awfully
uncomfortable on that couch.

566
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:06,546
No. Do it all the time!

567
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,994
- Good-bye, Mr. Bradley.
- Good-bye.

568
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,628
Go right through there
and down all the steps.

569
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:22,033
Thank you.

570
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:56,098
Well, small world.

571
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:59,663
Yes. I almost forgot.
Can you lend me some money?

572
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:04,942
Yeah, that's right.
You didn't have any last night, did you?

573
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,416
How much was it that you wanted?

574
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:14,922
Well, I don't know how much I need.
How much have you got?

575
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:19,620
Well, suppose we just split this 50-50?
Here's 1,000 lira.

576
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:22,492
1,000? Can you really spare all that?

577
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:24,761
It's about $1.50.

578
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:29,468
Well, I'll arrange for it
to be sent back to you.

579
00:54:29,538 --> 00:54:31,369
What is your address?

580
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,472
Via Margutta 51.

581
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:36,408
Via Margutta 51.

582
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:38,712
Joe Bradley.

583
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:41,311
Good-bye. Thank you.

584
00:54:55,297 --> 00:54:57,492
Double my money, eh?

585
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,033
You tell me why
double my money that way?

586
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,931
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

587
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:02,526
Yeah, tomorrow.

588
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:39,550
What a wonderful hair you have.

589
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:42,860
Just cut, thank you.

590
00:57:42,931 --> 00:57:44,228
Just cut?

591
00:57:44,766 --> 00:57:47,792
Well, then, cut so?

592
00:57:48,436 --> 00:57:49,733
Higher.

593
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:51,169
Higher?

594
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:52,297
Here?

595
00:57:52,374 --> 00:57:53,466
More.

596
00:57:55,343 --> 00:57:57,004
- Here?
- Even more.

597
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,174
Where?

598
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,447
There.

599
00:58:03,518 --> 00:58:04,712
There?

600
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,051
Are you sure, miss?

601
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:09,181
I'm quite sure, thank you.

602
00:58:13,161 --> 00:58:14,628
All off?

603
00:58:14,696 --> 00:58:15,958
All off.

604
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:18,657
Off.

605
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:30,006
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

606
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,038
Yes.

607
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:37,743
Off!

608
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:44,283
Off!

609
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:50,856
Off.

610
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:05,638
Off!

611
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,060
That's a nice little camera
you have there.

612
00:59:28,136 --> 00:59:29,467
It's nice.

613
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:34,369
You don't mind if I just
borrow it, do you?

614
00:59:34,442 --> 00:59:35,500
- Miss Weber!
- Bring it right back.

615
00:59:35,577 --> 00:59:38,068
- Just for a couple of minutes.
- No.

616
00:59:38,146 --> 00:59:41,081
Let go. It's my camera.

617
00:59:49,958 --> 00:59:52,119
You musician, maybe?

618
00:59:52,994 --> 00:59:54,393
You artist?

619
00:59:55,797 --> 00:59:57,059
Painter?

620
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:01,098
I know. You model.

621
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:03,835
Model.

622
01:00:03,905 --> 01:00:05,270
Thank you.

623
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:07,940
It's perfect.

624
01:00:08,009 --> 01:00:11,206
You be nice without long hair.

625
01:00:11,279 --> 01:00:13,804
Now is cool. Cool?

626
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:16,851
Yes. It's just what I wanted.

627
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:21,786
Now, why you not
come dancing tonight with me?

628
01:00:21,856 --> 01:00:24,290
You should see. Is so nice.

629
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:29,092
Is on a boat on the Tiber,
the river by Sant'Angelo.

630
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:31,222
Moonlight, music, romantic.

631
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:33,893
Is very, very... Very!

632
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:35,560
Please? You come?

633
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:37,195
I wish I could.

634
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:45,304
But your friend,
I not think they recognize you.

635
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:48,411
No, I don't think they will.

636
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:50,883
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

637
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:57,713
After 9:00, I will be there,
dancing on river.

638
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:59,419
Remember, Sant'Angelo.

639
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:00,825
All my friends...

640
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:04,296
If you come,
you will be most pretty of all girl.

641
01:01:08,603 --> 01:01:09,968
Thank you.

642
01:01:10,672 --> 01:01:11,969
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

643
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:14,032
Thank you.

644
01:02:40,128 --> 01:02:42,790
1,000 lira.

645
01:02:42,864 --> 01:02:44,161
No money.

646
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:49,567
I'm sorry. I've really no money.

647
01:02:53,574 --> 01:02:54,700
Look.

648
01:03:00,515 --> 01:03:01,914
I'm sorry.

649
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:37,678
Well, it's you.

650
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:39,449
Yes, Mr. Bradley.

651
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,817
Or is it?

652
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:43,715
Do you like it?

653
01:03:43,791 --> 01:03:45,759
Yeah. Very much.

654
01:03:49,797 --> 01:03:52,493
So that was
your mysterious appointment.

655
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:54,592
Mr. Bradley, I have
a confession to make.

656
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:56,000
Confession?

657
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,766
Yes. I ran away last night,

658
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:01,405
from school.

659
01:04:01,476 --> 01:04:03,068
What was the matter?

660
01:04:03,144 --> 01:04:04,975
Trouble with the teacher?

661
01:04:05,046 --> 01:04:06,206
No, nothing like that.

662
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,805
Well, you don't just run away
from school for nothing.

663
01:04:08,883 --> 01:04:11,351
I only meant it to be for an hour or two.

664
01:04:11,419 --> 01:04:14,718
They gave me something last night
to make me sleep.

665
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:16,717
I see.

666
01:04:19,794 --> 01:04:21,523
Now I'd better get a taxi and go back.

667
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:24,622
Well, look, before you do,

668
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:27,725
why don't you take
a little time for yourself?

669
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:30,195
Maybe another hour.

670
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:32,899
Live dangerously. Take the whole day.

671
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,502
I could do some of the things
I've always wanted to.

672
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:37,976
Like what?

673
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:39,478
You can't imagine.

674
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:43,313
I'd like to do just whatever I like
the whole day long.

675
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:45,875
You mean, things like
having your hair cut, eating gelato?

676
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:50,947
Yes, and I'd like to sit at a sidewalk cafe
and look in shop windows,

677
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:53,353
walk in the rain.

678
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:55,952
Have fun, and maybe some excitement.

679
01:04:57,365 --> 01:05:01,267
- Doesn't seem much to you, does it?
- It's great.

680
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,535
Tell you what.

681
01:05:03,604 --> 01:05:06,801
Why don't we do
all those things together?

682
01:05:06,874 --> 01:05:08,364
Don't you have to work?

683
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:10,842
Work? No.
Today's going to be a holiday.

684
01:05:10,912 --> 01:05:14,006
But you don't want
to do a lot of silly things.

685
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:15,173
Don't I?

686
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:18,412
First wish, one sidewalk cafe.
Coming right up.

687
01:05:18,486 --> 01:05:20,113
I know just the place. Rocca's.

688
01:05:30,298 --> 01:05:32,960
What will the people at school say
when they see your new haircut?

689
01:05:33,034 --> 01:05:34,797
They'll have a fit.

690
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:39,637
What would they say if they knew
I'd spent the night in your room?

691
01:05:39,707 --> 01:05:43,905
Well, I tell you what. You don't tell
your folks, and I won't tell mine.

692
01:05:43,978 --> 01:05:45,445
It's a pact.

693
01:05:45,513 --> 01:05:47,504
Well, what would you like to drink?

694
01:05:47,582 --> 01:05:49,277
Champagne, please.

695
01:05:54,188 --> 01:05:55,553
Champagne?

696
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,395
And cold coffee for me.

697
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,430
Must be quite a life
you have in that school.

698
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:08,798
Champagne for lunch.

699
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:10,337
Only on special occasions.

700
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:11,632
For instance?

701
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:14,004
The last time was
my father's anniversary.

702
01:06:14,075 --> 01:06:15,303
Wedding?

703
01:06:15,376 --> 01:06:20,575
No. It was the 40th anniversary
of the day he got his job.

704
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:24,648
Forty years on the job.
What do you know about that?

705
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:27,180
What does he do?

706
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:31,556
Well, mostly you might call it
public relations.

707
01:06:31,993 --> 01:06:34,052
Well, that's hard work.

708
01:06:34,128 --> 01:06:36,756
- Yes, I wouldn't care for it.
- Does he?

709
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:39,026
I've heard him complain about it.

710
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,931
Why doesn't he quit?

711
01:06:41,002 --> 01:06:45,462
Well, people in that line of work
almost never do quit,

712
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:48,474
unless it's actually unhealthy for them
to continue.

713
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:50,976
Well, here's to his health, then.

714
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:54,307
You know, that's what everybody says.

715
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,951
It's all right?

716
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:02,546
Yes, thank you.

717
01:07:03,591 --> 01:07:05,388
What is your work?

718
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:07,893
I'm in the selling game.

719
01:07:08,696 --> 01:07:10,527
Really? How interesting.

720
01:07:10,598 --> 01:07:12,293
What do you sell?

721
01:07:15,136 --> 01:07:16,330
Fertilizer.

722
01:07:16,404 --> 01:07:18,668
Chemicals. You know, chemicals.

723
01:07:18,739 --> 01:07:20,366
Stuff like that.

724
01:07:27,748 --> 01:07:30,239
Irving! Well, am I glad to see you!

725
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:32,286
Why? Did you forget your wallet?

726
01:07:32,353 --> 01:07:33,911
Pull up a chair, Irving. Sit down with us.

727
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:35,319
Aren't you going to introduce me?

728
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:39,291
Yes. This is a very good friend of mine,
Irving Radovich. Anya, Irving.

729
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:42,424
- Anya...
- Smith.

730
01:07:43,164 --> 01:07:44,290
Hiya, Smitty.

731
01:07:44,365 --> 01:07:45,627
Charmed.

732
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:51,870
Hey, anybody ever tell you
you're a dead ringer for...

733
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,403
Well, I guess I'll be going.

734
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:04,645
No, don't do anything like that, Irving.
Sit down. Join us. Join us.

735
01:08:07,788 --> 01:08:10,780
Well, just till Francesca gets here.

736
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:15,955
Tell me, Mr. Radovich, what is a ringer?

737
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,019
Waiter?

738
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:18,326
It's an American term,

739
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:23,701
and it means
anyone who has a great deal of charm.

740
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,636
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,342
Cousins.

742
01:08:34,648 --> 01:08:38,516
Mr. Bradley's just been telling me
all about his work.

743
01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:40,353
I'd like to have heard that.

744
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:41,888
What do you do?

745
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:44,823
I'm in the same racket as Joe, only I'm...

746
01:08:45,426 --> 01:08:48,327
I'm awfully sorry, Irving.

747
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,122
- What are you...
- I'm sorry.

748
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,929
Look, I can take a hint.
I'll see you around.

749
01:08:55,002 --> 01:08:56,264
Your drink's just here.

750
01:08:56,337 --> 01:08:59,864
Yeah, here's your drink right now, Irving.
Take it easy.

751
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:03,341
I'm sorry about that.
Sit down. That's a good fellow.

752
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:06,179
Have a... That's a boy.

753
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:08,542
You're...

754
01:09:09,617 --> 01:09:11,050
You're twisting my arm, you know.

755
01:09:11,118 --> 01:09:14,918
Just be a little more careful not to spill.

756
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:16,320
Spill? Who's been doing the spilling?

757
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,482
You.

758
01:09:17,725 --> 01:09:19,090
- Me?
- Yeah.

759
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:23,159
Where did you find this loony?

760
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:28,294
You're okay. Here's to you.

761
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:30,829
Here's hoping for the best.

762
01:09:31,605 --> 01:09:35,302
If it wasn't for that hair, I'd swear that...

763
01:09:39,747 --> 01:09:40,941
Thanks.

764
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:44,512
You slipped, Irving. You slipped,
you almost hurt yourself that time.

765
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:47,918
I slipped? I almost hurt myself?

766
01:09:47,988 --> 01:09:50,081
- Joe, I didn't slip!
- You've got a bad sprain there.

767
01:09:50,157 --> 01:09:51,522
Never mind I got a bad sprain, Joe.

768
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:53,457
We'd better go in here
and get it fixed up.

769
01:09:53,527 --> 01:09:55,859
- Yeah, I'd like to...
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

770
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,160
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

771
01:09:58,232 --> 01:10:00,700
- Come here, pal.
- Joe, now wait a minute.

772
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:02,793
What are you trying to do now?
Take your hands off me.

773
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,565
- Have you got your lighter?
- What's that got to do with it?

774
01:10:04,638 --> 01:10:07,004
- Have you got it?
- Yeah, but what are you trying to do?

775
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:10,009
Listen, what would you do
for five grand?

776
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:13,504
- Five grand?
- Okay, look.

777
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:15,947
She doesn't know who I am or what I do.

778
01:10:16,016 --> 01:10:18,985
Look, Irving, this is my story.
I dug it up. I've got to protect it.

779
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,782
She's really the...

780
01:10:21,155 --> 01:10:24,454
Your tintypes are gonna make
this little epic twice as valuable.

781
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:27,551
- "The princess goes slumming."
- You're in for 25% of the take.

782
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:30,324
- The take's five Gs.
- Minimum. Hennessy shook hands on it.

783
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:33,828
- That's $1,500.
- It's $1,250.

784
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:36,195
Okay. Now you shake.

785
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:38,363
Okay, now lend me 30,000.

786
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:41,738
30,000? That's 50 bucks.
Are you gonna buy the crown jewels?

787
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:43,777
She's out there now drinking
champagne that I can't pay for.

788
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:45,334
We've got to entertain her, don't we?

789
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:48,813
Joe, we can't go running around town
with a hot princess.

790
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:51,647
Do you want in on this deal
or don't you?

791
01:10:58,459 --> 01:10:59,949
This I want back Saturday.

792
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:02,359
Okay. Now where's your lighter?

793
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:04,991
Let's go to work.

794
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:14,072
Better now?

795
01:11:15,142 --> 01:11:16,837
- Your ear.
- My ear?

796
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:19,706
Yeah. Joe fixed it.

797
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:23,107
Would you care for a cigarette?

798
01:11:23,184 --> 01:11:24,617
Yes, please.

799
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:27,886
You won't believe this,
but it's my very first.

800
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,582
Your very first?

801
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:32,687
No smoking in school?

802
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:35,358
Your first cigarette.

803
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:43,769
There. The gizmo works.

804
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:48,065
Well, what's the verdict? Okay?

805
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:49,734
Nothing to it.

806
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,971
That's right. Nothing to it.

807
01:11:55,149 --> 01:11:57,777
I'll stretch my legs a little here.

808
01:11:57,851 --> 01:11:59,682
I'll pick this one up, Irving.

809
01:11:59,753 --> 01:12:01,744
Yeah. You can afford it.

810
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:07,355
Well, what shall we do next?
Shall we make out a little schedule?

811
01:12:07,428 --> 01:12:09,362
Not that word, please.

812
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:13,491
I didn't mean a work... School schedule.

813
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,263
I meant a fun schedule.

814
01:12:16,904 --> 01:12:18,667
Yes. Let's just go.

815
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:21,973
Well, how about you, Irving?
Are you ready?

816
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,337
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

817
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:28,613
Francesca!

818
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:32,018
- This is...
- Smitty.

819
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,520
She's a grand girl, Irving. Grand.

820
01:12:34,588 --> 01:12:36,351
Five grand, Irving.

821
01:12:37,324 --> 01:12:39,588
- Joe!
- Where are you going now?

822
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:43,529
Honey, I gotta work. I'll call you tonight.

823
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:25,872
Look at those men!

824
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:28,499
They were supposed
to be inconspicuous.

825
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,702
You asked for plain clothes.

826
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:18,907
Hey!

827
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:22,985
Stop! Come back here!

828
01:15:35,302 --> 01:15:38,738
- Let me take this...
- No, no. Let it go. I can do it.

829
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:19,296
Yeah.

830
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:21,671
I'm going straight from now on.

831
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,140
American News Service?
What did he mean?

832
01:17:25,946 --> 01:17:28,073
Well, you know,
you say you're with the press,

833
01:17:28,148 --> 01:17:29,809
you can get away with anything.

834
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:33,714
Going to church to get married
on a scooter, that's a hot one.

835
01:17:33,787 --> 01:17:35,721
Joe's a wonderful liar.

836
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,598
Congratulations. Congratulations.

837
01:17:59,212 --> 01:18:02,375
You don't have to look so worried.
I won't hold you to it.

838
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,246
Thank you very much.

839
01:18:04,484 --> 01:18:06,816
You don't have to be too grateful!

840
01:18:06,887 --> 01:18:08,411
Okay, I won't.

841
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:13,621
I'm a good liar, too,
aren't I, Mr. Bradley?

842
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:15,491
The best I ever met.

843
01:18:16,463 --> 01:18:18,260
Thank you very much.

844
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:19,898
Say...

845
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:22,191
Come with me.

846
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,032
The mouth of truth.

847
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:34,274
The legend is that if you're given to lying
and put your hand in there,

848
01:18:34,348 --> 01:18:36,009
it'll be bitten off.

849
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,846
What a horrid idea.

850
01:18:38,752 --> 01:18:40,549
Let's see you do it.

851
01:19:05,946 --> 01:19:07,743
Let's see you do it.

852
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,209
Sure.

853
01:19:30,637 --> 01:19:31,763
Hello.

854
01:19:31,838 --> 01:19:32,862
You beast!

855
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:35,737
It was perfectly all right!
You never hurt your hand!

856
01:19:35,809 --> 01:19:38,243
I'm sorry. It's just a joke.

857
01:19:38,311 --> 01:19:39,938
You never hurt your hand.

858
01:19:40,013 --> 01:19:42,982
I'm sorry. You okay?

859
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:44,847
- Yes.
- All right. Let's go.

860
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,215
Look out!

861
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:57,429
I'll park at the corner.

862
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:21,718
What do they mean,
all these inscriptions?

863
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,690
Well, each one represents
a wish fulfilled.

864
01:20:26,226 --> 01:20:29,320
It all started during the war when
there was an air raid right out here,

865
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:32,923
a man with his four children
was caught in the street.

866
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:35,661
They ran over against the wall
right there for shelter

867
01:20:35,736 --> 01:20:37,294
and prayed for safety.

868
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,430
Bombs fell very close,
but no one was hurt.

869
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:44,603
Later on, the man came back
and he put up the first of these tablets.

870
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:46,703
Since then, it's become
a sort of a shrine.

871
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,544
People come, and whenever
their wishes are granted,

872
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:52,744
they put up another one
of these little plaques.

873
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:55,143
Lovely story.

874
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:00,889
Read some of the inscriptions.

875
01:21:15,575 --> 01:21:17,008
Make a wish?

876
01:21:18,345 --> 01:21:19,972
Tell the doctor?

877
01:21:20,747 --> 01:21:24,308
Anyway, the chances of it being granted
are very slight.

878
01:21:26,853 --> 01:21:28,411
Well, what now?

879
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:31,282
I've heard of a wonderful place
for dancing on a boat.

880
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:33,349
You mean, the barges
down by Sant'Angelo?

881
01:21:33,426 --> 01:21:34,950
Yes, couldn't we go there tonight?

882
01:21:35,028 --> 01:21:37,189
- Why not?
- Anything you wish.

883
01:21:37,464 --> 01:21:40,160
And then at midnight,
I'll turn into a pumpkin

884
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:42,758
and drive away in my glass slipper.

885
01:21:43,103 --> 01:21:45,571
And that'll be the end of the fairy-tale.

886
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,164
Well, I guess Irving has to go now.

887
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:49,731
I do?

888
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,937
Yes, you know, that big
business development of yours

889
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:54,105
that you have to attend to?

890
01:21:54,447 --> 01:21:55,471
Oh, the development.

891
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:57,244
Yes, can't afford not to take care of that.

892
01:21:57,317 --> 01:21:59,945
Yeah. I'll see you later, Smitty.

893
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,289
- Good luck with the big development.
- Thanks.

894
01:22:28,715 --> 01:22:30,148
Two, please.

895
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:45,318
Hello.

896
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:47,753
Hello.

897
01:24:03,176 --> 01:24:05,974
Mr. Bradley,
if you don't mind my saying so,

898
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,105
I think you are a ringer.

899
01:24:08,181 --> 01:24:09,614
A what?

900
01:24:09,683 --> 01:24:10,877
Oh!

901
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:12,640
Thanks very much.

902
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,018
You've spent the whole day
doing things I've always wanted to.

903
01:24:16,089 --> 01:24:17,181
Why?

904
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:20,489
I don't know. It seemed the thing to do.

905
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,994
I've never heard of anybody so kind.

906
01:24:24,864 --> 01:24:26,957
It wasn't any trouble.

907
01:24:27,033 --> 01:24:29,501
Or so completely unselfish.

908
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,439
Let's have a drink at the bar.

909
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:45,007
There you are!

910
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:49,811
I look for you a long time.
I think maybe you not come.

911
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:52,952
Off... All off!

912
01:24:53,026 --> 01:24:55,153
It's nice without, isn't it?

913
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:56,354
Cool.

914
01:24:56,796 --> 01:24:57,854
Very, very good.

915
01:24:57,931 --> 01:24:59,694
This is Mr. Bradley.

916
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,658
I, Mario Delani.

917
01:25:02,235 --> 01:25:03,224
Old friends?

918
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:07,239
Yes. He cut my hair this afternoon.
He invited me here tonight.

919
01:25:08,641 --> 01:25:10,802
Well, what did you say the name was?

920
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:12,242
Delani. Mario Delani.

921
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:15,372
Mario Delani. I'm very glad to know you.

922
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:17,044
Me, too.

923
01:25:20,086 --> 01:25:24,489
May I enjoy myself... The pleasure...
Do you mind?

924
01:25:24,557 --> 01:25:26,081
No, no. Go right ahead.

925
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,524
Thank you.

926
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:54,149
- Did I miss anything?
- You're just in time, pal.

927
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:56,347
Who's Smitty dancing with?

928
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,186
The barber.

929
01:25:58,258 --> 01:26:01,125
Cut her hair this afternoon.
Made a date for tonight.

930
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:03,355
The princess and the barber.

931
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,999
What is it?

932
01:27:44,564 --> 01:27:45,792
August.

933
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,505
Thank you!

934
01:28:00,013 --> 01:28:01,105
Bye.

935
01:28:13,927 --> 01:28:15,554
Your Highness.

936
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,560
You'll dance quietly
towards the entrance.

937
01:28:19,632 --> 01:28:21,361
There is a car waiting.

938
01:28:21,434 --> 01:28:23,425
- No.
- Your Highness, please.

939
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:24,970
You've made a mistake.

940
01:28:26,406 --> 01:28:28,738
Let me go. Will you let me go?

941
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:32,141
Mr. Bradley! Let me go, will you?
Mr. Bradley!

942
01:28:58,805 --> 01:29:00,363
Let go!

943
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:02,735
You...

944
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,188
Hit him again, Smitty!

945
01:29:59,866 --> 01:30:02,460
- Joe, here are my car keys.
- The police. The police. Come on.

946
01:30:02,535 --> 01:30:04,765
The other side of the bridge.

947
01:31:16,008 --> 01:31:17,202
All right?

948
01:31:17,276 --> 01:31:18,368
Fine. How are you?

949
01:31:18,444 --> 01:31:19,570
Fine.

950
01:31:25,418 --> 01:31:27,784
Say, you know,
you were great back there.

951
01:31:27,854 --> 01:31:29,981
You weren't so bad yourself.

952
01:31:59,252 --> 01:32:02,847
I guess we'd better get Irving's car
and get out of here.

953
01:32:23,209 --> 01:32:25,268
<i>This is</i> The American Hour <i>from Rome,</i>

954
01:32:25,344 --> 01:32:28,279
<i>continuing our program</i>
<i>of musical selections.</i>

955
01:32:53,573 --> 01:32:54,835
Everything ruined?

956
01:32:54,907 --> 01:32:57,239
No. They'll be dry in a minute.

957
01:33:01,214 --> 01:33:02,613
Suits you.

958
01:33:02,682 --> 01:33:05,150
You should always wear my clothes.

959
01:33:05,818 --> 01:33:07,342
It seems I do.

960
01:33:12,225 --> 01:33:14,887
I thought a little wine might be good.

961
01:33:16,462 --> 01:33:18,430
Shall I cook something?

962
01:33:18,498 --> 01:33:21,524
No kitchen. Nothing to cook.
I always eat out.

963
01:33:22,401 --> 01:33:24,198
Do you like that?

964
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:26,704
Life isn't always what one likes.

965
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:29,034
Is it?

966
01:33:30,576 --> 01:33:32,476
No, it isn't.

967
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,254
- Tired?
- A little.

968
01:33:43,322 --> 01:33:44,721
You've had quite a day.

969
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:46,280
A wonderful day.

970
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:47,951
<i>This is</i> The American Hour <i>from Rome,</i>

971
01:33:48,027 --> 01:33:51,554
<i>broadcasting a special news bulletin</i>
<i>in English and Italian.</i>

972
01:33:51,631 --> 01:33:52,859
<i>Tonight, there is no further word</i>

973
01:33:52,932 --> 01:33:55,127
<i>from the bedside</i>
<i>of Princess Ann in Rome,</i>

974
01:33:55,201 --> 01:33:56,532
<i>where she was taken ill yesterday</i>

975
01:33:56,602 --> 01:33:59,628
<i>on the last leg of</i>
<i>her European goodwill tour.</i>

976
01:34:00,172 --> 01:34:03,073
<i>This has given rise to rumours</i>
<i>that her condition may be serious,</i>

977
01:34:03,142 --> 01:34:07,135
<i>which is causing alarm and anxiety</i>
<i>among the people in her country.</i>

978
01:34:10,950 --> 01:34:13,180
- The news can wait till tomorrow.
- Yes.

979
01:34:13,252 --> 01:34:15,482
May I have a little more wine?

980
01:34:19,025 --> 01:34:21,789
I'm sorry I couldn't
cook us some dinner.

981
01:34:22,495 --> 01:34:24,463
Did you learn how in school?

982
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:26,361
I'm a good cook.

983
01:34:26,432 --> 01:34:27,990
I could earn my living at it.

984
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:31,059
I can sew, too,
and clean a house and iron.

985
01:34:31,137 --> 01:34:32,161
I learned to do all those things.

986
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:36,538
I just haven't had the chance
to do it for anyone.

987
01:34:40,913 --> 01:34:43,541
Well, it looks like I'll have to move

988
01:34:45,184 --> 01:34:47,846
and get myself a place with a kitchen.

989
01:34:52,825 --> 01:34:53,917
Yes.

990
01:35:19,585 --> 01:35:22,019
I shall have to go now.

991
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:39,298
Anya...

992
01:35:41,507 --> 01:35:45,466
There's something
that I want to tell you.

993
01:35:49,482 --> 01:35:50,881
No, please.

994
01:35:52,151 --> 01:35:53,413
Nothing.

995
01:36:07,466 --> 01:36:09,525
I must go and get dressed.

996
01:36:49,909 --> 01:36:52,343
Stop at the next corner, please.

997
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:53,537
Okay.

998
01:37:10,763 --> 01:37:11,889
Here?

999
01:37:13,365 --> 01:37:14,457
Yes.

1000
01:37:23,509 --> 01:37:25,500
I have to leave you now.

1001
01:37:32,017 --> 01:37:36,078
I'm going to that corner there and turn.

1002
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:40,720
You must stay in the car
and drive away.

1003
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:44,963
Promise not to watch me
go beyond the corner.

1004
01:37:46,565 --> 01:37:49,261
Just drive away and leave me,

1005
01:37:51,303 --> 01:37:52,861
as I leave you.

1006
01:37:59,645 --> 01:38:01,010
All right.

1007
01:38:03,649 --> 01:38:06,083
I don't know how to say good-bye.

1008
01:38:09,488 --> 01:38:11,615
I can't think of any words.

1009
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,525
Don't try.

1010
01:40:08,674 --> 01:40:15,170
Your Royal Highness,
24 hours, they can't all be blank.

1011
01:40:17,983 --> 01:40:19,473
They are not.

1012
01:40:20,953 --> 01:40:24,389
But what explanation
am I to offer Their Majesties?

1013
01:40:24,456 --> 01:40:27,516
I was indisposed. I am better.

1014
01:40:30,229 --> 01:40:35,166
Ma'am, you must appreciate
that I have my duty to perform,

1015
01:40:35,234 --> 01:40:38,465
just as Your Royal Highness
has her duty.

1016
01:40:38,537 --> 01:40:42,166
Your Excellency,
I trust you will not find it necessary

1017
01:40:42,241 --> 01:40:44,141
to use that word again.

1018
01:40:44,944 --> 01:40:50,405
Were I not completely aware
of my duty to my family and my country,

1019
01:40:50,482 --> 01:40:53,007
I would not have come back tonight,

1020
01:40:58,924 --> 01:41:00,858
or, indeed, ever again.

1021
01:41:08,567 --> 01:41:14,028
And now, since I understand
we have a very full schedule today,

1022
01:41:15,774 --> 01:41:18,299
you have my permission to withdraw.

1023
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,691
No milk and crackers.

1024
01:41:44,503 --> 01:41:47,631
That will be all, thank you, Countess.

1025
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,327
Is it true? Did you really get it?

1026
01:42:50,402 --> 01:42:51,664
Did I get what?

1027
01:42:51,737 --> 01:42:54,763
The princess story. The exclusive.
Did you get it?

1028
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,034
No, no, I didn't get it.

1029
01:42:56,108 --> 01:42:57,905
What? But that's impossible.

1030
01:42:57,976 --> 01:42:59,341
Have a cup of coffee or something?

1031
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:01,709
- Joe, you can't hold out on me.
- Who's holding out on you?

1032
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:02,838
- You are.
- What are you talking about?

1033
01:43:02,915 --> 01:43:04,177
I know too much.

1034
01:43:04,249 --> 01:43:05,443
First you come into my office

1035
01:43:05,517 --> 01:43:07,382
and ask about
an exclusive on the princess.

1036
01:43:07,453 --> 01:43:08,920
Next, you disappear.

1037
01:43:08,987 --> 01:43:11,421
Then I get the rumour from
my contact at the embassy

1038
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:13,515
that the princess isn't sick at all
and she's out on the town.

1039
01:43:13,592 --> 01:43:14,991
What kind of a newspaperman are you?

1040
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:17,324
You believe every two-bit rumour
that comes your way?

1041
01:43:17,396 --> 01:43:19,921
Yeah, and a lot of other rumours

1042
01:43:19,998 --> 01:43:22,296
about a shindig on a barge
down by the river

1043
01:43:22,367 --> 01:43:24,130
and the arrest of
eight Secret Service men

1044
01:43:24,203 --> 01:43:26,433
from a country which shall be nameless.

1045
01:43:26,505 --> 01:43:29,565
And then comes the news
of the lady's miraculous recovery.

1046
01:43:29,641 --> 01:43:31,165
It all adds up.

1047
01:43:31,743 --> 01:43:34,735
And don't think by playing hard to get
you'll raise the price of that story.

1048
01:43:34,813 --> 01:43:36,303
A deal's a deal.

1049
01:43:36,381 --> 01:43:39,578
Now, come on, come on,
where is that story?

1050
01:43:40,986 --> 01:43:42,613
I have no story.

1051
01:43:44,356 --> 01:43:46,790
- Then what was the idea of...
- Joe!

1052
01:43:48,627 --> 01:43:51,118
- Man, wait till you see these.
- Irving...

1053
01:43:51,196 --> 01:43:53,221
Hiya, Mr. Hennessy.
You got here at the right time.

1054
01:43:53,298 --> 01:43:55,960
- Irving...
- Wait till you get a look...

1055
01:43:57,102 --> 01:43:58,126
What's the idea?

1056
01:43:58,203 --> 01:44:00,865
What do you mean charging in here
and spilling things all over my place?

1057
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:01,997
Who's spilling?

1058
01:44:02,074 --> 01:44:03,939
You did.
I spoke to you about that once before.

1059
01:44:04,009 --> 01:44:05,738
Don't you remember?

1060
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:06,800
Joe, look at my pants.

1061
01:44:06,879 --> 01:44:08,904
Yeah, you'd better come in here
and dry them off, Irving.

1062
01:44:08,981 --> 01:44:10,608
Nuts to that.

1063
01:44:11,116 --> 01:44:12,674
- Hey, did you tell him about Smitty?
- Irving...

1064
01:44:12,751 --> 01:44:13,877
Smitty?

1065
01:44:13,952 --> 01:44:15,078
- Mr. Hennessy...
- Irving...

1066
01:44:15,154 --> 01:44:16,553
Wait till...

1067
01:44:16,788 --> 01:44:18,915
There you go again, Irving.

1068
01:44:21,793 --> 01:44:22,885
Joe.

1069
01:44:23,462 --> 01:44:25,020
- All right, save that till later.
- Listen...

1070
01:44:25,097 --> 01:44:28,760
You're here early, anyway.
Why don't you go home and shave?

1071
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:29,823
Shave?

1072
01:44:29,902 --> 01:44:33,531
Yeah, or else keep quiet till
Mr. Hennessy and I are finished talking.

1073
01:44:33,605 --> 01:44:36,165
Hey, what kind of a routine is that?

1074
01:44:36,241 --> 01:44:38,266
What are you two guys up to?
Who's Smitty?

1075
01:44:38,343 --> 01:44:40,504
He's a guy that we met.
You wouldn't care for him.

1076
01:44:40,579 --> 01:44:41,705
What am I supposed to look at?

1077
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:45,546
No, just a couple of Irving's dames.
You wouldn't like them.

1078
01:44:45,784 --> 01:44:47,183
Maybe you would.

1079
01:44:47,252 --> 01:44:50,449
Don't change the subject. When you
came back into my office yesterday...

1080
01:44:50,522 --> 01:44:52,581
Yeah, I know, yesterday at noon,
I thought I had a good lead,

1081
01:44:52,658 --> 01:44:54,148
but I was wrong.

1082
01:44:54,226 --> 01:44:57,195
That's all there is to it.
There is no story.

1083
01:44:59,932 --> 01:45:01,058
Okay.

1084
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:04,892
She's holding the press interview today.
Same time, same place.

1085
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:07,495
Maybe that's one story you can get.

1086
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:11,142
And you owe me 500 bucks!

1087
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:13,178
Take it out of my salary,
50 bucks a week.

1088
01:45:13,245 --> 01:45:15,042
Don't think I won't.

1089
01:45:18,383 --> 01:45:20,010
Hey, what gives?

1090
01:45:20,586 --> 01:45:21,644
Have we had a better offer?

1091
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:26,020
Irving, I don't know
just how to tell you this, but...

1092
01:45:27,559 --> 01:45:29,390
Wait till I sit down.

1093
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:36,499
Well, in regard to the story
that goes with these,

1094
01:45:38,437 --> 01:45:40,132
there is no story.

1095
01:45:42,074 --> 01:45:43,336
Why not?

1096
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:47,670
I mean, not as far as I'm concerned.

1097
01:45:59,725 --> 01:46:04,162
Hey, the pictures came out pretty well.
You want to have a look at them?

1098
01:46:15,707 --> 01:46:18,676
How about a blow-up
from a negative that size?

1099
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,908
- That's her first cigarette.
- Oh, yeah. At Rocca's.

1100
01:46:23,982 --> 01:46:25,973
Hey, the mouth of truth.

1101
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,079
Oh, you want to know
the caption I had in mind there?

1102
01:46:30,155 --> 01:46:31,816
"Barber cuts in."

1103
01:46:33,625 --> 01:46:37,117
Well, here's the one I figured
would be the key shot for the layout.

1104
01:46:37,195 --> 01:46:39,425
"The wall where wishes come true."

1105
01:46:39,498 --> 01:46:41,022
Joe, that's good.

1106
01:46:41,099 --> 01:46:44,398
Lead off with that,
then follow up with the wishes.

1107
01:46:45,203 --> 01:46:47,137
I dug that up out of the file.

1108
01:46:47,205 --> 01:46:49,196
"Princess inspects police."

1109
01:46:49,274 --> 01:46:50,400
Yeah.

1110
01:46:51,310 --> 01:46:53,437
"Police inspects princess."

1111
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:56,247
How about it?

1112
01:46:56,315 --> 01:46:59,284
- Joe, I got a topper for you.
- Pretty good...

1113
01:47:00,852 --> 01:47:01,876
Wow!

1114
01:47:01,953 --> 01:47:03,352
- Is that a shot?
- What a picture!

1115
01:47:03,422 --> 01:47:05,219
Is that a shot, Joe?

1116
01:47:05,724 --> 01:47:07,453
"Bodyguard gets body blow."

1117
01:47:07,526 --> 01:47:09,494
Yeah. No, how about this?

1118
01:47:09,561 --> 01:47:11,461
"Crowned head."

1119
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:14,556
I get it! That's... Joe, you got...

1120
01:47:21,139 --> 01:47:22,970
She's fair game, Joe.

1121
01:47:23,575 --> 01:47:26,237
It's always open season on princesses.

1122
01:47:28,613 --> 01:47:30,877
You must be out of your mind.

1123
01:47:30,949 --> 01:47:33,008
Yeah, I know, but...

1124
01:47:33,085 --> 01:47:37,545
Well, look, I can't prevent you from
selling the pictures if you want to.

1125
01:47:38,023 --> 01:47:40,787
- You'll get a good price for them.
- Yeah!

1126
01:47:48,066 --> 01:47:50,193
You going to the interview?

1127
01:47:50,602 --> 01:47:51,591
Are you going?

1128
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:54,230
Yeah. It's an assignment, isn't it?

1129
01:47:54,973 --> 01:47:56,099
Yeah.

1130
01:48:01,213 --> 01:48:02,703
I'll see you.

1131
01:48:18,163 --> 01:48:20,393
It ain't much, but it's home.

1132
01:48:31,276 --> 01:48:34,473
Ladies and gentlemen,
please approach.

1133
01:49:03,341 --> 01:49:05,104
Her Royal Highness.

1134
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:38,903
Your Royal Highness,
the ladies and gentlemen of the press.

1135
01:50:15,647 --> 01:50:16,978
Ladies and gentlemen,

1136
01:50:17,048 --> 01:50:20,142
Her Royal Highness will now
answer your questions.

1137
01:50:20,218 --> 01:50:22,812
I believe at the outset, Your Highness,

1138
01:50:22,888 --> 01:50:26,289
that I should express
the pleasure of all of us

1139
01:50:26,358 --> 01:50:29,191
at your recovery from the recent illness.

1140
01:50:31,596 --> 01:50:32,961
Thank you.

1141
01:50:34,132 --> 01:50:37,192
Does Your Highness believe
that federation would be

1142
01:50:37,269 --> 01:50:40,796
a possible solution
to Europe's economic problems?

1143
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:45,337
I am in favour of any measure

1144
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:48,937
which would lead to
closer cooperation in Europe.

1145
01:50:50,415 --> 01:50:53,282
And what, in the opinion
of Your Highness,

1146
01:50:53,351 --> 01:50:56,650
is the outlook for
friendship among nations?

1147
01:50:57,889 --> 01:50:59,880
I have every faith in it,

1148
01:51:02,394 --> 01:51:06,296
as I have faith in relations
between people.

1149
01:51:11,836 --> 01:51:17,433
May I say,
speaking for my own press service,

1150
01:51:17,509 --> 01:51:22,071
we believe that Your Highness's faith
will not be unjustified.

1151
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:28,344
I am so glad to hear you say it.

1152
01:51:31,356 --> 01:51:35,190
Which of the cities visited
did Your Highness enjoy the most?

1153
01:51:44,436 --> 01:51:46,336
Each in its own way...

1154
01:51:49,474 --> 01:51:53,808
Each in its own way was unforgettable.

1155
01:51:54,613 --> 01:51:56,740
It would be difficult to...

1156
01:51:59,217 --> 01:52:00,343
Rome.

1157
01:52:01,219 --> 01:52:03,687
By all means, Rome.

1158
01:52:07,058 --> 01:52:13,327
I will cherish my visit here
in memory as long as I live.

1159
01:52:20,138 --> 01:52:23,164
Despite your indisposition,
Your Highness?

1160
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:27,000
Despite that.

1161
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:30,309
Photographs may now be taken.

1162
01:52:59,344 --> 01:53:03,110
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

1163
01:53:04,315 --> 01:53:05,839
I would now like to meet

1164
01:53:05,917 --> 01:53:08,943
some of the ladies and gentlemen
of the press.

1166
01:53:28,173 --> 01:53:30,403

Irving Radovich, CR Photo Service.

1177
01:54:26,998 --> 01:54:28,522
How do you do?

1178
01:54:30,168 --> 01:54:33,228
May I present Your Highness
with some commemorative photos

1179
01:54:33,304 --> 01:54:35,204
of your visit to Rome?

1180
01:54:41,212 --> 01:54:43,146
Thank you so very much.

1182
01:54:57,295 --> 01:54:59,195
