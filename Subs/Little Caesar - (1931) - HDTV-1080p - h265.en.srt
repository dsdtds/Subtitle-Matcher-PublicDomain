1
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,130
How's that?

2
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,130
Gotta hand it to you, Rico.
The old bean's working all the time.

3
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,612
- What'll it be, gents?
- Spaghetti and coffee for two.

4
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,693
All right, sir.

5
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,861
- What's that gotta do with the price of eggs?
- Ah, plenty.

6
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,934
Diamond Pete Montana.

7
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,334
He don't have to waste his time
on cheap gas stations.

8
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,012
He's somebody. He's in the big town
doing things in a big way.

9
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,539
And look at us.
Just a couple of nobodies, nothing.

10
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,660
Is that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?

11
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,380
"Caesar Enrico Bandello.

12
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,180
Honored by his friends."

13
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,220
I could do all the things
that fella does and more.

14
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,613
Only I never got my chance.
And what's there to be afraid of?

15
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,780
When I get in a tight spot,
I shoot my way out of it. Why, sure.

16
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,137
Shoot first and argue aftervvards.

17
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,214
You know, this game
ain't for guys that's soft.

18
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,573
Yeah, there's money
in the big town, all right.

19
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,092
And the women. Good times,
something doing all the time.

20
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,491
Exciting things, you know.

21
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,015
Gee.

22
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,411
The clothes I could wear.

23
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,776
And then I'd quit, Rico.

24
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,053
I'd go back to dancing,
like I used to before I met you.

25
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,941
I don't know. I ain't made
for this sort of thing.

26
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,660
Dancing

27
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,335
That's what I wanna do.

28
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,100
Dancing?

29
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,775
Women?

30
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,774
And where do they get you?
I don't want no dancing.

31
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,217
I'm figuring on making
other people dance.

32
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,256
- Oh, I ain't forgetting about the money.
- Money's okay, but it ain't everything.

33
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,734
Be somebody. Look hard at a bunch of guys
and know they'll do anything you tell them.

34
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,655
Have your own way or nothing.
Be somebody.

35
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,774
- You'll get there, Rico.
- Yeah.

36
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,450
- You'll show them.
- You know...

37
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,251
this was our last stand
in this burg. We're pulling out.

38
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,261
- Where are we going?
- East.

39
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,980
Where things break big.

40
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,094
So I beat it east, like I told you.

41
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,332
That's all there is to it.

42
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,301
I wanna run with your mob,
if you'll let me. What do you say?

43
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,457
You won't be sorry for letting me in. I'll do
anything you say. I ain't afraid of nothing.

44
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,180
You think you're a hard guy?

45
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,334
There's nothing soft about me.
Nothing yellow. I don't quit.

46
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,495
- You got an idea you're good, huh?
- Give me a chance to show you.

47
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,858
- What do you know about me?
- Oh, I heard plenty.

48
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,172
How you run things this end of town.

49
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,812
About this here Club Palermo,
how it's your front. I got told enough.

50
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,338
- I guess you're good with a rod too, huh?
- Quick with it and sure.

51
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,411
Well, that don't go around here.
That's old stuff. This ain't the sticks.

52
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,012
Yeah, I get you.

53
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,901
All right. You stick around.

54
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,372
But, remember, I'm the boss.
And I give all the orders.

55
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,057
And when we split, we split my way.

56
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,659
- And no squawks. You get me?
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.

57
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,259
- All right, come on in, meet the boys.
- Sure.

58
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,656
Oh, they're 100 percent, all right.
Every one of them.

59
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,340
There's Tony Passa. Can drive
a car better than any mug in the town.

60
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,899
Otero. He's little,
but he's the goods, all right.

61
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,893
Bat Carilla.

62
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,654
Killer Peppi.

63
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,539
Kid Bean.

64
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,059
And this one here, Scabby.
What a smart guy he is.

65
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,500
Boys.

66
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,414
Come on, Tony. Wake up.

67
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,860
I want you to meet a new guy
what's gonna be with us.

68
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,620
This is, uh...

69
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,661
_Uh_
- Caesar Enrico Bandello.

70
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,773
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?

71
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,097
Yeah, sure.

72
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,770
Where did you get
the new dancer, DeVoss?

73
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,292
Olga brought him around
a few days ago.

74
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,214
Not bad.

75
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,092
- All right.
- I'll say he is.

76
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,816
Well, I got hold of a real dancer
for a partner, didn't I, Mr. Devoss?

77
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,454
He's an elegant dancer.
We'll panic them after a few rehearsals.

78
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,819
Say, you're not trying to sell him
to me, are you, Olga? Ha-ha-ha.

79
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,019
Well, young fella, I guess
100 a week ought to buy you.

80
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,377
That's more than I generally start with.

81
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,818
That's swell with me, even though
it don't buy no limousines.

82
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,656
Gee, thanks, Mr. Devoss.
You'll never be sorry for this.

83
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,494
Come, Joey.

84
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,017
So it's you and me from now on.

85
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,857
Well, I'm glad.

86
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,331
And I'm not ashamed to tell you.

87
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,094
I guess you know by this time
how I feel about you.

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,298
That's all right with you, isn't it?

89
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,296
Or have you got another girl?
A steady, I mean.

90
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,731
RAUGHS]

91
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,541
Hundreds of them, sure. Only...

92
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,614
Only, what's the difference?

93
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,534
This is gonna be real.

94
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,218
- We'll make it mean something.
- Yeah, Joey, let's.

95
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,852
Because I need somebody.
Somebody like you.

96
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,899
Awful bad.

97
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,537
- You believe me, Olga?
- I want to believe you.

98
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,094
What's that?

99
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,216
What you got there, Joe?

100
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,858
What are you doing with that?

101
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,898
Can't you forget you've seen it?

102
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,732
It won't make no difference.
Not between us, Olga.

103
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,138
Heh-heh, don't worry, baby.

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,453
It's just a little good-luck charm
I carry around with me.

105
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,419
Is that your racket?

106
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,460
Maybe.

107
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,059
I suppose I got no right to ask you, Joe.

108
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,094
But now...

109
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,697
Now that we got an understanding.

110
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,615
Couldn't you leave it?

111
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,975
No.

112
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,781
I suppose I haven't got the right.

113
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,930
What would be the good
of you asking, kid?

114
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,092
Once in a gang...

115
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,421
- You know the rest.
- I don't want to know.

116
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,301
Only maybe...

117
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,021
Maybe it could be different this time.

118
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,410
If we try.

119
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,614
I've never seen the guy that could
get away with it yet.

120
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,654
Black. Seven.

121
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,818
Sam Vettori is still waiting
for you in your office.

122
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,099
All right, I guess I'll have to see him.

123
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,857
I wonder what he wants here.

124
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,134
Hey, Ritz.

125
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,895
You'd better stick with me.
I'll need you in there.

126
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,499
- That Sam Vettori's a no-good lug.
- You said it, boss.

127
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,091
Better let me go first.

128
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,576
Cut that.

129
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,579
Hello, Arnie.

130
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,853
Surprised to see me
in your swell joint?

131
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,694
Maybe I won't be after you
tell me what you want here.

132
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,972
Oh, I'll tell you, all right.

133
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,213
Diamond Pete asked me to come up.
He's coming up too.

134
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,860
- Pete Montana?
- That's who.

135
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,255
Well, if Pete wants you here,
it's got to be all right with me.

136
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,221
- Hello, Mr. Montana.
- Hello.

137
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,256
Hello.

138
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,058
- Hello, Arnie.
- Hello, how are you?

139
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,258
- Hello, Vettori.
- Hello, boss.

140
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,054
Cigar?

141
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,901
Thanks.

142
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,576
Thanks, Arnie.

143
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,574
Sit down, boys.
I got something to tell you.

144
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,495
A message from the Big Boy.

145
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,654
Now, listen. Here's the lowdown.

146
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,212
- The Big Boy says—
- Just a minute, boss.

147
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,020
Hey, you.

148
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,935
Nobody asked you
to be butting in here, did they?

149
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,457
- Screw, mug.
- You ain't giving me orders.

150
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,012
- You're a fresh guy, huh?
- Take it easy, Rico.

151
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,934
You go out there and wait for me.

152
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,618
Jake with me, boss.

153
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,693
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure...

154
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,659
what's head of
the new crime commission.

155
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,735
He's putting the screws on,
and make no mistake about him.

156
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,972
Now, the Big Boy wants me
to tell you guys...

157
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,293
to put the chains on your gorillas
for the next few months.

158
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,659
Because if any of them go too far,
it'll be just too bad.

159
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,295
Ah, heh.

160
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,021
I've never seen nobody
the Big Boy couldn't get to.

161
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,970
He can fix anything.
That's why he's the Big Boy.

162
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,610
This bird McClure will be pie for him.

163
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,491
- He'll twist him around his little finger.
- Don't kid yourself.

164
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,417
Nobody's squaring nothing with McClure.
Not even the Big Boy.

165
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,652
Small jobs, that's different.

166
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,815
We could spring guys for them.
Butshoofing?

167
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,620
No, sir.

168
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,293
It's guys like this torpedo of yours
that cause all the trouble.

169
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,171
Who, Rico? Heh-heh.

170
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,052
He's all right. He's a little quick
on the trigger, but that's because he's new.

171
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,181
Yeah? Well, it's us
that'll swing for him...

172
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,857
if he shoots at the wrong time.

173
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,857
Now, remember what I told you.
Come on. So long.

174
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,460
And you.

175
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,932
You take it easy
with that cannon of yours.

176
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,733
Did you hear me?

177
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,655
Yes, Mr. Montana.

178
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,940
- Good night.
- Good night.

179
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,292
- Good night.
- Good night.

180
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,091
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?

181
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,299
Leave your gat home on the piano
the next job you pull.

182
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,374
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle.

183
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,137
Hey. Run your own mob, Arnie.
I'll take care of mine.

184
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,292
Yeah, I'll park it.

185
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,899
I don't need no cannon to take care
of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.

186
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,218
Yeah, we gotta be careful.

187
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,737
Little Arnie's interested
in this here nightclub.

188
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,298
- If it ever gets out who pulled the job—
- They'll never get wise to us.

189
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,976
They're careless,
but they've never been tapped.

190
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,292
Yeah, but I don't like the whole business.

191
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,420
Neither do I, Sam. Honest, I don't.

192
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,500
I couldn't sleep last night.
I was up worried.

193
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,291
I don't want to take any chances. Not now
the way they're closing down on us.

194
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,458
What's the matter, Tony, getting yellow?

195
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,295
No, but, jeez, none of us
wanna hang, do we?

196
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,738
You'd like to quit, wouldn't you?
You'd like to run out on us.

197
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,212
- You're yellow, you dirty—
- Wait a minute, Rico.

198
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,898
Where do you get that yellow stuff?

199
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,296
You want to know who's yellow,
I'll tell you.

200
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,135
Joe Massara, your pal.

201
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,339
- That's why he didn't show tonight.
- He'll be here. Just because—

202
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,212
I know all about that stuff. I'm gonna
give him 10 minutes more. Then we'll see.

203
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,977
Now, listen, Sam, Joe's all right.
He's the best front man in the world.

204
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,215
Why, he can go to a swell hotel
and order a suite, a suite, and it's all right.

205
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,294
Without Joe, we can't pull the job,
and you know it.

206
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,379
What's that paper?

207
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,576
It's this layout I've been
figuring out with Scabby.

208
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,653
- What, this nightclub job?
- Yeah.

209
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,211
Well, let me see it.

210
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,859
And until I say different...

211
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,338
nobody's gonna plan
for this mob but me.

212
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,492
You get me?

213
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,496
He'll learn.
Now, come here, you guys.

214
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,816
Now, get this.

215
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,214
Hello, Joe.

216
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,374
Hello, Rico.

217
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,780
Come here.

218
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,410
I told you to be here at 8:30.

219
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,731
Oh, well, you see, I—

220
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,536
I was busy.
I was rehearsing, and...

221
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,216
- Oh, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.

222
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,021
They've been saying it,
only I didn't believe them.

223
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,060
They're crazy when they call you yellow.

224
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,736
Aw. Tell them they can go to—

225
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,573
Say, what's the big idea
of the rush anyway?

226
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,415
It's a little job we need you for.

227
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,891
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.

228
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,414
What do you mean?

229
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,290
Are you trying to kid me or something?

230
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,779
How can I take the chance?
They're all my friends, they all know me.

231
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,178
That's why, they'll never suspect you.

232
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,139
Now, don't stall, Joe.

233
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,940
I ain't stalling.

234
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:22,017
You gotta get me out of this, Rico.
You gotta. I don't want to...

235
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,256
Well, don't you see,
I'm working steady now, and...

236
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,340
Can't a guy ever say he's through?

237
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,454
You're gonna be in on this,
and you'll like it.

238
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,775
The time is to be sharp midnight
on New Year's Eve.

239
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,534
I won't. I can't.

240
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,897
I can't, don't you see? I—

241
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,256
Well, gee, I—

242
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,892
- I'll be working New Year's Eve.
- Now, listen, Joe.

243
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,411
This is the joint where you're working.

244
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,141
And don't you be forgetting it, either.

245
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,974
Come on in.

246
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,132
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.

247
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,452
- Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie.
- I can.

248
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,493
Ah, you're too good, that's what.

249
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,979
Hello, Joe. You were in a big hurry
about getting here, weren't you?

250
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,857
- Maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking.
- Joe's all right. He's in with us.

251
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,500
Yeah, I'm in with you.

252
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,373
Well, let's see, now.
Here's the way I dope this thing out.

253
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:33,219
I, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico,
or nobody else.

254
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,734
- That's plain, ain't it?
- Sure.

255
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,457
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn't you?

256
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,979
Hey, I'm boss on this job, not you.
Right here.

257
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,016
Smart guy, Rico.
He's got plenty of brains.

258
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,739
I tell you, I'm afraid, Otero. I'm afraid.

259
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,860
Ah, you're crazy. Rico's coming with us.

260
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,536
Come on now, buck up. Don't be scared.

261
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,613
And you, Joe.

262
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,740
You'll be in the lobby
and give us the high sign...

263
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,212
if everything's on the up and up.
You get me?

264
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,420
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have
to take a chance with the rest of us.

265
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,175
Hey, quiet, quiet.

266
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,174
Holy Moses, it's Alvin McClure.

267
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,180
The crime commission buzzard.

268
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,056
Hey, Devoss. (Some here.

269
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,291
What is it, Arnie? What is it?

270
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,938
Bring McClure over here,
I want to buy him a lemonade.

271
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,700
- Not tonight, some other time.
- Go on. Do as you're told.

272
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,021
Go on, DeVoss, bring him here.

273
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,059
As you wish.

274
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,257
What can I order for you?

275
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,380
- Good evening, Mr. McClure.
- Good evening, DeVoss.

276
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,538
- Quite a party, eh?
- Thank you.

277
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,261
Delighted to have you with us, folks.
Heh-heh.

278
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,138
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch,
a financial backer of mine...

279
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,775
would like to meet you.

280
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,696
- May I bring him over to your table?
- Lorch? Lorch?

281
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,411
- You mean the man they call Little Arnie?
- Yes, but—

282
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,052
- You say he's a financial backer of yours?
- Yes, but—

283
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,181
I didn't understand that a man of his type
was connected with this place.

284
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,938
I'm sorry, DeVoss, but you might
inform Mr. Lorch that we're leaving.

285
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,457
I came to this place
under a misapprehension.

286
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,692
- Now, Mr. McClure—
- I'm sorry, folks...

287
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,818
but we'll have to go somewhere else.

288
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,771
You like my hair this way, Joey?

289
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,180
Sure.

290
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,659
I used to wear it—
Where are you going?

291
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,981
- Just to get a package of cigarettes.
- Hurry back, darling, it's almost 12:00

292
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,821
and I wanna be with you
for New Year's.

293
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,893
I'll be back in a minute.

294
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,059
- What can I get you?
- A Victor Noble.

295
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,731
Stay where you are.

296
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,181
Oh, help! Oh, God!

297
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,816
Open her up, Tony, this ain't no picnic.

298
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,735
What's the matter, Tony,
losing your nerve?

299
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,578
Come on, let's go. Let's go,
we gotta get out of here. Come on.

300
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,132
Happy New Year.

301
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,339
Why, Joe...

302
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,700
Joey.

303
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,780
What is it? What's the matter?

304
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,815
Nothing.

305
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,060
It's all right.

306
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,893
- The joint's been held up, that's all.
- Held up?

307
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,540
Theynn

308
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,700
- They shot McClure.
- Joe.

309
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,295
- Now you know.
- It was you.

310
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,014
- No. No, it's a lie! I—
- You shot McClure.

311
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,498
No, I didn't, I swear.
It wasn't me that shot him. It was—

312
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,932
I don't know who.

313
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,894
But it's our hips for this job, all right.

314
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,334
Maybe— Maybe everything
will be all right, Joey.

315
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,414
Maybe he wasn't hurt badly.

316
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,500
But you're through with that bunch.
You don't belong, Joe.

317
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,539
You're not that kind.

318
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,011
You'll never go near them again.

319
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,174
Olga...

320
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,612
you can't go back...

321
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,539
on a gang.

322
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,776
Well, everything come off
all right? Tell me.

323
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,299
Everything was all right.
Only I had to take care of a guy.

324
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,100
- Who was it?
- McClure.

325
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,613
McClure.

326
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,180
You shot McClure.

327
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,739
A million guys in this town, and you
had to pick the crime commissioner.

328
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,220
What did I tell you, Rico?

329
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,021
Didn't I say to make it clean?
Didn't I say no gunplay?

330
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,571
Think I'm going to let a guy
pull a gat on me?

331
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,017
Any more of these cracks,
and this is my last job.

332
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,651
The head of the crime commission.

333
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,654
The Big Boy can't do us
no good this trip.

334
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,575
They'll get us dead sure now.

335
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,576
- What am I gonna do?
- Why don't you go and give yourself up?

336
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,220
You're slipping, Sam.

337
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,737
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?

338
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,252
Getting rid of the car.
Tony got nervous. He's like a big baby

339
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,815
What a fine pickle we're in.

340
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,616
You and that rod of yours.

341
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,141
Flaherty's downstairs,
a couple of dicks with him

342
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,820
They're coming right up.

343
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,938
Stay where you are, all of you.

344
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,657
They won't know nothing unless they
picked Tony up. Give them the shaft.

345
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,898
I'll be in here listening.

346
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,500
Happy New Year, boys.

347
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,172
Say, there's a lonesome
touring car down the street.

348
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,698
I was wondering if you happened
to know anything about it.

349
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,978
How should I know anything about it?

350
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:21,135
- Ain't it got license plates on it?
- Yes, but they're phony.

351
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:24,140
It was stolen on the north side tonight.

352
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,698
Oh, I got a good café business.

353
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,535
I don't know nothing about automobiles
what's been stolen.

354
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,853
Well, you might if some of
the bright young men around here...

355
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,860
had anything to do with it,
wouldn't you?

356
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,051
- Wasn't there anybody in it?
- Yes, one guy.

357
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,771
But not when we got there. He beat it.

358
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,053
But we got a good description
of him, though.

359
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,221
I'm telling you,
I don't know nothing about it.

360
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,892
Well, come on, fellas.

361
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,294
As long as Vettori
doesn't know anything about it.

362
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,417
Oh, say, have you heard
the news, Vettori?

363
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,733
No, what?

364
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,418
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure
over at the Bronze Peacock.

365
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,218
McClure? No, that's terrible.

366
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,099
Some guys are sure careless
with the lead, all right.

367
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,900
What a tough break for Arnie.

368
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,419
It's gonna be a tough break
for a lot of birds.

369
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,421
Well, so long.

370
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,091
Oh, I forgot to wish you fellas
a merry Christmas.

371
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,731
Tony, I can't figure him.

372
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,494
The kid's a great driver.

373
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,012
- Oh, he must've lost his nerve.
- I'll take care of him.

374
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,935
- Let's see the color of that money.
- Just a minute, Sam.

375
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,492
I got my own ideas of a split.
And you can take it or leave it.

376
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,052
- We ain't begging you.
- Yeah, well, I bossed this job...

377
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,133
and I'm gonna get my split.

378
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,937
How'd you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?

379
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,094
Well, that don't go no more,
not with me. We're done.

380
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,255
- I've been taking orders from you too long.
- You'll keep on taking orders too...

381
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,256
- ... or you'll get out of here so fast...
- Maybe it won't be me that gets out.

382
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,017
No? Well, maybe the boys
have got something to say about that.

383
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,820
What about it?

384
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,737
So that's it, huh?

385
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,372
Yeah, that's it, all right.

386
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,259
You can dish it out, but you're getting so
you can't take it no more. You're through.

387
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,855
Well?

388
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,610
Well, the split's okay with me, Rico.

389
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,738
How about you boys?

390
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,021
No hard feelings, eh, Sam?

391
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,812
We gotta stick together.

392
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,531
There's a rope around my neck right now,
and they only hang you once.

393
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,176
If anybody turns yellow and squeals...

394
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,981
my gun's gonna speak its piece.

395
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,734
What's the matter, Antonio?

396
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,177
Why you don't sleep?

397
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,534
- You sick, maybe? Huh?
- Yeah.

398
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,614
- Oh, what—?
- No, can't a guy get up when he wants to...

399
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,693
without answering a lot of questions?

400
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,541
You stay out late nights,
you drink lot of wine.

401
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,137
- Leave me alone.
- Oh, listen, Antonio, I—

402
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,133
I have some spaghetti for you
on the stove.

403
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,770
If you feel better, eat some.

404
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,740
Yes? It do you good.

405
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,092
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.

406
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,617
Remember when you sing in the church?

407
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,341
In the choir with Father McNeil?

408
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,296
You in white.

409
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,139
Remember?

410
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,574
Father McNeil.

411
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,970
The church was beautiful.

412
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,213
You little boy with long hair.

413
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,896
The tall, big candles.

414
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,893
Flowers.

415
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,135
Remember, Antonio?

416
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,291
Don't leave me, Ma, do you hear?

417
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,935
You don't have to go now, do you?

418
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,218
Can't you stay a little while with me?

419
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,054
Please, don't go away.

420
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,181
- Please.
- Oh, Antonio. Oh, my baby.

421
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,901
I no go, I stay.

422
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,018
Antonio.

423
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,253
Oh, my boy.

424
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,658
I'll be all right, Ma.

425
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,090
- You'd better run along, do you hear?
- Yes.

426
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,019
You run along.

427
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,301
Take good care of yourself,
will you, huh?

428
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,773
And give my love
to Miss Manccia, will you, huh?

429
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,177
Father McNeil.

430
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,893
Hey, Tony. Where you been?
I'm looking all over for you.

431
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,099
Rico wants you to come
and get your split.

432
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,614
What's the matter, Tony?
Don't you want a split?

433
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,933
Are you crazy?

434
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,535
I'm not crazy.

435
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,852
And I don't want no split.

436
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,060
Listen, Tony.

437
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,417
Rico knows you lose your nerve

438
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,413
Now, he wants you to be a man.

439
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,538
You better not turn yellow.

440
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,977
Get away from me, Otero.
Leave me alone!

441
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,616
Listen, kid. I'm trying to tell you
for your own good.

442
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,693
- Come with me and get your split.
- Ah!

443
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,340
Hey, TOW!

444
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,219
Tony, where you going?

445
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:37,021
I'm going to see Father McNeil.

446
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,578
Rico!

447
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,653
I found Tony, but it's too late.

448
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,300
He's crazy! Crazy!

449
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,659
I tell him to be a man, but he shakes
his head and goes to the priest.

450
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:54,098
Well, I guess that's that.
We ain't got any time to lose.

451
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,093
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let's go.

452
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,332
Not me! Take— Take Scabby.

453
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,094
- Scabby's no good.
- No. I'm not.

454
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,655
- Can you drive, Otero?
- Sure!

455
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,654
All right, let's go.
We'll use the black roadster.

456
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,172
There he is.

457
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,934
Tony!

458
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,499
Did you see all them wreaths?

459
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,096
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.

460
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,294
Well, this was no time
to be tight with money.

461
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,772
Tony deserved a swell send-off.

462
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,252
- Poor kid.
- Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all.

463
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,094
It was big.

464
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,617
And all it had on it was "Tony."

465
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:02,378
- Not even Rico's name.
- Yeah. Rico's no braggart.

466
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,375
Tony looked like he was asleep.

467
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,056
Didn't look a bit changed.

468
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,372
Beats me how they do it.

469
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,692
Got a match?

470
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,574
- Look, Rico. There's Flaherty, the bull.
- Huh?

471
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,099
Aah. Hmph.

472
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,257
Things must be getting pretty hot.
What's he want?

473
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,061
He's just stalling.
They ain't got a thing on me.

474
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,941
Gee, we're moving slow.

475
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,335
We got plenty of time.
The banquet won't start until 8.

476
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,333
Yeah.

477
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,894
Too bad Tony won't be there.

478
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,615
Yeah, that's the goods, all right.
That's the fanciest I've ever seen, Sam.

479
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,455
Look at those
little turtledoves down here.

480
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,056
Friendship and loyalty, huh?

481
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:15,060
- Well, how do you like that, Sam? Huh?
- Pretty good, Rico.

482
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,054
Otero told me I don't look good
in a derby. What do you think?

483
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,974
- Looks just like you.
- I thought so.

484
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,259
I guess I'll stick to them from now on.

485
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,935
"Compliments to a true pal.

486
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,331
Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal...

487
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:30,175
Mr. Sam Vettori." Well, that's nice.

488
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,732
I appreciate, Sam. That's swell of you.

489
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,651
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey!

490
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,220
What's the matter with you birds?

491
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,657
Don't you know how to act at a banquet?

492
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,734
What do you think you are,
a lot of gashouse yaps?

493
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,456
Well, cut the chatter.

494
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,451
Scabby's gonna make a speech.

495
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,375
Well, folks...

496
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,141
you all know what we're here for...

497
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,181
so what's the good of me
telling you all about it?

498
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,055
Rico here is a great guy!

499
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,296
Sure, and, uh...

500
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,373
Well...

501
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,980
Say, Rico...

502
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,930
I don't know how to talk fancy, but...

503
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,533
This here watch is for you, see?

504
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,814
- From the boys!
- Come on, everybody. Clap, like.

505
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,130
- Speech!
- Speech!

506
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,657
Oh, no, no, no.

507
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,736
- Speech!
- Oh, well.

508
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,540
All right.

509
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,897
You birds want me to make a speech?

510
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,052
Here it goes.

511
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:23,418
L— I want to thank you, fellas,
for this here banquet.

512
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,971
It sure is swell.

513
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,458
The liquor is good, so they tell me.

514
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,251
But I don't drink it, myself.

515
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,301
And the food don't leave
nothing to be desired.

516
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,253
Well, I guess we're all
having a swell time...

517
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,210
and it sure is good to see
all you gents with your molls here.

518
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,340
Yeah.

519
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,941
Well, I...

520
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,455
I guess that's about all.

521
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,297
And I wish you birds wouldn't get
drunk and raise Cain...

522
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,612
because that's the way
a lot of birds get bumped off.

523
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,614
Yeah. Lay off that stuff.
I know what I'm—

524
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,536
A couple of newspaper guys out there want
to take a picture. What do you say, boss?

525
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,579
Well, what do you think of that, huh?
Heh.

526
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,971
Sure. Send them in.
Tell them to make it snappy.

527
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:12,973
- I'll see you later.
- Oh, don't go away.

528
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,100
- We're going to have our pictures taken.
- I haven't had my picture taken...

529
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,491
in the last 15 years.

530
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,656
Well, what do you think of that?
Fifteen years, he hasn't—

531
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,858
Come on, boys, make it snappy.

532
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,096
Come on, now! Quiet, everybody!

533
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,059
We're gonna get mugged!

534
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,140
There you are. Now, hold it.

535
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,098
Hold it, still!

536
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,891
- Look at the guys over there.
- That was a bad play you made then, Rico.

537
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,540
That flashlight.

538
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,853
- They might pick you up on that.
- Well, what do I care?

539
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,411
Don't I want folks to see
what the boys think of me?

540
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,656
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal
of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?

541
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,459
He didn't come.

542
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,101
He ain't been around in a long time.

543
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,657
He didn't quit on you, did he, Rico?

544
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,291
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.

545
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,538
One guy tried that on me once.

546
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:27,339
Now, you mind your own business
and let me tend to my own.

547
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,617
What does that bull want in here?

548
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,058
- I'll show him where he gets off.
- Careful, Rico.

549
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,012
Who invited you here?

550
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,100
You're getting up in the world,
aren't you, Rico?

551
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,256
The downstairs is open to anybody,
even cops.

552
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,775
But the upstairs is private.

553
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,852
Thanks, but I like to keep
my eye on you, Rico.

554
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,933
You see, I'm your friend.

555
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,974
I like to see a young fellow
getting up in the world...

556
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,053
that's all.

557
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,456
So long.

558
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,740
Hurry back.

559
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,741
I Will.

560
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,294
Oh, say...

561
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,176
Somebody threw a brick through
Meyer Blum's window last night.

562
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:19,300
Do you happen to know anything
about a diamond-and-platinum watch...

563
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,771
that was stolen, do you?

564
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,652
If you hear anything about it,
let me know, won't you?

565
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,291
Hm.

566
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,255
Banquet, eh?

567
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,494
Hmm.

568
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,297
Rico got far...

569
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,694
too far.

570
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,898
So now he's got to stop.

571
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,700
I'm saying he's got to stop!

572
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,820
Oh, Arnie, are you fellas
going to start another scrap?

573
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,576
What's the use of my paying
heavy dues for protection...

574
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,973
- ... if there's no peace?
- Don't worry. There'll be peace soon enough.

575
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,541
I'm saying he's got to stop,
so he's gonna stop.

576
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,852
He's been cutting in on my territory...

577
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,536
and that's all wet with me.

578
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,298
Look, ahem.

579
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,171
I'm sitting here, see?

580
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,492
I'm sitting here quiet...

581
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,130
smoking a cigarette, see?

582
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,498
But a couple of my boys
ain't sitting here.

583
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:50,701
They're out looking for Rico, and they
got their gats with them too. Catch on?

584
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:56,380
And when they find him, it won't be no
banquet that Rico gets. It will be a wake!

585
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,177
Arnie, you know best.

586
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,056
I've never met Rico.

587
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,338
Phelps, 2284.

588
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,494
Hello, Otero. This is Joe Massara.

589
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,459
I just found out something. This is hot.

590
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,898
Tell Rico to look out. Little Arnie's gang
is out to put one in him.

591
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,658
What's the matter?

592
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,821
- Where is Rico?
- You got me. He ain't showed up yet.

593
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,177
Come on, quick! We got to find him!

594
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,179
I want 10 of these.

595
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,372
Gee, you taking
all these papers, Mr. Rico?

596
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,618
Why, sure. Ain't I got
my picture in them?

597
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,894
Here.

598
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,576
- Thanks! Come again!
- That's all right.

599
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,294
Fine shots you are!

600
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,259
Oh, no!

601
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:48,450
So somebody finally put one in you.

602
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,135
Yeah, but they just grazed me.

603
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,736
The old man will be glad to hear it.

604
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,654
He takes such an interest in you.

605
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,973
Tell him the cops couldn't get me no other
way, so they hired a couple of gunmen.

606
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,053
If I wasn't on the force,
I'd have done the job cheap.

607
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,015
Did you ever think how you'd look
with a lily in your hand?

608
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,695
No, I never did.

609
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:12,412
I've been in this game a good many years,
and I put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.

610
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,494
Someday, you and I
are gonna take a ride, Rico...

611
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,574
and when we do,
I'll have the cuffs on you too.

612
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,332
No buzzard like you
will ever put any cuffs on Rico.

613
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,534
Hmph. Come on, boys.

614
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:34,973
I'm gonna get that swell-headed mug
if it's the last thing I ever do.

615
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,010
Boss, I'm sorry.
I should have been with you.

616
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,970
They thought they hit the target, boss,
but bullets just bounce off of you.

617
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,052
It was Little Arnie, Rico.
Joe Massara got the tip, and he called up.

618
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,655
We couldn't find you in time.

619
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,250
Joe, huh?

620
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,490
Well.

621
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,498
I didn't think he cared enough.

622
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,057
Well, that was white of him, all right.

623
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,611
I ought to give him a chance
on my next job.

624
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,421
There. Guess I didn't study medicine
for nothing, did I?

625
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,334
Thanks, Scabby.

626
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,212
I'm going to see Little Arnie tonight.

627
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,374
If he's looking for trouble,
why, that's what we got the most of.

628
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,773
I want Killer Peppi,
Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.

629
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,375
Hmph.

630
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,779
Listen, handsome, open up,
or you'll tell nobody nothing no more.

631
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,936
Tell him we're all right,
and don't act nervous.

632
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,333
These fellas are all right.

633
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,021
Come on, stick them up.

634
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,535
Lock that door.

635
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:07,896
Where's Arnie?

636
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,461
In the office?

637
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,056
Bat, stay outside that door
and don't let anybody in.

638
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:14,861
Kid, you keep them covered.
Peppi and Otero, follow me.

639
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,933
Come on, you. Give him the knock.

640
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,417
Over there.

641
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,856
Come on! Put them up!
Put them up! Come on!

642
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,293
Hello, Arnie.

643
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,976
- How's business?
- What's the game?

644
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,774
I don't know what this is all about,
but it's a private row.

645
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:59,901
- You guys better beat it.
- Ain't nobody gonna leave this room.

646
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,576
You guys are invited
to this private party.

647
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,698
Suppose we don't want to stay?

648
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,057
I wouldn't stop you for the world.

649
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:10,260
Only these boys
of mine have itching fingers.

650
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,974
Sit down, gents.

651
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,780
Arnie...

652
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:21,491
you ought to have better sense
than to hire a couple of outside yaps...

653
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,977
especially bad shots.

654
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,337
Come on. What is it?
Let's have it!

655
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,736
Arnie...

656
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,940
you're through.

657
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,741
You hire these mugs, they miss.
Now you're through.

658
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,052
If you ain't out of town
by tomorrow morning...

659
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:40,293
you won't ever leave it
except in a pine box.

660
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,931
I'm taking over this territory.

661
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,814
From now on, it's mine.

662
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,659
You're growing, Rico.

663
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,051
So this is what you've been after
all the time, huh?

664
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,134
I seen it in your eyes
the first time I met you.

665
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,338
You're no good, Rico.

666
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:00,779
If you think you can muscle in on me like
you did on Sam Vettori, you're off your nut!

667
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:04,218
I suppose you forgot
all about Pete Montana, huh?

668
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,780
How's Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain't mine.

669
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,898
Sam didn't feel that way about him.

670
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,371
- Sam knew who gave orders.
- Sam was too soft.

671
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,897
Diamond Pete could scare him,
but I ain't no Sam.

672
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,575
Sam is through.

673
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,051
Now you're through too.

674
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:28,297
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.

675
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,058
Nothing phony about my jewelry.

676
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,690
Arnie...

677
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,018
you better quit this racket.

678
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,213
You can dish it out, but you got
so that you can't take it no more.

679
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,892
You'd better take your hats and beat it.

680
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,771
The first thing you know, you'll be arrested
for firing a rod in the city limits.

681
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,050
Well...

682
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:03,415
I guess that's about all.

683
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,020
Oh, uh...

684
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,252
Pleasant trip, gents.

685
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:15,894
Come on, boys.

686
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,012
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery.

687
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:56,177
- Well, boys. What do you think of it?
- Scabby, you're in the wrong job. It's perfect.

688
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,618
That means you have a new partner.

689
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,972
Little Caesar.

690
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:21,098
Everybody'll laugh at Scabby's story.

691
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,821
Gee, boss. You gave Arnie
an awful walloping.

692
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,700
Rico...

693
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,171
Now you're famous.

694
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,138
You see, Otero.

695
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,692
There ain't no use in being scared
of any of these big guys.

696
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,621
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

697
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,892
Hmph. Yeah.

698
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:49,532
I ain't doing so bad
in this business so far.

699
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,179
Well, now.

700
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,253
Ah, you look great, boss.

701
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,214
Yeah, but it feels terrible.

702
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:04,539
Aw. You're getting up in the world, Rico.

703
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,899
None of us ever been invited up
to eat at the Big Boy's dump.

704
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:10,815
And nobody ever crashed the gate
except Pete Montana.

705
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,210
See what I mean?

706
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,852
Now, you don't want the Big Boy
to think you ain't got no class.

707
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,576
They rig you up better than this
in the stir.

708
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,097
If you think I'm going out
in this, you're crazy!

709
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,536
You look fine, boss.

710
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,614
- Go on. Take a peek at yourself.
- Oh, I don't know.

711
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,732
All I need is a napkin over my arm.

712
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,572
Now, don't you look fine?

713
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,974
Hm?

714
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,019
Yeah.

715
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,616
I guess maybe I don't look so bad
after all.

716
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:59,457
Oh, hello. Oh.

717
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,614
- Hello, Big Boy.
- Hello, Rico.

718
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,970
Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

719
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,812
Thanks very much.

720
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,457
Well, you're rather
lit up tonight, aren't you?

721
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:19,377
Yeah. I thought I better put on
a monkey suit.

722
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,971
That's right. You may as well learn now.

723
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,336
Yeah.

724
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,856
Well...

725
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,375
Some joint you got here.

726
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,574
It'll do.

727
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,455
Yeah.

728
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:34,500
I bet all this trick furniture
set you back plenty, huh?

729
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,540
Well, they don't exactly give it away
with cigar coupons.

730
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,772
Well, I'll tell the world. Heh.

731
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:41,500
Boy, it sure look—

732
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:42,981
Oh, look at that.

733
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,415
- Do you like it?
- Oh, I think it's elegant.

734
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,492
That cost me $15,000.

735
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,018
Fifteen thou—

736
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,494
Boy, them gold frames
sure cost plenty of dough.

737
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,534
Well, will you have a cocktail
or a dash of brandy?

738
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,897
Oh, no, thanks.
I never touch the stuff.

739
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,501
- No?
- Heh, no.

740
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,859
- Cigar, then?
- Oh, yeah. I'll have one of those.

741
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,774
Thanks.

742
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,932
Thanks very much.

743
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,375
- Sit down, Rico.
- Yeah. Thanks.

744
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,739
Mm.

745
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,457
Boy, heh-heh.

746
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,897
Now, listen, Rico.

747
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,660
I'm gonna talk to you, but you're not
gonna hear a word I say, see?

748
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:38,060
This is inside dope, and if it gets out,
it'll be just too bad for somebody.

749
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,974
You know me.

750
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,692
All right. Get this.

751
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,251
Pete Montana's through.

752
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,579
Yeah?

753
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,055
Well.

754
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:53,259
- And I thought he was such a big guy.
- He's through.

755
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,420
Suppose I were to tell you
that from now on...

756
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:00,095
you were Pete Montana.

757
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,618
That you were to take over his territory
in addition to your own.

758
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,613
Would you shake on it?

759
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:08,056
Would I?

760
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,890
Would I? Heh-heh.

761
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,537
All right. It's set.

762
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:21,097
I'm doing a lot for you, Rico,
but when I get you planted...

763
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,378
I'll expect plenty of service.

764
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,538
Well, you'll sure get it.

765
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:30,491
Permit me, then, to drink
to the new boss of the North Side.

766
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,618
Thank you. Heh.

767
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,776
Otero, what did I tell you, huh?

768
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,500
Heh-heh.

769
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,618
I knew it was coming.

770
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:07,774
I knew he had his eyes on me
all the time.

771
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:10,092
And let me tell you something, Otero.

772
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,971
It's not only Pete Montana that's through,
but the Big Boy himself.

773
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,973
He ain't what he used to be.

774
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,815
Pretty soon, he won't be
able to take it, and then...

775
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,334
watch me.

776
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:22,616
Sure, boss.

777
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,932
Pretty soon, you'll be running
the whole town.

778
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:27,337
Otero, you said a mouthful.

779
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,617
There's a guy by the name of Massara
out there. He wants to see you, sir.

780
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,061
- I'll see him in a minute.
- Yes, sir.

781
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,494
What's Joe want here?
He hasn't been near any of us for months.

782
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,135
I sent for him.

783
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:46,817
I heard somebody in Detroit got to Flaherty
and told him to start working...

784
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,578
on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock
if he wanted to find out who shot McClure.

785
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,901
Gee, boss, you're wise to everything
before it happens.

786
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,654
Yeah, I don't miss much.

787
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:01,020
I'll soon find out if Flaherty's been working
on Joe after I have a little talk with him.

788
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:21,254
Gee, Rico, what a palace.

789
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,214
Oh, hello, Joe.

790
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,853
Yeah, it'll do.

791
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,412
But what do you expect?
Ain't I got 20 grand tied up in it?

792
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,892
- Hello, Otero. How are you, baby?
- First-rate.

793
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,211
Sit down, Joe.

794
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:38,697
Sure I'm good enough to sit
in such a swell chair?

795
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,091
Come on, now. Cut the comedy.
Sit down.

796
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,734
Screw, Otero.

797
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,621
- I want to talk with Joe private.
- Sure.

798
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,613
See you later, Joe.

799
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:55,021
- Cigar, Joe?
- No, thanks.

800
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:59,412
Well, will you have a cocktail
or a dash of brandy?

801
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,901
No.

802
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,414
Well, it surprise you to hear from me?

803
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,095
Kind of.

804
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,817
I thought it would be kind of nice
to have a little talk together...

805
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,495
like old times.

806
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:13,773
Certainly is nice to see you, Rico.

807
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,659
Especially like this.

808
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:19,132
- You're looking good.
- You're looking good too, Joe.

809
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,332
Living easy, kind of, huh?

810
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:25,540
- Not that easy. Dancing's no cinch.
- Yeah, but you ain't complaining.

811
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,821
- No. No, I ain't complaining.
- That's good.

812
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,581
Yeah.

813
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:36,051
Dancing's all right for a sideline.

814
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,417
It gives you a swell front.

815
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,413
But it ain't my idea of a man's game.

816
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,101
What's the difference, Rico?

817
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:46,137
As long as I ain't kicking,
why should you kick?

818
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:47,530
Who's kicking?

819
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:52,651
Only why should a young guy
like you be wasting his time?

820
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:57,773
And I kind of took pride in you, Joe...

821
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,337
brought you into the gang,
pushed you ahead.

822
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,379
But now you're getting to be a sissy.

823
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,340
We got to go into that again?
Can't you just forget about me?

824
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:10,461
I don't want to forget, Joe. You're my pal.
We started off together, didn't we?

825
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,738
We've got to keep going along together.

826
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,813
Who else do I got to give a hang about?

827
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,455
I need you, Joe.

828
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,419
I've got the biggest chance of my life.

829
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:21,141
The Big Boyjust handed me
the whole North Side...

830
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:25,579
but it's too much for one man to handle
alone. I need somebody, a guy like you...

831
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:28,216
- ... somebody I can trust.
- Can't be me, Rico.

832
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,054
I've quit.

833
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,334
You didn't quit.

834
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,453
Nobody ever quit me.

835
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,499
You're still in my gang, you got that?

836
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,130
I don't care how many fancy skirts
you've got hanging on to you.

837
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:44,134
That jane's made a softy out of you.

838
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,015
- You lay off Olga.
- I ain't laying off. I'm after her!

839
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,817
One of us has to lose, and it won't be me.
There's ways of stopping that dame.

840
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:54,253
- You're crazy. Leave her out of this!
- She's through, out of the way.

841
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:56,697
- You're lying. You wouldn't dare!
- I wouldn't?

842
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,057
- I'll show you!
- Rico, listen.

843
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,895
We're in love with one another.
Don't that mean nothing?

844
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,620
Nothing. Less than nothing.

845
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:06,461
Love. Soft stuff!

846
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:09,136
When she's got you,
you ain't no good for anything.

847
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,576
We ain't out of this yet...

848
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,131
and we don't want no softies
spilling things!

849
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:15,577
I won't spill anything,
if you're scared of that.

850
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,574
- You think I want my neck stretched?
- Well, you know too much.

851
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,451
I ain't gonna take any chances.
You're hanging around with me, see?

852
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:24,578
No, I'm not.

853
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,020
All right.

854
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,573
You go back to that dame...

855
01:01:29,730 --> 01:01:31,653
and it's suicide.

856
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,460
Suicide for both of you.

857
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,219
Just stick here.

858
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:46,930
Hello?

859
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,252
Oh, hello, Big Boy.

860
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,780
No. No, I don't want that guy.
I don't trust him.

861
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,811
Yeah. I got a kid by the name
of Joe Massara who'll help me.

862
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,618
Yeah. All right, goodbye, Big Boy.

863
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:09,499
Oh, Joe...

864
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,974
- Joe.
- Olga.

865
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,576
- We've gotta go. Hurry!
- Joe, what's the matter?

866
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:43,017
Didn't you hear what I said?
Hurry! Hurry!

867
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:45,696
- Yes, Joe. Oh, you're ill.
- I'm all right.

868
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:48,137
- Rico.
- What did he do to you?

869
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,616
Oh, didn't I know it?

870
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,535
He, Rico—
He said you and me got to quit.

871
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:55,341
He'd kill you unless I stuck with him.
I ran away.

872
01:02:55,490 --> 01:02:59,540
We've got to get out of here.
Anywhere. As long as we get away!

873
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:01,340
No.

874
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,620
- No? You're not coming?
- No.

875
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:10,050
That's not the way.

876
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,212
But, Olga, you don't know that guy!

877
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,498
- Olga, you've got to! Please!
- No.

878
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,101
Sit down, Joe.

879
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,971
- We've got to think.
- I don't want to think or sit down.

880
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,701
- You're coming.
- Don't you see? It would be no use!

881
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,257
Where? Where would we go?
Where would we run to?

882
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,691
There's no place he wouldn't find us.

883
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,460
There's only one thing for us to do.

884
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,181
Flaherty

885
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:36,852
You're crazy.
You think that would save us?

886
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,900
Flaherty? That's worse than suicide

887
01:03:40,090 --> 01:03:42,934
- I won't do it. I can't.
- Well, I can do it.

888
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,371
That gang must go. Rico must go.

889
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,373
I want my happiness, Joe. I want you.

890
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,693
We'll never have peace till Rico's gone.
I'm going to do it.

891
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,858
Olga, don't! Please! Stay here!

892
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,570
Olga, open this door!

893
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,340
Olga, open this door! Hurry!

894
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:58,537
Park, 1000.

895
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,892
Olga. Don't call Flaherty.

896
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,940
Please open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!

897
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,741
Headquarters, I want Sergeant Flaherty.

898
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:11,859
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.

899
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,411
I've got Joe Massara with me.
In my apartment.

900
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:16,538
17 Edsel Drive.

901
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,739
Yes. Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Hurry, hurry!

902
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,291
Come on, boys,
we're going to a party.

903
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,730
Who's giving the party?

904
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,131
- Joe Massara.
- Formal or informal?

905
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:30,772
I don't know, but we'll find out
when we get there.

906
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:35,138
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have.

907
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:38,373
There was no other way.
No other right way.

908
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,939
- It's the rope for me.
- No, it isn't.

909
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,774
Not if you turn state's evidence.

910
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,092
We'll make them promise
everything will be okay.

911
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,300
Wait, Olga!

912
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,531
Joe!

913
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:00,454
There he is, the dirty double-crosser.

914
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,374
Give it to him, Rico!

915
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,420
No.

916
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:24,975
Shoot.

917
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,134
Shoot, Rico.

918
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,493
Get it over with.

919
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,493
Come on, Otero! Let's go!

920
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,015
You're getting soft too.

921
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:01,693
What's the matter with you? Come on!

922
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:02,976
Joe.

923
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:22,616
- Who was it?
- Otero! He and Rico. Through the window!

924
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,579
Go on, boys. Go and get him!

925
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,421
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?

926
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:35,733
Well, I'll talk. It was Rico's gang
that held up the Bronze Peacock.

927
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:37,455
It was Rico who shot McClure.

928
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:40,534
That dirty, low, sneaking—
Well, Joe will tell you. Ask him.

929
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,778
He knows it was Rico.

930
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,700
Is that right, Joe?

931
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:48,217
Was it Rico?

932
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:55,417
- Where's your phone?
- In there.

933
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,894
Oh, Joe. Here, let me help you.

934
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,179
Park, 1000.

935
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,212
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.

936
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,895
Round up that Palermo gang.

937
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,178
I got enough on them to use
a mile of rope.

938
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,096
Shoot the cars right out,
and above all, get Rico.

939
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,815
We've gotta watch our step.
The cops are sure to be cruising around.

940
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:30,655
- You should have plugged Joe.
- And the dame.

941
01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:33,620
If they ain't squealed about McClure yet,
they'll do it now.

942
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:35,181
- From now on, we're hot.
- Yeah.

943
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,571
This is what I get
for liking a guy too much.

944
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:38,936
Come on.

945
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:43,896
Halt!

946
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,455
Halt!

947
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,097
Go on, Rico.

948
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,139
I'm done for.

949
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,655
Go on, Rico.

950
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:34,181
Sam! Sam!

951
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:37,777
Joe Massara! They nabbed him over
the McClure business, and he squawked.

952
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:41,739
Rico tried to get him.
Now they're after him. They got Otero.

953
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,058
- Otero?
- Sam, don't you get me?

954
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,816
- What are you sitting there for?
- What else can I do?

955
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,859
I can't run now.
They'd get me anyhow.

956
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,900
You're out of your head.
Come on, get up. Let's beat it!

957
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:53,381
It's no use.

958
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,492
Put them up! Don't move!
Hand over your guns.

959
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:11,176
All right. Take them down to the car.

960
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,214
You'd better give up, Sam.

961
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:20,812
Drop that gun before we start shooting.

962
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,860
Come on in.

963
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:30,941
Get on your feet and put your hands up.

964
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:36,212
Put the cuffs on him.

965
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:41,413
You ain't got nothing on me.

966
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:43,937
Nothing but the bracelets.

967
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:48,136
And we haven't
got a thing on Rico, either.

968
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,692
He's next.

969
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,893
- There's nobody in there.
- No?

970
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:05,221
Well, listen, Ma. If you see Rico,
you'd better let us know, quick.

971
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,216
Well...

972
01:10:40,410 --> 01:10:42,378
you got yourself in a nice fix.

973
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,259
- Yeah.
- The cops were just here.

974
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,296
- They got Otero.
Uh-huh.

975
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,493
Ma, I'm gonna stay here
a day or two, then I want a car.

976
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:56,172
Gonna cost you big,
because I'm taking big chances.

977
01:10:56,330 --> 01:10:58,981
I got 10 grand planted here.
Help yourself.

978
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:01,531
When you're ready to start,
I'll give you $150.

979
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,300
You'll give me?

980
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,016
Whose money is this?
Who do you think you're talking to?

981
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,698
I need plenty. My money is hidden
in the apartment. I can't get to it.

982
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,093
I'll give you $150. Take it or leave it.

983
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:16,975
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, I'll—

984
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,660
No, you won't.

985
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,257
Because I'm the only one knows
where the money's hid.

986
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:25,659
Kill me, and you won't get a cent.

987
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:31,175
I'll give you $150...

988
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:34,015
if you'll be a good boy.

989
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:16,092
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.

990
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,776
So now he's got
what was coming to him.

991
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:20,500
What does it say in the paper?

992
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:25,179
"Former gang chief faints on scaffold.

993
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:27,215
Hmph.

994
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,890
After a futile battle in the courts...

995
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,736
Sam Vettori, former gang leader...

996
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,376
today presented a pitiful figure...

997
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,894
as the hangman's noose
was placed around his neck."

998
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:47,694
Listen. "Little Caesar
has never been found.

999
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:52,731
According to the statement of Lieutenant
Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad...

1000
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:56,616
Little Caesar, the once swaggering
braggart of the underworld...

1001
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:02,738
wilted in the face of real danger
and showed the world his cowardice.

1002
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:08,300
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar
has contradicted his oft-repeated boast...

1003
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,731
that he could dish it out
and take it too."

1004
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,096
Yeah.

1005
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,412
"When a real crisis arose...

1006
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,011
Rico couldn't take it.

1007
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:20,373
Flaherty ended his interview
by remarking:

1008
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:24,899
'Meteoric as was Rico's rise
from the gutter...

1009
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:29,021
it was inevitable
that he should return there."'

1010
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,217
Eh.

1011
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:34,341
Well, just the same,
he was the real leader of that gang.

1012
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:36,697
Don't you believe it.

1013
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:40,292
Rico didn't have the nerve,
and he didn't have the brains.

1014
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,452
He was yellow,
just like Flaherty said.

1015
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,655
Here!

1016
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:47,574
- That's what Rico—
- Give me that paper!

1017
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:49,175
Hey, watch it!

1018
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:58,492
- What's the matter with him?
- Must be crazy.

1019
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,698
I'll show them where they get off.

1020
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:18,893
Trying to put that kind of stuff
about me in the papers, huh?

1021
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,939
I'll show them— Hello?

1022
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,854
Hello? I want Park, 1000.

1023
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:26,298
Yeah. Yeah, I can't take it no more, huh?

1024
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:30,136
I'll tell that guy where to—
Hello? Park, 1000?

1025
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:34,136
- Get me Flaherty, and get him quick.
- Sure. Just a minute.

1026
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,531
Tom. Oh, Tom.

1027
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,657
I may be screwy,
but this sounds like Rico.

1028
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:41,380
Yeah?

1029
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,700
- Flaherty speaking.
- Yeah, this is Rico speaking!

1030
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:52,091
Rico! R-I-C-O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that's who!

1031
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:55,493
You're a big guy, ain't you?
Shooting your mouth off in the papers.

1032
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,938
So I ran out when it got hot, huh?
I can't take it no more?

1033
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,218
Well, listen, you crummy,
flatfooted copper...

1034
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:03,213
I'll show you whether
I lost my nerve.

1035
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,852
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.

1036
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,739
Come on, tell me some more.

1037
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:11,336
The sound of your voice
does my heart good.

1038
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:14,340
Trace that call. Find out
where he's phoning from, quick.

1039
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:15,896
Uh-huh.

1040
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:19,532
Say, why didn't you come to Sam's
neck-stretching party, Rico?

1041
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,533
It was a big success.

1042
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:25,053
Hm. Funny guy, ain't you, Flaherty?

1043
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,378
Well, you ain't got much longer to laugh.

1044
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:30,101
I'm coming, and I'm gonna put one
in your dirty hide...

1045
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,856
for every lying crack
that you made about me, see?

1046
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:35,701
I'll show you who's gonna
finish up in the gutter.

1047
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,979
We've missed you, Rico.

1048
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:40,417
The town has been nice and quiet.

1049
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,493
I'm putting on weight.

1050
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:46,974
River, 6547. It's a flophouse down
at 4th and Commercial.

1051
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,053
All right. All right, big mouth.

1052
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,895
Get your hat and star': running,
see, because you're all through.

1053
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:55,816
Call the papers and tell them that,
you rotten, dirty, lying copper!

1054
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:57,210
Hm.

1055
01:15:58,170 --> 01:16:01,538
I knew we'd hear from that guy
if I kept giving it to him in the papers.

1056
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,896
The conceit of that guy.

1057
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,691
They'll have to build a special noose
to get that swelled head of his through.

1058
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,178
Well, wish me luck.

1059
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:47,810
There he is. That's Rico, all right.
Pull in there.

1060
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,501
You'd better give up, Rico.
You haven't got a chance.

1061
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,140
You'll have to come and get me.

1062
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:01,981
You'd better be a nice boy, Rico,
and come out.

1063
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,337
You heard me!
If you want me, come and get me!

1064
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,538
I'll be with you in a minute.

1065
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,778
Give me that chopper.

1066
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,012
This is your last chance, Rico.

1067
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:17,650
Are you coming out,
or do you want to be carried out?

1068
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:42,658
Well, Rico, it looks like you and I
are going to take that little ride together.

1069
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,700
No...

1070
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,892
No, we ain't.

1071
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:53,698
I told you a little buzzard like you
will never put any cuffs on me.

1072
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:56,941
You should have come out
when I told you to, Rico.

1073
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:03,581
Mother of mercy.

1074
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:08,653
Is this the end of Rico?
