1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,750
(dramatic music)

2
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,673
(suspenseful music)

3
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:27,187
(high piercing whistling)

4
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:32,061
(dramatic music)

5
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:37,833
- Well, I guess this could
prove Professor Grogan's theory

6
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,533
that you could put a snake
to sleep with a high B flat,

7
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,993
but before any of you kids go and try it

8
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:43,613
on your neighborhood rattlers,

9
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:46,333
remember, it may only work
on snakes that like music.

10
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,023
This is Carrie Madison inviting
you to join me next week

11
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:51,823
for some more curiosities of
this weird and wacky world.

12
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:58,356
Well, I guess that wraps it up, Ronnie.

13
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:01,189
(telephone beeps)

14
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,523
Hello.

15
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:06,483
What?

16
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:08,263
No, I was just leaving.

17
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,103
I could be at professor
Hartmann's laboratory

18
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:11,853
in about two hours give or take it.

19
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:16,703
What do you mean the crew
is gonna be late, how late?

20
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,093
An hour, what am I supposed to do

21
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:19,843
with the mad scientist for an hour?

22
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:25,923
Ha, ha, ha, I'll pretend
that you didn't say that.

23
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,773
- [Announcer] This is KKZ Los Angeles,

24
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,783
the spot that's hot on your dial.

25
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,308
♪ Where you can crunch 'em ♪

26
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,771
♪ Munch 'em, chew a mean stew ♪

27
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:35,284
♪ There ain't nothing in this world ♪

28
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:39,603
♪ Like Mama Roland's Jerky Sticks ♪

29
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:42,363
Yes sir, Mama Roland's Jerky Sticks.

30
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,433
Try 'em soon, you hear?

31
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,443
There ain't nothing in this world

32
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,703
like Mama Roland's Jerky Stick.

33
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,083
Okay, it's 9:45 exactly.

34
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,733
We got a high of 75 in downtown L.A.,

35
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,303
so for you breathers
out there in the valley,

36
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,093
it's looking pretty good.

37
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,153
News and views coming at you on the hour

38
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,473
with an extended report
on those earth tremors

39
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:04,683
up Frisco way.

40
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,042
They're on their way here,

41
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,193
if they can beat the freeway traffic.

42
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:11,213
You heard it first here
where we make it happen.

43
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:13,402
It's all coming at you.

44
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,235
(radio crackling)

45
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,683
It's the first shock wave to hit the area

46
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,480
and this one reads 4.5
on the Richter scale.

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,480
This is KKZ Los Angeles news and views.

48
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,219
(road rumbling)

49
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:34,543
(tires screeching)
(horn blowing)

50
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:37,293
(truck crashing)

51
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:42,673
- Geez, what the hell
you trying to prove lady?

52
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:44,143
You wanna drive in a demolition derby

53
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,313
go do it on a track.

54
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:46,393
- Funny, very funny.

55
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,673
I suppose you didn't notice

56
00:03:47,673 --> 00:03:49,423
the rest of the world
is having an earthquake.

57
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:50,933
- You got two feet one
for the accelerator,

58
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:52,583
and one for the God damned brake.

59
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:55,703
Oh God, this piece of equipment

60
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,373
has seen me through two
state championships,

61
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:58,693
the defense of the interstate trophy,

62
00:03:58,693 --> 00:03:59,893
and cost me 40 bucks.

63
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:00,753
Now look at it.

64
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:01,586
- What is it?

65
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:02,419
- What is it?

66
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,183
It's a broken Kendo
sword, that's what it is.

67
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:05,583
- Looks like a bamboo stick.

68
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:09,043
Well, since you're all
right, I've gotta go.

69
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,323
- Hey, don't let me detain ya, lady.

70
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:11,973
I mean I'm fine, my truck is fine,

71
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:13,763
my broken Kendo stick is just fine.

72
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,733
Everything's just fine lady.

73
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:19,083
- Look, I'm sorry, uh here.

74
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,093
- [Dan] What's this?

75
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,053
- Well, it's for everything.

76
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,353
- Lady, I don't need your charity.

77
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,293
- Charity, this isn't charity,

78
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,033
and stop calling me lady.

79
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,103
I hate to be called lady.

80
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:29,363
It's insulting and patronizing.

81
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:31,193
- Believe me, I can think of better words.

82
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,373
- I bet you can.

83
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,623
It's because I'm a woman isn't?

84
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:34,456
I mean, if I were a man--

85
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:35,289
- If you were a man,

86
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,673
I'd break your God damned head.

87
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,143
- Typical, be violent.

88
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,283
- Wanna see a violent male?

89
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:40,513
If you want to be treated like a child

90
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,663
taken across my knee and
given a good spanking.

91
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:43,523
- You wouldn't dare.

92
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,473
- Try me, lady.

93
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,541
(truck hissing)

94
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:58,917
(car engine revving)

95
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:52,714
(doorbell ringing)

96
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,525
- [Carrie] Hi, I'm Carrie Madison.

97
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,733
- Yes, I recognize you, Miss
Madison, and I'm enchanted.

98
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,983
Won't you come in, please.

99
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:11,430
(engine loudly rumbling)

100
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,930
(man sighing)

101
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:30,103
I daresay you're wondering why I,

102
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,063
a serious dimensional physicist,

103
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:35,283
should waste my valuable
time on a television program

104
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:37,503
which sensationalizes science.

105
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:39,963
- Well, at least you're
brutally frank about it.

106
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,243
- I don't mean to be rude,

107
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:45,153
but your program is precisely what I need

108
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,243
to make those fools

109
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:48,833
in the halls of science
take my work seriously.

110
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,263
Sorry, I've become angry,

111
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,303
and I've become a very bad host.

112
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:57,453
Can I get you something?

113
00:06:57,453 --> 00:06:58,713
- No, thanks.

114
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:01,243
Look, I'm sorry, but my
camera crew have been delayed.

115
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:04,313
Um, maybe you could go over exactly

116
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:06,463
what it is you want us to film.

117
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:07,433
Is this it?

118
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,253
- Oh please, Miss Madison,

119
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:12,373
the matter transport is a
finely calibrated instrument.

120
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,873
- And you say you can send things

121
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,213
through this machine
into another dimension?

122
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,603
- Precisely, perhaps if I
were to show you what I mean.

123
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,406
(wires crackling)

124
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:29,948
(truck booming)

125
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:30,781
- Oh!

126
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:36,743
And they said it was gonna be a nice day.

127
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:44,983
- Now, in case you think
there's some kind of magician,

128
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:48,373
an object, some personal
possession, if I may.

129
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,181
(machine beeping)

130
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:17,074
(machine whirring)

131
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:26,823
- I saw it, but I still don't believe it.

132
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,213
- The objects are still there,

133
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,833
but in another dimension,

134
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,333
another part of the
universe we cannot see.

135
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,528
(machine beeping)

136
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:41,445
(machine whirring)

137
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:49,853
- I don't understand this.

138
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,223
(earth rumbling)

139
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:58,123
Dr. Hartmann, are you sure this is safe

140
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,648
with all these tremors going on?

141
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:04,213
- Be quiet, look, fascinating.

142
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:08,813
Do you realize we are
looking at a parallel world,

143
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:13,303
another dimension for the first time?

144
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,753
- You mean a world like ours?

145
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:16,681
- Why not?

146
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:19,453
People are people wherever they exist.

147
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,243
Perhaps technologies differ.

148
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:25,833
My God, you realize what this means?

149
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,179
The ability to cross into another world.

150
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,258
(room rumbling)

151
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,175
(machine whirring)

152
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:39,573
- Dr. Hartmann, Dr. Hartmann?

153
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,426
(mysterious music)

154
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,899
(dramatic music)

155
00:09:57,124 --> 00:10:00,041
(doorbell ringing)

156
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:06,852
(dramatic music)

157
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:07,685
- Hello, anybody home?

158
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,940
(mysterious music)

159
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:24,432
(phone clicking)

160
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:27,265
(dramatic music)

161
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:36,857
(bag thuds)
(Dan grunts)

162
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:40,363
- Oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:44,103
- Oh my God, not you again.

164
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,263
- Well look, it was
your own fault creeping

165
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,293
around like that.

166
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,462
- My fault, I come here looking
for help and I get mugged.

167
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,333
What have I done to you, lady?

168
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,553
You wipe out my truck, you
cave in my skull, you--

169
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,853
- Break your bamboo stick.

170
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,023
Kendo sword, sorry.

171
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:01,554
(Dan chuckles)

172
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:06,223
I'm Carrie, Carrie Madison.

173
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:12,473
- Dan Roebuck, keep thinking
I know you from someplace.

174
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:14,463
- I do a TV show.

175
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:16,933
- The Weird and The Wacky.

176
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:17,766
- Mm hm.

177
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,243
- Now I know ya.

178
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:23,603
Hey, that show really is a pile
of garbage, but you're good.

179
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,353
Though you look thinner on the box.

180
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,123
What is this place?

181
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,673
- It belongs to a Dr. Hartmann.

182
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,393
- Where is he?

183
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:36,573
- He's gone and I mean he's really gone.

184
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,353
- What do you mean really gone?

185
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,553
- There's no point.

186
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:40,923
I know you won't believe me.

187
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:41,756
- Try me.

188
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,353
- Well, this machine transmits things

189
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:48,253
into another world, another dimension.

190
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:50,653
(Dan chuckles)

191
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:52,303
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

192
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,303
- Of course I believe you, please go on.

193
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:57,013
- There was this accident.

194
00:11:57,013 --> 00:11:58,563
- An accident?

195
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:00,323
- And he was standing right there.

196
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:01,773
- Standing right here.

197
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:05,356
- And then all of a sudden he
just disappeared like that.

198
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,775
- (chuckles) Disappeared, just like that.

199
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:10,442
(room rumbling)

200
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,120
(machine whirring)

201
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,453
- Wait, not you!

202
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:23,048
(dramatic orchestral music)

203
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:51,833
Uh, Dr. Hartmann, Dr. Hartmann.

204
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:55,923
Oh!

205
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:57,173
Oh, oh, oh God.

206
00:12:59,042 --> 00:12:59,875
Dan, Dan Roebuck, where are you?

207
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,708
(dramatic music)

208
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:09,563
Oh Dan, can you hear me?

209
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:14,371
(dramatic music)

210
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,759
Dan, Dr. Hartmann!

211
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,303
I'll tell ya, if somebody
doesn't answer me soon.

212
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:26,594
Dr. Hartmann, I swear to God,

213
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:28,172
I have an interview later this afternoon.

214
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,681
If I miss is because of
you, I'm gonna be furious.

215
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:34,030
Damn you, damn you!

216
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,641
(dramatic music)

217
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:40,724
I must be dreaming this or I'm dead,

218
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,634
and this is either heaven or hell.

219
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:51,261
Well, heaven it isn't, so it must be hell.

220
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,475
Only this doesn't look like Dallas.

221
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:57,692
Dan Roebuck!

222
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:01,846
(Dan Roebuck echoing)

223
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,596
(wind whooshing)

224
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,155
(loudly sighing)

225
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:17,516
(Qahhar growling)
(Carrie screaming)

226
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:20,266
(dramatic music)

227
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:24,754
(Qahhar grunting)

228
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,690
(dramatic music)

229
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:40,062
(Qahhar grunting)
(dramatic music)

230
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,632
(gentle music)

231
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:04,151
(Qahhar grunting)

232
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,901
(dramatic music)

233
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,611
Son of a bitch!

234
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:36,361
(dramatic music)

235
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:42,135
(gentle music)

236
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,937
(upbeat music)

237
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,693
(tribesmen grunting)

238
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:34,663
(dramatic music)

239
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,773
- Don't panic.

240
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,273
Now slowly back away.

241
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:42,691
(dramatic music)

242
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:43,873
- Now what?

243
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:45,254
- Run like hell.

244
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,323
(tribesmen growling)

245
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,323
Keep running!

246
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,461
- [Carrie] I'm running, I'm running!

247
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,700
(dramatic music)
(tribesmen growling)

248
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,741
(Carrie screaming)

249
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:56,863
- Hang on!
(screaming)

250
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:59,414
Hang on!
(screaming)

251
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:02,614
(tribesmen growling)
(Dan grunting)

252
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:05,364
(dramatic music)

253
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,101
(tribesmen babbling)

254
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,799
(dramatic music)

255
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,218
(both groaning)

256
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:20,789
(root snapping)

257
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,539
(dramatic music)

258
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:29,283
(tribesmen growling)

259
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,116
- Oh God.

260
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,243
I think you should know
I can't stand heights,

261
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:35,473
they give me headache.

262
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:36,873
- Want a headache?

263
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:37,706
Just look up.

264
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,561
(tribesman growling)

265
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,771
- Oh!

266
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:45,349
(tribesman growling)
(body whooshing)

267
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,433
- What's going on.

268
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,199
- Maybe it's some sort of strange ritual.

269
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,906
(man grunting)
(men growling)

270
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,656
(body whooshing)

271
00:18:01,504 --> 00:18:02,453
What are you doing?

272
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:06,853
- This is the damn rope
and grappling iron.

273
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,103
I'm going to pitch it up there

274
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:10,163
and with luck it will hook onto something

275
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:12,973
and then you and I can
shimmy up the Beanstalk.

276
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,213
- And what if the giant is up there

277
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:16,293
and chops down the Beanstalk what then?

278
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:39,313
- Ladies first.

279
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:41,523
- Oh no, I don't like the way

280
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:45,223
those pint-sized midgets
committed suicide in installments.

281
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,453
Besides whatever did it
could still be up there.

282
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,286
- Okay by me.

283
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:50,523
If the wire breaks I'll have you

284
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,663
to break my fall but if
that's the way you wanna--

285
00:18:52,663 --> 00:18:56,122
- No, no, no, no on second
thought I think I'm gonna first.

286
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:58,789
(Dan chuckling)

287
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,903
- Relax, I gotcha.

288
00:19:02,903 --> 00:19:05,553
- I am quite able to do this by myself

289
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:09,373
so if you don't mind, please
take your hand off my butt.

290
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,586
Thank you.

291
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:14,336
(dramatic music)

292
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:25,000
(Carrie grunting)

293
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
(dramatic music)
(Carrie grunting)

294
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,296
It's okay now.

295
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:56,949
You can come on up.

296
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,289
(rock rumbling)
(dramatic music)

297
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,122
- Oh God!

298
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:01,872
(rock whistling)

299
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:05,128
(rock crashing)

300
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,961
(dramatic music)

301
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:14,481
- Sorry.

302
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:21,946
(Dan grunting)
(dramatic music)

303
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:36,794
Hi.

304
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:38,873
- Hey.

305
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:39,733
what are you doing?

306
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:42,303
- I'm letting him go,
that's what I'd doing.

307
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:45,823
- Oh so all of a sudden you're
an expert on this place?

308
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,253
Up to now everything in this world

309
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:49,623
either wants to hunt ya or kill ya.

310
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,553
God knows what he wants to do.

311
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,193
- I want to thank you.

312
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:54,983
- Geez, it speaks.

313
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:56,383
- Speaks English.

314
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:57,993
- No I speak Vanyan.

315
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:06,923
We can't stay here.

316
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,733
The Varns will return.

317
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,960
- The Varns?

318
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,953
- I think he means those
pint-sized midgets.

319
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,307
- What do you think?

320
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,783
- I think we'd better get out of here.

321
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:21,960
- But he's green.

322
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,710
(dramatic music)

323
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,582
(upbeat music)

324
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:40,969
(fruit popping)
(upbeat music)

325
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:55,753
- Uh thank you, thank you for helping us.

326
00:21:55,753 --> 00:21:58,523
- You saved my life
therefore I'm in your debt.

327
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:00,873
We have more forest to
cross before we're safe.

328
00:22:01,908 --> 00:22:02,948
(Carrie gasping)
(Dan groaning)

329
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:07,948
(dramatic music)
(Carrie crying)

330
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:13,472
- Hey.

331
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:16,222
(dramatic music)

332
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,110
- Hey guys!

333
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,693
(gentle music)

334
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:33,095
Whoa!

335
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,223
(gentle music)

336
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,883
(upbeat music)

337
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,793
(Carrie groaning)

338
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:55,626
Water.

339
00:22:58,213 --> 00:23:00,262
- Call me if you need me.

340
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,845
(gentle music)

341
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,224
- [Carrie] Ah!

342
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:08,807
(gentle music)

343
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,993
(Dan groans)

344
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,673
(dramatic music)

345
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:23,183
- What is that?

346
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,105
- Amber light.

347
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:27,613
How else can you make a fire?

348
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,173
- Well where I come from we use matches,

349
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:41,703
sort of like, um, (laughs)
it'll take too long to explain.

350
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,225
(dramatic music)

351
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:03,823
- You are not from Vanya

352
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,893
but there is nowhere else except Vanya.

353
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,953
Yet you speak Vanyan.

354
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:13,623
I don't understand.

355
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:16,273
- I don't understand myself.

356
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,360
(water splashing)
(Carrie screaming)

357
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,545
- Dan!

358
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:28,378
(pod gun whooshing)

359
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:31,211
(dramatic music)

360
00:24:33,643 --> 00:24:34,543
- Shit.

361
00:24:34,543 --> 00:24:35,813
What was that!

362
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:36,646
- Water beast.

363
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:39,153
Bad way to die.

364
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,226
- [Dan] You okay?

365
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:43,143
- [Carrie] Yes I'm fine, thank you.

366
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:45,263
I think I'll just put some clothes on.

367
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:46,503
- [Dan] Remember if you need any help.

368
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:47,763
- Yes, um hm, thank you.

369
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:52,173
Guess we owe you now, if
it hadn't been for that,

370
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:54,533
just what is that?

371
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:56,686
- Pod gun.

372
00:24:57,701 --> 00:25:00,843
(pod gun firing)

373
00:25:00,843 --> 00:25:03,353
- I see these, these Pods
are full of a kind of gas.

374
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:05,243
Can I have look at that?

375
00:25:05,243 --> 00:25:07,153
Okay don't pull apart.

376
00:25:07,153 --> 00:25:08,713
- My debt to you is now paid.

377
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:11,213
- Hey wait!

378
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:13,923
Hey we need your help to
find a guy named Hartmann.

379
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,613
He's the guy that got us into this mess.

380
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,513
He's the only one that can get us out.

381
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,653
- Plumberry, food for when you travel.

382
00:25:22,863 --> 00:25:25,023
- [Carrie] Hey what happened?

383
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:28,583
- He said he squared
his debt and he was off.

384
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:29,683
- Oh God.

385
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:32,918
Oh God, what is that?

386
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:34,127
(laughing)

387
00:25:34,127 --> 00:25:35,540
- Dinner.

388
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,207
(gentle music)

389
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,733
- Hartman couldn't possibly
have gotten this far, could he?

390
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,793
- Before I answer that
answer me one question.

391
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:19,626
- Huh.

392
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:22,200
- How long had you been
here before I found you?

393
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,153
- Oh about day, why?

394
00:26:25,153 --> 00:26:26,683
- Well I've been here for at least a week.

395
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:28,143
- A week.

396
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:29,713
That doesn't make any sense.

397
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,513
- I know it doesn't.

398
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:32,593
How long before you followed me

399
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:35,183
into that force field or whatever it was?

400
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,703
- A couple of seconds
I guess, I don't know.

401
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:38,133
It all happened so fast.

402
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,963
- Well, I hate to tell you
this but the way I figure it,

403
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:45,683
a split second in our world
takes a whole lot longer here.

404
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:48,749
And if Hartmann disappeared
sometime before we did,

405
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:51,683
he could have been in
this world for at least,

406
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:53,173
oh who knows maybe a year.

407
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,006
- A year!

408
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:57,360
- Well he could be anywhere.

409
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,763
- And it's a big place to
look for a kooky scientist.

410
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:01,463
- Wait.

411
00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:02,296
- What?

412
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,073
- [Carrie] I've seen that before.

413
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:07,851
- Where?

414
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:10,003
- In the lab!

415
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:13,223
When Hartman disappeared
it was behind him.

416
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:14,056
Terrific!

417
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,893
(gentle music)

418
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:21,883
You could do with the shame.

419
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:23,506
- Sorry.

420
00:27:23,506 --> 00:27:25,188
- I'm not complaining.

421
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:27,771
(gentle music)

422
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,763
(upbeat music)

423
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:28,680
(chains rattling)

424
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:33,313
(Carrie gasping)

425
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,146
- Gently.

426
00:28:35,141 --> 00:28:37,096
(dramatic music)

427
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:40,143
To find such a wildflower
lost here in the wilderness.

428
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:44,333
Especially one with hair
the color of the sun.

429
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:47,978
- No!

430
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,728
(dramatic music)

431
00:28:56,856 --> 00:29:01,733
- They didn't get far.

432
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:05,753
- You fools, did you really believe

433
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:10,753
that scum like you could
take these away from me

434
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,303
and replace me as warlord.

435
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:16,173
No one can kill Kleel.

436
00:29:17,563 --> 00:29:19,373
No one!

437
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:24,063
- I beg you, he threatened me.

438
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,733
- Oh so you were less
guilty are you coward.

439
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:29,846
Very well.

440
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:35,813
Arack, you will be taken
to the fortress with us.

441
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:43,320
As for you, hang him, now.

442
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,346
(laughing)

443
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:46,073
- No, please!

444
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:47,598
I beg you!

445
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:48,483
No!

446
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:49,853
Don't shoot me please!

447
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:56,191
(man screaming)

448
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:04,543
- Skin of ivory, hair
the color of the sun.

449
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:05,858
- Don't touch me!

450
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:06,691
(screams)

451
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:10,673
- And she speaks, when
she should remain silent.

452
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:14,653
What other surprises do you
have for me, Wildflower.

453
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:19,267
- Let her go you son of
a bitch or I'll kill ya.

454
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:22,017
(dramatic music)

455
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,074
(gun firing)

456
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,907
- No!

457
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:28,169
You killed him!

458
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:29,403
(dramatic music)

459
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:30,333
Oh you animal!

460
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,393
(hand smacking)
(Carrie groaning)

461
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:36,226
- Bring her.

462
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:39,847
(dramatic music)

463
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,134
Giddy up.

464
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,884
(dramatic music)

465
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:56,525
- Giddy up.
- Come on frig.

466
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:57,942
- Gung ho.
- Yeah!

467
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,499
(dramatic music)

468
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:05,082
(gentle music)

469
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,263
- Who's attack!

470
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:13,113
- Where's Carrie?

471
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:16,783
- Yeah, you're chokin' me you great ox.

472
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:17,843
- I'll break your goddamn neck

473
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:19,553
if you don't give me some answers.

474
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:21,343
- If we're talking about the girl,

475
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:23,053
Kleel the war lord took her.

476
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:24,413
- Where's he taking her?

477
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:25,993
- Look, don't you know anything?

478
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:28,653
Back to his fortress in the Dead Mountains

479
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,833
but no one gets in there and
I know what I'm talking about.

480
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,183
- And who the hell are you?

481
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,923
- My name is Malachi.

482
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:35,773
Can I get up now?

483
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:43,883
- Oh.
(Dan groaning)

484
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:44,716
- Here.

485
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:51,203
(Dan moaning)

486
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,733
- Can you take me there?

487
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:58,833
- First you act like a corpse
now you want to be an idiot.

488
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,933
- I wouldn't expect you do it for nothing.

489
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:03,723
- What is that?

490
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,111
Is it gold?

491
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:07,953
- It's a watch, not only gold
but it's got magical powers,

492
00:32:07,953 --> 00:32:10,163
it speaks, it warns the one who wears it

493
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,861
if a thief is about.

494
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:12,783
- The devil it does.

495
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:14,409
(watch merrily beeping)

496
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:16,413
It also tell you Pacific
time, Mountain time

497
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:18,983
and the exact hour and
minute in Hong Kong.

498
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:21,193
- By all that's smelly in my own shoe.

499
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:23,676
It's a deal,

500
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:27,493
- It's yours, once we
reach Kleel's fortress.

501
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:31,543
- First off you need a horse.

502
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,909
(upbeat music)

503
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,763
Talkin' of horses the best dealer

504
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:43,163
in these mountains is
my old friend, Treet.

505
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:44,063
Though you ought to know,

506
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:47,223
he's got the sort of charm
that would make a snake vomit

507
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:49,728
but he sells good horses.

508
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:52,311
(gentle music)

509
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:01,899
(men chattering)

510
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,763
(men laughing)

511
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,178
(dramatic music)

512
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:37,870
- Get up!

513
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,937
- No!

514
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:40,353
No!

515
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,021
No!

516
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,021
- Move!
- No!

517
00:33:45,677 --> 00:33:46,677
- Yes!
- No!

518
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:50,873
- No!
(man laughing)

519
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:52,368
- Yes!

520
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:54,293
- [Carrie] Oh God!

521
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
- No!
- Yes!

522
00:34:01,351 --> 00:34:02,951
(Carrie groaning)

523
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:05,701
(dramatic music)

524
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:15,969
- Don't you touch me.

525
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,449
- Speak when you're spoken to.

526
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:19,282
- Agh!

527
00:34:19,282 --> 00:34:20,889
(man screaming)

528
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,329
(dramatic music)

529
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,162
- You!

530
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,628
I'm gonna teach you--

531
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,860
(Qahhar grunting)

532
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,610
(man strangling)

533
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,161
(dramatic music)

534
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,448
(gun firing)

535
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:44,281
(Qahhar grunting)

536
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:51,647
(dramatic music)

537
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:56,647
(club thudding)
(man yelling)

538
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:02,833
- So you thought you'd
play the master, huh.

539
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:08,723
Don't you never try to
wear my boots again vermin.

540
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,783
This woman belongs to me.

541
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:12,943
Do you understand?

542
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:13,803
- I didn't know.

543
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,563
I swear I didn't know.

544
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:18,056
- Now you do.

545
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:32,871
(boot thudding)
(man groaning)

546
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:45,233
Had he touched you, the
skin would have been peeled

547
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,243
from his screaming flesh

548
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:51,403
because you would have been
tainted by his foul embrace.

549
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:56,223
I'd have crushed the petals
of my little wildflower.

550
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,460
(dramatic music)

551
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,460
(Qahhar grunting)
(dramatic music)

552
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:14,733
- [Dan] How far to Kleel's fortress

553
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,143
from where you pick up the horses?

554
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:17,853
- [Malachi] Oh about a day's ride

555
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:19,703
but the closer we get
to Kleel's stronghold,

556
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:21,163
the more your mind might change.

557
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:22,013
- Why?

558
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,183
- If the tales they tell are true,

559
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,493
Kleel has a mighty sorcerer in his power.

560
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:28,243
You felt the bite of
his double smoke stick.

561
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:29,763
How can you hope to beat a man

562
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:32,060
who has the dark powers on his side.

563
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,727
(upbeat music)

564
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:53,967
(Dan groaning)

565
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:55,267
- [Dan] Whew!

566
00:36:55,267 --> 00:36:57,167
- Leave the talking to me.

567
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,750
(upbeat music)

568
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,062
(men laughing)

569
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,443
- Malachi, you spitball.

570
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,553
- Spitball.

571
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:30,953
- What dugout, you been hidin' in?

572
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:33,633
- Wasn't I just tellin' my
companion how we had to stop

573
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:36,413
and wish my old friend
Treet a very merry day.

574
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:39,333
- I'll give you that,
horseman, ya you curdled toad.

575
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,163
- Curdled toad.

576
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:44,193
- Is that horseman, here
you old horse thief?

577
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:47,263
- Hand made tools the like of
which you'll never see again.

578
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:48,583
Of course my friend,

579
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,493
and food and drink is all I ask in return.

580
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:03,475
(tooth crunching)
(Treet groaning)

581
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,573
- Little offering for the fairies.

582
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:13,123
- Hey!

583
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,609
Hang on a second there, those tools--

584
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:15,442
- Yes?

585
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,773
- Are of excellent value.

586
00:38:19,623 --> 00:38:21,043
I want to word with you little man.

587
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,303
- Well I hope it's a thank you.

588
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:23,328
- What!

589
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:24,203
Do you know how much those tools cost?

590
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:26,181
You've just given away my livelihood!

591
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,023
- That's gratitude for you.

592
00:38:28,023 --> 00:38:30,783
I bring you all this way introduce you

593
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:31,913
to my friends.

594
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,093
- Him?

595
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,173
- and all I'm getting for
my pains is the promise

596
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:37,323
of that watch which would be much safer

597
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,403
in my keeping knowing the type of thief

598
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,703
that drinks in this place.

599
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,413
Do you hear me?

600
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:44,893
What is it?

601
00:38:44,893 --> 00:38:47,463
- That man at the table over there.

602
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:50,053
- That's a green man they're really weird.

603
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:51,383
The men with him are traders.

604
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:54,163
They're trying to learn how
he summons the wild horses.

605
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:55,653
That's why they're
filling him up with booze

606
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:57,353
but he won't tell them.

607
00:38:57,353 --> 00:38:58,603
Where are you off to now?

608
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:01,864
- Oh excuse me.

609
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:03,676
Hi.

610
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:04,673
- Pour him another drink.

611
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:06,543
- I could still do with your help.

612
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:07,413
- What's going on?

613
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:10,803
- Now listen friend, we're
willing to pay for your secret.

614
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:13,263
- Look, the girl I was
with, she's in deep trouble.

615
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:15,243
- Listen scat head, you're in trouble.

616
00:39:15,243 --> 00:39:17,973
I'm doing business with this
man, now you stay out of it.

617
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:19,523
- Look I only wanna quick word okay.

618
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,553
- Just what do you think you're doing?

619
00:39:21,553 --> 00:39:23,903
- Look he helped me before,
I'd like his help again, okay.

620
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,183
- I'm helping you this time

621
00:39:25,183 --> 00:39:26,983
and nobody gets to share my reward.

622
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:29,353
- The way you do business
I can't afford ya.

623
00:39:29,353 --> 00:39:30,843
- Back slidin' on our deal is it.

624
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:33,669
- Friend, I hope your
skills as thick you're hide.

625
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:36,737
(head thuds)

626
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:37,753
- What are you feeding him?

627
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:41,417
- I'm getting upset and when I get upset--

628
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,250
- Aww, shut up.

629
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,123
- I told you not to intrude!

630
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:45,943
- Hey, hey, I'm sorry I'm outta line.

631
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:47,383
I hate people who interfere.

632
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:51,563
- Look, you ought to
know that my friend here

633
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:54,873
not only said you looked like hogs in heat

634
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:57,533
but you smell like pigs in the swill bin.

635
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:59,347
- [Man in Red] He did, did he!

636
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:01,295
(dramatic music)

637
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:06,228
(fists thudding)
(dramatic music)

638
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:08,145
- [Malachi] Here ya go!

639
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:14,853
(men yelling)
(dramatic music)

640
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:33,213
- Okay, call your men back.

641
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:37,113
- All right get back to your fun now, now!

642
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:40,131
- I'm going but first
my friend comes with me.

643
00:40:40,131 --> 00:40:41,083
(dramatic music)

644
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:46,083
- This is Treet Sky, and Treet
says who goes and who stays.

645
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:47,233
- Let him have him.

646
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:49,329
He's drugged.

647
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:51,270
- He's drugged.

648
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,103
(dramatic music)

649
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,723
- Here, what about me?

650
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:15,104
- What about you, dimple.

651
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:16,914
(dramatic music)

652
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:18,529
- [Malachi] Wait!

653
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:21,944
(dramatic music)

654
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:23,183
Come back!

655
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:25,133
How much?

656
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,343
You owe me!

657
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,613
Wait, let me ride with you.

658
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,153
Kleel the warlord will
pay much for that one.

659
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:34,163
- Why?

660
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:36,245
- [Malachi] Why that's for me
to know and you to find out.

661
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:39,693
All I ask is the gold band
he wears around his wrists.

662
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:42,293
- Truly Warlord Kleel will
pay gold for that one?

663
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:45,435
So will the Nabu Fire Warriors
and they're a lot nearer.

664
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:48,663
(Malachi groaning)
(man laughing)

665
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:50,993
- [Malachi] A favor, Treet old friend.

666
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:54,273
- Oh, anything, as long as you ride

667
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:55,913
as far from here as possible.

668
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,803
- A short cut!

669
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:59,113
Is there a shortcut
through to the main trail?

670
00:41:59,113 --> 00:42:01,773
- Keep the river on your right, now go.

671
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:05,543
You evil smelling shrimp.

672
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:08,565
- May you suffocate in your
own fat you tub of grease.

673
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:12,035
(Treet laughing)

674
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,785
(dramatic music)

675
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:19,652
- [Man] Raise the gate!

676
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:24,652
(dramatic music)
(men groaning)

677
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:36,007
(dramatic music)

678
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:50,673
- Only the dead know their way out.

679
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,360
(dramatic music)

680
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:23,500
(gentle music)

681
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:38,313
Shareen, always the little mother.

682
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:42,213
- My lord.

683
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:45,093
- Bosk bring the woman.

684
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:47,906
Carefully.

685
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,373
Our Hellcat might damage
your manhood again.

686
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:53,853
Don't dismiss the men,

687
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:55,203
I want them to see what happens

688
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:56,763
to those who plot against me.

689
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:02,193
Hair the color of the sun.

690
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:04,716
What would you give

691
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:06,563
to have hair the color
of the sun, Shareen.

692
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:11,168
I should have the scalp
off your pretty head.

693
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:14,393
But then Shareen would sell her soul

694
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:18,233
to be anything other than the
half-breed slave that she is.

695
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:19,433
Isn't that true Shareen?

696
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:36,787
(men chattering)

697
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:38,636
- Haw!

698
00:44:55,813 --> 00:44:56,646
- Traitor!

699
00:44:57,973 --> 00:45:00,062
I hope the hanging of your accomplice,

700
00:45:00,062 --> 00:45:01,993
weighs heavily on your conscience.

701
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:07,643
You wanted me dead, now you have the means

702
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,503
in front of you to do it, coward.

703
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:15,893
Right here in the open
for everybody to see

704
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:20,893
that Kleel's law is just, hard but just.

705
00:45:21,108 --> 00:45:23,691
(men laughing)

706
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:27,503
Do you still have the guts coward

707
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:31,744
or is that yellow streak down
your back just for decoration.

708
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:34,494
(dramatic music)

709
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,147
(spear clangs)

710
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:46,897
(dramatic music)

711
00:46:01,603 --> 00:46:04,186
(spear clangs)

712
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,280
(dramatic music)

713
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:23,872
(spear thuds)

714
00:46:23,872 --> 00:46:25,539
You had your chance.

715
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,673
And you threw them away.

716
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,907
(dramatic music)

717
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:36,157
(laughing)

718
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:42,007
(gun fires)

719
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,840
(dramatic music)

720
00:46:56,783 --> 00:47:01,653
Kleel's law is hard, hard but just.

721
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,103
- You call that justice?

722
00:47:04,073 --> 00:47:05,173
I call it murder.

723
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:11,163
- Perhaps a few hours in
Bosk's degenerate arms

724
00:47:11,163 --> 00:47:13,363
might teach you a little respect.

725
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,973
- I don't think you'd like that.

726
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:19,406
- Oh?

727
00:47:21,493 --> 00:47:26,493
Bosk, cage her, no food no water.

728
00:47:27,368 --> 00:47:30,201
(dramatic music)

729
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:44,823
- She has the mark of
evil in her eyes, lord.

730
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,873
She will bring you ill luck if she stays.

731
00:47:47,783 --> 00:47:51,263
- No my dear if she stays
the ill luck will be yours.

732
00:47:54,646 --> 00:47:56,962
(Kleel laughing)

733
00:47:56,962 --> 00:47:58,723
- What a great trade,

734
00:47:58,723 --> 00:48:01,643
shrunken green weirdo
for an undersized thief.

735
00:48:09,578 --> 00:48:11,019
(twig snapping)

736
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:13,602
(upbeat music)

737
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:23,983
- Piddle.

738
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:26,563
- You, I thought I got rid of you.

739
00:48:26,563 --> 00:48:27,793
- Hope springs eternal.

740
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:30,983
- You're not only a thief
but an assassin as well.

741
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:32,443
- It isn't as bad as it looks.

742
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:33,276
- No?

743
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:34,353
You can explain why
you're sneakin' up on me

744
00:48:34,353 --> 00:48:36,083
with a dagger in your hand?

745
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,773
- I came to warn you.

746
00:48:37,773 --> 00:48:39,413
- Ha, ha, ha, right.

747
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:41,703
- I did and this is all the thanks I get.

748
00:48:41,703 --> 00:48:44,423
- I don't believe this, I
just don't believe this.

749
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:47,153
- I don't suppose you'd believe me

750
00:48:47,153 --> 00:48:48,933
if I tell you there's someone behind you.

751
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:50,166
- Oh, come on.

752
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,916
(sword thunking)

753
00:48:55,092 --> 00:48:57,675
(upbeat music)

754
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,912
(dramatic music)

755
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,813
- Where are we?

756
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:15,183
- Don't ask, just don't ask.

757
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:16,873
- We're being sold to the Nabu

758
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:19,783
who worshiped that rock
of fire over there.

759
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:20,793
We're in great danger.

760
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:22,943
- Keep your opinions
to yourself you drunk.

761
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:26,643
- Well my friend it's your lucky day.

762
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:29,663
The Nabu honor you.

763
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:32,613
They invite you to a contest
with the Guardian of the Rock.

764
00:49:33,742 --> 00:49:36,903
If you win, you and your
friends are free to go.

765
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:38,933
- No problem, start the contest.

766
00:49:38,933 --> 00:49:40,293
- Hey hold on a goddamn minute.

767
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:42,303
What the hell am I getting myself into.

768
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:45,493
- Ah, and if you refuse their invitation,

769
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:48,633
they pull out your tongues by the roots,

770
00:49:48,633 --> 00:49:53,023
boil them and then while
you watch, eat them.

771
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,763
- Er, that's disgusting.

772
00:49:54,763 --> 00:49:58,113
- And finally you're given
to the God of a Rock.

773
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,615
(rock hissing)

774
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,513
(laughing)

775
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:06,579
And then you fry.

776
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,829
(laughing)

777
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:11,561
It's fun isn't it.

778
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:14,023
(Dan grunting)

779
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:15,123
You never learn do ya.

780
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:18,743
what do I tell them?

781
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:20,786
Do you accept?

782
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:23,713
- Nod your head you idiot.

783
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,133
- Ah shoot.

784
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:31,413
(laughing)

785
00:50:31,413 --> 00:50:33,841
- He desires the contest.

786
00:50:33,841 --> 00:50:35,653
- [Nabu] Hurrah!

787
00:50:41,907 --> 00:50:44,490
(Dan grunting)

788
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,673
- Thanks a lot you little twit.

789
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,754
(upbeat music)

790
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:56,223
(dramatic music)

791
00:50:57,734 --> 00:51:00,493
(laughing)

792
00:51:00,493 --> 00:51:01,779
- Oh God.

793
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:04,612
(dramatic music)

794
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:14,790
Okay.

795
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,343
(dramatic music)

796
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:19,473
Just a minute.

797
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:26,371
(upbeat music)

798
00:51:29,813 --> 00:51:31,260
Oh, God!

799
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,397
(dramatic music)

800
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:36,931
(fists thudding)

801
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:38,751
(dramatic music)

802
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:39,923
(foot thudding)

803
00:51:39,923 --> 00:51:40,756
Ow!

804
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:50,041
(fists thudding)
(Dan grunting)

805
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:57,433
(laughing)

806
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:03,732
(fists thudding)
(dramatic music)

807
00:52:08,932 --> 00:52:09,765
Ah?

808
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:11,015
- Go on, go on!

809
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,482
(dramatic music)

810
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:16,677
(fists thudding)

811
00:52:16,677 --> 00:52:20,070
(arms smashing)
(Dan groaning)

812
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,669
(dramatic music)

813
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:23,190
(boot clanking)

814
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,023
- Holy shit!

815
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,246
(sword clanging)

816
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:28,079
(boot stomping)

817
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,141
(Guardian screaming)

(Malachi laughing)

820
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,666
(Nabu moaning)

821
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:44,113
- Hey, hey, I won, you guys, I won!

822
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:49,923
- Sorcerer, all I hear
from you are excuses.

823
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:54,503
I need more powder for my guns

824
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:58,223
and you swore to show me
an even greater power.

825
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:02,283
- [Sorcerer] Your Excellency,
the slaves are not getting

826
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:04,153
sufficient chemicals out of the mines

827
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:05,713
for me to purify and distill.

828
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:09,653
Get me enough and I'll show
you what real power is.

829
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:11,593
- Then we will drive them night and day

830
00:53:11,593 --> 00:53:15,273
but Sorcerer do not disappoint me.

831
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:17,283
I tire of waiting.

832
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:21,046
Bosk!

833
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,023
- Say nothing I beg of you.

834
00:53:29,023 --> 00:53:30,373
I'll find a way to see you.

835
00:53:33,173 --> 00:53:35,349
- Drive the slaves even harder,

836
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:39,107
the work goes too slow
and bring the woman in.

837
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:41,940
(dramatic music)

838
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:52,457
Your meat.

839
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:55,290
(dramatic music)

840
00:53:59,283 --> 00:54:01,003
Eat damn you!

841
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:04,263
(door knocking)

842
00:54:04,263 --> 00:54:05,096
Come!

843
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:13,153
You see I am not the
barbarian you think I am.

844
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:17,393
Plenty of fine food, bath and, uh,

845
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:21,073
look frock of exquisite thread.

846
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,384
(dramatic music)

847
00:54:29,651 --> 00:54:31,053
The water cools.

848
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:31,886
Bathe now.

849
00:54:31,886 --> 00:54:33,233
- What do you take me for?

850
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:36,563
- Why do you defy me.

851
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:42,253
Do you enjoy making me angry?

852
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:46,973
Because only the very stupid have no fear.

853
00:54:46,973 --> 00:54:47,813
- I am afraid.

854
00:54:49,963 --> 00:54:53,103
- Oh, well then well fight me.

855
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:55,623
I mean you're very strange.

856
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:58,283
Unlike any in this land.

857
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:03,293
But you're the first woman
who could rule by my side.

858
00:55:04,873 --> 00:55:06,143
- Go to hell.

859
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:07,207
(dramatic music)

860
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:08,257
- Do not threaten me!

861
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:11,683
Your life hangs by a thread!

862
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:18,593
I could take you any time I wish you.

863
00:55:18,593 --> 00:55:19,426
You understand?

864
00:55:20,935 --> 00:55:23,643
(dramatic music)

865
00:55:23,643 --> 00:55:28,473
You will stay in the cage
without any food or water

866
00:55:29,623 --> 00:55:33,533
until you crawl to me
on your hands and knees

867
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:36,918
and beg me to take you.

868
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:38,845
(Carrie groaning)

869
00:55:38,845 --> 00:55:39,678
(dramatic music)

870
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:40,901
- No!

871
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:42,915
(fist thuds)

872
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:45,259
(dramatic music)

873
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:50,259
(Shareen screaming)
(monkey screeching)

874
00:55:56,703 --> 00:55:58,793
- He won it isn't fair.

875
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,923
- True maggot, but then
the rules can change.

876
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:04,073
You win some, you lose some.

877
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:05,373
What can honest men do?

878
00:56:06,453 --> 00:56:07,793
- What's going to happen now?

879
00:56:07,793 --> 00:56:10,293
- Oh that I can tell you.

880
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:12,403
You're gonna endure the pit of flame.

881
00:56:13,853 --> 00:56:16,283
Once the stone plug is removed,

882
00:56:16,283 --> 00:56:19,743
the sacred liquid runs
down this channel and--

883
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:21,273
- Is set on fire by the rock.

884
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:25,653
Back it comes and poof we go up in smoke.

885
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:26,975
- Wha?

886
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:28,433
- We're sitting in a bath of oil.

887
00:56:29,393 --> 00:56:32,033
So when does the entertainment begin?

888
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:35,603
- Oh, ah, now!

889
00:56:36,618 --> 00:56:41,618
(dramatic music)
(laughs)

890
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:43,991
- Those pods, how many do you have left?

891
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:46,824
(dramatic music)

892
00:56:48,178 --> 00:56:49,946
Quick!

893
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:52,779
(dramatic music)

894
00:56:54,393 --> 00:56:55,757
The amber light.

895
00:56:55,757 --> 00:56:58,590
(dramatic music)

896
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,083
Just hope this works.

897
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:05,276
(dramatic music)

898
00:57:05,276 --> 00:57:07,134
Give or take a few seconds.

899
00:57:07,134 --> 00:57:08,427
Malachi!

900
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:11,094
(watch beeping)

901
00:57:13,873 --> 00:57:15,513
(lock bursting)

902
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:17,476
(dramatic music)

903
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,946
(fire hissing)

904
00:57:18,946 --> 00:57:21,962
(log whistling)

905
00:57:21,962 --> 00:57:23,848
(horses stampeding)

906
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:27,711
(dramatic music)
(men shouting)

907
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:31,849
(pod gun firing)
(sword whistling)

908
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:36,849
(dramatic music)
(men shouting)

909
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:02,968
I don't know who you are but--

910
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:04,686
(Dan strangling)

911
00:58:04,686 --> 00:58:07,726
- Oop.
(Qahhar grunting)

912
00:58:07,726 --> 00:58:11,081
(Dan coughing)

913
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,590
Wonderful guy.

914
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,652
(Qahhar grunting)

915
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:17,502
- The green man can talk to anything.

916
00:58:20,353 --> 00:58:21,823
- His name is Qahhar.

917
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,113
Your woman saved his life some suns ago.

918
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:25,013
- You mean Carrie?

919
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:28,153
- I told him that you were her friend.

920
00:58:28,153 --> 00:58:29,223
He will go with us.

921
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:31,863
- I wouldn't think of going without him.

922
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:33,713
Only trouble is we don't have horses.

923
00:58:34,675 --> 00:58:36,413
(dramatic music)

924
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:39,033
- The sun is still high Shareen.

925
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:42,393
Time enough to burn out
your jealousy and pride.

926
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:45,183
You should have chosen me half-breed.

927
00:58:46,593 --> 00:58:49,553
But before the day is done
you'll have the answer

928
00:58:49,553 --> 00:58:52,103
to the riddle of this death pit.

929
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:56,163
Why is it that when we
leave our dead slaves here,

930
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,913
they're all gone by the morning.

931
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:01,844
You will be the only one
who knows what happens,

932
00:59:01,844 --> 00:59:04,081
when night falls.

933
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:09,081
(dramatic music)
(Bosk clicking)

934
00:59:20,095 --> 00:59:22,595
(eerie music)

935
00:59:24,042 --> 00:59:25,145
- What the?

936
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,578
- He's calling the horses.

937
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:30,750
- You mean he really can do that?

938
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,331
- We'll soon find out.

939
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:37,331
(eerie music)
(horses clomping)

940
00:59:37,822 --> 00:59:40,277
You know, I never really
believed it til now.

941
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,777
(eerie music)

942
00:59:49,262 --> 00:59:51,758
(men chattering)

943
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:54,341
(gentle music)

944
01:00:05,056 --> 01:00:07,889
(dramatic music)

945
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:51,163
- It saddens me to find
you this way Miss Madison.

946
01:00:51,163 --> 01:00:52,963
- Well get me out of here then.

947
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:54,583
- Impossible.

948
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:56,883
Kleel is not the kind
of man to cross lightly.

949
01:00:57,913 --> 01:01:00,643
You've no doubt already
encountered a particular brand

950
01:01:00,643 --> 01:01:01,573
of megalomania.

951
01:01:02,503 --> 01:01:03,933
But how did you get here?

952
01:01:03,933 --> 01:01:06,663
- That damn machine of yours, how else.

953
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,553
I came through about a second after Dan.

954
01:01:10,553 --> 01:01:11,386
Dan?

955
01:01:11,386 --> 01:01:12,219
Who's Dan?

956
01:01:13,143 --> 01:01:13,976
- A friend.

957
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:16,653
A friend Kleel murdered.

958
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:19,843
- I'm, I'm sorry to that.

959
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:22,556
Then that means

960
01:01:22,556 --> 01:01:25,083
that the matter transmitter
is still functioning.

961
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,913
Then there is a way back.

962
01:01:26,913 --> 01:01:28,273
- What are you doing here?

963
01:01:28,273 --> 01:01:29,183
With Kleel?

964
01:01:29,183 --> 01:01:30,543
- Survival.

965
01:01:30,543 --> 01:01:32,503
This is a strange and violent land.

966
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,913
Kleel almost had me
slaving away in his mines

967
01:01:36,913 --> 01:01:39,433
but with a few scientific tricks,

968
01:01:39,433 --> 01:01:41,803
I persuaded him I was a sorcerer.

969
01:01:41,803 --> 01:01:43,663
You've possibly seen the pistols.

970
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:46,193
- You son of a bitch!

971
01:01:47,793 --> 01:01:50,083
Then it was your guns that killed Dan.

972
01:01:50,083 --> 01:01:51,163
- No.

973
01:01:51,163 --> 01:01:53,013
Kleel murdered your friend.

974
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,123
- And that let you off, huh?

975
01:01:55,123 --> 01:01:57,503
So you can go and make more guns for them.

976
01:01:57,503 --> 01:01:59,773
- Kleel is not a fool.

977
01:01:59,773 --> 01:02:01,913
So long as he is the
only possessor of guns,

978
01:02:01,913 --> 01:02:03,893
who can stand against him.

979
01:02:03,893 --> 01:02:05,533
He was also wise enough

980
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:07,743
to know I can give an even greater power.

981
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:10,573
- What have you done Hartmann?

982
01:02:11,423 --> 01:02:12,403
- You must understand I've had

983
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:15,343
to work with very primitive
means at my disposal.

984
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:21,133
Even so I've managed to create a primitive

985
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:25,223
but potent equivalent to nitroglycerin.

986
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,913
- You're a goddam maniac.

987
01:02:29,077 --> 01:02:30,053
- You disappoint me.

988
01:02:31,743 --> 01:02:34,303
I would have thought you'd
have been far more realistic.

989
01:02:35,243 --> 01:02:36,793
Do as I have done.

990
01:02:36,793 --> 01:02:38,993
Humor him and survive.

991
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:42,753
Kleel will rule this land
with the power I can give him.

992
01:02:44,703 --> 01:02:48,003
- Let Kleel rule and the rest can go spit.

993
01:02:50,703 --> 01:02:52,703
I said it to him and I'll say it to you.

994
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:56,325
Go to hell!

995
01:02:56,325 --> 01:02:59,075
(dramatic music)

996
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,827
(upbeat music)

997
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,304
- What's wrong?

998
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:30,883
- He says he needs water.

999

1006
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:51,553
- What do you see?

1007
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:56,613
- There is something moving.

1008
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,257

1009

Evil, unclean.

1016

- Where the hell are we?

1024
01:07:03,993 --> 01:07:06,493
- We're lost, I know we're lost.

1025
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:09,325

(dramatic music)
(footsteps clattering)

1034
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:52,348

1035
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:53,181
- What?

1036
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:56,664

(dramatic music)

1051
01:09:48,673 --> 01:09:49,506
Let's go.

1052
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,983
(gentle music)

1053
01:09:52,983 --> 01:09:54,891

- Get the hell outta here.

1055

(footsteps clicking)

1057
01:10:38,223 --> 01:10:39,123

1058
01:10:40,033 --> 01:10:41,653
- What?

1059
01:10:41,653 --> 01:10:42,486
- If I may.

1060
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:46,903
The liquid is still in
the highly volatile state.

1061
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:50,683
- I swear I'd understand you better

1062
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:52,093
if you didn't have a tongue.

1063
01:10:53,573 --> 01:10:55,023
- Forgive me Your Excellency.

1064
01:10:56,323 --> 01:10:59,113
Perhaps if I were to show you
what I've already created.

1065
01:10:59,113 --> 01:10:59,946
- Mm.

1066
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,640
(liquid thundering)

1067
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,999
- The power.

1068
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:36,353
You already have it's source.

1069
01:11:41,953 --> 01:11:43,643
- What is it?

1070
01:11:44,853 --> 01:11:46,293
- Clean air.

1071
01:11:46,293 --> 01:11:48,143
This way.

1072
01:11:48,143 --> 01:11:49,573
There's a boulder.

1073
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:50,613
Qahhar!

1074
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:51,642
Push!

(Qahhar grunting)

1078
01:11:57,263 --> 01:11:58,377
Push!

Push!

1080
01:12:01,335 --> 01:12:02,168
Push!

1081
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:06,785

(Malachi groaning)

1084
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,130

01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,880
(dramatic music)

1086

(Qahhar grunting)

1092
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:05,616

1093
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:11,166
(Dan grunting)

1094
01:13:19,523 --> 01:13:20,821
Where'd the big guy go?

1095
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:21,893
- Who knows.

1096
01:13:26,554 --> 01:13:28,443
(dramatic music)

1097
01:13:28,443 --> 01:13:30,033
We'll never get in.

1098
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:31,075
Look!

1099
01:13:31,075 --> 01:13:33,131
(dramatic music)

1100
01:13:33,131 --> 01:13:34,923
(Qahhar grunting)

1101
01:13:34,923 --> 01:13:37,367

1102
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:42,367
(dramatic music)
(Qahhar grunting)

1103
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:51,034
- Go.

1104
01:13:54,772 --> 01:13:55,605
Go.

1105
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:59,463
(dramatic music)

1106
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:05,071
(dramatic music)

(Qahhar screaming)

1110
01:14:16,683 --> 01:14:17,516
- Get it up!

1111
01:14:17,516 --> 01:14:18,349
- There's nothing we can do.

1112
01:14:18,349 --> 01:14:19,182
We must find your woman.

1113
01:14:19,182 --> 01:14:20,015
- Yes but where?

1114
01:14:21,313 --> 01:14:22,613
- I will show you the way.

1115
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,603
(men laughing)

1116
01:14:30,712 --> 01:14:32,168

1117
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:34,751

01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:50,279
(footsteps thudding)

1121
01:15:04,506 --> 01:15:09,506
- To good for the likes of me, huh.

1122
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:11,900
Nobody can hear you now woman.

1123
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,161
Nobody!

1124
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:15,911
(dramatic music)

1125
01:15:16,852 --> 01:15:18,172
- [Carrie] Get away from me!

1126
01:15:18,172 --> 01:15:19,474
(Carrie screaming)

1127

1128
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:21,971
No!

1129
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:23,682
No!
(Bosk laughing)

1130
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:24,934

01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:27,851
(Carrie screaming)

1132
01:15:30,394 --> 01:15:31,338

1133
01:15:31,338 --> 01:15:33,063
(dramatic music)

1134
01:15:33,063 --> 01:15:35,730
(body thudding)

1135
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:39,454
(foot thudding)

1136
01:15:40,643 --> 01:15:42,792
- Try me son of a bitch.

1137
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,228
(Bosk grunting)

1138
01:15:44,228 --> 01:15:45,061
(dramatic music)

1139
01:15:45,061 --> 01:15:47,384
(fists thudding)

1140
01:15:47,384 --> 01:15:49,960
(dramatic music)

1141
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,627
(Carrie crying)

1142
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:03,587
- God I thought you were dead.

1143
01:16:03,643 --> 01:16:05,563
- Yeah, well I though you were about

1144
01:16:05,563 --> 01:16:07,683
to suffer fate worse than death.

1145
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:09,543
- We cannot stay here.

1146
01:16:09,543 --> 01:16:10,767
Come.

1147
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:11,600
- Yeah.

1148
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,993
- Wait Dan, Hartmann is here.

1149
01:16:13,993 --> 01:16:15,523
He's Kleel's sorcerer.

1150
01:16:15,523 --> 01:16:16,994
- He's what?

1151
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:18,933
- He's made nitro.

1152
01:16:18,933 --> 01:16:20,413
If Kleel gets his hands on it.

1153
01:16:20,413 --> 01:16:21,353
- Where is he?

1154
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:22,801
- [Shareen] I'll take you there.

1155
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,717
- Let's get outta here.

1156
01:16:24,717 --> 01:16:27,550
(dramatic music)

1157
01:16:41,073 --> 01:16:43,503
- God how did you get here?

1158
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:45,564
I don't understand.

1159
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:46,397
Who are these people.

1160
01:16:46,397 --> 01:16:48,053
- There's no time for
question and answer games.

1161
01:16:48,053 --> 01:16:49,033
Carrie, tie him up.

1162
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:51,603
And Hartmann any noise and I'll use this.

1163
01:16:51,603 --> 01:16:53,153
I wish you'd both listen to me.

1164
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:57,373
Only a powerful ruler such as
Kleel can provide the means

1165
01:16:57,373 --> 01:16:58,493
to return to our own time.

1166
01:16:58,493 --> 01:16:59,433
Can't you see that?

1167
01:16:59,433 --> 01:17:01,433
- No, and I don't intend
to use Kleel for anything.

1168
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,266
- No stop!

1169
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:05,333
There's enough combustible material here

1170
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,173
to blow us all sky-high!

1171
01:17:07,173 --> 01:17:08,073
- What's going on?

1172
01:17:09,303 --> 01:17:10,953
Does he bring some kind of magic?

1173
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,093
- Where's all the nitro?

1174
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:14,766
- It's not here.

1175
01:17:14,766 --> 01:17:15,965
- You're lying but I don't have the time

1176
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,127
to beat it out of ya, so get
your miserable hide outta here.

1177
01:17:18,127 --> 01:17:18,960
Move it!

1178
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:26,862
I don't think you girls
will give us any trouble.

1179
01:17:29,676 --> 01:17:32,259
(Bosk moaning)

1180
01:17:33,969 --> 01:17:34,969
- The woman.

1181
01:17:37,005 --> 01:17:39,755
(dramatic music)

1182
01:18:08,153 --> 01:18:08,986
- Down.

1183
01:18:10,142 --> 01:18:12,975
(dramatic music)

1184
01:18:19,193 --> 01:18:20,433
Ah Shareen.

1185
01:18:22,293 --> 01:18:24,605
Your life was already finished.

1186
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:26,383
(gun firing)

1187
01:18:26,383 --> 01:18:27,216
- Bastard!

1188
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:28,393
- I must have missed you before.

1189
01:18:28,393 --> 01:18:30,279
- Ah, hold it.

1190
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:31,112
(dramatic music)

1191
01:18:31,112 --> 01:18:32,613
- No leave him be.

1192
01:18:33,863 --> 01:18:35,423
- That's better.

1193
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:37,313
Begging your Excellencies pardon,

1194
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:40,173
I'm just a humble thief who
would like to make a deal.

1195
01:18:40,173 --> 01:18:42,703
- I don't make bargains.

1196
01:18:42,703 --> 01:18:44,883
- Ah but this is just a little deal.

1197
01:18:44,883 --> 01:18:46,473
- Malachi, for pity's
sake just take it easy

1198
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:47,306
with that thing.

1199
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:51,775
- Safe passage out of here
and a little something

1200
01:18:51,775 --> 01:18:53,313
for my trouble.

1201
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:55,733
Now that's not too much to ask, is it?

1202
01:18:55,733 --> 01:18:57,113
- For God's sake quit while you're ahead.

1203
01:18:57,113 --> 01:18:58,763
We'll just take the safe passage.

1204
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:02,583
- What makes you think I'd
let you all out of here alive?

1205
01:19:03,983 --> 01:19:04,983
- Okay just me then.

1206
01:19:06,203 --> 01:19:07,393
- You little louse.

1207
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:10,423
- And if I refuse?

1208
01:19:10,423 --> 01:19:13,633
- I let the magic out
of the bottle don't I?

1209
01:19:13,633 --> 01:19:16,583
- Then you'd simply be pouring
away a decent flask of wine.

1210
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:18,366
- Wine?

1211
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:19,199
- I'm afraid so.

1212
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:22,513
I seem to recognize the
flask you're holding.

1213
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,983
- She told me it was the magic potion.

1214
01:19:28,283 --> 01:19:29,116
Wine.

1215
01:19:30,414 --> 01:19:33,081
(flask booming)

1216
01:19:38,589 --> 01:19:40,263
(hand slapping)

1217
01:19:40,263 --> 01:19:43,393
It seemed like a really
good idea at the time.

1218
01:19:43,393 --> 01:19:45,963
I was gonna get help
and come back for you.

1219
01:19:45,963 --> 01:19:47,343
I swear it.

1220
01:19:47,343 --> 01:19:49,003
Cut out my heart if I tell a lie.

1221
01:19:49,003 --> 01:19:50,033
- Don't tempt me.

1222
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,933
- I need you help.

1223
01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:56,063
- I have nothing to say to you.

1224
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:57,643
- Well I have something to say to you.

1225
01:19:57,643 --> 01:19:58,903
And you'd better listen.

1226
01:19:58,903 --> 01:20:00,939
I'll blow the whistle on you Hartmann.

1227
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:02,243
- You can't blackmail me.

1228
01:20:02,243 --> 01:20:03,273
- Oh!

1229
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:06,313
But you forget he listens to me now,

1230
01:20:06,313 --> 01:20:09,333
how else would I have been able
to save Dan and the others.

1231
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,813
The stories I could tell
would curl your toes.

1232
01:20:12,943 --> 01:20:14,183
Now just what do you think he'd do

1233
01:20:14,183 --> 01:20:15,683
if he found you plotting his death

1234
01:20:15,683 --> 01:20:17,743
with your powders and potions?

1235
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:19,696
- Damn you!

1236
01:20:23,513 --> 01:20:24,663
What you want me to do?

1237
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,333
- What do you want?

1238
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,973
- Believe it or not I'm here to help you.

1239
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:35,533
- What do you take me for Hartmann?

1240
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:36,613
- You may not know it

1241
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:39,511
but it was I who persuaded
Kleel to spare your lives.

1242
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:40,344
(Dan scoffs)

1243
01:20:40,344 --> 01:20:42,523
I cannot have your
deaths on my conscience.

1244
01:20:42,523 --> 01:20:45,083
- I find that just a
little hard to believe.

1245
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:47,260
- I have no time to persuade you now

1246
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,753
but you must give me your
word that if I set you free,

1247
01:20:50,753 --> 01:20:52,833
all of you will leave
this place immediately.

1248
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:54,033
- Yes he gives his word.

1249
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:57,323
- Where's Carrie?

1250
01:20:57,323 --> 01:20:58,743
- She's decided to stay.

1251
01:20:58,743 --> 01:20:59,576
- You're lying.

1252
01:21:00,508 --> 01:21:02,658
- Who knows what goes
on in a woman's mind.

1253
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:06,313
- We're all men of the world.

1254
01:21:06,313 --> 01:21:07,313
These things happen.

1255
01:21:08,273 --> 01:21:09,473
Now do I have your word?

1256
01:21:11,043 --> 01:21:13,853
If you can't think for
yourself think of your friends.

1257
01:21:13,853 --> 01:21:15,303
- Yes, think of your friends.

1258
01:21:19,633 --> 01:21:20,466
- All right.

1259
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,243
All right you got it.

1260
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,720
(Hartmann groaning)

1261
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,660
- You, you gave me your word.

1262
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,463
- This world has taught
me on thing Hartmann.

1263
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:39,867
Trust no one and you and I have
a little unfinished business

1264
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:44,353
to take care of.

1265
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:49,580
- [Malachi] Whoop!

1266
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:50,413
(dramatic music)

1267
01:21:50,413 --> 01:21:51,246
- Leave us, leave us.

1268
01:21:51,246 --> 01:21:52,213
I don't want to be disturbed.

1269
01:21:53,411 --> 01:21:56,244
(dramatic music)

1270
01:22:04,183 --> 01:22:05,016
This is for you.

1271
01:22:07,027 --> 01:22:07,860
Open it.

1272
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,763
(dramatic music)

1273
01:22:11,763 --> 01:22:13,033
It's a gift, open it.

1274
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:16,735
(dramatic music)

1275
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:20,273
Open it damn you!

1276
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:21,853
You and I have an agreement.

1277
01:22:23,263 --> 01:22:25,663
Don't forget your friends
are still in my power.

1278
01:22:26,713 --> 01:22:30,263
I gave you their lives in
return for your cooperation.

1279
01:22:32,302 --> 01:22:35,135
(dramatic music)

1280
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:40,023
Open it, please.

1281
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:43,529
(gentle music)

1282
01:22:53,483 --> 01:22:55,293
- It's very beautiful.

1283
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:57,533
- Yes, isn't it.

1284
01:22:57,533 --> 01:23:01,533
It was a lucky charm
of a warrior chieftain.

1285
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:03,933
He still believed that
it would save his life

1286
01:23:03,933 --> 01:23:06,333
even as I pushed my
sword between his ribs.

1287
01:23:07,913 --> 01:23:10,023
- You have a way of ruining everything.

1288
01:23:11,203 --> 01:23:12,933
- So I ruin everything do I?

1289
01:23:15,083 --> 01:23:16,423
Do not patronize me.

1290
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:20,813
I've offered you more than
I've offered any woman

1291
01:23:20,813 --> 01:23:22,973
and you spit in my face
as if I were a beggar.

1292
01:23:24,603 --> 01:23:26,536
(dramatic music)

1293
01:23:26,536 --> 01:23:27,369
You go to far.

1294
01:23:31,523 --> 01:23:32,356
- I'm sorry.

1295
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:37,523
(Kleel scoffs)

1296
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:39,366
- Thank you.

1297
01:23:43,103 --> 01:23:45,893
- Now you will be careful
how you handle those flasks.

1298
01:23:45,893 --> 01:23:48,383
One slip and there's enough
nitro to open up the mountain

1299
01:23:48,383 --> 01:23:50,523
and blow entire fortress sky-high.

1300
01:23:50,523 --> 01:23:52,973
- Comes a time when you
have to live dangerously.

1301
01:23:58,573 --> 01:23:59,573
You know what to do.

1302
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,106
Malachi.

1303
01:24:02,106 --> 01:24:02,939
- Yeah?

1304
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,363
- The powder you make for
Kleel's guns, I need it.

1305
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:09,776
Now!

1306
01:24:15,494 --> 01:24:17,503
We've gotta move while it's still dark.

1307
01:24:17,503 --> 01:24:20,203
I'll lay enough fuse to make
this place blow in about,

1308
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:24,475
Malachi, give me back my watch!

1309
01:24:24,475 --> 01:24:26,463
(watch beeping)

1310
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:27,383
Take him with ya.

1311
01:24:39,249 --> 01:24:41,999
(dramatic music)

1312
01:24:50,761 --> 01:24:53,428
(upbeat music)

1313
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:10,011
(flask clanking)

1314
01:25:10,011 --> 01:25:11,344
- What was that?

1315
01:25:17,534 --> 01:25:20,117
(upbeat music)

1316
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:44,119
(dramatic music)

1317
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,134
(horse neighing)

1318
01:26:08,134 --> 01:26:10,884
(dramatic music)

1319
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:18,621
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1320
01:26:18,621 --> 01:26:21,371
(dramatic music)

1321
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:48,036
(fire sizzling)

1322
01:26:57,064 --> 01:27:00,647
- I told you I didn't
want to be disturbed!

1323
01:27:05,147 --> 01:27:07,897
- Please I'd like some more wine.

1324
01:27:08,894 --> 01:27:09,894
- Very well.

1325
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:12,826
Quickly.

1326
01:27:31,437 --> 01:27:32,914
(fist thudding)

1327
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,414
(body thudding)
(Dan groaning)

1328
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:36,247
- Drop it!

1329
01:27:39,574 --> 01:27:41,413
I said drop it!

1330
01:27:50,703 --> 01:27:52,323
I'm warning you.

1331
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:53,823
You take one more step

1332
01:27:53,823 --> 01:27:56,023
and I'll blow your goddamn head off.

1333
01:28:05,224 --> 01:28:07,974
(Carrie gasping)

1334
01:28:14,433 --> 01:28:17,010
You conceited bastard!

1335
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:18,787
(fist thudding)

1336
01:28:18,787 --> 01:28:20,213
(gun firing)

1337
01:28:20,213 --> 01:28:23,523
- That's doin' it.

1338
01:28:23,523 --> 01:28:25,703
- Dan, Dan, come one.

1339
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,164
(flask booming)

1340
01:28:30,164 --> 01:28:31,403
- Dan, please.

1341
01:28:31,403 --> 01:28:33,790
Get up, get the sword.

1342
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:34,623
- Sword.
- The sword.

1343
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:38,458
- Come on.

1344
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:40,789
- Wait, wait I gotta get this off.

1345
01:28:40,789 --> 01:28:43,539
(dramatic music)

1346
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,250
Okay.

1347
01:28:46,477 --> 01:28:51,477
(flasks booming)
(men shouting)

1348
01:28:54,377 --> 01:28:56,936
(dramatic music)
(fire sizzling)

1349
01:28:56,936 --> 01:28:58,662
(dramatic music)
(swords clanking)

1350
01:28:58,662 --> 01:29:01,245
(men shouting)

1351
01:29:06,862 --> 01:29:08,129
- Dan!

1352
01:29:08,129 --> 01:29:10,879
(dramatic music)

1353
01:29:12,913 --> 01:29:14,939
- [Dan] This way!

1354
01:29:14,939 --> 01:29:16,693
(dramatic music)

1355
01:29:16,693 --> 01:29:17,623
- Where are they?

1356
01:29:19,193 --> 01:29:20,849
I'm ready.

1357
01:29:20,849 --> 01:29:23,281
(arrow whooshing)

1358
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:24,969
(pod gun whooshing)

1359
01:29:24,969 --> 01:29:27,008
(dramatic music)

1360
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:29,243
(flasks exploding)

1361
01:29:29,243 --> 01:29:30,076
- Stop!

1362
01:29:32,265 --> 01:29:35,206
(Qahhar grunting)

1363
01:29:35,206 --> 01:29:37,583
(fire whooshing)

1364
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,905
- Kleel's law is harsh.

1365
01:29:39,905 --> 01:29:42,155
(laughing)

1366
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:45,463
- I need the gun.

1367
01:29:47,534 --> 01:29:49,934
- To be clear, I can't drive.

1368
01:29:49,934 --> 01:29:53,425
(Malachi moaning)
(pod gun whooshing)

1369
01:29:53,425 --> 01:29:55,585
(fortress crashing)

1370
01:29:55,585 --> 01:29:58,335
(dramatic music)

1371
01:30:37,784 --> 01:30:41,173
(Qahhar grunting)

1372
01:30:41,173 --> 01:30:43,803
- What about that invisible doorway, doc?

1373
01:30:43,803 --> 01:30:45,223
- It's hopeless.

1374
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:46,273
Don't you understand.

1375
01:30:47,243 --> 01:30:49,163
The chances of our finding
the things I transmitted

1376
01:30:49,163 --> 01:30:50,563
are 10 million to one.

1377
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:54,086
- Then I suggest we start lookin'.

1378
01:30:54,086 --> 01:30:54,919
- Gold!

1379
01:31:01,257 --> 01:31:04,090
(dramatic music)

1380
01:31:06,743 --> 01:31:08,173
- What have you found?

1381
01:31:08,173 --> 01:31:11,253
- Just some cast off bauble
with strange markings on it.

1382
01:31:11,253 --> 01:31:12,443
- Markings?

1383
01:31:12,443 --> 01:31:14,443
- Scribbling, how do I know I can't read.

1384
01:31:14,443 --> 01:31:15,913
- Thank you.

1385
01:31:15,913 --> 01:31:17,193
- That's it!

1386
01:31:17,193 --> 01:31:18,555
Goddamn it!

1387
01:31:18,555 --> 01:31:20,094
That's it!

1388
01:31:20,094 --> 01:31:22,184
- Where'd you find this?

1389
01:31:22,184 --> 01:31:24,934
(dramatic music)

1390
01:31:29,145 --> 01:31:31,170
(transmitter whirring)

1391
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:32,819
- No, no!

1392
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:33,848
Wait!

1393
01:31:33,848 --> 01:31:37,098
(transmitter whirring)

1394
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,319
- Where have they gone?

1395
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:44,427
(watch beeping)

1396
01:31:44,427 --> 01:31:46,177
What about the watch?

1397
01:31:49,326 --> 01:31:51,993
(upbeat music)
