1
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well boys, I hate to break up a good party...</font>

2
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you can't keep
a woman waiting, can you?</font>

3
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:45,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how it is, boys.
- Yes we do, Mr. Hogarth.</font>

4
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:48,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, JJ.
- I'll say you can't, JJ.</font>

5
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:51,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I see you can all understand, all right.</font>

6
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:56,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well believe you me, boys,
I've had the time of my life tonight.</font>

7
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">And speaking of time, I have here...</font>

8
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,912
<font color="#FFFFFF">a 14-karat 17-jewel timepiece.</font>

9
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that's only right, because...</font>

10
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">the man I'm giving it to
is a 14-karat 17-jewel cashier.</font>

11
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:12,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hear hear.
- Hear hear.</font>

12
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:13,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pass it along to him, boys.</font>

13
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a beautiful watch, JJ.
- It's wonderful.</font>

14
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

15
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:29,810
<font color="#FFFFFF">Read what's engraved inside, Chris.</font>

16
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">To my friend Christopher Cross...</font>

17
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:40,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">in token of 25 years of faithful service,</font>

18
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:46,064
<font color="#FFFFFF">from JJ Hogarth, 1909-1934.</font>

19
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speech. Speech.</font>

20
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:52,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Speak up, Chris, speak up.
- Come on, Chris, speech.</font>

21
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I...</font>

22
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hardly know what to say, JJ.</font>

23
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:01,032
<font color="#FFFFFF">This... why, it's beautiful.</font>

24
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:05,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never expected to own a watch like this.</font>

25
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">No sir, I...</font>

26
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:10,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... all I can say is that...</font>

27
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:14,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">we've got the best boss in New York.</font>

28
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good going, friend.</font>

29
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations, old boy,
congratulations.</font>

30
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good boy, good boy.</font>

31
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:36,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, Chris.
Thank you, my old friend.</font>

32
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">God bless you.
- Thank you.</font>

33
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have a smoke before I go.
- Well, I... don't usually, JJ.</font>

34
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and try it.</font>

35
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's made special for me.
A dollar apiece.</font>

36
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:49,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, Charlie.
- Oh, thanks.</font>

37
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:00,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

38
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not supersticious,
are you, Chris?</font>

39
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no sir, no sir.</font>

40
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now don't break up a good party,
just because I've got to go.</font>

41
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,668
<font color="#FFFFFF">Everything is charged to JJ.</font>

42
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's very nice of you, boss.</font>

43
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:14,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can drink all you want...</font>

44
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:19,840
<font color="#FFFFFF">only don't come in late Monday
morning with a hangover.</font>

45
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, boys.</font>

46
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:24,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

47
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:32,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aren't you a lucky dog. - I'll
treasure this for the rest of my life.</font>

48
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet you will.</font>

49
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:39,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey fellas, look.
Look, come here.</font>

50
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hurry.</font>

51
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:51,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get a load of that dame.</font>

52
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's JJ's wife?</font>

53
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:58,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">The boss is stepping out.</font>

54
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had his dough, I'd step out too.
- Must be a load of laundry tonight.</font>

55
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:15,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's nothing like the smell of spring.</font>

56
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which way do you go, Chris?</font>

57
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'll take the East Side subway.</font>

58
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:22,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It gets me to Brooklyn a little quicker.</font>

59
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:27,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey, you haven't got an umbrella.
No, I'll take you to your bus.</font>

60
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:30,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's out of your way.
- I don't mind walking.</font>

61
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:32,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fresh air, the spring.</font>

62
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a little drunk.</font>

63
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:55,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never mind, I'll catch the next one.</font>

64
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:56,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You go on over to the subway.</font>

65
00:06:56,755 --> 00:07:01,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I don't mind waiting,
I feel kind of lonely tonight.</font>

66
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, Charlie...</font>

67
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">You suppose JJ is running around
with that young lady?</font>

68
00:07:09,675 --> 00:07:11,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">It looks that way.</font>

69
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder what it's like.
- What, Chris?</font>

70
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:20,871
<font color="#FFFFFF">To be loved by a young girl like that.</font>

71
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:25,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, nobody ever looked at me
like that, not even when I was young.</font>

72
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:28,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, when we're young we have
dreams that never pan out...</font>

73
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:30,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">but we go on dreaming.</font>

74
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:33,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was young,
I wanted to be an artist.</font>

75
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dreamt I was going to be a
great painter someday.</font>

76
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:38,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I'm a cashier.</font>

77
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you still paint?
- Yes, every Sunday.</font>

78
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:43,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one way to kill time.</font>

79
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:45,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, Sunday is the one day
of the week I don't like.</font>

80
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:46,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never know what to do with myself.</font>

81
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:53,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you come over tomorrow and
see me? - Thanks, Chris, I'll do that.</font>

82
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Chris.
- Good night, Charlie. See you tomorrow.</font>

83
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:58,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.</font>

84
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">It stopped raining.
- Yeah, half an hour ago.</font>

85
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Which way is it to the East Side subway?</font>

86
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Around the corner, past the 'L',</font>

87
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">four blocks.
- Thank you, Officer.</font>

88
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:23,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I got turned around.</font>

89
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:29,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">These streets are all mixed up
in Greenwich Village. - Yeah.</font>

90
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:14,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is he hurt?</font>

91
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:19,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll go call a policeman.
- No, wait... wait.</font>

92
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer.</font>

93
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:32,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Officer.</font>

94
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:49,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did they go?
- In that direction.</font>

95
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">What does he look like?
- I don't know.</font>

96
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't see his face.
- He took 15 dollars.</font>

97
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:55,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't believe it was all
I had, so he began pushing me around...</font>

98
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:57,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this gentleman ran in
and knocked him down.</font>

99
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's right, Officer,
he was right there.</font>

100
00:09:59,655 --> 00:10:01,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't hold him, he got up and ran.</font>

101
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait here.</font>

102
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, let's get out of here.</font>

103
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:07,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">But we have to wait for the officer.</font>

104
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't want to get my name
in the newspaper, do you?</font>

105
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:11,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">The newspaper?
- Sure.</font>

106
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll have to go down to the
station house and make a complaint.</font>

107
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">And every time they make an arrest,
they send a detective to your house...</font>

108
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:17,425
<font color="#FFFFFF">for weeks. Oh, it's a nuisance.</font>

109
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:20,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't you take me home?
- Why, yes...</font>

110
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, sure... that is...
if you think that...</font>

111
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,705
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, here's where I live.</font>

112
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry I can't ask you to come up.</font>

113
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:39,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I share my apartment
with another girl, Millie.</font>

114
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:43,045
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, and thanks for everything.</font>

115
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you...</font>

116
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:48,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">don't you want a cup of coffee?</font>

117
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:51,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right.</font>

118
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:08,430
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Kitty.
- Hello, Tiny.</font>

119
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:10,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, this is Mr...
- Cross.</font>

120
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:14,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.
- How do you do.</font>

121
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seen Johnny?</font>

122
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,470
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, not since he left here.</font>

123
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:23,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Two coffees, please.
- I think I changed my mind.</font>

124
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could stand a drink-a Rum Collins.</font>

125
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:27,649
<font color="#FFFFFF">One Rum Collins?
- Yes, yes.</font>

126
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:30,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh come on, keep me company.</font>

127
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:34,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you see I've already had
a good deal of champagne...</font>

128
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:37,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want champagne?
- No, no...</font>

129
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:40,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Make mine the same.</font>

130
00:11:41,335 --> 00:11:45,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, ever since I first saw you
I was wondering what your name was.</font>

131
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,771
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty.
- It's really-</font>

132
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katherine, Katherine March.</font>

133
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">My friends call me Kitty.</font>

134
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do your friends call you?</font>

135
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

136
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris Cross.</font>

137
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:05,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris Cross.</font>

138
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:08,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, the boys tease me about it, but</font>

139
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:10,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mind.</font>

140
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:23,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you looking at me?</font>

141
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:25,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is my face dirty?</font>

142
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:27,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's beautiful.</font>

143
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:29,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet it is.</font>

144
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:34,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gee, I'm a sight.</font>

145
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:38,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, sir.</font>

146
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cheers, Chris.</font>

147
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Miss March...</font>

148
00:12:48,895 --> 00:12:50,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty.</font>

149
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Miss-I mean...</font>

150
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty...</font>

151
00:12:54,295 --> 00:12:56,934
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, look... Kitty,</font>

152
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:00,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">since I'm old enough to be your father...</font>

153
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not so old.</font>

154
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't think so?</font>

155
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:06,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not a boy, you're just...</font>

156
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">mature.</font>

157
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:11,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like mature people.</font>

158
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:14,340
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what I wanted to say was...</font>

159
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:18,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">you shouldn't be alone in the
street so late at night.</font>

160
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was coming home from work.</font>

161
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">You work this late?</font>

162
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you do?</font>

163
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Guess.</font>

164
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:35,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an actress.
- Oh, you are clever.</font>

165
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now that you know all about me,
tell me about yourself.</font>

166
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you do?
- I?</font>

167
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you see...
- Don't tell me.</font>

168
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">You work in a bank?
- No.</font>

169
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:50,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well let's see, Greenwich Village
is full of artists...</font>

170
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:53,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I meet you in Greenwich Village...</font>

171
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:55,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be an artist. Right?</font>

172
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I...</font>

173
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes, I paint.
- Of course, you're a painter.</font>

174
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I love paintings.</font>

175
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:04,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">To think I took you for a cashier.</font>

176
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:05,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

177
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know those art galleries
on Fifth Avenue?</font>

178
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">The prices they charge.</font>

179
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw one little picture
that cost 50,000 dollars.</font>

180
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">They called it a...</font>

181
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seesan.
- Cezanne.</font>

182
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:20,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a great French painter.</font>

183
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:22,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to own that painting.</font>

184
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:24,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You would?</font>

185
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 50,000 dollars?</font>

186
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you can't put any price
on masterpieces like that.</font>

187
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're worth... well...</font>

188
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever you can afford to pay for them.</font>

189
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:39,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what, I bet I saw some of
your pictures there and didn't know it.</font>

190
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next time I'll look for your name.</font>

191
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no, no...</font>

192
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,860
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't sell my pictures.</font>

193
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not in New York, you mean?</font>

194
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I...
- I know.</font>

195
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you sell your pictures in Europe,
France or some place like that.</font>

196
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:55,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can tell I don't know
much about painting.</font>

197
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:58,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I bet you get as much for
your pictures in France...</font>

198
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">as those Frenchmen get right
here in New York.</font>

199
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're never appreciated
in your own country.</font>

200
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:07,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's one way of looking at it.</font>

201
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:10,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you know, when I paint
I don't think of money.</font>

202
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:13,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just paint for fun.
- Fun?</font>

203
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:17,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I think it's the
most fun I know, painting.</font>

204
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wish I had all the time to paint.</font>

205
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:22,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">But don't you have time?
- No, I... well... yes...</font>

206
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,611
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, I...</font>

207
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know...</font>

208
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:29,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Business takes a lot of time.</font>

209
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder, when you get all that money.</font>

210
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">What play are you acting in?</font>

211
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">It closed tonight.
- Which one?</font>

212
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:40,305
<font color="#FFFFFF">The one I was in. What time is it?</font>

213
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:48,214
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only ten past two.
- Only?</font>

214
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's time for Kitty to be in bed.</font>

215
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you won't forget me.</font>

216
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

217
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I see you again?
- Sure, sometime.</font>

218
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if you give me your telephone
number... - I haven't got a phone.</font>

219
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I write you?</font>

220
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the address. Good night, Chris.</font>

221
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:12,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty, who is Johnny?</font>

222
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you ask that?</font>

223
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:17,630
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just heard you ask the bartender.</font>

224
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:20,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh sure, he's just a fella I know,
he's Millie's boyfriend.</font>

225
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, the girl I live with?
Good night, Chris.</font>

226
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Kitty.</font>

227
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:03,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher.</font>

228
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:09,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher.</font>

229
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, Adele.</font>

230
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a pleasure. I didn't expect to
see you, Charlie. - But you asked me.</font>

231
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife...</font>

232
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, it's good to see you anyway.</font>

233
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was a swell party last night,
wasn't it, Charlie?</font>

234
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, what time did we go home?</font>

235
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,585
<font color="#FFFFFF">After midnight, wasn't it?</font>

236
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:50,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, I haven't been to bed yet.</font>

237
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:51,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't?</font>

238
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I might as well act as drunk
as I thought I was, eh Charlie?</font>

239
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:55,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no...</font>

240
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I've got to do the dishes for Adele.</font>

241
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:03,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't mind, Charlie, do you?
- No, no, go right ahead.</font>

242
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, did you paint this?</font>

243
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:15,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Great Scott, no. That isn't painting,
that's mud.</font>

244
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:18,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">Done by a photographer.
- Who is it?</font>

245
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">The late departed...</font>

246
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... your wife's former husband.</font>

247
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,163
<font color="#FFFFFF">Detective Sargeant Higgins,
Homer Higgins.</font>

248
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:31,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, that's a real medal, isn't it?</font>

249
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,288
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, Adele got it.</font>

250
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your wife?
- Yeah.</font>

251
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">After he was drowned in the East River.</font>

252
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jumped in to save a woman.</font>

253
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:46,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Neither body was found.</font>

254
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... too bad.</font>

255
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:50,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, too bad.</font>

256
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:02,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, thank you, Charlie.
- Not at all.</font>

257
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:07,365
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you been married, Chris?</font>

258
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Five years...</font>

259
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

260
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:15,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't want to spend his
insurance money, so she...</font>

261
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">rented out a spare room.</font>

262
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">24 dollars a week.</font>

263
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:23,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I was trying to save money to
buy paints,</font>

264
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:25,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I moved in.</font>

265
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:28,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, she was sweet...</font>

266
00:19:28,255 --> 00:19:31,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.</font>

267
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:33,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">And...</font>

268
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:37,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you know how these things go.</font>

269
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Smoke?</font>

270
00:19:39,655 --> 00:19:41,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh...</font>

271
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">guess I better not.</font>

272
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:49,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where are your paintings, Chris?</font>

273
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're out in the hall.</font>

274
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:56,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you like to see what
I did today? - Yes, I'd like to.</font>

275
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:12,165
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you find a flower like that?</font>

276
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:19,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mean you see this
when you look at... that?</font>

277
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,489
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, yes... that is, I sort of feel it.</font>

278
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:27,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You see, when I look at that
flower, I see someone...</font>

279
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is there anything private in this house?</font>

280
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, Adele.</font>

281
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,225
<font color="#FFFFFF">We better get out of here.</font>

282
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, Adele...</font>

283
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:34,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you get those lazy legs
off that couch, maybe?</font>

284
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:36,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come here.</font>

285
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:40,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you do any better than that?</font>

286
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all you think about,
Lazy Legs, hmm?</font>

287
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">What else is there to think about...</font>

288
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you want more heat
in this apartment, Miss...</font>

289
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:55,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll have to call a janitor.
- You idiot.</font>

290
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:57,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">How come you're holding out on me, Baby?</font>

291
00:21:57,615 --> 00:22:00,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, stop talking about Saturday night.</font>

292
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:05,565
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not talking about Saturday night...
I'm talking about this.</font>

293
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">It sounds like a schoolboy
trying to make a date.</font>

294
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:11,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must be robbing the cradle.</font>

295
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's so funny?
- You are.</font>

296
00:22:13,215 --> 00:22:15,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's old enough to be my father.</font>

297
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:19,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the old fellow who came
to my rescue Saturday night... My hero.</font>

298
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">No kidding.</font>

299
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:24,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">See? You were too tight
to remember anything.</font>

300
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:27,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I hadn't told the cop to go in the
wrong direction he'd have picked you up.</font>

301
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">This the old fellow who butted in?</font>

302
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The painter?</font>

303
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:35,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's rich and famous and
very sweet too, Johnny.</font>

304
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">He doesn't pull any rough stuff like you.</font>

305
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:40,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I had a chance
to clean up in a crap game.</font>

306
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:42,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I needed was 50 bucks...</font>

307
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:45,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what did you show up with?
15, for cat's sake.</font>

308
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all I had.</font>

309
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:49,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Besides, you kept me waiting
two hours in the rain.</font>

310
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:53,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then you gave me a dirty look.
- I didn't give you a dirty look.</font>

311
00:22:53,295 --> 00:22:59,925
<font color="#FFFFFF">Any girl who waits 2 hours in the rain
for a guy is gonna give him a dirty look</font>

312
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:04,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Trouble with you, baby, is
you have no imagination.</font>

313
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:09,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to use your brains.</font>

314
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake this chump
is crazy about you.</font>

315
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:14,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is a set-up. He's in
the big money, isn't he?</font>

316
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:17,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">You said 50,000 a picture, didn't you?</font>

317
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:20,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">And here I am, knocking my brains out,
trying to raise a little capital...</font>

318
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:23,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">and this is right in your lap.</font>

319
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to call what's-his-name...</font>

320
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:27,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">and get a measly 50.</font>

321
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">This bird is goofy about you.</font>

322
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Write him, date him up.</font>

323
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:35,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't take money off an old man like that.</font>

324
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:39,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake, get big-hearted...</font>

325
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:42,168
<font color="#FFFFFF">and smart, Lazy Legs.</font>

326
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I see fellas in the big dough
without half my brains...</font>

327
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">but ability isn't enough.</font>

328
00:23:47,335 --> 00:23:50,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">You gotta have money to make money.
Capital.</font>

329
00:23:50,175 --> 00:23:51,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the boys at the Acme Garage would...</font>

330
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:54,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">cut me in on a half-interest if I
can put up the money.</font>

331
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:57,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much do they want?
- Three or four thousand.</font>

332
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:58,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yipe.</font>

333
00:23:58,615 --> 00:24:00,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake, I'm not talking
about chicken feed.</font>

334
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,854
<font color="#FFFFFF">Use your imagination.</font>

335
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You get an interest in a business like that...</font>

336
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:08,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">and it's a cinch to squeeze out
your partners.</font>

337
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're on easy street.</font>

338
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeepers, the pipe dreams you have.</font>

339
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:15,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what about the letter?</font>

340
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:17,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I can get 50 or a hundred perhaps,
but I can't get...</font>

341
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:22,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">the kind of money you're talking about,
I wouldn't know how.</font>

342
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:24,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny.</font>

343
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:27,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny, where are you going?
- Where I won't be wasting my time.</font>

344
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,451
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny, Johnny...</font>

345
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:37,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why I'm so crazy about you.</font>

346
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:39,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yes you do...</font>

347
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what about my proposition?</font>

348
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't have to tap the old
chump for much...</font>

349
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:46,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">not at first.</font>

350
00:24:46,955 --> 00:24:48,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll get you a decent apartment.</font>

351
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:52,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Someplace where I'll like to come and
see you, not a dump like this.</font>

352
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:54,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Lazy Legs?</font>

353
00:24:55,715 --> 00:24:58,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I come in to my own apartment?
- Hello, Funny Face.</font>

354
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:00,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you just move in, Johnny?</font>

355
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:02,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I can move out.
- Now, Millie...</font>

356
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:05,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Stop picking on my fiancé.
- How do you spell that word?</font>

357
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">With an 'F', like in 'Funny Face'.</font>

358
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:10,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">She pays half the rent, doesn't she?</font>

359
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:12,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was the general idea, Big Shot,
when we signed the lease.</font>

360
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:15,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't mind if you want
this place to yourself.</font>

361
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:17,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">To you, Baby.</font>

362
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:25,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's he mean by that?
- Oh, nothing. You know Johnny.</font>

363
00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:27,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I know Johnny all right.</font>

364
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:29,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he bought you
that engagement ring yet?</font>

365
00:25:29,835 --> 00:25:33,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">You seem to worry more about it than I do.</font>

366
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">The new 45-dollar model.</font>

367
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:45,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only Roger let me have it for 18.
He said he made a profit at that.</font>

368
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:47,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you said you were
modeling girdles for the catalog?</font>

369
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have been.</font>

370
00:25:50,795 --> 00:25:52,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ache like a dog.</font>

371
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:57,540
<font color="#FFFFFF">If corsets ever come back,
I swear I'll quit modeling.</font>

372
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:01,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you go back to work?</font>

373
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:04,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">With that figure, if you
weren't so darn lazy...</font>

374
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:08,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who do you think you are,
my guardian angel?</font>

375
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:12,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me, honey. I lost those
wings a long time ago.</font>

376
00:26:12,355 --> 00:26:14,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I thought.</font>

377
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:16,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder you got fired,
you're so darn snippy.</font>

378
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:18,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You never could get to work on time...</font>

379
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">after you met that Johnny.</font>

380
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:23,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Honey, what's happened to you?</font>

381
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you wish it could happen to you.</font>

382
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:28,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm in love, crazy in love.</font>

383
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:30,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">With a man who pushes you around
the way I wouldn't push a cat around.</font>

384
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:31,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You leave Johnny out of this.</font>

385
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">With your looks and figure
you could get any man you want.</font>

386
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:36,712
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, but there's only one I want.</font>

387
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:38,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, and he's making a tramp out of you.</font>

388
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:40,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wouldn't know love if it
hit you in the face.</font>

389
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:44,785
<font color="#FFFFFF">If that's where it hits you,
you ought to know.</font>

390
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">That robin sings just like I feel.</font>

391
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:40,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, there's a pair of them up there,
they're building their nest.</font>

392
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, where'd you learn that?</font>

393
00:27:47,035 --> 00:27:49,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">When I was a kid.</font>

394
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:52,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">But I haven't done that in 40 years.</font>

395
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:54,870
<font color="#FFFFFF">I feel like a kid myself today.</font>

396
00:27:57,995 --> 00:27:59,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sold any pictures lately?</font>

397
00:27:59,675 --> 00:28:00,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

398
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:02,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you paint my picture?</font>

399
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to.</font>

400
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:06,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I bring my easel to your apartment?</font>

401
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:09,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm afraid my girlfriend wouldn't like that.</font>

402
00:28:09,235 --> 00:28:11,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it take you
to paint a picture?</font>

403
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:14,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a day, sometimes a year.</font>

404
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:17,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell, it has to grow.</font>

405
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:19,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never knew paint could grow.</font>

406
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feeling grows.</font>

407
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know,
that's the important thing... feeling.</font>

408
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:26,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you take me, nobody ever
taught me how to draw,</font>

409
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:29,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I just put a line around what
I feel when I look at things.</font>

410
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:30,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, I see.</font>

411
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:32,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's like...</font>

412
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">it's like falling in love, I guess.</font>

413
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know...</font>

414
00:28:38,195 --> 00:28:42,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">First you see someone, and
then it keeps growing...</font>

415
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">until you can't think of anyone else.</font>

416
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:46,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's interesting.</font>

417
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way I look at things,
that's all art is.</font>

418
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:53,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Every painting, if it's
any good, is a love affair.</font>

419
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:56,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never heard anyone talk like that before.</font>

420
00:28:56,795 --> 00:28:58,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well...</font>

421
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:01,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">there aren't many people
you can talk to this way.</font>

422
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you keep it to yourself.</font>

423
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You walk around
with everything bottled up.</font>

424
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:08,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, that's right.</font>

425
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:11,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the way it is with me too.</font>

426
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:16,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sort of keeping things
bottled up too, Chris.</font>

427
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">The truth is, I'm in a jam.</font>

428
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:20,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You, Kitty?
- You probably guessed it...</font>

429
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:21,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm broke.</font>

430
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:26,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Even this dress belongs to Millie,
I can't pay my rent.</font>

431
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much is it?
- Oh, forget it.</font>

432
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:31,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">I shouldn't have told you.</font>

433
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">It'll spoil your day.
- Oh, but Kitty...</font>

434
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:37,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get out of it somehow.</font>

435
00:29:37,635 --> 00:29:39,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't take anything from you, Chris.</font>

436
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:43,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, no... yes... I mean...
- No, no, I couldn't.</font>

437
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:46,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've never taken money from a man
and I'm not going to now.</font>

438
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:48,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm not going to spoil our friendship.</font>

439
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:49,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, but Kitty...</font>

440
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:52,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't pay you back.</font>

441
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:56,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

442
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:58,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I could pay you back.</font>

443
00:29:58,275 --> 00:29:59,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you put up the money
for a studio apartment,</font>

444
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:05,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">then I'd have a place to live, and you
could paint there. Don't you see?</font>

445
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:07,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">You could paint my portrait.</font>

446
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the matter?</font>

447
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:15,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you want to paint my picture?</font>

448
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something I've got
to tell you, Kitty. - What?</font>

449
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:20,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">I deceived you.</font>

450
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:22,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I lied.</font>

451
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a married man, Kitty.</font>

452
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:32,265
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why didn't you tell me, Chris?</font>

453
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:36,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know I'm not the kind to run
around with a married man, don't you?</font>

454
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know what you said
about meeting someone?</font>

455
00:30:40,475 --> 00:30:42,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">How you begin to like them, and...</font>

456
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:46,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you can't think about anybody else?</font>

457
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:48,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have told me
you had a wife, Chris.</font>

458
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:51,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but I'm not in love with her,
Kitty. - Well, you married her.</font>

459
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:55,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was lonely,
I couldn't stand my loneliness.</font>

460
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:59,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor Chris.</font>

461
00:30:59,555 --> 00:31:01,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then you're not angry with me?</font>

462
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:04,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I suppose I ought to be,
but I'm not.</font>

463
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not with you, Chris.</font>

464
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to let you help me.</font>

465
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,210
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much do you need?
- 500 dollars.</font>

466
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:19,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">500...</font>

467
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:05,390
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need 500 dollars.</font>

468
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:08,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I could pay it back 10 dollars a week.</font>

469
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:10,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's all right, Mr. Cross.</font>

470
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll have to have a co-signer.</font>

471
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:14,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you, no.
- Property owner.</font>

472
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:17,645
<font color="#FFFFFF">Property owner?
- Just a formality.</font>

473
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:24,145
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you very much.
- Anytime.</font>

474
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:26,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, write to that old skin-flint Hogarth...</font>

475
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:28,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give you a raise.</font>

476
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't even make enough
money to buy me a radio.</font>

477
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:34,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I have to run downstairs every
night to listen to the radio.</font>

478
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:36,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way I have to scrimp and save...</font>

479
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:39,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">and you wasting money on paints.</font>

480
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:41,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to know what you'd do without me...</font>

481
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poor dear Homer.</font>

482
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:46,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">If only he had a grave where
I could put some flowers.</font>

483
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:48,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, you couldn't ask me to marry you.</font>

484
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had to put the words into your mouth.
I'd have been better off a widow.</font>

485
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:55,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">The only reason I put up with you
is because I'm married to you...</font>

486
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:58,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm stuck.
- Yes, and I'm stuck too.</font>

487
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you been drinking?</font>

488
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:02,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, I haven't.</font>

489
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:05,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me smell your breath.</font>

490
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then what's the matter with you?
Why are you shouting at me?</font>

491
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You keep blaming me for not
buying you a radio.</font>

492
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:15,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You think I like running downstairs
every night to listen to the radio?</font>

493
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you buy a radio? You have
money. - His insurance money?</font>

494
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:20,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I don't want a radio,
you want it.</font>

495
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:24,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll never touch those bonds.
They're for my old age.</font>

496
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:26,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Homer were alive I'd have a radio.</font>

497
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:30,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">He made a good salary.
He gave me a good home.</font>

498
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:32,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you're living in the
same apartment, aren't you?</font>

499
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes... but it didn't smell of paint.</font>

500
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:38,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't sleep for the smell of paint.</font>

501
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:40,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">And all your silly pictures
cluttering up the hall...</font>

502
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:41,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you don't get rid of that trash...</font>

503
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:44,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear I'll give it to the junkman.</font>

504
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adele.
- I will.</font>

505
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear I will.</font>

506
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">And the things you paint...</font>

507
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was bad enough when you used to
copy picture postcards.</font>

508
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:59,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Utrillo copies postcards,
and he's considered a great painter.</font>

509
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:03,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I suppose you're copying
Utrillo or whatever his name is?</font>

510
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">And you're getting
crazier all the time... Oh, yes.</font>

511
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:08,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I saw what you're doing.</font>

512
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Girls... snakes...</font>

513
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:13,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Next thing you'll be painting
women without clothes.</font>

514
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:15,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never saw a woman without any clothes.</font>

515
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:17,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I should hope not.</font>

516
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:27,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Happy Household Hour's
just coming on, dear.</font>

517
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:31,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be right down, Dora.
Mr. Cross came home late.</font>

518
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:36,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead and eat...</font>

519
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">and then do the dishes.</font>

520
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:40,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">'This is The Happy Household Hour...</font>

00:35:57,995 --> 00:35:59,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher.</font>

532
00:36:05,195 --> 00:36:06,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are you doing?</font>

533
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:09,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was...
I was looking for the paper.</font>

534
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:11,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you blind?</font>

535
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:15,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">No. Didn't you...
didn't you like the radio?</font>

536
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:21,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">It went off right in the middle of
a program. I wouldn't have such a radio.</font>

537
00:36:21,995 --> 00:36:24,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, did you read this?
- Read what?</font>

538
00:36:24,435 --> 00:36:26,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">This murder in Queens.</font>

539
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:28,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man killed his wife
with a window weight...</font>

540
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:31,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">put her body in a trunk and
shipped it to California.</font>

541
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">It says here...
- I read the paper, thank you.</font>

542
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">He didn't get away with it, did he?</font>

543
00:36:36,075 --> 00:36:38,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll go to the chair, as he should.</font>

544
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:42,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, a man hasn't got a chance
with these New York detectives.</font>

545
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:46,270
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can't you put that paper down
and do the dishes?</font>

546
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:04,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adele...</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF">you didn't mean what you said...</font>

548
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:07,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">about giving my paintings away
to the junkman?</font>

549
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:09,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'll find out...</font>

550
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:19,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you won't have to.</font>

551
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">A friend of mine is taking an apartment...</font>

552
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">in Greenwich Village,
I'll move everything there.</font>

553
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:28,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, if he's fool enough to let you do it...</font>

554
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:31,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go ahead. The sooner the better.
- Yes.</font>

555
00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:38,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Top floor. You'll get plenty of light.
Lots of privacy.</font>

556
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:41,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You heard of Tony Rivera,
the illustrator?</font>

557
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:43,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">He had this apartment
on a three-year lease.</font>

558
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Couldn't work anywhere else.</font>

559
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">This was his studio.</font>

560
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:52,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">The sketches on the wall are Rivera's.</font>

561
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:54,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'd do that with his models sometimes...</font>

562
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:56,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">when he was working
on a magazine cover.</font>

563
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Some people would pay
a lot of money for those.</font>

564
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:02,065
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are you an artist, Miss March?</font>

565
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where's the bedroom?
- This way.</font>

566
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's the rent, Mr. Jones?</font>

567
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:14,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">150. There are some things that Rivera
left here stored in the basement.</font>

568
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">They go with the apartment if you care
to use them.</font>

569
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you are... the bedroom.</font>

570
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like the wallpaper.</font>

571
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:28,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will they change the paper?</font>

572
00:38:28,635 --> 00:38:30,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess so, on a year's lease.</font>

573
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:33,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll pick it out myself.</font>

574
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, don't break the bank.</font>

575
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Lazy Legs.</font>

576
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:31,310
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought I heard the doorbell.</font>

577
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:34,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't hear anything.</font>

578
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:41,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, is this all you've got?</font>

579
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:45,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm lucky I have that left, the way you
were throwing it around last night.</font>

580
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">You even bought me a book, Honey.</font>

581
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:50,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're supposed to be an actress,
aren't you?</font>

582
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:53,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shakespeare, for Pete's sake.</font>

583
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:02,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, that's all I have left.</font>

584
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:06,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know where to get more,
don't you, Lazy Legs?</font>

585
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:10,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Told me he hadn't sold any pictures
for a long time...</font>

586
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:13,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">And now I'm in hock for all this.</font>

587
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:29,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Kitty...</font>

588
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:33,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">I need at least 1000 dollars.</font>

589
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ouch.
- Well, you've got him softened up...</font>

590
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:39,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now, push him around a bit.</font>

591
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:42,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">He seems to get scared
when I talk about money.</font>

592
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:44,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen Baby, you've got him
right where you want him.</font>

593
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's on the hook and can't get off.</font>

594
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:50,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">He can walk out, can't he?
- He's got a wife, hasn't he?</font>

595
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just drop a hint that his wife might
find out about this apartment...</font>

596
00:40:52,795 --> 00:40:54,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">and he'll shell out fast.</font>

597
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:55,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's blackmail...</font>

598
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:59,192
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's only blackmail, Baby...</font>

599
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:02,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you're dumb enough to get caught.</font>

600
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that him?
- Told you I heard the doorbell.</font>

601
00:41:07,795 --> 00:41:10,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake... Get rid of him.</font>

602
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:44,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why...</font>

603
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:45,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you answer doorbells?</font>

604
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought you were mad at me.
- Peace offering...</font>

605
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scotch.
- Thanks, Honey.</font>

606
00:41:50,835 --> 00:41:53,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't think you were out,
it's only 10 past 12.</font>

607
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:56,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I rang and rang downstairs
and then I found the door was open.</font>

608
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:58,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, well, well.</font>

609
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're doing all right for a working girl.</font>

610
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:05,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now don't start that again.</font>

611
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:12,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't tell me he's under the sofa, too.</font>

612
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:14,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Bright Eyes.</font>

613
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:17,960
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can come out, Johnny.</font>

614
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:21,510
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you have to do is call, Funny Face.</font>

615
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:25,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You must have made a killing in
Wall Street, Mr. Prince...</font>

616
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:27,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be.</font>

617
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:30,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">The last time I saw Johnny he was
talking about going to Hollywood.</font>

618
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:32,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might try it yet.</font>

619
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:35,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I read in a movie magazine about a fella
who landed in Hollywood stone broke...</font>

620
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:38,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">and cleaned up a million.
No experience, either.</font>

621
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:42,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">All he had was looks, and he
worked in a drugstore.</font>

622
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:44,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he worked, Johnny,
he didn't look like you.</font>

623
00:42:44,515 --> 00:42:47,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you two stop fighting?
- I'm not fighting, Baby.</font>

624
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:48,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">She just doesn't know my speed.</font>

625
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:50,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I hear of movie actors...</font>

626
00:42:50,435 --> 00:42:52,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">getting 5000... 10,000 a week.</font>

627
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:53,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">For what?</font>

628
00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:56,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">For acting tough, for pushing
girls in the face.</font>

629
00:42:56,315 --> 00:42:58,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do they do I can't do?</font>

630
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:00,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're so clever, why don't you do it?</font>

631
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:03,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might, Funny Face, I might.</font>

632
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

633
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:14,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I brought over some of my things, Kitty.</font>

634
00:43:14,955 --> 00:43:17,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bring some more tomorrow...</font>

635
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:19,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">The rest on Saturday.</font>

636
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:25,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... You have company.
- It's just Millie and Johnny.</font>

637
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:26,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">John...?
- You know, Millie's boyfriend.</font>

638
00:43:27,075 --> 00:43:28,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on... I want you to meet them.</font>

639
00:43:28,515 --> 00:43:31,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Millie, this is a friend of mine,
Mr. Cross, Miss Ray.</font>

640
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:34,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you do, Miss Ray?
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cross.</font>

641
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:38,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">And... Johnny Prince.
- Glad to know you, Mr. Cross.</font>

642
00:43:39,795 --> 00:43:41,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">How do you do?</font>

643
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:44,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seems to me I've seen you
before somewhere...</font>

644
00:43:44,595 --> 00:43:47,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be... could be, Mr. Cross.</font>

645
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:49,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I...</font>

646
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:52,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just don't seem to remember...
Maybe I'm mistaken.</font>

647
00:43:52,955 --> 00:43:54,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could be.</font>

648
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:58,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I have to run along, kid.
- I'll go with you, sweetheart.</font>

649
00:43:58,955 --> 00:44:00,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, don't bother, Johnny.</font>

650
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wouldn't think of letting
you go alone... Darling.</font>

651
00:44:03,395 --> 00:44:06,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">You might get run over by a streetcar.</font>

652
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:12,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Mr. Cross. Nice to see you.</font>

653
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:16,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks for the scotch, Millie.
- That's okay... Bye.</font>

654
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:19,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">So long, Kitty.
- So long, Johnny.</font>

655
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:25,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what's the matter, Chris?</font>

656
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:28,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't think I like that young man
she's in love with.</font>

657
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:30,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Johnny's all right...</font>

658
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:33,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I know he is, or he wouldn't
be a friend, but...</font>

659
00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:38,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something about him that...
- She's crazy about him.</font>

660
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:42,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you... Would you like
to see my pictures?</font>

661
00:44:42,395 --> 00:44:44,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not yet. Come sit down, Chris.</font>

662
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:50,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You happy?</font>

663
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:53,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">For the first time in my life.
- Very happy?</font>

664
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:56,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think of you all the time.</font>

665
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:59,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">All I want is to see you, be near you.</font>

666
00:45:02,115 --> 00:45:04,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I haven't any right
to ask you this, but...</font>

667
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:06,351
<font color="#FFFFFF">Have you ever...?</font>

668
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:12,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... there must have been
other men who...</font>

669
00:45:14,555 --> 00:45:16,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Just one, Chris.</font>

670
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:19,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">You still see him?</font>

671
00:45:21,795 --> 00:45:23,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've forgotten him.</font>

672
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:27,525
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, Kitty... if I were single...</font>

673
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:30,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">if I had no wife...
- But you have a wife.</font>

674
00:45:30,555 --> 00:45:32,850
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes I know, but if she'd...</font>

675
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:39,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... if something would happen
that would make me free...</font>

676
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:40,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you marry me?</font>

677
00:45:40,795 --> 00:45:42,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, let's not talk about it now, dear.</font>

678
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:44,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">What I'm worried about is getting a job.</font>

679
00:45:44,595 --> 00:45:46,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Living like this... it's expensive.</font>

680
00:45:46,915 --> 00:45:49,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like to ask you for anything more...</font>

681
00:45:49,435 --> 00:45:53,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">because... well, you say you haven't
sold any pictures lately.</font>

682
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:55,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but... don't you have enough money?</font>

683
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:57,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have no idea what a problem
money is for an actress, Chris.</font>

684
00:45:57,915 --> 00:46:00,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Talent doesn't count in the theatre.
Everything is pull.</font>

685
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Contacts, knowing the right people...</font>

686
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:04,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have to get an agent...
they charge plenty...</font>

687
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:09,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wear smart clothes, be attractive.
- But Kitty, you're beautiful.</font>

688
00:46:09,235 --> 00:46:12,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris, your face doesn't mean a thing.</font>

689
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:16,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's clothes, perfumes,
making the right impression.</font>

690
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, an actress needs 1000 dollars
just to get a decent wardrobe.</font>

691
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:22,344
<font color="#FFFFFF">1000 dollars?
- At least.</font>

692
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:27,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe I can borrow it from Millie.
Or her boyfriend... Johnny.</font>

693
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:29,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's got plenty of money.</font>

694
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:33,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh... No, no, no, Kitty.
Not from Johnny.</font>

695
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:35,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why not?</font>

696
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:39,245
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you the money some way...</font>

697
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:42,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris, you're a darling.</font>

698
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:45,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really believe you're in love with me.</font>

699
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I am, Kitty, I am.</font>

700
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:52,833
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris, you're a caveman.</font>

701
00:46:53,115 --> 00:46:56,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">I like you to like me...
well... there's a limit.</font>

702
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, I know...</font>

703
00:47:00,595 --> 00:47:03,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've got to go,
I'm supposed to be back...</font>

704
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:05,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come here tomorrow at noon, Kitty.</font>

705
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:09,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll be waiting for you.
I'm sorry you have to go...</font>

706
00:47:12,835 --> 00:47:14,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye, Dear.</font>

707
00:47:17,795 --> 00:47:20,940
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget the money.
- I'll get it.</font>

708
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:26,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bye-bye, Chris.
- Goodbye.</font>

709
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:16,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

710
00:48:16,795 --> 00:48:18,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">The poor sap must be a hophead, seeing...</font>

711
00:48:18,675 --> 00:48:20,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">snakes on the 'L'.</font>

712
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:25,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine anyone paying
money for this stuff?</font>

713
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,511
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, are you sure he's not a phony?</font>

714
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:31,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's too dumb to be a phony.</font>

715
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:35,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're right there.
- Then how did he get all the money?</font>

716
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:39,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, if he had to work for a living,
he couldn't make 50 dollars a week.</font>

717
00:48:39,235 --> 00:48:41,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">You just don't know art.</font>

718
00:48:41,515 --> 00:48:44,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe not, but I'm gonna find out about it.</font>

719
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:46,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I kinda like this one.</font>

720
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:50,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">But where would you find flowers like that?</font>

721
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:52,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if I couldn't sell these.</font>

722
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:54,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">And what do I do when
he asks where they are?</font>

723
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:56,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say you put them in storage.</font>

724
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:58,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know, you got to protect him...</font>

725
00:48:58,115 --> 00:48:59,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't leave valuable
paintings lying around...</font>

726
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:01,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">where somebody can pick them up.</font>

727
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:06,060
<font color="#FFFFFF">You'd get in trouble.
Any gallery would know his work.</font>

728
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:10,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to kiss me today...
and don't think I liked it.</font>

729
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you've been kissed before.</font>

730
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:15,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say... they're not even signed.</font>

731
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">That doesn't matter, they'd know them.</font>

732
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:19,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not where I take them, Baby.</font>

733
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:24,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny... I can't stand to
have anyone touch me but you.</font>

734
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I hate him when he looks at me like that.</font>

735
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:31,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he were mean or vicious or
if he bawled me out I'd like him better.</font>

736
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:33,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't love me,</font>

737
00:49:33,275 --> 00:49:35,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">or you'd understand what I mean.</font>

738
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?
- No.</font>

739
00:49:48,995 --> 00:49:50,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">No?</font>

740
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:52,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... maybe.</font>

741
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:01,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Working late tonight, Mr. Cross?</font>

742
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:04,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm about through, Ben,
you can let me out in a minute.</font>

743
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:06,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, sir.</font>

744
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:38,805
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just caught you in time.</font>

745
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:53,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cash this for me, will you, Chris?
It's personal.</font>

746
00:50:53,195 --> 00:50:56,028
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, yes... Yes, of course, JJ.</font>

747
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here you are, JJ.
- Thank you, Chris.</font>

748
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,725
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.
Good night, JJ.</font>

749
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Nick.
- Hi.</font>

750
00:51:45,595 --> 00:51:47,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you got?</font>

751
00:51:48,595 --> 00:51:53,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">The fellow who paints those gets
50 grand for a single picture.</font>

752
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:57,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey. What's the matter with you, Nick?</font>

753
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:00,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you pick them up...
over in Washington Square?</font>

754
00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:02,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">The Village long-hairs are
peddling junk like that...</font>

755
00:52:02,515 --> 00:52:03,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">for the price of the canvas.</font>

756
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:07,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">These weren't painted by
any Village long-hair.</font>

757
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:09,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's my pawnshop, isn't it?</font>

758
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:12,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">And that snake is strictly from the Bronx.</font>

759
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:14,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">This fellow lives in Brooklyn.
He's famous.</font>

760
00:52:14,915 --> 00:52:17,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, what's his name?
- Well, I...</font>

761
00:52:17,115 --> 00:52:20,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nick, I've brought you stuff before
and you never asked for any name on it.</font>

762
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:25,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was jewelry. Bring me some more
of that and we can do business, Johnny.</font>

763
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:30,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take this junk back to Washington Square
where you got it.</font>

764
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:11,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see you've got an eye for art.</font>

765
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:13,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's one of my best.</font>

766
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:15,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Take a look at these...</font>

767
00:53:16,395 --> 00:53:18,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't know you were a painter.</font>

768
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:20,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not.</font>

769
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:26,610
<font color="#FFFFFF">Are they any good?
- Well...</font>

770
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:29,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">they've got something.</font>

771
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:31,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">A certain peculiar...</font>

772
00:53:32,555 --> 00:53:35,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">something. But no perspective.</font>

773
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:37,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Is that important?
- I should say it is.</font>

774
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look at my paintings.</font>

775
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:41,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where did you buy them?</font>

776
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't buy them,
I want to sell them.</font>

777
00:53:43,435 --> 00:53:45,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want me to sell them on commission?</font>

778
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:48,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">How much do you think they're worth?
- I always start everything at 25.</font>

779
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:52,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then... you know, it's a hard
business selling pictures.</font>

780
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">People don't buy art nowadays.</font>

781
00:53:55,155 --> 00:53:58,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">No appreciation, no taste,
no perception...</font>

782
00:53:58,195 --> 00:54:00,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">No perspective, huh?</font>

783
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let me have your name and address.</font>

784
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll come back later... So long.</font>

785
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:17,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Johnny.
- Hiya, Tiny.</font>

786
00:54:19,955 --> 00:54:21,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where'd you get that?</font>

787
00:54:23,115 --> 00:54:24,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Off Nick.</font>

788
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:26,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">What about my ring?</font>

789
00:54:27,035 --> 00:54:30,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how much a good diamond
costs? - I gave you 900 dollars.</font>

790
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:32,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Will you pipe down?</font>

791
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:43,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been telling me what a dope
the old guy is...</font>

792
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:45,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you're the dope.</font>

793
00:54:46,475 --> 00:54:49,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told you his paintings
are worth a lot of money...</font>

794
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:52,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Did you check up on his story?
- What's wrong with it?</font>

795
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:56,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">They're worth just 25 bucks apiece.
That's what's wrong with it.</font>

796
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy.</font>

797
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:02,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I weren't a gentleman...
- Well don't get sore.</font>

798
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:05,485
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well then don't tell me I'm crazy.</font>

799
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:13,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I tell you the old boy's a phony.</font>

800
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:15,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">His money isn't phony, is it?</font>

801
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">He could borrow dough, or
have it stashed away...</font>

802
00:55:18,155 --> 00:55:20,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Or even steal it.
- Chris steal?</font>

803
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeepers, Johnny, he's not the type.</font>

804
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:23,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wouldn't have nerve enough to steal.</font>

805
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:25,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well he didn't get it from his pictures.</font>

806
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:27,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">He may be dumb, but not about art.</font>

807
00:55:27,515 --> 00:55:29,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">The day he took me to the museum he
explained to me how everything was done.</font>

808
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:33,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">You should have heard him. People stood
around and listened.</font>

809
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:35,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">What museum?
- The Metropolitan.</font>

810
00:55:36,075 --> 00:55:40,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yipe. They've got pictures there
worth a million bucks.</font>

811
00:55:44,555 --> 00:55:46,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where you going?</font>

812
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:53,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to make a money
out of you, Lazy Legs.</font>

813
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:55,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't take his pictures to the museum.</font>

814
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:57,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who says I can't?</font>

815
00:56:11,915 --> 00:56:13,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know who bought them?</font>

816
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:16,786
<font color="#FFFFFF">Janeway. Damon Janeway.</font>

817
00:56:17,555 --> 00:56:19,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you know who Mr. Janeway is?
- No.</font>

818
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:21,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's an art critic.</font>

819
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:25,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">The best authority in New York
on Modern Art.</font>

820
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:27,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">He took one look and bought them both.</font>

821
00:56:27,515 --> 00:56:29,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't even give him my pictures.</font>

822
00:56:29,635 --> 00:56:30,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not for nothing.</font>

823
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:32,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wants to get hold of you.</font>

824
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:35,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me to telephone him.
You wait here, eh?</font>

825
00:56:35,355 --> 00:56:37,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no...</font>

826
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:53,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry...</font>

827
00:56:56,675 --> 00:56:58,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake, what's so funny?</font>

828
00:56:58,955 --> 00:57:00,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">You are, Smarty-Pants.</font>

829
00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:03,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the Mr. Fix-It who was gonna
make a monkey...</font>

830
00:57:03,955 --> 00:57:06,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">out of poor dopey little Kitty...</font>

831
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:09,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you gave away two pictures
for a couple of dimes...</font>

832
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:13,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now you can't collect the dimes.
- Oh dry up.</font>

833
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:16,389
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeepers.
- Now what?</font>

834
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">What am I gonna tell Chris?
- He won't find out.</font>

835
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:21,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">The heck he won't.
That Janeway's a crític...</font>

836
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">he writes for the newspaper.</font>

837
00:57:22,795 --> 00:57:25,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Golly, you got us in a spot.
I told you not to do it.</font>

838
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:26,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're just nervous.</font>

839
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:29,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">The old guy that sold them
doesn't know me from Adam.</font>

840
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:32,000
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me that drink, I can use it.</font>

841
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:38,393
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris?
- No, he's got a key.</font>

842
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:43,465
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well go ahead, see who it is.
Hurry up.</font>

843
00:57:54,515 --> 00:57:55,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">I beg your pardon, but...</font>

844
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:58,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">we're looking for a man,
and I'm afraid we don't know his name.</font>

845
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:01,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">And I'm afraid I can't help you.</font>

846
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:03,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry...</font>

847
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:05,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look.</font>

848
00:58:08,755 --> 00:58:10,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">There.</font>

849
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:14,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are his.</font>

850
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, there he is.</font>

851
00:58:17,395 --> 00:58:20,710
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you run away from me like that?</font>

852
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,072
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here, 50 dollars less 20 percent.</font>

853
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:25,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

854
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:27,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">But the pictures you brought me.</font>

855
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:30,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves:
My name is Janeway.</font>

856
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:32,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is Mr. Dellarowe.
- How do you do?</font>

857
00:58:32,195 --> 00:58:33,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">What is it you want?</font>

858
00:58:33,475 --> 00:58:36,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd like to find out
who painted the pictures.</font>

859
00:58:36,235 --> 00:58:38,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't know?
- Of course they don't know.</font>

860
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:40,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what we're here for.</font>

861
00:58:40,755 --> 00:58:42,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, if you're a friend of the painter,</font>

862
00:58:42,755 --> 00:58:44,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">you'll put Mr. Dellarowe in touch with him.</font>

863
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why'd you buy those pictures if you
didn't know who painted them?</font>

864
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:50,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because they're good.
- Who painted them?</font>

865
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:00,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Johnny, no.</font>

866
00:59:00,635 --> 00:59:02,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh don't be so modest, Miss March.</font>

867
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:04,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you see? You got me in bad.</font>

868
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:06,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">She made me promise not to tell.</font>

869
00:59:06,955 --> 00:59:10,440
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I made out like I didn't know.</font>

870
00:59:11,435 --> 00:59:13,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">She's funny about her painting.</font>

871
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:17,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never lets anyone see it. Doesn't
even put her name on her pictures.</font>

872
00:59:17,835 --> 00:59:19,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I observed.</font>

873
00:59:19,115 --> 00:59:20,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're an extraordinary artist,
Miss March.</font>

874
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:22,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, no.
- See?</font>

875
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:24,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">She can't stand for anybody
to talk about her.</font>

876
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:27,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">She got the idea her pictures
weren't any good.</font>

877
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why I took those two to you...</font>

878
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:32,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">to give her confidence...
I knew they were good.</font>

879
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I'll take that money.</font>

880
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:37,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never would have guessed
it was a woman.</font>

881
00:59:37,195 --> 00:59:39,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nor I... You're work is
very strong, Miss March.</font>

882
00:59:39,755 --> 00:59:42,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">May we see some more of it?
- Sure... go ahead.</font>

883
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:44,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look in her studio.
- Thank you.</font>

884
00:59:50,355 --> 00:59:52,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're crazy to try a thing like this.</font>

885
00:59:52,835 --> 00:59:54,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake,
I thought they were cops.</font>

886
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:57,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know what I'm doing...
they don't know from nothing.</font>

887
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't fool that crític.</font>

888
00:59:58,675 --> 01:00:01,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You always wanted to be an actress...
Now's your chance.</font>

889
01:00:01,155 --> 01:00:03,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been around the old boy
long enough to pick up his lingo...</font>

890
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:07,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Feed Janeway some of that... I'll get
him in here alone with you.</font>

891
01:00:07,195 --> 01:00:09,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, no... wait.</font>

892
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long has she been painting?</font>

893
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:17,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">Ever since she was a kid, Mr. Janeway.</font>

894
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Never went to art school, did she?
- No, she just picked it up...</font>

895
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:22,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess I'm the only one who's...</font>

896
01:00:22,595 --> 01:00:24,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">been encouraging her, kind of...</font>

897
01:00:24,635 --> 01:00:28,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Helping her along... as a friend...
You know, just a friend.</font>

898
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:31,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't get your name.
- Prince.</font>

899
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:37,388
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say Mr. Janeway... she's kind of upset.</font>

900
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,110
<font color="#FFFFFF">Maybe you'd go in and talk to her?</font>

901
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Be glad to.</font>

902
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, Mr. Dellarowe?</font>

903
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:56,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wonder if Miss March would
let me have all of these?</font>

904
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well that depends...</font>

905
01:00:59,395 --> 01:01:02,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's in it for her?</font>

906
01:01:02,155 --> 01:01:06,405
<font color="#FFFFFF">Prices will have to be built up,
Mr. Prince, but...</font>

907
01:01:15,975 --> 01:01:17,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can usually tell whether a canvas...</font>

908
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:20,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">has been painted by a man or woman...</font>

909
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you fooled me completely,
Miss March.</font>

910
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">Your work is not only original,
but has a masculine force.</font>

911
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,760
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long does it take you
to paint a picture?</font>

912
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:34,729
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a day... sometimes a year.</font>

913
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:38,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't tell, it has to grow.
- Of course.</font>

914
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's a matter of feeling, you know...</font>

915
01:01:40,855 --> 01:01:43,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">how feeling grows? It's like...</font>

916
01:01:44,295 --> 01:01:46,845
<font color="#FFFFFF">Like falling in love, I guess.</font>

917
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:50,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's a very good description.</font>

918
01:01:51,015 --> 01:01:55,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way I look at it... Every painting,
if it's any good, is...</font>

919
01:01:55,455 --> 01:01:57,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">a love affair.</font>

920
01:01:57,815 --> 01:01:59,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">May I quote that?
- Oh, no, no...</font>

921
01:01:59,695 --> 01:02:01,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Please don't write about me.</font>

922
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:04,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see you're going to be
a very hard case.</font>

923
01:02:04,255 --> 01:02:07,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why don't you have confidence
in your work?</font>

924
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:08,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Because I can't draw.</font>

925
01:02:09,055 --> 01:02:10,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">You do all right.</font>

926
01:02:10,495 --> 01:02:12,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just put a line around what I feel...</font>

927
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">when I look at things.</font>

928
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:18,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a very stimulating person to talk to.</font>

929
01:02:18,455 --> 01:02:21,005
<font color="#FFFFFF">How are you two getting along?</font>

930
01:02:21,895 --> 01:02:23,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I think I'm breaking the ice.</font>

931
01:02:23,255 --> 01:02:24,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty, Mr. Dellarowe wants to...</font>

932
01:02:24,895 --> 01:02:28,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">handle all your work exclusively...
Is it all right?</font>

933
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">As a friend I'd advise it.</font>

934
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could you come to the galleries tomorrow?</font>

935
01:02:32,095 --> 01:02:35,410
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time?
- Any time that's convenient.</font>

936
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:36,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">How about twelve o'clock?</font>

937
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then lunch afterward with me.</font>

938
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:41,324
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I...</font>

939
01:02:42,055 --> 01:02:44,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'll be there.</font>

940
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:48,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm glad you're around, Mr. Prince,
to make up her mind for her.</font>

941
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:50,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can see you're tired, Miss March.</font>

942
01:02:50,335 --> 01:02:51,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">This has been enough for one evening.</font>

943
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:53,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'd better go. Until tomorrow?</font>

944
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:56,490
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thanks, Mr. Janeway... so long.</font>

945
01:02:56,695 --> 01:02:57,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good evening.</font>

946
01:02:58,055 --> 01:03:01,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night, Mr. Dellarowe.
- Good night.</font>

947
01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:08,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Good night.
- Good night.</font>

948
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Lazy Legs...</font>

949
01:03:17,935 --> 01:03:19,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you told Janeway...</font>

950
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:20,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">but you've got him eating
right out of your hand.</font>

951
01:03:21,095 --> 01:03:22,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">It won't stop with lunch...</font>

952
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:25,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, what's the difference?
- If you mean...</font>

953
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:28,180
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, stop acting like a green kid.</font>

954
01:03:29,655 --> 01:03:33,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Let him talk about what he wants to
talk about, and he won't talk about art.</font>

955
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:36,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I had any sense I'd walk out on you.</font>

956
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">You haven't got any sense.</font>

957
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:58,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right here... just like you'd sign a letter.</font>

958
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on.</font>

959
01:04:01,975 --> 01:04:04,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Katherine March.
- Kitty?</font>

960
01:04:04,455 --> 01:04:07,600
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake... Put that one back.</font>

961
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:09,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty?</font>

962
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:15,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris. - Oh, Kitty,
I happened to be in the neigh...</font>

963
01:04:17,175 --> 01:04:20,247
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Mr. Cross, I just dropped in.</font>

964
01:04:20,335 --> 01:04:22,545
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought Millie was here.</font>

965
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:25,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, I hope you don't mind me
looking at your picture?</font>

966
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh no, not at all, Mr. Prince.</font>

967
01:04:28,455 --> 01:04:31,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fine work, that's remarkable painting.</font>

968
01:04:31,855 --> 01:04:33,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">You have a little trouble with
perspective, don't you?</font>

969
01:04:34,095 --> 01:04:38,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, that's one thing I could
never master: Perspective.</font>

970
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I guess I'll have to run along.</font>

971
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:42,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">So long, Mr. Cross.</font>

972
01:04:42,615 --> 01:04:44,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">If Millie drops in, tell her
I'll be at Tiny's place.</font>

973
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:47,745
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't bother, I'll let myself out.</font>

974
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:57,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Has he been here long?</font>

975
01:04:57,135 --> 01:04:59,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, why?</font>

976
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't like him. - Johnny's all right
He's a nice fellow, Chris. Really he is.</font>

977
01:05:02,095 --> 01:05:05,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know why you don't like him.</font>

978
01:05:05,255 --> 01:05:07,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well... was he the one?</font>

979
01:05:07,855 --> 01:05:09,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">One what?</font>

980
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:10,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well you said there was one man...</font>

981
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:12,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh for heaven's sake, won't you
ever forget that?</font>

982
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Was he?
- No.</font>

983
01:05:13,815 --> 01:05:15,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty...
- Go ahead and paint if you want to...</font>

984
01:05:15,135 --> 01:05:20,150
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to stick around if
you're going to torment me.</font>

985
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty...</font>

986
01:05:56,775 --> 01:05:58,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Kitty...</font>

987
01:05:58,335 --> 01:06:02,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, leave me alone,
I'm going out for dinner.</font>

988
01:06:05,175 --> 01:06:06,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty, don't be angry.</font>

989
01:06:06,655 --> 01:06:09,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why do you come here if you want to
quarrel? I didn't ask you to come here.</font>

990
01:06:09,295 --> 01:06:11,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, please Kitty.</font>

991
01:06:11,495 --> 01:06:13,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, for Pete's sake.</font>

992
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,969
<font color="#FFFFFF">Go and paint.
- I can't.</font>

993
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:19,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't do a thing when
you're angry with me.</font>

994
01:06:21,855 --> 01:06:23,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Do you want me to go?</font>

995
01:06:23,935 --> 01:06:26,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to stay here and paint.</font>

996
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:38,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris... I'm sorry, Chris, but...</font>

997
01:06:38,655 --> 01:06:41,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">why do you torment me about something
that's over and done with?</font>

998
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:43,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, because I...</font>

999
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,010
<font color="#FFFFFF">Would you marry me?
- You can't.</font>

1000
01:06:48,695 --> 01:06:50,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, something might happen.
- What?</font>

1001
01:06:50,815 --> 01:06:53,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better not let your wife
hear you talking like that.</font>

1002
01:06:54,015 --> 01:06:56,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Of course I'd marry you if
you were free, but...</font>

1003
01:06:56,695 --> 01:06:59,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're not, so... Let's not talk
about it. Now you go on and paint.</font>

1004
01:06:59,855 --> 01:07:01,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Could I paint you?</font>

1005
01:07:03,695 --> 01:07:07,350
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I was going to do this myself, but...</font>

1006
01:07:09,615 --> 01:07:11,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">Paint me, Chris.</font>

1007
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">There'll be masterpieces.</font>

1008
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:10,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Adele.</font>

1009
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:13,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">I dropped over to the butcher shop
like you told me to.</font>

1010
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:16,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">They got a nice piece of liver...</font>

1011
01:08:20,215 --> 01:08:23,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you
known Katherine March?</font>

1012
01:08:23,735 --> 01:08:25,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Answer me.</font>

1013
01:08:29,295 --> 01:08:33,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you're talking
about. - How long have you known her?</font>

1014
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well now, don't get excited,
let me help you off with your coat.</font>

1015
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:39,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're the one who's excited... Look
at you. And keep away with that knife.</font>

1016
01:08:39,455 --> 01:08:41,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">You want to cut my throat?</font>

1017
01:08:44,775 --> 01:08:47,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">How long have you known her?</font>

1018
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:50,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't know what you're talking about
- Don't lie to me.</font>

1019
01:08:50,735 --> 01:08:52,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've been copying her work for years.</font>

1020
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:54,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pretending you painted those pictures
out of your own head and all the time...</font>

1021
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:56,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">you were just copying the work
of a real artist.</font>

1022
01:08:56,975 --> 01:08:59,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll bet you're at Dellarowe's
every day making notes.</font>

1023
01:09:00,055 --> 01:09:02,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where?
- You know where.</font>

1024
01:09:02,135 --> 01:09:04,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dellarowe's Art Gallery in 57th Street.</font>

1025
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:08,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">They've got a window full of
paintings by Katherine March.</font>

1026
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:09,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're talking crazy.</font>

1027
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:13,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">She gets 500 dollars for a single
picture. She's a genius.</font>

1028
01:09:13,455 --> 01:09:15,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">No wonder I used to think sometimes...</font>

1029
01:09:15,335 --> 01:09:19,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">there was something in your work...
Now I know why.</font>

1030
01:09:19,575 --> 01:09:21,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you ever do any more
painting around here</font>

1031
01:09:21,255 --> 01:09:22,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">I swear I'll write that woman a letter...</font>

1032
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:26,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">telling her you're stealing her ideas.</font>

1033
01:09:26,255 --> 01:09:28,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a thief.</font>

1034
01:09:28,695 --> 01:09:34,985
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hogarth had better watch out... Or next
thing you'll be stealing his money.</font>

1035
01:09:39,295 --> 01:09:40,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not that one, Honey.</font>

1036
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:43,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dellarowe's asking for more pictures...</font>

1037
01:09:43,415 --> 01:09:45,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris just finished it, he'll miss it.</font>

1038
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:48,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Janeway says the new pictures are...</font>

1039
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:51,250
<font color="#FFFFFF">the best things you've done.</font>

1040
01:09:53,175 --> 01:09:55,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wasn't I right about Janeway,
Lazy Legs?</font>

1041
01:09:55,535 --> 01:09:57,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but he gets on my nerves.</font>

1042
01:09:57,295 --> 01:09:59,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I been out to dinner with him
three times this week...</font>

1043
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:02,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">and now he's talking about breakfast.</font>

1044
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's getting that look in his eye...</font>

1045
01:10:04,415 --> 01:10:06,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">All you gotta do is keep it there.</font>

1046
01:10:06,495 --> 01:10:08,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all very well for you to say...</font>

1047
01:10:08,735 --> 01:10:10,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">but what about the wear and
tear on my nerves?</font>

1048
01:10:10,895 --> 01:10:13,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Papa will take care of Kitty.</font>

1049
01:10:13,575 --> 01:10:16,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">Baby's gonna have a big diamond ring...</font>

1050
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:19,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a shiny limousine...</font>

1051
01:10:19,255 --> 01:10:21,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">and a penthouse.
- And Johnny?</font>

1052
01:10:22,615 --> 01:10:24,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">He goes with the penthouse.</font>

1053
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris...</font>

1054
01:10:40,055 --> 01:10:44,050
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did my pictures get into
Dellarowe's window?</font>

1055
01:10:47,135 --> 01:10:49,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Chris.</font>

1056
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,300
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't be angry with me...</font>

1057
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:55,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">No I'm not angry,
I just can't understand.</font>

1058
01:10:55,135 --> 01:10:56,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's not possible.</font>

1059
01:10:56,735 --> 01:10:58,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Forgive me, Darling, I...</font>

1060
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I needed money. They were
going to take the furniture back.</font>

1061
01:11:02,335 --> 01:11:03,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was humiliating...</font>

1062
01:11:03,815 --> 01:11:07,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I couldn't ask you for more,
you've been so generous.</font>

1063
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:11,444
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just couldn't.
So I sold some pictures.</font>

1064
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:14,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">To Dellarowe?
- Yes.</font>

1065
01:11:15,695 --> 01:11:17,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">You actually sold those pictures?</font>

1066
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:19,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes.</font>

1067
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:22,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know I shouldn't have
put my name on them but</font>

1068
01:11:22,935 --> 01:11:25,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Dellarowe wanted
to know who painted them...</font>

1069
01:11:26,055 --> 01:11:29,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I just couldn't give him your name.</font>

1070
01:11:29,255 --> 01:11:31,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I can't tell him different... can I?</font>

1071
01:11:32,015 --> 01:11:33,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1072
01:11:33,735 --> 01:11:38,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">The funny part is that it didn't seem
to make any difference.</font>

1073
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:42,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, well the funny part is it
made a great deal of difference.</font>

1074
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:44,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">If I'd brought those pictures
to a man like Dellarowe...</font>

1075
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:46,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">he wouldn't have taken them.</font>

1076
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a failure, Kitty.</font>

1077
01:11:48,135 --> 01:11:51,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, you're a great painter, Chris.</font>

1078
01:11:51,535 --> 01:11:55,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Dellarowe said so and
so did Mr. Janeway.</font>

1079
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:57,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">That is...</font>

1080
01:11:59,015 --> 01:12:02,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">they say I am.
- Well they're gonna keep on saying it.</font>

1081
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:04,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Chris.
- Oh now don't...</font>

1082
01:12:04,775 --> 01:12:06,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't Kitty, now don't cry.</font>

1083
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:08,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm happy...
Why, it's just like a dream.</font>

1084
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:11,847
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh Chris, you're so good, so kind.</font>

1085
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">What difference does it make whose
name is on those pictures...</font>

1086
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:15,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">yours or mine?</font>

1087
01:12:16,015 --> 01:12:18,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, it's just like we were married.</font>

1088
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:21,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only I take your name.</font>

1089
01:12:21,415 --> 01:12:25,665
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that gives me a little
authority around here.</font>

1090
01:12:26,215 --> 01:12:30,380
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want to paint your picture, Kitty.
How about it?</font>

1091
01:12:33,695 --> 01:12:35,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come with me.</font>

1092
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,910
<font color="#FFFFFF">Know what we're going to call this?
'Self-Portrait'.</font>

1093
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:06,643
<font color="#FFFFFF">DELLAROWE GALLERIES
EXHIBITION OF KATHERINE MARCH...</font>

1094
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:44,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Damon.
- Hello, Ned.</font>

1095
01:13:44,135 --> 01:13:45,355
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

1096
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:48,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well. This is the first time that
I've ever agreed with you, Janeway.</font>

1097
01:13:48,335 --> 01:13:49,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1098
01:13:49,495 --> 01:13:53,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I find the painter even more
fascinating than her paintings.</font>

1099
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:55,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's she like?</font>

1100
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:58,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mona Lisa without the smile...
Something hidden.</font>

1101
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:01,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes it seems as if she
were two people.</font>

1102
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:06,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I mention that in my notice...
would you care to see it?</font>

1103
01:14:25,095 --> 01:14:27,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cross, there's a man outside
who says he wants to see you.</font>

1104
01:14:27,975 --> 01:14:29,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who?
- I didn't get no name, sir.</font>

1105
01:14:29,695 --> 01:14:32,330
<font color="#FFFFFF">But he says he was a detective.</font>

1106
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:03,345
<font color="#FFFFFF">You the detective?
- Well, I used to be, Mr. Cross.</font>

1107
01:15:03,735 --> 01:15:05,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you recognize me?</font>

1108
01:15:06,655 --> 01:15:08,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">No.</font>

1109
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:13,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Homer.</font>

1110
01:15:13,335 --> 01:15:14,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quite a shock, huh?</font>

1111
01:15:14,935 --> 01:15:16,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now don't faint, Mr. Cross.</font>

1112
01:15:16,535 --> 01:15:19,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Keep your head.
I'll explain everything.</font>

1113
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:22,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I was in trouble at the time,
I'd been...</font>

1114
01:15:22,335 --> 01:15:25,995
<font color="#FFFFFF">collecting a little money from
the speakeasies along the waterfront.</font>

1115
01:15:26,095 --> 01:15:28,515
<font color="#FFFFFF">Word got around to headquarters.</font>

1116
01:15:28,615 --> 01:15:30,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">I was up for investigation.</font>

1117
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:32,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">One night I'm down by Brooklyn Bridge...</font>

1118
01:15:32,855 --> 01:15:34,835
<font color="#FFFFFF">trying to fix things up...</font>

1119
01:15:34,935 --> 01:15:36,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">A man runs into the speakeasy and says:</font>

1120
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:38,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">'A woman just jumped off the bridge.'</font>

1121
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:42,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">So I run out and tear off my coat,
jump in...</font>

1122
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:46,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way I felt, I'm hoping
I don't come up again.</font>

1123
01:15:46,415 --> 01:15:48,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">You mind?</font>

1124
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there I am, swimming
around in the dark...</font>

1125
01:15:57,655 --> 01:16:00,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I had hold of her hat once... the next
thing I know, I'm all tired out.</font>

1126
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I heard a tugboat whistle,
and right down on top of me...</font>

1127
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:05,849
<font color="#FFFFFF">comes a coal barge...</font>

1128
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">so I grab ahold and climb aboard.</font>

1129
01:16:08,415 --> 01:16:12,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I look down at my hand,
and what do you think I got?</font>

1130
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:13,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her pocketbook.</font>

1131
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:17,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's what I grabbed ahold of
when I thought it was her hat.</font>

1132
01:16:17,255 --> 01:16:21,294
<font color="#FFFFFF">And inside is 2700 dollars in folded money.</font>

1133
01:16:21,895 --> 01:16:26,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Imagine anyone committing suicide
with that much money.</font>

1134
01:16:26,135 --> 01:16:28,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well the coal barge unloaded
on a banana boat...</font>

1135
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:32,200
<font color="#FFFFFF">bound for Honduras...
Well, I went with it.</font>

1136
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:35,100
<font color="#FFFFFF">But if you're not dead...</font>

1137
01:16:36,055 --> 01:16:39,625
<font color="#FFFFFF">Then I'm not really married to Adele,
am I?</font>

1138
01:16:43,455 --> 01:16:45,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's it worth it to you for me to...</font>

1139
01:16:46,055 --> 01:16:48,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">keep my mouth shut and just...</font>

1140
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:50,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">fade away?</font>

1141
01:16:51,055 --> 01:16:52,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes but...</font>

1142
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you're Adele's husband...</font>

1143
01:16:55,575 --> 01:17:00,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wait a minute. I can see you need Adele.
I need money.</font>

1144
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're a cashier...</font>

1145
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">it ought to be easy for you to get
your hands on a couple of thousand...</font>

1146
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:10,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I... I... I couldn't do a thing like that.</font>

1147
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:14,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're going back to her?
- No.</font>

1148
01:17:14,735 --> 01:17:17,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">But not to do you a favor, Mister.</font>

1149
01:17:17,295 --> 01:17:20,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm clearing out for Adele's sake.</font>

1150
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">And don't think you're gonna get
any peace of mind, either.</font>

1151
01:17:25,055 --> 01:17:27,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">I might turn up again someday.</font>

1152
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:32,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">She'd kick you out in a minute
for a man like me.</font>

1153
01:17:34,895 --> 01:17:36,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll get you some money.</font>

1154
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:39,035
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now you're using your head.</font>

1155
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:40,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">But you'll have to wait here.</font>

1156
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can't get it until after we
close at six o'clock.</font>

1157
01:17:43,655 --> 01:17:45,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'll wait, Cross.</font>

1158
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:49,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Johnny. Hello, Kitty.
- Hiya, Marchetti.</font>

1159
01:17:49,815 --> 01:17:51,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hi.</font>

1160
01:17:52,975 --> 01:17:55,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't forget the champagne, Baby.</font>

1161
01:17:55,335 --> 01:17:58,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nice car you have, Johnny.
She go fast, eh?</font>

1162
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to see any cop trying to catch me.</font>

1163
01:18:00,735 --> 01:18:03,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Say, I'll give you four bits
for a bucket full of that ice...</font>

1164
01:18:03,335 --> 01:18:05,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Johnny.</font>

1165
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:12,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I borrow the icepick?</font>

1166
01:18:12,295 --> 01:18:15,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">You give it back, eh?
- Sure, sure.</font>

1167
01:18:17,255 --> 01:18:19,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Thank you.</font>

1168
01:18:21,975 --> 01:18:23,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Only 200?</font>

1169
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:26,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that's all I could get.</font>

1170
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:30,070
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't you think your wife's more than that?</font>

1171
01:18:30,615 --> 01:18:34,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Look, I want you to get all
that's coming to you, Mr. Higgins.</font>

1172
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:36,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now what about the insurance money?</font>

1173
01:18:36,735 --> 01:18:37,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">The insurance?</font>

1174
01:18:37,815 --> 01:18:40,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">2000 dollars... on your life.</font>

1175
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:44,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Adele collected it.
It's really yours, isn't it?</font>

1176
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:46,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">She keeps it right in her bedroom.</font>

1177
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:49,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Now I wouldn't touch a penny of it,
Mr. Higgins, but...</font>

1178
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:53,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">if you took it,
it would be perfectly legal.</font>

1179
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:56,945
<font color="#FFFFFF">But just how would I get it?
- That's easy.</font>

1180
01:18:57,655 --> 01:19:00,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is the night that she
always goes out to the movies.</font>

1181
01:19:00,855 --> 01:19:04,086
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let you in, you take the money...</font>

1182
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:07,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">I let you out.</font>

1183
01:19:08,695 --> 01:19:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why don't you get it?</font>

1184
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, I've got to be able to
say that I didn't touch it.</font>

1185
01:19:13,655 --> 01:19:15,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know Adele...</font>

1186
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:21,830
<font color="#FFFFFF">What if she don't go out...</font>

1187
01:19:22,135 --> 01:19:26,385
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I show up...
Your goose is cooked, isn't it?</font>

1188
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:28,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yes, but...</font>

1189
01:19:29,295 --> 01:19:31,570
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can play it safe.
- How?</font>

1190
01:19:32,495 --> 01:19:37,170
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, you come along the street
at 11 o'clock tonight...</font>

1191
01:20:24,175 --> 01:20:25,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay?</font>

1192
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,315
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why are you whispering?
How come the lights are out?</font>

1193
01:20:28,415 --> 01:20:32,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Michaels. You remember
Mrs. Michaels, don't you?</font>

1194
01:20:32,255 --> 01:20:34,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, yeah.
- And the neighbors.</font>

1195
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:43,195
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where is the money?</font>

1196
01:20:43,295 --> 01:20:47,205
<font color="#FFFFFF">In there... in the bottom drawer of the chest.</font>

1197
01:20:48,575 --> 01:20:51,040
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, give me the flashlight.</font>

1198
01:21:01,855 --> 01:21:03,635
<font color="#FFFFFF">Police.</font>

1199
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:05,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder.</font>

1200
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:07,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher.</font>

1201
01:21:07,335 --> 01:21:10,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">Christopher, turn on the lights.</font>

1202
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:37,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny.</font>

1203
01:21:38,215 --> 01:21:40,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Johnny.
- Lazy Legs.</font>

1204
01:21:40,255 --> 01:21:42,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeepers, I love you.</font>

1205
01:21:46,975 --> 01:21:48,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">What's that?</font>

1206
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:59,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris?</font>

1207
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:10,605
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny, is it Chris?
- Call him, quick.</font>

1208
01:22:11,535 --> 01:22:13,395
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

1209
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:14,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

1210
01:22:14,775 --> 01:22:16,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">I ought to push you over on your head.</font>

1211
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:19,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did I know he was coming here
tonight? I don't understand it.</font>

1212
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:21,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">You don't understand anything.
- But why get sore at me?</font>

1213
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well what are the use of my brains if
I'm tied up with a dumb cluck like you?</font>

1214
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:27,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">I told you to watch your step,
didn't I? - Right, blame it on me.</font>

1215
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:29,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh why did you keep me here tonight?
I didn't want to stay.</font>

1216
01:22:29,655 --> 01:22:31,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny. Don't talk like that.</font>

1217
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:33,915
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well it's the truth,
I'm fed up with you.</font>

1218
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,075
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny.</font>

1219
01:22:35,175 --> 01:22:40,530
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's the only thing you ever
understood, I'm through with you.</font>

1220
01:22:51,355 --> 01:22:53,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</I></font>

1221
01:23:01,515 --> 01:23:03,895
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</I></font>

1222
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:09,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh Lord, have mercy upon us sinners.</font>

1223
01:23:10,075 --> 01:23:13,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">The way of the sinner
is made plain with stones.</font>

1224
01:23:13,115 --> 01:23:16,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">But at the end thereof is the pit of Hell.</font>

1225
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:20,664
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner.</font>

1226
01:23:21,075 --> 01:23:24,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hallelujah. Amen.
- Hallelujah. Amen.</font>

1227
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:30,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Millie? Yeah, Kitty.
You seen Johnny?</font>

1228
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:35,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, I thought he'd go to Tiny's.
Was he getting tight?</font>

1229
01:23:35,595 --> 01:23:37,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, just a fight.</font>

1230
01:23:37,195 --> 01:23:38,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen, he can't live without me...</font>

1231
01:23:38,835 --> 01:23:40,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">any more than I can live without him.</font>

1232
01:23:41,035 --> 01:23:44,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Said he was coming back here?
To beat me up?</font>

1233
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:48,185
<font color="#FFFFFF">Jeepers, the way that guy
shoots off his mouth.</font>

1234
01:23:48,235 --> 01:23:51,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh you don't have to warn me,
that's just the way he talks.</font>

1235
01:23:51,355 --> 01:23:54,670
<font color="#FFFFFF">If you were in love you'd understand...</font>

1236
01:23:54,675 --> 01:23:57,905
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh stop it.
Johnny wouldn't kill a fly.</font>

1237
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:01,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's love, Honey.</font>

1238
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:05,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here he is now.
And has he got a bun on...</font>

1239
01:24:06,075 --> 01:24:07,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Goodbye, Hon.</font>

1240
01:24:07,595 --> 01:24:09,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Johnny.</font>

1241
01:24:12,155 --> 01:24:14,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, Johnny, I heard you.</font>

1242
01:24:26,675 --> 01:24:28,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">You lied to me, Kitty.</font>

1243
01:24:29,675 --> 01:24:30,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">It was him, wasn't it?</font>

1244
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:33,460
<font color="#FFFFFF">Can I help it if I'm in love?</font>

1245
01:24:34,315 --> 01:24:36,780
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, it's just an infatuation.</font>

1246
01:24:36,915 --> 01:24:40,400
<font color="#FFFFFF">You couldn't love a man like that, Kitty.</font>

1247
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">He's evil.</font>

1248
01:24:42,795 --> 01:24:46,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">He wouldn't let you alone,
isn't that right?</font>

1249
01:24:47,475 --> 01:24:49,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">I wanted to kill him.</font>

1250
01:24:49,635 --> 01:24:51,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">But it's wrong.</font>

1251
01:24:51,235 --> 01:24:53,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why did you come here?</font>

1252
01:24:54,795 --> 01:24:56,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">To ask you to marry me.
- And what about your wife?</font>

1253
01:24:56,955 --> 01:24:58,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I haven't any wife, that's finished.
- For cat's sake, you didn't...</font>

1254
01:24:58,995 --> 01:25:01,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">Her husband turned up, I'm free.</font>

1255
01:25:04,275 --> 01:25:06,948
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh now... don't cry, Kitty.</font>

1256
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:11,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know how you feel,
but that's all over now.</font>

1257
01:25:11,115 --> 01:25:15,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">We all make mistakes.
I don't care what's happened, I...</font>

1258
01:25:15,595 --> 01:25:17,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">I can marry you now, I...</font>

1259
01:25:17,475 --> 01:25:19,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want you to be my wife.</font>

1260
01:25:19,195 --> 01:25:22,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">We'll go away together,
away far off, so...</font>

1261
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:24,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can forget this other man.</font>

1262
01:25:25,195 --> 01:25:28,085
<font color="#FFFFFF">Don't cry, Kitty.
Please don't cry.</font>

1263
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not crying you fool, I'm laughing.</font>

1264
01:25:31,795 --> 01:25:33,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty...</font>

1265
01:25:33,955 --> 01:25:37,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?</font>

1266
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:39,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty...</font>

1267
01:25:42,955 --> 01:25:45,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've wanted to laugh in your face
ever since I first met you.</font>

1268
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">You're old and ugly...</font>

1269
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:50,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">and I'm sick of you.
Sick. Sick. Sick.</font>

1270
01:25:50,155 --> 01:25:51,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty, for Heaven sake.</font>

1271
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,329
<font color="#FFFFFF">You kill Johnny?
I'd like to see you try.</font>

1272
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:57,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">Why, he'd break every bone in your body.
He's a man.</font>

1273
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">You wanna marry me, you?</font>

1274
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:01,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get out of here. Get out.</font>

1275
01:26:01,475 --> 01:26:03,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from me. Chris. Chris.</font>

1276
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:05,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get away from me. Chris.</font>

1277
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:07,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

1278
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,104
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hey.</font>

1279
01:26:22,395 --> 01:26:26,560
<font color="#FFFFFF">You better look out, Johnny.
You'll kill somebody.</font>

1280
01:28:06,275 --> 01:28:08,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris.</font>

1281
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:35,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, Chris, wait a minute.</font>

1282
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">What made you do it, Chris?</font>

1283
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:42,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">When these officers called me,
I wouldn't believe it.</font>

1284
01:28:42,595 --> 01:28:45,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">We were tipped off on the telephone.
- By a man named Higgins.</font>

1285
01:28:45,515 --> 01:28:48,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I checked the cash before you came in.</font>

1286
01:28:48,675 --> 01:28:51,140
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know how much is missing?</font>

1287
01:28:51,715 --> 01:28:54,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Over 1200 dollars.
- We'll take him along.</font>

1288
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:55,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can make the complaint, Mr. Hogarth.</font>

1289
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:57,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hold on, Morris.</font>

1290
01:28:58,555 --> 01:29:00,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">I just can't do it.
- But Mr. Hogarth...</font>

1291
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:04,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">I know you've done your duty
and I'm obliged to you.</font>

1292
01:29:04,115 --> 01:29:06,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's a box of cigars on the table,
take them along with you.</font>

1293
01:29:06,795 --> 01:29:09,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">Okay, Mr. Hogarth, it's up to you.</font>

1294
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,680
<font color="#FFFFFF">Chris, it was a woman, wasn't it?</font>

1295
01:29:21,595 --> 01:29:23,595
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought so.</font>

1296
01:29:24,355 --> 01:29:26,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm not going to put you in jail, Chris...</font>

1297
01:29:26,675 --> 01:29:29,480
<font color="#FFFFFF">only of course you're through.</font>

1298
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:52,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well I didn't do anything.
I want a law...</font>

1299
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:54,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">I want a lawyer.</font>

1300
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,970
<font color="#FFFFFF">Where was he picked up?
- Riverside Drive.</font>

1301
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:59,520
<font color="#FFFFFF">He tried to get away in the
murdered girl's car.</font>

1302
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:01,620
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was my car.</font>

1303
01:30:04,195 --> 01:30:06,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">This is yours, too.</font>

1304
01:30:06,155 --> 01:30:10,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got your initials on it,
but it's her blood.</font>

1305
01:30:10,515 --> 01:30:13,335
<font color="#FFFFFF">Here's 140 dollars that was taken
out of her pocketbook.</font>

1306
01:30:13,435 --> 01:30:15,435
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was mine.</font>

1307
01:30:16,395 --> 01:30:20,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's her diamond ring, worth
5 or 600 dollars.</font>

1308
01:30:22,355 --> 01:30:24,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You guys know a lot, don't you?</font>

1309
01:30:24,715 --> 01:30:26,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It cost 1200.</font>

1310
01:30:27,595 --> 01:30:29,890
<font color="#FFFFFF">These are personal jewelry.</font>

1311
01:30:30,635 --> 01:30:33,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not much value, but he cleaned her out.</font>

1312
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:38,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">But why wouldn't I? She didn't
have any more use for it, did she?</font>

1313
01:30:41,955 --> 01:30:43,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Listen you guys, I want a lawyer.</font>

1314
01:30:43,115 --> 01:30:45,750
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm a citizen, I got my rights.</font>

1315
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">This belongs to you too, huh?</font>

1316
01:30:49,795 --> 01:30:51,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's got your fingerprints on it.</font>

1317
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well naturally, I picked it up.</font>

1318
01:30:53,675 --> 01:30:55,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">How did I know she was dead?</font>

1319
01:30:55,155 --> 01:30:58,130
<font color="#FFFFFF">I thought she was asleep, at first.</font>

1320
01:31:00,595 --> 01:31:02,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">She didn't paint those pictures.</font>

1321
01:31:02,955 --> 01:31:06,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">Old Cross isn't as dumb as he looks.
He painted them.</font>

1322
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">The accused brought me two pictures.</font>

1323
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:12,020
<font color="#FFFFFF">He told me Miss March painted them.</font>

1324
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:15,420
<font color="#FFFFFF">In my expert opinion, there's
no doubt about it...</font>

1325
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">She was a very great artist.</font>

1326
01:31:17,675 --> 01:31:18,820
<font color="#FFFFFF">She told me she was an artist...</font>

1327
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,730
<font color="#FFFFFF">when she rented the studio,
he was with her.</font>

1328
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:24,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't like him then
and I don't like him now.</font>

1329
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, he was mean when he was drunk.</font>

1330
01:31:26,595 --> 01:31:29,920
<font color="#FFFFFF">He said he was gonna fix her when
he left my place around 2 a. m.</font>

1331
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's when I tell him:</font>

1332
01:31:31,315 --> 01:31:33,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">'You look out, Johnny,
you're gonna kill somebody.'</font>

1333
01:31:33,515 --> 01:31:35,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">So he kills her with my icepick.</font>

1334
01:31:35,515 --> 01:31:38,220
<font color="#FFFFFF">And then I heard her say
'Hello, Johnny', before she hung up.</font>

1335
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,360
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was there, all right.</font>

1336
01:31:40,395 --> 01:31:42,720
<font color="#FFFFFF">But what I don't understand is this
talk about her being an artist.</font>

1337
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">I never saw her paint.</font>

1338
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:46,320
<font color="#FFFFFF">That was one of her peculiar traits:</font>

1339
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">She never let anyone see her paint.</font>

1340
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">I've compared her handwriting
with her signature.</font>

1341
01:31:51,155 --> 01:31:52,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's no question.</font>

1342
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:55,025
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cross paint?</font>

1343
01:31:55,555 --> 01:31:58,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">He only copied her work. He's a thief.</font>

1344
01:31:58,315 --> 01:32:02,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">He stole from me, from his employer,
from Katherine March.</font>

1345
01:32:02,395 --> 01:32:05,965
<font color="#FFFFFF">My wife, I mean my former wife,
is correct.</font>

1346
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,120
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really can't paint.</font>

1347
01:32:10,195 --> 01:32:12,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">My copies were so bad I
had to destroy them.</font>

1348
01:32:12,995 --> 01:32:15,290
<font color="#FFFFFF">For cat's sake. He's lying.</font>

1349
01:32:26,635 --> 01:32:28,865
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello, Mr. Cross.
- Hello.</font>

1350
01:32:29,475 --> 01:32:31,770
<font color="#FFFFFF">Tom Crocker, Evening Globe.</font>

1351
01:32:31,955 --> 01:32:33,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh yes, Tom Crocker.</font>

1352
01:32:33,795 --> 01:32:36,175
<font color="#FFFFFF">Joe Williams, Morning World...
Conway's with the Ledger.</font>

1353
01:32:36,275 --> 01:32:38,275
<font color="#FFFFFF">Hello.</font>

1354
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:40,475
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cigarette?
- No thanks.</font>

1355
01:32:40,635 --> 01:32:42,015
<font color="#FFFFFF">Going to Sing Sing?</font>

1356
01:32:42,115 --> 01:32:44,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah. I don't like to cover executions...</font>

1357
01:32:44,515 --> 01:32:46,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">but I must say this is one I don't mind.</font>

1358
01:32:46,595 --> 01:32:48,055
<font color="#FFFFFF">You sure cooked County's goose,
Mr. Cross...</font>

1359
01:32:48,155 --> 01:32:50,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">when you testified you couldn't paint.</font>

1360
01:32:50,675 --> 01:32:52,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">Nobody cooked County's goose
except Johnny...</font>

1361
01:32:52,315 --> 01:32:54,375
<font color="#FFFFFF">the way he shot off his mouth.</font>

1362
01:32:54,475 --> 01:32:57,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">He was a dead pigeon when he dragged
the girl's name through the mud.</font>

1363
01:32:57,755 --> 01:32:59,215
<font color="#FFFFFF">I watched the jury.</font>

1364
01:32:59,315 --> 01:33:02,255
<font color="#FFFFFF">If he'd kept his trap shut, he might
have got off with his life.</font>

1365
01:33:02,355 --> 01:33:03,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sure, the evidence was only circumstantial.</font>

1366
01:33:03,955 --> 01:33:06,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">What do you mean?
He got a fair trial, didn't he?</font>

1367
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,935
<font color="#FFFFFF">Yeah, but there's always a doubt.</font>

1368
01:33:09,035 --> 01:33:11,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I suppose you fellas are going to say
it was a miscarriage of justice.</font>

1369
01:33:11,995 --> 01:33:14,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">That someone is getting
away with murder?</font>

1370
01:33:14,515 --> 01:33:16,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Not me, there's no such thing.</font>

1371
01:33:16,635 --> 01:33:19,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mr. Cross, nobody gets away with murder.</font>

1372
01:33:19,675 --> 01:33:22,495
<font color="#FFFFFF">How's that?
- Oh, don't get him started.</font>

1373
01:33:22,595 --> 01:33:26,505
<font color="#FFFFFF">He'll talk your ear off,
that's his pet theory.</font>

1374
01:33:26,755 --> 01:33:28,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">All right, go ahead and laugh all you like.</font>

1375
01:33:28,795 --> 01:33:30,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">But no one escapes punishment.</font>

1376
01:33:30,715 --> 01:33:33,655
<font color="#FFFFFF">I figure we have a little
courtroom right in here:</font>

1377
01:33:33,755 --> 01:33:36,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Judge, jury and executioner.</font>

1378
01:33:37,435 --> 01:33:38,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">I don't get it.</font>

1379
01:33:38,915 --> 01:33:41,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Murder never solves anything,
how about it, fellas?</font>

1380
01:33:41,555 --> 01:33:42,615
<font color="#FFFFFF">You've covered lots of trials.</font>

1381
01:33:42,715 --> 01:33:44,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'm sorry, but I have to admit you're right.</font>

1382
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,855
<font color="#FFFFFF">The problem just moves in here
where it can never get out.</font>

1383
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,675
<font color="#FFFFFF">Right here in solitary. So what?</font>

1384
01:33:50,675 --> 01:33:52,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">So you go right on punishing yourself.</font>

1385
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:55,685
<font color="#FFFFFF">You can't get away with it. Never.</font>

1386
01:33:55,875 --> 01:33:57,695
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, that doesn't make any sense.</font>

1387
01:33:57,795 --> 01:34:00,575
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well you haven't seen as much of
murder as I have, Mr. Cross.</font>

1388
01:34:00,675 --> 01:34:06,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">I'd rather have the judge give me the
works than have to do it to myself.</font>

1389
01:34:09,475 --> 01:34:12,450
<font color="#FFFFFF">What time do they throw the switch?</font>

1390
01:34:13,955 --> 01:34:15,955
<font color="#FFFFFF">11 o'clock.</font>

1391
01:34:50,115 --> 01:34:52,735
<font color="#FFFFFF">I didn't do it,
I tell you I didn't do it.</font>

1392
01:34:52,835 --> 01:34:54,535
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't anyone believe me?</font>

1393
01:34:54,635 --> 01:34:56,775
<font color="#FFFFFF">Give me a break, somebody.
I never got a square deal in my life.</font>

1394
01:34:56,875 --> 01:35:00,445
<font color="#FFFFFF">Won't somebody,
somebody give me a break...</font>

1395
01:36:02,755 --> 01:36:04,135
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny.</font>

1396
01:36:04,235 --> 01:36:06,235
<font color="#FFFFFF">Johnny.</font>

1397
01:36:06,795 --> 01:36:08,795
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, Johnny. Johnny.</font>

1398
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:13,949
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs... </I></font>

1399
01:36:14,115 --> 01:36:16,535
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Johnny darling... Johnny darling... </I></font>

1400
01:36:16,635 --> 01:36:20,545
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>I'm here, baby...
Jeepers I love you, Johnny... </I></font>

1401
01:36:22,155 --> 01:36:24,155
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Johnny.</I></font>

1402
01:36:25,955 --> 01:36:28,788
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Lazy Legs, Lazy Legs... </I></font>

1403
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:31,787
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Jeepers I love you, Johnny... </I></font>

1404
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:58,065
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Oh Johnny, now we're together... </I></font>

1405
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:02,855
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Yeah... He killed me too, Kitty... </I></font>

1406
01:37:02,955 --> 01:37:05,615
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>He brought us together, Johnny... </I></font>

1407
01:37:05,715 --> 01:37:07,715
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Forever... </I></font>

1408
01:37:08,195 --> 01:37:09,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">Kitty...</font>

1409
01:37:09,555 --> 01:37:12,575
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Oh you idiot, how can a man be so dumb?</I></font>

1410
01:37:12,675 --> 01:37:14,415
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Kitty, no.</font>

1411
01:37:14,515 --> 01:37:16,735
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>You wanted to marry me? You?</I></font>

1412
01:37:16,835 --> 01:37:19,810
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>She's mine, Chris, mine... forever.</I></font>

1413
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,875
<font color="#FFFFFF">Leave me alone.</font>

1414
01:37:22,555 --> 01:37:25,975
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>You killed me, Chris, you're old
and ugly and you killed me... </I></font>

1415
01:37:26,075 --> 01:37:29,015
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>You killed me, you killed me,
you killed me.</I></font>

1416
01:37:29,115 --> 01:37:31,115
<font color="#FFFFFF">No, Kitty, it's him.</font>

1417
01:37:31,355 --> 01:37:34,815
<font color="#FFFFFF">You were innocent, you were pure, that's
what he killed in you. He's the murderer</font>

1418
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:36,895
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>No, he's not. Not Johnny.</I></font>

1419
01:37:36,995 --> 01:37:39,793
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>You see, Chris? She loves me... </I></font>

1420
01:37:40,075 --> 01:37:44,325
<font color="#FFFFFF">That's why you had to die.
You're the one I killed.</font>

1421
01:37:44,555 --> 01:37:46,555
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>She's mine, Chris.</I></font>

1422
01:37:47,515 --> 01:37:49,515
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>You kill Johnny?</I></font>

1423
01:37:49,555 --> 01:37:51,495
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>I'd like to see you try.
- Kitty... </I></font>

1424
01:37:51,595 --> 01:37:53,815
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>He'd break every bone in your body.
- Kitty.</I></font>

1425
01:37:53,915 --> 01:37:55,915
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>He's a man.
- Kitty.</I></font>

1426
01:38:08,675 --> 01:38:11,030
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Johnny... Johnny... </I></font>

1427
01:38:12,315 --> 01:38:14,783
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Oh, Johnny... Johnny.</I></font>

1428
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:20,855
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</I></font>

1429
01:38:27,275 --> 01:38:30,080
<font color="#FFFFFF">There's something wrong in there.</font>

1430
01:38:54,315 --> 01:38:57,715
<font color="#FFFFFF">It's all right old man,
it's all right...</font>

1431
01:38:57,715 --> 01:38:59,715
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Johnny.</I></font>

1432
01:38:59,755 --> 01:39:01,755
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Oh Johnny.</I></font>

1433
01:39:01,995 --> 01:39:04,375
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.</I></font>

1434
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:29,555
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get up, come on, get up, get up.</font>

1435
01:39:31,155 --> 01:39:33,155
<font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, it's you.</font>

1436
01:39:33,155 --> 01:39:34,975
<font color="#FFFFFF">Haven't I told you to keep out of this park?</font>

1437
01:39:35,075 --> 01:39:37,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">You know the Mayor's orders.</font>

1438
01:39:45,715 --> 01:39:49,370
<font color="#FFFFFF">Get on down to the Bowery,
where you belong.</font>

1439
01:39:49,755 --> 01:39:51,755
<font color="#FFFFFF">Come on, come on.</font>

1440
01:40:02,595 --> 01:40:04,295
<font color="#FFFFFF">Who's that rick?</font>

1441
01:40:04,395 --> 01:40:06,095
<font color="#FFFFFF">He has a crazy idea he killed
a couple of people...</font>

1442
01:40:06,195 --> 01:40:08,895
<font color="#FFFFFF">five or six years ago.
Can't get it off his mind.</font>

1443
01:40:08,995 --> 01:40:11,800
<font color="#FFFFFF">Always trying to give himself up.</font>

1444
01:40:12,995 --> 01:40:17,500
<font color="#FFFFFF">Wants to be tried and executed...
you know these nuts.</font>

1445
01:41:02,075 --> 01:41:04,880
<font color="#FFFFFF">Well, there goes her masterpiece.</font>

1446
01:41:10,595 --> 01:41:12,455
<font color="#FFFFFF">I really hate to part with it.</font>

1447
01:41:12,555 --> 01:41:17,825
<font color="#FFFFFF">For 10,000 dollars I shouldn't
think you'd mind, Mr. Dellarowe.</font>

1448
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:33,795
<font color="#FFFFFF"><I>Johnny.</I></font>
