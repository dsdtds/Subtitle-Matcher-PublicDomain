1
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,067
This day and age,
and we still have blackouts?

2
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,525
And there's no Wi-Fi either.

3
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,650
Who's there?

4
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Who's there?

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,858
Hey, this isn't funny.

6
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,317
Help! Help!

7
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,733
Get ready!

8
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:05,275
One, two, three.

9
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:10,885
Is it deep?

10
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,775
Hey, it's just sand, there are no rocks.

11
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:13,802
Is it cold?

12
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,067
Cold, cold, cold.

13
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,733
Wah, ha ha ha.

14
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,900
You're so timid.
Can you be braver next time?

15
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,942
Moron! Come here.

16
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:24,817
Okay.

17
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:27,025
Scared, huh? Scared

18
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:29,733
Hey, sorry, sorry.

19
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,233
Hey!

20
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:33,900
My god, are you blind?

21
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,400
It's your fault.

22
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:36,775
Why leave things in the middle?

23
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:38,233
Luckily it didn't get too far.

24
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,650
Oh, is it my fault now?
Clean it up right now.

25
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,400
You're so stern.

26
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,817
Why would anyone
want to get engaged to you?

27
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,358
- Take this.
- Okay, okay, okay.

28
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:50,317
Look at that cousin of yours.

29
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,067
She thinks I am bad at repairing cars.
I am good at it!

30
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,150
You pushed me just now?

31
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,733
Sir, we lost the GPS signal.

32
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,317
Do I go straight?

33
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,400
Yes, just follow the road.

34
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Yes, sir.

35
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,733
Where exactly is this college?

36
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,733
And aren't the students
on their semester break?

37
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:32,150
Do you teach there?

38
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,275
Yes.

39
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:54,358
Adli, Mom's calling. Adli.

40
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,733
Boboi!

41
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,692
Hey, don't you have another name?

42
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:04,567
That's the name of my cat back at home.

43
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,858
You don't want to answer Mum's call here.

44
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,233
While at home,
you cling to Mom all the time.

45
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,567
Alia, why did you call me Boboi?

46
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,358
I called your name because
you didn't respond. Mom's calling.

47
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,567
I'll return her call later.

48
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,733
What's there to call?
There's no coverage at the hostel.

49
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,233
Alia, there's Wi-Fi at the hostel.

50
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:27,567
Gang!

51
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,733
Let's pray before we head back.

52
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:34,608
I'll pray later at the hostel.

53
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:35,942
Liar.

54
00:05:38,983 --> 00:05:39,983
Hey!

55
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,442
Assalamualaikum, Mom.

56
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,650
Yes, Adli's here.

57
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,275
He's bathing at the river.

58
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:49,275
I just thought of bringing him
and his friends to play by the river.

59
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,650
Don't worry, Mom.

60
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,942
I'll look after him. Kak Fiza is here too.

61
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,983
Okay, Mom.

62
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:57,733
Bye!

63
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,233
I'm not ready.

64
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:01,483
Stop taking my picture.

65
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,817
They won't turn out good!

66
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,025
You don't have to be ready.
You always look good.

67
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,192
Okay no, no, one more time!

68
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,317
Okay, one more!

69
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,733
One!

70
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:09,677
Two!

71
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:10,692
Three!

72
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,358
Look!

73
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,025
Isn't it nice?

74
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,567
Yes, it's nice.

75
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,067
Kak Yam, what are you doing here?

76
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,692
Delivering food supplies.

77
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:34,608
Otherwise, what will the kids
who didn't go home eat?

78
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:35,858
They're all grown up.

79
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,650
They can take care of themselves.

80
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,025
Hey! Farid.

81
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,483
Did you hear?

82
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,968
Hear what?

83
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,400
About the village right behind.

84
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:46,650
Last week there was a fuss.
Some villagers got possessed.

85
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:47,983
The Silat boys got possessed!

86
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,275
There were seven of them.

87
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,317
Those Silat guys always go overboard.

88
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,733
- They were too engrossed.
- Hey, I'm serious here!

89
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:56,400
Their eyes turned all black.

90
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,983
Their sclerae disappeared.

91
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,567
Their faces turned pale!

92
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,108
Perhaps due to drugs.

93
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,233
No!

94
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:05,108
Enough.
I have to deliver food to the canteen.

95
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,192
Okay, Kak.

96
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:07,733
In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.

97
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:10,900
Oh Allah, oh my God,
please forgive our sins.

98
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:13,942
The sins of our parents,
the sins of our teachers.

99
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,275
Protect us from calamities.

100
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:17,733
I beg you, oh Allah.

101
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:19,567
Please extend the lives of our parents.

102
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,400
Please extend the lives of our teachers.

103
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:25,025
Forgive our sins
and distance us from adultery.

104
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,025
And all kinds of sins, little or great.

105
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,010
Ya Allah.

106
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,775
Answer me, oh, God.

107
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:37,900
Hurry up!

108
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,233
Adli, the smoke has to go
further that way!

109
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:43,025
Be patient! If you want it fast,
cook it yourself.

110
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,150
No, the problem now is

111
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,483
I asked you guys to pray,
but you guys lied!

112
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,468
That's right!

113
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,483
Great.

114
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:49,552
This is lying.

115
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,150
Hey, seriously, is the chicken enough?

116
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:52,442
I don't think it's enough.

117
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:53,427
Done.

118
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,192
Wow!

119
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:56,817
Eating alone, huh?

120
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,858
I asleep from waiting so long.

121
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:00,317
How could you do this to me?

122
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Blame them for late!

123
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:02,427
I cooked it myself.

124
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,692
Here, it's all done for you. I'm sorry.

125
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,733
Adli, you too.
Why you didn't learn to cook properly?

126
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:09,108
Sorry, Kak Fiza.

127
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,442
Now you're scared!

128
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,817
Hey, hey, where's Wari?

129
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:15,108
Wari.

130
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,775
I saw him over there just now.

131
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
- Wari.
- Huh?

132
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,650
Wari.

133
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:45,733
Wari!

134
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:50,358
Wari.

135
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:12,635
Are you done?

136
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,593
Yes.

137
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,817
Tomorrow morning I'll come at 5:00.

138
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,442
Don't you forget to wake up.

139
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,150
Don't worry, I'm a professional.

140
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,942
Teacher?

141
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,650
Kak Yam.

142
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,400
- Is Warden Harris around?
- Yes, teacher.

143
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,650
In the office, probably.

144
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:45,983
What happened to his hand?

145
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,608
He got into an accident!

146
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,650
He's still on leave, isn't he?

147
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,525
All right. I'll make my move.

148
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,817
Stay safe, Kak.

149
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Come in.

150
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,650
Nazmi!

151
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:07,483
Have a seat.

152
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Sorry.

153
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,733
I had to ask you come work early today.

154
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,233
It's all right.

155
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,733
There's nothing left for me at home.

156
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,525
Don't say such things, Mi.

157
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,900
Allah is testing you because

158
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:39,858
He loves you.

159
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,108
There must be a reason behind it.

160
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:43,692
Right.

161
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,900
A reason

162
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,650
which I couldn't find.

163
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,067
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

164
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,468
There.

165
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,817
How's your arm?

166
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,385
It looks bad.

167
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
No.

168
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:03,358
Broken.

169
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,733
Hey. Here.

170
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,817
List of students
who will stay here tonight.

171
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:13,983
Only 27 of them?

172
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,692
This is what I managed to get.

173
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,802
Hey!

174
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:18,802
Sorry again.

175
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:21,650
If it wasn't for the emergency
I wouldn't have called.

176
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,733
No worries.

177
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,108
I really wanted to work.

178
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:29,900
This is the key to the warden's room.
Stay there.

179
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,358
I only left few things there.

180
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,067
- Just my clothes.
- Okay.

181
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,317
One more thing.

182
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,650
For tonight's maghrib prayers
you'll be the imam.

183
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,275
Ask someone else to do it.

184
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,317
Hey, hurry up.

185
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,192
I want to go home.

186
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,275
Let's go, let's go.

187
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:49,692
Quick!

188
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,775
Quit messing around, I want to go home.

189
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,358
Now, okay.

190
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,608
- I'm going back.
- Okay, boss.

191
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:34,817
Now the gate is closed.

192
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,275
We're done for.

193
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,733
Relax, Sam.

194
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:40,192
It's just a gate.

195
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,400
Then how are you guys going in?

196
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,650
How about this, Kak?

197
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,483
We'll go back to the main road.

198
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:47,692
Drive us to the back.

199
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,775
Okay?

200
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:49,983
This is too much.

201
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,358
Kak. Stop, Kak.

202
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:02,692
- Here?
- Yes, here.

203
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:06,817
Hey, get on out.

204
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:12,025
Get on out?

205
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,900
Where to?

206
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,775
Sam, you're such a nerd.

207
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:19,400
I asked you to hang out
but you didn't want to.

208
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:20,608
Let's go.

209
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:26,942
Hey.

210
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,900
You'll heading back to KL?

211
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:30,442
No, the day after tomorrow.

212
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,483
Kak Miza has to meet the caterer tomorrow.

213
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,650
Oh.

214
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,400
Do you have some money, Alia?

215
00:16:38,483 --> 00:16:40,983
Now he's asking for money.

216
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,733
Where's your own money?

217
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,442
Kak, I've finished my money from PTPTN.

218
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,108
Did you spend it or did you waste it?

219
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,983
Of course I spent it,
what else could it be?

220
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,483
Here.

221
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,843
Thanks, Alia.

222
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,400
Oh dear.
Your brother is such a spoiled kid.

223
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,025
Kak, why are you being jealous?

224
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,275
Hey, when you guys are back in KL,

225
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,483
Give my regards to our parents and all.

226
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,150
- If God wills.
- Take care of yourself.

227
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,150
Take care, Kak.

228
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,108
Bye.

229
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:11,400
Bye, Boboi.

230
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,400
Hey, Wari.

231
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,983
What about the photos?

232
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,275
I'll email them later.

233
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,692
Send only the nice ones.
Otherwise, I don't want it.

234
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,567
Any photo with you in it is nice.

235
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,108
Go, they'll leave you behind.

236
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:28,358
Bye, Alia. Bye, Kak.

237
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,442
Bye.

238
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,858
All right, let's go.

239
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,858
I like Wari.

240
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:34,983
He's a sweet guy.

241
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:43,775
Hey,

242
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,233
What?

243
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:47,483
You like my sister, don't you?

244
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,733
What are you talking about?

245
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,692
Don't lie to me.

246
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,858
Even if I do like her,
what's your problem?

247
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:54,150
Big problem.

248
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,817
You would be my brother-in-law
out of nowhere, you know.

249
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:57,927
Bullshit.

250
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:58,942
Just open up.

251
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,817
Adli, help carry my bag.

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,302
Okay.

253
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:10,358
Right now.

254
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,900
We'll go past the teachers' office.

255
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,218
Wait.

256
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:16,525
Why don't we just walk along
the new block?

257
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:18,817
You're so dense.

258
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:21,025
Aren't we on semester break now?

259
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:22,525
The teachers have gone home.

260
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:25,010
Hey.

261
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:26,025
Hurry up.

262
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,233
Wari.

263
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:42,442
Wari.

264
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,442
Wari.

265
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:48,817
Hey.

266
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:50,108
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

267
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:51,358
Let's go.

268
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,025
Hey, one second.

269
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,192
Okay, let's go. It's nothing!

270
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,317
Just a prank.

271
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,385
How dare you prank me?

272
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,343
- Prank!
- One,

273
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,942
two, three, run!

274
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,983
Why are you guys leaving me behind?

275
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,260
Gang.

276
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,692
Whoever's the last is a monkey!

277
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,775
Sam is a monkey!

278
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,233
So, who's the monkey?

279
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:16,650
Sam.

280
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:18,567
He already looks like one.

281
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,108
Where are you coming from?

282
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:32,858
We came from…

283
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,692
We came from the surau.

284
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,775
Just finished prayers.

285
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,817
That's true, we came from the surau.

286
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:40,858
The student who was the imam
took attendance.

287
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,233
Your names weren't on it.

288
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:47,900
Maybe because there were too many of us.

289
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:49,317
He didn't notice us.

290
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,067
Many, huh?

291
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,733
Only seven people prayed at the surau.

292
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:04,442
Whose is this?

293
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,608
It's not ours, teacher.

294
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:09,108
Maybe belongs to someone else.

295
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:11,275
What other students?

296
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:13,692
They've all gone home.

297
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,650
You guys are the only ones here.

298
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,567
I don't know, teacher.

299
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,275
All I know is I don't smoke.

300
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:22,608
Neither do I.

301
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,150
Follow me.

302
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,400
See, I told you guys…

303
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:41,650
You guys are stubborn.

304
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,608
Ouch.

305
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:47,885
What's your problem?

306
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,192
Playing the blame game now?

307
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,525
You want to save yourself?

308
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,400
Chill, I got punished too, right?

309
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,150
Hey, gang.

310
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:57,733
Isn't Teacher Nazmi on a long break?
Why is he here working?

311
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,817
I saw his arm.
Did you notice there was a cast on it?

312
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,900
An accident?

313
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:03,302
Hey.

314
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:06,483
Forget about him. Why bother meddling in
other people's business?

315
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,983
Let's do our job.

316
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,067
Come on.

317
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:12,567
Wari.

318
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:14,733
Are you okay?

319
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:16,343
Okay.

320
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:17,483
I thought you had a fever.

321
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:20,760
Hey.

322
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,442
Clean this up, you guys.

323
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:25,150
You think I'm paying you guys for nothing?

324
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,067
Listen here.

325
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:28,593
I…

326
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,400
left a gift for you guys In the toilet.

327
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,233
The flush didn't work.

328
00:22:33,775 --> 00:22:35,525
- What are you waiting for?
- Pick it up.

329
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:36,900
I ain't picking it up.

330
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,317
You.

331
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:43,483
Don't play with soap, okay?

332
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,317
Why are you laughing?
As if you have never played with it.

333
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
What soap do you use?

334
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:53,483
This one.

335
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:26,942
I'm done.

336
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,067
There's no Internet.

337
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,525
Blackout.

338
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,067
How to update my vlog?

339
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,775
- Wait.
- What?

340
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,275
Oh, no, my phone
is running out of battery.

341
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,483
Same here, my phone is dying out too.

342
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,608
I don't have coverage either.

343
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,567
How am I supposed to call my mom now?

344
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,525
Serves you right. You disobeyed Alia.

345
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:09,442
Good for you. Suit with your name, Boboi.

346
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
You…

347
00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:13,025
Hey.

348
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,025
Teacher isn't around, is he? Let's leave.

349
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,733
Hey. Don't do that.

350
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:18,692
If teacher found out.

351
00:24:19,317 --> 00:24:20,692
We would be done for.

352
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,525
Let's finish this. Just a bit more.

353
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,192
- Come on.
- You're playing rough.

354
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,817
Wari. Wari. Wari.

355
00:25:15,525 --> 00:25:16,427
Wari!

356
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:19,358
Hey. Wari, are you okay?
Do you want some medicine?

357
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:21,858
I'm not feeling well.

358
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:24,608
Bring him to the dorm,
let him have some rest.

359
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,775
Let's go.

360
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:31,677
Get in.

361
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:33,067
Faster, get in.

362
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Lie down.

363
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,775
Oh my!

364
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,275
It feels so hot.

365
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,525
Why is he so feverish?

366
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:58,233
- It's really hot.
- Hot.

367
00:25:58,358 --> 00:25:59,900
I don't know what to do now.

368
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,525
Okay, never mind.

369
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:03,442
I'll go get some medicine from teacher.

370
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:04,733
You guys take care of him.

371
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:05,718
Okay.

372
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,067
Get some rest, Wari.

373
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:10,317
Hurry, Adli.

374
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:13,942
Wari.

375
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,233
What's wrong with you? You became so sick.

376
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:18,858
No idea. Could it be food poisoning?

377
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:19,843
It couldn't be.

378
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:21,900
Didn't we all eat the same thing?

379
00:26:58,608 --> 00:26:59,608
Teacher.

380
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:00,900
You gave me a shock.

381
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:01,968
What's the matter?

382
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:03,358
Got notice about power outage?

383
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:04,525
No, there wasn't.

384
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,608
Probably a blown fuse due to lightning.

385
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:09,858
Even if we call the technician
they would only arrive tomorrow.

386
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:12,067
I personally don't mind.

387
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,108
I'm worried the students might escape.

388
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:15,468
Don't worry.

389
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,650
I'll help keep an eye later.

390
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:28,233
Hey.

391
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,025
Teacher.

392
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,442
Didn't I ask you to clean the washroom?

393
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,525
No, teacher,
I came looking for you, teacher.

394
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:40,942
Wari has a fever.
I'm here for some medicine.

395
00:27:41,108 --> 00:27:42,567
Stop lying.

396
00:27:42,817 --> 00:27:45,358
I swear, teacher, Wari is sick.
I'm not lying.

397
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:47,858
Where's he?

398
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,567
At the dorm.

399
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,218
Wari.

400
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,567
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

401
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,650
What happened?

402
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,275
Wari.

403
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:23,775
Wari.

404
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:47,525
Wari!

405
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:50,025
Wari!

406
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:52,442
Nik.

407
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:53,775
Nik.

408
00:28:57,817 --> 00:28:58,817
Nik.

409
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:01,025
Nik.

410
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:02,718
Nik.

411
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:03,677
Wake up, Nik.

412
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,358
Hey., Nik!

413
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:06,442
Nik.

414
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,733
Place him over there.

415
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:17,983
Tell me what happened.

416
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Actually, teacher.

417
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,067
While cleaning the washroom,
Wari suddenly had a fever.

418
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:25,692
We brought him back to the dorm.

419
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:29,025
When we reached the dorm,
he became weird, teacher.

420
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:30,150
His eyes.

421
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:32,025
His face.

422
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,317
I don't know how to put it, teacher.

423
00:29:39,358 --> 00:29:41,608
What did your friend do
to become like this?

424
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,942
I don't know, teacher.

425
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,317
No idea.

426
00:29:57,483 --> 00:29:58,775
Whose phone has got coverage?

427
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:00,442
I have a phone, teacher.

428
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:02,192
But there's no coverage here.

429
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,858
Go to new block to get coverage.

430
00:30:03,942 --> 00:30:04,942
Even with that.

431
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,442
We can only get one bar.

432
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:07,692
We need to go there.

433
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:08,858
teacher.

434
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:10,650
What about Wari?

435
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,233
You are all my responsibility.

436
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,650
Let's deal with the phone first.

437
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:18,025
Look after him.

438
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:33,025
Why do we have to stay here?

439
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,317
We have to look after, Nik.

440
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,817
What if Wari comes?

441
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,525
What are you going to do?

442
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,483
Just let teacher handle everything.

443
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:33,692
This dorm right here?

444
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,567
Go get coverage.

445
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,150
Once you've made the call,
go to the warden's room.

446
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,525
Okay, teacher.

447
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:22,275
The students are still awake.

448
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,483
Where is the coverage?

449
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,317
What's going on?

450
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:05,108
Why are you still awake?

451
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,067
Hey.

452
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,525
What are you doing here?

453
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:13,942
Hey.

454
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,567
What's wrong with you?

455
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:18,983
Hey, are you okay?

456
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:47,733
Teacher! Help, teacher!

457
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:49,275
Teacher!

458
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,593
What are you doing?

459
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,510
Open door for him.

460
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:52,983
You moron! It could be Wari!

461
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,067
You're the moron.
Wari doesn't sound like that.

462
00:35:55,525 --> 00:35:56,427
Teacher!

463
00:35:56,442 --> 00:35:57,942
What if he's pretending, Kechik?

464
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,442
Don't dig your own grave!

465
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,510
What then?

466
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,427
Just ignore him?

467
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:02,442
Teacher, help!

468
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:37,275
Food has been dealt with.

469
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:38,983
I only have one problem left.

470
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:40,260
Flowers.

471
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,942
Do you want roses or lilies, Alia?

472
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:46,858
Alia.

473
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:49,275
Hello, Alia.

474
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,150
What's wrong?

475
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:58,608
I have a bad feeling.

476
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:07,608
Adli?

477
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,150
Alia. Alia.

478
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:13,400
Alia, you've to get back here now.

479
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,108
Hello, Adli.

480
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,942
Alia. Alia, we're in danger.

481
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:18,733
You need to get back here, please.

482
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:20,025
Hello.

483
00:37:20,233 --> 00:37:21,135
I can't hear you.

484
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,483
Alia, listen here.

485
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:24,483
Wari is sick.

486
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:25,942
Get back here right now!

487
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:27,942
Adli, what gibberish are you talking?

488
00:37:28,025 --> 00:37:29,025
Alia.

489
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:30,218
Alia, please.

490
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:32,192
We're in danger, you have to come.

491
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:33,358
Danger?

492
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:34,483
What sort of danger?

493
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:35,567
Hello.

494
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,317
Alia. Alia.

495
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:39,358
Adli.

496
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:40,733
Hello.

497
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:29,733
Wari.

498
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:34,608
Wari.

499
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,608
I couldn't get through.

500
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,067
Kak Fiza.

501
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:25,775
I feel that something's wrong.

502
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:28,650
What exactly is wrong?

503
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,358
Because Adli said Wari fell sick.

504
00:39:33,108 --> 00:39:35,650
He was just talking nonsense.

505
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,317
But that's what Adli said.

506
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,525
Okay, so? What?

507
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:42,775
Whatever Adli says, you just believe?

508
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,567
He was just pulling your leg.

509
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:46,817
No.

510
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:49,317
I know Adli.

511
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:53,608
I know what he's like when lie,
or when he is serious.

512
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,275
Kak Fiza.

513
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,483
I think Adli is in danger.

514
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,733
We need to turn back right now.

515
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,150
It's me.

516
00:41:30,733 --> 00:41:31,733
Adli.

517
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,025
Hey.

518
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,358
I seek forgiveness from Allah.

519
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,067
Are you okay?

520
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:47,067
Wari.

521
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,067
Wari changed.

522
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,525
I saw his face.

523
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,650
I don't know how to describe this.

524
00:42:02,817 --> 00:42:04,150
I stabbed him.

525
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:09,733
Is he dead?

526
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,858
I'm not sure.

527
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:16,525
Where's teacher Nazmi?

528
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,108
He isn't back yet?

529
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,400
No.

530
00:42:21,983 --> 00:42:23,442
We split up earlier.

531
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,108
He went to look around.

532
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:27,483
At the seniors' block.

533
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:31,733
Nik.

534
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,067
Nik.

535
00:42:38,733 --> 00:42:39,942
Where are we?

536
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:41,343
What happened?

537
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,358
Are you okay?

538
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,525
I don't know.

539
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:47,942
My head is pounding like a drum.

540
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:48,968
I feel dizzy.

541
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,817
We've to get Nik to the hospital.

542
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:52,483
Where's Wari?

543
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:57,177
Adli.

544
00:42:57,192 --> 00:42:58,733
Did you call the ambulance?

545
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:00,775
I couldn't. My cellphone broke.

546
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:02,817
Then who's coming to save us?

547
00:43:03,275 --> 00:43:04,817
But I was able to call Alia.

548
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,442
Let's wait here.

549
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:09,400
Maybe she'll arrive in a while.

550
00:43:32,692 --> 00:43:33,692
Teacher.

551
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:45,358
Teacher.

552
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:47,400
What happened?

553
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:50,358
I was attacked.

554
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:54,650
By a student.

555
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:03,442
His face!

556
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:12,025
His face…

557
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:29,733
Kak Yam…

558
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,900
Kak Yam told me
the nearby village been possesed.

559
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:36,942
Possessed?

560
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,650
Possessed.

561
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:42,650
What do we do, teacher?

562
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,983
There are students in my room.

563
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,567
Let's meet up with them.

564
00:44:50,317 --> 00:44:51,483
And we'll make a plan.

565
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:57,067
I thought of the students
who went hysterical.

566
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,942
The hysteria must have spread in some way.

567
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,775
How does it spread then?

568
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:02,608
I don't know.

569
00:45:03,483 --> 00:45:06,358
But I don't think
it spreads through air or infection.

570
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:09,525
Because we wrestled with Wari earlier,
but nothing happened.

571
00:45:11,858 --> 00:45:13,525
Wari bit you just now, didn't he?

572
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:17,983
How could it spread through biting?

573
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:24,233
Sir!

574
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:26,108
Sir!

575
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,733
Where is the guard?

576
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:31,983
Why is the dorm pitch black?

577
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:33,567
I was right.

578
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,650
Adli called because something went wrong.

579
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:37,525
Kak Fiza, we must get inside.

580
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:40,733
Okay let's go.

581
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:45,483
Wait.

582
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:47,275
Does she have the key?

583
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:50,858
How is your sister going to enter here?

584
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:52,733
You're right.

585
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:55,608
It isn't that difficult. Just open it.

586
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:56,858
Where's the key?

587
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:00,275
Usually, the guard

588
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:02,733
puts it in the booth.

589
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:06,400
I think we've to open the gate now.

590
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,900
But isn't it dangerous out there?

591
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:11,900
It's okay, Sam, I can go alone.

592
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:18,858
Never mind, I will follow you.

593
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:20,150
Nik,

594
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,733
look after Sam.

595
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,150
Let's go.

596
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,900
Give me your phone.

597
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:31,358
My battery is low.

598
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,400
It's fine.

599
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:33,608
Let's go.

600
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,817
Look, there are lights!

601
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,775
Do you think it's Farid or…

602
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:34,400
It's okay, Kechik.

603
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:36,317
We'll go have a look.

604
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Let's go.

605
00:48:45,942 --> 00:48:47,025
Chik, Chik! Wait.

606
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:02,192
Do you see them?

607
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:03,275
No.

608
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:14,650
Adli.

609
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,608
Hey, are you okay?

610
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:20,733
Kechik.

611
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,900
I think I can't go back with you guys.

612
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:26,233
What are you talking about?

613
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:29,692
We're going back to the warden's room now
and we'll treat you.

614
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:31,483
You know, don't you…

615
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:35,150
what will happen to me?

616
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:41,317
Adli. Come in, come in.

617
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Kechik.

618
00:50:00,442 --> 00:50:02,483
Once my sister arrives…

619
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:07,025
you take Nik to the hospital.

620
00:50:08,025 --> 00:50:09,400
What about you?

621
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,135
Adli!

622
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,275
Hey, hey!

623
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:17,400
Adli! Adli!

624
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:18,858
Close the door!

625
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,900
Teacher.

626
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,733
Did you ask for anyone's help?

627
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,233
Earlier I asked the students
to call for help.

628
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,317
How long does the power outage
last usually?

629
00:52:23,733 --> 00:52:24,733
I don't know.

630
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:29,150
There must be something that we can do.

631
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,817
This place used to be powered
by a generator.

632
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,775
It's still there.
But I don't know if it is still working.

633
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:46,817
We have to try starting the generator.

634
00:52:47,733 --> 00:52:49,858
How? I don't know how. I'm not good at it.

635
00:53:07,608 --> 00:53:08,608
Kak Fiza!

636
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:12,233
Blood.

637
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:19,233
Kak Fiza, look.

638
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,900
There's someone over there.

639
00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:26,567
Hey, kid.

640
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:27,927
Hey, kid.

641
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:29,358
We're looking for a student here.

642
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:31,025
His name is Adli. Do you know him?

643
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:33,900
Who's that, Kak Fiza?

644
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:36,525
- Kak Fiza!
- Alia! Alia! Alia!

645
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:42,900
Run, Alia! Go!

646
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:44,983
Alia!

647
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:46,942
Alia! Wake up! Wake up! Alia!

648
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:53,942
Alia!

649
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:55,275
Run!

650
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:03,942
Run Alia!

651
00:54:04,025 --> 00:54:05,817
Run! Run!

652
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,802
Alia! Alia!

653
00:54:06,817 --> 00:54:09,150
Hey! Hey! Hey!

654
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:11,608
Teacher.

655
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,692
Teacher! Let's go!

656
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:22,692
My bag! My bag! My bag! My bag!

657
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,317
What are you doing?

658
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:25,775
Run! Alia!

659
00:54:40,983 --> 00:54:41,983
Hey!

660
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:43,733
Who are you people?

661
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:45,025
I…

662
00:54:45,108 --> 00:54:46,900
am the sister of a student here, Adli.

663
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,692
He called for help just now.

664
00:54:48,775 --> 00:54:49,775
Do you know him?

665
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:52,525
Yes.

666
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,650
He is already at the warden's room.

667
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:56,900
Wait! Wait!

668
00:54:57,442 --> 00:54:59,900
What was wrong with that student just now?

669
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,802
Why?

670
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:03,983
We have no idea either.

671
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:07,442
But right now we've to go back
to the warden's room.

672
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:09,635
Let's go.

673
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,858
Hey, hurry up! Faster! Faster!

674
00:55:22,942 --> 00:55:23,942
Alia.

675
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,442
Where's Kechik?
He couldn't have left me behind, could he?

676
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,358
Relax, Sam.

677
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:07,567
You make me depressed.

678
00:56:12,025 --> 00:56:13,025
Teacher.

679
00:56:16,108 --> 00:56:17,108
Kak Fiza! Alia!

680
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:18,233
Sam?

681
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,177
Where's Adli?

682
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:21,317
Adli and Kechik went to open the gate.

683
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,343
You didn't see them?

684
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:24,608
Hey, the gate key is with me.

685
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:26,983
Who's that?

686
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:29,525
Alia! Kak Fiza!

687
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:31,733
Kechik!

688
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:33,442
Where's Adli?

689
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,442
I asked where's Adli?

690
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:42,900
Tell us.

691
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,525
Tell us what happen.

692
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,692
Adli became just like Wari.

693
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:51,108
No!

694
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:54,942
Adli!

695
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:59,483
Alia. Alia. Look at Kak Fiza.

696
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:07,400
Didn't I tell you and Adli
not to leave the room?

697
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,025
Stubborn. Look what happened to Adli.

698
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:11,900
- You moron!
- Can you just shut up?

699
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:13,733
Shut up?

700
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:15,817
What I said is true.

701
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:18,650
- If he were careful…
- You're wrong!

702
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:21,358
Adli is our friend.
Be considerate of their feelings!

703
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:25,233
Earlier you saw a student asking for help.
Why didn't you help?

704
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,942
I had to ensure, Nik's safety.

705
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:31,150
Was it his safety or your safety
that you wanted to ensure?

706
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:34,275
Cut it out!

707
00:57:38,567 --> 00:57:39,692
Fiza, where did you park?

708
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:43,067
I parked at the place
where I dropped you guys earlier.

709
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,650
Can we all fit in your van?

710
00:57:46,608 --> 00:57:47,858
The key is in the bag.

711
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,052
Bag?

712
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:51,900
We've to get it from the student
at the football field.

713
00:57:57,442 --> 00:57:58,733
Does anyone have a phone?

714
00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:05,927
There's no coverage.

715
00:58:05,942 --> 00:58:07,233
No coverage in this area.

716
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,442
So there's no internet either.

717
00:58:09,525 --> 00:58:10,692
Go to a higher place.

718
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:13,692
What do we do now?

719
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:15,858
We need to learn
about the things out there.

720
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:17,567
They're savage, teacher.

721
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,067
I saw it with my own eyes.

722
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:24,317
When they were gathering at the field.

723
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:28,067
I think Wari is their leader.

724
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,150
They can seemingly communicate
with each other.

725
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,233
One more thing.

726
00:58:34,692 --> 00:58:36,150
Their eyes.

727
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:39,233
They can't look at light.

728
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:41,650
Are you sure about the generator?

729
00:58:41,733 --> 00:58:42,733
I'm sure!

730
00:58:42,858 --> 00:58:44,650
But I don't know if it is still working.

731
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,400
Wait. There's a generator?

732
00:58:46,483 --> 00:58:47,483
Yes.

733
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,858
Show it to me. Perhaps I can fix it.

734
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:51,442
Do we have a toolbox and petrol?

735
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:52,468
Yes, we do.

736
00:58:52,483 --> 00:58:53,468
At the workshop.

737
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:54,983
- Let's go!
- Wait.

738
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:01,858
Let's split up.

739
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:07,858
Farid, bring Fiza to the generator.

740
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:08,942
Sam.

741
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,358
You and Kechik…

742
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:12,650
head to the workshop.

743
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:13,817
Look for some petrol,

744
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,067
take the toolbox and meet up
with them at the generator.

745
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:18,567
Teacher.

746
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:19,942
Hey, wait.

747
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,983
Is it okay to split up?

748
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:25,067
It will be easier for them to spot us
if we move in a big group.

749
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,150
Okay.

750
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,025
Cellhone.

751
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,692
What do you want to do?

752
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:34,983
I've to go get coverage
at the upper floor.

753
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:37,358
I want to tag along. I can help.

754
00:59:39,483 --> 00:59:40,483
No way.

755
00:59:40,817 --> 00:59:42,108
You have to stay here.

756
00:59:43,817 --> 00:59:46,150
But this is my phone. I want to tag along.

757
00:59:58,858 --> 00:59:59,858
Nik.

758
01:00:00,692 --> 01:00:04,567
As long as it isn't done, don't go out,
you got it?

759
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:01,567
Wari.

760
01:01:04,025 --> 01:01:05,900
I am sorry, Wari.

761
01:01:07,233 --> 01:01:08,358
I am sorry.

762
01:01:08,442 --> 01:01:10,483
I'm so glad you are still alive, Wari.

763
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:13,858
Don't worry, Adli, I'm fine.

764
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:15,733
Wari.

765
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:18,942
But I am in pain, Wari.

766
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:22,650
I'll bring you to a world
without suffering.

767
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,525
Close your eyes, Adli.

768
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:26,817
Trust me.

769
01:01:28,108 --> 01:01:29,733
Follow me, Adli.

770
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,983
Hurry. We're almost there.

771
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:05,108
There, the generator shed.

772
01:02:06,942 --> 01:02:07,942
Let's go.

773
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,817
Here! Here!

774
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:15,358
Let's go.

775
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:17,775
Come on! Come on!

776
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:18,858
Go! Go! Go!

777
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,052
Take this.

778
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,067
Faster.

779
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:31,067
Whiere is the key?

780
01:02:38,733 --> 01:02:40,275
It's stuck! It's stuck!

781
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:43,218
Go inside

782
01:02:43,233 --> 01:02:44,233
Come inside

783
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:57,067
You…

784
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:17,317
How is it going? Can you fix it?

785
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,567
Probably yes.

786
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:21,233
I learnt about this model back then.

787
01:03:22,317 --> 01:03:25,275
Anyway we have to wait for Kechik.

788
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:27,108
All right.

789
01:03:28,983 --> 01:03:29,983
You!

790
01:03:30,192 --> 01:03:31,093
Here.

791
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:32,108
What's this?

792
01:03:32,483 --> 01:03:33,817
I'll wait for Kechik.

793
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:36,858
Whatever happens, don't go out.

794
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:26,025
Sam! Take this.

795
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:53,233
Sam!

796
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,400
Sam!

797
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,650
Sam!

798
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:32,275
Let's go!

799
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:43,567
Here.

800
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:16,358
Nik! Open the door, Nik!

801
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:18,567
Nik!

802
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,608
Sam! What's the matter?

803
01:06:24,692 --> 01:06:25,733
Where's Kechik?

804
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:28,942
Kechik died.

805
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:31,608
Are you serious?
Don't joke around with me.

806
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:34,108
It's true, Nik. I saw it with my own eyes.

807
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:36,233
He was trapped at the workshop.

808
01:06:37,025 --> 01:06:40,192
I think that right now
we need to go to the secret entrance.

809
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:41,650
We've to get Kak Fiza's van.

810
01:06:41,733 --> 01:06:43,442
Didn't they lose their keys at the field?

811
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:44,567
What do we do now?

812
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:49,608
We need to leave this place, Nik

813
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:51,025
We need to go to the highway.

814
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:52,150
Let's get to main road.

815
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:53,650
We must get help, Nik.

816
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:56,900
What about Teacher Nazmi, Alia, Kak Fiza?
Is that all?

817
01:06:56,983 --> 01:06:58,942
We must get out of here, Nik.

818
01:06:59,317 --> 01:07:01,192
Otherwise we will all die here, Nik.

819
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:08,608
Please, Nik. Let's get out, Nik.

820
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,692
Let's escape from here, Nik.

821
01:07:32,858 --> 01:07:33,858
Handphone

822
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:56,858
Got a signal?

823
01:08:08,983 --> 01:08:09,983
Adli

824
01:08:13,525 --> 01:08:14,525
Adli.

825
01:08:16,733 --> 01:08:17,733
Hey!

826
01:08:19,525 --> 01:08:20,567
Are you all right?

827
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:24,775
Adli,

828
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:44,733
Teacher!

829
01:08:45,942 --> 01:08:47,483
Adli. Adli, don't!

830
01:08:47,942 --> 01:08:50,483
Adli! don't! Adli!

831
01:09:03,233 --> 01:09:04,233
Adli.

832
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,150
Alia's here.

833
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,275
It's me, Alia! Adli!

834
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,067
Alia! Alia!

835
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:18,067
- Alia!
- Alia?

836
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:28,733
Alia!

837
01:09:33,525 --> 01:09:34,525
Adli!

838
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:38,718
Alia!

839
01:09:38,733 --> 01:09:40,692
Adli! Adli! Adli!

840
01:09:41,108 --> 01:09:43,483
Alia! Alia! Alia!

841
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:46,900
Please.

842
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,650
Take care of Mom and Dad.

843
01:09:49,733 --> 01:09:51,108
Promise me, Alia.

844
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:53,900
I promise, I promise.

845
01:09:53,983 --> 01:09:57,233
But you've to keep fighting, Adli.
Please keep fighting.

846
01:10:12,525 --> 01:10:15,150
Adli!

847
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:21,358
Adli!

848
01:10:29,483 --> 01:10:30,733
We must go now.

849
01:10:30,817 --> 01:10:33,942
Alia! We must go now!

850
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:35,358
Let's go!

851
01:10:53,067 --> 01:10:54,067
Over here!

852
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:50,900
Okay, our secret entrance is there.

853
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:54,650
What now? What do we do?

854
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,942
I will count to three.

855
01:11:59,025 --> 01:12:01,858
We run together, and don't ever stop.

856
01:12:03,233 --> 01:12:04,135
Okay.

857
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,135
One,

858
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,150
two,

859
01:12:06,233 --> 01:12:07,233
three!

860
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:12,942
Sam! Sam! Sam!

861
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,650
Sam! Help me, Sam! Sam!

862
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:35,108
Get lost! Get lost!

863
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:39,567
Teacher!

864
01:12:40,317 --> 01:12:41,317
Adli!

865
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,025
Kechik!

866
01:14:10,775 --> 01:14:12,733
Kechik! Run, Kechik!

867
01:14:12,817 --> 01:14:14,192
Faster, Kechik! Faster!

868
01:14:14,275 --> 01:14:15,275
Kechik!

869
01:14:16,525 --> 01:14:17,468
Kechik, faster!

870
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:18,483
Hey, Farid!

871
01:14:18,525 --> 01:14:19,525
Get in Kechik!

872
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:28,108
Kak Fiza!

873
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:40,775
Harder, Kak Fiza!
Harder, Kak Fiza! Harder!

874
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:43,108
Harder!

875
01:15:34,942 --> 01:15:35,942
Let's go!

876
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,233
This way. Hold this.

877
01:15:49,608 --> 01:15:50,608
Teacher!

878
01:15:50,692 --> 01:15:51,692
Get in! Get in!

879
01:16:13,317 --> 01:16:14,317
Help me!

880
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,775
Kak Fiza. How can I help?

881
01:16:54,858 --> 01:16:58,108
Do you know
what a crank handle looks like?

882
01:16:58,317 --> 01:16:59,317
Yes, I know.

883
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,817
Okay, Kechik, please help. Thank you.

884
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:21,942
What else should we do, teacher?

885
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:24,067
We've to wait for the generator.

886
01:17:26,067 --> 01:17:27,608
Can we make it, teacher?

887
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,942
What if we can't make it?

888
01:17:31,025 --> 01:17:32,900
I hope we can make it till dawn.

889
01:17:57,108 --> 01:17:58,442
Nazmi.

890
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,608
Who are you?

891
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,150
It's me, Wari.

892
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:22,775
I'm here to help you.

893
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:27,733
Follow me, Nazmi.

894
01:18:28,733 --> 01:18:30,025
Follow me.

895
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,233
You won't feel any pain.

896
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,317
Your suffering will end.

897
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:38,525
Follow me, Nazmi.

898
01:18:40,275 --> 01:18:41,275
Hey.

899
01:18:44,108 --> 01:18:45,692
My pain…

900
01:18:46,858 --> 01:18:49,608
my life, what do you know about them?

901
01:18:50,108 --> 01:18:52,942
I know about your children.

902
01:18:53,733 --> 01:18:55,650
About your wife.

903
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:58,608
Isn't this world unfair?

904
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,858
What sins have you committed?

905
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:05,942
Why did he do this to you?

906
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,275
Follow me, Nazmi.

907
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:24,067
Teacher.

908
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,442
What happened to your family?

909
01:19:33,692 --> 01:19:35,900
Dear, what do we do now?

910
01:19:36,942 --> 01:19:38,608
You told me you would be coming back.

911
01:19:40,983 --> 01:19:42,775
I was going to give you a surprise.

912
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:44,067
Surprise?

913
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,150
What surprise?

914
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:46,567
What surprise do you want?

915
01:19:47,233 --> 01:19:49,567
Dad! Let's go to the zoo, shall we?

916
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:51,108
Let's watch movies.

917
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,900
I want to bring you to the funfair!

918
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:56,733
Yes.

919
01:19:57,317 --> 01:19:58,442
Dear,

920
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,400
it'll be fun.

921
01:20:01,025 --> 01:20:02,608
But won't you feel tired?

922
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,858
I'm not doing this all the time.

923
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:15,108
Every day I ask God.

924
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:20,692
Why?

925
01:20:23,858 --> 01:20:27,067
Why it wasn't me who died that day?

926
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:37,817
Sarah.

927
01:20:39,942 --> 01:20:40,927
Honey!

928
01:20:40,942 --> 01:20:42,025
- Dear.
- Honey!

929
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:43,817
Honey! Sarah!

930
01:20:46,483 --> 01:20:49,192
Forgive me. Forgive me.

931
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:51,983
My dear.

932
01:20:52,442 --> 01:20:53,775
I am okay.

933
01:20:54,692 --> 01:20:55,900
Don't worry.

934
01:20:57,692 --> 01:20:59,650
Our kids are waiting for us.

935
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,108
Follow me, Nazmi.

936
01:21:26,817 --> 01:21:28,025
Teacher! Teacher!

937
01:21:28,108 --> 01:21:30,983
My dear, don't worry. Follow me, Nazmi

938
01:21:31,317 --> 01:21:35,650
Our kids are waiting for us, my dear.
Follow me, Nazmi.

939
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,567
Follow me, Nazmi.

940
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,067
My dear.

941
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,900
The kids are waiting for you.

942
01:21:42,442 --> 01:21:43,567
Dear.

943
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:45,942
Follow me, Nazmi.

944
01:21:46,483 --> 01:21:48,817
Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!

945
01:22:31,025 --> 01:22:32,775
Teacher. Teacher.

946
01:22:33,358 --> 01:22:34,358
Teacher.

947
01:22:36,483 --> 01:22:37,775
You go.

948
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:42,775
But we can leave together, teacher.

949
01:22:45,775 --> 01:22:46,775
I…

950
01:22:49,108 --> 01:22:50,358
Soon…

951
01:22:51,317 --> 01:22:53,233
I will be like them.

952
01:22:56,483 --> 01:22:57,483
Hey.

953
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,150
Remember your promise to Adli.

954
01:23:37,108 --> 01:23:38,108
Thank you.

955
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,400
Please.

956
01:23:46,733 --> 01:23:47,733
Wait, Kechik.

957
01:23:47,775 --> 01:23:48,942
I'm trying.

958
01:23:51,358 --> 01:23:52,525
Why is it acting this way?

959
01:23:53,442 --> 01:23:54,442
Wait.

960
01:23:56,025 --> 01:23:57,608
I don't know why.

961
01:23:58,567 --> 01:23:59,692
Wait, wait.

962
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:33,900
Allah, there is no deity except Him

963
01:24:33,983 --> 01:24:36,692
the Ever-Living, the Sustainer

964
01:24:36,775 --> 01:24:39,358
of all existence.

965
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:41,650
Neither drowsiness
overtakes Him nor sleep.

966
01:24:41,733 --> 01:24:43,608
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens

967
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:45,067
and whatever is on the earth.

968
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:48,733
Who could possibly intercede with Him,

969
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:50,650
except by His permission.

970
01:24:50,733 --> 01:24:53,442
He fully knows what is ahead of them

971
01:24:53,525 --> 01:24:55,817
and what is behind them.

972
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:58,233
And they encompass not a thing

973
01:24:58,317 --> 01:25:00,817
of His knowledge, except

974
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,775
for what He wills to reveal.

975
01:25:03,858 --> 01:25:07,525
His Kursi encompasses

976
01:25:07,608 --> 01:25:08,942
the heavens and the earth.

977
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,692
And it is not difficult for Him

978
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:13,817
to preserve them.

979
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,983
And He is the Highest

980
01:25:17,067 --> 01:25:20,025
and the Greatest.

981
01:27:26,942 --> 01:27:29,733
Follow me, Nazmi.

982
01:29:23,233 --> 01:29:28,108
A fire that took place at a hostel
has killed more than 20 people.

983
01:29:28,192 --> 01:29:30,442
The police are still
investigating the cause.

984
01:29:30,525 --> 01:29:32,192
The public are advised

985
01:29:32,275 --> 01:29:36,400
not to spread any false information
and false news on social media.

986
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:37,983
Three victims were saved

987
01:29:38,067 --> 01:29:41,358
while another badly injured victim
is being treated at a hospital.

988
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:45,192
Nonetheless, their identities
have yet to be confirmed.
