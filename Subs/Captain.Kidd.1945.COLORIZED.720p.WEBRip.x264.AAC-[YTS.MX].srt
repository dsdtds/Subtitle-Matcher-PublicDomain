3
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,259
Madagascar.

4
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,262
For centuries
the bloodiest cockpit of all the seas.

5
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,681
Where
the infamous Brotherhood of the damned.

6
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,515
The weight of the plunder.

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,518
The treasure laden galleons
from India and Cathay.

8
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:05,231
Then returned drunk with slaughter
for their pirate stronghold of last hope.

9
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,277
Most ruthless of all
was Captain William Kidd.

10
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,115
He encountered the great London galleon,
the 12 Apostles, commanded by Admiral Lord

11
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:18,912
Blaine, and approaching unsuspected
in the guise of a peaceful merchantman.

12
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:23,124
By a sudden touch of a salad bowl,
he was just turned to a burning hulk.

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,837
When night fell,
the 12 Apostles was only a blazing

14
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,424
funeral pyre
on the surface of a Madagascar lagoon.

15
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,761
Stop me!

16
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,971
There's a pretty side.

17
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,348
Reproduce during the fire.

18
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,974
Reaches the magazine.

19
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,351
Put it all.

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,144
Lots of stout seamen among them.

21
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,146
And with us a long time we can.

22
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,565
None of us live forever, Mr. Boyle.

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,318
Dead men don't talk man your own.

24
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,695
We got this job to build before high tide.

25
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,163
There and dig past the tide.

26
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,831
Catch his head or save the king's hangman.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,834
Some rope.

28
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,760
Hell, yeah.

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,679
Deep enough to bury him at it.

30
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,182
Give us a happy

31
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,641
all ready, captain.

32
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,644
And she goes.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,444
What are you waiting for, little captain?

34
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,779
That just been in cabin the longest time.

35
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,574
And we all thought is how it wouldn't
do no harm to open up that chest,

36
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,577
make sure that what was in it,
then, isn't it? Now?

37
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,955
I suppose you remember what was in it.

38
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:30,084
I remember an emerald necklace
that came off the Portuguese ship of anger

39
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,339
and all those pearls that we took from
the big ship, the Virgin Queen.

40
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,427
I remember a diamond medallion we got from
that Moorish canyon of Madagascar.

41
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,764
And could we ever forget
that silver casket with the arms of Lord

42
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:46,267
Blaine that you claimed yourself
after the taking of the 12 apostles, sir,

43
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,729
your necklace
stretched as long as your memory.

44
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,732
One of these days.

45
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,373
And. Satisfied.

46
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,250
Gallows meat.

47
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,253
Put them back.

48
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,268
Long away.

49
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,577
No matter.

50
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,997
The laminate. Cat and mouse. You forgot.

51
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,414
What are you.

52
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,833
What now? We've got half an hour
of all the tide trap.

53
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,334
That just may be, sir.

54
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,753
We're all equal in this,
I take it. Equal shares.

55
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,799
Yes, well, I key then what you put back in
your belt that goes down with a chest.

56
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,759
Thus we starts all clear.

57
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,761
No favors.

58
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,138
Some of us don't get back.

59
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,307
It'll be that much easier. Open for them
has done.

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,975
Question me on it again, would you?

61
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,978
I'll rip you from Belgian Chine.

62
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:32,957
Always such

63
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,711
callous rascals
that we leave a dead comrade

64
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
without commending
his soul to his new master.

65
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,471
Here lieth

66
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,266
one who, through treachery and avarice,

67
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,187
would have placed in jeopardy
the lives of honest men.

68
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,940
And here may he live forever.

69
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,943
And the sands of Madagascar.

70
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,988
Rest in peace.

71
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,491
It's time to be out of that.

72
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,494
It's time to be away.

73
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,806
From.

74
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,683
If a gentleman is a gentleman, he's
a gentleman.

75
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,227
That's all there is to it, sir.

76
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,437
I want a native gentleman,
but I need polish.

77
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,399
My good man, if I'm to improve myself.

78
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,358
Gentleman employs

79
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,195
the terminology, my good men,
only when addressing lower servants.

80
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,030
Or is inferior, sir.

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,033
You see, that's why I need you.

82
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,702
My upbringing,

83
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,746
gentlemen. Never such as tea, sir.

84
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,707
Many a man's social career
has been ruined by lesson.

85
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,793
You seem to know your business.

86
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,753
I want the best man and I can pay for it.

87
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,423
Hundred quid a yet

88
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,051
an infallible mark
of the person of quality is his reluctance

89
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,179
to pay his domestics
high wages that say so many

90
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,182
an idiosyncrasy of good breeding, sir.

91
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,519
Â£60 here,

92
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,022
then you realize I've never been on board
a ship before, sir.

93
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,067
I don't let that frighten you
to the contrary.

94
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,280
In fact, since I was a nipper,
I've had rather an adventurous inclination

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,492
toward life on the bound in Maine,
which had been quite educational. Sir.

96
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,662
You learn a lot, no doubt.

97
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,205
Is it a bargain, then?

98
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:36,789
But it was.

99
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,792
I had my hand on it.

100
00:07:40,501 --> 00:08:29,884
Oh. Oh. Oh.

101
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,223
Then it is your proposal,

102
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,226
my lord Belmont, the Captain Kidd

103
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,729
sailed to meet our ambassador
Lord forthwith and give him a safe

104
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,357
conveyance with a parrot.
What is of Madagascar?

105
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,400
May I please, Your Majesty? Yes.

106
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,571
That needs a bold and adventurous man.

107
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,990
Bring in this, Captain Kidd. Why?

108
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,993
We take the measure of him.

109
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,500
And William Kidd.

110
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,386
Your Royal Majesty

111
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,722
and I will, Lord.

112
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,599
Belmont.

113
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:22,019
Is this your roaring killer of Spanish
buccaneers?

114
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,731
Me. Me, lad,
I am only a peaceful ship master.

115
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,734
Who must you trade with other ships
without inquiring too closely

116
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,069
about that business.

117
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,945
And it was so.

118
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,365
I fell into the hands of the 12 apostles,
a king ship

119
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,368
turned pirate in Madagascar waters.

120
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,204
I have never been in Madagascar.
What is your Grace?

121
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,498
It was off the southern tip of Africa.
What?

122
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,501
I had gone to trade in elephants teeth.

123
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,503
Who commanded her?

124
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,880
One of your admirals, your Majesty.

125
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,883
You name of Lord Blaine?

126
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,593
He did.

127
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,596
Had pirate been sufficiently lad

128
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,558
to put fear in honest traders like myself.

129
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,019
And if you are successful in

130
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,939
this voyage, captain,
what reward do you expect made?

131
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,066
Please,
Your Majesty, having forfeited me to him

132
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,987
that I was supposed
to strike me to a pirate, I want no reward

133
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,574
but to regain it
in the service of Your Majesty.

134
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,284
Unless it be.

135
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,495
Or is it to that Lord Blaine's

136
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,457
lands are restricted and his titles
forfeit?

137
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,126
Yes, all.

138
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,712
All I ask is that if I lay this

139
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,715
renegade nobleman by the heels.

140
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,261
Is that you honor
the humble self with his castle

141
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,264
and his lands.

142
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,352
Is that all you want, Captain Kidd?

143
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,940
Not a pardon more, Your Majesty, whom
the fellow treats of a title so lightly.

144
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,612
He must be bursting with noble blood,
though I confess he keeps it well hidden.

145
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,155
I say,

146
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,283
you can no more judge of a man
by his appearance, than you can judge

147
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,536
the extent of a nobleman's brains
by the expansiveness of his wit.

148
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,582
Am I to suppose

149
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,585
that the captain of the king's
God would deign to fence

150
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,214
with me?

151
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,177
Come, captain.

152
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,180
Is your courage less than your wit nicer?

153
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,392
I know nothing of fence.

154
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,896
You must come at me
quickly, as though you'd kill me.

155
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,066
Very well, then.

156
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,945
I ask pardon, sir.

157
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,612
I have a hot head.

158
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,032
When roused, I only meant to demonstrate,
and to good purpose.

159
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,035
Captain.

160
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,875
Your Majesty is satisfied
with the captain of our choosing.

161
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,294
I can think of none better.

162
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,256
I thank you, sir.

163
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,551
And now, captain,

164
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,554
the main mission of your cruise
will be to meet a great ship,

165
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,349
a merchant, which is sailing from India
with vast treasures

166
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,686
and to give us safe conduct in my name,

167
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,439
past the pirate waters of Madagascar.

168
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:16,110
But, Your Majesty, will her commander
accept my letter of sufficient authority

169
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,653
to. You? Shall have a letter to what?

170
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,947
Ambassador
Lord Portsmouth was returning home.

171
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,074
But he is to accept

172
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:26,245
your protection
and to submit to all matters

173
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,582
pertaining to the safety of the ship
and her treasures.

174
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,334
I oh,

175
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:36,672
and now, sire may crew your crew.

176
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,677
Captain Kidd wishes to recruit a crew
from the Pirates, now under capital

177
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,680
sentence in Newgate and the Marshal, sea

178
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,725
a crew of condemned pirates.

179
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,435
I sir

180
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,230
this none would be so loyal,
nor quite so desperate

181
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,442
as cutthroats under sentence of death,

182
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,445
if they knew that at the end of the voyage

183
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,782
a royal pardon would be in their pockets.

184
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,078
But I shall hold you accountable for that
good conduct between their conduct

185
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,165
and mine, your Majesty,
there will be little to choose.

186
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,710
And now, goodbye.

187
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,588
And Godspeed you.

188
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,508
I am but his unworthy sparrow.

189
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,999
And every

190
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,670
few and rather ether bills
come from an African slaver.

191
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,339
Adam, don't let that temper
get you the lash again.

192
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,841
If I must hang, I'll hang.

193
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,260
But I'll go to the gallows
with clean guts, at least.

194
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,135
Hey, you!

195
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,555
What kind of stinking
maggots meat is this?

196
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,806
What is it?

197
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,307
There's a dainty crumb. Mercy.

198
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,018
Complaining about the taste of the king's
bounty again.

199
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,644
Watch it.

200
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,895
Basie, fight me.

201
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,023
I the king's allowances trumpets
a day for food, not muck from the soil.

202
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,317
Is the white chapel making trouble again?

203
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:24,488
I ain't mercy, I'm asking only
what a man's legally entitled to hear.

204
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,491
Smell this.

205
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,911
Delicious.

206
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,882
I don't want anything I can

207
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,676
hear your guv'nor.

208
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,595
What sort of a kingdom is this?

209
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,806
Well, a man's condemned before
he's heard and style before they hang him.

210
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,184
Who was that
quarrelsome fella? At a mercy.

211
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,187
He was taken in a pirate ship
by His Majesty's frigate wasp.

212
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,480
He's always escaping.

213
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,524
So that's why we keep him in chains.

214
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,860
He's got a lacing of tiger's blood in him.

215
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,324
Who isn't exactly a flower.

216
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,617
God knows it.

217
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,701
Oh, forgive me, governor.

218
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,994
These are two of me officers.

219
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,330
Mr. Boyle, governor Landers, Mr.

220
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,333
Lorenzo, governor Landers.

221
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,085
Spanish blood.

222
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,963
A pretty lot of sinners could be done.

223
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,881
Do you think that he's.

224
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,716
Anyone down there knows us?

225
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,887
I hope not, I've no doubt you'll be good
enough to tell him what we're here for.

226
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,974
Give heed, you, you vermin.

227
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,770
Here's news to get advantage
as the hangman that day.

228
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,063
Oh, to that then, Jack.

229
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:39,939
Nasty face.

230
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,191
Is that that your mother's turned
into an honest woman?

231
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,360
Silence your mutinous dog.

232
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,905
If another man speaks, I'll trace him up
by the Thames and play him raw.

233
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,283
Governor,

234
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:55,621
is that the way to win the love of these
unfortunate gentlemen?

235
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:02,294
Now, then, me bullies, would you rather do
the gallows dance and hang in chains.

236
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,381
Till the crows
pick your eyes from your rotting skulls?

237
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:10,803
Oh, would you feel a roll of a stout ship
beneath your feet again?

238
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,180
I I'm a vessel.

239
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,518
The adventure galley
and the king's commissioned a sailor.

240
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,813
And for those who shall a loyal
and a stout heart.

241
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,691
That are royal pardon in the offing.

242
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,318
Have I.

243
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,530
Which of you knows the waters
off Madagascar?

244
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:30,698
Are you?

245
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,160
Would you have him unlocked the.

246
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,704
Water.

247
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,707
Unlock him.

248
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,291
Look you.

249
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,088
Then I want men with iron in their blood
and stealing their sinews.

250
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,884
And the first up here is the first
enlisted governor of your waters already.

251
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,595
Would you be good enough
to have them lower the ropes, Lord.

252
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,598
Away!

253
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:04,440
Own. Oh!

254
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,113
Yeah.

255
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,116
They come back where they land.

256
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,583
Where your hands are

257
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,586
that I'll make you free. Man.

258
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,467
Go on now.

259
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,805
Next.

260
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,611
Month.

261
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,741
Name it a shot.

262
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,825
Need either shout.

263
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,453
Regardless of the fact
that I'm your captain,

264
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,456
you will always address
a gentleman who serves scum.

265
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,959
I say make your mark.

266
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,259
On board.

267
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,886
Name that of my sister.

268
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,889
Oh, so it's you.

269
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,265
Mercy!

270
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,935
That's a comical handle
for a blade of fortune.

271
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,144
Mercy?

272
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,231
It's also something
the world needs more violent death.

273
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,483
A philosopher. You speak cultured.

274
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,486
Well, are you by any chance
stable boy to a noble house?

275
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,445
Perhaps.

276
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,032
I was also a master gunner to a buccaneer.

277
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,035
You may have heard of Captain Avery,

278
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,122
Avery's master gunner.

279
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,541
We've made him a master, Mr.

280
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:45,874
Boyle.

281
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,294
And from what I've heard,
Avery was a shrewd hand at picking him.

282
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,047
The berths?

283
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,466
Yours for as long as you can handle it.

284
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,135
I can handle it.

285
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,427
Swivel gunner. Long time.

286
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,305
I've offered a guinea for every mess
for which your neck.

287
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,308
If you miss while you're on my ship,
I come up.

288
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,065
And you can write.

289
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,943
We'll give you a nice bath.

290
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,697
You'll draw a uniform
befitting the master gunner on board.

291
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,365
Next man.

292
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,200
Name Bartholomew Blevins.

293
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,244
salamu.

294
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,413
Livings

295
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,416
make him up.

296
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,633
Down below.

297
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,389
Oh. Like it?

298
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,975
Every day.

299
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,936
I don't want any other.

300
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,605
I don't want anything.

301
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,816
No more war.

302
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:53,984
You know, Vanessa.

303
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,826
Thanks, man.

304
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,202
That's all.

305
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,205
Sir, compliments for.

306
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,958
Oh, me?

307
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,126
I thought you.

308
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,129
Yes, you thought I was dead.

309
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,552
Well.

310
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,016
I can hardly believe my eyes.

311
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,559
I mean, you don't want to believe I.

312
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,436
Come, come, Mr. Pogue, is that kind of.

313
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,520
Is that fair?

314
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,022
As fair as what you did that day.

315
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,565
You abandoned me out of a hammer.

316
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,691
If you please, Mr.

317
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,735
Pope,
it is not the time to talk about that.

318
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,820
Oh, it's the time. All right.

319
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,822
Unless you want me to go. No.

320
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,159
In which case your present voyage is over
before it's begun.

321
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,412
No, no, no, no. Povey.

322
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,081
Mr. Boyle, would you take over, please?

323
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,959
Mr. Lorenzo, take the deck. Watch.

324
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,962
Come to my cabin.

325
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,488
My heart bleeds

326
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,616
when I think of one of your delicate
constitution.

327
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,035
Having to fend for yourself
on a coral reef.

328
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,578
Mr. Boat, come off it, captain.

329
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,419
I know why I'm alone. Me?

330
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,422
So there'll be only three
a good a share instead of four.

331
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,965
It's true.

332
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,968
A hostile wind
did blow us away from your reef.

333
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:47,055
Between friends, we might have sailed back
at exactly what you would have done, Mr.

334
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:47,764
Povey.

335
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,684
So no more of your sentimental nonsense.

336
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,687
Please.

337
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,148
Know that we are for again.

338
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,566
What then?

339
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,569
We're not for

340
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,946
with two.

341
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:03,530
Boylan.

342
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,531
Lorenzo.

343
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,284
Joe loves

344
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,243
20,000 pounds.

345
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,288
A piece in their hands
would only be spent in sinful ways.

346
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,876
And you propose to remove them
from the path of temptation?

347
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,255
Oh, a knife in the dark.

348
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,757
I'm not a violent man, Mr.

349
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,342
Povey, I detest violence.

350
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,386
People have such an awkward habit
of getting in my way.

351
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,224
I am an ambitious man, Mr.

352
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,517
Povey.

353
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:37,647
An ambitious man, if he be bold
enough, can carve himself a kingdom.

354
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,860
I let to be a lord, my friend.

355
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,864
And that for a commoner
like myself takes a deal of money.

356
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,827
And that's why
that could be too less to share

357
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,539
before we raise old England game.

358
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,542
You cold got sha?

359
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,963
Flatterer.

360
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,758
Oh, get your back a game, Mr.

361
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,218
Povey.

362
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,472
You've no idea how gratifying it is
to have a congenial soul

363
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,475
to confide in.

364
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,852
Thank you.

365
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,855
Oh, there's something I want to tell you.

366
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:23,026
I have left with a clemency letter
containing an exact and complete

367
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:26,738
account of certain previous happenings,
only to be opened in case.

368
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,282
Just in case, of course,

369
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,119
you should happen to return to England
without me.

370
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,122
Of course, my dear fellow,

371
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,041
very sensible of you.

372
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,420
Now I know you will have a happy voyage.

373
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,382
I shall too.

374
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,895
I look up in the corners.

375
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,229
We are two of the luckiest man alive.

376
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,355
Just think.

377
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,358
We are sailing from Madagascar waters.

378
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,402
Don't pick up the stranger
where we left off.

379
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,446
Every office on board has a servant.

380
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,198
I request the captain assign you to me.

381
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,201
Then we can be together.

382
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,040
Yes. I've spent
a good many years of my life.

383
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,500
See that I do.

384
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,460
But I doubt if any woman minds.

385
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,295
Is there some sort?

386
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,506
Even an opinion of the realm?

387
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,174
But myself.

388
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,052
Now milady will join me in.

389
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,931
And then you, my lady sir,
not me, lady flask. Me.

390
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,726
Shadwell, there's one gentleman
creep up on another without a cough

391
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,729
or a spit or something to warn him.

392
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,273
I'm not a gentleman, sir.

393
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,566
I'm a gentleman's gentleman.

394
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,490
Give you back the hat.

395
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,371
I suppose you've tried everything.

396
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,374
There's grease.

397
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,542
Prenatal influence.

398
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,545
Perhaps.

399
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,091
Dinner says

400
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,926
thank you, Shadwell.

401
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,595
Pardon, sir.

402
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,598
I'll show you that you play.

403
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,814
What's all this mummery?

404
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,026
You can forget your bilge water manners
for the time, Mr.

405
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,820
Boyle.
You are now officers on a cruise ship.

406
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,197
So a man must stop while his manners.

407
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,200
Madam.

408
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,748
I know, I know.

409
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,501
And in the king's ship
it is customary for the officers to rise.

410
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,504
When the captain enters.

411
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,058
That's better.

412
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,061
Gentlemen, be seated.

413
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,569
Oh! Well, well, well,

414
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,572
what have we here?

415
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,789
Well, I'm.

416
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,792
Of course, but don't press.

417
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,324
Come, Mr.

418
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,327
Murphy, tell us something about yourself.

419
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,748
You already know what I was
of consequence. I'm

420
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,874
well under every.

421
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,293
I was taken by kingship
and brought to London.

422
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,671
I was tried for a parrot and condemned.

423
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,880
You were innocent. Of course.

424
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:38,466
No, sir.

425
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,093
I was guilty.

426
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,429
You speak above your station.

427
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,889
How came you go on the account?

428
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,225
Call it the love of adventure.

429
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,228
Cost in love, a scandal
and perhaps the mixing of all three.

430
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,773
And you've seen something of the world.

431
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,399
Enough.

432
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,734
Say to dislike what I've seen.

433
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,570
And to know that small old. The.

434
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,989
Perhaps you prefer the next world, Mr.

435
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,532
Mercy.

436
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,492
You were close enough to it
when you were in the condemned

437
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,495
hold of Newgate.

438
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,082
But I'm keeping you from your dinner.

439
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,629
I don't know.

440
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:22,010
Oh. oh,

441
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,601
And now, gentlemen,

442
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,394
a toast to the King.

443
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,689
And since proposing it
is the privilege of the youngest present,

444
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,274
the honor falls to Mr.

445
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,277
Bessie.

446
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,281
Mr. Mercer, we are waiting.

447
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,950
No. So,
since I have little love for the king.

448
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,745
Oh, now that proposes health,
I'll drink it.

449
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,080
Nevertheless, you are on a kingship.

450
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,207
Kingship of the devils.

451
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,082
It's all the same to me.

452
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,543
So I owe him nothing.

453
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,754
You owe him your neck, Mr. Mercy.

454
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:03,009
If it were not for his bounty, you'd be
dancing daintily on air at Wapping.

455
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,512
I owe my reprieve to you, captain.

456
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,180
So do you. I'll drink, and gladly.

457
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,890
But not to. William.

458
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,644
You stand up and drink to his Majesty's
health as I King's office.

459
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,146
I should all by fire and flame.

460
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,107
I'll have you shipped back to new.
Been on the first vessel we speak.

461
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,825
Gentlemen.

462
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,826
The king.

463
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,868
They can't go about him.

464
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,871
That's one reason.

465
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,685
It's curious.

466
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,438
Do you suppose His Majesty
put him on board to spy us out?

467
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,440
We found him chained to a pillar.

468
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,109
A new Newgate

469
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,820
wouldn't be too hard for the king
to plant him there.

470
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,115
Yes, but why would he speak
so openly against the king?

471
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,451
Your wits. An even taller than usual, Mr.

472
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,663
Lorenzo,
have you never heard of the serpent

473
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,124
that takes the color of its background?

474
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,793
The better to strike

475
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,796
Shadwell?

476
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,841
Yes. I can.

477
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,511
You have a knowledge of highborn people
and those of the called shadow.

478
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,514
What? Have you ever seen Mr. Mercy before?

479
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,516
Not before this voyage.

480
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,352
He's as high of spirit
as a gentleman of quality.

481
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,687
I'm like you.

482
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,940
Would you find out who he is,
where he comes from?

483
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,776
As you wish. Thank you. Though.

484
00:31:45,194 --> 00:32:06,466
Oh. Foggy night.

485
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,719
Good evening. Shadwell.

486
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,846
Excuse me, sir, but you seafaring men

487
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,849
always seem to be looking at something
that I never can see.

488
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,186
You're looking for something
just over the horizon.

489
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,481
You know, I recognized you for gentlemen
the moment I saw you.

490
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,276
What are you doing at sea?

491
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,029
The captain employed me to make him

492
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,032
socially acceptable. Sir.

493
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:34,577
I'm afraid
we are too far out for me to swim back

494
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,413
if I can be of service to use it.

495
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,832
Did the captain send you here?

496
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,960
Yes. Why?

497
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,712
He wants to know who or what you are.

498
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,797
Ought.

499
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,800
Who do they think I am?

500
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,928
Most of this tide
placed on board by His Majesty.

501
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,515
They seemed uneasy to him.

502
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,725
This,

503
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,935
This Captain Kidd.

504
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,396
How long have you known him?
Have you sail with him before?

505
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,271
Oh, knows.

506
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,275
All I know is he's,

507
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,278
Well, among other things,

508
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,032
a merchant captain spy.

509
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:13,950
That's strange.

510
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,953
Why should they be afraid to be spied on?

511
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,580
Good night sir.

512
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,583
Good night sir.

513
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,426
Who is he?

514
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,429
Where is he from? He's a nobody, sir.

515
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,973
He was employed by persons of quality.

516
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,142
But he learned his speech in his manners.

517
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,677
It's a matter of judgment.

518
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,638
If you fire on the uproar,
the shot will go ablaze.

519
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,807
Yea, but if you wait for the down roll.

520
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,142
The enemy is coming up.

521
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,145
Now watch.

522
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,489
Get ready.

523
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,787
Oh! Oh!

524
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,542
For these men.

525
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:50,922
Then you do as well with a 70
for throwing grape and canister at you.

526
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,007
I've done it, sir.

527
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,426
Be reload and secure
and pick up your practice on the lob.

528
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,970
And quite a swivel gun, Mr. Massey.

529
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,848
You sailed with Avery.

530
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,934
You must know they brought us fairly here.

531
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,478
If we needed to carry them,
take on stores.

532
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,355
Where would you recommend poverty?

533
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,357
Basically, we draw too much water.

534
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,483
You remember Camden?

535
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,403
Can't remember what I know.

536
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,404
The Spanish man.

537
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,907
These are Madagascar waters.

538
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,033
Poverty Bay. I say.

539
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,493
Thank you, Mr. Madison. Come along.

540
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,496
Let's go.

541
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:33,256
I'm doing a.

542
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,384
Your presence is becoming
increasingly irks.

543
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,514
You will.

544
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,502
Now let's get down

545
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,505
to the business of this voyage.

546
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,592
I made a chart to boil.

547
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,595
The coffee down.

548
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,598
I have been thinking every day
and every night.

549
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:24,974
What about that?

550
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,601
The arrow that we buried in the cave.

551
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,811
What good is it
there? Let's get it and get it back.

552
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,854
Where are we going to spend it?

553
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,815
That stays where it is for a while. Why?

554
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:37,945
We've got a better prize
sailing right into our pockets. Now,

555
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,616
here's our present position

556
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,619
is Madagascar is Calicut.

557
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:49,749
In June, the great galleon, the cuy,
the merchant sails.

558
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,543
Calicut to England.

559
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,546
We should meet, about here.

560
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:00,343
She's stuffed from keel to gunners
with treasure to the value of half

561
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,510
1 million pounds.

562
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,806
and we ought to give her safe passage

563
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,809
through the pirate seas

564
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,854
by, safe passage,
you mean where to take her, captain?

565
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,606
No, no, no, don't be greedy, Mr. Poe.

566
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,859
They are granted, most of what's in there
may find its way into our pockets.

567
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,818
But let's be fair.

568
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,444
The king.

569
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,072
Poor gentlemen will expect something.

570
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,492
But however we do it, it must be done.

571
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,371
Eagle like and on his stick.

572
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,456
Two ways you're familiar with.

573
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,210
Well, straddle bill and I can be as honest
as any man if I have the incentive.

574
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,213
Oh, yes. May Lord blame

575
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:39,590
Lord blind.

576
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,801
His name is not to be mentioned
among us, Mr.

577
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,885
Povey. He's dead.

578
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,971
So's his crew and so's ours.

579
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,266
And there's none outside this cabin
that knows what they came of them.

580
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,852
And if you all enjoy living,

581
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:55,064
you will remember that well,

582
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,193
here's to our meeting with the Queen's

583
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,196
a merchant,
with a merchant, and general merchant.

584
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,740
let's, listen for your love.

585
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,035
Indigo. And.

586
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:56,709
Winn.

587
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,669
Fresh from West. Northwest side.

588
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,297
Quest. Noise by night. Dog. But clear.

589
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:01,672
Very well.

590
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,675
Mr. Mercy.

591
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:16,812
Norris.

592
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:17,605
Peace.

593
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,566
Now he's facing.

594
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,391
The door with Mr.

595
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,394
Bow and the hangman.

596
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,564
And. No.

597
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,567
Oh, no!

598
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,612
He's dead.

599
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,824
I find the man
that's responsible for this.

600
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,827
I'll hang him.

601
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,415
Fish the yard and reset it.

602
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,675
What do you suppose happened?

603
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,427
Someone's been tampering with these lines.

604
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:51,740
We all gather

605
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,411
together to bid farewell
to a gallant seaman

606
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,873
and a stout comrade.

607
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,583
Here was a man.

608
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:05,880
Shipmates whose heart
the flinty mountains could not match.

609
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,383
Who always took better than he gave.

610
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,137
Whose benevolence was such
the orphan's might.

611
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:17,141
And the rich man's gold alike
found refuge in his pocket.

612
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,729
A jealous providence has removed him
from us,

613
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,858
and I esteem it a privilege
to commit his body to the deep.

614
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,820
We shall all mourn him.

615
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,072
I we shall mourn him.

616
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,116
But take comfort, my friends.

617
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,535
We shall never see his like again.

618
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,538
Rest in peace.

619
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,334
Pop him over.

620
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,377
The day, Mr.

621
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,380
Mercy, a great pity,
but the ship's work must go on.

622
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,132
Move your gear into poor Mr.

623
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:50,925
Boyle's cabin.

624
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,178
You will take his
place as master, as master?

625
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:15,950
I see

626
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,551
I shed.

627
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,094
Don't tell me.

628
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:39,098
After all this time at sea, I in revolt
is not from the movement of the vessel.

629
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,142
Was occasioned by the company idea

630
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:43,811
that matters.

631
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,063
I say nothing of sir,

632
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,940
but I'm a such a man.

633
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,777
And when I find a common ship
master has the presumption to copy himself

634
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,780
the coat of arms of one of our best
all sorts of families.

635
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,783
Can you wonder if I'm physically upset?

636
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,326
Whose crest was he copying?

637
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,329
Credited or not, sir? The plane crashed.

638
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,372
What are you saying?

639
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,375
Thank you sir,
of course is honoring his desk.

640
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,085
Pardon me sir, I must join.

641
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,628
The captain is inspecting.

642
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:13,007
Cost me with Mr.

643
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,010
Lorenzo.

644
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:48,727
Well, Mr.

645
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,146
Massey.

646
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,525
Do your new duties
include rubbing my desk?

647
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,861
Shoot me, captain,
and your head goes with it.

648
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,030
I'm here with the king's orders.

649
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,700
So he did want you on board.

650
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,867
Do you think he would let a man sail

651
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,161
with a crew of Newgate cutthroats
and not keep tabs on him?

652
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:10,082
And with good reason, if anything, of a
reeked of piracy, this does.

653
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,125
And murder, captain

654
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,503
Boyle's death was no accident.

655
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,547
By the way.

656
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,840
what ship was sunk here?

657
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,300
The 12 apostles.

658
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,094
Why the 12 apostles, Mr.

659
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,972
Massey?

660
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,056
Has Blaine's ring.

661
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,600
His name is on it.
He commanded the 12 apostles.

662
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,978
That'll make interesting
telling in London when we get back.

663
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:34,148
Captain, if you get back when I get back.

664
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,151
For if I don't.

665
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,028
On the other hand.

666
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,156
On the other hand. What?

667
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,367
Since the man doesn't exactly grow
rich in the king's pay.

668
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,329
crooked rogue.

669
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,166
So you have your price.

670
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,042
How much? An equal share.

671
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,961
And what's buried
here? Share that with you.

672
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,421
I'll be hanged if I do.

673
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,424
You'll be hanged if you don't have all the

674
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:01,925
I key.

675
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,928
Blackguard.

676
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,765
And if you do share Mr.

677
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,392
King's informer, what guarantee is that?

678
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,395
That you won't still turn evidence
for the Crown?

679
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,857
If I go in with you, I am equally guilty.

680
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,817
And if we are caught, we hang together.

681
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,820
But I can keep you from being caught.

682
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,363
What more could you ask?

683
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,034
You know, Mr.

684
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,704
Mercy, I've wondered sometimes
if ever I'd meet

685
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,707
a more unscrupulous blackguard
than myself,

686
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,002
and I have.

687
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,671
Well, let's be sensible about this.

688
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,089
Who knows?

689
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,550
We might be useful to each other one day,

690
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,553
in one way or another.

691
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,224
To forgotten something wearing.

692
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,520
So I have.

693
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,074
Listening carefully.

694
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,077
Because I want you to tell in London
if anything happens to me.

695
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,163
Kidd caught me in his cabin
robbing his desk.

696
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,249
I lied to him.
Told him I was a king's informer.

697
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,376
Good. Yes,
but he didn't believe me. Nothing. Wait.

698
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,002
He just pretended to.

699
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,963
Oh. Why didn't you shoot him?

700
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,881
Then? He will give us no more trouble.

701
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,884
That's a pleasure.
I'm reserving for later.

702
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,636
He proves the latter, I think.

703
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,263
Him King's men.

704
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:29,888
Oh, no.

705
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:32,891
He betrayed an uncommon interest
in the 12 apostles.

706
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,810
I didn't like him. Still around seven.

707
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,020
I mean to find out why. Why?

708
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,648
You could have charged him with robbery
and turn him over the yardarm.

709
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,899
All legal and shipshape.

710
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,568
I would have been rid of him once
and for all.

711
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,820
Let's not be impetuous, Mr. Poliakoff.

712
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,655
Leave us as he swims.

713
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:48,198
Would be

714
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,201
rather amusing to find out what he does.

715
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,160
Do you rest easy.

716
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,327
Leave.

717
00:47:52,327 --> 00:48:03,672
Must have mercy on me. You.

718
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,274
Will.

719
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,284
Stay at home.

720
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:49,635
Oh. Have the boat and pipe to Curtis.

721
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,804
Pipe to put up.

722
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,815
The queendom much?

723
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,818
And sure enough.

724
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,237
And you make her out.

725
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:12,240
Captain Russell, who?

726
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,035
She hasn't

727
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,038
the cut of a buccaneer, your Excellency.

728
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,206
Much too tidy for that.

729
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,667
More like the kingship that she has.

730
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,670
The lines of a merchantman.

731
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,422
Have the longboat ready and, man,

732
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,425
don't put him up.

733
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,099
Stand by to put a shot across her bows.

734
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,892
Mr. mercy, I, sir.

735
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,895
Number four gun crews,
stand by for action.

736
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,903
She's flying the English colors.

737
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,114
Perhaps she's. Our escort ship.

738
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,825
Was about here.
We were to meet, wasn't it?

739
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,660
We make it certain just the same.

740
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,120
It's a hit.

741
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,580
You see
that? All hands are at the station.

742
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,583
Very good. Sir.

743
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,630
Ready?

744
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,633
Fire!

745
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:12,759
Place Mr.

746
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,262
Massey on top. It.

747
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,265
I discovered this garbage is sir.

748
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,776
You will come across.

749
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,112
This is the Longboat Key.

750
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,448
Convey my compliments to all officers
who will dress

751
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,451
as befitting a kingship. I.

752
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,675
Captain William Kidd of His Majesty's
privateer.

753
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,927
Adventure. At your service, sir.

754
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,095
Mr. Povey.

755
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,180
miss. Surgeon.

756
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,931
Mr. mercy, me, master.

757
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,725
Mr. Lorenzo, my navigator.

758
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,728
Welcome aboard,
gentlemen, I'm Captain Russell,

759
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,399
I'm Lord postman, His Majesty's ambassador
to the court of the ground.

760
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,402
Mock up your obedience, sir.

761
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,946
I've been sent to give you a convoy.

762
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,157
And we'd better make haste
with our business.

763
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,160
These are unhealthy waters for ships
to be hoped to.

764
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,329
As I discovered a day or so ago.

765
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,998
You mean
you cited some of the Pirate Brotherhood?

766
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,001
More than that, sir,
we beat up two of them.

767
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,670
Hey, Brown color for that of last hope.

768
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,880
Some kind of leaks out of here.

769
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,216
Oh, stuff down there for God.

770
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,426
Could you spare us some powder and ball?

771
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,553
We use more than was safe
during the action.

772
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:39,096
Why all that?

773
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,972
You need, sir, and welcome Mr.

774
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,974
Lorenzo here. Could attend to that.

775
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:43,350
We stay here.

776
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,269
You take Mr. Lorenzo below
and see that he gets what he wants.

777
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,272
I said captain of the.

778
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,373
Sense of the master.

779
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,293
He'll take care of all your needs. And?

780
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,528
Wish.

781
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,532
Mr. Lorenzo

782
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,535
and me.

783
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,248
Thank these powder and put it in the long

784
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,251
balls. I.

785
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,306
Gentlemen made on the navy and

786
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,059
Captain Kidd and his

787
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,062
Mr. Mercy.

788
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,484
Haven't we met before?

789
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,404
I think not when me.

790
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,740
You remind me of someone I've seen.

791
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,743
I think it impossible
that we could have ever met.

792
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,332
That.

793
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,417
How do we proceed now, captain?

794
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,420
Well, I'm instructed
to give you a protection past Madagascar,

795
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,174
and you'll be safe
as long as we sail in company.

796
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,384
But Avery will be a wolf at your heels.

797
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,511
And if we are separated in darkness.

798
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,596
Oh, storm.

799
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,557
And, what would you advise then, sir?

800
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,308
Well,

801
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,479
I suppose we could take Lord Paul's

802
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:56,233
with lady and,
board the adventure to Madagascar instead.

803
00:53:56,233 --> 00:54:00,403
And then if we are separated
and this vessel should be taken.

804
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,948
What about the treasure on board?

805
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,200
One silver chest alone.

806
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,286
A present to His Majesty
from the Grand Mogo contains

807
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,414
precious gems
valued at more than 1 million pounds.

808
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:15,877
May I suggest, Your Excellency now?

809
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:19,673
Why not transfer the treasure chest
with yourself and Lady Anne on board

810
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,676
the adventure? And to.
We are out of danger.

811
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:27,138
She's a kingship
that is a great responsibility.

812
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,643
And although my instructions are that
you are to trust me

813
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:35,146
in all matters,
I don't know if I could go so far as.

814
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,274
What else can we do?

815
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,068
Three of them against
this will even two, sir.

816
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,071
We'd be hopeless. It's the wisest course.

817
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,490
I defer to Your Excellency.

818
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,035
Now, could we inspect the chests?

819
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,955
We could have them slung into our boats
along with the gear of Lord Paul's

820
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,457
with them, lady. And I said to me.
Come this up.

821
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,460
No trouble at all.

822
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,637
Hoist away!

823
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,644
Mr. Hervey,

824
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,688
I send for the manifest, captain.

825
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,523
You may check it
against the contents of this chest.

826
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,984
And give me your receipt, if you will.

827
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,029
Gladly, gladly. Oh, there you are, Mr.

828
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:27,115
Renzo, have you, completed your business?

829
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,075
Almost.

830
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,078
Your people have been most kind
to be done, Russell.

831
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,498
There is only one detail left.

832
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,250
It will not take a minute.

833
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:37,834
Finished up.

834
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,170
Then we must be gone within the hour.

835
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,089
Yes. Copy. Done.

836
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,215
Oh, manifest.

837
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,134
Would you attend to that, Mr. Perry?

838
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,135
Thank you very much, captain.

839
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,468
Mr. Lorenzo, you've seen a lovely lady
before.

840
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,845
This.

841
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,848
A tribute to your beauty, ma'am.

842
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,185
did you finish your business below?

843
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,520
Yes, captain.

844
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,772
Then we'd better be underway.

845
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,317
Mr. Mercy, you will see Lord
Paul's with the lady and the boat.

846
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:47,737
I see.

847
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,452
You walking?

848
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,964
They plan for the long run.

849
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,787
You will look after the lounging.

850
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,790
Mr. Lorenzo.

851
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,418
I apologize,
but I did try poor accommodations.

852
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,004
But we've had a chat.
Well, we'll see the show made comfortable.

853
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,339
It's a pleasure
to have Your Ladyship aboard.

854
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,342
If you'll follow.

855
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,648
Why hasn't it happened?

856
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,993
She's blown up.

857
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,537
Someone must have touched over
the magazine.

858
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,540
Send out your boats at one son.

859
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,375
You can't ask me to risk men there.

860
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,337
That show.

861
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,048
Let me go,

862
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:40,600
captain. No!

863
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:18,555
No. Excuse me.

864
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:18,972
Milady.

865
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,976
Your father.

866
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,520
May I say sorry? I am.

867
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,606
The captain is requested that you take
your meals in the main cabin.

868
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:29,774
Oh, no.

869
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:32,193
Shadwell, I can't bear to face those men.

870
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,196
I can't, I quite understand, milady.

871
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,116
But the captain's orders are orders.

872
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,284
Shadwell, you must help me.

873
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,536
There's no one else I can trust.

874
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,121
What can I do, milady?

875
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,330
I'm only a servant.

876
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,665
Oh, where can I turn?

877
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,668
I I'm so confused and frightened. I.

878
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,088
Think of my father and the others

879
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,091
lost back there.

880
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,218
And on the ship,

881
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:01,264
wherever I go, those horrible staring
men had Lorenzo,

882
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,267
who was always standing behind me,
beside me.

883
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,062
Last night there was a tapping on the door
when I opened it.

884
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,232
There he was there, that
evil, smiling face of his

885
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:12,984
where he might

886
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,945
better belong with those pirates
you found a few days ago.

887
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,114
The pirates.

888
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,116
Merlin.

889
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,077
We fought no pirates,

890
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:23,786
my father said.

891
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,789
Captain Kidd told.

892
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:31,669
Shad.

893
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,672
Well, what manner of ship is this?

894
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:39,886
My father was killed

895
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,847
deliberately, I'm sure of it, sir.

896
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,433
That's
why I got back to face your captain.

897
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,436
I accuse him.

898
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,606
That is a man on board, milady.

899
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,609
A gentleman whom I know you can trust,

900
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,986
Mr. Mercy.

901
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,405
Yes, milady.

902
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,991
Shadwell,
I know I've never seen him before.

903
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,911
No matter how he denies it.

904
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,455
His name is mercy.

905
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,623
Who is he?

906
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,333
All I really know is milady.

907
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,794
He's now a friend of the captain's.

908
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,128
Perhaps if I ask him.

909
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,464
Who shall I call?

910
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,965
Yes, will you please?

911
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,968
Yes, milady.

912
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,313
I am asking you again.

913
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,273
Very nice, my dear.

914
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,066
Be done.

915
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,275
Oh! Fancy manners.

916
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,236
You're not impressed me, Mr. Lorenzo.

917
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:44,075
When do we divide the gold in London?

918
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:47,078
Not before. I'm

919
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,913
there. Look, are we done?

920
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,791
I would make a bargain with you.
A thug in.

921
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,418
Everybody wants to bargain with me.

922
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,753
You and messy foreign thought.

923
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,756
What do you think
I am, a stinking sausage merchant?

924
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,467
What kind of a bargain?

925
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:04,387
The girl.

926
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,263
All my life

927
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,266
I have dreamed of a beautiful woman
like that.

928
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,519
Give me half of my denaro now

929
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,856
and you can split the rest between you,
if you will let me have her

930
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,693
fie on him.

931
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,696
He's met with love again.

932
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:25,241
I want her, and I am going to take her

933
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:30,204
whether I like it or not.

934
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,253
With all this treasure on board,

935
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,256
the crew is like a barrel of hot
gunpowder.

936
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,385
All that is needed
is a word in the right ears.

937
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:45,845
Do you mean look at me.

938
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,265
You're a witness.

939
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,268
He's inciting the crew to mutiny.

940
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,520
I know nothing like that.

941
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,523
Done. I was only joking.

942
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,525
You have a very nasty way of joking, Mr.

943
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,360
Lorenzo.

944
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,362
As for the girl,
I have my own plans for her.

945
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:06,282
They do not include you.

946
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:22,006
Get out. To.

947
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,570
Who is it?

948
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,573
Adam, listen.

949
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,952
You see, I'm.

950
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,099
Thank you for coming, Mr.

951
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,102
Murcia. I don't names Adam Bloom,

952
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,521
son of Lord black.

953
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,315
I knew it, I know

954
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,192
well, what are you doing on this ship?

955
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,570
My father was killed
and accused of piracy.

956
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,320
Few people believe.

957
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,364
Don't blame the king did.

958
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,533
That's why I went to sing and turned
pirate three years ago.

959
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,993
That's why I'm on this ship.

960
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,744
I knew that
some day I'd come upon the truth

961
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:37,790
that you have.

962
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,543
It was Captain Kidd
who killed your father.

963
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,337
Wasn't.

964
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:43,671
Adam.

965
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,715
Wonderful.

966
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,718
He did the same thing to my father,

967
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,345
the butcher

968
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,598
taken me three years to track him down.

969
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,725
Three years of degradation.

970
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,559
Now I can cut him away.

971
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,686
I want him, and he knows it.

972
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,730
You mean he knows what you are?

973
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,648
He knows something.

974
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,400
That's why you didn't admit to me
who you are.

975
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,443
Why are you avoiding me?

976
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,279
If Kidd knows we shared this, he could
kill you with a little compunction.

977
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,282
As he means to kill me if I let him.

978
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,451
What can I do to help?

979
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,454
It must be something.

980
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,915
Forget
everything you've seen on this ship.

981
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,625
Play up time. Be friendly.

982
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,586
That way you'll be safe
now when you get back to London.

983
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,296
No matter what has happened to me.

984
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,840
Go to the Lords of the Admiralty
and the King.

985
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,343
You'll be doing me
a great service as well as yourself.

986
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,597
I will add him, I promise.

987
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:39,101
You're going to have trouble with Lorenzo.

988
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,686
A meeting of the lambs. Exciting!

989
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:43,147
The tiger is blood
is getting too rich for him.

990
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:46,150
He'd be the better for bleeding.

991
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,945
Things are getting a bit complicated,
milord.

992
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,113
The King
may accept the elimination of the queen.

993
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,615
The Virgin next.

994
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,618
Maybe
even the sudden demise of Lord Bosworth.

995
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:59,455
But what about the lady
who said you had plans for?

996
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,374
Do they include Mr. Povey?

997
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:04,377
The little dears is safe with me
as if she was my daughter.

998
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,046
My passion is power and gold.

999
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:11,467
Since she suspects nothing,
I deliver her to His Majesty,

1000
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,470
along with his share
of the Queen of merchants goods.

1001
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,932
Oh! Weep appropriately over
the untimely demise of her.

1002
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:21,352
received the grateful thanks of me.

1003
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:26,232
Sovereign and a peerage is mine,
Lord love, if you will.

1004
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:29,235
But that's what ought to have another man.

1005
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,653
No devil shall stop me.

1006
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,913
Shadwell, Senorita.

1007
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,916
Milady, do not be alarmed.

1008
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,795
Now that she knows
who I am, the kind of a ship

1009
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:50,798
she's on,
I think we can count on to keep her here.

1010
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,924
You stay here till I come off.

1011
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:54,927
Watch.

1012
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:19,827
Shadwell.

1013
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,748
Lose your head.

1014
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,083
Least luck's with us tonight.

1015
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,086
Whichever either of them
would you like to see survive?

1016
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,390
Mr. mercy, you did well to protect her.

1017
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:46,831
Well.

1018
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,466
You all right, sir?

1019
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,134
Yes, I'm all right.

1020
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,137
Look at the lady at.

1021
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:06,142
Arms!

1022
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,145
Let my medallion.

1023
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,354
It's gone.

1024
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,815
Has the plane crest on it?

1025
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:15,609
Plane?

1026
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:16,485
Perhaps I can find it.

1027
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,528
Please. No.

1028
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,531
It must have come off
just before Lorenzo went through the port.

1029
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,992
Chad will take away the end to a cabin.

1030
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,910
Oh, please. Adam,
I can't go in there. You must.

1031
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:27,496
And this is serious.
It involves you. Remember?

1032
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,915
No matter what Trixie tries,
you've never seen me before.

1033
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:32,001
And you don't know who I am. Shadwell,
I think.

1034
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,669
Oh, don't worry about me, Jeanette.

1035
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,296
He never could get anything out of me.

1036
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,630
And you never will.

1037
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,507
It's the only way you'll be safe.
Shadwell.

1038
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,967
Watch out for you.

1039
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,636
What about you, Adam? What would he do?

1040
01:09:42,636 --> 01:09:44,054
The same thing he's done with the others.

1041
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,306
If he gets a chance.

1042
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,640
What? Don't worry.

1043
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,143
I at least know what to expect. Go.

1044
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,230
Shadwell, if anything does

1045
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,317
happen, remember you the stand by lady
and see that you get safely to London.

1046
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,445
I'll stick my life on it. I know you will.

1047
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,989
Be careful, Adam.

1048
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,992
Please be careful.

1049
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,410
Come.

1050
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,413
The lady.

1051
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:23,886
Oh! He's no king's head.

1052
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,971
Who is it, then?

1053
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,224
Tomorrow
he put it into the lagoon for water.

1054
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,810
And while the crew's getting it on board,
you and me and Mr.

1055
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,646
Mercer, he's going to the cave.

1056
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,147
You're going to take him in there?

1057
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,858
I have a peculiar humor to watch my clever

1058
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:40,861
young friends face when we dig out ship.

1059
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,740
Sweet dreams.

1060
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:48,512
Come.

1061
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,452
They pass, Mr.

1062
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,455
mercy, you haven't got forever.

1063
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,669
Who might this be?

1064
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,755
But perhaps a man

1065
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,716
that has too many questions.

1066
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:34,433
Gently.

1067
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,353
Now, Mr. Mercy, you've come on. Something.

1068
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:48,030
So it was the 12 apostles.

1069
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,365
They. Captain?

1070
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,741
Yes, it was Mr.

1071
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,326
Mercy.

1072
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,329
You open it up.

1073
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:22,564
Blames.

1074
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,567
Blames.

1075
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:28,445
He was a brave seaman, but foolish.

1076
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:31,448
Did you happen to know him, Mr. mercy?

1077
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,034
I heard of him.

1078
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:36,995
I thought perhaps you had.

1079
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,541
This.

1080
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:43,001
Is yours,

1081
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:46,004
Mr.. I,

1082
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,507
traded a ring for it.

1083
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,300
One of Avery's men?

1084
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,927
Yes.

1085
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,887
When I encountered Lord flying at sea,

1086
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,890
I did my simple duty as a loyal subject.

1087
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:01,270
A pity
he turned pirate and traitor to his king.

1088
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:02,763
Liar!

1089
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:51,236
Was. He's made for the sharks now, Mr.

1090
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:54,490
Appleby, the tide comes in at this place
in half an hour.

1091
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,867
We've nothing more to fear.

1092
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,244
Yeah, sure. I haven't come it. Yeah.

1093
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:00,287
It's a long voyage.

1094
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,290
Helpless to poke at anything might happen.

1095
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,341
Naturally, her ladyship

1096
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,344
is still very distressed
in the midst of life.

1097
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,596
We are in death, Shadwell.

1098
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:22,726
And though my heart may my heart bleeds.

1099
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,024
Confound you, Shadwell.

1100
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:31,235
You drove
the thought right out of the head,

1101
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:34,446
and it was an uncommon pretty one,
I'm sure of that.

1102
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:38,575
It got all at once to tell us
she can't mourn forever.

1103
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:42,037
Nigel, I expect you to take our meals
in the main cabin with the rest of us.

1104
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:45,624
Very well.

1105
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,585
Well, that

1106
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:51,588
we turned just in time to see him
go over the edge.

1107
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,048
Such for now.

1108
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,300
It never came up.

1109
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,052
Well,

1110
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,845
here's to him,

1111
01:15:58,845 --> 01:15:59,805
wherever it is.

1112
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,808
You feeling ill?

1113
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,811
Yes, sir.

1114
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:06,812
I'll go to my cabin.

1115
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,897
With your permission, if you wish.

1116
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:12,734
It's been quite a trying voyage,
what with one little thing and another.

1117
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,445
But bear up. You'll soon be home again.

1118
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,172
I warned Adam not to come.

1119
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:35,591
No one could have stopped you.

1120
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,218
It was cold blooded. Plan delivered.

1121
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,845
The same will happen to Her ladyship.

1122
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,848
Unless we can.

1123
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:48,979
Read them.

1124
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:55,235
How did you find you on board, sir?

1125
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,696
I've come back for lady. Oh,
thank you sir.

1126
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,699
I've been hanging on the rudder chains and
stock waiting for the turn of the watch.

1127
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,619
The jolly boat's motor stayed.

1128
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,620
I waited alongside.

1129
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,330
It's secured right down at this point

1130
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,166
where I'd get in it
and drift aft under the main cabin.

1131
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,626
Well, now, get me some dry clothes.

1132
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,251
Where's the captain?

1133
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,419
In his own cabin, with Mr.

1134
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,839
Purvis on examining the silver chest
they brought back on board

1135
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,591
my father's chest.

1136
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:19,176
Chadwick Kidd doesn't suspect you.

1137
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,677
Tell me the end
to get some things together.

1138
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,929
And when the coast is clear,
you come back for me? Yes, sir.

1139
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,402
I, sir,

1140
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:40,405
I felt
rather hot by watching the daybreak.

1141
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:43,450
Well, weighing on the morning tide,
I thought.

1142
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:03,887
Kidd doesn't suspect Shadwell.

1143
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,348
He's staying on board.
He'll be evidence for us in London.

1144
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,183
Watching the small boat,
the water staying.

1145
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,142
We're all ashore.

1146
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,185
Then we're at home.

1147
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,646
Two days journey.
Overland is the pirate town of last Hope.

1148
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,065
It's the most lawless place on Earth.
But I have friends there.

1149
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,442
Somehow
they'll find us a ship for England.

1150
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,735
England?

1151
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:21,697
Now come on.

1152
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:39,965
Get down on the boat!

1153
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:47,222
Goodbye.

1154
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,809
The lady climbed aboard. Got.

1155
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,779
A scene in England.

1156
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:06,992
I know who's in that book now.

1157
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,828
Come on.

1158
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:12,831
Come on.

1159
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:28,972
Where?

1160
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,272
Thank you.

1161
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,275
May Lord.

1162
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,910
Where?

1163
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,913
Is the London?

1164
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:04,633
Why? But.

1165
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:11,890
Hold on to me.

1166
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:20,440
Take.

1167
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:26,530
Why? Me.

1168
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:44,923
He's dead as a mackerel.

1169
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:45,841
He's gone through

1170
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:47,050
all right.

1171
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,844
I guess I've never met captain.

1172
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,762
I'm good. Reckless.

1173
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:53,765
Back to the ship, boy.

1174
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:23,795
If you're thinking what I think

1175
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:26,798
you're thinking, my friend, forget it.

1176
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,801
As a little measure of a letter
I left in London.

1177
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:33,096
Spoilsport.

1178
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,557
Well.

1179
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:40,103
From. I'm.

1180
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:05,587
When.

1181
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,198
Captain William Kidd.

1182
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,874
Greetings, captain.

1183
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:46,878
What news have you brought me from the
Indian seas for your leave, Your Majesty.

1184
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:49,798
Both good and ill, but mostly
very good indeed.

1185
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,717
I return
by way of the American colonies. So?

1186
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:54,844
So I understood

1187
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:56,346
with the main points of your voyage.

1188
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:59,015
I am familiar.

1189
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:02,811
I wonder if you can enlighten me
about the affair of the Queen's godchild.

1190
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,813
Lady and Dunstan and your ship, master Mr.

1191
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:05,855
Mercy.

1192
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:10,735
Oh, that poor, impetuous fellows here
inveigle that badge of innocence

1193
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:14,948
he did into running away with him
and catching him red handed in defense.

1194
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,576
The very life I was forced to dispatch

1195
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:21,579
him both rest in peace.

1196
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,959
Tell me, captain, about the treasure

1197
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:28,211
and the merchant.

1198
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,005
Unfortunate, sire.

1199
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,506
Most unfortunate.

1200
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,215
We ship.

1201
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:37,095
But that chest, when she blew
and all souls went heavenward.

1202
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:39,764
Rest in peace to them.

1203
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,516
Ditto.

1204
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,727
I see

1205
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,396
now about the 12 apostles and Lord Blaine.

1206
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:49,482
You encounter any trace naysayer.

1207
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:53,570
I can only hope that the weight
of his sins sank both him and the ship.

1208
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,823
I see

1209
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:59,826
then how do you explain this?

1210
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:05,957
Whose might that be, your Majesty?

1211
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,419
My officers found it on your ship
at Plymouth after you left for London.

1212
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:14,132
It bears the Blaine crest,
which I believe you are not unfamiliar.

1213
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:15,925
I've always felt that, Mr.

1214
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:17,343
Pope. A message in a very while.

1215
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:19,512
A fellow indeed
was hiding something from me

1216
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:21,014
or hiding it in a secret laceration.

1217
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,432
You are Kevin, captain.

1218
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:25,226
I hope it has a proper explanation, sire.

1219
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,895
Mr. Pope, he was killed three days ago.

1220
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,396
Defending it with his dying oath.

1221
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:31,149
He swore it was not his prep. Shadwell.

1222
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:35,528
Mere ballot slip to the board might not
have come to my Madagascar cave, captain.

1223
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,572
Something dreadful clear about all this.

1224
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,657
Isn't that what the allies look?

1225
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,379
Nightmare.

1226
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:55,840
A pity you overlooked last hope, captain.

1227
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,052
We stood on the headland with my friend
Avery and watched you sail by.

1228
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,347
May I please, your Majesty,
I accuse this man of piracy and murder.

1229
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:05,767
Was ever a gentleman.

1230
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,603
So Misfortunate lock him up in

1231
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,815
Newgate is to be held for the next session
of the Court of Orient.

1232
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:14,818
Time and I
that have been tried for his life.

1233
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:17,821
I'm sorry.

1234
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,824
You cannot.

1235
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:23,034
Oh, I don't wish to the credit.

1236
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:26,037
I'm for the honor and glory of England.

1237
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:31,543
So he is may bequest to them.

1238
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,129
What hunch would I have heard?

1239
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:37,132
And to their sons, hands

1240
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:42,137
down,
through the endless corridors of time.

1241
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:47,600
Greed that spawns murder.

1242
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:50,395
Hatred

1243
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:53,398
that corrodes the soul.

1244
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,067
Ambition.

1245
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:59,487
The foulest trumpet of all.

1246
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:00,822
Hey, Jack.

1247
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,992
Jack ketch,
send me that note for sixpence yet.

1248
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,786
Save you my name, lads.

1249
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:09,164
You can have it all for nothing.

1250
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:12,917
If you'd only step up here and wear it.

1251
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,381
I need it,

1252
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:21,384
can't wait forever.

1253
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:26,347
Captain Kidd is dead, milord Lane.

1254
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,308
His account is closed.

1255
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:29,225
Now I want manikin.

1256
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:30,393
I have turned for the injustice.

1257
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:32,395
I wept upon your father.

1258
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,146
I'll put you up.

1259
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,481
See, Lord, what do you suggest?

1260
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,026
We have a fine frigate of 50 guns

1261
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,653
commissioned for American waters, sire.

1262
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:43,656
That we thought of naming the lady and

1263
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,452
it should be a wedding gift to you
from the Crown.

1264
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,787
Your loyalty
and service to King and country.
