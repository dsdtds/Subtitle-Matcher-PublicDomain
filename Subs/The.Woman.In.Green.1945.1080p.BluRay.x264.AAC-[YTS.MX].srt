1
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,320
<i>I won't forget
that morning,</i>

2
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,960
<i>not if I live to be 100.</i>

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,660
<i>I counted the men as they
marched out of the Yard.</i>

4
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>They'd hardly
slept for weeks.</i>

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,660
<i>We at the CID had
slept even less, </i>

6
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,630
<i>for the nightmare
that kept us awake</i>

7
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,720
<i>was all the
same nightmare.</i>

8
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,110
<i>That's why we
weren't surprised</i>

9
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,770
<i>when the Commissioner
had asked us up to</i>

10
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,820
<i>the conference room
for a bit of a talk.</i>

11
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,390
<i>He would talk to us
plenty, we knew that.</i>

12
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,980
<i>It didn't help any to know
what was ahead of us.</i>

13
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,400
Must we have that
window open, Gregson?

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,230
Oh shut it if you want to.

15
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,270
The Chief will be in
enough of a temper

16
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,510
without having a ruddy blast
down the back of his neck!

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,920
Gentlemen, the Commissioner.

18
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,550
Stuffy in here.

19
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,260
Be seated, won't you?

20
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,680
Gentlemen, if you wish to
know what able men you are,

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,930
read any of the works
of popular fiction

22
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,640
that glamorize your achievement

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,190
but don't, I beg of you,
read the daily papers.

24
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,900
They might give you
an inferiority complex.

25
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,380
I hate to mention it,

26
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,500
but we're confronted
with a series of

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,060
the most atrocious murders
since Jack the Ripper.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,830
And in the meantime,

29
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,950
the CID might as well be
playing at shove hate me

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,370
for all the good
we've accomplished.

31
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,040
Now, look

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,760
here, here and here.

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,550
Each of these red flags
scattered through the city

34
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,590
stands for a woman
brutally murdered,

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,930
a woman's terror,

36
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,430
a woman's death agony.

37
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,020
These are no ordinary crimes.

38
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,770
These are the works of
a fiend who kills first

39
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,110
and mutilates afterwards.

40
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,650
A ghoul who hacks off a
part of his victim's body

41
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,360
and carries it away with him,

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,950
a loathsome souvenir
of his butchery.

43
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,320
Three women murdered so far,

44
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,830
and you haven't
turned in one clue.

45
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,910
You haven't given me one lead.

46
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,080
Here you sit and wait for
news of a fourth victim

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,060
with your arms folded.

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,380
<i>Well, we hadn't</i>
long to wait.

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,180
<i>It was down Lamberth Way</i>

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,350
<i>where a young woman was</i>
hurrying home late last night.

51
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,480
<i>She saw something</i>
and stopped.

52
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,640
<i>It was a Constable.</i>

53
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,020
<i>He spoke to her, </i>

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,890
<i>and he walked along</i>
with her just in case.

55
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,740
<i>He saw her go</i>
down the stairway

56
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,740
<i>to the basement</i>
lodging where she lived.

57
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,970
<i>I can only surmise</i>
what happened after that.

58
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,590
<i>So I put my pride</i>
in my pocket

59
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,760
<i>and went to see the man</i>
that so often helped out

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,350
<i>Inspector Lestrade</i>
and myself in the past

61
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,160
<i>Mr. Sherlock Holmes.</i>

62
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,160
<i>If ever a man</i>
needed help, I did.

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,660
This makes four, Inspector.

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,250
Four defenseless women
here in the heart of London.

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,580
And every one with the right
forefinger hacked off.

66
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,550
Not hacked, Inspector Gregson,

67
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,800
cleanly, expertly severed.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,920
The work of a skilled surgeon.

69
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,510
That's our only clue.

70
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,220
Much about the age
of my sister's girl.

71
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,520
Is there no way of
stopping this, Mr. Holmes?

72
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,850
Yes, there's a way somehow.

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,360
A fiend that did this.

74
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,030
I promise, I promise.

75
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,610
We've nothing go on,
that's the rotten part of it.

76
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,820
We can't get far without
knowing the motive.

77
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,490
Well, at least we know
what the motives were not.

78
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,450
It wasn't robbery nor
passion, nor vengeance,

79
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,620
because they all came at
totally unrelated families.

80
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,500
Steady, Inspector, steady.

81
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,540
I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes.

82
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,760
I don't turn a hair when it's a
bloke that can look after himself,

83
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,130
but a little slip
of a thing like that.

84
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,130
Yes, it's horrible.
Come on, let's get a drink.

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,780
- Good evening, Mr. Holmes.
- Good evening, Vincent.

86
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,330
Whiskey and soda, please, and a double
for my friend here, Inspector Gregson.

87
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:16,950
Very good, sir.

88
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,660
Make mine Irish.

89
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,830
It's noble to give me a hand
on this thing, Mr. Holmes.

90
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,130
Always a pleasure to be of help
to Scotland Yard, Inspector.

91
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,630
A little out of my line,
looking for a maniac

92
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,880
that murders just for
the fun of the hunt.

93
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,800
Or perhaps, just to
get a human finger.

94
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,390
In all four cases,

95
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,230
The murderer risks capture,

96
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,570
by stopping to secure a finger.

97
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,980
I wonder what for?

98
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,570
Who knows? He's just a madman.

99
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,410
Perhaps there's a
method in his madness.

100
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,870
If we could just trace
those missing fingers.

101
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,160
If?

102
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,870
If we could just drain
the English Channel,

103
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,500
we might find a penny.

104
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, thank you.

105
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,790
You may keep those, Mr. Holmes.

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,840
Thank you.

107
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,390
Sir George Fenwick, isn't it?

108
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,430
Yes.

109
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,310
Is that his daughter with him?

110
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,650
Don't be so naive, Inspector.

111
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,150
You know everyone,
don't you, darling?

112
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,730
Well, hardly.

113
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,270
A week ago, I didn't know you.

114
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,610
A week, how fast it's gone.

115
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,880
I collect these things.

116
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,960
How very quaint of you.

117
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,790
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

118
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,390
What are you looking at,
Mr. Holmes?

119
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,720
Looking at a very
handsome woman.

120
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,890
Not fond of the purple,

121
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,140
but giving an
excellent invitation.

122
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,020
Would you like to come to
my flat for a nightcap?

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,940
- Lovely idea.
- Yes, isn't it?

124
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,490
I wonder where she's
taking Sir George Fenwick?

125
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,610
Don't be so naive, Mr. Holmes.

126
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,550
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Hello, Crandon.

127
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,890
- Any messages?
- No, ma'am.

128
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,930
Thank you.

129
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,400
Uh, drinks, Crandon
one of your nice surprises.

130
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,730
I say, you don't mean that...

132
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,980
Crandon's a marvel,
aren't you, Crandon?

133
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,360
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,780
You wouldn't believe
the things she can do.

135
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,160
Hmm.

136
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,280
Ah, charming place, delightful.

137
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,830
Really, you think so?
I'm so glad.

138
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,370
Do sit down.

139
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,500
Do you mind?

140
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,750
Do I mind?

141
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,300
What a question.

142
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,260
I don't mind anything, really,

143
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,840
except not being with you.

144
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,930
Now, you really don't want
me to believe that, do you?

145
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,310
- Not too seriously.
- Good.

146
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,640
We're both quite
grown up, aren't we?

147
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
Quite.

148
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,960
You're a treasure, Crandon.

149
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,890
And lower the lights
a little as you leave.

150
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,460
I prefer a more
flattering light.

151
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,840
In any light, you'd be...

152
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,590
Would I?

153
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,970
And don't you know it.

154
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,790
Perhaps I do.

155
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,850
Oh, that priceless woman.

156
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,440
You wouldn't believe it,
but she's absurdly romantic.

157
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,650
She loves dreamy music,
and she thinks that we...

158
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,240
But we do, don't we?

159
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,740
Do we?

160
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,280
Well, it's rather
soothing, restful.

161
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,580
Yes.

162
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,700
And we all need rest at times.

163
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,580
Like tired children
who played too long.

164
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,460
You've played with wooden
soldiers, I suppose?

165
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,760
Funny, hadn't thought
of that for years.

166
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,680
Toy boats were my special joy.

167
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,890
Anything I could
set afloat anywhere.

168
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,810
Like this, and this.

169
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,560
Toy boats sailing into
the never-never land,

170
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,400
the land of beautiful dreams.

171
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,570
Look.

172
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,910
Look odd, isn't it, how
the light is reflected.

173
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,080
Little specks of light
that move and move,

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,680
like stars on a
slowly-moving stream.

175
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,960
- You know Holmes I'm very sensitive to atmosphere.
- Oh?

176
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,420
Yes, I can tell by
the feel of this room

177
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,760
there's been a murder
committed here.

178
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,550
It may interest you to
know, my dear fellow,

179
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,260
it was at the other
side of that door

180
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,840
at the foot of the stairs that
the poor girl was murdered.

181
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,390
If only I could find it.

182
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,220
Find what?

183
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,140
The one thing these unfortunate
victims have in common

184
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,020
that might give us a
motive for these murders.

185
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,400
There must be something.

186
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,730
Another Jack the Ripper,
if you ask me

187
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,980
a homicidal maniac.

188
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,650
No, Watson, in the
case of Jack the Ripper,

189
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,030
there was one thing in common.

190
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,740
His victims were all
from one walk of life,

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,150
living in the same
section of the city.

192
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,200
In this case, the murderer
chooses his victims

193
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
from all walks of life and from
different sections of the city.

194
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,580
No, my dear fellow,

195
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,120
this is not the work
of a homicidal maniac.

196
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,420
It's something
infinitely more sinister.

197
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,580
You're giving me the creeps.

198
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,330
What on earth are
you talking about?

199
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,880
Watson, I'm convinced

200
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,050
that these murders
are only incidental

201
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,260
to some larger and
more diabolical scheme.

202
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,720
That may be, but
why the severed fingers?

203
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,010
The answer to that
question, my dear fellow,

204
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,970
is our only hope of
solving these mysteries.

205
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,060
"Dear Sister, I am so happy"

206
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,390
I had such a lovely Holiday at
Brighton with you and Alph,

207
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,560
"and I'm looking forward
to being with you again."

208
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,020
Poor little thing.

209
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,320
Sort of raises a
lump in your throat.

210
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,200
I can picture her sitting here
happily writing this letter

211
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,170
and not a bit realizing that
she's shortly going to her death.

212
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,780
Hello.

213
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,040
Gregson.

214
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,920
Oh, there you are, Mr. Holmes,

215
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,250
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- What's happened?

216
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,880
Murder in Edgware Road,
not half an hour ago.

217
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,380
- Woman?
- Yes,

218
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,850
and the right forefinger
cut off clean.

219
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,960

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,300

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,780
On me fancy, ma'am,

237
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,410
there's been another of
those horrible murders.

238
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,990
Dear, dear, how shocking.

239
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,530
Yes, ma'am,

240
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,710
I really don't feel quite
safe here myself.

241
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,190
Oh, dear.

242
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,010
- Why, Sir George!
- I must see Miss Marlow at once.

243
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,720
- I don't know if she's...
- I must see her, where is she?

244
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,440
Lydia.

245
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,980
Why, Sir George!

246
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,650
What is it, what happened?

247
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,980
I don't know.

248
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,740
You'll have to help me.
You've got to help me!

249
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,150
But I don't understand.

250
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,620
Listen, I woke up
a few minutes ago

251
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,580
in a cheap boardinghouse

252
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,160
off Edgware Road.

253
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,290
I don't know how I came there,

254
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,700
I don't know when.

255
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,830
The last thing I remember
is being here with you.

256
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,120
Calm yourself, Sir George.

257
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,340
When did I leave here?

258
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,760
Well, it was about, uh, uh...

259
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,350
It was 10:45, ma'am, precisely.

260
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,470
You seemed, forgive me,

261
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,680
just a little bit distressed,

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,180
detached, not interested.

263
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,600
I thought I'd said
something to offend you.

264
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,530
I don't remember.

265
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,360
I can't remember.

266
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,950
Tell me, has this
happened to you before?

267
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,410
Before?

268
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,590
Well, there is such a thing
as amnesia, you know?

269
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,000
If it was 10:45 when I left you,

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,920
it was 9:00 this
morning when I woke,

271
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,850
over ten hours lost.

272
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,010
Ten hours that
I can't account for.

273
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,430
And in my pocket
when I awoke, I found,

274
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,480
here in my pocket.

275
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,940
That... that isn't...

276
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,650
Oh, it's not for you, of course,

277
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,950
it can't be.

278
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,980
Excuse me, ma'am,

279
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,780
but there's a man asking
to see the gentleman.

280
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,740
- Send him away.
- Yes, ma'am.

281
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,990
No, no, no, please.

282
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,990
I'll see him.

283
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,420
Well?

284
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,840
Delightful room.

285
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,880
Not much like the place

286
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,220
you woke up in this morning.

287
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,030
- You followed me here?
- Yes.

288
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,140
Are you a detective?

289
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh, no.

290
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,930
Quite the contrary.

291
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,190
Don't be afraid, Sir George.

292
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,400
You know my name?

293
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,770
Oh, yes.

294
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,730
A very old and
highly-honored name.

295
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,200
And being the
bearer of such a name,

296
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,110
and also a very wealthy man,

297
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,470
I thought you might care to
possess yourself this trifle,

298
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,540
rather than let it fall into
the hands of the police.

299
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,210
It's yours, if I'm not mistaken,

300
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,400
the initials G.F.

301
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,130
Where did you get this?

302
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,760
It came out of your pocket.

303
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,990
I saw it fall,
but you never noticed.

304
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,560
You were very busy,

305
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,020
bending over something,

306
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,580
with a knife.

307
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,600
Then you put
something in your pocket.

308
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,370
Come along, Holmes,
come along, come along.

309
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,960
How many more times
must I tell you.

310
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,790
You're missing a treat,
this is delicious.

311
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,630
Little jam tarts to follow.

312
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,750
Aren't you tempted?

313
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,750
Hmm.

314
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,690
You and your fleshpots.

315
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,270
They tell me that fish
is good for the brains.

316
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,600
Brains, I haven't any.

317
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,850
You realize that a day,

318
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,440
a whole day and a
night have gone by

319
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,270
since that bestial affair
in Edgware Road?

320
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,410
I'm as much in the dark as ever.

321
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,740
Hello, here comes a client

322
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,830
unless I'm very much mistaken.

323
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,940
Well, attractive,
very attractive.

324
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,390
Obviously, she left home

325
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,010
under the stress of
some very great emotion.

326
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,060
How do you know that?

327
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,390
She isn't wearing any gloves,

328
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,600
a startling omission on
a young lady of fashion.

329
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,100
Well, she didn't
put her coat on.

330
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,980
Open car, too.

331
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,780
Furthermore, there's something in
that bag she wants to show me.

332
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,030
What makes you say that?

333
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,530
The bag doesn't match her dress.

334
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,450
And again, it was
picked for size

335
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,240
rather than style

336
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,790
to accommodate
some bulky object.

337
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,670
You amaze me Holmes.

338
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,440
Elementary, my dear fellow.

339
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,920
Well, that's interesting.

340
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,340
What is?

341
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,800
That cab,

342
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,470
at the empty house.

343
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,270
I wonder why he's
followed her here?

344
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,770
Well, wouldn't you?

345
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,980
Quiet, Watson.
Give me the glasses.

346
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,500
Well, we shall soon know.

347
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,650
Yes, Mrs. Hudson?

348
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,210
It's a young lady sir,
most urgent.

349
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,550
Ask her to come in.

350
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,270
Go right in, Miss.

351
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,510
- Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, this is my friend, Dr. Watson.

352
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,810
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

353
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,640
Mr. Holmes, you must
excuse me, please, I...

354
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,850
Yes, well, won't you sit down?

355
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,940
- Come along.
- May I?

356
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,730
It's quite alright.

357
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,400
Thank you.

358
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,870
Now, try to control yourself, Miss
Fenwick, you're with friends.

359
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:34,910
You know my name?

360
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,290
No magic, I assure you.

361
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,170
I've often seen your picture.

362
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,880
You're the daughter of
Sir George Fenwick, aren't you?

363
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,960
Yes.

364
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,800
It's about my father that I...

365
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,420
What about your
father, Ms. Fenwick?

366
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,510
Oh, I don't know what to do.

367
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,970
He's always been the
nicest, dearest person,

368
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,100
only since Mother died...

369
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,640
Yes, yes, we know.

370
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,980
So I didn't think anything of it

371
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,690
when he was away
the night before last.

372
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,320
But he didn't come home
until yesterday at teatime.

373
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Didn't come in
for dinner at all.

374
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,820
Just paced up and down in the
library, hour after hour.

375
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,660
I begged him to let me in,
but he wouldn't!

376
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,490
Steady, steady.

377
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,370
Now, take your time.

378
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,000
I couldn't sleep
a wink last night.

379
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Then I started hearing things.

380
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,300
Hearing things,
what sort of things?

381
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,630
I heard someone in the garden

382
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,510
underneath my window.

383
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,720
<i>Then I saw a figure moving</i>
down the garden path.

384
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,390
<i>And I recognized</i>
my father, 

385
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,300
<i>stealing through his</i>
own garden like a thief.

386
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,860
<i>He had a spade</i>
in his hand, 

387
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,510
<i>and he stopped by the greenhouse</i>
where he started to dig.

388
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,320
This morning at daybreak,
I strolled on to the garden,

389
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,440
and found this.

390
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,800
A finger,

391
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,590
a human finger.

392
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,300
Ring up Scotland Yard,
will you, Watson?

393
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,800
Ask them to get a hold
of Inspector Gregson,

394
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,010
and tell him to
meet us at once at

395
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,510
Sir George Fenwick's
house in Kingston.

396
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Operator?

397
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,340
Give me Scotland Yard, quick!

398
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,730
Where's my father, Norris?

399
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,020
He's still in the library, Miss.

400
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,520
Thank you, we'll
see him right away.

401
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,570
- Will you come with me, please?
- Thank you.

402
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,860
I got your message, Mr. Holmes.

403
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
Yes, indeed.

404
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,610
Dad, may I come in?

405
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,750
Dad?

406
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,170
That's funny.

407
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,880
He doesn't answer.

408
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,960
Do you mind?

409
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,530
- Please do.
- Thank you.

410
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,970
Watson, quick!

411
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,130
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
- Come along, my dear.

412
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,340
Take charge of
Miss Fenwick, please.

413
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,690
Now Miss Fenwich,
come along with me.

414
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,980
Dead?

415
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,020
Yes.

416
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,650
What do you make of it, Doctor?

417
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,030
Shot in the back, between
the second and third ribs.

418
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,610
The bullet undoubtedly
penetrated the heart.

419
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,660
Look at the powder
marks on his coat.

420
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,990
I was afraid of this.

421
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,160
What do you mean?

422
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,410
Don't you remember
the man in the cab

423
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,160
who followed Miss
Fenwick to Baker Street?

424
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,370
Well, you don't think he had
anything to do with it, do you?

425
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,790
Well, I think it's
reasonable to assume

426
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,590
that he tipped off someone
that I've been sent for.

427
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,920
Sir George has
obviously been murdered

428
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,670
to keep him from
telling me what he knew.

429
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,090
What was the weapon used?

430
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,510
Small caliber revolver,

431
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,140
point-blank range by
the look of the wound.

432
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,640
The murderer came in through
those French windows.

433
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,810
Look at the mud from the garden
he brought in on his boots.

434
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,150
Sir George must have
surprised the intruder

435
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,540
and crossed the
room to him here.

436
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,610
What follows, we can't tell.

437
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,690
But from the
location of the wound,

438
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,280
I'd say that he turned
his back for a moment,

439
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,360
and as he turned,

440
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,240
the muzzle of the revolver
was placed between his ribs

441
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,290
and one muffled shot fired.

442
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,040
And you mean to say he kept on
going even after he was shot?

443
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,500
There's no doubt
about it. Look there.

444
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,960
A trail of blood leads
us back to the desk.

445
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
There's something
Sir George was after.

446
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,130
Some thing.

447
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,220
I know, he was trying to
summon help, poor chap.

448
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,640
I don't think so, Watson.

449
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,110
There's the bell pull
by the fireplace.

450
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,350
No, you'll notice from
the trail of blood

451
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,810
that Sir George made
straight for this desk here.

452
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,440
I wonder...

453
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,730
there was something he was
desperately anxious to get.

454
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,320
Hello. His right
hand is clenched.

455
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,700
That's perfectly natural.
Death agony.

456
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,780
The left hand lies open.

457
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,250
Why only one hand clenched
in the death agony?

458
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,750
The right hand, the
hand nearest the desk.

459
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,670
Please note that.

460
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,130
If Sir George took
something off this desk,

461
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,380
something so important that he spilled
his last drop of blood to get it,

462
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,080
I want to know what it is.

463
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,570
It's nothing but an
ordinary match folder.

464
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,780
Where does that lead us?

465
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,450
I imagine to something
very important, Gregson.

466
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,280
This match folder is
from Pembroke House.

467
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,910
Why shouldn't it be?

468
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,370
He was there, you know?

469
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,700
We saw him yesterday.

470
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,410
Yes, but the effort he
made after he was shot

471
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,580
to get hold of
this match folder.

472
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,080
It's just possible,

473
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,750
he wanted someone to
remember Pembroke House.

474
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,380
He may have wished to recall it
to someone who saw him there.

475
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,680
Someone who like ourselves,

476
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,140
saw him with a woman.

477
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,610
Come in.

478
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,780
Oh, Dr. Watson,

479
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,700
this came by hand for Mr. Holmes

480
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,160
not ten minutes ago.

481
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,930
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

482
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,580
That would be the report
from Sir George's bank.

483
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,380
Report from... Oh, really?

484
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,590
Don't you remember
his daughter told us

485
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,630
that he just closed his account?

486
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,560
Had it looked into at once.

487
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,770
He drew out his
entire balance in cash,

488
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,350
nearly 10,000 pounds, yesterday,

489
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,600
just after that young
woman was murdered.

490
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,060
What does that
suggest to you, Watson?

491
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,650
- That he paid it out to someone.
- Precisely.

492
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,650
I smell the faint,
sweet odor of blackmail.

493
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,030
You don't think
he paid it out to someone

494
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,740
who saw him murder
the McLean woman?

495
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,120
Sir George never
murdered anyone.

496
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,780
But he did have
that woman's finger,

497
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,410
evidently, he did have to
pay out a lot of cash.

498
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,830
That's the terrifying part
about blackmail, Watson.

499
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,880
The victim is afraid to fight the
accusation no matter how false.

500
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,340
Once the accusation is made,

501
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,380
the name is smeared,

502
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,430
and sometimes
his life is ruined.

503
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,100
Well, if Sir George didn't
commit these murders,

504
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,640
what fiend did?

505
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,520
I rather think they're not
the work of any one man.

506
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,850
Oh, come Holmes, you
don't expect me to believe

507
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,310
there's a whole organization
going about killing people

508
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,310
and chopping off their fingers?

509
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,480
Well, it's possible,
quite possible.

510
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,740
Well, whoever's behind all this
thing must be out of his mind.

511
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,410
On the contrary, my dear fellow.

512
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,740
If my assumptions are correct,

513
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,910
this little scheme has behind it

514
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,990
the most brilliant and ruthless
intellect the world has ever known.

515
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,620
You don't mean
Professor Moriarity?

516
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,040
I do.

517
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,290
Oh, steady, Holmes, you've
got him on the brain.

518
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,960
This is the third time
in as many months

519
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,380
you've suspected him
of unsolved crimes.

520
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,840
- He's dead, you know?
- Is he?

521
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,460
"Is he?" You know he is.

522
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,050
He was hanged in Montevido
well over a year ago.

523
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,260
I heard that someone was hanged
in Montevido under that name,

524
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,010
but I'll stake my reputation

525
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,930
that Moriarity is alive

526
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,530
and here, now, in London.

527
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,730
Hello?

528
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,690
Yes, Dr. Watson, wait a minute.

529
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,690
Who, me?

530
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,860
Well, yes.

531
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,870
This is Dr. Watson speaking.

532
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,830
No, no, I'm afraid I've retired,

533
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,950
I don't practice anymore.

534
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,870
What?

535
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,120
Oh, that's a different thing.

536
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,750
An emergency case.

537
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,120
Where? Just a minute.

538
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,880
Yes. Yes, well, see
that she's not moved.

539
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,130
Remember that.

540
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,220
Don't touch her
'til I get there.

541
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,510
Fracture case in McArthur Mews.

542
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,680
Heavy woman.

543
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,090
14 stone.

544
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,730
Look at all this dust.

545
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,650
14 stone.

546
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,650
Just the sort of person who wouldn't
hoist herself up on a stool

547
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,400
to feed the canary.

548
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,450
There ought to be a
law against fat people

549
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,270
keeping little dickey birds.

550
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,120
So long, old man,
I shan't be very long.

551
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,660
Haven't used that bag

552
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,460
since I brought little Amelia
Watson into the world.

553
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,540
She grew up to be a
very unattractive child.

554
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,190
Huh, who wouldn't with a name like Amelia.
Amelia, huh.

555
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, Professor Moriarity.

556
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,290
Not that I wish
to appear inquisitive,

557
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,000
but to what am I indebted
to the pleasure of this visit?

558
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,630
Scotland Yard
will be interested.

559
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,220
It's very convenient for me
to have Scotland Yard think

560
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,760
that I am still dead
in Montevideo.

561
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,390
I never dreamed of fooling you.

562
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,560
Thank you.

563
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,180
The thought occurs
to me, Mr. Holmes,

564
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,770
that there are some advantages

565
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,960
in living within the law.

566
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,780
You are very comfortably
fixed here, aren't you?

567
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,570
As I get on in life,

568
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,360
the little comforts

569
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,030
appeal to me more and more.

570
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,040
Oh, I beg your pardon,
won't you sit down?

571
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,600
Thank you.

572
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,600
And now, Professor Moriarity,
what can I do for you?

573
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,060
Everything that
I have to say to you

574
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,390
has already crossed your mind.

575
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,690
And my answer has no
doubt crossed yours?

576
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,150
That's final?

577
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,230
What do you think?

578
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,780
I shall not rest until you are
hanged for the finger murders.

579
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,120
You've no proof, you know?

580
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,830
No, not a shred,

581
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,700
but I have you.

582
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,370
I could turn you over to
the police, here and now.

583
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,920
You could.

584
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,250
But if you did,

585
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,840
you'd never see
Dr. Watson again.

586
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,970
Oh, the telephone call?

587
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,420
Quite.

588
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,140
I rather assumed you had
taken some such precaution.

589
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,100
Or, I should have
snatched up a revolver

590
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,640
and indulged in a fit of
heroics when you came in.

591
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,350
Very smart, aren't you?

592
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,310
Not smart enough,

593
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,650
or I should have
anticipated you.

594
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,070
But, if any harm
comes to Dr. Watson,

595
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,780
I shall seek you out.

596
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,200
I shall not rest
until I find you,

597
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,490
and when I do...

598
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,490
No harm will come to
Dr. Watson this time,

599
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,080
but I can't answer
for the future.

600
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,620
Mr. Holmes, I should strongly
advise you to drop this case.

601
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,920
Don't be silly.

602
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,500
Think it over.

603
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,800
We've had many
encounters in the past.

604
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,760
You hope to place
me on the gallows.

605
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,510
I tell you, I shall never
stand up on the gallows.

606
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,350
But if you are
instrumental in any way

607
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,140
in bringing about
my destruction,

608
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,140
you will not be alive to
enjoy your satisfaction.

609
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,150
And we shall walk together through
the gates of eternity hand-in-hand.

610
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,440
- What a charming picture that would make.
- Yes, wouldn't it?

611
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,980
And I really think
it might be worth it.

612
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,620
Shoelaces Governor,
Two pence a pair.

613
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,410
And strong enough
to hang yourself.

614
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,830
How many more
times must I tell you,

615
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,090
I don't want your filthy
shoelaces or your company.

616
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,460
- Shoelaces, Governor?
- Blasted impertinence.

617
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,550
Run along my good man,
or I'll give you a charge.

618
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:21,550
Shoelaces, Governor?

619
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:26,100
Help a poor bloke
what's only got one arm?

620
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,520
Any luck with Mr. Holmes?

621
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,540
You can read his obituary
in tomorrow's papers.

622
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,700
Oh, there you are,
Watson, come in.

623
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,120
I was just going
out to look for you.

624
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,250
Look for me, what for?

625
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,170
I suppose you don't think
I know my way about.

626
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,540
Well, you're right, I don't.

627
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,500
Blast all practical
jokers, anyhow.

628
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,050
Know where I've been?

629
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,380
- On a wild goose chase.
- Exactly.

630
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,720
There's no such number
in McArthur's Mews.

631
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,470
Some fool's idea of a joke.

632
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,720
Did you ah...

633
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Did you see anyone?

634
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,180
No, nobody special.

635
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,730
Only a whining old
idiot selling bootlaces.

636
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,270
Persistent beggar, wasn't he?

637
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,770
Stuck to you like grim death.

638
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,650
How do you know?

639
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,110
And finally left you for someone
that looked like better pickings.

640
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,530
Someone, my dear Watson,

641
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,990
- was Professor Moriarity himself.
- What?

642
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,120
He just called on me.

643
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,700
Moriarity here,
and you let him go?

644
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,450
But you must be
out of your mind.

645
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,540
Why?

646
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,960
Well, he bluffed
me into believing

647
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,290
that he was holding a
friend of mine as hostage.

648
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,710
Friend of yours, who?

649
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,460
Oh, nobody very important,
just a fat, lazy fellow.

650
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,500
Medical man, I believe.

651
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,750
Medical man, do I know him?

652
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,130
Ah, yes, I think you do.

653
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,130
Fellow by the name of Watson.

654
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,170
Watson, Watson, never heard...

655
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,220
Who, me?

656
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,550
I'm afraid so, old fellow.

657
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,970
Your street hawker's job

658
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,100
was to do away with you

659
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,640
under a certain contingency.

660
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,190
And you let Moriarity
go because of me?

661
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,610
I had no choice.

662
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,730
I can't afford to
lose you, old fellow.

663
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,490
Well, that's very decent of
you, old chap, I must say.

664
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,160
But I wish you'd nabbed him.

665
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,490
We shall, never fear.

666
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,490
I know the motive for
the finger murders.

667
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,080
All I have to find out now is the
method used for the blackmail victims.

668
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,040
Method?

669
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,670
Yes.

670
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,460
How does Moriarity get them
to the scene of the crime?

671
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,550
How does he plant those
severed fingers on them?

672
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,880
And how does he scare
them into believing that

673
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,600
they may have committed those
atrocious murders themselves?

674
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Curious.

675
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,250
Very curious.

676
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,190
Curious, what's curious?

677
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,420
That window in the empty
house across the street,

678
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,660
first floor front.

679
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,620
Oh, what's wrong with it?

680
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,040
It's open.

681
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,790
Why shouldn't it be open?

682
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,000
It wasn't open half an hour ago,

683
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'll stake my life on that.

684
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,920
Oh? It's not our business.

685
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,550
Let it stay open.

686
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,590
I wonder if you'd
go over, old fellow,

687
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,010
and see what's the matter.

688
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,590
Trespassing, against the law.

689
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,010
Very well, I'll go myself.

690
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,970
Well, if you're going
to put it like that.

691
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,680
Ridiculous waste of time,

692
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,850
going about shutting windows
at this hour of the night.

693
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,980
Here, you better
take this torch.

694
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,440
Huh? Take what...

695
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,610
Hmm, dignified job for a doctor.

696
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,400
Dr. Watson, the torchbearer!

697
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,190
And what do you propose to do,

698
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,740
sit in a comfortable chair, I
suppose, and read a good book?

699
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,950
- That's a very good idea.
- Yes, a very good idea.

700
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,740
While I play night watchman,
you have a nice read.

701
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Good night, have a good time.

702
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,200
Have a good time...

703
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,450
I say.

704
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,860
What on earth is this for?

705
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,490
Oh, umbrella stand.

706
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,450
Pretty little thing to
keep about the house.

707
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,820
Must have been a pet.

708
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,710
What was that?

709
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,120
Rat probably.

710
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,370
While he sits comfortably
reading a book, humph.

711
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,050
<i>Drop it!</i>

712
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,340
He killed Holmes!
He killed Sherlock...

713
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,460
Watson.

714
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,670
You?

715
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,170
But I saw him shoot
you a second ago!

716
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,880
Not me, my dear fellow.

717
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,760
Merely the bust
of Julius Caesar.

718
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,640
Incidentally, you may have noticed
that all through the ages,

719
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,600
prominent men have
prominent noses. Shh.

720
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,230
Oh, I'm afraid we're
in for terrible trouble

721
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,520
again with Mrs. Hudson

722
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,070
window smashed, plaster
all over the floor.

723
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,270
Get up, you.

724
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,240
Corporal Williams,
Middlesex Regiment.

725
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,950
Discharged from the Army
as physically unfit.

726
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,560
Hmm, papers seem in order.

727
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
Now, Corporal Williams,

728
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,670
you've seen service in
the Far East, haven't you?

729
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,340
The East.

730
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,680
I thought so.

731
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,720
Look at his complexion,
Watson. Yellow saffron.

732
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
He's been taking atabrine,

733
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,180
a cure for malaria.

734
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,390
Sniper, aren't you?

735
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,980
Sniper.

736
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,600
Hmm.

737
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,690
Why did you try to kill me?

738
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,320
I had to kill him.

739
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,820
I had to.

740
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,740
- Oh, snap out of it!
- Stop it, Watson.

741
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,200
- He's shamming.
- No, he isn't.

742
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,370
Who told you to kill me?

743
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,040
She told me.

744
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,750
She told you?

745
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,250
She told me I couldn't miss.

746
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,920
Well, luckily you did
miss, you murderer.

747
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,740
He isn't a murderer, Watson.

748
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,800
Listen, Corporal Williams.

749
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,550
She told you you had
to do it, didn't she?

750
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,890
I had to do it.

751
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,180
I've got it, Watson,
I've got it!

752
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,390
Got what?

753
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,810
The method used in
the finger murders.

754
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,980
Well, what is it?

755
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,520
Hypnotism, my dear
fellow, hypnotism.

756
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,190
And it wasn't
against his nature,

757
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,990
that's the devilish part of it.

758
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,280
They picked a man
for that purpose

759
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,240
whose job was sniping.

760
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,570
Who are they?

761
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,830
Professor Moriarity and
his finger murderers.

762
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,290
Williams spoke of a woman.

763
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,790
I think you'll find that she asked
him home tonight for a drink.

764
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,920
Nice, quiet rooms,

765
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,210
soft lights, music.

766
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,510
You've got it all
packed, Mr. Holmes.

767
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,010
What's the lady look like?

768
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:01,140
About 30, nice figure,
blond, lustrous eyes.

769
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,680
Oh, really?
Got her phone number?

770
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,240
Oh. Oh, sorry.

771
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,520
Williams will
give us her address.

772
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,810
Look after him, Gregson.

773
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,190
Don't let anyone come near him.

774
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,190
He's our key witness
in the finger murders.

775
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,990
Well, I hope you're
guessing right, Mr. Holmes.

776
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,710
Get up, Williams.

777
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,910
Now, go with Inspector Gregson
anywhere he tells you.

778
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,370
Come on.

779
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,260
Ring me as soon as he comes
to himself, will you?

780
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,010
I will.

781
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,420
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

782
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,800
Well, if you believe that
fellow Williams was hypnotized,

783
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,430
I suppose you think Sir George
Fenwick was hypnotized, too?

784
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,680
I'm quite sure of it.
Have a cup of tea?

785
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,560
Thanks, old boy, nothing to eat?

786
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,980
But why didn't these people make
Sir George do the murder himself?

787
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,110
Because they didn't
want to get him hanged.

788
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,030
They wanted to blackmail him.

789
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,660
Well, who do you think
the actual murderer is?

790
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,580
One of Moriarity's gang.

791
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,200
A diabolically simple technique.

792
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,500
Kill a woman.

793
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,620
Yes, yes, yes, but why
cut off the fingers?

794
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,540
My dear fellow,
don't you understand?

795
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,800
The severed finger is what links the
blackmail victim to the murder.

796
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,210
He wakes,

797
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,590
finds the grizzly
thing in his pocket,

798
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,880
doesn't know how it got there.

799
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,260
He has no idea that
he's been hypnotized.

800
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,180
For all he knows,

801
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,140
he may have committed
the atrocious crime

802
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,390
during some dreadful
lapse of sanity.

803
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,520
In that state when he's
utterly demoralized,

804
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,610
the blackmailers
take over, is that it?

805
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,940
Undoubtedly. You see,

806
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,650
they swear that they saw
him commit the murder.

807
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,320
And being human, the
victim will pay anything

808
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,990
rather than stand
trial on a charge

809
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,870
that will make his
very name loathsome.

810
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,410
Well, it all fits in

811
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,740
if you believe in hypnotism.

812
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,620
The only possible explanation.

813
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,790
And you think the
hypnotist is that

814
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,460
woman with the blond hair,
the lustrous eyes,

815
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,670
the woman you invented.

816
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,510
I didn't invent her, I saw her.

817
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,970
What on earth
are you talking about?

818
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,050
That woman, my dear Watson,

819
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,180
was with Sir George when
he left Pembroke House.

820
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,220
I saw her there.

821
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,180
I shall see her again,

822
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,020
and Williams will
lead me to her.

823
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
That's why it's so
important to keep him safe.

824
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,530
He will identify her.

825
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,650
Hello?

826
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,310
Yes, Inspector Gregson.

827
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,530
What?

828
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,080
Well, get every
constable in the District.

829
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,540
Yes, I'll be over at once.

830
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,040
- What's happened, Holmes?
- Williams is missing.

831
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,020
- Great Scott!
- Come on.

832
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,340
A lorry crashed
into Gregson's car

833
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,680
during the confusion,
Williams disappeared.

834
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,720
- Escaped, huh?
- No, kidnapped,

835
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,100
to keep him from
talking when he came to.

836
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,510
You don't think
that Moriarity...

837
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,490
With Moriarity,
anything is possible.

838
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,900
Williams!

839
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,230
Dead.

840
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,310
You see, anything is possible.

841
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,300
Oh. Good morning,
Professor Moriarity.

842
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,350
You startled me.

843
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,680
I'm dressing another dolly,

844
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,440
a dear little nurse.

845
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,310
Is there anything
wrong with your finger?

846
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,730
Just a splinter.

847
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,820
Nasty things splinters,

848
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,570
most trying.

849
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,910
One can't be too careful,

850
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,240
but I'll get it out for you.

851
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,190
I have the very
instrument to help you.

852
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,960
Sharp enough to split a hair.

853
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,250
Put those tools away
until they're needed.

854
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,260
But they're not tools,
sir, they're instruments.

855
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,800
Put them away.

856
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,050
Is Lydia in?

857
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,760
Yes.

858
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,060
But really, you should let me.

859
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,850
Get dressed.

860
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,560
Holmes and Watson just left Baker
Street for the Mesmer Club.

861
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,190
Mesmer Club?

862
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,770
The meeting place of all the
top hypnotists in London.

863
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,740
Do you suppose that Mr. Holmes
is on to our method?

864
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,610
If he suspects,

865
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,910
it's merely a suspicion.

866
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,280
It's our business to
see that it ends there.

867
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,950
I hope you're right.

868
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,910
Williams passed away before
he could talk, remember?

869
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,460
What do you want me to do?

870
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,080
Go to the Mesmer Club,
meet Holmes,

871
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,420
and induce him
to come back here.

872
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,630
Isn't that a bit dangerous?

873
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:52,180
Every meeting with Sherlock Holmes
is potentially dangerous.

874
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,890
However, you say he didn't see
your face at Pembroke House.

875
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,730
And how would you suggest I get
Mr. Holmes to accompany me here?

876
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,690
Kidnap him?

877
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,230
Oh, no.

878
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,030
Holmes has one weakness,
his insatiable curiosity.

879
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,990
If you can arouse that,
you can lead him anywhere.

880
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,450
It's up to you to take advantage

881
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,790
of any opportunity
that may arise.

882
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,830
This way, please, gentlemen.

883
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,500
I'll tell Dr. Onslow
that you're here.

884
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
Thank you.

885
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,460
So this is the Mesmer Club?

886
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,090
If you ask me, hypnotism
is a lot of mumbo-jumbo.

887
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,880
Oh, come now Watson,
as a medical man,

888
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,260
you must admit that hypnotism has
its place in modern science?

889
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,890
That may be, but 90
percent of hypnotists

890
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,470
are crooks of the worse kind.

891
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,680
Nothing more than
a lot of charlatans

892
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,100
exploiting weak-willed morons.

893
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,140
Ah, Dr. Onslow, I believe.

894
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,900
Happy to meet you, Mr. Holmes.

895
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,020
Your brother, Mycroft, suggested
I might be of help to you.

896
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,360
He's a valued member of our little
group of charlatans and crooks.

897
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,860
I beg your pardon, sir.

898
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,120
I didn't know you were
listening. Behind the curtain

899
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,990
- My friend, Dr. Watson.
- Ah, delighted.

900
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,660
- How do you do?
- I wonder now,

901
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,290
you see, we're in the midst of
a little experimental session

902
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,380
at this very moment,
if you'd care to join us.

903
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,210
- Oh, certainly, certainly.
- Might be very instructive.

904
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,710
Oh, well, will you follow me?

905
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,750
Thank you.

906
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,800
in treating his patients.

907
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,930
But today, the therapeutic
value of hypnotism,

908
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,470
as we now call it,

909
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,680
is conceded by
numerable physicians.

910
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,770
Especially of value
in surgical cases

911
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,150
where the administration of local or
of general anesthetic is inadvisable.

912
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,940
Inadvisable, poppycock!
Oh, sorry.

913
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,450
For the sake of latecomers,

914
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,070
I may say that I have
placed this subject

915
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,200
under profound hypnosis.

916
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,870
In this condition,
he can feel no pain,

917
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,290
even under applications which
normally would be excruciating.

918
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,210
Excruciating!

919
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:47,400
Will you excuse me, please.

920
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,260
Carter, you are having
a peaceful sleep,

921
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,170
you feel nothing.

922
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,390
Your arms and your hands
are without sensation.

923
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,420
Mobrey, the long needle.

924
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,370
Carter, give me your right hand.

925
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,990
As you observe,
the needle has been thrust

926
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,330
completely through
the subject's hand.

927
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,450
No feeling, no pain.

928
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,670
This lack of feeling is
the one infallible test

929
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,830
of profound hypnosis.

930
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,630
Nonsense.
Fellow's full of drugs.

931
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,510
Well, isn't he?

932
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,540
Definitely not, Doctor.

933
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
Wake up, Carter, wake up.

934
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,260
You'll feel well and
rested, remember,

935
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,810
no pain anywhere.

936
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,580
Wake up, wake up.

937
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:49,940
I say, when are
you going to begin?

938
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,390
All through, Carter, stand up.

939
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,220
This way, sir.

940
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,660
And, uh, are these all
the people that come here?

941
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,780
Oh, no, no.

942
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,660
Others keep dropping
in all the time.

943
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,540
I suppose it's all right for
those who believe in it but,

944
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,000
of course, I'm a
professional man myself.

945
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,790
Then you don't believe
in hypnotism, Dr. Watson?

946
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,960
Oh, I don't deny that
there's certain types

947
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,710
of hysterical
feeble-minded people,

948
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,970
who'll go under if you
point your finger at them.

949
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:20,050
But anyone with an
ounce of character.

950
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,890
How right you are.

951
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:25,180
You see right through our little
artifices, don't you, doctor?

952
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,180
Right through, my
dear sir, right through.

953
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,560
Quite so.

954
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,400
But with the
feeble-minded, as you say.

955
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,280
- Excuse us, Mr. Holmes.
- Oh, certainly.

956
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,650
Step over here won't you?

957
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:37,820
Certainly, anything to oblige.

958
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,160
Let me show you how easily

959
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,660
we charlatans take
advantage of them.

960
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,850
Now, sit down, Doctor.

961
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,290
Now, we set a thing
like this in motion.

962
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,630
It's wonderful, the attraction,

963
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,220
on the feeble-minded, of course.

964
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,430
The continuous motion,

965
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,890
if they just let
themselves follow it.

966
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,270
Of course, you could stare at it

967
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:11,940
'til Doomsday, Dr. Watson,

968
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,150
with no effect at all.

969
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,150
Still, it might make
you a little drowsy,

970
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,490
like the white
ribbon of road at night

971
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,330
when you're driving.

972
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,660
The rhythm is smooth,

973
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,120
unbroken,

974
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,540
and the road goes on and on

975
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,840
round and round,

976
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:43,180
always the same,
winding and winding.

977
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,350
And you're drowsy,

978
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,180
you're tired.

979
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,980
Let the road come
into you as it were.

980
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,270
The long road.

981
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,150
The smooth road.

982
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:01,150
The road to sleep,

983
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,970
sleep.

984
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,410
Open your eyes.

985
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,980
Stand up.

986
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,060
Turn around.

987
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,670
And now, Dr. Watson,

988
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,510
you're on a Holiday in Scotland.

989
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,350
The country is
amazingly beautiful.

990
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,770
We're coming to a stream.

991
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,560
It isn't deep.

992
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,210
Better take your
shoes and socks off.

993
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,890
Roll up your trouser.

994
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:59,170
That will do, the other
leg is waterproof.

995
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,880
Turn around.

996
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,340
Mind the pebbles!

997
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,420
Sit down.

998
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:15,550
Wake up now.

999
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,280
See, what did I tell you.
It didn't work with me.

1000
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,200
Why, nobody with an
ounce of charac...

1001
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,720
I think you'll need these.

1002
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,550
- Nothing to laugh at.
- Watson, she's here!

1003
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,130
Who? The woman
you're looking for?

1004
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,840
Yes, I'm going to meet her.

1005
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,970
Perhaps I can induce her
to take me to Moriarity.

1006
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,260
Do you think that's
wise, Holmes?

1007
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,350
May not be wise,
but it's essential.

1008
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,480
After all, I've held my own
with Moriarity in the past.

1009
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,810
But isn't it dangerous?
She might be a hypnotist.

1010
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,060
If my will isn't
stronger than hers,

1011
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,270
I deserve to be hypnotized. Shh!

1012
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,570
I feel I must protest,
Dr. Onslow.

1013
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,900
I was told this was a gathering of
serious students of a great science,

1014
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,860
and I find myself in
a company of buffoons.

1015
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,990
Oh, my dear...

1016
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:10,950
Elman and Esdaile are brave.

1017
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,790
Were those men
martyrs for the truth?

1018
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,160
But you may laugh over your
childish, cruel tricks.

1019
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,370
I must say, I'm in complete
agreement with you, madam.

1020
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,830
This was a most unnecessary
performance, Dr. Onslow.

1021
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,630
Beg your pardon, sir?

1022
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,590
My name is Holmes,
Sherlock Holmes.

1023
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,920
At your service, madam.

1024
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,550
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

1025
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,550
I'm afraid I've created a
rather embarrassing situation.

1026
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,850
But you see, I'm interested in
the serious study of hypnotism.

1027
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,350
So am I too.

1028
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,270
Perhaps we have something
in common, Mr. Holmes.

1029
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:36,730
Perhaps we have.

1030
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,060
Would you join me for a
cocktail at Pembroke House?

1031
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,900
I should be delighted.

1032
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,900
Good.

1033
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:56,950
Thank you.

1034
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,830
I didn't know there was such
a pleasant place in London.

1035
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:01,290
It was so nice of you to
suggest our coming here.

1036
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,460
I thought a little pick-me-up
would do us good.

1037
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,420
You mean, you
thought I looked...

1038
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,630
I like the way you look.

1039
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,830
Thank you.

1040
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,010
I suppose I did lose my head
a little at the Mesmer Club.

1041
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,260
But you see,

1042
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,810
hypnotism is almost
a religion with me.

1043
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:21,150
I know so well what it
can do to help and heal,

1044
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,480
and I can't bear to see it
used for trivial purposes.

1045
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,690
I know very little about it,

1046
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,030
that's why I went
to the Mesmer Club.

1047
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:28,030
You see, I'm rather
puzzled just now

1048
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,190
with a case that
I am working on.

1049
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,780
How fascinating,
Tell me about it.

1050
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,950
It's the murder
of Sir George Fenwick.

1051
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,660
Fenwick?

1052
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,740
Who's he?

1053
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,330
Quite a well-known figure.

1054
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,330
Odd, now I come to think of it.

1055
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,620
The last time I saw Sir George

1056
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,130
was here at Pembroke House.

1057
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,290
Strange.

1058
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,670
Yes, isn't it.

1059
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,510
He was sitting um,

1060
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:52,680
I believe he was sitting
at this very table.

1061
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,090
Cigarette?

1062
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,350
Thanks, do go on.

1063
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,020
There was a charming lady
with him.

1064
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,730
He was, um,

1065
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,680
he was lighting her cigarette.

1066
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,780
Charming. Did you see her face?

1067
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,240
No,

1068
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,030
merely her back.

1069
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,620
How unenterprising of you.

1070
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,030
Yes, wasn't it.

1071
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,790
Afraid I'm getting
a little older.

1072
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,250
I shouldn't say so.

1073
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,330
That's nice of you.

1074
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,080
Still, the first time in my life

1075
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,090
I've got a hold of a
case that's beyond me.

1076
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,420
I'm actually losing
sleep over it.

1077
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,670
You know, Mr. Holmes,

1078
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,670
I believe I could help you.

1079
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,880
Really?
I should be very grateful.

1080
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,340
You're amused?

1081
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,600
No, merely skeptical.

1082
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,600
How would you go about it?

1083
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,560
I've used hypnotism more
than once in healing.

1084
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,770
Not for profit,

1085
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,690
I'm not a professional.

1086
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,940
But I do think I could help you,

1087
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,030
if you'd care to...

1088
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,840
I can't think of a
pleasanter experience.

1089
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,500
Low lights, music,
is that all there is to it?

1090
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,920
You must relax, Mr. Holmes.

1091
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,790
I'm afraid you're a
rather difficult subject.

1092
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:22,180
So, I thought
perhaps a little help.

1093
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,810
Materia medica
might be advisable.

1094
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,960
Drugs?

1095
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,320
No, I'd rather not,
if you don't mind?

1096
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,360
As a matter of fact,
I'd rather not myself.

1097
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,780
But Schinknazin he practiced
in Munich, you know.

1098
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,080
Believed it the best means
for difficult subjects.

1099
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,660
Do you mind?

1100
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,460
Well, as a matter of fact,
I don't approve of sedatives.

1101
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,920
Just as you wish.

1102
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,080
We don't have to go on with
this at all, you know?

1103
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:54,980
Wait a minute.

1104
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,850
All right. I'll take a chance.

1105
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,310
It's really quite harmless.

1106
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,600
What is it?

1107
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,100
Cannabis Japonica,
an Oriental soporific.

1108
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,670
You'll need water.

1109
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,870
Thank you.

1110
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,680
Now sit down, Mr. Holmes.

1111
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,630
You'll feel yourself
going drowsy.

1112
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,420
Don't fight it.

1113
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,430
Give in to it.

1114
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:43,060
Because you do want
to sleep, you know?

1115
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:48,140
Just fix your eyes on
this one white flower,

1116
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,520
floating on the water.

1117
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,730
Empty your mind of
every other thought.

1118
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,740
Follow the motion of the water,

1119
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,280
so smooth,

1120
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,030
not a ripple.

1121
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,620
Waters of forgetfulness.

1122
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,670
Steady,

1123
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,800
deep,

1124
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,050
strong.

1125
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:20,300
Strange, isn't it,

1126
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,260
how the light is reflected.

1127
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:29,260
Little specks of light
that move and move.

1128
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,340
It's restful here.

1129
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,230
It's peaceful.

1130
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,780
It's friendly.

1131
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:49,000
And you're very close to finding
what you're looking for.

1132
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,870
You'll find them soon now,

1133
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,270
the guilty ones,

1134
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,440
when you're rested.

1135
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,760
Gentle waters closing over you.

1136
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,390
Steady,

1137
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,720
deep,

1138
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:12,480
strong.

1139
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,340
Drawing you down,

1140
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,180
down,

1141
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:22,090
down.

1142
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,380
Sleep,

1143
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,690
sleep,

1144
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,780
sleep.

1145
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:36,230
Here he is, Professor Moriarity.

1146
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,260
Stand up, Mr. Holmes.

1147
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,000
Open your eyes.

1148
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,120
Face this way.

1149
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,420
Are you satisfied?

1150
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,960
We're dealing with a clever man.

1151
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,250
He may be shamming.

1152
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,630
There's just one infallible test

1153
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,340
for profound hypnosis.

1154
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,220
You ready, Dr. Simnell?

1155
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,770
That will do, Doctor.

1156
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,570
He couldn't fake
insensibility to the knife.

1157
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:27,110
I congratulate you, Lydia.

1158
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,620
Turn around, Mr. Holmes.

1159
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,700
Now, walk to the desk.

1160
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:41,880
Sit down.

1161
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,590
Take that pen,

1162
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:46,340
and write what
I tell you to write.

1163
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,890
I've at last found a
case which I cannot solve.

1164
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:56,880
I have outlived my usefulness.

1165
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:05,220
Therefore, I have
decided to end my life.

1166
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,730
Sign your name.

1167
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,460
Now, blot it.

1168
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:21,620
Fold it up,

1169
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,090
and put it in your pocket.

1170
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,340
Come, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

1171
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,110
Go out onto the terrace.

1172
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,220
But it won't look
like suicide, sir.

1173
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,930
I'm sorry, but
Mr. Holmes' injuries

1174
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:40,440
must all be self-inflicted.

1175
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,240
Let's walk a little, Mr. Holmes.

1176
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,710
It's so pleasant
here in the garden.

1177
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,120
Just step up here
onto the terrace.

1178
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,520
It's a nice, broad terrace.

1179
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,040
Now, turn to the left

1180
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,120
and walk slowly to
the end of the terrace.

1181
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,220
Don't stop.

1182
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,620
You must walk to
the end, you know.

1183
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:27,690
The end leads
to an open doorway.

1184
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,190
You can pass through
it in perfect safety.

1185
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:32,030
In the room beyond the doorway,

1186
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,240
you'll find what
you're looking for.

1187
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,160
Must you drag this on?

1188
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,450
This is the moment I've been
anticipating for a long time, my dear.

1189
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,330
Go on, Mr. Holmes.

1190
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,300
Through the open doorway
you'll find the man

1191
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,340
responsible for
the finger murders

1192
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,930
and the death of
Sir George Fenwick.

1193
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,680
Professor Moriarity!

1194
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,820
<i>Holmes!</i>

1195
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,950
Stand still!

1196
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:02,270
What a beautiful view, Watson,

1197
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,440
I'm quite enjoying it.

1198
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,150
No, you're not.
You're hypnotized!

1199
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,560
You're under a spell.

1200
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,320
Stand still, don't move.

1201
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,860
Steady, Holmes, steady does it.

1202
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,320
Stand perfectly still
where you are.

1203
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,900
Nonsense, Watson.

1204
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,110
You don't know
what you're doing.

1205
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,700
Of course I know what I'm doing.

1206
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,780
- You mean, you're not hypnotized?
- Certainly not.

1207
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,370
Then get off the wall,
you idiot.

1208
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,980
Oh! Oh, God! Holmes!

1209
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,920
- Dear fellow.
- What were you doing out there?

1210
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,420
Holding the fort
until you arrived.

1211
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,500
What kept you?

1212
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,920
Oh, I ran into a spot of trouble

1213
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,800
on my way to Scotland Yard.

1214
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,050
I was arrested for
exceeding the speed limit.

1215
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,640
Your luck seems
to hold, Mr. Holmes.

1216
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,050
Well, I'd hardly
call it luck, Professor.

1217
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,760
You see, I substituted
a drug of my own

1218
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,890
for the one that this
dear lady pressed on me.

1219
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,520
You are clever, aren't you?

1220
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,940
A drug that, although it
leaves the subject conscious,

1221
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,900
it renders him quite
insensitive to pain.

1222
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,150
That accounted for my lack of
reaction to Dr. Simnells' knife.

1223
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,700
Well, Gregson,
quite an impressive haul.

1224
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,110
Even Inspector Lestrade himself

1225
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,370
couldn't have done any better.

1226
01:05:58,370 --> 01:05:59,870
- Thanks, Mr. Holmes.
- Take them away.

1227
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,760
All right, put her in the van.

1228
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,460
I was right, Mr. Holmes.

1229
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,370
You are a difficult subject.

1230
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,730
Thank you.

1231
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,670
And now, Professor,

1232
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,670
our score is settled.

1233
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,630
Au revoir until
I see you on the gallows.

1234
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,840
The rope has not been made
that'll go around my neck.

1235
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,990
Come on.

1236
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,850
Ah!

1237
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:35,860
I'll take care of things,
Mr. Holmes.

1238
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,950
Thank you, Inspector.

1239
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,950
Come on.

1240
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,990
An evil man, Holmes,
but what a horrible death.

1241
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,970
Better than he deserved.

1242
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:48,750
What are you thinking of?

1243
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,790
I'm thinking of all the women
who can come and go in safety

1244
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:54,420
in the streets
of London tonight.

1245
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,550
Stars keep watch
in their heavens,

1246
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,430
and in our own little way,
we, too, old friend,

1247
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:07,430
the privilege to
watch over our city.
