1
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,100
- Six years of hard training and actual battle experience

2
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,700
- in Spain and Poland had made the German Army look invincible.

3
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,980
- But what about the British and French?

4
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,820
- First, let's take up the British.

5
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,460
- They started from scratch,

6
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,880
- but both at home and abroad,

7
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,760
- an army was growing.

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,300
- For not only Britain had declared war,

9
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,800
- Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa,

10
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,240
- the whole British Commonwealth of Nations

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,200
- was also determined on victory over Hitlerism

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
- and all it stands for.

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
- And Britain had one weapon that was ready, the Royal Navy.

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
- Shortly after war was declared at its swept German shipping from the high seas.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
- And units of the British fleet were deployed at Suez, Malta, Gibraltar,

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,880
- in the Channel, and in the North Sea, blockading Germany.

17
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,960
- World conquest was impossible without running smack up against the rock called Britain.

18
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
- How to strike at that little island?

19
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
- That was the question.

20
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,640
- Between Britain and Germany stood not only France, but the little countries of Luxembourg,

21
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,000
- Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
- The people of these small, neutral countries were peaceful, hard-working, and free.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
- They knew they were in the middle and feared violation of their neutrality. Hitler knew this.

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,880
- He also knew that if they united with the Allies, they would form a solid

25
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,400
- democratic wall against Nazi aggression, and their conquest would be far more difficult.

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,200
- So before striking with his armies, he used another weapon, the propaganda barrage, to

27
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:47,000
- confuse, to make them lose faith, to divide and conquer. To lull the fears of the little neutrals propaganda minister

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
- Gurbels told them Germany didn't want to war at all.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
- It was Britain and France that caused all the trouble.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
- Then it was Hitler's turn.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:10,720
- In the speech on October 6, 1939, he made the more kinds of specific promises. To the day he said, "We have concluded a non-aggression pact with Denmark."

32
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,240
- To the Norwegians he said, "Germany never had any conflict with the Northern States

33
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,040
- and has none today."

34
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,240
- To the Dutch he said, "The new Reich is endeavor to continue the traditional friendship

35
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
- with Holland.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
- And to the Belgians he announced, the Reich has put forth no claim which might in any way be regarded as a threat to Belgium.

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
- And while Hitler was making these promises, his generals were cold bloodedly picking out the first victim, Norway.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,560
- And why did they pick Norway?

39
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,960
- It's many steep inlets or fjords would make excellent U-boat

40
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,360
- bases, from which raiders could prey on British supply

41
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,600
- lines.

42
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,200
- Also, it would give the Nazis vital air bases.

43
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
- This is a scape-flow British naval base,

44
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,000
- and this the blockade fleet.

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- At this time, the German-based bombers couldn't reach them.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
- Possession of bases on Norway's western shore would bring these vital British defenses under easy bomber attack.

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
- But he couldn't take Norway without also taking tiny Denmark, the springboard for his attack.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
- So a dawn on April 9, 1940.

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
- The German Army rolled across the neutral borders of little Denmark,

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
- and in a matter of hours it occupied the entire country.

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
- By nightfall, Denmark is erased as a nation,

52
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
- and the Danes go into slavery.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,800
- Although only six months before Hitler had announced, we have concluded an unaggression

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
- pact with Denmark.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
- The Danes will not forget.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,720
- Meanwhile in Norway, peaceful looking German merchant ships like these had sneaked inside Norway's neutral waterway and tied up at all principal ports.

57
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,420
- That is, they looked like merchant ships.

58
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,120
- But if the Norwegians had had X-ray eyes, this is what they would have seen.

59
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,120
- The Trojan horse of ancient Greece brought up to date with new and deadlier weapons.

60
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,640
- At the precise moment that the Nazis overran Denmark,

61
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,880
- these quiet-looking ships sprang to life.

62
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,400
- At the same time, Nazi warships discovered

63
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,000
- along the entire coastline, started steaming up the Norwegian fjords.

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:00,000
- Ships, transports, tanks, men, planes, all flung themselves simultaneously upon a defenseless country.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
- Airborne infantry seized every strategic Norwegian airport.

66
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
- The whole job was made easier by treacherous fifth columnists,

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
- led by Major Quisling, who seized power and issued orders to suppress resistances.

68
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
- Maxi warships steamed past silent guns that could have blasted them out of the war.

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
- This was one of the most amazing acts of treachery the world has ever known.

70
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
- It brought Major Quisling international fame, making his very name synonymous with the word traitor.

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:52,000
- By the afternoon of April 9th, the Germans were in complete control of all seven ports where they had landed in the morning.

72
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
- For the first time in more than 200 years, the people of Norway saw an invading army parading through their cities.

73
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,280
- Many of these Nazi soldiers strutting his conquerors in 1940, at last seen Norway some 20 years earlier.

74
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,240
- When this refugee German children they had been raised and cared for

75
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
- by kind Norwegians.

76
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,160
- Now these same Germans were back to repay that kindness with terror

77
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,760
- and destruction.

78
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,320
- Once they had occupied the capital, the Nazis quickly found out in all directions.

79
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:38,240
- But loyal Norwegian troops stopped one German column between Hamar and El Veron.

80
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
- So the Germans brought up their bombers? The Norwegians were forced to flee to the north,

81
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
- under constant and none-aposed air attack.

82
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,500
- It was here that Captain Robert Lose, an American military

83
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,000
- attire was killed.

84
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
- The first American soldier to lose his life in this war.

85
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
- Meanwhile, the Nazis had spread all over the country.

86
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
- Small patrols occupied every strategic village.

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
- Parachute troops landed high in the mountains.

88
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:22,760
- Unaposed bombing raids sent defenseless civilians fleeing in stark terror. They hadn't wandered more.

89
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,000
- They had done everything to avoid it.

90
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
- Hoping they could escape the Nazi scourge, they had compromised,

91
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
- and tragically failed to unite with the other democracies.

92
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
- And now they faced the scourge defenseless and alone.

93
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
- Or before the Allies could come to their aid, the Germans were in control of all principal forts.

94
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
- Regardless of this, British, French, and Polish contingents

95
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
- plunged in and made several landings

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
- along the Norwegian coast.

97
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
- They landed forces north and south of

98
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
- Trondheim and attempted an

99
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
- uncertain movement on the city,

100
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
- under constant heavy and almost

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
- entirely on the whole dare attack.

102
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,880
- and almost entirely on the pole's dare attack.

103
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,200
- Well, the scene of action was out of range of British fighter planes.

104
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,000
- So they brought up aircraft carriers.

105
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,640
- But these are out of disadvantage when a pole's by land-based planes.

106
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,760
- The Allies therefore were badly battered from the air.

107
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
- Finally, suffering heavy losses, they withdrew from a hopeless situation. Further to the North, at Narvik, they met with better success,

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:12:04,000
- inflicting heavy naval losses on the Nazis.

109
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
- They made landings and held the town for nearly two months.

110
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
- Incidentally, they also took their first prisoners at the present war.

111
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,600
- While our regions were left with their chrisbings, their ruins, their debt, even though six months before Hitler had said

112
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,200
- Germany never had any conflict with the northern states and has none today

113
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,040
- The Norwegians will not forget and Hitler

114
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,540
- Hitler had another victory. it hijacked two more countries the world wondered and sometimes marvel at this man's efficiency

115
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,100
- gangsta dillinger was efficient too

116
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,760
- when a man ordination throws away all regard for the laws of God and man, he is bound

117
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,920
- at first to be more efficient than his victims.

118
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,360
- Society had a police force to deal with a gangster delinger, but it had no police force

119
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,720
- to deal with gangster Hitler.

120
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,640
- So he clubbed Norway into submission and got what he wanted, bases for use against Britain.

121
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,000
- Now he had the Northern Claw of an enormous pinter movement.

122
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
- A drive through France would give him the southern claw.

123
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
- Blockade by you boats, coupled with masked bombing attacks,

124
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- would weaken the British for final invasion.

125
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
- Then, with Britain gone, Germany could reach out in all directions for world conquest.

126
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
- His next move must obviously be through France,

127
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
- to get his southern claw.

128
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
- Through France,

129
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
- how was she to face the arms slot?

130
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
- These scenes are ancient history.

131
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
- They occurred in 1914.

132
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
- The German armies without warning had smashed across neutral Belgium.

133
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
- Invaded France, reached the River Marne only a few miles from Paris.

134
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
- Out of the French capital poured the French reserves,

135
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
- riding out to battle the enemy in every vehicle that could move.

136
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
- Famous taxicab army.

137
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,100
- Note well, it was riding out too fast.

138
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,340
- In the center of the French lines to the ninth French army,

139
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,700
- commanded by a then comparatively unknown general.

140
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,540
- On September 5th, 1914, he is reputed to have said,

141
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,100
- "My right is driven in.

142
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
- My center is giving way.

143
00:15:44,100 --> 00:16:21,320
- The situation is excellent. I attack. The German armstop was checked, and Parris was saved. That comparatively unknown

144
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,280
- general later became Commander-in-Chief,, all the Allied armies, and presided for signing of the Honestess

145
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,880
- with the defeated Germans on November 11, 1918.

146
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,480
- To this general, the French people erected the monument.

147
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,960
- The Marshall Ferdinand Folche, whose model was "a type, always a type."

148
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
- Still later, the war weary French people erected another monument.

149
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
- This one to a minister of war, Andre Maginot.

150
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
- Between the ideas symbolized by these two statues,

151
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
- they well lie the military story of the fall of a great nation.

152
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
- In posthus time, the proud spirit of France demanded nothing less than victory

153
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
- and placed its faith in the attack.

154
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
- In Maginot's time, the spirit no longer proud,

155
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,840
- asked only to avoid defeat and placed its faith in concrete.

156
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,100
- So the French built the mighty chain of fortresses

157
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,640
- called the Maginot Line.

158
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,220
- These tremendous bastions were built deep into the French land.

159
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,300
- They were connected by underground passages and railways,

160
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,000
- guarding France's eastern borders facing Germany.

161
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
- And when France was finally forced to declare war against the rising Nazi menace,

162
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:07,140
- the French troops, instead of attacking, were marched into their modern caves to wait for the Nazi blitz to smash itself against the Maginoline. Their generals headed by Marshall Payter,

163
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,380
- proudly announced, whoever makes the first move

164
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,780
- in this war will be hurt.

165
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,980
- But Hitler didn't go near the Maginoline.

166
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,620
- That was France's strong point.

167
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,280
- Instead he attacked the weak point.

168
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,480
- Hitler knew that the French had tried to avoid war instead of preparing for it.

169
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,000
- That knowledge was one of his greatest weapons.

170
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
- He knew they had planes, but he knew they were antiquated.

171
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,520
- He knew they had tanks, but he knew they were few in number and lightly armored.

172
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,000
- But most important of all, he knew that France had become a cynical and disillusioned nation.

173
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
- What made this change in the French spirit?

174
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
- In the first place between 1914 and 1918, the French suffered more than six million casualties,

175
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
- in the heroic defense of their land against German invasion.

176
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,680
- The flower of an entire generation was lost,

177
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,600
- with its stimulus of new blood, new determination,

178
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,960
- new ideals.

179
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,520
- Secondly, the failure of the League of Nations,

180
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,000
- to which the French had pinned their hopes of peace,

181
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
- the corruption of many in high places,

182
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,000
- the greed of special interests, all had

183
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
- combined to shake the faith of the French people in their democratic ideals,

184
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
- and one of people loses its faith in its own ideals.

185
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
- It is right for the insidious words of the devil.

186
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
- France still looked like an imposing castle, but Hitler's political termites have so nought away the binding of national unity,

187
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
- that the castle was ready to crumble.

188
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
- And during those months of military and activity that we call the "Pony War," a ceaseless barrage of German propaganda crossed the still waters of the Rhine

189
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
- to affect the soldiers in the Maginoline.

190
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:31,000
- Why do you fight as the banners? Palms and friendly notes were sent over by balloons.

191
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
- French tunes were played by German bands.

192
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
- And German cooling was broadcast in French.

193
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
- The British will fight to the last drop of French blood.

194
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
- You have been deceived.

195
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
- This is an imperialistic war of the Britain.

196
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
- We Germans want nothing of France.

197
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
- What is happening to your wives back home soldiers?

198
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
- The British are stationed in your villages.

199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
- Yes, France was ready to be plucked.

200
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
- The whole force of the Nazi Mike was turned toward the west. How would they strike this time?

201
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
- Through Alsace, Lorraine is in 1870.

202
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
- Through the Hmong countries, as in 1914.

203
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,840
- What was the 1940 model conquest?

204
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,240
- The French considered the Maginoline utterly impregnable.

205
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,160
- And therefore, I believe the Germans would again

206
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,000
- try to swing through the low countries as in 1914.

207
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,160
- But even after Hitler's rape of Scandinavia, Holland and Belgium

208
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,520
- hoping against hope still plung to their neutrality.

209
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,900
- So the French mass 78 divisions here

210
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,300
- along the border to Belgium.

211
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,100
- 17 were in the Maginot Line.

212
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,580
- 10 divisions here in Case Mussolini got bold.

213
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,820
- Three and a half was a safeguard against Spain.

214
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,780
- The British had 10 divisions here.

215
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,940
- The Allied strategy and the event of an attack

216
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,500
- against the low countries was to swing their

217
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,240
- armies like a gate into Belgium, the hinge being the north end of the Maginot Line.

218
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,680
- This all-important hinge was protected by the forest of the Ardenne, a hilly and thickly

219
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:25,000
- wooded area, honeycombed with streams, its roads narrow trails, it's bridges too weak for military vehicles.

220
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
- French strategists estimated the forest of the Ardandy Passible for armored forces.

221
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
- As you will see, this was one of the costly assessments in all military history.

222
00:22:36,000 --> 00:23:07,000
- That was the situation on May 9, 1940. The hour of the democracy is prayed for strength to meet the coming hurricane of terror.

223
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:32,000
- Well across the Rhine....and the war against the people of the world.

224
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
- A glorious man possesses the germination. We, as your command, are for us, our greatest.

225
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
- We, the influence, the enemies, are never defeated again.

226
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
- And that you, the truth about the country, will be destroyed. The government has always been able to destroy the war against Germany.

227
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
- The war has always been over.

228
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
- The war has always been over.

229
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
- The war has always been over.

230
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
- The war has always been over.

231
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
- The war has always been over.

232
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:26,000
- The war has always been over. The war has always is over. The war is over. Deep down! Deep down! Deep down!

233
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
- Deep down!

234
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
- Deep down!

235
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
- Deep down!

236
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
- Deep down!

237
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
- Deep down!

238
00:24:36,000 --> 00:25:16,000
- Their time can come!

239
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
- Without even bothering to declare war, the German armies launched a coordinated attack

240
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,460
- across the neutral borders of Luxembourg, Belgium and Holland from the

241
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,120
- maginoline north to the sea. The action along the entire front was simultaneous

242
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,160
- so for purposes of clarity let's take up one country at a time. First let's see

243
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:56,000
- what happened in Holland.

244
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
- Maxi ground forces smashed through, the improvised and hastily erected border defenses.

245
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,500
- But the main attack was to come from the air,

246
00:26:04,500 --> 00:27:01,000
- far behind the defense lines.

247
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
- Over 10,000 troops were landed in this manner.

248
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
- Before the stunned citizens of Rotterdam even knew they were at war,

249
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
- these troops, aided by well-trained Fifth columnists,

250
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
- quickly captured the airport and outlying sections of the city.

251
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
- Mean time, Nazi armored columns were racing across the country.

252
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
- Their progress was speeded by other 5th columnists.

253
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
- They prevented the destruction of vital dynasties and bridges.

254
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
- These forces affected a meeting with the parachutists landed in Rotterdam.

255
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
- The Dutch were doomed to defeat.

256
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
- On the 4th day of the invasion, the Nazis gave the Dutch General an ultimatum. All Dutch resistance mcease or Rotterdam will be bombed flat.

257
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,000
- The Dutch General had little choice. To save the lives of innocent civilians he accepted the German Terps. But after the unconditional surrender, the Nazis bombed the city anyway.

258
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,440
- Lights have unimposed German bombers blue- low over the center of Rotterdam,

259
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
- and methodically bomb did into a heap of rubble.

260
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:27,000
- One of the most ruthless exhibitions of savagery the world has ever seen. Over 30,000 men, women and children were killed in the space of 90 minutes.

261
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
- The only six months before Hitler had said,

262
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
- "The new Reich has endeavored to continue the traditional friendship with Holland.

263
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- The Dutch will not forget."

264
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,880
- The main German attack was directed at the Albert Canal Murs River Line, the anchor of which was Fort Ebena-Mail, a modern and seemingly impregnable fortress. The Germans had secretly built a replica of the mighty

265
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,920
- fortress in Czechoslovakia and had

266
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,760
- rehearsed the attack until I knew every detail of the

267
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,000
- fort's construction, and it's every weakness.

268
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,920
- When the real attack came, it was foolproof.

269
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,560
- Parachute troops, dive bombers, plane forwards,

270
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,880
- specially trained engineer battalions,

271
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,880
- all working together as a well trained team.

272
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:46,500
- They knew exactly where to cross the river.

273
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:07,000
- You will notice that this assault engineer knows exactly where to put his high explosives charge in order to destroy the block house.

274
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,000
- Fort Ebena male withstood the Nazi attack exactly two days, and the German armies rolled on.

275
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:55,000
- Meantime, a mile and a half after the German invasion began, allied troops crossed the French Belgium border to meet the advancing Germans.

276
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
- As they raced across Belgium to take up their defense positions, they met an obstacle they hadn't counted on.

277
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:21,000
- Refugees.

278
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
- And the refugee choke droids didn't get that way by accident. The Nazis methodically bombed little towns in villages,

279
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
- otherwise devoid of any military value,

280
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
- not so much to kill as to drive the inhabitants out onto the highways.

281
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
- Then by expert machine gun, the Nazis would herd them along in terrorist-stricken flight,

282
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
- and hopelessly in pangol with fancy-aligned armies. The spirit machine gun, the Nazis would heard them along in terror-stricken flight,

283
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
- and hopelessly in pangol with a fancy-gallied armies.

284
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:25,000
- Refugees used as a weapon of war, a new law in Inhumane.

285
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
- No school today, the sign says. The children are otherwise occupied.

286
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:56,120
- says the children are otherwise occupied.

287
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,280
- No, no school today. Although only six months before, Hitler had announced, the like has put forth no claim which might in any way

288
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,960
- be regarded as a threat to Belgium.

289
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,720
- The Belgians will not forget.

290
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,280
- And what about the Allies?

291
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,600
- They were convinced that the German attack on Belgium

292
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,760
- and Holland was the main thrust, and according to plan,

293
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,160
- it swung their armies like a gate in the Belgium.

294
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,320
- But the attack on Belgium and Holland was only a faint.

295
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,900
- The main German attack was to be

296
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,480
- centered where the Allies least expected it,

297
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,280
- through the Ardenne Forest.

298
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,840
- For this decisive blow, they had secretly assembled

299
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,880
- the mightiest striking force the world had ever seen,

300
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,000
- including 45,000 armored vehicles.

301
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
- At the same time that the Nazi armies were plunging into Holland and Belgium,

302
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:52,000
- this column started to move.

303
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:07,000
- Well-trained engineer battalions went first. They were posed only by scattered-aligned patrols.

304
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
- They cleared pathways for the tends to follow.

305
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
- In three days, the Germans armored force reached the Murs River. Two days faster than the French Thor and Eight troops could get through.

306
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
- By all rules, the Germans should have paused here to bring up heavy artillery

307
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
- before attempting to force the river.

308
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
- But the Nazis had a new type of artillery.

309
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
- Now it's parmines.

310
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
- And they blasted the French positions across the Murs.

311
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
- With feverish haste, the Germans later barrage across the river

312
00:40:42,000 --> 00:41:37,200
- with anything and everything that would shoot. This tremendous concentration of firepower continued all through the night.

313
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,000
- By the following day,

314
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:52,920
- shoprooms were able to get across the river. These shot troops held the bridge in until the engineers brought up Pothons and built bridges. Then, without wasting a moment, across these bridges, the main armored force of the German

315
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,920
- military machine rolled through to Sudan, for the all-important breakthrough into a dismayed

316
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,000
- and flat-footed France. There went the old ballgame for the Allies.

317
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
- From here on it was only a matter of how long.

318
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
- Watch the math as one of our intelligence officers explains

319
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
- the details of the German breakthrough.

320
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
- We speak of the breakthrough at Sadan.

321
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
- But actually the break was along a wide front,

322
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
- extending for 50 miles from Namur in Belgium to Sedan.

323
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
- Further north the Allied armies had swung like a gate into these positions.

324
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
- The German armies had swept over Holland, broken the line of the Albert Canal,

325
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
- and for all anyone new, were preparing to smash against the Allied front with all that power.

326
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,360
- That was the situation dangerous but obscure on the evening of May 13th.

327
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:56,000
- On the 14th and 15th it became clear that the German breakthrough south of

328
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,880
- Namor was in the greatest strength and that the French 9th Army attacked while moving

329
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,560
- into position had been shattered.

330
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,000
- Without doubt this was the point of mortal danger and the French high command ordered the

331
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,120
- abandonment of these positions, although they had not yet been attacked.

332
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,360
- Those positions were abandoned solely because of the situation developing along the Murs

333
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:28,700
- near Sadam. In the meantime, the French Seventh Army had been ordered to make its historic

334
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:37,100
- forced march far to the south into the area threatened by the rapidly advancing German

335
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:47,000
- spearheads. This army was not used to attack the German flank, but rather was used as a plug to restore the broken front.

336
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,760
- Throughout the Allies had placed their faith not in offense, but in defense, and the

337
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,000
- defense was doomed to failure. Because it was confronted with an entirely new technique

338
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:07,280
- in warfare, the playing tank infantry team in action. The world was staggered by the speed with which the German armoured columns moved.

339
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,480
- What was the secret that enabled armies to move so far so rapidly?

340
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,760
- The secret lay in the organization of the striking spearhead.

341
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:23,120
- Armoured forces came first, closely followed by motorized divisions, which peeled off

342
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,440
- forming solid walls.

343
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,400
- And through the corridor, thus formed,

344
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,920
- raced the supply trucks to feed the ever-lengthening column.

345
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,720
- It was obvious that if the Allied situation was to be restored, the German column would have to be cut.

346
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,380
- On May 17th, General De Gaulle attacked the German flank

347
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,940
- and captured a few prisoners.

348
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,920
- But his like mechanized forces were like a pin

349
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,420
- breaking the side of a rhinoceros.

350
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,460
- A subsequent attack met with even less success.

351
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:09,920
- The means for a really successful counter-attack the German carder simply did not exist,

352
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:17,000
- where numbers of divisions were required, only handfuls of companies and battalions were

353
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,760
- available.

354
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:27,160
- A valiant attempt to cut the German carder was made by a group of slow-moving British tanks,

355
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,560
- just south of Arah.

356
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,280
- But lack of sustained striking power,

357
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,280
- doomed this valiant unit to destruction.

358
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,760
- On May 21st, the German spearhead

359
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,320
- reached the channel port of Abbeyville.

360
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,600
- Protecting their flank along the psalm,

361
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,320
- the Germans found out to the north and east.

362
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,240
- This was to be the perfect battle of annihilation.

363
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,840
- On May 28th, the Belgian army compressed into a small space

364
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,240
- and weary of battle lay down its arms.

365
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,640
- That left the desperate French and British defenders

366
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,240
- with their backs to the sea at the small Channel Port

367
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,120
- of Dunkirk.

368
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,520
- One of the greatest disasters in history

369
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,120
- seemed in the making.

370
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,880
- An entire British army faced annihilation.

371
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,480
- But out of the fog and the mist,

372
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,500
- robbing the channel came a strange armada. Of Navy craft, fishing boats,

373
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,000
- pleasure yards, anything that would float.

374
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,500
- The sea-going people of Britain had come to rescue their army.

375
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:51,000
- High overhead British fighter planes fought the Luke Walker to a stanzed him.

376
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
- While below, small Allied suicide units, held a German pack long enough

377
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:12,000
- with a miracle of gun-curred to take place.

378
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:22,000
- 211,500 British troops, plus 112,500 French and Belgian were rescued.

379
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
- Over 300,000 battle-tested men, grimly determined to go back again with new tools,

380
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
- new weapons with which to blast the heated Nazis out of this world.

381
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
- For three men, like rubber balls, the harder they fall,

382
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
- the higher they bounce.

383
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
- Leading the British by this time was a man who had been bouncing all his life,

384
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,200
- Winston Churchill, who had tried for years to warn the world about Germany.

385
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,340
- Mean time the situation that faced France was as nearly hopeless as a military situation

386
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,000
- can be.

387
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,440
- Two-fifths of the French army was lost.

388
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,340
- There were fewer than 50 divisions left to defend the front almost 200 miles long, running

389
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,720
- from the northern end of the Magoon or line to the sea.

390
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,200
- And behind that thin front line, there were no reserves.

391
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,320
- Despairing people of Paris sent their children south,

392
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:30,480
- praying that some miracle would keep them from harm.

393
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,120
- The hopeless men of the French army without adequate arms or equipment

394
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,000
- braced themselves for the coming blow.

395
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,960
- The first blow fell on June 5th.

396
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,760
- The French resistance was determined,

397
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:50,840
- but by June 8th, the left flank army had been shattered and a general withdrawal was ordered to the line of the man and the same.

398
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,880
- On June 9th, the German main attack came.

399
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,080
- Within two days, the German, armoured and motorized divisions roared out into the open terrain.

400
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,720
- With this breakthrough, the issue of the Battle of France was decided. And from

401
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,240
- that time on, there was official talk of anomesthes.

402
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:20,120
- Now, what about the famous Marginal Line? Let's go back and take a look. On June 14th, the Germans

403
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:26,000
- launched two attacks against the Marginal Line. In both cases, penetrations were affected.

404
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
- But we must remember that this was against fortifications

405
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
- defended by men devoid of hope.

406
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
- In the meantime, Mussolini is now thinking it's safe

407
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
- sent his division, racing across the border.

408
00:50:43,000 --> 00:51:00,000
- The hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.

409
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
- Organized resistance in France was no longer possible.

410
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
- The government faced two alternatives,

411
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
- retired to North Africa and carry on from there,

412
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
- or give up the struggle.

413
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
- France's leaders were old and tired,

414
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
- and the oldest and most tired was Marshall Paytown,

415
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
- egg-donned by men like Laval,

416
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,240
- who saw in a German victory his chance for personal power on June 16th,

417
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,000
- pay-tie asked for an armistice.

418
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,880
- The news is carried to Hitler, who received this word of a great nation's fall in a characteristic

419
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,600
- manner.

420
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,040
- Also characteristic were his terms for the armistice. It must be signed in the coach where Marshal Fosch met

421
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,000
- the defeated Germans in the last war.

422
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:19,200
- The French delegation arrives to pay the final price of French disunity and the treachery of some of its leaders.

423
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:27,000
- The final price, a price that for centuries to come, the French won't forget.

424
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
- More than three-fifths of their country was to be blacked out by a military occupation.

425
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
- The remainder was to be controlled by a French government acceptable to Hitler.

426
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,600
- Attacks of 400 million francs a day was to be imposed on the French people to support

427
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,580
- the German army of occupation.

428
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,580
- Nearly two million French prisoners of war were to be taken into Germany and kept there

429
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:04,080
- as hostages to work as slaves or rot of hunger tuberculosis or other diseases in concentration

430
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,000
- caps. tuberculosis or other diseases in concentration camps.

431
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
- Men deliberately and permanently separated from their families

432
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
- in order to decrease the French birth rate

433
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
- and thus eliminate France as a world-powered and future generation.

434
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
- French civilians, men, women and children,

435
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,200
- must slave on farmer-enf factory for the Nazi master race,

436
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,300
- or starve.

437
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,300
- There will be a class of subject alien races.

438
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,800
- We need not hesitate to call them slaves.

439
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,400
- French children were to grow up on such inadequate food

440
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,400
- that many would reach the age of 12

441
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,800
- before they grew new teeth.

442
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,180
- And for any attempts to protest against these restrictions, thousands of innocent French

443
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:59,040
- civilians would be executed.

444
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,000
- This was the price the French were to pay as they signed the armistice.

445
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,500
- And the master of the master, Race Musgot de Paris,

446
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,880
- to tour the streets of what was once the city of light.

447
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,040
- You notice no cheering crowds here to welcome in the new order.

448
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:32,080
- When the people of Paris come to the streets again, it is to hear the voice of dictators,

449
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:46,000
- telling them what they must do, how they must live, what they must say, what they must think, telling them how to be slaves,

450
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
- gone is through a public of France,

451
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
- gone is free speech in a free representative government,

452
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
- gone is liberty, equality, fraternity.

453
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
- These are the French.

454
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
- With their ears they listen.

455
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,760
- But their minds and their hearts,

456
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,600
- these are down on the Mediterranean,

457
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,440
- where the battle colors of the regiments

458
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,760
- are being taken to Africa, out of the Nazi grasp.

459
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,520
- The people weep as their glory departs,

460
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,440
- but they don't as yet know that France has hope,

461
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,720
- a rallying point.

462
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,120
- Charles de Gaulle, a soldier in the great tradition of Bosch is not surrendering. He will continue to go, a soldier in the great tradition of

463
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,920
- Bosch is not surrendering. He will continue to fight, gathering

464
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,920
- about him loyal Frenchmen from all over the world to become

465
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,360
- the free French army, the fighting French. Yes, the people

466
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,800
- weak as they watch their colors go. Not knowing the two

467
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,880
- years later, those same flags would again be unfurled in North Africa.

468
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,960
- Alongside the stars and stripes.

469
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,760
- Alongside the Union J.

470
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,040
- Once more their leaders general to Gaul and the famous General Zero stand united in the

471
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,680
- common cause with the leaders of their allies.

472
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,800
- Once more the red white and blue of France

473
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:14,000
- is raised on high. For out of the ashes of the defeat and the humiliation of France,

474
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:50,000
- her soul has been born again.
