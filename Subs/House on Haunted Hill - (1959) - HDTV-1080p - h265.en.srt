1
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,293
The ghosts are moving tonight.
Restless, hungry.

2
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,834
May I introduce myself?
I am Watson Pritchard.

3
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,729
In just a minute I'll show you
the only really haunted house...

4
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,097
in the world.

5
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:07,151
Since it was built a
century ago, seven people,

6
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,976
including my brother,
have been murdered in it.

7
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:14,395
Since then, I have owned the house.

8
00:01:15,036 --> 00:01:16,955
I've only spent one night there,

9
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:18,999
and when they found
me in the morning... I

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,494
I was almost dead.

11
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:32,389
I am Frederick Loren.

12
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,392
And I've rented the house
on haunted hill tonight...

13
00:01:35,393 --> 00:01:37,670
so that my wife can give a party.

14
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,594
A haunted house party.

15
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,301
She's so amusing.

16
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:47,280
There'll be food and
drink and ghosts,

17
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,810
and perhaps even a few murders.

18
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,936
You're all invited.

19
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,455
If any of you will spend
the next 12 hours

20
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:57,701
in this house, I will give you
each 10 thousand dollars.

21
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:01,588
Or your next-of-kin in
case you don't survive.

22
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:04,743
Ah, but here come other guests.

23
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:09,638
It was my wife's idea...

24
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,917
to have our guests
come in funeral cars.

25
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:15,520
She's so amusing.

26
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:17,731
Her sense of humor is,
shall we say...

27
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,025
original.

28
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:22,403
I dreamed of the hearse,
it's empty now, but

29
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:25,490
after a night in the
house of haunted hill.

30
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:27,894
Who knows?

31
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,863
This is Lance Schroeder,
a test pilot.

32
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:33,123
So no doubt a brave man.

33
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:36,461
But don't you think you can be
much braver if you're paid for it?

34
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:40,507
And I happen to know that Lance
needs the 10.000 I'll give him.

35
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,886
If he is brave enough
to stay all night.

36
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,429
This is Ruth Bridgers.

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,015
You've no doubt read her
column in the newspapers.

38
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,393
She says her reason for
coming to the party is

39
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:53,013
to write a feature article on ghosts.

40
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:58,096
She's also desperate
for money. Gambles.

41
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:01,030
You've already met Watson Pritchard.

42
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,699
A man living in mortal
fear of a house

43
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,578
and yet he is risking his life
to spend another night here.

44
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,330
I wonder why.

45
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,404
He says it's for money.

46
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:15,505
This is Dr. David Trent.
A psychiatrist.

47
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:18,216
He claims that my ghosts
will help his work...

48
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,914
on hysteria.

49
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,848
But don't you see a little
touch of greed there?

50
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,502
Around the mouth and eyes?

51
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,896
This is Nora Manning.

52
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:32,774
I picked her from the thousands
of people who work for me...

53
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,735
because she needed the 10
thousand more than most.

54
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:40,187
Supports her whole family.
Isn't she pretty?

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,457
The party is starting now
and you have until midnight,

56
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,210
to find the House on Haunted Hill.

57
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,219
Well, where is everybody?

58
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,968
It isn't a very warm welcome, is it?

59
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:41,100
Only the ghosts in this
house are glad we're here.

60
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:45,233
Are we all strangers to each other?

61
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:47,452
Don't you two know each other?

62
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:49,497
I'm afraid I don't
even know your name.

63
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,992
- I am Nora Manning.
- Lance Schroeder.

64
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:54,877
Is Frederick Loren a friend of yours?

65
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:57,047
I've heard of him,
but I've never met him.

66
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,633
I work in one of his companies,
but I've have never seen him.

67
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:02,677
I've never met the man either,
just a phone call.

68
00:07:02,678 --> 00:07:05,848
- Do you know him?
- No.

69
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:08,393
Well then, you're the
only one of us who does.

70
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,727
I don't know him.

71
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,646
All the details about
renting the house...

72
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:12,689
were done by mail.

73
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,942
- He's quite wealthy, isn't he?
- Millions.

74
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,444
And five wives, I believe.

75
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,571
Four, I think so far.

76
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,325
A fifty thousand dollar
party for only five people

77
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,820
is a little steepy even
for a millionaire.

78
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,834
Well, if I were going
to haunt anybody

79
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:32,704
this would most certainly
be the house I'd do it, eh?

80
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,957
Who closed the door?

81
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,052
This thing is made of solid steel.

82
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,508
Annabelle?

83
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:24,812
Our guest are here and
fortunately still alive.

84
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:26,886
Is your face on yet?

85
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:33,405
Dust and dirt everywhere.
The water barely trickles.

86
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:36,700
- Couldn't you have the place cleaned?
- Atmosphere, darling.

87
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,704
You know how ghosts are,
they never tidy up.

88
00:08:39,705 --> 00:08:43,791
Well, that's a very fetching outfit,
but hardly suitable for a party.

89
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,711
I'm not going to the party.

90
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,672
Mm, "You Spend The Night Ghost
Party" was your idea, remember?

91
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:52,343
Since it's going to cost me $50,000
dollars, I want you to have fun.

92
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:56,515
The party was my idea until
you invited all the guests.

93
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,884
Why all these strangers?
Why none of our friends?

94
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:02,271
Friends? Do we have any friends?

95
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:05,050
No. Your jealousy took care of that.

96
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,944
I had a reason for
inviting each guest.

97
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:10,197
I wanted kind of a cross section,

98
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:13,442
from psychiatrist to typist.

99
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:16,119
And from drunk to jet pilot.

100
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,525
They share one thing.
They all need money.

101
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,611
Now let's see if they're
brave enough to earn it.

102
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,673
And you call this a party?

103
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:27,326
Could be.

104
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,057
Why do you always do that?
It spoils the champagne.

105
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:37,428
- It might explode.
- Never does.

106
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,982
Would you guarantee that?

107
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:44,318
- That isn't funny, Frederick.
- Would make a good headline.

108
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:47,974
Playboy kills wife
with champagne cork.

109
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,983
- Would you join me?
- No, thank you.

110
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:56,124
Just a sip might improve your humor.

111
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,501
My humor is fine, thanks.

112
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:01,121
And I haven't poisoned it.

113
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,159
It's always good to know that.

114
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:12,172
Have some,
you'll enjoy the party more.

115
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:14,386
Go on.

116
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:24,488
Your trust is so touching.

117
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,733
And I'm not going to the party.

118
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:29,411
Of all my wives,
you are the least agreeable.

119
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:31,029
But still alive.

120
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:36,032
Would you go away for a
million dollars in tax-free?

121
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,338
You want it all, don't you?

122
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,412
I deserve it all.

123
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,260
Your jealousy isn't tax free.

124
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,709
And your possessiveness is maddening.

125
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,505
If ever a man had
grounds for divorce.

126
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:53,271
- But can't prove them.
- The time will come.

127
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:56,802
- You'll slip up one of these days.
- You think so?

128
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,141
If I live long enough.

129
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,102
You remember the fun we
had when you poisoned me?

130
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,536
Something you ate, the doctor said.

131
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:09,781
Yes, arsenic on the rocks.

132
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,585
Annabelle...

133
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:15,838
You'd do it again if you thought you
could get away with it, wouldn't you?

134
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,617
Darling, what makes you think that?

135
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,287
Something about you.

136
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,183
I hear that hanging is
very uncomfortable,

137
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,963
in case you get any more ideas.

138
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,857
Don't let the ghosts and the
ghouls disturb you, darling.

139
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,904
Darling, the only ghoul
in the house is you.

140
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,908
And don't sit up all night,
thinking of ways to get rid of me.

141
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,061
It makes wrinkles.

142
00:11:57,094 --> 00:12:00,055
This is what she used on
my brother and her sister.

143
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,890
Hacked them to pieces.

144
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:04,476
We found parts of their
bodies all over the house.

145
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,721
In places you wouldn't think.

146
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,649
The funny thing is the heads
have never been found.

147
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,569
The hands and feet,
and things like that...

148
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,488
but no heads.

149
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:17,158
The wife, probably in a rage
threatened her husband with a knife,

150
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,119
and then, carried away by
hysteria took a swing at him,

151
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,162
and simply went on from there.

152
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:25,208
Well, she certainly went on. How many
people did she kill, Mr. Pritchard?

153
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,044
Only two. Her husband and her sister.

154
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,546
No one else was here.

155
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:32,667
So there are two loose heads just
floating around in here somewhere?

156
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,719
You can hear them at night.

157
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,250
They whisper to each
other and then cry.

158
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:40,809
Since our host isn't here,

159
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,103
would anyone care to mix me a drink?

160
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,928
Certainly, what will you have?

161
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,142
Good evening.

162
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:55,367
I'm your host, Frederick Loren.

163
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:57,745
Since we're all strangers
to each other,

164
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,497
let's get acquainted
with a drink, shall we?

165
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,116
Mr. Loren.

166
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,419
I advise you to call
this party off now.

167
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,214
The ghosts are already
moving and that's a bad sign.

168
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:10,218
Let me apologize for my wife.
She will join us later.

169
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,594
- What do we have?
- Scotch with ice.

170
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:13,872
- Doctor?
- I'll have the same.

171
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:17,059
Now before the party begins,

172
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,311
let's go over the details.

173
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:21,647
The caretakers will
leave at midnight,

174
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:25,599
locking us in here until they
come back in the morning.

175
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:28,768
Once the door is locked,
there is no way out.

176
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:32,451
The windows have bars that
a jail would be proud of.

177
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:36,288
And the only door to the
outside locks like a vault.

178
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:37,998
There is no electricity,

179
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:39,501
no phone,

180
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:41,920
no one within miles,

181
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,744
so, no way to call for help.

182
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,077
Like a coffin.

183
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,598
So, if any of you decide
not to stay for the party

184
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,060
you must let me know before midnight.

185
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:59,356
Of course if you leave, I shan't
be able to pay you anything.

186
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:03,934
I'm interest in your
reason for this... party.

187
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,940
Besides some pleasant company.

188
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:09,701
Ghosts, doctor.

189
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:12,538
I think everyone wonders
what they would do...

190
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,612
if they saw a ghost.

191
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:19,963
And now my wife is giving us
all the opportunity to find out.

192
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:22,549
Amusing. Ghosts, etc...

193
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,885
being only creations of hysteria...

194
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:27,415
your party should be a success.

195
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:30,474
So Pritchard here promises
us genuine ghosts.

196
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,218
Seven now,

197
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,135
maybe more before morning.

198
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:37,383
That's cheerful.

199
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:41,230
4 men have been murdered this house.

200
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:42,780
And 3 women.

201
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,158
You planned your party
very well, Mr. Loren.

202
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,108
4 of us are men, 3 are women,

203
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,523
there's a ghost for everybody.

204
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,417
So Pritchard, why don't you take
us on a tour through the house...

205
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:56,071
and let's see what happens, uh.

206
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:07,087
See that stain?

207
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:09,173
Blood.

208
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:12,757
A young girl was killed here.

209
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:15,984
And whatever got her wasn't human.
Don't stand there!

210
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:17,853
What do you mean? Where?

211
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,210
It's too late. They've marked you.

212
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,963
Ridiculous. The roof probably leaks.

213
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:37,050
Oh, that must be what it is.
Who would want to haunt me?

214
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:39,552
I would say any
self-respecting male ghost.

215
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,388
I hope it doesn't come back.

216
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,724
Oh Mr. Pritchard,
you are the life of the party.

217
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:45,518
Oh, he hasn't even started yet.

218
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,438
Wasn't there a man who threw his
wife into a wine vat or something?

219
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,816
That was in the cellar.

220
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,187
There's been a murder almost
every place in this house.

221
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:12,790
All this belonged to a Mr. Norton,

222
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,795
who didn't die here.
He was electrocuted later.

223
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:23,845
Mr. Norton did a good deal
of experimenting with wines.

224
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:27,348
But his wife didn't
think it was any good.

225
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:31,820
So he filled a vat with
acid and threw her in.

226
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:34,474
She was supposed to stay down,

227
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,482
but the bones came up.

228
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,455
It's a funny thing,

229
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:44,076
but none of the murders
here were just ordinary.

230
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:47,743
Just shooting or stabbing...

231
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,091
They've all been sort of wild...

232
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:55,589
- violent and different.
- Look out!

233
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,683
Thank God, she didn't fall in.

234
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,463
You mean there's still acid in there?

235
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:27,996
Destroys everything
with hair and flesh.

236
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,630
Just leaves the bones.

237
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:46,475
My, it's dry and dusty down here.

238
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:52,938
Because there is a cure
for that, that stinks, come on.

239
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:08,084
How did you get
invited to this party?

240
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:14,545
No. Let them go on.
I mean, what did he tell you?

241
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:20,860
Mr. Loren said everybody
would get 10 thousand dollars.

242
00:18:20,861 --> 00:18:23,070
But he didn't say anything
about being locked in?

243
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:24,347
No.

244
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:27,033
He just made a deal
with me on the phone.

245
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,357
But nothing about having to stay.

246
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,247
Aren't you going to stay?

247
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:35,903
If I don't, I lose
10 thousand dollars.

248
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:38,826
I'm going to stay, too.

249
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:42,786
- 10 thousand dollars.
- Yes.

250
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:45,746
Do you believe in ghosts?

251
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:48,041
I don't know.

252
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:51,561
Well, I believe in what that doc
says you can spook yourself.

253
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:55,190
Not a complaint, seeing things
that are not really there.

254
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:56,935
Or were they?

255
00:18:58,236 --> 00:19:00,321
What do you do with your 10 thousand?

256
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,198
If we get it.

257
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,657
What do you mean "if we get it"?

258
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,827
Won't he pay us if we stay?

259
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,955
Oh I'm sure he will.
Ten thousand is no more to him than

260
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,482
a nickle is for us.

261
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,336
We were in a automobile accident.

262
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:16,957
Now I am the only one in the
family who can make any money.

263
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,623
Well, I have never
seen so many doors.

264
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:28,219
Closet.

265
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,683
Bottles.

266
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:59,421
Does it go any where?

267
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:02,796
Lance!

268
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:05,090
Lance!

269
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,252
Help me! Please!

270
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:05,170
Lance is gone!

271
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,254
And there's a ghost!

272
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:08,954
- See what I mean?
- Please come on!

273
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,712
Did you say Lance is gone?
Gone where?

274
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,221
We'll have to break it down!
It's locked!

275
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,223
Locked?

276
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,368
Are you all right?

277
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:42,075
Nothing that money won't cure.

278
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:45,290
I must... have bumped my head.

279
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:48,457
The only way you could
bump your head in here,

280
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,956
is to run head on into the wall.

281
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:54,218
You didn't do that, did you?

282
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:57,884
Let's get a bandage on that.

283
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:09,117
I wonder why they didn't kill him?

284
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,566
Who?

285
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:14,649
He didn't bump his head,
they hit him.

286
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,658
They?

287
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:39,901
Nora, when you came in,
you said something about a ghost?

288
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:42,989
- There was something.
- What did it look like?

289
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,660
Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.

290
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:50,372
Weren't you a little
frightened at the time?

291
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,945
Oh, yes.

292
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:56,045
That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.

293
00:22:56,046 --> 00:22:58,923
Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?

294
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:00,826
Was that hysteria too?

295
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:06,307
You better get that
checked in a day or two.

296
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,800
Thanks, doc.

297
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:17,477
Wait for me in the hall.

298
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,619
The ghosts are
coming closer, Mr. Loren.

299
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,915
You really believe in your
pet ghosts, don't you Pritchard?

300
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,785
Before the night's over,
you will too.

301
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:33,629
- Would you like a drink, Lance?
- No, thanks.

302
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,079
I'd like one. Scotsman.

303
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:46,477
Mr. Loren, are you really going to
pay anyone who stays all night?

304
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:49,104
Certainly, 10 thousand dollars.

305
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:52,134
Will there be much
red tape, or delay?

306
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:55,638
- You're in a hurry, dear?
- Frankly, yes.

307
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,852
Or frantically.

308
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,858
Here you are, my dear.

309
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:27,007
Someone or something was in
here when I came in, but where?

310
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:30,894
And if the door was locked,
how did it get out?

311
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,613
What you saw might
have been a ghost, Nora.

312
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:35,699
But what was in here
with me, was no ghost.

313
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,570
I don't know, I was so scared.

314
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:52,260
That sound different to you?

315
00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:53,412
Yes.

316
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:08,934
Three, six, nine, twelve.

317
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,641
12 feet.

318
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,568
Three, six.

319
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:23,462
Now I'm going to knock
on the other wall.

320
00:25:23,463 --> 00:25:25,456
When you hear me,
you knock on this wall.

321
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:35,425
Tap lower down!

322
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:58,118
Oh, Lance! I saw it again!

323
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:11,087
- Where did it come from?
- From in here.

324
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:19,942
But if it ran out of here,
I'd have seen it.

325
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:23,612
Lance, it doesn't run,
it just floats.

326
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:26,767
Yeah, but, why didn't I see it?

327
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:29,111
You don't believe me!

328
00:26:29,662 --> 00:26:31,484
How can I?

329
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,213
I'm Annabelle Loren.

330
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:58,519
You must be Miss Manning.

331
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:02,281
I realize this is a very unusual
and a very, very dull party.

332
00:27:02,282 --> 00:27:04,777
Wouldn't you like to freshen up?

333
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:17,457
This is your room.

334
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:20,252
Depressing, isn't it?

335
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,888
I doubt if I'll spend much time here.

336
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:28,262
It's going to rain. The perfect
atmosphere for my husband's party.

337
00:27:30,689 --> 00:27:32,440
Why did you come here?

338
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,402
He said he'd give me
10 thousand dollars.

339
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,489
- Why did he pick you?
- I don't know.

340
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,019
My supervisor just came
and said I've been invited.

341
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,707
How long have you known my husband?

342
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,667
I just met him tonight.

343
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,241
So...?

344
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,324
Why you?

345
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:01,556
What were you doing,
wandering around by yourself?

346
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:04,351
Well, I was in the cellar with Lance.

347
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:06,346
Mr. Schroeder.

348
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:08,840
I just left, that's all.

349
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:11,893
Don't do it again.

350
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:15,144
Don't go anywhere in
this house by yourself.

351
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:19,368
Go on, fix you face and I'll come
by for you in a few minutes.

352
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,452
But I...

353
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,356
You're in danger.

354
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:23,945
We all are.

355
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,068
But who?

356
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:29,539
I hope for your sake,
you'll never find out.

357
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:46,357
I am Annabelle Loren.
Are you looking for something?

358
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,608
Not exactly.

359
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:50,403
- Are you the doctor?
- No, I am Lance Schroeder.

360
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:55,356
- The pilot. You've hurt yourself?
- Oh, it's just a bump on the head.

361
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:59,944
- Which is my room?
- I believe this is it.

362
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:02,776
Thank you, Mrs. Loren.

363
00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:05,696
Annabelle, Lance.

364
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:18,310
You were with the
young girl in the cellar.

365
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,770
- Why was she so upset?
- Was she?

366
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:24,025
And you don't look like the type
to go around bumping your head.

367
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,027
What did it really happened, Lance?

368
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:30,323
Well, Nora thought she saw a ghost,
but I didn't see anything.

369
00:29:30,324 --> 00:29:31,783
She was just frightened then?

370
00:29:31,784 --> 00:29:34,812
And mad at me I think.
I kidded her about it.

371
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:38,666
I wouldn't joke about anything
else that happens here tonight.

372
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,445
Now don't tell me that
you're taking all this seriously.

373
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:44,255
Aren't you?

374
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:47,331
Well, I'd like to
find out what hit me.

375
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,957
Lance...

376
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:54,423
If I need help, may I count on you?

377
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:57,425
Yeah, sure, I guess so.

378
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:00,649
Look, what's going on here anyway?

379
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,735
I mean what is with
this party business?

380
00:30:02,736 --> 00:30:04,946
This is no party.
He is planning something.

381
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:08,317
- Your husband?
- I don't think he really was.

382
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:10,994
Must be pretty big if he is
going to lay out 50 thousand.

383
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:13,372
Money doesn't mean anything.

384
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:17,404
He has a reason for getting us all
up here to this dreadful old house.

385
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,704
Well what for?
He doesn't even knows us.

386
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:22,537
Maybe that's exactly why you're here?

387
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,344
Well, what can he get away with?

388
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:28,840
Oh, he thinks his big money like
his can getaway with anything.

389
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:31,842
You know of course
that I'm his fourth wife.

390
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:34,312
The first simply disappeared.

391
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:36,465
The other two died.

392
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,263
Lance,

393
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,770
I don't want to join them.

394
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:43,698
You mean he...

395
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:47,194
All his doctors said they
died of heart attacks.

396
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:52,833
- Two girls in their twenties.
- Well, what can he do?

397
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,545
My husband is sometimes
insane with jealousy.

398
00:30:55,546 --> 00:31:00,216
Nothing matters to him anymore.
Please be careful.

399
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:01,869
Would he hurt you?

400
00:31:03,346 --> 00:31:05,794
He would kill me if he could.

401
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,666
Annabelle,
you're missing all the fun.

402
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,878
Nora Manning was almost
killed by a falling chandelier.

403
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:34,589
The pilot bashed his head in.

404
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,049
Is he badly hurt?

405
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,329
The saturnine psychiatrist
bandaged him up.

406
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:41,387
Don't you want to go and console him?

407
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:44,918
As you do with most
men in your fashion.

408
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:47,811
You are so clever, Frederick.

409
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:50,815
Since I lie awake at nights,
wondering why I married you.

410
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:52,776
It was rather a mistake.

411
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,944
You didn't marry me, dear.
I married you.

412
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:57,474
Unpleasant, but no mistake.

413
00:31:58,158 --> 00:31:59,241
Hurry up.

414
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:03,192
Frederick, for last time,
I'm not going to your party.

415
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,034
And for last time,
it's not my party, but yours.

416
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,703
And you are going.

417
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:13,633
- I am not.
- You ready dear?

418
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:17,303
- No.
- Are you ready dear?

419
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:19,347
Yes, damn you.

420
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:22,017
Would you adore me
as much if I was poor?

421
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:26,139
No, thought you wanted
to be as a lovely widow.

422
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:30,393
It's almost time to
lock up the house.

423
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:33,347
Then your party will really begin.

424
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,814
I wonder how it will end.

425
00:32:55,514 --> 00:33:00,716
- It's close to midnight, Lance.
- Okay, I'll be down in a minute.

426
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,813
- Who is it?
- Your host, my dear.

427
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,199
It's almost midnight, Nora.

428
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,161
We're all going to get together
down in the living room.

429
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:18,441
Alright Mr. Loren,
I'll be right down.

430
00:34:16,438 --> 00:34:17,564
Come with us.

431
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,967
Come with us, before he kills you.

432
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:35,326
Where is Nora? Miss Manning?

433
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:42,676
I don't want to stay here!

434
00:34:42,677 --> 00:34:44,795
Nora, what happened?

435
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:57,901
That's Jonas Slydes and his wife.

436
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:00,570
They have been caretakers
here for years.

437
00:35:00,571 --> 00:35:02,656
She's blind, you know?

438
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:05,060
I'm not going to stay here!

439
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:11,500
Well doctor, it looks like we have a
real case of hysteria on our hands.

440
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:15,951
Oh, I thinks she's just a
little upset, not hysterical.

441
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:23,334
Good evening.

442
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,799
Hello, my dear.

443
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:32,481
This is my wife.
These are our guests.

444
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:33,942
Ruth Bridgers.

445
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:35,444
Dr. Trent.

446
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:37,321
You know Watson Pritchard, of course.

447
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:39,406
Nora Manning and...

448
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:42,311
This is Lance Schroeder.

449
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,793
Get me out of here!

450
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:51,378
Now what about the 10 thousand?

451
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:53,130
I don't care. He wants to kill me.

452
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,382
Who wants to kill you?

453
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:57,127
Mr. Loren.

454
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,888
May I have your attention, please.

455
00:35:59,889 --> 00:36:02,640
I think you all remember
the bargain we made

456
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:06,479
about staying all night.
10 thousand dollars apiece.

457
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,939
If any of you don't survive,

458
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,652
50 thousand dollars will be
divided amongst the rest of you.

459
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,179
If I should die...

460
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:21,037
You will be paid by my estate.

461
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:23,873
When the door is locked from
the outside by the caretakers,

462
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:26,626
we'll all be forced to to stay
in this house until morning.

463
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:28,587
If any of you decide not to stay...

464
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,464
you must leave with
the caretakers now.

465
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:33,493
You won't have a chance
to change your minds later

466
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:36,763
because there'll be
no way to get out.

467
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:39,587
- I don't want to stay!
- Wait.

468
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,627
It isn't midnight yet.
Who told them they could leave?

469
00:37:04,628 --> 00:37:06,129
They never leave before midnight.

470
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,078
Well, they've gone now.

471
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,010
I was going to ask you whether
you wanted to stay or not...

472
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:15,390
but it seems that the caretakers
have made the decision for you.

473
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:17,684
We're all locked in now.

474
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:19,144
But I don't want to stay.

475
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:22,231
I sorry my dear,
but it's too late now.

476
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:25,734
Darling, haven't you had
enough of this silly game?

477
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:29,196
Get some cars up here for these
people and let them go home.

478
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:31,976
But pay them first.

479
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:36,488
This is your party, remember?

480
00:37:37,498 --> 00:37:41,752
In spite of my wife's faith in
my ability to do the impossible,

481
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:46,133
we will all have to stay in this house
until eight o'clock in the morning.

482
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:49,761
But we have some
party favors for you...

483
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:52,540
in these little coffins.

484
00:37:55,603 --> 00:38:00,858
This is my wife's idea and I must
say I think it's rather dangerous.

485
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:03,819
I suppose you all know how
to use one of this things

486
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,237
but in case you don't...

487
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:08,909
you just press down on this
lever with your thumb and then

488
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,983
pull the trigger.

489
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:16,237
You see, they're loaded.

490
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:21,323
These are no good against
the dead, only the living.

491
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,789
Doctor.

492
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,959
Lance.

493
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,252
Nora.

494
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:36,215
Go ahead, take it.

495
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,642
Miss Bridgers.

496
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,329
- And here is yours, dear.
- I don't need it.

497
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,956
It was your idea.

498
00:38:50,957 --> 00:38:54,657
Who knows, you may want to use
it on me before this night is over.

499
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,508
Throw these guns away,
they won't do you any good.

500
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,510
I agree with Pritchard on that point

501
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:04,263
although not for the same reason.

502
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:06,086
Dr. Trent...

503
00:39:08,101 --> 00:39:12,052
don't you approve of
our little party favors?

504
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:15,316
Suppose Nora had had
a gun when she mistook

505
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:16,985
the blind woman for a ghost.

506
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:21,312
I don't think anyone else is going
to walk around in total darkness.

507
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:23,993
Oh, I'm sure we're not going
to go running round the house

508
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,079
shooting each other, aren't you?

509
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,280
Who knows? Fear makes
people do amazing things.

510
00:39:34,798 --> 00:39:38,301
Mr. Pritchard,
you said your sister-in-law

511
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:41,080
killed a man and woman
here and cut them up.

512
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,140
You said they found hands and feet,

513
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:45,350
but they never found any heads.

514
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,936
Would you like to see
one of those heads?

515
00:39:47,937 --> 00:39:50,136
Would you all like to
see one of those heads?

516
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:53,135
Okay, just follow me!

517
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:04,986
Darling, I really don't need this.

518
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,059
Just go look in my suitcase.

519
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,178
Just go, look.

520
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:39,828
But it was in there! A woman's head!

521
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:42,778
Nora, I think you're a little upset.

522
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:44,501
Would you care for a sedative?

523
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:46,711
Get out! Get out all of you!

524
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:49,255
All of you get out of
here and leave me alone!

525
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:51,705
Just get out of here!

526
00:40:55,597 --> 00:40:58,295
You think it's alright to
leave her by herself, doctor?

527
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:00,310
I wished she'd taken the sedative.

528
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:02,479
Well, what do you suppose
she thought she saw?

529
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,980
They're closing in on her.

530
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,857
Look Doc, I think somebody
ought to stay with her.

531
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:07,652
There could be a million
people around her

532
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:10,272
but if they wanted her,
they'd get her.

533
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:13,741
What if he's right?

534
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:15,744
He's too drunk to know
what he's talking about.

535
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:19,524
I wonder. I'll join you in a minute.

536
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:28,466
Do you think it would do any good
if you went in and talk to her?

537
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:31,929
Would you think there really
was a head in her suitcase?

538
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,389
I don't know.

539
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,975
Something like that would
put me right over the edge.

540
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:40,480
Well, could you sort of stay up here,
I mean, in case she needs help?

541
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:45,228
All right. I'll be in my room.
Just call if you need.

542
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,809
Thanks.

543
00:41:57,667 --> 00:42:00,586
Are you sure there are only
seven people in this house?

544
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:03,006
Positive, except for the ghosts.

545
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:07,287
I don't believe in ghosts
nor in frightening women.

546
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:09,972
In Nora's case, it's gone far enough.

547
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:11,599
Perhaps too far.

548
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,934
What do you suggest
we do about it, doctor?

549
00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:16,555
Don't frighten her any more!

550
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:41,996
Nora?

551
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,996
Nora?

552
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:56,013
Nora?

553
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,667
Nora!

554
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:22,670
Nora!

555
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:35,569
What do you know about this?

556
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:39,691
They've taken her. In a little
while she'll be one of them.

557
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:43,061
Where is Nora?

558
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,704
Where is she?

559
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,414
It's too late.

560
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,082
You'll never find her again.

561
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,502
Pritchard, if you know where
she is, you'd better tell me now!

562
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,296
She's gone! She's gone with them!

563
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,916
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

564
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:09,390
Nora.

565
00:44:18,034 --> 00:44:19,606
Take it down!

566
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:57,652
Nora?

567
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,402
She is dead, Mr. Loren.

568
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:06,456
Your wife hanged herself.

569
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:08,742
Suicide.

570
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:39,291
- Lance!
- Nora!

571
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:41,002
Lance, hide, please hide.

572
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:43,155
- What's the matter?
- Hide!

573
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:54,084
He tried to kill me.

574
00:45:54,476 --> 00:45:58,221
He grabbed me and choked
me and put me in that room.

575
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:00,816
And then he went away and left me.

576
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:01,843
Who?

577
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,528
He thought I was dead.

578
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:05,725
Who?

579
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:08,851
Mr. Loren.

580
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:11,566
Are you sure about this?

581
00:46:12,246 --> 00:46:16,777
I don't know. It... it was dark,
but it must have been him.

582
00:46:17,169 --> 00:46:19,822
Has anybody seen you
since he left you?

583
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:24,835
I heard some people in that room,
but I went by and nobody saw me.

584
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:28,539
Mrs. Loren is dead.

585
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,418
But how?

586
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,148
Loren said she committed suicide.

587
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:39,276
But I think somebody killed her.

588
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:40,678
Him?

589
00:47:18,071 --> 00:47:20,614
I'm sure you've come to the
same conclusion I have.

590
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:22,366
Yeah. I think so.

591
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,519
Let's all have a meeting
and discuss what to do.

592
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:28,695
- The living room?
- Okay. In a minute.

593
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,432
I've got to go downstairs.

594
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:47,727
Now you lock yourself in here and
don't let anybody know you're here.

595
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,730
If he thinks you're dead
he won't come here.

596
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:52,384
And I'll get back as soon as I can.

597
00:47:52,526 --> 00:47:54,553
You'll be alright.

598
00:47:57,866 --> 00:47:59,867
And if you have to...

599
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:01,736
you use it.

600
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,622
So beautiful.

601
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,293
So greedy.

602
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:01,925
So cold.

603
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,946
- What are you doing in here?
- Wait, don't we...

604
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,020
What do you mean, coming in here?

605
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,535
- I don't want them to take her away.
- You're drunk.

606
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,246
- They will if you don't watch her.
- You're drunk!

607
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,289
Alright I'll put it, Pritchard!
Why did you come into this room?

608
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,659
- I'm the only one who understands.
- Understands what?

609
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:26,798
Your wife isn't there anymore,
she's already joined them.

610
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:29,593
Now Pritchard, I've had
enough of your spook talk.

611
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:33,089
Get out you sot, and don't come
back into this room again!

612
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,330
Where is what's her name...?

613
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:10,923
Nora?

614
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,727
I didn't disturb her since I
don't think this concerns her.

615
00:50:14,728 --> 00:50:16,301
Now you're right.

616
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:22,277
Mr. Loren, isn't there some way
we can get out of this house now?

617
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:24,905
No. None at all.

618
00:50:24,906 --> 00:50:26,657
We could try breaking out.

619
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:29,732
The only door to the
outside is made of steel.

620
00:50:30,245 --> 00:50:33,399
The bars at the windows
are set in solid stone.

621
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:36,410
We gotta stay.

622
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:40,282
I'm not afraid of
your ghosts, Pritchard.

623
00:50:42,384 --> 00:50:44,377
But I am afraid.

624
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:47,514
When we came here a few hours ago,

625
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:50,768
the only thing we had in common was
the 10 thousand dollars we'd get.

626
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:53,467
Now however we share something else.

627
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:55,599
The death of Mrs. Loren.

628
00:50:57,234 --> 00:51:02,391
So far tonight, one of us was
almost killed by a falling chandelier.

629
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:05,564
One of us was mysteriously slugged.

630
00:51:06,036 --> 00:51:09,235
One of us is being driven to
the brink of absolute hysteria.

631
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:12,363
And one of us is dead.

632
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:16,998
Were these accidents? Suicide?

633
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,801
And we must stay here
for six more hours?

634
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:21,169
6 hours?

635
00:51:22,304 --> 00:51:24,126
Six of us.

636
00:51:25,475 --> 00:51:28,424
- Time enough.
- Who will be next?

637
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:30,550
How will it happen?

638
00:51:31,481 --> 00:51:34,135
Let me ask you a question doctor.

639
00:51:34,276 --> 00:51:36,986
You were the first one
to see my wife dead.

640
00:51:36,987 --> 00:51:40,240
Did you also see anything that
she could have climbed up on

641
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:42,895
- and then jumped?
- No.

642
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,238
Did any of you?

643
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,114
There was nothing.

644
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:52,462
How then did she get up there?

645
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:55,799
- So high,
- Exactly, Mr. Loren, how?

646
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,844
She couldn't have
pulled herself up there.

647
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:00,122
She couldn't have
dropped from the ceiling.

648
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:02,917
Do you think your
wife killed herself?

649
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:04,760
No.

650
00:52:05,186 --> 00:52:07,008
She was murdered.

651
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,382
By one of you.

652
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:16,181
Or you, Mr. Loren.

653
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:19,952
To deliberately kill someone
you must have a reason.

654
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:22,246
We were all strangers to your wife.

655
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:25,241
Only you had a motive for murder.

656
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:29,572
What husband hasn't at some
time wanted to kill his wife?

657
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:32,132
What husband hasn't had
a thousand opportunities

658
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:35,094
to do it in such a way so
that he'd never be suspected.

659
00:52:35,095 --> 00:52:37,221
I'm not such a fool
as to hang my wife

660
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:38,931
from a ceiling by a rope.

661
00:52:38,932 --> 00:52:40,433
The fact remains that you

662
00:52:40,434 --> 00:52:43,187
or one of us murdered Mrs. Loren.

663
00:52:43,188 --> 00:52:46,815
- And that's the matter for the police.
- So, how do we get the police?

664
00:52:46,816 --> 00:52:49,560
That's my point.
We can't until morning.

665
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:51,488
What began as a silly party

666
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:54,824
given by an eccentric,
has now involved us all in murder.

667
00:52:54,825 --> 00:52:56,576
For once Pritchard may be right.

668
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:59,788
If another murder is in the
works, let's stop it now.

669
00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:02,500
- Another murder?
- Why not?

670
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:05,279
Maybe one of us saw much.

671
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:11,092
Why should even a millionaire want to
give each of us 10 thousand dollars

672
00:53:11,093 --> 00:53:13,638
to spend one night in
a gloomy old house?

673
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:15,723
To see some ghosts and have a party?

674
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:18,684
- No.
- Have you finished trying me, doctor?

675
00:53:18,685 --> 00:53:20,770
And is the verdict guilty of murder?

676
00:53:20,771 --> 00:53:22,856
No, this isn't getting us anywhere.

677
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:25,192
Somebody killed
Mrs. Loren, we know that.

678
00:53:25,193 --> 00:53:27,903
One of us is guilty and the
rest of us are innocent. Okay.

679
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,073
Now what we have to do
for the next six hours

680
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:32,951
is to protect ourselves...
from each other.

681
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:35,954
- Do you really think...?
- I don't think anything.

682
00:53:35,955 --> 00:53:37,998
I just know that I'm
going to my room.

683
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:40,527
And if anybody comes in,
I'll shoot him...

684
00:53:40,877 --> 00:53:42,044
or her.

685
00:53:42,045 --> 00:53:43,546
And if we all stay in our rooms...

686
00:53:43,547 --> 00:53:44,548
we'll be safe.

687
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:47,467
Because the innocent will have
no reason to leave his room,

688
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:50,387
and the guilty will admit
his guilt if he or she does.

689
00:53:50,388 --> 00:53:54,183
- And we all have guns.
- Then we are all agreed?

690
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:57,337
Oh I wish this night were over.

691
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:02,260
Rooms? Guns?

692
00:54:03,194 --> 00:54:05,722
I tell you it doesn't
make any difference.

693
00:54:06,197 --> 00:54:08,600
They are through with us here.

694
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,433
What's the use of saying good night?

695
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,492
Good night.

696
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,765
Good night, doctor.

697
00:57:42,024 --> 00:57:44,302
Nora, it's me, Lance.

698
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:51,059
Are you okay?

699
00:57:51,953 --> 00:57:54,454
They've all gone into their rooms,
and locked themselves in.

700
00:57:54,455 --> 00:57:56,039
Lance, I've been thinking.

701
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,251
It was so dark there below.
Maybe it wasn't Mr. Loren.

702
00:57:59,252 --> 00:58:03,408
It was him, alright. He tried to
kill you and he did kill his wife.

703
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:08,011
- How can you be so sure?
- She tried to warn me.

704
00:58:08,012 --> 00:58:09,664
Asked me to help her.

705
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:12,925
The doc thinks he is going
to try and kill one of us.

706
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,729
Now there must be a way out of
this place and I'm going to find it

707
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,731
and get the police before he does.

708
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:20,191
I'm going with you.

709
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:22,469
But if he finds out you're alive...

710
00:58:22,946 --> 00:58:25,948
No, Nora, you're safer
here than any place else.

711
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:28,602
Now just lock yourself
in and keep quiet.

712
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:37,028
If I find a way out,
I'll come back and get you.

713
01:00:27,128 --> 01:00:28,575
No.

714
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:53,560
No.

715
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,566
No.

716
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,504
No.

717
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,067
Lance!

718
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:59,590
An admission of guilt, doctor?

719
01:02:59,591 --> 01:03:02,886
Certainly not. There's either
somebody else in this house

720
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:04,664
or one of us has left his room.

721
01:03:04,722 --> 01:03:06,965
Did you hear anything?

722
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:14,011
- Organ music?
- That and someone walking.

723
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,019
You got yours?

724
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:19,571
Ready?

725
01:03:19,572 --> 01:03:22,816
You look downstairs
and I'll look up here.

726
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:24,034
Why not together?

727
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:27,038
We maybe only minutes,
seconds left to someone's life.

728
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,782
Why waste time?

729
01:04:22,476 --> 01:04:24,503
It's almost over darling.

730
01:04:25,854 --> 01:04:28,508
Every detail was perfect.

731
01:04:41,915 --> 01:04:45,084
- What's happening?
- We've done it.

732
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:49,160
The perfect crime. Beautiful.

733
01:04:49,716 --> 01:04:51,466
Has she killed him?

734
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:52,959
Not yet.

735
01:04:53,011 --> 01:04:54,913
But she will.

736
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:59,669
Get me out of this hanging harness.

737
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:03,396
What's taking that girl so long?
What time is it?

738
01:05:03,397 --> 01:05:06,442
At first I couldn't get Nora to want
to protect herself with a gun.

739
01:05:06,443 --> 01:05:08,068
But after you appeared at the window

740
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:10,487
everything began to work
just as we had planned.

741
01:05:10,488 --> 01:05:11,447
You were wonderful.

742
01:05:11,448 --> 01:05:14,409
Just the touch which finally
drove her into complete hysteria.

743
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,063
It will be worth all of
our planning, darling.

744
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,247
Where is Nora now?

745
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,459
- What's happening?
- On her way to the cellar.

746
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,253
So scared, she'll shoot the
first thing that moves.

747
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:28,033
- And Frederick?
- On his way to the cellar too.

748
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:31,219
David, are you sure none
of them will suspect us?

749
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,304
Of what?

750
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:34,639
An hysterical girl
accidentally shoot somebody?

751
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,559
Who would suspect that
we planned it that way?

752
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,978
- That we drove her to it.
- What about my suicide?

753
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:40,938
For just a ghost party gag.

754
01:05:40,939 --> 01:05:43,776
We'll claim it was a dummy since
I merely want to touch you.

755
01:05:43,777 --> 01:05:45,402
And the caretakers?

756
01:05:45,403 --> 01:05:47,654
Well, they had no idea what
they were really doing.

757
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:49,865
What about Nora?
She's not stupid you know.

758
01:05:49,866 --> 01:05:53,370
Darling, believe me. Everything
we planned is working perfectly.

759
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:55,413
Nora is sure Frederick murdered you.

760
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,624
She can spread Frederick
attacked her the cellar, not me.

761
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:00,002
And now Nora is almost
out of her mind with fear.

762
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:01,670
The heads, the music, your hanging.

763
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:04,298
I tell you, when Frederick
walks in there, she'll shoot him.

764
01:06:04,299 --> 01:06:06,372
It's taking too long.

765
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:09,247
David, you ought to be there.

766
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:21,932
When you hear the shot
come down to the cellar.

767
01:07:28,186 --> 01:07:30,429
Nora! No!

768
01:08:59,622 --> 01:09:01,069
David?

769
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,406
David.

770
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:35,270
At last you've got it all.

771
01:10:35,271 --> 01:10:40,276
Everything I have, even my life.

772
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,279
But you're not going
to live to enjoy it.

773
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,312
Come with me murderess, come with me.

774
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:13,574
Good night, doctor.

775
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:16,290
Good night, Annabelle.

776
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,249
The crime you two planned
was indeed perfect.

777
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:24,629
Only the victim is alive
and the murderers are not.

778
01:12:25,229 --> 01:12:29,525
It's a pity you didn't know when
started your game of murder

779
01:12:29,526 --> 01:12:33,100
that I was playing too.

780
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:39,994
There must be some
way to get in here!

781
01:12:39,995 --> 01:12:42,490
It's right along here, some what.

782
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:45,823
Lance!

783
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:49,244
I've shot Mr. Loren!
He's down in the wine cellar.

784
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:52,160
- Alive?
- I don't think so.

785
01:13:01,937 --> 01:13:04,214
It's him! He's alive!

786
01:13:08,945 --> 01:13:11,518
You didn't shoot anyone, my dear.

787
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:14,648
I loaded your gun with blanks.

788
01:13:15,077 --> 01:13:17,161
I can tell you all now...

789
01:13:17,162 --> 01:13:20,658
Trent and my wife were
planning to kill me.

790
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:22,444
They failed.

791
01:13:23,003 --> 01:13:25,576
Trent tried to throw me in the vat.

792
01:13:26,006 --> 01:13:28,580
My wife stumbled and fell.

793
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:31,678
I'm ready for justice to decide

794
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,085
if I'm innocent or guilty.

795
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,858
Now there are nine.

796
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:01,704
There'll be more, many more.

797
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,165
They're coming for me now.

798
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:13,460
And then they will come for you.
