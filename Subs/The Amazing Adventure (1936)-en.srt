3
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,000
A little more absinthe, Mr. Bliss?

4
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:01,801
No, no, don't bother about it.
I don't know what I want.

5
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,402
Anything wrong, sir?

6
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,303
Yes, everything, Fran�ois.

7
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,104
Let me make you another one.

8
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,605
It won't help.
It's just me, I'm feeling terrible.

9
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,506
Good evening, Lord Honiton.
Oh, good evening, Henri.

10
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,107
Has Mr. Bliss arrived yet?
Mr. Bliss is waiting for you in the bar.

11
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,008
Oh, good. It's busy as ever, I see.

12
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:26,909
Good evening.

13
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,410
Hello, Ronnie. What will you have?

14
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,811
Dry martini, please.
Haven't those girls arrived yet?

15
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:41,212
Not yet. Who cares?

16
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:43,013
Come on, let's sit down over here.

17
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:48,114
Look, Ronnie. I got your note,
but I'm blowed if I'll lend you a 1,000 pounds.

18
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:49,715
Oh, never mind about that.

19
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:52,616
I shouldn't have asked you, really.
But you know how broke I am and you're rolling.

20
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,317
It's not a question of whether or not I can afford it.

21
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,818
The point is it's too easy to lose one's friends
that way.

22
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,900
Let's forget it, shall we?
I shouldn't like anything to spoil our friendship.

23
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,700
Don't let's talk about money anyway, Ronnie.
I feel like an old man.

24
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:06,701
I'm not kidding. There's something in there lying,
something's wrong with me.

25
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:10,052
If you're really feeling ill why don't you let
Sir James Alroyd have a look at you?

26
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,053
Who?
Sir James Alroyd.

27
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:15,554
He's a bit of a quack and he'll charge you 20 guineas
but he's the best diagnostician there is.

28
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:17,455
Oh, no, no, no. He's what?

29
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:20,956
Don't ask me to repeat that.
Anyway, he'll tell you what's the matter with you.

30
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,357
He's the best doctor in London.

31
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:37,258
Oh, snap out of it,
public misery number one.

32
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,759
Come on, let's go and eat.

33
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,360
Yes, I'm hungry.

34
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,661
All right. Here you are.

35
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,662
Thank you, Mr. Bliss.

36
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:48,963
Ernest, everyone's been admiring my bracelet.
It was sweet of you.

37
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,764
Biarritz? That won't do any good.

38
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:30,200
All that woman needs is to sack five of her seven servants

39
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,501
and do six hours of housework a day for three months.

40
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:42,102
I'm afraid you'll break out some day
and tell one of them the truth.

41
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,303
Lord Roberts, please.

42
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:02,104
Just a moment.

43
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:06,605
What is the matter here? My name is Bliss, Ernest Bliss.
I had an appointment for 11 o'clock.

44
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,206
I'm sorry, Mr. Bliss,
but you were half an hour late.

45
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,607
Sir James will see you now, Mr. Bliss.

46
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:32,108
Rather difficult man to see, aren't you,
Sir James?

47
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,509
Not for those who are punctual.

48
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,710
Any other complaints?

49
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:40,111
Do you think I'd have waited an hour and a half
if I hadn't?

50
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:41,412
Oh, forget about that.

51
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:45,813
What do you think is the matter with you?
I don't know. That's why I came to see you.

52
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,414
I can't eat, I can't sleep. I'm nervous.

53
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,915
I never do anything and I'm always tired.

54
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,316
Oh. Just take off your shirt and lie down
on that couch.

55
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:58,517
There's nothing wrong with your blood pressure.

56
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:02,418
Your muscles are a bit flabby
but your heart's quite sound.

57
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,719
Well, what's the matter with me?

58
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,020
Money.
Money? That's not an illness.

59
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:14,621
In your case it's a disease.

60
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:17,122
Most people break down through overwork.

61
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:19,723
Yours is caused by self-indulgence.

62
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:22,324
Really? Is that so?

63
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,925
You know, your father was a clever man.

64
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,800
What are you looking for?
My tie.

65
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:29,999
You've got it on.
Oh.

66
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,400
But he made a big mistake when he left you
2 million pounds to play the fool with.

67
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:39,501
Believe it or not, Sir James, I'm paying you 20 guineas
to give me medical advice. Not a lecture.

68
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:44,202
My advice should be worth fifty thousand pounds
to you.

69
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,703
I suppose I'm getting a bargain for twenty, eh?

70
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:50,604
Certainly, if you take it.
What makes you think I wouldn't?

71
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,705
No patient of mine in Harley Street ever has.

72
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,406
Sounds interesting.

73
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:58,807
What is it?

74
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,408
Well...

75
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,509
Disappear for a time.

76
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,510
Earn your own living. Live on a few pounds a week
if you can make them.

77
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,611
If not, go hungry.

78
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:17,000
Do that for a year and I guarantee
it will make you fit.

79
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,101
That's rather a tall order.

80
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:22,702
Of course a certain amount of moral stamina
will be needed.

81
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,103
You think I've no stamina, eh?

82
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,804
Well, no hard feelings. Good morning.

83
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:31,405
Good morning, Mr. Bliss.

84
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:40,306
You don't seem to like me.
A medical man's time is limited.

85
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,707
Besides, there's so much genuine suffering in the world
that money would alleviate.

86
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:48,208
You should visit my clinic in the East End
if you can spare the time.

87
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,609
I'm being unprofessionally rude, perhaps,

88
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,910
because you're the fifth patient I've had here this morning

89
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,711
suffering from the same complaint:
too much money.

90
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,512
Look here, Sir James.

91
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,614
You just refused to shake hands with me.

92
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:01,415
All right, I'll make you an offer.

93
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,216
Your clinic needs money.

94
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,117
I'll bet you that fifty thousand pounds
you say your advice is worth...

95
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,118
against an apology.

96
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,619
And an honest handshake.

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,120
That I can take your advice and follow it to the letter.

98
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:14,821
That should be quite a simple matter for you.

99
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:21,022
Your bookmaker, your gunsmith, even your tobacconist
might find you a job at a few pounds a week.

100
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:22,423
Not at all.

101
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:24,424
I'll set out with only five pounds.

102
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,125
And without driving the slightest benefit from my name,
money or present position,

103
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:30,826
I'll earn my living for a year.

104
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,727
And if I do touch my own money for my own use,

105
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,028
you get fifty thousand pounds.

106
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,529
Big words, Mr. Bliss.

107
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,330
Big promises.

108
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:43,031
But I'm afraid I can't take them seriously...

109
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,632
from you.

110
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:50,233
Before you gave me that look
there was a sporty chance you'd win.

111
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,734
Now you haven't a hope!

112
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,435
Then the bet is off.

113
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,536
No, the bet's on and I'm going through.

114
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,100
Which is it?
Left.

115
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,401
Oh...

116
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,002
Here we are, Clowes.

117
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:27,603
Better take those heavy shoes along.
I might have to do a lot of walking.

118
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:29,104
Yes.

119
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,805
I guess that's about all now.
I won't need these.

120
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:33,706
No, sir?

121
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,307
Tell me something, Clowes.

122
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,308
Is it true that the hardest job in the world
is doing nothing?

123
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,709
Yes, sir.

124
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,410
Well, I'm afraid that's going to be your job for the next
twelve months.

125
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:45,311
Yes, sir.

126
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,612
Twelve months?
Then where do I send your trunks?

127
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:50,413
Trunks?
No, all I need is in that bag.

128
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:51,914
Yes.

129
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,615
For twelve months?
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:55,916
Yes.

131
00:09:57,017 --> 00:10:00,117
But of course your dress clothes...
No, I won't have any use for them.

132
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:04,118
I'd better take a look around
and see if I haven't forgotten anything.

133
00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:05,319
Yes.

134
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
Oh, Clowes.
Sir?

135
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:14,821
These cigars. Keep them in condition, will you?
They're the last of their crop.

136
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,922
Yes, sir.
Oh, and the wine.

137
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:20,423
Especially the '84 port. I don't want that touched.
Yes, sir.

138
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,224
Your pocketbook, sir.
Ah, yes. Wait a minute.

139
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:33,725
Now look, Clowes. What is this?
A five pound note, sir.

140
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:37,226
Right. Now, you're a witness that this is all the money
I'm taking with me, aren't you?

141
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,527
Yes, sir.
Fine.

142
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:40,428
And your checkbook, sir.

143
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:43,429
No, I won't need that for a year.
At least I hope not.

144
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,330
Put it in the desk drawer...
No, no, don't bother now.

145
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:49,031
If the bank's ready, take it downstairs and fetch me...
No, no!

146
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:52,532
Don't worry. I'll do it myself.
I'd better start now.

147
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,333
Oh, Clowes, refer all letters and inquiries
to Mr. Crawley.

148
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:59,534
And I'll see you back here a year from now.

149
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:02,135
I hope you won't be as bored doing nothing
as I've been.

150
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:07,006
What exactly are you going to do, sir?
That's exactly what I don't know.

151
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:11,107
Well, goodbye, Clowes.

152
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:12,808
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:47,399
He's been out of work and he's owing me a bit.

154
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,800
Well, we pay our rent, Mrs. Heath.

155
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:53,701
And if we can't get Bliss's room, we move.

156
00:12:53,702 --> 00:12:55,602
You can't turn round in here.

157
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:58,903
I can't turn him out into the street,
Mrs. Matthews.

158
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,504
Oh, hello, Mrs. Heath.

159
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,905
You feeling very tired, my dear?

160
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,806
Like a cup of tea?

161
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,807
Haven't you anything else to say to me,
Mrs. Heath?

162
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:42,608
Oh, I'm afraid you overheard.

163
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,909
But don't let it worry you.

164
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,310
Well... thanks for the mending.

165
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,911
In fact, it's looking professional.

166
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,412
Very good tenants, aren't they?

167
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:58,113
Best I've got.
Yes... yes. I haven't paid my rent for two weeks.

168
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:03,214
Not another word.
If they goes, they goes.

169
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,415
Well, that's all right, but you need the money.

170
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,416
Never mind that.

171
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:11,917
There's them that can pay
and them that can't.

172
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,318
And I knows one from another.

173
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:39,200
So, young man.
You want to sell my Alpha stoves.

174
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,401
That's right, sir.

175
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:45,802
Miss Clayton, bring me that file of applications
for this job, please.

176
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,303
Yes, Mr. Masters.

177
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:53,904
Oh, Mr. Masters, why bother going through all those?
After all, I'm here on the spot.

178
00:14:55,005 --> 00:15:00,405
And believe me, Mr. Masters,
this is the first time in my life I've been without a job.

179
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:04,306
You've been very lucky.
But have you ever had one?

180
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:12,107
Now, young man. Twenty-seven applications
from travelers of experience.

181
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,308
Why should I chuck all these and engage you?

182
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:16,809
Well...

183
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,210
Look, Mr. Masters, let me tell you the truth.

184
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,911
I've been walking around for weeks
trying to get a job.

185
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:26,412
If I don't get one soon, I'll starve.
I've got to get this one.

186
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:32,713
Oh, say. I got the job.

187
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:36,300
I was afraid you would.
Mr. Masters can't say no to anyone.

188
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:38,415
Afraid? I can sell stoves.

189
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:43,716
What's your name?
Oh... Ernest Bliss.

190
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:46,717
What's yours?
Clayton.

191
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:51,818
Start tomorrow, April 21st.

192
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,319
Five percent on all sales
and two pounds a week salary, Mr. Bliss.

193
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,320
Bring in the orders to me and come to me for your wages.
Thanks.

194
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,821
Now, here are some catalogs with full details
of the office stove.

195
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,522
Fine.
The price list...

196
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:11,723
And here's your order book.
My what?

197
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:15,524
Your order book.
Oh, order book, yes...

198
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,825
You don't think much of me now,
but you'll be surprised when I get started.

199
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:22,826
Goodbye, Miss Clayton.

200
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:24,627
Still empty.

201
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,128
So you haven't got started yet.

202
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:31,229
I know, Miss Clayton.

203
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,130
But...

204
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:36,031
...in the past few weeks I've tried dozens of firms.

205
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:38,532
And there's always some reason for not buying it,
either...

206
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:41,800
either the stove is too large, or too small,
or the price is too high...

207
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,701
or it isn't advertised enough, or...

208
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:47,002
well, maybe I'm just a rotten salesman.

209
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,703
But I believe in the stove.

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,004
It's a good stove. My luck will change.

211
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,005
You look very tired.

212
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,106
Let me make you a cup of tea.

213
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,807
That's awfully kind of you.

214
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,808
I thought you didn't like me.

215
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:04,409
Business has nothing to do with personal feelings.

216
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,010
May I help you?

217
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,811
I'm worried about Mr. Masters.

218
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:18,512
His life's savings are in this stove.

219
00:18:18,913 --> 00:18:22,213
Oh, bad as all that, huh?
Yes, we'll have to close down shortly.

220
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:23,914
Oh, I'm sorry.

221
00:18:23,915 --> 00:18:26,255
I feel sort of partly to blame, you know?

222
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,116
Oh, you mustn't say that. You did your best.

223
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,417
What will you do now?
Do you live with your parents?

224
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:36,018
No, my mother and sister live up north.

225
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:37,719
I stay at a girls' club.

226
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,220
Pretty rotten life for you, isn't it,
being cooped up in an office like this.

227
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:45,001
Oh, it hasn't been so bad.
At least I've had my job.

228
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:47,502
Yes, you have something to hold on to.

229
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:52,603
If I don't get another quickly I'll have to start hinting
at my friends that I need free meals.

230
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,004
Well, that'll be just as good as...

231
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,205
Free meals?

232
00:18:58,206 --> 00:18:59,606
Yes, if I can get any.

233
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,107
Wait, that gives me an idea.

234
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,108
Five hundred pounds. Right.

235
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,609
So this means that Alroyd gets his 50,000 pounds.

236
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,260
What?
Because you've lost your bet.

237
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:14,999
After all I've been through for the past four weeks
do you think I'm going to quit now?

238
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:19,862
The bet was that you'd live on what had done yourself
without using your own money.

239
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:23,163
Yes. For my own benefit. That was the bet.

240
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:26,164
I'm not touching this. It's for someone else.

241
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:30,765
Look. Here's what I have left from my last week's wages.

242
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,666
And here's what I'm living on.
Good heavens!

243
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,867
Yes, it's just about enough for one meal, too.

244
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,268
Excuse me.

245
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,369
You can't come this way, sir.
Get your place on the queue.

246
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,490
I'm here on business. I want to see the manager.
Where is he?

247
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,571
Oh, he's at the desk, sir.
All right.

248
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:29,272
Good morning.

249
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:31,300
Oh, good morning.

250
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,101
I'm the buyer from Ellerman's Limited.

251
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:35,802
Well, well, won't you sit down.

252
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:36,903
Thank you, thank you.

253
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,204
Oh, miss.

254
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:44,105
Will you tell the chef I've tasted this. I find it excellent,
and to serve it out to the people.

255
00:20:44,106 --> 00:20:45,406
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,007
Pretty enterprising all this.

257
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:50,808
Oh, yes, well it's just a little idea to strengthen
our retail trade, you see.

258
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,609
Oh, you're wholesale.

259
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,810
Well, of course, that's hardly in our line.

260
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:02,311
If you'll excuse me, a moment,
I have a  couple of other buyers waiting for me.

261
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:06,512
Oh, wait a moment. Surely you can spare me
a couple of moments to show me the stoves.

262
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,113
Well... yes, yes. I suppose it can be done.
Come this way, will you?

263
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:23,484
Oh, yes, this little ventilator. It's patented, of course.

264
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:25,515
Yes, the Masters patent.

265
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:28,016
Oh, miss...

266
00:21:28,017 --> 00:21:30,417
Would you mind telling the two gentlemen
that are waiting for me,

267
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:32,908
the two buyers,
that I'll join them in just a moment.

268
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,119
There's no reason to divide the business
between a dozen firms.

269
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,420
Well, of course...
We might be able to manage your entire output.

270
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:45,521
Oh...
In the meantime...

271
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:46,822
I'll order a hundred.

272
00:21:47,423 --> 00:21:50,523
A hundred.
I'm sorry, but that's all I can at the moment.

273
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:53,824
Oh, no... yes, yes...
The usual trade terms.

274
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,325
Well...

275
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,526
Look, old man, I...

276
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,527
I wish you'd wait and see Mr. Masters himself.
He'll be along in just a minute.

277
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,628
While we're waiting, I'll write the order.

278
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:04,929
The er...
The order.

279
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:08,330
Oh, yes, the order.
It's so noisy around here.

280
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,431
The order, yes... I'll get it, I'll get it.

281
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,532
Oh, look at that, look at that.

282
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:22,133
My first order.

283
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,334
What?
In the new book.

284
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,535
I see, here you are, sir.

285
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,256
Oh, Mr. Masters, now.

286
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:33,257
Mr. Masters, I want you to know
the chief buyer at Ellerman's.

287
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:35,658
Good morning, Mr. Masters.
What's the meaning of all this, Mr. Bliss?

288
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:39,459
Ellerman's has just placed an order for 100 stoves.
One hundred?

289
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,440
It's only a trial order, of course.
But we...

290
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,961
I've already explained that we're really not interested
in wholesale business.

291
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:50,800
You must appreciate, Mr. Masters, that if we can
get together, we can take at least 40,000 a year.

292
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,163
Certainly... huh?

293
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:58,364
But are we...
No, no, Mr. Masters, we can at least consider the matter.

294
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:01,665
Think it over.
I know you're busy at the moment.

295
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:05,166
So I'll call at your office tomorrow. Good morning.
Good morning.

296
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,267
Look at that.

297
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:10,868
But where did you get all the money
to run this place?

298
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,769
Well, I'm coming to that.

299
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,070
You see, I borrowed 500 pound on your behalf

300
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:19,971
from a young fool I know who has more money
than is good for him.

301
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:23,872
Here's what's left of it and his solicitor
will send you a bill.

302
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,873
Oh, by the way.
May I?

303
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:29,274
I'm a trifle short. I had to hire this suit.

304
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,875
I owe your commission on 100 stoves.

305
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:36,576
Mr. Masters, I'm afraid I can't take that.
You see...

306
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:38,177
I have to leave your employ.

307
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:41,678
What do you take me for?
You saved me from going under.

308
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,079
No, no. You stay on here as a partner.

309
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,280
Bliss, you can't leave now. Please don't.

310
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,581
Well, I'm afraid I must.

311
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:55,782
These are my own clothes in here.
Goodbye, Mr. Masters.

312
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:59,983
Don't be silly. There's big money in this.
I'm offering you a partnership.

313
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,084
I won't take no for an answer.

314
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:03,885
I'm going to have a look around this place.

315
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:10,386
Miss Clayton, this isn't goodbye for us.
It's all too insane.

316
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:13,087
Yes, I suppose it seems so, but...

317
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:14,988
Look...

318
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:18,589
when I'm settled in my next job can I call you up
and take you to dinner, or a show or something?

319
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,590
Well, there's no use prolonging the agony,
is there?

320
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:26,091
Goodbye.

321
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,992
Ready to order, signori?
Yes, wait a minute...

322
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:53,093
How's the chicken?
Oh, it's very nice.

323
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,794
I knew you'd say that, anyway.

324
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:57,395
Two chickens, eh?
Yes, and er...

325
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,796
two desserts.

326
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:03,797
Desserts and two coffees.
Two desserts and two coffees.

327
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:05,598
How'd you like yours, black?
Black.

328
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,499
All right, two coffees.
Right.

329
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,090
Let's try this.
It's a marvelous wine.

330
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:12,901
I hope you're right.

331
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:16,102
You should have phoned me sooner.

332
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:18,703
Even if you hadn't found work.
I could have paid for the dinner.

333
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,604
Do girls pay for dinners?

334
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:26,105
I hadn't thought about it.
Well, I might not have bought you the wine.

335
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,506
Yes, but this is a celebration.

336
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:33,407
To your entrance into the cabbage business?
No, no. To our first dinner together. Here's to us.

337
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,508
Ah, but it's good!
It's lovely.

338
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:40,809
So cheap, my goodness,
I thought it would taste like red ink.

339
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,610
I fancy it's magic. It's your magic, too.

340
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:47,411
It's you who turned this cheap wine,
this cheap food, into a feast of the gods.

341
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:59,612
I have an idea he's done that for us.
For you.

342
00:25:59,613 --> 00:26:05,313
If signorina and signore would like to dance,
it would give Giuseppe the greatest pleasure.

343
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:07,014
Thanks.

344
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,515
It's funny, that's my favorite dance theme.

345
00:26:09,516 --> 00:26:12,016
Best tune I ever heard.
Come on, let's do something about it.

346
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:29,217
I'm leaving Mr. Masters.
Really, why?

347
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:31,918
For the same reason you did.
What do you mean?

348
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,919
You turned him down so he wants
to make me his partner.

349
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,120
Partner? Why, the old scoundrel.

350
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:40,721
Oh, I don't think so.
I'm rather fond of him.

351
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:44,922
He wants to marry you, eh?
Well, it makes it rather awkward.

352
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:47,123
Two of us in the same office...

353
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:52,424
Yes... but look, Frances, what can a fellow like that
offer a young girl like yourself?

354
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,825
Security.

355
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:55,826
Oh.

356
00:26:57,527 --> 00:26:59,627
Well, what are you going to do?

357
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:02,428
Same thing you've been doing.
Look for something else.

358
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:04,329
Good girl.

359
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,730
It's not so easy, you know.

360
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,001
Your driving test was satisfactory.

361
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:38,502
But driving isn't everything.

362
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:43,003
What we want is punctuality and service.
Yes, sir.

363
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,404
Oh, er... what about my livery, sir?

364
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:47,905
The uniform will cost 10 pounds.

365
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:51,606
We supply it, you pay for it out of your wages.

366
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:53,907
A pound a week, to me.

367
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:56,708
Very good, sir.

368
00:27:57,699 --> 00:28:00,409
Report at seven in the morning.
Yes, sir.

369
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,310
Hello.

370
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:14,111
Did you get the job?
Oh, sure, sure.

371
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:16,712
I thought you would. Of course old Mike's uniform
just about fits you.

372
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:18,213
Here... you can't smoke here, you know.

373
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:20,314
Thanks. It's against the rules.

374
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:22,715
Wait a minute. What was that about Mike
and the uniform?

375
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:25,416
Oh, he got the sack after six weeks.
They always do.

376
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,617
The boss never lets them stay longer.
I thought there was something wrong.

377
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:31,918
Something wrong? Of course there is.
You don't think I'm doing this for nothing, do you?

378
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,019
No, no, I don't suppose you have.

379
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,120
What the blazes do you think you're doing?

380
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,521
I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I didn't notice
you'd parked into this space.

381
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,422
Why don't you look where you're going?
What kind of driver are you, anyway?

382
00:28:48,423 --> 00:28:49,723
Ernest!

383
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,524
Ronnie!
Well, I'll be!

384
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:54,525
How are you?
Say, what do you mean by giving us the slip like that?

385
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:57,526
Yes, well I thought I'd better drop
out of sight for a while.

386
00:28:57,627 --> 00:29:01,427
I say, old man, don't misunderstand me, but if a fiver's
of any use to you for old times' sake...

387
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:03,328
You know, Ronnie, that's funny.

388
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:05,629
Because the last time we met I refused to help you.

389
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,430
Yes, I guess you made me feel pretty ashamed
about that.

390
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:10,031
Honestly, I thought you were rolling.

391
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:15,232
No, Ronnie. Nice of you.
But put it back in your pocket.

392
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:18,133
Thanks.
Okay.

393
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,334
Hey, Ronny!

394
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:22,335
Excuse me a moment, will you?

395
00:29:24,036 --> 00:29:29,136
Don't stand there arguing with that chauffeur.
It's Ernest Bliss. He's working as a chauffeur.

396
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:30,437
Ernest?

397
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:33,338
I'd like to speak to him.

398
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:39,039
No, wait for me. I'd like to speak alone.
Oh, very well.

399
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,340
Ernest!

400
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,141
Claire!

401
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:50,342
Oh, you're with Ronny, huh?

402
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:52,243
Yes.

403
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:57,844
Well, perhaps you'd like to engage a good chauffeur
at your service?

404
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,245
It wasn't very nice of you to chuck us all
just because you had bad luck.

405
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:07,646
Yes, well, Claire, a chauffeur's wages, you know, hardly...
I know.

406
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:11,347
A chauffeur's wages for the whole year wouldn't buy
one of the things you gave me.

407
00:30:12,648 --> 00:30:16,848
I guess you're right. Of course there's always the tips.
You mustn't forget the tips.

408
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,749
You haven't changed.

409
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,450
Goodbye, Ernest.
Bye-bye.

410
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:42,951
I can't understand it.

411
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:45,052
They both came after lunch from Gaultier.

412
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,053
The one I left in his car last night
and this one.

413
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,354
Twin bracelets.

414
00:30:49,455 --> 00:30:50,555
Now I've got one to tell you.

415
00:30:50,556 --> 00:30:52,056
When I was dressing this evening...

416
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:54,257
a bank messenger came to the door of my flat

417
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:57,458
and left a package with ten 100 pound notes in it.

418
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:01,059
A thousand pounds?
You know, it's a funny thing.

419
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,460
When I offered Ernest a fiver yesterday

420
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:06,461
he reminded me that he once refused
to lend me a thousand.

421
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:11,162
It doesn't make sense.
Certainly doesn't.

422
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:24,263
I knew you couldn't resist a call like that.

423
00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:28,564
It is twenty miles out.
Do you need the gloves?

424
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:29,765
No, thank you.

425
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:31,566
Oh, I don't know.
Perhaps you'd better pop them in.

426
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,667
I'll telephone your chauffeur.
No, don't wake him up.

427
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:37,468
Ring up the garage we hired a car from
last time.

428
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:43,969
Hello.

429
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,370
Yes?

430
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,571
Pick up who?

431
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,672
Oh, Dr. Alroyd, yes.

432
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:54,473
19, Dock Road, Poplar.

433
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:55,474
Very good.

434
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:58,175
Smith!
Sir.

435
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:00,776
Take this and go to...
It's my night off, Mr. Edwards.

436
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:04,476
Very well. Send Bliss for the day, then.
Yes, sir.

437
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:12,377
You'd better get home as soon as you've cleared up,
Miss Mills. Good night.

438
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:13,878
Good night, Sir James.

439
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:18,379
Has my secretary told you where to go?
Yes, sir.

440
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,980
Make the best time you can.

441
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,581
It's a very urgent case.

442
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:25,182
Yes, sir.

443
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:53,083
The crisis has definitely passed.

444
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:56,484
Nothing for you to worry about now, Mr. Dankert.
Thanks to you, Doctor.

445
00:32:56,485 --> 00:32:58,985
She said you'd come if I sent you a wire.

446
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:02,086
I didn't believe you would.

447
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:05,087
I don't know what to say. And as for the fee...

448
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:08,088
Oh, there's no fee.
Now just get back and have some sleep.

449
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:10,189
You didn't hardly sleep.

450
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,190
You're a good driver.
Sorry to have kept you up so late.

451
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:34,991
I'd rather have a handshake than this tip,
Sir James.

452
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,192
Why not both?

453
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:41,793
Oh, no. I haven't won that bet yet.

454
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:43,894
What the devil do you mean by that?

455
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:46,995
Well, it'll be seven months next Tuesday.

456
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:50,396
And believe me, the first seven months
are the hardest.

457
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,397
Good night, sir.

458
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:00,999
Well I'll be.

459
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,500
Alora, eh, chef!

460
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,601
Ma per l'amore a Santa Catarina!

461
00:34:09,602 --> 00:34:15,302
Ho ordinato due ravioli di sugo e due frittata.
Ma non � possibile!

462
00:34:35,603 --> 00:34:36,503
Frances, look...

463
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:38,504
supposing you had a lot of money.

464
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:41,705
Supposing you won a sweepstake,
what would you do, huh?

465
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:45,106
I'd never win a sweepstake.
You might.

466
00:34:47,307 --> 00:34:48,607
Well, if I did...

467
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:54,308
I'd buy clothes. Rooms full of clothes.

468
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,909
I'd have a big car, a chauffeur...

469
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,510
If you want all those things so badly,

470
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,011
Masters is doing all right now, isn't he?

471
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:09,212
Yes.

472
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:15,913
My friend from the theater plays
for the signorina?

473
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,314
You're a darling.

474
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,015
Giuseppe, you know, you ought to own this place
not just be head waiter here.

475
00:35:20,116 --> 00:35:21,616
Oh, what I could do.

476
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:24,817
Frances...

477
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,018
Tell me...

478
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:32,519
You wouldn't marry a fellow without a bean
just because you liked him, would you?

479
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,920
No.

480
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:42,321
I was just wondering. I sort of thought
it would be fine if you could.

481
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,522
Won't need you any longer.
Very good, sir.

482
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:53,923
But, er... I want to see you.
Yes, sir.

483
00:35:53,924 --> 00:35:57,824
Can you make it Thursday morning?
Ten o'clock?

484
00:35:56,725 --> 00:36:00,125
Here, sir?
No, my flat.

485
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:03,826
11, Regents Park Gate.
11, Regents Park Gate?

486
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:06,427
Yes. Flat 6.

487
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:11,928
Did... did you say flat 6?

488
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:13,999
Yes.

489
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,400
Come along, come along, my dear fellow.
Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Mr...

490
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:38,301
What's your name?
Er... Brown... Edward Brown.

491
00:36:38,302 --> 00:36:39,302
Brown.

492
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:42,203
Say, that's a very nice cigar you're smoking there.

493
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:45,104
Yes, tiptop condition.

494
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,805
Not many of them left.

495
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:52,306
Sorry to hear that.
You should worry.

496
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:56,607
Have a glass of port.

497
00:36:56,808 --> 00:36:57,999
Thanks.

498
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,500
You do yourself pretty well, don't you,
Mr. Dorrington?

499
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:06,001
I'd say before port, too, isn't it?
Yes.

500
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:11,402
So good it's a pity to drink it.
Yes, I agree with you there.

501
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:17,103
How do you like this place?

502
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:19,404
Oh, it suits me fine.

503
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,805
It belongs to a young fellow who's travelling
around the continent for a bit.

504
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,206
Left his man in charge.

505
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:28,607
The poor fellow having nothing to do
got betting on the dogs.

506
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:32,708
So he lets it to me for a fiver a week.

507
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:37,609
Tell me, where is this man now?
In his room drinking whiskey.

508
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,610
Oh, I see. You fellows drink the port,
he drinks the whiskey.

509
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,611
That's right. But we all smoke his cigars.

510
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:48,112
That's fine. Just one big happy family.

511
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:50,813
You have a cigarette.

512
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,914
Care to have a look around?

513
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,915
I would. It might be very interesting.

514
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,016
Yes.

515
00:37:56,617 --> 00:38:00,117
Of course, since I took possession I've improved
this place a bit.

516
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:01,818
Right.
Look at this.

517
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:05,919
I bought this little fellow meself
in the Caledonian market.

518
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,820
Tasteful, isn't it?
Oh, yes indeed. Makes you think.

519
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,521
Now look here.

520
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,622
Insured for thousands, his butler tells me.
Oh?

521
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:16,023
The city fellow kept it in the hall.

522
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:20,524
It's the Chef Dover of his collection.
I moved it in here right away.

523
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:23,855
Yes, well, look, Mr. Dorrington,
I don't mean to appear inquisitive or anything...

524
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,999
but after all why did you ask me to come here?

525
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:29,957
I'll show you.

526
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:40,458
Anything strike you about that?

527
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:43,159
What do you mean?

528
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,560
That's Ernest Bliss.

529
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,761
The fool who owns this place.

530
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:51,362
Don't you see no resemblance to yourself?

531
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,563
Well, yes, now that you've mentioned it,
I suppose there is.

532
00:38:56,264 --> 00:39:00,464
What would a man like you do for 10,000 pounds?

533
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,965
Ten thousand pounds?

534
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:06,866
Well, practically anything short of murder.
Good boy.

535
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:09,367
Then we understand one another.
Quite.

536
00:39:09,368 --> 00:39:11,468
Now let's get together.

537
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:15,369
I've been practicing Ernest Bliss's signature
for months.

538
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,370
Found his bank books in that drawer.

539
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:21,471
How much do you think he has on current account?
Oh, I haven't the slightest idea.

540
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:23,972
A hundred and sixty thousand odd.

541
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:25,953
A hundred and sixty thousand odd, eh?

542
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:29,754
Isn't it sinful? To think of all that money lying idle.

543
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:31,655
No one to use it.

544
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:34,656
Well, what are we going to do about it?

545
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,557
This.

546
00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:41,958
Pay cash 30,000 pounds.

547
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,159
Ernest Bliss.

548
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,660
Are you going to cash that?
No, you are.

549
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,761
Oh, that's the big idea, eh?

550
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,962
What makes you think I can get away with it?

551
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:58,063
Once you are dressed up in one of Bliss's suits

552
00:39:58,364 --> 00:40:00,264
the bank will pay out, all right.

553
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,665
Simple, isn't it?

554
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,666
So simple, what's to prevent me walking away
with the whole lot?

555
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,167
I am.

556
00:40:08,468 --> 00:40:10,368
Now go and get dressed.

557
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:13,769
I'm coming with you.

558
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,270
Don't feel offended.
But don't you think you'd better stay here?

559
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:30,371
Good morning. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Nice to see you again, Mr. Bliss.

560
00:40:32,072 --> 00:40:34,572
Large amount, isn't it?
Yes, quite.

561
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:42,973
Excuse me, Mr. Bliss, but did you sign this yourself?

562
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,574
Why do you ask?

563
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,075
Well, it seems absurd, since you present it...

564
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:50,976
but if this check came through the ornery way
I'd say it was forged.

565
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:53,277
Congratulations. You know your job.

566
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:56,878
Mr. Bliss, what is the meaning of this?
No time for explanations. I'll tell you what to do.

567
00:40:56,879 --> 00:41:01,279
Get some old papers, shuffle them into an envelope
and pass them out to me quickly. I'm being watched.

568
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,480
Well? Everything all right?
Have you got the money?

569
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:13,981
Relax, take it easy. Everything's fine, perfect.
This fella's grand.

570
00:41:14,182 --> 00:41:17,282
It was so easy it was just like taking candy
from a kid.

571
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,883
You couldn't have found anyone better.
Hey!

572
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,084
Keep your hands off that gun.

573
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:25,285
You trying to double-cross us?

574
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:28,086
No, I'm not trying to double-cross you.

575
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,887
You fellows made a mistake, that's all.

576
00:41:29,928 --> 00:41:32,600
You're very lucky that for reasons of my own
I'm not calling in the police.

577
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:33,901
Now get out of here.

578
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:37,902
What do you mean? What's the game,
Brown?

579
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:41,703
I'm no Brown. I'm Bliss.
You know, the fool that owns this place.

580
00:41:41,904 --> 00:41:43,804
How do you like that?

581
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:46,604
Then why did you cash that check?

582
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:51,105
As you seem to have found out,
I kept quite a lot of money in that account.

583
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:55,206
I just wanted to know whether the bank would recognize
a false signature or not.

584
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,307
Come off it. Think of something better.

585
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,708
All right, you don't believe I'm Bliss,

586
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:03,509
if I can get Clowes away from that bottle,
he'll prove it to you.

587
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,210
What do we care who he is?
I tell you he's got that money.

588
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:10,011
Come on, give it to us.

589
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:13,312
Yes, that's right.

590
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:16,713
Hand it over, Brown.

591
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,514
All right.

592
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:21,715
Harry, watch out!

593
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,816
Somebody ring?

594
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:31,117
Clowes, did you hit him with that bottle?

595
00:44:31,198 --> 00:44:32,718
Yes, sir.

596
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,919
Aw, Clowes, it was the '84 port.

597
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,820
Don't worry anymore about it, Clowes,
I quite understand.

598
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:44,021
Believe me, sir, it was having no work
made me do wrong.

599
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:46,722
It was too hard a job having nothing to do at all.

600
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:49,823
Of course it was.
That used to be the trouble with me.

601
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,124
Sir?

602
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,695
By the way. You'd better keep the rest of that port
locked up.

603
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:55,596
I might need it for a celebration.

604
00:44:55,597 --> 00:44:59,197
Yes, I'm hoping to get married
in about four months.

605
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:02,098
Now, sir. Whatever will you be doing next?

606
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:12,099
Miss Clayton, I want more than just a typist.
I don't quite understand.

607
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,700
All of my most confidential papers will go
through your hands.

608
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:20,601
A relationship of trust, friendship,
I might almost say intimacy is called for.

609
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:22,402
I think I can be trusted, Mr. Montague.

610
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:24,403
Won't you sit down?

611
00:45:25,704 --> 00:45:26,704
Thank you.

612
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:28,905
Are you ready to start work at once?

613
00:45:28,906 --> 00:45:32,306
Of course the figure I mentioned could be raised,
possibly...

614
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:36,007
...if we get on together.
I hope we shall. Mr. Montague.

615
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:42,008
Mr. Montague said he needs me to take notes
for some very important deal.

616
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:46,409
Yes, but behind there's something about that...
that place he's taking you to.

617
00:45:46,499 --> 00:45:51,010
But Ernest, I can't afford to lose my job.
Besides, I can take care of myself.

618
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:55,812
You know, I've got a funny feeling that your employer's car
is going to develop engine trouble.

619
00:45:55,813 --> 00:45:59,013
Oh, so that's why you wanted to know
where he kept his car.

620
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:00,114
Uh-huh.

621
00:46:00,315 --> 00:46:01,715
He can always hire a car.

622
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:05,516
Yes. And he'll tell his secretary
to hire one for him, see?

623
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:07,017
Stupid! Come on.

624
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,718
Good evening, Mr. Montague. Everything's ready.
Oh, good.

625
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,119
Where should I put the typewriter, Miss?

626
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,720
Oh, leave it on the table there.
And get yourself a drink.

627
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:37,921
Thank you, sir.

628
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:39,422
Will you go ahead, Miss Clayton?

629
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,323
Capable fellow that chauffeur you got for me.

630
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:54,624
Very warm in here, isn't it?

631
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:56,925
Won't you sit down, Miss Clayton?

632
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:58,426
Thank you.

633
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:01,927
Make yourself comfortable.

634
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:08,328
And I'll order you a cocktail.

635
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:10,300
Shall I serve the caviar, sir?

636
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:12,501
Put it on the table.
Thank you, sir.

637
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,030
Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment,
my dear...

638
00:47:16,031 --> 00:47:19,331
I'll just go and see if my business friend has come.

639
00:47:19,332 --> 00:47:21,032
Certainly, Mr. Montague.

640
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:31,033
Chauffeur.
Yes, sir.

641
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:33,834
How would you like to earn a fiver?

642
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:35,835
Very much indeed, sir.

643
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:40,436
Tinker about with your engine, and after dinner...

644
00:47:40,737 --> 00:47:43,897
come and report to me.
Report what, sir?

645
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:49,098
That your car's broke down, and there's no train back...

646
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:53,299
you just heard there's a big belt of fog
between here and London.

647
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,700
and there's no chance of getting back
to town tonight.

648
00:47:57,001 --> 00:48:00,201
You won't forget, will you?
Leave it to me. I won't forget.

649
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:01,902
Smart fellow.

650
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:07,603
Dear, dear, dear.

651
00:48:07,604 --> 00:48:09,704
Most annoying.

652
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:12,005
My friend has been held up with the fog.

653
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:16,806
No matter, my dear.
We'll have our little dinner here together.

654
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:20,307
Eh? Just the two of us, before returning to town.

655
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,308
I don't want to be late, Mr. Montague.

656
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,600
I have to be early at the office.

657
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:29,101
Oh, that's all right, my dear, come along,
come along.

658
00:48:30,902 --> 00:48:33,402
Tonight we'll forget the office...

659
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:36,503
Sit here... that's right.

660
00:48:40,304 --> 00:48:42,904
Leave that, I'll see to it.
Very good, sir.

661
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,805
That's beautiful caviar.

662
00:48:47,906 --> 00:48:49,996
Now the fun's going to start.

663
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:51,997
How right you are.

664
00:48:58,498 --> 00:49:00,798
Hello, Frances, we're leaving.
I'm taking you back to London.

665
00:49:01,299 --> 00:49:03,699
How dare you ruin some of the...
Shut up!

666
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,100
Come on, dear.
I shall report you to your mana...

667
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:08,301
Shut up!
Wait for me in the car, dear.

668
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:10,402
Get out of here at once!

669
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:11,903
Shhh.

670
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,804
Eat your caviar.

671
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:25,405
You have the cheek to want your wages
after last night, eh?

672
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:29,406
You can consider yourself lucky
Mr. Montague didn't have you up for assault.

673
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:33,900
I suppose my last four days' pay
goes into your pocket, eh?

674
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,000
No, it does not. And that uniform is not paid for.
Return it.

675
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:40,001
And the poor fellow that gets my job
inherits this uniform

676
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:43,502
and pays you a pound a week for it.
If you don't return it, I'll summons you. Get out!

677
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:46,703
But Mr. Edwards, if this Montague was treating
that girl that way...

678
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:50,204
Bliss did the only thing a decent man could do.
Mind your own business!

679
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:52,505
Oh, thanks, Bill, keep out of this.
It's my funeral.

680
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:56,406
As a matter of fact, Bronson,
your work has been slackening off lately.

681
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:58,207
You can take a week's notice yourself.

682
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,508
Now look here, I'll go. He's got nothing to do with it.

683
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:02,609
Besides, he's got a wife and two kids.
You can't sack him.

684
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,210
Oh, can't I?

685
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:08,611
Look here, when this garage belongs to you,
milord...

686
00:50:08,812 --> 00:50:10,412
I'll accept orders from you.

687
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:11,713
But not before.

688
00:50:11,814 --> 00:50:16,414
Wait! That's the first sensible thing
I've heard you say.

689
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,515
So long, Bill.

690
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,016
No, no, Crawley, don't argue about the price.

691
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:28,717
I'll take the Sun Motor Hire place at that figure.

692
00:50:28,718 --> 00:50:32,318
Now, look. When you close the deal fire Edwards.

693
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,919
Edwards. He's the manager in charge now.

694
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,620
And give his job to a mechanic named
Bill Bronson.

695
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:39,621
No, Bronson.

696
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:42,622
No, no, B-r-o-n-s-o-n.

697
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:44,823
Right.

698
00:50:51,024 --> 00:50:53,724
I'm gonna get that bus driving job in the morning.
He promised me.

699
00:50:54,825 --> 00:50:57,125
Besides, everything's going to be changed
in a few weeks.

700
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:01,026
I... I had a dream the other night.

701
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,727
I guess I dreamt about Cinderella.

702
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:08,028
I was fairy godmother and the prince
all rolled up into one.

703
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:10,829
Ernest, you're absolutely good for nothing.

704
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:15,630
I'd let my family down,
I'd give up everything I ever wanted...

705
00:51:17,731 --> 00:51:19,131
if I marry you.

706
00:51:19,832 --> 00:51:24,032
But you're going to, dear.
I think I must be crazy.

707
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:28,233
You know, Frances, I only made two serious bets
in my whole my life.

708
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:31,034
And I'm gonna win them both.

709
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:32,635
What are they?

710
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:35,536
The first one doesn't matter, but the second one
I made after I met you.

711
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:36,737
Yes?

712
00:51:37,738 --> 00:51:42,838
I bet myself I'd make you marry me
a stove salesman, a greengrocer's assistant, a chauffeur.

713
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:45,239
Then...

714
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,340
you win your bet.

715
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,141
Oh, what a fool I am.

716
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:55,042
Then money and all this don't matter?

717
00:51:57,543 --> 00:51:58,943
They don't exist...

718
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,744
because I love you.

719
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:12,744
Telegram for Miss Clayton. Any reply?
Just a moment, please.

720
00:52:24,345 --> 00:52:28,045
It was unfair to let me tell you this
before I knew you were out of work, Frances.

721
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:36,546
If the doctor says Helen can't live...

722
00:52:37,747 --> 00:52:39,947
unless she's taken to a winter resort,

723
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:43,048
you did quite right to come to London
and tell me.

724
00:52:43,749 --> 00:52:45,849
After all...

725
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,050
I'm her sister.

726
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:50,551
You can't do any more about it than I can.

727
00:52:59,352 --> 00:53:01,152
It was only a crazy dream.

728
00:53:02,953 --> 00:53:04,753
Dreams don't come true.

729
00:53:06,154 --> 00:53:07,854
Not for people like us.

730
00:53:19,455 --> 00:53:22,655
It'll be all right with Helen.
I'll send her to Switzerland.

731
00:53:22,756 --> 00:53:25,356
But you said you...
But I know where I can get a job.

732
00:53:26,457 --> 00:53:28,657
From a man who's very fond of me.

733
00:53:29,858 --> 00:53:31,358
A good man, mother.

734
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:34,159
A fine man.

735
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,560
He wants to marry me.

736
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:06,861
No, Miss Clayton has left here.

737
00:54:07,362 --> 00:54:10,462
Her new address? I'm afraid I don't know.

738
00:54:24,063 --> 00:54:25,563
It's been two weeks.

739
00:54:25,564 --> 00:54:27,064
Not a word.

740
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:29,365
They don't even know at the place she lived
where she's gone.

741
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,906
She took her things with her.

742
00:54:31,057 --> 00:54:33,567
If you should you spend all your time looking
for this young lady...

743
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:36,168
I presume you've left your employment on that bus.

744
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:37,569
Of course, of course I have.

745
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:41,370
But if you draw money from me and buy her jewels,
dresses, and things like that...

746
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:43,571
what about your bet?

747
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:47,072
It's only a few more days.
This is a matter of 50,000 pounds.

748
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:49,173
All right, then. Pay Alroyd his 50,000 pounds.

749
00:54:49,574 --> 00:54:53,574
Don't you see? If I go through with this bet
it may lose me Frances. Can't you understand that?

750
00:54:53,675 --> 00:54:56,275
I'm afraid I can't.
Well...

751
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:00,376
I wanted her to take me the way
she thought I was, poor.

752
00:55:00,677 --> 00:55:02,677
And that wasn't fair to her, was it?

753
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:07,578
So you're going to lose 50,000 pounds
just to satisfy this girl.

754
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:12,579
Oh, what's the use of talking to you about love?
Very little, no doubt.

755
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,980
But would a young lady disappear like this
if there weren't some other interest?

756
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:19,481
Nonsense, she loves me, she said so,
I know she does.

757
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,282
There's never been anybody else.

758
00:55:24,883 --> 00:55:26,283
She wouldn't do that.

759
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:29,084
She couldn't do that.

760
00:55:29,185 --> 00:55:33,085
Whatever that may be, I rather fancy
that is just what she has done.

761
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:52,000
Say, does Miss Clayton work here?
Yes.

762
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:54,801
But she usually doesn't come in until after 10
now she's back with Mr. Masters.

763
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:56,302
Look here...

764
00:55:57,403 --> 00:55:58,833
Hey, what are you after?

765
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:00,334
When you see Miss Clayton hang this sign up.

766
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:02,435
Don't worry about it. It's a little joke of mine.

767
00:56:02,436 --> 00:56:04,999
I'll be at the outside door.
And don't you let her see you do it.

768
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,537
Hello, Frances.

769
00:56:18,038 --> 00:56:19,738
I was afraid you'd find me.

770
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:22,539
What's the matter? Why won't you look at me?

771
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,220
I'm going to marry Mr. Masters.

772
00:56:32,421 --> 00:56:33,621
Goodbye, Ernest.

773
00:56:35,222 --> 00:56:36,022
Good morning, Miss.

774
00:56:36,023 --> 00:56:40,523
Oh, dear me, not working.
Oh, that is tough luck, isn't it?

775
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:42,624
All those flights of stairs, too, eh?

776
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:43,825
Same old office?

777
00:56:45,326 --> 00:56:49,926
Frances, really, I've hunted everywhere for you.
I even gave up my job to look for you.

778
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:52,127
Probably the last one I'll ever have.

779
00:56:57,328 --> 00:56:59,128
Won't you go, please.

780
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:01,299
You only make things harder for both of us.

781
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:05,700
Well, remember Browning's poem, "The Last Ride Together"?
Why can't we have a last walk together?

782
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,901
Look, Frances, let me get this clear.

783
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:12,402
Why did you decide not to see me anymore?

784
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:14,803
Oh, fool!

785
00:57:18,604 --> 00:57:22,804
Was it because you knew if you saw me
you couldn't go back to Masters?

786
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:24,505
Oh, please don't, Ernest.

787
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:27,806
Two people like us haven't an earthly chance.

788
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:30,107
Not together we haven't.

789
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:32,908
Tell me, are you in love with this stove king?

790
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:40,909
No answer?
So you're marrying him for his money, eh?

791
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,410
Yes. Now will you go?

792
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:48,011
No!
What made you change your mind?

793
00:57:48,082 --> 00:57:50,712
Frances, we found something together
worth more than money.

794
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:57,513
I can't let you go thinking that about me.

795
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,214
Listen, Ernest...

796
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:03,315
It isn't for myself.
My sister's seriously ill.

797
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:06,116
And this is the only possible way I can help her.

798
00:58:06,117 --> 00:58:08,917
Oh, darling, why didn't you tell me so before?

799
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:11,318
You had your own worries...

800
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:14,519
and there wasn't anything you could do.

801
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,620
But don't you see? I thought you were doing it for furs,
and jewels, and cars, and all that kind of stuff.

802
00:58:21,421 --> 00:58:23,221
Oh, they wouldn't have mattered.

803
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:26,922
You do see why I have to do it, don't you?

804
00:58:27,723 --> 00:58:29,223
Goodbye.

805
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,324
Let me go now.

806
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:40,625
We're only making it worse.

807
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:43,526
No, Frances, I've got to talk to you.

808
00:58:44,627 --> 00:58:48,427
Diamond bracelets, three vanity bags,

809
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:52,528
two rings, one pair of diamond earrings,

810
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,929
one diamond broche, one diamond hairclip...

811
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:57,830
one jewel case.

812
00:58:58,231 --> 00:59:00,131
Twelve sets of lingerie.

813
00:59:09,432 --> 00:59:12,332
Giuseppe!
Ah, signore!

814
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:14,433
No, no, none of that!
Now look.

815
00:59:14,434 --> 00:59:16,334
Now that you own that restaurant,

816
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:19,235
don't forget, never charge more than the usual
one and six for dinner.

817
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:22,636
Whenever you see a young fellow with a young girl
and they seem hard up...

818
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,937
throw in the wine and charge it to me,
will you?

819
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:27,538
Si, si, signore, mille grazie.

820
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:29,939
Your word is my law.

821
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,340
Dear ol' Ernie Bliss. Never knew the difference
between a commutator and a decoration.

822
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,241
Hello, Claire, how are you?
Hello, Ronnie.

823
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,642
Hello, Ernest, thanks so much for what you did.
Make it a couple of thousand next time, will you?

824
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:45,043
I see there is a Santa Clause, Ernest.

825
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:49,144
Listen, Claire, I wouldn't mention it if I were you.
There's somebody coming along who might not like it.

826
00:59:49,345 --> 00:59:50,945
Right.
Come meet some friends.

827
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:55,846
Miss Wynton, Lord Honiton.
How do you do?

828
00:59:59,147 --> 01:00:02,947
Hello, dear.
It was you has sent the money.

829
01:00:02,948 --> 01:00:08,648
Oh, sir, I can't say no words.
It makes me cry.

830
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,449
Oh, now, Mrs. Heath.

831
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:13,450
You were very kind to me.
You taught me much.

832
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:15,651
Look, you've worked very hard.

833
01:00:15,752 --> 01:00:18,552
I just want to know that you'll be taken care of
the rest of your life.

834
01:00:18,553 --> 01:00:20,553
God bless you, son.

835
01:00:21,054 --> 01:00:22,754
Giuseppe! Come over here.

836
01:00:22,755 --> 01:00:26,555
Sit with Mrs. Heath. And look out for her.
She has a way of stealing into people's hearts.

837
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:30,056
Buona sera, come sta? Va bene?

838
01:00:36,957 --> 01:00:38,957
And my apologies.

839
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,958
Although I lost my bet?
Only by three days.

840
01:00:41,959 --> 01:00:45,859
You win.
You carried out my prescription to the letter.

841
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,160
And I can't accept the check.

842
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,361
Well, Sir James, that's an academic point.

843
01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:54,862
You see, you'd have had your 50,000 pounds anyway.

844
01:00:55,263 --> 01:00:58,163
I decided that the night I drove you
out to the country.

845
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:04,464
Now that you're all here, my friends...

846
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:06,265
you who have been so kind to me the past few months...

847
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:07,866
I want you to meet my wife.

848
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:11,967
Frances!

849
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:14,268
Are you ready?
They're all waiting for you.

850
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:23,269
Darling. You're crying.

851
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,170
What's the matter, baby?

852
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:32,571
Cinderella didn't cry in the story.

853
01:01:34,072 --> 01:01:36,572
but she would have in real life.

854
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:39,373
I'm too happy not to cry.

855
01:01:39,674 --> 01:01:41,574
Too happy!

856
01:01:46,075 --> 01:01:51,075
