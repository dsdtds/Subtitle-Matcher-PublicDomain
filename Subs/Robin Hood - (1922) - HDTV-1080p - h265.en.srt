2
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:38,149
So, I would tell you
what year it was,

3
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,215
but I can't actually remember.

4
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,289
I could bore you
with the history,

5
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:47,392
but you wouldn't listen.

6
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:53,627
What I can tell you is that
this is the story of a thief.

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,303
But it doesn't begin
with the thief you know.

8
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:07,474
Just gonna
clean out the stables.

9
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,624
So, what were you doing?

10
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:21,725
None of your business.

11
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:23,290
It is, if you're
stealing that horse.

12
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,364
They have a break
coming in a minute,

13
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:31,197
so if you're hoping to make a clean
getaway, I'd give it a second.

14
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:33,531
Break time.

15
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:38,805
I'm Rob.

16
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,811
I'm busy.

17
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,346
A thief's work is never done.

18
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:46,415
A man lives next door to me.
His horse died.

19
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,514
If he can't plow,
he can't feed his family.

20
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:54,322
I figured whatever spoiled toff lives
in this manor wouldn't miss one of his.

21
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:57,627
Then you would be absolutely
right, he wouldn't.

22
00:01:57,657 --> 00:02:01,092
Lords that are born with everything,
want for nothing...

23
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:02,828
They make me sick.

24
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:06,298
You don't work in the mines.

25
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,169
Hands too soft
for a tradesman.

26
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:14,710
Who are you?

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,075
I'm the spoiled
toff who lives in this manor.

28
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:23,515
And you are
completely beautiful.

29
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,451
What about my horse?

30
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,288
He's yours,

31
00:02:32,356 --> 00:02:34,826
if you tell me your name.

32
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,569
Marian.

33
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:48,372
You can call me Marian.

34
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,714
Robin and Marian.

35
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:56,215
Seasons passed,
their romance blossomed.

36
00:02:56,245 --> 00:03:00,116
They were young, in love,
and that was all that mattered...

37
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:01,852
until...

38
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:07,156
the cold hand of fate
reached out for them.

39
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:21,307
He stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.

40
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:23,876
It became a bedtime story.

41
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:27,447
But listen, forget history.

42
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:29,449
Forget what
you've seen before.

43
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,814
Forget what
you think you know.

44
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:36,519
This is no bedtime story.

45
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:43,829
If stealing a few coins
was all he did, all he was,

46
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:48,567
Robin of Loxley
would never have become...

47
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,332
Robin Hood.

48
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,854
I knew him when he was just another
lord of the manor.

49
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:11,623
A good life, an easy one.

50
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:15,755
Born with everything, want for nothing.

51
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,361
Go away!
Come back never!

52
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,737
What
he didn't know was...

53
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,444
what we are born into...

54
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,578
What's this?

55
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,578
isn't always who we are.

56
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,044
Look alive, ladies.

57
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,880
We don't want these bloody savages
knowing we're coming, do we?

58
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,317
Sooner we win this war, sooner Loxley
there gets what he wants most.

59
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:52,320
Back home to his sweetheart.

60
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,749
Take cover!

61
00:05:57,955 --> 00:05:58,956
Can't see him!

62
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:15,606
Gisbourne!

63
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:25,385
He's reloading.
Listen up.

64
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:27,054
Two volunteers
for a back slang.

65
00:06:27,084 --> 00:06:28,318
Hmm?

66
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,588
Clayton! You up for a run?

67
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:33,426
Yeah.

68
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:34,958
- You ready? Okay. Let's go.
- Yeah.

69
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,528
Go!

70
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:40,463
Go!

71
00:06:47,604 --> 00:06:48,805
Stay close.

72
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:12,728
Give me a hand.

73
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:17,170
Don't go anywhere.
I've got this one, okay?

74
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,570
You stay here,

75
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,135
- watch our backs, okay?
- Okay.

76
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:24,039
Be back in a minute.

77
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:48,029
Three.

78
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:49,864
Come on, Loxley.

79
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,901
Five, six.

80
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,506
Move, move.

81
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,010
Move!

82
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,019
Rob!

83
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,121
Robin!

84
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:24,533
Where's Clayton?
Where is he?

85
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:25,769
They've taken him.

86
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,571
Stay with the unit, Loxley.

87
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,435
He's still alive.
I can hear him.

88
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:44,253
Loxley!

89
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:46,484
If he's not dead,
he wishes he were.

90
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,724
Leave him to it.

91
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:51,494
Rob! Rob!

92
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:53,225
Loxley, leave him.

93
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:32,629
Cover.

94
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,533
- Clayton!
- Rob!

95
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:42,806
Ambush!

96
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,616
Rob!

97
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,178
Signal the
Stone Throwers, now!

98
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,113
Yes, sir.

99
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:23,216
Loxley,
the stones are coming!

100
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,882
Fall back!
That's an order!

101
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:29,955
Loxley, leave him!

102
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:31,590
You'll get us
all killed, lad!

103
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,824
He's still alive.

104
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:33,959
We can't just leave him!

105
00:10:33,989 --> 00:10:35,958
Not your call,
it's an order!

106
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:48,603
They're coming
like bloody locusts!

107
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:57,804
Come on! See why you should
follow orders, Your Lordship?

108
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,874
We're pulling back
to the encampment.

109
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:09,285
Oi,
I want information.

110
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:13,419
Intelligence, garrison,
troop movements.

111
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:17,389
Get on your knees,
you pig.

112
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:21,059
Come on, move, move!

113
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:24,363
I said,
"Don't look at me!"

114
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,201
On your knees.

115
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,438
- I'm begging you.
- Say it!

116
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:30,139
I'm begging you.

117
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,170
Do it.

118
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,703
Gis!

119
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:37,746
What are you doing?

120
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:39,448
My duty, Loxley.

121
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,449
We have new orders
from above.

122
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,852
Like it or not, soldier,
we're all powerless here.

123
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:46,854
But they're unarmed.

124
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:49,987
Then, why don't you run along
and say a prayer for them?

125
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,365
- Mutton.
- Sir?

126
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,697
- Bring another one out.
- Gladly.

127
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,104
Come here.

128
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:09,976
No!

129
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,112
Come here.

130
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,947
Saleem! Saleem!

131
00:13:12,977 --> 00:13:14,115
- On your knees.
- Let him live.

132
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,179
Stay down!
Let him live.

133
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,985
He's my son.
He's just a boy.

134
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,481
He's my son.

135
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,854
Let him live, I'll tell you what I know.
Everything.

136
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:26,990
He knows nothing.

137
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,162
Me for him!

138
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,998
I've been killing
Crusaders all my life.

139
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,301
My every breath is an
insult to your God. Please!

140
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,502
Yeah,
you're right, Moor.

141
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:39,039
So, if you want to save
your son, give me something.

142
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,403
- Give me something!
- Baba, save me!

143
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:43,839
A thousand soldiers.

144
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,279
To the East.

145
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:48,844
Our forces routed Tadmur
the day before last.

146
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,117
Something else.

147
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,785
I don't have anything else!

148
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,420
He's my son.

149
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,318
I'm just trying
to save my son.

150
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,159
Well, if it's
any consolation...

151
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,827
- Baba, save me!
- ... you can't.

152
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:03,493
Sal! Sal!

153
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:05,863
Saleem!

154
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:08,200
- Saleem!
- Save me!

155
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,298
No!

156
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,505
Rob! Calm down, Rob!

157
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:15,140
Calm down, Rob!

158
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,842
Stand down, Loxley!

159
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,243
Remember your place.

160
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:19,274
Kill the boy!

161
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:20,509
No!

162
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,813
Saleem!

163
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,351
Saleem, Saleem.

164
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:35,121
Hold him!

165
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:38,263
Hold him!

166
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:41,161
- I'll kill you!
- Put him down! Put him down!

167
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,968
If you weren't a lord,
I'd have you hung for treason.

168
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:52,973
Flick this worthless toff
on a hospital boat back to England.

169
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:39,453
I got you something.

170
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:45,594
Key to your manor?

171
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:48,130
It's our home now.

172
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,963
I want to know you're there
while I'm gone.

173
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:57,502
I love you.

174
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:00,473
Marian.

175
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,509
Stay alive.

176
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:07,412
And come back.

177
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,547
I promise you...

178
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:12,183
I'm coming back.

179
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,213
Nottingham
off the starboard.

180
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:42,042
Drop the anchor,
gangway.

181
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,123
Marian!

182
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,598
Marian!

183
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,103
What would you confess,
my son?

184
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:22,446
Tuck, where is Marian?

185
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,477
Robin?

186
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:26,747
Robin, you're not dead?

187
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:30,583
No, not for want of trying.

188
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,592
But your name was read out
from the list of fallen soldiers.

189
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:36,460
- What?
- Two years ago.

190
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,362
We were told
you were dead.

191
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:41,197
Marian had a memorial for you.
It was lovely.

192
00:18:41,227 --> 00:18:42,532
I wrote you
a very moving eulogy.

193
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:44,133
It's a pity you missed it.

194
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:47,537
Well, I'm thrilled you missed it,
'cause it would have been

195
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,172
completely inappropriate,
given you are not dead.

196
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:50,741
- Tuck!
- Yes?

197
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:53,740
Who read my name from
the list of fallen soldiers?

198
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:57,246
The Sheriff, but, Robin...

199
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,276
Where is Marian?

200
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:05,584
Look, things have taken rather a turn
since you've been gone, Robin.

201
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,190
After you died,

202
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,226
the Sheriff seized
Loxley Manor

203
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:15,431
as collateral for his war tax
and threw Marian out.

204
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:16,798
And it's not just her.

205
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:19,334
He's crushing us all
with his war effort.

206
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:21,270
Tolls, collections.

207
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,236
Rob, he's driven most of the commoners
out of Nottingham proper.

208
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,441
To where?

209
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:27,472
To the mines.

210
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,845
She's there now?

211
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,811
Yes, but, Rob, Marian's...

212
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:35,847
This is not
going to end well.

213
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:01,909
You grab him!

214
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,277
Sheriff's orders.

215
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:04,375
Bring them
up this way.

216
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,347
Tastes worse.

217
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:41,301
You?

218
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,371
What the hell
are you doing here?

219
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,377
We've got unfinished business.

220
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,648
No, no business,
you tried to kill...

221
00:21:50,678 --> 00:21:52,683
I stowed away for three
months on your ship.

222
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:54,518
I could have killed you
there if I wanted to.

223
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,215
Not why I'm here.

224
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,454
I've seen your woman, English.

225
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,527
She is beautiful.

226
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:05,561
She's not mine anymore,
not since the sheriff...

227
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,426
Shipped you off to war.

228
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,867
You should have killed me.

229
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:13,370
Everyone thinks I'm dead,
so this must be hell.

230
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,805
You want to know
what hell is?

231
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,706
I lost my hand in this war.

232
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,641
My people were in chains.

233
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,443
My land was pillaged.

234
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,441
And my son was murdered.

235
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:31,921
I'm sorry
I couldn't save him.

236
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,419
But you tried to.

237
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,593
In all my years of war,
I've never seen anything like it.

238
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,430
That's why I chose you.

239
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,738
Chose me? What for?

240
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,741
This war, all wars,

241
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:55,443
and everything happening
here, it's as old as time.

242
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,445
Rich men getting richer.

243
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,815
Men of power taking more power
from the blood of innocents.

244
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:03,281
Yours, mine,

245
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,649
and my son's.

246
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,485
And I want to stop it.

247
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,025
But I cannot do it alone.

248
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,893
We're just two men.
What can we do?

249
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,403
You're only powerless
if you believe you're powerless.

250
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,073
Follow me, English.

251
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,378
Good day, good people!

252
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,854
Today, we face a threat

253
00:24:14,884 --> 00:24:18,557
from these barbarians
in Arabia.

254
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,458
They hate us...

255
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:23,860
Our freedom,
our culture, our religion.

256
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:28,767
But today, they face The Near Enemy,

257
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:31,803
which is our Crusaders,
in the desert.

258
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,071
Let's start here.

259
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:35,707
But tomorrow, and make
no mistake about this,

260
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:38,945
they regard us,
here, in Nottingham

261
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:43,581
as the Far Enemy,
and they will come here.

262
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,851
They will infiltrate,
they will proliferate,

263
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:48,119
they will choke our courts

264
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:50,956
and strangle our church,

265
00:24:50,986 --> 00:24:54,859
our children,
with their fanatical dogma.

266
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:57,062
They'll burn your houses.

267
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,926
They'll burn your lands!

268
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,899
That's why my War Tax Bill

269
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,401
is so vital.

270
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,476
Nottingham isn't just a city.

271
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:16,646
It's the bank and beating heart

272
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:21,551
of our great church
and its glorious Crusade.

273
00:25:21,581 --> 00:25:25,956
And for every one of you
who shirks his duty

274
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,691
by not paying
his fair share,

275
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:31,027
an archer goes
without arrows

276
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:34,063
and a Christian
soldier starves.

277
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:36,861
Sheriff, my people have already given
everything that they have.

278
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,771
I move we send my
tax bill to the vote.

279
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:42,839
I second.

280
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,908
The people of Nottingham
are dying.

281
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:46,709
We're beyond
the breaking point.

282
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,045
Young lady, you have no idea
what a breaking point is

283
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:50,710
until you've seen combat.

284
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:54,145
So, how would you know?

285
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:59,688
Finance Minister,
do we have a decision?

286
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:00,853
- We do.
- Uh, sir?

287
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,793
Uh, sir? Sheriff?

288
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:07,029
The Loxley vote
hasn't been counted.

289
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:08,630
Robin of Loxley?

290
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,994
What, are we giving
votes to ghosts now?

291
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,871
Yes. Uh, no, he's alive.

292
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,037
Sir, so I hear.

293
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,110
Alive?

294
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,776
He was seen today,
home from war.

295
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:31,816
Who saw him?

296
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:36,124
I'm sorry, sir, that falls
under the Seal of the Confessional.

297
00:26:36,154 --> 00:26:37,725
So, you saw him?

298
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:40,062
No, I didn't say...

299
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:42,730
It could have been

300
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,863
anyone saw him.

301
00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:49,704
Oh, dear.

302
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,036
Well, then the vote must be delayed
until the Loxley vote's been counted.

303
00:26:59,642 --> 00:27:00,815
You okay?

304
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:02,116
This council meeting

305
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:04,284
- is adjourned.
- Yeah.

306
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:06,586
Strangle our children,
burn our lands.

307
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:08,121
He acts like you lot
are swarming the bloody

308
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:10,023
walls of Nottingham already,
the lying bastard.

309
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:12,092
Do you want to get angry
or do you want to get even?

310
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,626
I want to take
the sheriff down.

311
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:14,794
I want to hit him
where it hurts.

312
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:17,763
One thing
keeps him in power.

313
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:18,932
He's got the whole church
behind him.

314
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:20,000
He's got an army of...

315
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,064
The money.

316
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,003
What, you mean what he takes
from the commoners for the war effort?

317
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,775
We steal it.

318
00:27:29,805 --> 00:27:30,909
You heard him.

319
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:34,646
Nottingham is the bank
and the beating heart of the Crusades.

320
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:37,646
And I want to put
a knife through it.

321
00:27:38,214 --> 00:27:39,581
Vengeance for you

322
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:41,917
and justice for my son.

323
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:49,625
I'm Robin.

324
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:55,164
Yahya ibn Umar.

325
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,333
Yokhya...

326
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:04,709
No.

327
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:05,843
Please, no more.

328
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,275
In your language,
it's John...

329
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:09,147
Son of Umar.

330
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:10,611
John it is.

331
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:19,057
By night, you'll be hitting
the sheriff's couriers,

332
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:22,123
toll takers, tax collectors.

333
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:25,860
And by day?

334
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:30,767
You'll be playing Lord Loxley,
back to your old self.

335
00:28:30,797 --> 00:28:33,371
Drinking and dining with some of
the most obnoxious people on Earth.

336
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:36,407
- The rich.
- And why will I be doing that?

337
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:39,073
Because if you want to know
where the war money is really going,

338
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:42,776
you will have to charm your way
into the belly of the beast.

339
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:46,083
Find out who is
pulling the strings.

340
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:48,181
Rob?

341
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,650
Marian.

342
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:53,919
I knew she'd come.

343
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:58,261
Whatever it is she wants,
she cannot know

344
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,625
- what we're doing.
- Rob?

345
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,196
It's too dangerous
for her and us.

346
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:07,970
If we get caught,
they will kill us all.

347
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,704
No matter how much you want
to, you cannot go down there.

348
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,406
If you love her,

349
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,842
stick to the plan.

350
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:55,311
I didn't cross an ocean to
watch you crawl into a bottle.

351
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:07,228
Maybe she will love
you again, I nshallah,

352
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:09,793
when she finds out the
truth of what we're doing.

353
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:12,997
But not before then.

354
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,971
Well, then,
let's get on with it.

355
00:30:23,273 --> 00:30:25,175
You're slow
as the Second Coming.

356
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,283
Yeah, well, I spent four years
of my life killing your people.

357
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,850
Well, you missed me.

358
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,186
Yeah, well,
nobody's perfect.

359
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:33,350
You must be.

360
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:36,023
I can fire
two arrows a second.

361
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:38,889
Yeah, you could fire
two arrows a second.

362
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,959
You think you're faster?

363
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:46,396
Shoot me.

364
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:50,434
- Beg your pardon?
- You've killed hundreds of us!

365
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,236
What's one more?

366
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:55,238
Okay.

367
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,979
Please. I said shoot me.

368
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:04,816
Too slow.

369
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,485
Fast as you can!

370
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:08,049
Again, come on, English!

371
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:16,324
Again.

372
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,332
Too slow.

373
00:31:26,402 --> 00:31:28,370
This war will be
fought up close.

374
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:31,273
You'll need
a street weapon.

375
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:35,176
Give me that relic,
it's firewood.

376
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:37,583
Relax your grip.

377
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:39,947
Allow the bow
to rest in your palm.

378
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:41,782
Now try.

379
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,024
Try again.

380
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:49,995
Only this time,
try the other side.

381
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:52,059
It will save you a second
on the reload.

382
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,967
Yes. Come on!

383
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,273
Again!

384
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,305
Faster!
Yes, English, faster!

385
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:12,283
You were a lord,
but now, you get to be a thief.

386
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:14,251
Left!

387
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,948
And I'm going
to show you how.

388
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:23,460
This won't be like
any war you're used to.

389
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,525
Right! Left!

390
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:26,959
Arrows.

391
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,030
To the right.

392
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:33,102
Exactly.

393
00:32:33,132 --> 00:32:35,338
Faster. Stronger!

394
00:32:35,368 --> 00:32:36,869
Faster, English!

395
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,646
What are you doing
to my coat?

396
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:45,214
It's too long.

397
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:47,015
It's slowing you down.

398
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,148
When do I actually get
to, you know, steal?

399
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:52,384
Really liked this coat.

400
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,991
Well, now, it's a jacket.

401
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:57,926
Turn your hand
into a quiver.

402
00:32:57,956 --> 00:33:01,096
The more arrows you can hold,
the more arrows you can fire.

403
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,528
Shut up, you're not making
it easier, you know?

404
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:04,429
Yes! Yes!

405
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:27,988
Fight with stealth,
strike from the shadows.

406
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:29,653
By the time they return fire,

407
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:32,890
you're gone.

408
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,129
What else you got?

409
00:33:58,214 --> 00:34:00,120
You've been digging
through my old laundry, John.

410
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,122
You cannot go see the
sheriff in those rags.

411
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:06,159
You must donate to his war effort
and you will get in good with him.

412
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:07,227
Get in good with him?

413
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,095
He'll be lucky if I
don't take his head off.

414
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,265
We pull the tail,
you see who bites.

415
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,434
- So...
- So, to follow the money,

416
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:16,298
you must gain
the trust of the sheriff.

417
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:19,739
And what am I
going to donate?

418
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:22,272
It's not exactly like we're
rolling in coin, is it?

419
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,973
Tonight, you take down
the toll bridge.

420
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:27,614
Now you're talking, John.

421
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:29,645
I'm glad you approve, English.

422
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,181
What is this?

423
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:34,016
That was my son's.

424
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:37,757
Thank you.

425
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:39,688
You wanted to steal?

426
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,723
Now's your time.

427
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,098
Take that load
off to the treasury.

428
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:47,065
You, come on.

429
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:50,002
By the order of the Sheriff of
Nottingham, you need to pay the toll.

430
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:51,370
Stop the cart!

431
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,004
You have to pay
the sheriff's toll.

432
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:55,273
- Didn't used to have to pay.
- Check this bag.

433
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,476
Come on, what you got
in the back?

434
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,339
We have no more money!

435
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:03,080
Come on, old man,
cough it up!

436
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,343
Get up!

437
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:07,315
Hey!

438
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:26,367
Hey!

439
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:28,705
Where is he?
Where did he go?

440
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,670
- Where the hell are they?
- I can't see him. Where is he?

441
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:39,380
Too slow.

442
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:02,435
Lord Loxley.

443
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:08,477
All of Nottingham rejoices

444
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:11,413
that the tragic rumors
of your death are unfounded.

445
00:36:11,443 --> 00:36:14,551
I'd like to thank you
personally for your service.

446
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:17,686
You sent me off
for a just cause.

447
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,455
It was my honor, sir.

448
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:23,759
Ah, I do hope you're not going to hold
my seizing of your manor against me.

449
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:25,394
It's a pity
it's a fog of war.

450
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:26,629
Don't give it
a second thought.

451
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,192
I'm fixing it up already.

452
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,296
You did
what you had to do, sir.

453
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,204
And here's my fair share
for the war effort.

454
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:38,307
But you've already
given so much.

455
00:36:38,337 --> 00:36:39,508
No, our troops need it.

456
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:40,538
I should know.

457
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:42,840
I was there.

458
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:47,912
Please.

459
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:56,189
Well, I hope, now that you're back,
I get to see a lot more of you.

460
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:58,326
As much as
you'll allow, sir.

461
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:00,258
I hope to earn your favor.

462
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:36,797
You put the rest of us to shame
with your generosity, Loxley.

463
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,166
I'd like to be able
to count on an invitation

464
00:37:39,196 --> 00:37:40,600
the next time
the lords meet, sir.

465
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,834
But it's your right.
It would be my pleasure.

466
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:45,806
After all, the youth vote
could use a voice in chambers.

467
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:47,607
You flatter me
with your confidence, sir.

468
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:48,705
Yes, I know.

469
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Rob.

470
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,188
The other day,
at the manor,

471
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,594
I came by.
I needed to see you.

472
00:38:14,497 --> 00:38:15,664
Anything else?

473
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:17,702
Why are you
making this so hard?

474
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:20,468
Do you really expect me
to make it easy?

475
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:26,274
Marian, you promised me
that you would wait for me.

476
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,710
They told me
you were dead.

477
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,245
Lord Loxley.

478
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:43,694
Lord Loxley.

479
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,794
Look, sorry,
I've got to go.

480
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,672
I don't trust
you around her.

481
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:56,006
What? I played my part.

482
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:58,742
If you need some motivation,
if she finds out what we're up to,

483
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:01,241
it's her head on the chopping
block, the same as ours.

484
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:03,379
Really inspiring.

485
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,410
Thanks.

486
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:14,525
Seems
Lord Loxley's inspired

487
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,989
an embarrassment
of riches today?

488
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,546
Shall I count to ten
before I raise the alarm?

489
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:43,816
Make it 20.

490
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,073
Who is it?

491
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,342
I don't know.

492
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:51,818
Sir. There's been
another robbery.

493
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:53,553
He's not gonna like that.

494
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:56,689
Sir, there's been
an occurrence,

495
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,858
which on first observation,

496
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:02,695
might be classified
as non-ideal, fiscally.

497
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:05,564
Oh, God,
give me strength.

498
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:12,071
Sir, sir, there's been
another minor incident.

499
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:16,074
The good news is neither of
the guards was badly killed.

500
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:17,143
What?

501
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:18,945
The collection box,

502
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:22,081
from right under our noses
at Sunday service.

503
00:41:22,111 --> 00:41:25,885
Oh, and the toll road last night,
so a bit of a pickle.

504
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:29,054
Pembroke! Get those
documents under lock and key.

505
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:31,056
Who else knows about this?

506
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:32,758
I came straight to you.

507
00:41:32,788 --> 00:41:35,928
But I suppose the archdeacon
should be told.

508
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,396
Shh. No, no, no, no, no.

509
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:39,165
We don't want him gossiping
to the cardinal.

510
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:40,665
But, sir,
surely the church...

511
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:42,067
It's a law and order issue.

512
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:43,735
I'm the law and order here.

513
00:41:43,765 --> 00:41:44,903
Tighten the security.

514
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:48,106
All tax collections now go
directly to the count room,

515
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:50,442
and double the guard
at the treasury.

516
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:51,542
As you say, sir.

517
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:54,412
I can't afford to lose
another penny.

518
00:41:54,442 --> 00:41:57,879
Sir, it's been a bit
since your last confession.

519
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:02,885
Would you care to unburden
yourself to your friar?

520
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:08,055
My conscience is clear.
Is yours?

521
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:12,997
Try as I might, mine's
always a bit of a muddle.

522
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:16,766
Well, be that as it may, keep your
ears open in your little booth.

523
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:19,036
Any talk of the thief,
bring it to me.

524
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:21,873
But, sir, with respect,
the Seal of the Confessional is sacred.

525
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:24,574
Nothing's sacred till
I've caught that thief

526
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:26,607
and drowned him in a cage.

527
00:42:34,948 --> 00:42:36,120
You're up late.

528
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,487
Just making my rounds,

529
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:40,824
found myself craving
a little sustenance.

530
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:43,894
I wanted to tell you that the
sheriff's coming down hard

531
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:45,962
in response
to the robberies.

532
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:48,161
It complicates our plans.

533
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:51,667
How are you getting on?

534
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:55,101
Best I can.
Had some help.

535
00:42:56,036 --> 00:42:57,938
Bag of coins
left at my door.

536
00:42:58,504 --> 00:42:59,505
By the Hood?

537
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:02,712
That's what
I call him now.

538
00:43:02,742 --> 00:43:05,915
It's got a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

539
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,846
Don't know why
he's giving the money to me.

540
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:09,952
Guess I'm flattered.

541
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:11,754
You should be.

542
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:14,586
But I wish he would
give it to the people instead.

543
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,890
Quick! Grab the money!

544
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:55,620
With respect, sheriff,

545
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,621
this thief is making you
look like a damn fool.

546
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,728
If I may...

547
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,103
I propose a bounty.

548
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:14,173
Surely you don't expect us
to finance it.

549
00:45:14,203 --> 00:45:16,774
No. I will
stake it personally.

550
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:19,310
Should we say a thousand
a week to begin with?

551
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,977
Then I'll double it every week,
thereafter, until he's either caught

552
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,849
or killed.

553
00:45:24,879 --> 00:45:26,848
Right. The rest of you, out.

554
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:33,321
Pembroke.

555
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,291
Out!

556
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:46,066
Those lords.

557
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:51,175
Days like this
that I just wanna

558
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:53,840
stick my thumb
into their windpipes.

559
00:45:54,807 --> 00:45:55,979
You really hate them.

560
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:58,982
Oh, well, you know, their daddies were

561
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:03,319
the Guardians of the Foundling House,
where I spent my youth.

562
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:08,024
And they would come around
at night to discipline us.

563
00:46:08,054 --> 00:46:11,761
With the archdeacon
and his clergy in tow.

564
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:13,197
And all of them drunk,

565
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:18,734
breath stinking of
boiled beef.

566
00:46:18,764 --> 00:46:21,137
And they would've
sent us out to buy

567
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:23,372
the canes which they
were gonna beat us with.

568
00:46:23,402 --> 00:46:26,343
You could tell how long the last beating
was because the color of the welts

569
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,344
would go from red
to blue, to yellow.

570
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:31,680
Finally, they would go to pink,
and the skin would harden.

571
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:35,852
And by that time, Loxley,
you had to make a choice.

572
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,920
You're gonna let them
beat the strength out of you

573
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,651
or they're gonna
beat it into you.

574
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:46,728
When they used the broomsticks
on the little boys,

575
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:50,795
and they would scream.

576
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:58,206
Then, they'd pour some brandy
down their throats as a mercy.

577
00:46:58,236 --> 00:47:01,740
Now, I never screamed, but...

578
00:47:02,973 --> 00:47:06,944
I hate the taste of brandy.

579
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:13,421
Shall we hang a few of them?
Those lords?

580
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:18,322
Just to see them
shit their silks?

581
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:24,432
Why don't we
just hang one of them?

582
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:28,263
'Cause I suspect the rest
would soon fall into line.

583
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:39,042
I am not after crumbs.

584
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:44,147
I want a seat
at the big table.

585
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,019
Well then,
you'll keep my favor, Loxley.

586
00:47:59,062 --> 00:48:00,631
It's Rob, right?

587
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,901
You're Will.

588
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:08,371
Welcome home.

589
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:11,444
Must've been hell
for you over there.

590
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:14,310
I fought the war,
I don't need to talk about it.

591
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:19,351
Look, I get it.
I really do.

592
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:22,522
It must be overwhelming
coming home, Marian...

593
00:48:22,552 --> 00:48:23,722
She's her own woman.

594
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:26,326
Well, that's right. So you
don't have to be okay with me.

595
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:27,489
Good. Because I'm not.

596
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:34,129
I heard you.

597
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:36,999
During the sheriff's speech.

598
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:38,933
Voice of the people.

599
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:42,441
They need one.

600
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:43,838
What about the Hood?

601
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:46,007
The Hood.

602
00:48:50,078 --> 00:48:51,212
He means nothing to me.

603
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:54,352
He'll be caught,
and forgotten.

604
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:56,954
And what I, Marian, and the rest
of the commoners are fighting for

605
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,056
is much bigger
than some petty thief

606
00:48:59,086 --> 00:49:00,988
turning over a few couriers
and collection boxes.

607
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:06,092
Still, I wouldn't
bet against him.

608
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:11,999
I reckon
he's just getting started.

609
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:19,272
John! I've had
a thought. Hear me out.

610
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,049
I wanna go big.

611
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,418
Forget couriers
and collection boxes.

612
00:49:28,448 --> 00:49:30,420
I wanna hit
the treasury itself.

613
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,521
Hard target.

614
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,120
Pull the tail,
see who bites!

615
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:37,424
How would you do it?

616
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:46,403
Easy, governor.

617
00:49:46,433 --> 00:49:48,438
- Move! Move!
- Help a hungry veteran.

618
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:50,040
Get out of the way.

619
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,407
Men, get this filth
out of the way!

620
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:52,941
Lost me hand in the war.

621
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:55,645
Be a pal
and spare some change.

622
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:59,176
God. This is a nice ass on this horse.
Please, sir.

623
00:50:01,113 --> 00:50:04,182
Get out of the way! Get out!

624
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:45,593
Change of protocol,
as per the sheriff.

625
00:50:45,623 --> 00:50:47,995
All collections are no longer
to be stored in the vault.

626
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:50,465
They go straight to the count room
for immediate processing.

627
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,495
Shit!

628
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:31,137
Guards! Guards!

629
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,968
Guards! Guards!

630
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,374
Shit! Shit!

631
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,448
Come on, come on!

632
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:33,318
Come on, come on! Come on!

633
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,326
There he is!

634
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:07,488
They're coming, John!

635
00:54:07,518 --> 00:54:09,453
Ye of little faith!

636
00:54:11,555 --> 00:54:13,157
Hyah.

637
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,597
Yeah!

638
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,636
It's the Hood!

639
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,371
That's how you go big!

640
00:54:24,401 --> 00:54:26,539
We didn't get a single coin!

641
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:28,207
We wanted
to get their attention.

642
00:54:28,237 --> 00:54:29,303
And we have it now.

643
00:55:09,277 --> 00:55:12,752
Our cardinal has asked me to
convey to you his disquiet,

644
00:55:12,782 --> 00:55:16,388
at your so-far defensive
response to this thief.

645
00:55:16,418 --> 00:55:18,624
It's nothing
I can't handle.

646
00:55:18,654 --> 00:55:21,860
You can tell His Eminence
he needn't lose any sleep.

647
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,630
Reassure him yourself in due time.
He's coming here.

648
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,331
From Rome?
Over a petty thief?

649
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:29,367
The church does not consider

650
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:32,303
the raiding
of its treasury petty.

651
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:35,374
Ah, he barely escaped,
and he got away with nothing.

652
00:55:35,404 --> 00:55:38,407
But what's dangerous is
the audacity of his crimes.

653
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,748
He's got our commoners
looking up, seeing hope.

654
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:47,585
We want their backs bent
and heads bowed.

655
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:49,885
There's been
whispers of revolt.

656
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:56,927
Unchecked, those whispers
will build into a roar.

657
00:55:56,957 --> 00:56:00,765
It's treason.
Punishable by death.

658
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:03,533
Treason's a very
strong word, sir.

659
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:07,772
Isn't the Christian thing
to turn the other cheek?

660
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:10,470
How do you love a God
that gives you that face?

661
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:20,947
Sheriff!

662
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:25,853
Given our shared interest
in the outcome of the war,

663
00:56:27,286 --> 00:56:30,990
it's essential this thief is caught
and his rhetoric suffocated.

664
00:56:34,794 --> 00:56:36,629
I'll restore the order.

665
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:43,669
You keep the faith,
Your Grace.

666
00:56:44,336 --> 00:56:48,343
Sheriff,
the church can make a man, or break him.

667
00:56:48,373 --> 00:56:50,579
For your allegiance,
we offer you the world.

668
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:52,676
But in failure,
we can also take it away.

669
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:59,451
Remember that. Hmm?

670
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,454
Let's make the cardinal
feel welcome, sheriff.

671
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:09,330
Ah!

672
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,602
If you ever defy me again
in front of the church...

673
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:17,872
I'm sorry, sir. I was only
speaking for the Gospels.

674
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:21,676
Oh, the Gospels. Well,
never, never forget, Tuck,

675
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:24,977
God's up there.
I'm down here.

676
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:31,486
Now, I've taken the measure
of hiring some special deputies.

677
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:34,555
Some of our most
trusted crusaders.

678
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,591
They're just back
from Arabia.

679
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:39,893
Here they are to receive
the archdeacon's blessing

680
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,363
before they begin
their good, good works.

681
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:44,464
Sheriff.

682
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:46,033
Commander Gisbourne.

683
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:50,637
They look very eager
to do God's work.

684
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:54,304
Yes. With the devil's pride.

685
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,506
One, two,
three, four, five.

686
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:02,049
We've done it!
We've done it.

687
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,583
The cardinal is coming
all the way from Rome.

688
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:07,486
The sheriff is throwing him a party,
and guess who's invited?

689
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:09,756
- It's my day off.
- No days off, English.

690
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,057
You'll rest when you're dead.

691
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,793
He's coming
because of the Hood.

692
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,460
Our plan is working!

693
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,762
That's very easy to say
from where you're standing.

694
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:20,000
The cardinal is one of the most
powerful people in the world.

695
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,804
Whatever he's come to tell
the sheriff, we must hear it.

696
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,404
I think what you mean
is I must hear it.

697
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:29,742
It will be
an orgy of excess.

698
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:31,677
A flamboyant
costume party,

699
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:34,743
the perfect place to put the
Loxley charm to the test.

700
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:39,614
We pulled the tail.
Now we see who bites.

701
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:52,393
Come, come, come in.
Or catch your death.

702
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:58,703
It's good you came.

703
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,940
I, uh, thought you might.

704
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,537
Will and I got an invite
to the cardinal's party.

705
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:05,844
Was that your doing?

706
00:59:05,874 --> 00:59:08,613
I may have put a word
into the sheriff's ear

707
00:59:08,643 --> 00:59:11,649
as to the
political astuteness

708
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,485
of tossing commoners a few
crumbs from the guest list.

709
00:59:15,515 --> 00:59:17,751
I may never get into
the palace again.

710
00:59:18,819 --> 00:59:20,121
This is our shot.

711
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:22,790
And we must take it.

712
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:24,762
And Will?

713
00:59:24,792 --> 00:59:25,860
He can't know
what we're doing.

714
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:29,566
He wouldn't approve.

715
00:59:29,596 --> 00:59:31,498
Rob will be there, surely.

716
00:59:36,803 --> 00:59:37,708
And?

717
00:59:37,738 --> 00:59:40,811
Marian, what we are
doing is very dangerous.

718
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:45,148
We cannot risk letting our
emotions compromise it.

719
00:59:45,178 --> 00:59:47,147
- You and Rob...
- Tuck, I know.

720
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:49,750
You sure
you're up for this?

721
00:59:51,918 --> 00:59:53,150
No.

722
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:13,039
Here,
you're Lord Loxley.

723
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:14,976
Play your part.

724
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:16,878
Drink. Don't get drunk.

725
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:18,147
Killjoy.

726
01:00:18,177 --> 01:00:21,717
But above all, you must get
an audience with the cardinal.

727
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,553
John. I've got this.

728
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,183
I was born to be here.
Remember?

729
01:00:31,957 --> 01:00:33,458
Wow!

730
01:00:35,161 --> 01:00:37,964
Lord Loxley. Hmm?

731
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:39,931
Ah...

732
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:45,573
Nothing more than just
a lapdog to the rich.

733
01:00:45,603 --> 01:00:48,643
So did you run out
of prisoners to execute in the desert?

734
01:00:48,673 --> 01:00:50,110
No.

735
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,713
Got old and boring.

736
01:00:52,743 --> 01:00:58,482
My new employer has me
hunting more elusive prey now.

737
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:11,161
Enjoy the party.

738
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,256
Come on, seven!

739
01:01:43,226 --> 01:01:45,264
Stealing from
the rich to give to the poor?

740
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:48,134
He's taking the piss out
of the whole damn natural order.

741
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:49,068
Oh, you flatter him.

742
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:51,703
He's a smash and grabber,
nothing more.

743
01:01:51,733 --> 01:01:53,967
And hideously ugly,
hence that ridiculous hood.

744
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:58,207
I wonder
if he isn't a veteran.

745
01:01:59,242 --> 01:02:00,542
Huh?

746
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:03,915
Of the Crusades?

747
01:02:03,945 --> 01:02:07,749
Clearly, he's well-trained.
He's audacious.

748
01:02:08,317 --> 01:02:10,919
Adaptable under fire.

749
01:02:11,787 --> 01:02:12,991
Hmm.

750
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,892
Living on luck there, sir.

751
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:16,061
You'll get him eventually.

752
01:02:16,091 --> 01:02:19,828
The elites shouldn't be surprised
by the thief's revolution.

753
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,265
You created
the conditions for it.

754
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:25,100
Marian.

755
01:02:27,868 --> 01:02:30,107
Your beauty
leaves me speechless.

756
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:31,809
Sheriff, I take it
you know Marian.

757
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:36,278
Oh, yes. The sweet scourge
of many a town hall speech.

758
01:02:37,678 --> 01:02:38,946
So, Marian.

759
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,615
Who do you think
the thief is?

760
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,951
He's all of us.

761
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:45,890
That's what counts.

762
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,925
Ah...

763
01:02:47,955 --> 01:02:49,989
So you're an admirer.

764
01:02:51,825 --> 01:02:53,964
He has his qualities.

765
01:02:53,994 --> 01:02:56,133
Marian, there you are.

766
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:57,898
Shouldn't wander off
too far, my love.

767
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,676
We appreciate you having us here, sir.
We really do.

768
01:03:06,706 --> 01:03:07,811
I have ambitions.

769
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:11,415
And we both know the poor
need strong leaders. Like us.

770
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:12,682
Indeed.

771
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:15,985
Or else they get seduced
by criminals like the Hood.

772
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:17,220
Oh.

773
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,721
- Bloody hell!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, my Lord!

774
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:19,689
What have I done there?

775
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:21,658
I've got juice all over
your thing there.

776
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:23,126
- Let me wipe...
- Get off me!

777
01:03:23,156 --> 01:03:24,727
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
- Get off!

778
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,161
- Tuck!
- Yes, sir?

779
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:28,130
- You're an idiot.
- My apologies.

780
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,999
Apologies. Halt and lame.
That's me, sir.

781
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:32,901
Halt and lame.

782
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:34,770
I have no doubt
you'll have the Hood.

783
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,635
Takes a thief
to catch a thief.

784
01:05:12,828 --> 01:05:14,200
Your Eminence.

785
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,432
Get off your knees.
Time is short.

786
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:31,313
Hood's robberies
threaten our plans for the war.

787
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:34,917
You want my reassurance?

788
01:05:41,423 --> 01:05:42,857
You are afraid.

789
01:05:44,926 --> 01:05:46,262
You should be.

790
01:05:47,095 --> 01:05:48,100
Do you know why?

791
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:51,970
Why don't you enlighten
me, Your Eminence?

792
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,372
Fear is the greatest weapon
in God's arsenal.

793
01:06:01,577 --> 01:06:04,177
It is why
the church created hell.

794
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:17,324
Robin.

795
01:06:19,259 --> 01:06:20,831
Tuck!

796
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:23,834
How long have
you known me?

797
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:25,236
Since you were a boy.

798
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:26,503
And you trust me?

799
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:27,837
With my life.

800
01:06:27,867 --> 01:06:28,868
Excellent.

801
01:06:31,004 --> 01:06:33,440
This piece of scum
is a thief!

802
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:35,946
He stole
Lord Pembroke's keys.

803
01:06:35,976 --> 01:06:38,147
I don't know
what he's talking about.

804
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:40,484
You can search me.
I don't have any keys.

805
01:06:40,514 --> 01:06:42,151
Loxley's right.
They're gone.

806
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:43,353
Oh.

807
01:06:43,383 --> 01:06:47,057
Take a guard, find the key,
check every room they open.

808
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,191
You, come with me.

809
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,925
Explain yourself, Friar.

810
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:51,294
I didn't steal anything.

811
01:06:51,324 --> 01:06:53,826
Well, then you must
know who did. Huh?

812
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,594
Confess!

813
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:00,500
Just kill him.

814
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:07,073
Wait!

815
01:07:23,955 --> 01:07:25,889
The commoners
love this worm.

816
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,297
And I think
he wants to die.

817
01:07:29,327 --> 01:07:31,966
I think he wants
to be their martyr.

818
01:07:31,996 --> 01:07:34,936
So let's give him a fate
worse than death.

819
01:07:34,966 --> 01:07:36,368
Revoke his church.

820
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:40,307
Defrock him!

821
01:07:40,337 --> 01:07:42,076
And throw him
to the streets.

822
01:07:42,106 --> 01:07:45,146
That should cut him a little
deeper than any blade could.

823
01:07:45,176 --> 01:07:47,515
Don't! You can't!
Your Grace, please!

824
01:07:47,545 --> 01:07:49,150
Oh, I can and I do.

825
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:52,086
For the crime of falsehood
under canon law,

826
01:07:52,116 --> 01:07:55,317
get this disgrace
out of my sight!

827
01:08:06,296 --> 01:08:08,102
Who is this young man?

828
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:10,567
This is
Robin of Loxley.

829
01:08:12,369 --> 01:08:14,504
- And I trust him.
- Hmm.

830
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,513
You are the grace and good work
of the Lord made flesh, Your Eminence.

831
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,285
Good.

832
01:08:25,315 --> 01:08:29,422
The young are God's gift
to the church.

833
01:08:29,452 --> 01:08:31,154
The arrows in our quiver.

834
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:36,993
No, no, stay.

835
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,270
Welcome to
the big table, Loxley.

836
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,672
Now whatever
this Hood has done...

837
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:48,174
I will have him.

838
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:49,205
Silence!

839
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:56,982
If we are to continue funding the Arabs
and defeat the English army

840
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,383
so that you and I can take
control from the king,

841
01:09:01,484 --> 01:09:03,155
the money we owe them

842
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:06,591
must sail in four days.
Do that

843
01:09:06,621 --> 01:09:11,293
and we will have bought
absolute power.

844
01:09:13,462 --> 01:09:16,501
And if I need more time
to raise the money?

845
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:19,033
You had your time, sheriff.

846
01:09:20,769 --> 01:09:23,605
Satisfy me that you can
do what must be done!

847
01:09:27,475 --> 01:09:30,281
You want to see fear?

848
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:34,285
I'll send my men
to raid the mines tonight.

849
01:09:34,315 --> 01:09:35,484
Now,

850
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:38,322
when that's done,

851
01:09:38,352 --> 01:09:42,326
I'll take the commoners
for everything they've got,

852
01:09:42,356 --> 01:09:45,196
from their pisspots
to their pocket coins.

853
01:09:45,226 --> 01:09:46,797
And when that is done,

854
01:09:46,827 --> 01:09:52,068
I will burn their
shit slums to the ground.

855
01:09:52,098 --> 01:09:55,769
Just to remind them they're not
the people, they're my subjects.

856
01:09:58,606 --> 01:10:01,375
Will that
satisfy you, priest?

857
01:10:05,178 --> 01:10:08,147
Go with God, sheriff.

858
01:10:10,818 --> 01:10:12,121
Talk to me.

859
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:14,089
We've got to get
to the mines.

860
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:15,187
Now.

861
01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:34,644
Let's start with
where did you even get this?

862
01:10:34,674 --> 01:10:35,745
That doesn't matter.

863
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,413
Oh, it matters, Marian.

864
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:40,349
This is in Arabic
with the sheriff's signature underneath.

865
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:41,617
Which could mean anything.

866
01:10:41,647 --> 01:10:42,684
Or nothing.

867
01:10:42,714 --> 01:10:45,320
What is plain is that
however you came by these,

868
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,286
it wasn't honestly.

869
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:50,091
Don't do that.

870
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:51,459
What? I'm talking to you.

871
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:53,127
Like a child!

872
01:10:53,157 --> 01:10:55,631
Don't handle me.

873
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:57,566
Okay, I'm gonna
take these to the sheriff

874
01:10:57,596 --> 01:10:58,830
to give him a chance
to explain for himself.

875
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:00,532
I'll take them.

876
01:11:01,732 --> 01:11:03,571
To someone
I know I can trust.

877
01:11:03,601 --> 01:11:06,370
When did I lose your trust?

878
01:11:07,572 --> 01:11:09,811
Your way.

879
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:13,477
All your politics.
It's not changing anything.

880
01:11:14,277 --> 01:11:15,846
Please see that.

881
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:19,620
Have you even spared a second
to think about what you could cost me?

882
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,789
This could ruin
my political future.

883
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,858
Will! I'm talking
about action.

884
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:26,493
I have worked too hard
for too long,

885
01:11:26,523 --> 01:11:28,391
Devil knows, for years.

886
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:34,602
Swallowing the lords' insults,
them laughing behind my back,

887
01:11:34,632 --> 01:11:36,904
so that I can pull myself
up from the gutter

888
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:39,639
and get the life I deserve.

889
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:42,342
And no one is gonna
bollocks me on this.

890
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:43,773
Not even you.

891
01:11:45,508 --> 01:11:47,147
You're scared.

892
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:48,381
What?

893
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:50,647
You think that
if the commoners do rise up,

894
01:11:51,948 --> 01:11:55,752
if they fight, you'll lose them.

895
01:11:57,621 --> 01:11:59,426
They'll follow the Hood.

896
01:11:59,456 --> 01:12:00,590
All right, men!

897
01:12:01,457 --> 01:12:03,125
You know what to do.

898
01:12:05,361 --> 01:12:06,662
Move!

899
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,719
As of right now

900
01:12:26,749 --> 01:12:30,823
these mines are declared
part of Nottingham.

901
01:12:30,853 --> 01:12:32,658
On whose authority?

902
01:12:32,688 --> 01:12:35,961
Everybody
will pay what they owe

903
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:37,525
for the war effort.

904
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:45,199
Refusal will be counted
as treason.

905
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:51,441
No! Please!
No, no! Please!

906
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:52,473
I've done nothing wrong!

907
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,741
Mercy!

908
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:01,852
Penny!

909
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:02,883
Stay back!

910
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:12,894
Call yourself a man?

911
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:20,667
Oh, I'm gonna
have fun with you later.

912
01:13:26,372 --> 01:13:28,344
We're too late.
There are too many of them.

913
01:13:28,374 --> 01:13:29,375
What? For you and me?

914
01:13:30,276 --> 01:13:31,910
There's not enough.

915
01:13:35,782 --> 01:13:37,020
They've got Marian!

916
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,751
No!

917
01:13:41,454 --> 01:13:42,658
Let me out!

918
01:13:42,688 --> 01:13:44,223
Let me out!

919
01:13:45,524 --> 01:13:47,463
Let me out!

920
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:48,598
You take the front,
I've got the back.

921
01:13:48,628 --> 01:13:49,795
Wait. How you gonna...

922
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:53,365
Oh, that is clever.

923
01:14:01,007 --> 01:14:02,875
Hyah. Hyah.

924
01:14:04,743 --> 01:14:05,945
Hyah.

925
01:14:07,646 --> 01:14:08,751
There's the one I want.

926
01:14:08,781 --> 01:14:10,753
It's Gisbourne!
Turn! Turn!

927
01:14:10,783 --> 01:14:11,821
Ah! Hold on!

928
01:14:11,851 --> 01:14:12,852
Move!

929
01:14:14,085 --> 01:14:15,286
Hyah!

930
01:14:17,622 --> 01:14:19,324
I want him alive!

931
01:14:20,059 --> 01:14:21,326
Hyah.

932
01:14:26,597 --> 01:14:27,766
Hyah.

933
01:14:28,633 --> 01:14:29,634
Hold on!

934
01:14:32,937 --> 01:14:34,506
Let me out!

935
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:40,444
Hyah.

936
01:14:42,814 --> 01:14:43,915
Hyah.

937
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,460
Get me out!

938
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:54,892
- Get me out of here!
- Keep it steady!

939
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:58,662
John, keep it steady!

940
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:05,739
Rob!

941
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:06,874
How did you know it was me?

942
01:15:06,904 --> 01:15:08,942
You call that a disguise?

943
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:10,874
Well, it fooled
everybody else.

944
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,678
- I'm not everyone else!
- Watch out!

945
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,852
Why didn't you tell me?

946
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,889
Are we really
going to do this now?

947
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:23,020
Get down!

948
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:27,527
We've got trouble!

949
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:28,925
After them!

950
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,665
Hold it!

951
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:51,513
Hyah.

952
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:44,164
Follow me!

953
01:16:51,938 --> 01:16:53,506
There he is!

954
01:16:58,913 --> 01:16:59,914
Go slow!

955
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:44,522
Hyah.

956
01:17:54,865 --> 01:17:56,534
Shoot his horse!

957
01:18:26,596 --> 01:18:28,098
Jump!

958
01:18:41,711 --> 01:18:42,849
Are you okay?
Marian?

959
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:43,880
Yeah.

960
01:18:48,651 --> 01:18:51,590
You and Marian.
Finish it.

961
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:53,692
No, John! Wait!

962
01:18:53,722 --> 01:18:55,561
- Go! Get out of here!
- John, wait!

963
01:18:55,591 --> 01:18:57,293
- We have to go! Now!
- No, John, wait, John!

964
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:02,898
- John, no!
- We have to go now!

965
01:19:30,691 --> 01:19:32,197
You okay?

966
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:33,698
I'm done.

967
01:19:33,728 --> 01:19:35,633
We're finished.

968
01:19:35,663 --> 01:19:36,932
No.

969
01:19:38,766 --> 01:19:40,838
It's not lost unless
you walk away now.

970
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:43,941
It's all John. He's the one
who dragged me into this.

971
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:45,743
He chose you for a reason.

972
01:19:45,773 --> 01:19:47,178
- What reason?
- Find him.

973
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,979
I want him alive!

974
01:19:49,009 --> 01:19:51,982
All I wanted
was to get you back.

975
01:19:52,012 --> 01:19:55,283
Maybe that's how it started,
but it's bigger than that now.

976
01:19:57,318 --> 01:19:59,120
I'm not who you think I am.

977
01:20:00,822 --> 01:20:02,856
The Hood's just a disguise.

978
01:20:04,124 --> 01:20:05,625
I know you.

979
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,830
Loxley is the disguise.

980
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:20,944
In the mines, there's a
thing called a firedamp,

981
01:20:20,974 --> 01:20:24,010
when a single spark
sets the air on fire.

982
01:20:27,247 --> 01:20:29,316
That's what you are
for the people.

983
01:20:31,318 --> 01:20:32,989
Me?

984
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:36,689
If not you, who?

985
01:20:39,825 --> 01:20:41,994
If not now, when?

986
01:20:45,197 --> 01:20:47,237
The sheriff,
he and the cardinal,

987
01:20:47,267 --> 01:20:48,838
they're in league
with the Arabians somehow.

988
01:20:48,868 --> 01:20:50,336
Yeah. I might have proof.

989
01:20:53,072 --> 01:20:54,243
If the people knew...

990
01:20:54,273 --> 01:20:55,673
If the people knew,
they'd fight.

991
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:01,846
With the right leader.

992
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:19,197
If you want me
to give up the thief,

993
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,440
at least give me
the respect and try

994
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,237
and beat it out of me.

995
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:29,110
No.

996
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:31,909
You'd just die on me
out of spite.

997
01:21:34,212 --> 01:21:37,251
Humans are the only species
that fear death.

998
01:21:37,281 --> 01:21:41,822
Not just the threat of it,
but its finality.

999
01:21:41,852 --> 01:21:47,127
That's what separates us from
the insects and the dogs.

1000
01:21:47,157 --> 01:21:49,997
The Arab, however,
doesn't fear death at all

1001
01:21:50,027 --> 01:21:55,035
because your false prophet
promised you the garden.

1002
01:21:55,065 --> 01:21:57,905
A man without faith.

1003
01:21:57,935 --> 01:21:59,039
Lonely.

1004
01:21:59,069 --> 01:22:00,907
Liberating.

1005
01:22:00,937 --> 01:22:03,839
Without judgment, no sin.

1006
01:22:04,541 --> 01:22:05,942
Faith.

1007
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:10,414
We stare death in the face
with courage and honor.

1008
01:22:11,215 --> 01:22:12,752
Really?

1009
01:22:12,782 --> 01:22:14,954
Because I was told

1010
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:17,787
that your boy begged

1011
01:22:19,222 --> 01:22:22,396
for his life right up until the moment

1012
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:25,060
that we took his head
from his neck.

1013
01:22:25,894 --> 01:22:29,202
Decapitation's a funny thing

1014
01:22:29,232 --> 01:22:33,406
because the eyes keep seeing.

1015
01:22:33,436 --> 01:22:37,275
The mind goes on
trying to deny death.

1016
01:22:37,305 --> 01:22:39,878
Even if it's just
for a few more moments.

1017
01:22:39,908 --> 01:22:43,215
But I wonder what your
son might have been

1018
01:22:43,245 --> 01:22:45,050
thinking in those
final seconds.

1019
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,054
I imagine it to be
something like, "Father.

1020
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:50,155
"Why have you
brought me to this place?

1021
01:22:50,185 --> 01:22:51,289
"Father, I'm scared.

1022
01:22:51,319 --> 01:22:53,486
"Father, why
don't you save me?"

1023
01:22:57,525 --> 01:23:00,332
If you don't give me
the thief's name,

1024
01:23:00,362 --> 01:23:03,535
I will gorge you
with pig's blood

1025
01:23:03,565 --> 01:23:05,403
and I will burn you

1026
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:09,207
and you will
never see paradise.

1027
01:23:09,237 --> 01:23:13,544
But if you do give me his name,
I'll martyr you quickly, cleanly.

1028
01:23:13,574 --> 01:23:14,908
You will join your boy.

1029
01:23:17,945 --> 01:23:18,946
Sheriff!

1030
01:23:20,214 --> 01:23:22,920
Oh, I'm glad
your faith is so strong.

1031
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:26,823
It's gonna make breaking it
so much sweeter.

1032
01:23:26,853 --> 01:23:28,525
I'm a killer.

1033
01:23:28,555 --> 01:23:32,062
I was born into this war.

1034
01:23:32,092 --> 01:23:34,064
But I've never met a man
who had his killing

1035
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:37,333
coming as much as you do.

1036
01:23:37,363 --> 01:23:39,302
You're gonna wanna
believe in a god.

1037
01:23:39,332 --> 01:23:41,104
You're gonna
want to see His face

1038
01:23:41,134 --> 01:23:43,973
and think that something
can save you.

1039
01:23:44,003 --> 01:23:46,110
But you'll see my face.

1040
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,309
And that's
the last thing you'll see.

1041
01:24:08,661 --> 01:24:10,096
Will.

1042
01:24:11,564 --> 01:24:13,068
Mr. Tillman.
Everyone's ready.

1043
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:14,970
Thanks, Penny.

1044
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,071
What's happening?

1045
01:24:16,101 --> 01:24:17,502
We're leaving the mines.

1046
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,911
What happened last night
will happen again and again,

1047
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:24,280
they will keep on coming.

1048
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:25,414
I know these people.

1049
01:24:25,444 --> 01:24:28,650
Let 'em come back and kill
us all, I am not running!

1050
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,386
Listen, I hear you, but we
cannot plan when we panic.

1051
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:32,554
She's right, Will.

1052
01:24:32,584 --> 01:24:34,056
We should stay and fight.

1053
01:24:34,086 --> 01:24:35,253
With what?

1054
01:24:35,954 --> 01:24:37,526
Picks and shovels?

1055
01:24:37,556 --> 01:24:40,895
The city is in lockdown.
It is martial law.

1056
01:24:40,925 --> 01:24:44,965
Look, we can die as prisoners
or we can fall back and live.

1057
01:24:44,995 --> 01:24:47,163
You've got
another choice.

1058
01:24:51,202 --> 01:24:53,207
We can make
our own choices.

1059
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:55,142
All your thievery has done

1060
01:24:55,172 --> 01:24:58,279
is drive the sheriff
to declare war on us.

1061
01:24:58,309 --> 01:25:00,449
You have no voice here.

1062
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:02,313
Then
I'll show you my face.

1063
01:25:14,524 --> 01:25:17,263
Are we supposed
to be impressed?

1064
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:20,534
The good Lord of Loxley
has come down from on high

1065
01:25:20,564 --> 01:25:23,471
to tell us, the peasants,
what to do?

1066
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:24,572
Well, let me
tell you something.

1067
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:25,672
This is not your manor.

1068
01:25:25,702 --> 01:25:26,902
Let him talk.

1069
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:40,119
Four years ago,

1070
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:43,919
I marched off to fight
for a liar's cause.

1071
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:50,592
Left my heart,
came home an heir to nothing.

1072
01:25:52,161 --> 01:25:53,065
The question is

1073
01:25:53,095 --> 01:25:56,669
what would you do
to get back what's yours?

1074
01:25:56,699 --> 01:26:00,435
I'm guessing you'd be up for
a little redistribution of wealth?

1075
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:04,543
Well, the sheriff has already
rinsed us for everything we have.

1076
01:26:04,573 --> 01:26:07,980
The sheriff and the cardinal are
plotting against England with the enemy.

1077
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:10,616
Now, I don't know what their scheme is,
but I'm willing to bet that

1078
01:26:10,646 --> 01:26:12,651
it's your money
bankrolling it.

1079
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:15,554
Money which is due
to set sail to Arabia

1080
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:17,556
in three days.

1081
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:19,653
But not if we stop them.

1082
01:26:26,594 --> 01:26:29,735
Some say I rob from the
rich and give to the poor.

1083
01:26:29,765 --> 01:26:34,005
But if the rich are stealing from you,
who's really the thief?

1084
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:37,107
I was Robin of Loxley,

1085
01:26:37,137 --> 01:26:40,545
a Crusader under the flag
of the King of England.

1086
01:26:40,575 --> 01:26:42,276
Then I was the Hood.

1087
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:48,752
Now, I really don't care
what you call me, thief or lord.

1088
01:26:48,782 --> 01:26:51,652
All I know is I'm nothing
without your help.

1089
01:26:53,286 --> 01:26:55,660
This is our crusade!

1090
01:26:55,690 --> 01:26:58,663
And each and every one of us
has to stand up

1091
01:26:58,693 --> 01:27:01,294
or we all go under.

1092
01:27:05,532 --> 01:27:07,133
I say we go with him!

1093
01:27:12,072 --> 01:27:14,541
Look, people,
listen. People!

1094
01:27:16,141 --> 01:27:18,548
We need to be
thinking practically.

1095
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:21,685
Where are we going to eat?
How can we find shelter?

1096
01:27:21,715 --> 01:27:23,383
I couldn't say this
to you before,

1097
01:27:24,683 --> 01:27:26,188
but I know what you've
done for these people.

1098
01:27:26,218 --> 01:27:27,553
I know why
they look up to you.

1099
01:27:28,254 --> 01:27:31,625
What happens next
doesn't happen at all without you, Will.

1100
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:55,384
Tuck! Back at the party,

1101
01:27:55,414 --> 01:27:58,287
I couldn't think of another way
to get you out of there. I'm sorry.

1102
01:27:58,317 --> 01:27:59,355
Don't be.

1103
01:27:59,385 --> 01:28:02,320
Tuck! I got you defrocked.

1104
01:28:03,288 --> 01:28:04,789
Yes, you did.

1105
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:07,529
You set me free.

1106
01:28:07,559 --> 01:28:11,329
Now, come, come. We have
the devil's work to undo.

1107
01:28:13,463 --> 01:28:17,204
10,000 gold nobles
paid to an Arabic general

1108
01:28:17,234 --> 01:28:19,607
authorized by
the Sheriff of Nottingham...

1109
01:28:19,637 --> 01:28:24,345
20,000, 40... These payments
go back years and years.

1110
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:26,547
And if they get that
money, we're all finished.

1111
01:28:26,577 --> 01:28:27,744
Not if we stop them.

1112
01:28:30,447 --> 01:28:33,718
Here it was me thinking
you were just the humble friar, Tuck.

1113
01:28:34,419 --> 01:28:35,823
Yeah, well...

1114
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:36,924
After the money
leaves the treasury,

1115
01:28:36,954 --> 01:28:39,426
it's going to stop at
the cathedral to be blessed

1116
01:28:39,456 --> 01:28:41,628
before it's handed over
to the cardinal's men.

1117
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:43,330
Well, then,
that's where we hit it.

1118
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,465
The sheriff will have all
his Crossmen on that convoy.

1119
01:28:45,495 --> 01:28:47,301
A legion of them, no doubt.

1120
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:50,737
Elite killers armed to the teeth,
and the city streets on lockdown,

1121
01:28:50,767 --> 01:28:52,873
so you can forget about
the element of surprise.

1122
01:28:52,903 --> 01:28:55,409
We'll be lambs
to the slaughter. This is...

1123
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:58,278
Suicide, yeah, we get it.

1124
01:28:58,308 --> 01:29:01,243
What do you say to that,
then, soldier?

1125
01:29:03,312 --> 01:29:05,786
Set up a meeting
at Loxley Manor.

1126
01:29:05,816 --> 01:29:07,249
Everyone who's with us.

1127
01:29:12,288 --> 01:29:13,388
Rob.

1128
01:29:13,956 --> 01:29:15,491
Everyone's here.

1129
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:34,342
Here's the plan.

1130
01:29:53,327 --> 01:29:54,729
Three more
on that side!

1131
01:29:57,465 --> 01:29:59,699
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Careful with it.

1132
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:04,736
One more hood. Hood.

1133
01:30:06,507 --> 01:30:07,946
- Two hoods coming up.
- Here!

1134
01:30:07,976 --> 01:30:09,510
Who else needs a hood?

1135
01:30:20,487 --> 01:30:24,594
As long as he is uncaught,
my money's not safe!

1136
01:30:24,624 --> 01:30:26,864
Now did you leave your balls

1137
01:30:26,894 --> 01:30:29,833
for this kind of work
in the desert, did you?

1138
01:30:29,863 --> 01:30:34,672
I want his blood flooding
the streets of Nottingham...

1139
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:37,540
I want the rats
swimming in it.

1140
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:41,778
I want the dogs licking it
from the streets.

1141
01:30:41,808 --> 01:30:45,344
My life rides on that wagon.

1142
01:32:26,843 --> 01:32:27,911
Ready for this, Will?

1143
01:32:32,148 --> 01:32:35,655
A thousand pounds for
the man who brings me Hood!

1144
01:32:35,685 --> 01:32:38,988
One of these bastards
knows who he is!

1145
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:50,331
This is it!

1146
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:33,541
Throw it, Will!

1147
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:36,977
Throw it!

1148
01:34:12,478 --> 01:34:13,512
Where is he?

1149
01:34:15,048 --> 01:34:16,582
Where is the Hood?

1150
01:34:32,731 --> 01:34:34,767
Get me through
that goddamned fire!

1151
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:47,850
Was that supposed
to happen?

1152
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,617
Yeah, of course.

1153
01:34:49,647 --> 01:34:51,616
You, form up!

1154
01:35:22,546 --> 01:35:25,115
They're
taking my money!

1155
01:35:28,218 --> 01:35:29,686
- Kill them!
- Marian!

1156
01:35:39,562 --> 01:35:40,563
Look away.

1157
01:35:41,597 --> 01:35:42,632
Never.

1158
01:36:04,787 --> 01:36:06,092
Get down there!

1159
01:36:06,122 --> 01:36:07,287
Get down there now!

1160
01:36:09,259 --> 01:36:11,825
Gisbourne. Down there!

1161
01:36:26,775 --> 01:36:28,710
Lord Loxley.

1162
01:36:49,163 --> 01:36:50,831
We don't have to do this.

1163
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:55,672
- Kill me. Kill me, Loxley.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

1164
01:36:55,702 --> 01:36:57,108
You saved my life
back in the desert.

1165
01:36:57,138 --> 01:36:58,276
I'm not gonna
take yours now.

1166
01:36:58,306 --> 01:37:00,878
I am God's true soldier,
Loxley.

1167
01:37:00,908 --> 01:37:02,643
I deserve a...

1168
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:07,315
He had it coming.

1169
01:37:14,888 --> 01:37:16,692
- Give me a hand there.
- Get it to the forest.

1170
01:37:16,722 --> 01:37:17,728
- Be safe.
- Aye.

1171
01:37:17,758 --> 01:37:20,998
Go, guys! Move, move, move!
Come on! Let's go!

1172
01:37:21,028 --> 01:37:22,733
Where's Will?
He should be here by now.

1173
01:37:22,763 --> 01:37:24,801
He knows the plan.
We need to go.

1174
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:26,769
I'm going back for him.
You go with them.

1175
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,838
You're the most wanted man
in Nottingham.

1176
01:37:28,868 --> 01:37:30,706
Going back is suicide.

1177
01:37:30,736 --> 01:37:32,638
Either we all make it
or none of us do.

1178
01:37:48,254 --> 01:37:49,691
Tuck! Tuck!

1179
01:37:49,721 --> 01:37:50,892
Tuck,
have you seen Will?

1180
01:37:50,922 --> 01:37:52,694
He was meant to be
on the boat with you.

1181
01:37:52,724 --> 01:37:54,127
Will!

1182
01:37:56,929 --> 01:37:57,997
Will!

1183
01:37:58,865 --> 01:37:59,968
It's okay.

1184
01:37:59,998 --> 01:38:00,999
I know!

1185
01:38:03,802 --> 01:38:05,371
I saw!

1186
01:38:06,037 --> 01:38:07,373
He can have you.

1187
01:38:08,773 --> 01:38:10,041
Get out of my sight!

1188
01:38:10,942 --> 01:38:11,942
Go!

1189
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:15,817
I'll get him
back to the manor.

1190
01:38:15,847 --> 01:38:16,918
Get everyone
out of here.

1191
01:38:16,948 --> 01:38:18,817
- What about you?
- Just go!

1192
01:38:41,872 --> 01:38:42,873
Rob!

1193
01:38:48,778 --> 01:38:51,986
Stop! Stop fighting!

1194
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:54,751
The man you're
hunting for is me!

1195
01:38:55,186 --> 01:38:56,991
No more running.

1196
01:38:57,021 --> 01:38:58,359
No more hiding.

1197
01:38:58,389 --> 01:39:02,195
And if sacrificing myself
stops this madness,

1198
01:39:02,225 --> 01:39:03,693
here I am!

1199
01:39:04,827 --> 01:39:05,828
Get off me!

1200
01:39:16,539 --> 01:39:18,344
My city
is under siege.

1201
01:39:18,374 --> 01:39:22,176
Is there literally nothing
else you could be doing?

1202
01:39:35,425 --> 01:39:37,726
Loxley.

1203
01:39:42,998 --> 01:39:46,239
You've put me
to a lot of trouble, boy.

1204
01:39:46,269 --> 01:39:49,441
Oh, your troubles have
only just begun, sheriff!

1205
01:39:49,471 --> 01:39:53,442
Everyone will know of your
treason and the cardinal's.

1206
01:39:54,977 --> 01:39:59,014
What do you think the crown will do
when it finds out you're a traitor?

1207
01:39:59,381 --> 01:40:01,285
Huh?

1208
01:40:01,315 --> 01:40:03,751
Do you think they'll
just take off your head?

1209
01:40:05,254 --> 01:40:07,855
Or will they give you
the broomstick first?

1210
01:40:27,408 --> 01:40:30,214
Now I'm going to boil you
in your own piss,

1211
01:40:30,244 --> 01:40:33,117
and then I'm going
to send Marian off

1212
01:40:33,147 --> 01:40:35,486
to be bred
by savages in Arabia

1213
01:40:35,516 --> 01:40:38,584
again, and again, and again.

1214
01:40:47,926 --> 01:40:49,865
Look at me!
Look in my eyes!

1215
01:40:49,895 --> 01:40:51,101
Please, God.

1216
01:40:51,131 --> 01:40:53,533
God isn't here,
it's just me!

1217
01:41:04,943 --> 01:41:07,514
You bastard,
I'm the Sheriff of Nottingham!

1218
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:09,316
Not anymore.

1219
01:41:20,427 --> 01:41:22,595
You are a hard man
to kill, John.

1220
01:41:23,961 --> 01:41:25,963
And I thank God for it.

1221
01:41:32,571 --> 01:41:34,977
Daylight. Daylight ahead.

1222
01:41:35,007 --> 01:41:36,377
Okay, everybody...

1223
01:41:36,407 --> 01:41:39,280
I know you're tired,
but let's keep moving...

1224
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:41,517
I wanna get us
under cover by nightfall.

1225
01:41:41,547 --> 01:41:43,519
I'll see you in Sherwood.

1226
01:41:43,549 --> 01:41:45,521
I'll see you there.

1227
01:41:45,551 --> 01:41:49,090
And this does make us outlaws,
so if anybody wants out,

1228
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,392
well, it's probably too late.

1229
01:41:51,422 --> 01:41:52,994
Here, let me
help you with that.

1230
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,195
Get going.

1231
01:41:54,225 --> 01:41:59,033
I'm actually quite giddy
to find myself an outlaw.

1232
01:41:59,063 --> 01:42:02,437
It's the most exciting thing
that's happened to me since,

1233
01:42:02,467 --> 01:42:05,473
well, come
to think of it, ever.

1234
01:42:05,503 --> 01:42:10,011
You know, when I was
back in the desert,

1235
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:13,146
all I thought about was coming
back here and being with you.

1236
01:42:13,176 --> 01:42:14,981
Sitting in our manor,

1237
01:42:15,011 --> 01:42:18,248
eating and drinking
and not doing very much.

1238
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:23,653
And now we're fugitives,
and me the leader of a revolution.

1239
01:42:25,589 --> 01:42:27,090
Didn't see it coming.

1240
01:42:28,425 --> 01:42:29,459
I did.

1241
01:42:34,564 --> 01:42:36,369
It's a nice forest.

1242
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:39,138
We haven't officially met.
I'm Tuck, by the way.

1243
01:42:39,168 --> 01:42:41,541
Yahya ibn Umar.

1244
01:42:41,571 --> 01:42:42,975
Phew.

1245
01:42:43,005 --> 01:42:44,578
Would you mind
if I just translate it?

1246
01:42:44,608 --> 01:42:46,243
Call you John?

1247
01:42:48,577 --> 01:42:50,579
Feels like
a perfect ending, doesn't it?

1248
01:42:51,313 --> 01:42:52,581
But it's not.

1249
01:42:53,516 --> 01:42:56,122
Fate plays its part.

1250
01:42:56,152 --> 01:43:00,259
And it's the way of things
that as one story ends...

1251
01:43:00,289 --> 01:43:03,162
another begins.

1252
01:43:03,192 --> 01:43:07,566
I am very glad
to have found you.

1253
01:43:07,596 --> 01:43:12,570
You have sacrificed so much,
but your people need you

1254
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:19,177
to lead them out of this
dark time and into the light.

1255
01:43:19,207 --> 01:43:21,544
I am offering you
an appointment

1256
01:43:22,778 --> 01:43:26,518
to the highest office
in Nottingham.

1257
01:43:26,548 --> 01:43:29,053
If you accept,

1258
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:32,554
you will have the church's
eternal gratitude.

1259
01:43:33,789 --> 01:43:35,421
And mine.

1260
01:43:38,493 --> 01:43:42,500
My city, my people,
in the day since the thief

1261
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:46,371
and his partners and raiders
have been hunted into hiding,

1262
01:43:46,401 --> 01:43:49,072
we have laid to rest
our good sheriff.

1263
01:43:49,102 --> 01:43:53,240
Yet Nottingham still smolders
from the fires of their revolt.

1264
01:43:54,074 --> 01:43:56,046
My baptism was one of fire,

1265
01:43:56,076 --> 01:43:59,216
but I am grateful
for its cause.

1266
01:43:59,246 --> 01:44:02,352
For it has turned me
toward my true calling.

1267
01:44:02,382 --> 01:44:06,351
Serving the cause of peace
as the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1268
01:44:08,355 --> 01:44:11,527
And this has
only one ending.

1269
01:44:11,557 --> 01:44:16,567
With me standing over
the corpse of the Hood.

1270
01:44:16,597 --> 01:44:20,334
Welcome to
the big table, sheriff.

1271
