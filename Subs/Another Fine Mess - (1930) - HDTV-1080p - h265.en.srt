00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,340
Thank you.

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,580
Remember I'm leaving
everything in your care.

6
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,990
Be sure the person who rents
my house is reliable.

7
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,020
- A person you could trust.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,540
- Very good. Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Colonel.

9
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,380
And don't forget to tell me...

10
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,100
Thank heaven he's gone.

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,740
South Africa has my sympathies.

12
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,620
What's the matter?

13
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,550
Have you seen two bozos
running this way?

14
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,060
Sure. They just went in there.
What's wrong?

15
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,660
Trying to make a hotel
out of the city park.

16
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,340
They put two benches together
to make twin beds.

17
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,980
When I told them to go,
the little one

19
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,910
tipped his hat and said:
"Yes, ma'am".

20
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,740
That's what I'm sore about.

21
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,500
He's gone.
Let's get out of here.

22
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,100
Another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

23
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,500
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,510
Let's reconnoiter.

25
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,740
- Sure you have everything?
- Certain.

26
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,820
- Come on or we'll miss the boat.
- Alright.

27
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,630
Come on, hurry up.

28
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,660
- Get a move on.
- Alright.

29
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,340
Is it really safe for us
to go away and leave the place

30
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,030
until Monday.

31
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,380
Sure. The colonel won't be back
for at least six months.

32
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,700
What's the difference if we rent
the house today or next week?

33
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,060
- It's the same.
- Alright. Go on.

34
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,270
- Always starting an argument.
- And you're always blaming me.

35
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,540
Get over there.
Come on.

36
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,700
Let's go out the side window.

37
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,990
Close the drapes.

38
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,500
- This must be the place.
- It's perfectly splendid.

39
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,340
- It reminds me of old England.
- It's just the thing.

40
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,940
Is it the cops?

41
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,190
Who is Colonel Buckshot?
What's he like?

42
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,100
No idea.
I've never met him.

43
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,030
I hope he rents us the place.

44
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,060
It's somebody to rent the place.

45
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,620
- What'll we do?
- Do?

46
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,230
Use your brains.

47
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,900
Put on the butler's clothes
and say the colonel's not home.

48
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,940
It's simple.

49
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,430
- Yes, but if they don't...
- Why you...

50
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,780
Wait.
I hear someone coming.

51
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,150
Is this the home of
Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot?

52
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,300
Yes, sir.

53
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,390
I understand it's for rent.

54
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,220
Is it? I mean, it is.

55
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,780
Of course it is.

56
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,420
I am Lord Leopold Plumtree.
My card.

57
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,030
The colonel isn't home.

58
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,100
- You wish to see the colonel?
- I'd love to.

59
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,300
Colonel Buckshot!

60
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,900
Ollie, Colonel Buckshot!

61
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,660
Wait there.

62
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,340
Colonel Buckshot!

63
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,630
What it is, Hives?

64
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,190
Lord Appletree.
He wants to rent a room.

65
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,860
No, no. Plumtree.

66
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,180
Lord Leopold Plumtree.

67
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,180
And I want to rent
the entire house.

68
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,710
Show then to the solarium.

69
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,820
I'll be right down.

70
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,420
This way.

71
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,620
Good morning.
Many good mornings.

72
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,740
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot?

73
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,500
None other.
Colonel Buckshot at your service.

74
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,780
I'm Lord Leopold Plumtree.

75
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,300
- Delighted.
- My wife.

76
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,740
Charmed.

77
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,460
We've just returned
from our honeymoon.

78
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,020
The hotel is full
and my dear wife suggested

79
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,020
we rent a furnished home.

80
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,020
- You understand.
- Yes, yes.

81
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,540
We'd like to take possession
immediately.

82
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,310
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

83
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,260
- ls there also maid service?
- Yes, yes, yes.

84
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,820
I'd like to see the maid, please.

85
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:21,820
Just a moment.

86
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,860
Hives, you call Agnes.

87
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,900
- Who?
- Call Agnes.

88
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,740
Agnes!

89
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,660
Pardon me a moment.

90
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,940
Why'd you tell them
the colonel was home?

91
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,980
I couldn't help it. The...

92
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,940
You got me into this mess.
You've got to get me out of it.

93
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,550
- What do you mean I got...
- Get the maid's clothes on!

94
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,020
I'm not going to put the maid's...

95
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,580
What a lovely piano.

96
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,660
- It is beautiful.
- Do you play?

97
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,830
Well, yes and no.

98
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,940
Do wangle out a selection.

99
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,020
I'll try.

100
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,020
- I say!
- Beg your pardon, Lord Figtree.

101
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,220
Plumtree.
Lord Leopold Plumtree.

102
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,380
My card.

103
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,980
A thousand pardons.
My mistake.

104
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,220
Pardon me.
It must be the postman.

105
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,300
What do I do with these?

106
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,500
Put them on.
You wear them.

107
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,830
Do you play anything else?

108
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,340
Yes. I'm very efficient
at croquet,

109
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,070
Parcheesi and billiards.

110
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,420
- You have a billiard room?
- Sure.

111
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,900
I'd love to see it.

112
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,500
Certainly.

113
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,420
Follow me.

114
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,860
- Pardon me, my dear.
- Yes, darling.

115
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,980
- Agnes will be right down.
- Thanks, Colonel.

116
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,380
Come on.

117
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,270
The billiard room

118
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,980
is right upstairs.

119
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,980
Right this way.

120
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,220
There's a beautiful,
old masterpiece.

121
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,460
What is the title of that piece?

122
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,030
- "Physic at the well".
- I see.

123
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,860
- The billiard room.
- Yes, the billiard room.

124
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,300
That chair is an old heirloom.

125
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,580
There's a picture
I must show you.

126
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,300
That's a gondola going through
the Panama canal.

127
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,700
In Venice.

128
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,860
And now the billiard room.

129
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,630
- Yes.
- Yes, now we'll have that...

130
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,940
Agnes, this is your new master,
Lord Flagpole Crabtree.

131
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,910
Plumtree.
Lord Leopold Plumtree.

132
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,020
- My card.
- That's right.

133
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,100
Pardon me.
Are you related to the butler?

134
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,060
Yes, they're twins.

135
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,660
One was born in Detroit
and the other in Miami.

136
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,220
- I don't understand.
- That's alright. Neither do they.

137
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,660
- Agnes, you may go.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,390
Agnes, when you see my wife,
give her my regards.

139
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,660
Yes, sir.

140
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,340
The billiard room's this way.

141
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,020
Agnes.

142
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,460
You're Agnes?

143
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,900
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,070
What a striking resemblance
between you and the butler.

145
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,980
Yes, ma'am. I'm twins.

146
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,900
Remarkable.

147
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,260
I'd like some details
regarding the house.

148
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,060
- Yes, ma'am.
- Tell me, Agnes,

149
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,230
- how long have you been here?
- About half an hour.

150
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,820
How silly of me.

151
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,910
I'm so nervous.
I mean, half a year.

152
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,340
To be exact, three months.

153
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,620
How many bedrooms are there?

154
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,510
- I haven't looked yet.
- You haven't looked yet?

155
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,030
I'm still nervous.
That's silly of me.

156
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,460
Bedrooms. Let me see.
There must be bedrooms.

157
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,580
lmagine a house without bedrooms.

158
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,100
That's silly. Let me see.

159
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,390
There's mine and the master's,
the master's and mine.

160
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,580
That's four.

161
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,980
Not forgetting
the couch in the hall.

162
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,540
- Then there's...
- No, no.

163
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,940
There's the master's and yours.
That's two.

164
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,790
Yes, how silly.

165
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,700
- Then there's the nursery.
- Nursery?

166
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,900
- Yes, ma'am.
- I didn't know the Colonel was married.

167
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,150
No, of course.
He has it in case of accidents.

168
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,220
Accidents?

169
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,220
No, you misunderstood me.

170
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,180
That's silly.

171
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,820
He has it in case of accidents
for any of the help.

172
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,550
Kind of a hospital.

173
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,140
- How noble of him.
- isn't it?

174
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,300
Right.

175
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,700
Tell me. How many maids
does the colonel keep?

176
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,220
- He never tells me his private affairs.
- Private affairs?

177
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,700
Servants aren't private affairs.

178
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,020
Some of them are.

179
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,740
I'm the only one left.
The others left last week.

180
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,590
They had housemaid's knees.

181
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,670
Agnes, would you like
to stay on with us?

182
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,950
Don't disappoint me.
Say you will.

183
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,140
You'll be a comfort to me.

184
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,100
My husband will be away
most of the time.

185
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,790
Say that you will.

186
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,340
Go on.

187
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,460
At last I found it,
Lord Appletree.

188
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,550
No, dear fellow. Plumtree.

189
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,300
My card.

190
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,020
Plumtree, Plumtree, Plumtree.

191
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,860
I'm sorry.

192
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,060
Leopold.

193
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,380
- Are you satisfied, darling?
- Certainly, dear.

194
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,700
And what good news I have.

195
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,670
With the colonel's permission,
Agnes has agreed to stay on.

196
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,070
Nothing would please me better.

197
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,860
She's been in my service
since boyhood.

198
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,820
I mean girlhood.

199
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,870
You return to the depot
and attend to our trunks

200
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,780
while I go over details
with dear old Buckie?

201
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,470
Quite right, Plumie.

202
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,830
- Come, Agnes, see me off.
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,750
You're such a dear.

204
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,740
Agnes, call me a cab.

205
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,630
- Huh?
- Call me a cab.

206
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,980
You're a cab.

207
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,940
On the telephone!

208
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,910
Are you sure we can take
immediate possession?

209
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,940
Absolutely.

210
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,940
I'm leaving in a few minutes.

211
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,830
- It won't be long now.
- Wonderful.

212
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,390
What's the rental fee?

213
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,500
- ls $20 a month too much.
- $20 a month?

214
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,660
Yes.

215
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,540
That's practically
giving it away.

216
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,590
I picked it up
for practically nothing.

217
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,110
What a beautiful car.
Is it for sale?

218
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,580
It could be purchased.

219
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,900
By the way,
have you any horses?

220
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,740
Sorry. I've just shipped them
to my plantation in Kentucky.

221
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,140
Kentucky?
What part of Kentucky are you from?

222
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,950
Omaha.
Dear old Omaha.

223
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,460
I thought Omaha was in Wisconsin.

224
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,500
About Agnes' salary.

225
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,340
Don't worry. That's not due
until next month.

226
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,460
Agnes, call Hives.

227
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,870
- What?
- Call Hives.

228
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,340
Hives!

229
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,630
Pardon me a moment.

230
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,740
Hives will be right down.

231
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,860
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.

232
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,540
Won't you have one?

233
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,580
Now, dear Plumtree.
I think that's everything.

234
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,260
I think so. I'll add it up
and give you a check.

235
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,660
- Very good.
- Two, three, four,

236
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,020
dot, carry the one, two...

237
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,140
There you are Hives.

238
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,700
- Hives, what is your salary?
- Pardon me a moment.

239
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,020
By the way,
what is your day off?

240
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,070
- Tuesday.
- Tuesday?

241
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,070
Why today is Tuesday.

242
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,900
I won't alter conditions.
You may have your day off.

243
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,300
On your way out,
tell Agnes I want to see her.

244
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,390
Tell Agnes he wants to see her.

245
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,380
Colonel, you're an easy man
to do business with.

246
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,140
So they've told me.

247
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,460
The last the deal we had...

248
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,660
Just a minute.
I forgot my bow and arrow.

249
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,580
Agnes.

250
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,420
That's my cab.

251
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,820
Get my hat and coat
and go to the door.

252
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,950
Who do you think I am?

253
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,630
Goodbye, Plumie.

254
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,660
- Pleasant journey, Colonel.
- Thank you.

255
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,540
Thank you.

256
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,780
What's this?

257
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,230
- You wish to see Colonel Buckshot?
- What?

258
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,860
Nothing would suit me better.

259
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,180
Colonel Buckshot!

260
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,270
- Pardon me.
- Just a moment.

261
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,060
- Your check.
- That's alright.

262
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,940
Mail it to me in South Africa.

263
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,300
Did you wish to see me?

264
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,660
- Are you Colonel Buckshot?
- At your service.

265
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,910
The last of the Kentucky Buckshots.

266
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,420
Then who do you think I am?

267
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,100
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

268
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,830
Just a moment.
I'll get it.

269
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,070
Where have I seen that face?
Let's see.

270
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,590
No, no, that's not it.

271
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,220
It's...
No, that's not it, either.

272
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,860
Just wait a minute.
I'll get it.

273
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,980
Just wait a second.

274
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,710
Don't tell me, Agnes.
I'll get it.

275
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,060
I'll get it out of here.
Just a moment.

276
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,420
I know who you are.
You're Colonel Buckshot.

277
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,550
Right you are.

278
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,260
Police!
Help! Officers!

279
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,780
Police! Burglars!

280
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,270
Pardon me.
Come, Agnes.

281
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,340
Yes, sir.

282
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,750
- Who are you?
- Do you wish to see the colonel?

283
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,220
He's in there.

284
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,740
And who do you think I am?

285
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,580
I haven't the slightest idea.
Get out of my house.

286
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,020
God save the King!

287
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,100
- Help! Help!
- Come on, boys.

288
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,620
- What's wrong?
- There are burglars in there!

289
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,180
- Burglars?
- That's right.

290
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,300
Give him room!

291
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,060
Halt!

292
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,860
Stop them!

293
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,220
Stop!

294
