Maurice.

You're fat!
- And you are thinner.

English, Mama, English.

9
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,310
She loves you in French.

10
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,680
We all miss you in any language.

11
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,352
He does not look well.

12
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,600
That means she wants
to feed you.

13
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,698
You're away too long.

14
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,615
Almost two years, huh?

15
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,954
Thanks, Maurice.
You remembered.

16
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,325
Bourbon straight,
water on the side.

17
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,168
You and Mr. Gamble!

18
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,661
Only people who speak English

19
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,959
would put things like that
in their stomachs.

20
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,758
You're back on business,
perhaps?

21
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,345
No, no, just to see
my little girl.

22
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,885
Ahh, little ballerina.

23
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,348
She don't go back with you?

24
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,094
No more for me, thanks.

25
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,811
The world has changed.

26
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,521
Uh, yes.

27
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,437
It's not so crazy anymore
like it was after the war, huh?

28
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,934
You remember?

29
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,688
We had much laughter together,
eh, Charles?

30
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,861
Maybe we had too
many laughs, Maurice.

31

[Crowd cheering and singing I

32
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,253
Maurice, how are you?

33
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,879
Some big day, huh?

34
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,973
This calls for a very big
and very cold bourbon and water.

35
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,265
No bourbon, no gin,
no cognac, no anything.

36
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,808
How are you celebrating?

37
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,930
For me, I keep the Perignon.

38
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,397
For you and me.

39
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,609
That, uh, lady over there.

40
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,729
I do say, uh,
she gives you the eye.

41
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,450
That one?
She's not even smiling at me.

42
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,117
The eye without a smile
is the most dangerous eye.

43
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,292
Excuse me.

44
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,465
- Charles!
- Claude!

45
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,179
Ah, I knew you would make it.

46
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,968
Ooh, but you --
I was afraid that --

47
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,807
Nah, don't you know
that bad characters

48
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,096
never die in a war.

49
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,969
Excuse me, I saw my old friend
and I --

50
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,846
This is my dear
and crazy friend,

51
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,144
Charles Wills, Miss Eliswirth.

52
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,438
- Miss Eliswirth.
- Marion, please.

53
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,231
American?

54
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,024
You've been here
all through this?

55
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,739
Oh, we never left.

56
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,279
Dad and I stayed on in an
unoccupied France, Lyon mostly.

57
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,778
How do you know Claude?

58
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,200
Oh, he was an observer
with our outfit.

59
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,822
Haven't seen him
since D-day in Normandy.

60
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,450
I parted company with
the US Army after Saint-Lo.

61
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,792
Back into the FFI?

62
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,127
With the General de Gaulle.

63
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,338
Um, quite a-a coincidence
meeting here.

64
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,003
Well, if I hadn't seen you
in the mirror --

65
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,627
uh, I thought some stranger
was giving me the eye.

66
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,471
But no, no, I didn't see you.

67
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,757
Am I interrupting
anything important?

68
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,135
Well, uh, Marion and I are --

69
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,854
Uh, you must have
influence around here.

70
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,438
You have a drink.

71
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,308
Power of the press, ma'am.

72
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,685
Let's see what my influence and
lots of money can accomplish.

73
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,277
Maurice!
- I've got a better idea.

74
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,398
Let's go to
my father's celebration.

75
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,866
Well, where would he get
enough whiskey for a party?

76
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,488
You don't know my father.

77
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,412
To fathers!

78
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,999
To men!

79
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,000
To Frenchmen!

80
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,720
- We'll continue our celebration.

81
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,510
Bonsoir.
Bonsoir, monsieur.

82
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,058
Marion, ah!

83
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,680
You, my boy, you have a thirsty
look in your eye.

84
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:04,932
Oh, does it show?

85
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,274
It might go away
if you have a drink.

86
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,610
- Andre!
- And, uh, who have we here?

87
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,149
Charles Wills.

88
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,897
He's a reporter
for the Stars and Stripes.

89
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,194
This is my father.

90
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,987
- How do you do, sir?
- A reporter?

91
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,485
We don't need a reporter,
we need a bartender here.

92
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,495
I invited him here
because it seems to be

93
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,989
the only place in town
where you can get a drink.

94
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,241
And do you know that
all these people came

95
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,836
to precisely
the same conclusion.

96
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,650
What is Helen doing here?

97
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,898
Uh...

98
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,571
- Hi!
- What are you doing here?

99
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,193
What are you doing here?

100
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,660
Well, the fact
of the matter is --

101
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,279
Your sister has made me
very proud.

102
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,032
We couldn't tell you
the good news before

103
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,785
but Helen has been expelled
from the university.

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,161
- What?
- If we're going to have a scene,

105
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,585
either ask this young man
to leave or introduce us.

106
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,799
- Marion, please.
- Helen --

107
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,338
Ah, now look, let her alone.

108
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,257
After all, I was expelled
from Harvard, wasn't I?

109
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,801
Why shouldn't a girl follow
in her father's footsteps?

110
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,016
Excuse me a moment.

111
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,136
I'll talk to you later.

112
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,809
I have a feeling
she'll be talking to me, too.

113
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,979
Name, please?

114
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,567
Uh, Charlie something
or other.

115
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,653
He, uh, says he's a bartender.

116
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,022
- Ah, yes!

117
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,899
- Charlie what?
- Uh, Wills.

118
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,323
I wish were a bartender,
a nice civilian bartender.

119
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,664
- Oh, merci.

120

[Speaks French I

121
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,668

- Well, we do in away.

122
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,712
We were only kissing
an hour ago.

123
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,551
We were?

124
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,592
Let me see now,

125
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,931
you were one of the ones
at the Ritz bar.

126
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,266
Ha, no.

127
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,929
Unh-unh.

128
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,397
- No!

129
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,033
I know!

130
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,196
Near the Dhingo Café.

131
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,161
You do remember.

132
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:28,079
No, it's the only other place
I ran into more uniforms today.

133
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,706
Are you rich?

134
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,505
No.
Does that finish me off?

135
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,379
No, but it does slow us
up a little.

136
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,847
We're not rich either,
we just live that way.

137
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,470
Daddy says it's the same thing,
only it's much cheaper.

138
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,391
I think I like him.

139
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,391
That's good, because he'll try
to borrow money from you.

140
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,188
And I don't want him
to be disappointed.

141
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,823
I like the way you kiss.

142
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,567
Really?

143
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,866
My dear, I'm afraid
I've underestimated

144

the alcoholic capacity
of our guests.

145
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,536
I'll only be a few minutes.

146
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,501
Uh, get the bartender here
to help you with it.

147

Say, Wills, Wills,

148
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,169
are you one of the wealthy
Willses from Maryland?

No. No.

150
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,084
- Ah!
- This way, Lieutenant.

151
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,587
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

[Crowd singing "Alouette" I

153

- Where are you from?
- Milwaukee.

00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,973
- Would you help me?
- Sure.

When the Germans came in 1940,

161
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,745
I was sent to school
in Switzerland.

162
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,037
That's where the loot's kept.

163

No!

164
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,875
Daddy put it there so
the Germans wouldn't drink it.

165
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,092
Very resourceful man.

166
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,508
- And lots of fun.
- Is he?

167
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,507
That's his eleventh commandment,
having fun.

168
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,724
Especially now.

169
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,217
He says that after a war,

170
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:13,018
everybody should always be gay
and have fun.

171
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,766
Isn't your father a little old
for this war?

172
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,484
Oh, he wasn't in this one.

173
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,977
He was in the 1918 war.

174
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,445
And he's been celebrating
ever since.

175
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,704
Now that the war in Europe is
over, what are you going to do?

176
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,664
Try to stay out of the war
in the Pacific.

177
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,579
That's very sensible.

178
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,290
That ought to be enough
to tame the tiger.

179
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,107
Charles, I was wondering
what had happened to you.

180
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,351
Nothing, yet.

181
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,023
Everybody's waiting to meet you.

182
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,021
Well, I've really got --
got to report back to the paper

183
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,522
with some sort of story.

184
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,195
Oh, can't you stay
just a few minutes?

185
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,863
I'm sorry, I've got a deadline.

186
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,408
Oh, Lieutenant,
don't take the party with you.

187
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,372
Oh.

188
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,411
That's a nice laugh.

189
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,502
Do you think someday soon
you might be rich?

190
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,920
Could you come back later?

191
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,386
All right, I'll try.

192
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,006
Uh, better yet, I'll meet you.

193
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,053
You call and tell me where.

194
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,051
All right!

195
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,687
Hello!

196
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,981
Who is this, please?

197
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,275
Who?

198
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:49,777
Oh, Helen,
this is Charlie Wills.

199
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,324
No, no, Charlie the bartender.

200
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,572
The Army bartender?

201
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,244
That's right!

202
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,413
Could you give Marion
a message, please?

203
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,252
Tell her that the lights
of Paris go on tonight

204
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,589
for the first time
since the war began.

205
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,253
Well, she wanted to meet me,

206
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,841
at the Arc de Triomph,

207
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,462
right by the Shrine
for the Unknown Soldier.

208
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,805
Thank you!

209
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,097
- Hi!
- Hi!

210
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,685
I thought that --
- Disappointed?

211
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,269
No, but --

212
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,561
The ordinary unnerving,
you know.

213
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,739
[Bells ringing I

214
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,024
Do that again.

215
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,073
Thought you were asleep?

216
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,492
Only my eyes.

217
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,706
And my arm.

218
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,539
They're weaklings,
your arm and my eyes.

219
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,211
Mm-hmm.

220
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,756
Not worthy of us.

221
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,549
Mnh-mnh.

222
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,424
They're not bad eyes.

223
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,434
It's a nice arm.

224
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,520
I'll take you home.

225
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,399
Did you read Thomas Wolf,
"You Can't Go Home Again"?

226
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,121
It's late.

227
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,412
All right.

228
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,624
[Bells ringing I

229
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,643
Promise me something.

230
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,439
Promise?

231
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,487
Don't ever let
the celebration end.

232
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,780
There will be
another celebration

233
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,277
when the rest of the war
iS over.

234
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,325
But it is over.

235
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,619
For us it's over.

236
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,867
I'm sick to death of death.

237
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,334
I want to enjoy things
and have fun.

238
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,879
And live like every day
is the last day.

239
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,798
Wouldn't that be nice?

240
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,547
A lifetime full of last days.

241
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,430
Except there never really
would be a last day.

242
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,481
You're too serious.

243
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,190
Make that nice smile.

244
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,987
That's better.

245
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,833
I don't care if you're not rich.

246
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,599
Chocolate!

247
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,523
Hi!

248
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,192
Hi!

249
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,186
Oh, how wonderful!

250
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,778
[Charles laughs I

251
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,369
- Look!
- Mmm, mmm.

252
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,117
You didn't have to this, my boy.

253
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,413
Oh, yes he did.

254
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,626
He's trying
to make time with me.

255
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,587
- Spam!

256
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,501
What is it,
animal or vegetable?

257
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,376
Powdered eggs!

258
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,718
Chocolate!

259
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,712
You shall not go unrewarded,
my boy.

260
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,634
Come to think of it,
your generosity

261
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,474
shall be repaid this very day.

262
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,717
Now --
- Good morning!

263
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,093
- Good morning!
- Look, meat, eggs.

264
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,470
About the powdered eggs,
you see, they look

265
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,641
something like eggs --
- Never mind.

266
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:52,889
We'll cook them in sherry.

267
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,060
That will make them
taste like eggs.

268
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,558
Helen, please!

269
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:59,313
I wish to make some small token
of appreciation.

270
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,529
Charles, my boy.

271
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,274
A golden opportunity awaits us.

272
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,119
Now, the question is,
are we equal to the challenge?

273
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,954
Well, what is it, sir?

274
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,286
Benedictine
in the fourth race today.

275
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,288
He'll go to the post at 10 to 1.

276
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,961
At a mile and 3/8,
he can't lose.

277
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,960
- Why not?
- Um, it's a trade secret.

278
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,463
Daddy means he has
a hot tip, right?

279
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,134
Another hot tip?

280
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,304
Look, we have less than
two hours to become wealthy.

281
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,302
I think I can come along.
I'll make a phone call.

282
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,600
Excellent!
Now, If we pool our resources --

283
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,939
uh, what is your capital,
my boy?

284
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,808
Oh, about $40.

285
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:40,938
Let's see, that means if we
pool our resources we have $40.

286
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,485
- What a pity.
- Maybe I can borrow some.

287
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,857
Don't you do it, Charles.

288
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,826
He'll keep you as broke
as he is.

289
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,571
Opportunity, my dear,
is concerned with the future,

290
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,072
not the past.

291
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,949
Look, if it's collateral
you're worrying about,

292
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,042
I happen to own oil leases
in Texas

293
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,412
that are worth,
uh, well, you know Texas.

294
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,710
Oh, Daddy.

295
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,334
The oil leases
are a family joke.

296
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,215
Plenty of leases
but not one drop of ail.

297
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,181
- Charlie!
- What?

298
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,766
I feel lucky today.

299
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,761
I'll see what I can dig up.

300
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,389
I have the utmost confidence
in the courage

301
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,640
and ingenuity
of the United States Army.

302
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,189
To horse, my boy, to horse.

303
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,312
Destiny hates a laggard.

304
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,315
Ah! Uh!

305
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,418
- The paper said that --
- Don't be nervous.

306
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,877
Daddy's really very brilliant.

307
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,917
Well, what could possibly
make me nervous?

308
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,007
If we lose the race,
I'll owe half a year's pay.

309
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,842
The money belongs
to four captains

310
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,302
who fought their way out of
Bastogne with their bare hands.

311
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,921
- We won't lose.
- Well.

312
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,139
Did you bet it all?

313
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,929
Every penny.
And at 12 to 1!

314
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,393
Why did the odds go up?

315
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,763
The suckers think
that Benedictine will lose.

316
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,436
What can you expect
of agnostics, my boy?

317
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,979
Over this way, what?

318
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,609
Which one is Benedictine?

319
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,908
Uh, Number 4.

320
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,407
He'll lay back
for the first half-mile.

321
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,874
He looks scrawny.

322
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,371
Lean, my boy!
Lean and ready and fit!

323
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,963
Who gave you this tip?

324
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,101
Where's Benedictine?

325
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,562
Running beautifully.

326
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,147
But where is he?

327
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,893
Sixth.
In perfect position.

328
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,616
- Is Benedictine --
- Seventh!

329
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,706
He's outsmarting them.

330
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,667
Helen!

331
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,583
I think I'll buy a new dress
with my share of the winnings.

332
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,432
[Screaming I

333
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,980
He won!
Benedictine won!

334
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,444
- Of course he won.
- Why should that surprise you?

335
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,654
He won!

336
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,648
Not so much surprise as relief!

337
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,493
You know, at 12 to 1,
that makes your share...

338
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,158
Maybe there's another race
fixed today.

339
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,622
If you could --
- Fixed? Fixed race, my boy?

340
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,082
You mean this race
wasn't fixed?

341
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,792
You've been reading
too many crime novels.

342
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,628
There was no hot tip either,
was there?

343
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,213
Well!

344
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,832
You just picked a crazy
long shot out of a hat!

345
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,005
Intuition and experience,
my boy.

346
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,673
But we could have gotten killed.

347
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,921
It's a wonderful way
to make a living, isn't it?

348
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,678
This is the American
Forces Network in Paris.

349
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,144
A pall of black destruction

350
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,605
and chaos still hangs
over Hiroshima.

351
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,475
Events are now moving swiftly.

352
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,067
The President --
- Hey, Maurice!

353
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,733
Leave it on!
- Did you hear the news?

354
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,355
First things first.

355
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,199
It'll take more one bomb
to end this caper.

356
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,863
One will get you 20
it's over in a week.

357
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,201
Will you cover
60 bucks worth?

358
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,616
You got it.

359
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,079
Don't do it.

360
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,165
Barney just came
from the office.

361
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,536
Japan offered to surrender if...
- What? Where? Who?

362
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,787
...if we let the Emperor
stay in his throne.

363
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,163
- When are we going home?
- Yeah.

364
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,789
Charlie, what's the dope
on discharges?

365
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,212
Well, if you start right now
you're already behind

366
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,051
10,000 other guys.

367
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,426
I'll have to get right back
to the office.

368
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,769
Why?

369
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,480
I tried to phone you.

370
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,646
Don't ever phone me if you
can possibly come yourself.

371
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,940
And don't ever leave
if you can stay.

372
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,947
Maybe we can meet for
late supper or something.

373
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,990
We'll see.

374
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,368
Is it really over?

375
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,333
The war?

376
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,375
Because I want to buy you
silk shirts and silk socks

377
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,296
and silk shorts.

378
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,714
Oh, darling!

379
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,265
Taxi!

380
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,527
What did you do
with my umbrella?

381
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,522
I had it when I started
over here and stopped a second.

382
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,944
Must have lost it.

383
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,987
We've got a Special Edition
coming out.

384
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,407
- You better hurry.
- I'll get you a taxi first.

385
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,620
Taxi!

386
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,787
Now, you stop fussing about me.

387
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,285
Will you --
Will you wait for me?

388
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,833
I think I'll go home early
and give Daddy a shock.

389
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,876
But in this rain?

390
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,795
I may not be able to cook
and to sew,

391
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,259
but I really can
find myself a taxi.

392
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,096
It's the first thing I learned
at finishing school.

393
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,385
Now you go on ahead.

394
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,599
You're a girl
after my own heart.

395
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,344
Make no mistake about it.

396
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,141
I'm after it, all right.

397
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,452
Taxi!

398
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,007
Violet.

399
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,095
Merci!

400
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,146
Marion!

401
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,359
I phoned, and they said
it was all right for visitors.

402
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,855
Did she get my flowers?

403
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,572
Every day.

404
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,283
All my messages?

405
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,947
Every one.

406
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,946
Can I go in now?

407
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,409
- Charles.
- What?

408
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,510
Hi!

409
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,803
How do feel?

410
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,223
The nurse answers
all the stark questions.

411
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,940
The patient improves, but it
is required not to really hurt.

412
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,025
Uh, I was going to ask you
to dance,

413
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,862
but I guess that's out, huh?

414
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,988
I was expecting a younger,
more attractive nurse.

415
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,986
She's the fourth in two weeks.

416
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,658
Daddy's a pincher.

417
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,883
For heaven sakes,

418
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,880
get that guilty look
off your face.

419
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,509
I lost your umbrella.
I gave you the flu.

420
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,100
Don't be silly.

421
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,722
It was raining, I got wet,
so I got the flu.

422
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,565
And it's not your fault.

423
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,359
I was wondering how you would
look out of uniform.

424
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,982
Isn't bad.

425
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,325
It's my fault.

426
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,286
I would have caught this,
anyway.

427
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:30,452
I catch cold even
from weather forecasts.

428
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,495
Thank you for
the lovely flowers.

429
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,335
Oh!

430
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,122
What's the matter?

431
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,999
I don't know.

432
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:45,130
You look so pale
and sweet and faceless.

433
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,973
Remember, the nurse
is right outside the door.

434
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,762
Not that I'll call her.

435
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,773
One thing I learned
these last weeks,

436
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,192
I love you.

437
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,691
You loved me the first day.

438
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,942
I did?

439
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,535
You sure did.

440
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,156
We should have
told each other then.

441
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,532
Look at all headway
we could have made.

442
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,121
For the first time in my life,

443
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,090
I wish I had lots of money.

444
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,835
Oh, money!

445
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:28,681
Daddy says it isn't what
you have, it's what you owe.

446
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,470
I don't even owe enough.

447
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,970
And what are your prospects,
young man?

448
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,938
Prospects?

449
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,524
My old job on the news
at $65 a week.

450
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:39,983
Please!

451
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,524
I'm only suppose to think
beautiful thoughts.

452
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:50,699
Doesn't DuPont or General Motors
need a president or something?

453
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:54,244
Well, the Paris office
of the Europa News Service

454
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,868
needs a reporter.

455
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,335
Paris!

456
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,545
It doesn't pay as much
as the New York job.

457
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:05,134
But you don't need money
to have fun in Paris.

458
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,471
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,098
Well, I've been working
on a book.

460
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,433
I should get back to the States.

461
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,223
Why can't you write
your book here?

462
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,689
Oh, Charlie, darling, please
marry me and let's stay here.

463
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,058
Please?

464
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:25,279
Oh, it sounds so wonderful.

465
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,614
But isn't it a little crazy?

466
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,573
Yes, it is crazy.

467
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,950
If you had any sense, you would
walk right out that door

468
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,748
and never see me
or call me again.

469
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:48,757
Maybe send back my umbrella
and call it quits.

470
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,221
But I haven't any sense.

471
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,091
No sense at all.

472
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,399
You have no sense,

473
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,489
I have a one-degree temperature.

474
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,280
If I were 98.6,
this would never happen.

475
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,083
Forgive me, but, uh,

476
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,302
I'm rather enjoying
playing the anxious father.

477
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,421
After all, it's Helen's
first marriage, you know.

478
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,468
- Only marriage, sir.
- Tut, tut!

479
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,262
No arrogance, please.

480
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,137
Helen tells me that you are
a very serious-minded person.

481
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,307
You know, both feet
on the ground,

482
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,101
hardworking, industrious.

483
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,690
Well, I try to be, sir.

484
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,026
I tell you frankly,
these are not the qualities

485
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,566
I'd hope for in a son-in-law.

486
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,780
I'll, uh, go even further.

487
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,901
They're, uh, not the qualities
to make Helen happy.

488
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,619
Oh, well, sir, I, uh --

489
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,454
I'm going to work
on a Paris news agency.

490
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,244
I'll be surrounded by carefree,
irresponsible characters.

491
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,993
Some of it is bound
to rub off on me.

492
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,746
Hm.
Well, let us hope so.

493
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:09,341
Tell me, do I, uh, do I strike
you as being an unusual father?

494
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,085
You certainly do.

495
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,883
That's a very
straightforward answer.

496
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,426
Try to overcome this tendency.

497
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,970
You understand, of course,
that I can't afford

498
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,558
to give you a large wedding.

499
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,678
I don't care for one, thanks.

500
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,145
- Care for a drink?
- Oh, yes.

501
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,857
I'd love one, thank you.
- Oh, it's too bad.

502
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,601
You know, I'm getting a little
low on this stuff and I was --

503
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,693
- Oh, that's all right, I'll --
- Here you are.

504
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,404
Oh, thank you.

505
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,364
Do you know what you're
getting for a wedding present?

506
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,984
Well, Helen told me
what not to expect.

507
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,533
My dear, sir, you are
getting the old family joke.

508
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,454
4.000 acres of
invaluable oil land.

509
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,702
- Thank you, very much, sir.
- Not at all.

510
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,875
You know, after all it's not bad
being an oil baron,

511
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,873
even if there's no oil, uh?

512
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,475
Well, did you give Helen
your permission?

513
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,140
I had to give her
my permission.

514
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,888
- Huh?
- Claude has asked me

515
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,480
to be the mother
of his children.

516
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,191
Really?

517
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,605
That -- That -- That seems
a bit irregular, doesn't it?

518
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:13,197
Dad, Claude has asked her
to marry him.

519
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,736
Oh!

520
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:19,032
Well, then I suppose
I must kiss you.

521
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,956
Do you, uh, say best wishes
to the bride?

522
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,327
Or congratulations to the groom?

523
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,750
Or which way is it?
I've forgotten.

524
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,044
You just go ahead
and kiss each other.

525
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,020
What did you put
into that kiss?

526
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,062
Well, why don't you come here
and find out.

527
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,492
Helen getting married,
Marion getting married.

528
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:08,119
A father abandoned
in middle age, ahh.

529
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,120
Hmm!

530
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,873
What man could ask for more?

531
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,297
Give me a rewrite
on that, will you?

532
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,519
How you feeling?

533
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,265
- Pretty good!
- Good, good.

534
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,062
That -- That beard looks good.

535
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,026
Ah, Charlie, if you're getting
around to asking for money,

536
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,690
not a chance.
I haven't got a franc.

537
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,360
If I had any, I wouldn't
give it to you anyway.

538
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,825
The prices aren't going up
here like in the States.

539
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,994
- Neither are the --
- Fellas, please!

540
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,242
I've got a wife and baby
waiting in the hospital.

541
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,369
I need 500 bucks
to get them out of hock.

542
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,495
Why don't you
leave them there?

543
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,996
It's the healthiest place
in town.

544
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,340
Ah, you can make jokes,
you're not a father.

545
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,503
Oh, I don't know.

546
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,297
All the returns aren't in yet.

547
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,047
[Baby cryi
ryin
- Ahh! .

548
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,173
How about it, Your Highness?

549
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,675
There's nothing like a hot tub

550
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,893
after a long day's
hollering, is there?

551
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:07,978
Ahh, there.

552
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,106
Look at those legs, will you.
A regular man-killer.

553
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,521
Forgive me, Your Highness.

554
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,145
This is not
the Follies Percheron, you know.

555
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,988
I beg your forgiveness.

556
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,158
What can you expect from
the common herd, my lady?

557
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,120
Huh?

558
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,541
- Claude!
- Charles!

559
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,875
- Well!
- I have good news.

560
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,369
Fine, fine! Where's Helen?

561
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,495
Charlie?

562
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,748
Oh! Oh, how's Marion?

563
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,002
- She's fine.
- Oh, that's fine, fine.

564
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:47,972
Hiya, fatso.

565
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,435
Fatso is right.

566
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,603
Look at me,
bulging out of my own clothes.

567
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,818
I happen to be insane
about each every bulge.

568
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,732
Where's Vicki?
- Being bathed.

569
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,448
Mm.

570
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,863
I just can't help it.
You look so pretty to me.

571
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,488
Of course, I've been looking
at my editor all day.

572
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,785
Oh, did you hit him
for the bonus?

573
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,908
- Mm-hmm!
- I got it, too.

574
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,910
Only it's not a bonus,
it's a loan.

575
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,662
I sent it right off
to the hospital.

576
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,209
So you can tell your daughter
to come out now,

577
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,752
she's all paid for.

578
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:22,720
I'll never,
never be a size 10 again.

579
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,807
Vicki will be
exactly like you.

580
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,931
Then I'll be surrounded
by beautiful women.

581
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,025
That compliment and a martini
would just about square you

582
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,110
for putting me in jail
for nine months.

583
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,856
Mm, martini coming right up.

584
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,376
- Charles?
- Yes, Claude.

585
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,626
I was appointed to the
prosecutor's staff yesterday.

586
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,877
But what about
your private practice?

587
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,674
But this is more important.

588
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,424
There are many collaborators
must be brought to justice.

589
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,971
Sure.

590
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,593
And the lawyers who defend them
will get rich

591
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,222
and you'll get convictions
and be broke.

592
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,143
Ta-da!

593
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,768
Gentlemen, the Queen.

594
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,314
- Ah.

595
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,235
Hello, Highness.

596
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,277
Well, what happened to her hair?

597
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,366
She had some yesterday.

598
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,862
Wishful thinking, that's alll.

599
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:33,161
You know, she's not bad
for a first try.

600
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,658
You had better be beautiful.

601
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,456
A genius and terribly rich.

602
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,296
The beauty she got
from my daughter.

603
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,040
The genius she inherited
from me.

604
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:44,134
You had better get busy
with your contribution, my boy.

605
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,676
The last nine months
I've devoted to you.

606
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,298
Now, I'm going to have fun.

607
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,176
What do you say, sweetheart?

608
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,555
Whee!
- Hey!

609
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,808
No guts, eh?

610
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,812
Ah!

611
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,830
I was wondering
if you could uh, uh --

612
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,619
Thank you!

613
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:19,245
[, uh, trust you're keeping
a record of these loans, huh?

614
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,087
Good night!

615
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,210
Good night!

616
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,719
Good night, angel.

617
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:45,524
Sure you won't come along?

618
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,821
You hate me for not holding your
hand while you have your baby?

619
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,741
If you held my hand,
the next thing, I'd hold yours,

620
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,579
and the next thing,
I'd kiss you.

621
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,039
And the next thing, uh --

622
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,502
Mm, I like that.

623
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,587
You're a glutton.

624
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,501
Coax me not to go out.

625
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:05,874
I can finish this thing tonight.

626
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,546
Please, it's not a thing.

627
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,795
It's a great American novel.

628
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,012
Charlie,

629
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,727
will you still worship me
when you're famous?

630
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,648
Well?

631
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,274
Say it.

632
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,493
It's even better
than the first book.

633
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,334
It's beautiful.

634
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,169
It's too good for them.

635
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,506
Let's send it off tonight.

636
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,796
Come on, wake up.

637
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,799
Spit on it for good luck.

638
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,926
That a girl!

639
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:41,144
This Christmas night,

640
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,890
it is five years since
the end of World War Il.

641
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,518
Veterans everywhere
pray that peace

642
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:51,318
will come with the new year.

643
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,441
["Oh Come All Ye Faithful"
plays I

644
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,374
Daddy?

645
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,494
Daddy.

646
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,337
Daddy?

647
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,928
Well!

648
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,050
Ah.

649
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,679
English, darling, English.

650
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,440
Oh!

651
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,276
I had a bad dream.

652
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,146
Grownups have them too, darling.

653
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,863
I'll get you a glass of milk,
huh?

654
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,821
One kiss for the road.

655
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,282
You're not Ben Hur.
You lost the race.

656
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,903
I need consolation.
Hiya, Charlie.

657
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,576
I lost the race,
and your wife won't console me.

658
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,949
Hi, Charlie!

659
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,621
Next time win the race, huh?

660
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,370
Good night!

661
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,291
Look, Gruyere.

662
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,667
- Mm!
- I didn't forget.

663
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:38,170
Good night, everybody.

664
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,173
Hi!
- Hi!

665
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,149
Charlie!

666
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,400
You're not Charlie.

667
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,273
Where is Charlie?

668
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,127
You haven't told her yet, huh?

669
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,962
Why spoil her fun?

670
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,298
Why let it spoil yours?

671
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,463
I'm peculiar, that's why.

672
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,007
I used up a year of my life
trying to write a book.

673
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,050
For some unaccountable reason,

674
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,094
I thought somebody
would want to publish it.

675
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,013
My boy, you're not
in the least peculiar.

676
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,510
You're merely naive.

677
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,137
Now, I knew a publisher once,

678
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,980
and he made it a rule
never to read a manuscript.

679
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,020
Oh, he would smell it and weigh
it and feel it and taste it.

680
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,688
But read it? No.

681
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,358
Now, if this manuscript
smelled and weighed and felt

682
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,278
and tasted like garbage,
then he published it.

683
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,867
Would you like to know
the secret of success?

684
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,326
Mediocrity, my boy.

685
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,447
To be a rich writer,
you've got to remember

686
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:53,249
your three R's --
riches, ruffians, and rape.

Hey! Hey!

694
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,120
Saturday Evening Post
bought my serial, 15,000 bucks!

695
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,916
- How about that!
- Yeah!

696
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,460
- Goodbye!
- Thanks, thanks.

697
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,833
Unh-unh-unh.

698
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,960
Farewell, hacks, forever.

699
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,463
$15,000, tax-free too!

700
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,433
He could have at least
thrown a party for everybody.

701
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,222
Merci beaucoup.

702
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,570
Charlie, uh, run down
to the police station will you?

703
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,985
What for?

704
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,358
They're holding
some crazy American dame.

705
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,826
Seems she held up traffic
by taking a dive

706
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,571
into a fountain at noon today.

707
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,163
Not much of a story, is it?

708
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,624
No, but you know how Americans
in Paris

709
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,120
love to read about
Americans in Paris.

710
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,838
Oh, all right,
what's her name”?

711
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,956
Helen Wills.

712
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,919
That's my girl.

713
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,025
No use acting as if
you didn't know me.

714
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,644
I'm your wife.

715
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,239
In sickness and in health,
in dry clothes and damp.

716
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,573
You know how you are
with colds.

717
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,284
You had better go home
and change.

718
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,653
We can't go home.
Vicki's at the Dhingo.

719
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,872
- Again?
- Isn't she better off

720
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,413
in a nice respectable bistro
then all alone at home?

721
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,043
This gonna get in the papers?

722
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,791
One more crazy American
jumping into

723
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,383
one more beautiful fountain.

724
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,843
That isn't news any more.

725
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:08,509
Is that why you did it,
to get into print?

726
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,757
I guess it was
silly and stupid.

727
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,349
But it was fun.

728
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,846
- Was it?
- Well, almost fun.

729
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,848
On the verge of being fun.

730
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,646
Only it never is, quite, is it?

731
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,691
No, somehow it never is.

732
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,317
I don't know why.

733
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,036
Maybe it's something
about Paris, or me,

734
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,371
or the times, or something.

735
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,707
It's as if you gotta hurry up.

736
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:40,704
Hurry before -- It's like you're
trying to find out something

737
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,209
terribly important only --
- Only you never do.

738
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,635
Oh, come on now, you always
laughed at these things.

739
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,885
It took a little time,
but you laughed.

740
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,978
It isn't that.

741
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,471
Campbell just sold a serial

742
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,645
to the Saturday Evening Post
for $15,000.

743
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,233
And you hate him for it?

744
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,070
Oh, darling, I think
that's wonderfully human of you.

745
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,738
- Finally.

746
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,835
What's he saying?
He's talking so fast.

747
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:29,961
This is Marcel.

748
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,383
How do you do?
Who are you?

749
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,098
He says he's going
to immortalize me.

750
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,513
What, are you running for office
or something?

751
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,730
Oh, you know me. Always good for
a couple of laughs.

752
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,645
Mrs. Wills,

753
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,236
it's a good thing
to make people laugh.

754
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,651
Don't I get anything?

755
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,899
I paid the fine
to get her out of jail.

756
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:43,577
Papal!

757
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,583
Anglais, sweetie, English.

758
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,211
Papa, I have been waiting
to show you, this morning...

759
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,179
[Speaking French I
- No, Vicki.

760
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,594
Not half and half.
All English.

761
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,343
Watch, Daddy, watch.

762
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:05,019
Hold it!
I haven't been kissed yet.

763
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,191
- Hey, Charlie.
- Barney!

764
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,438
You want to see something great?

765
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,236
Go on.

766
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,827
Oh!

767
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,079
Pretty young to be
hitting the bottle, isn't she?

768
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,751
It's the floor, darling.

769
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,876
Even Pavlova couldn't dance
on a floor like this.

770
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,377
Are you all right?

771
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,720
I'm sorry.

772
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:40,387
- Say something nice.
- It's swell, kid, great.

773
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,726
The boss wants me on an
interview at the Royal France.

774
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,471
I can't handle it,
got a heavy date.

775
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:45,893
Cover for me, will you?

776
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,392
Uh, the woman's name
is Lorraine Qual.

777
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,395
- Who's Lorraine Quarl?
- Café society.

778
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,396
So long, kid.

779
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,523
You got a great act there.

780
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,617
Great!
All it needs is a finish.

781
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,740
You've got the right finish,
haven't you, sweetheart?

782
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,458
Right into my arms.

783
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,290
Mr. Wills!

784
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,308
Mrs. Quarl!

785
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,427
I am Wills from
the Europa News Service.

786
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:28,773
I hate to be late.
I'm sorry.

787
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,643
And I need a drink.

788
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,736
Leon!
- The same, Mrs. Quarl?

789
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,275
Please.

790
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,444
You can skip the usual.

791
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,907
Paris is beautiful.

792
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,947
American women love French men.

793
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,866
French men love American women.

794
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,409
Prices are too high.

795
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:47,910
I haven't picked out
my next husband yet.

796
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,912
Might be the bartender.
At least he has talent.

797
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,380
You've been interviewed before.

798
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,796
The last time, an hour ago.

799
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,340
He wasn't very young
or very attractive.

800
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,180
The interview was
very, very short.

801
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,266
But then, take your time.

802
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,011
Oh. First trip to Paris?

803
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,513
Oh, no, no.
First divorce here, that's all.

804
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,105
Why did you choose Paris?

805
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,692
I get saddle sores in Reno,

806
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,777
and I lose too much money
in Las Vegas.

807
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,112
According to our files,
you were married four times.

808
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,152
Three.
Annulments don't count.

809
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,528
Leon!
- Is something wrong?

810
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,576
Is something right?

811
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:30,168
You -- You really can't tell one
of my marriages from another.

812
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,128
But that's the problem.

813
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,499
Husband number one, for love.

814
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,045
Failure.

815
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,043
Husband number two, for money.

816
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,388
Failure, except for the money
and the name Qual.

817
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,757
Husband number three, annulment.

818
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,476
He forgot to tell me
he already had a wife.

819
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:50,347
Husband number four,
a bulifighter.

820
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:54,726
Four times I bet,
haven't had a hit.

821
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,944
Any children involved?

822
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,437
No.

823
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,692
And that's my only contribution
to humanity.

824
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,446
I told you I was a failure.

825
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,452
Mm, shouldn't you be
writing this down?

826
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,501
Oh, the interview
stopped long ago.

827
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,000
Thank you.

828
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,672
I'm hungry.
What about dinner?

829
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,545
Uh, I am not on
an expense account.

830
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,092
I'm just a struggling
newspaper man.

831
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,806
Oh, well, stop struggling.

832
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,096
The dinner is
on my four husbands.

833
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,559
I'll change and
I'll be right down.

834
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,350
- But what about the --
- Please, Mr. Wills.

835
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,442
At home my analyst charges $50
an hour to listen to me talk.

836
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,782
[Indistinct conversations I

837
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,549
Hey! That's my taxi!

838
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:00,917
- Charles!
- Hello, Claude!

839
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,635
I'm glad to see ya.
How have you been?

840
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,470
- Fine.
- You look fine.

841
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,633
How are ya, Marion?

842
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:08,349
- Fine.
- You look fine.

843
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:09,933
I'm fine, too.

844
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,644
Oh, excuse me.

845
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,935
My sister-in-law, Mrs. Matine,
Mr. Matine, Mrs. Quarl.

846
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,728
How do you do?

847
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,775
Uh, Claude's with
the Prosecutor's Office.

848
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,774
Oh? I hope we haven't done
anything wrong.

849
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,705
Uh, Mrs. Quarl
just arrived in Paris.

850
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,417
I'm, uh, interviewing her.

851
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,252
- How's Helen?
- Fine.

852
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,041
Fine.
Oh, and you should Vicki.

853
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,416
She's -- You know, we really
should see more of each other.

854
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,134
After all, family and --

855
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,505
I'll get in touch with Helen
in the morning.

856
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,631
Goodnight, Mrs. Quarl.
- Good night.

857
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,758
- Good night.
- Good night.

858
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,635
Charles, I really would like
to see you again.

859
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,977
Good night.
- Good night, Claude.

860
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,813
Thank you.

861
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,860
How is Helen?

862
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:08,326
Oh, now what's one little wife
among all your husbands?

863
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,912
I'll imagine you'll catch it
when you get home.

864
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,280
From Helen? Not Helen.

865
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,875
She's the most wonderful,
most understanding --

866
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,505
Do you mind if we don't go on
with the interview?

867
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:24,341
Somehow,
I'm suddenly cold sober.

868
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,131
And it's awfully late.

869
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,174
And if I don't get back to
the office and do this story --

870
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,923
Can I go with you?

871
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,219
To the office, I mean.

872
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,557
Why?

873
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,097
I don't know.

874
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,561
We'll probably never see
each other again, and I --

875
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,352
I'd like to drag the night
out a little.

876
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,351
And I should see that story.

877
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,977
Oh, that office is awful cold
and dingy

878
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,603
at this hour of the morning.

879
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:49,359
You would be surprised
how often I feel cold and dingy.

880
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,156
I'll be simpatico.

881
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,503
Well, good morning.

882
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,880
Now what's the matter?

883
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:14,475
Oh, Charlie, how could you?

884
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,186
Don't Charlie me, sister.

885
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,679
What about you?

886
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,432
I'm sick and tired of you
sitting around these

887
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,434
crummy cafés day and night,
the darling of every phony,

888
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,856
petted by writers
who don't write,

889
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,231
adored by painters
who don't paint.

890
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,732
And what do you write?

891
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,781
Interviews with
useless, sloppy women.

892
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:34,620
Well, at least I don't
jump into fountains

893
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,285
and lap up
all the liquor in Paris!

894
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,533
Well, why don't you ask me
why I drink,

895
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,207
why I jump in the fountains?

896
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,545
That's right, blame me.

897
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,335
Blame me.

898
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,083
Did I want to stay in Paris?

899
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,712
What right have you
to criticize me?

900
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,636
You're suspicious?
You? Ah!

901
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,885
That's a laugh!
Now you just listen to me!

902
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,648
Morning, darling.

903
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,899
Helen.

904
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,072
Do you realize what time it is?

905
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,745
Mm.

906
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,960
Mm, does it matter, darling?

907
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,796
It's 8:00 in the morning!

908
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,007
Mm, it's your turn
to take Vicki to school.

909
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:34,843
Do you realize
I've been out all night?

910
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:38,138
Mm, poor darling.

911
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,137
All right,
I'll take her to school.

912
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,765
Well, don't you care
I've been?

913
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,359
You look awful!

914
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,529
Was it a tough assignment?

915
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,278
I was interviewing a woman.

916
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,325
Mm, that's nice.

917
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,699
You have much better copy
than that.

918
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,758
She was a rich, beautiful,
exciting woman.

919
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,092
She was interested in me.

920
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,015
Well, don't you even care?

921
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,811
What are you trying
to say, Charlie?

922
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:28,480
I'm trying to say
that I love you.

923
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,902
What kind of a woman
did you say she was?

924
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,901
How many kinds are there?

925
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:39,404
Was she really pretty?

926
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,871
I'd lie about it,
but Marion saw her, too.

927
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,490
Yes, she's very pretty.

928
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,038
Marion?

929
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,161
Oh, we ran into
Claude and Marion.

930
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,085
She'll probably try to build it
up into something, but --

931
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,335
Just how rich
and how pretty was she?

932
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,381
Oh, shut up!

933
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,596
Mm, that's nice.

934
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,807
[Telephone rings I

935
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,518
- I don't hear a thing,

936
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,358
do you?

937
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,444
- I'll be back in a minute.

938
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,076
Hello? Marion.

939
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,292
What?

940
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,869
What?

941
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,247
Say that again!

942
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,999
It's a lie!

943
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,843
You know how Marion
has never liked me.

944
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,765
Charlie, we're rich!

945
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,016
We're rich!

946
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,610
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You old fraud!

947
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,854
Why didn't you tell us?

948
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,025
I am not old.

949
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:57,364
I couldn't tell you last night

950
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,233
because I was celebrating
last night.

951
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,825
I stopped by Marion's

952
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,410
on my way home this morning
and had breakfast.

953
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,075
And then told her then.
- How much are we worth?

954
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,289
Marion said that you said
that we're stinking rich.

955
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,580
Oh, Marion always
editorializes.

956
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,168
Money has no odor.

957
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,504
- Oh, especially lots of it!

958
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,543
- English, Vicki, English.
- Are we millionaires?

959
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,883
Insanity, there's a wide
streak of insanity

960
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,923
in this family, Vicki,
on your mother's side.

961
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,844
We have hit an oil gusher!

962
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,716
- We what?
- Qil, darling!

963
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,308
It's about to put Texas
on the map.

964
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:27,769
You mean, those worthless
oil leases of ours?

965
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,309
A generous wedding present
from me,

966
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,682
which I trust you'll remember
and keep in mind.

967
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,355
- How rich are we?
- Well, there's this state law

968
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,479
about only pumping out
80 barrels a day.

969
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,606
Now at $2 a barrel,
that's, uh --

970
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,074
That's only $160 a day.

971
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:42,785
- Seven days a week?
- Of course.

972
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,324
Oil is an act of God.

973
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,447
That -- That's $1,100 a week!

974
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,824
And 27 1/2% tax-free.

975
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,951
- What if we sold out?
- My thoughts exactly!

976
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,704
A capital gain.

977
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,329
But if we didn't sell out,
we'd have an income for life!

978
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,548
Is everybody from
Milwaukee cautious?

979
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,337
Sensible, just sensible.

980
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,337
We'll redecorate everything
from top to toe.

981
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,055
Me too.
I'll have my hair cut.

982
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,218
We'll take Marion's room
and turn it

983
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,718
into a writing room for you.

984
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:10,596
Do you suppose we really could
run through $50,000 in a year?

985
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:13,349
- Well, we could try.
- We?

986
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,567
- Oh! Mm.
- You know what?

987
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,357
Of course,
we could drill another well!

988
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,653
Marion never said a word about
running into you last night.

989
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,867
Mama, what's oil?

990
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:27,829
Oh, Vicki! Oh!

991
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,131
How do you like it?

992
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,100
It's mine, all mine!

993
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,232
Off with the shroud.

994
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,574
No more deadlines,
no more journalism.

995
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,535
The job is dead.

996
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,246
Lower away.

997
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,239
Catch it!

998
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:14,831
That's wonderful.

999
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,421
What are you gonna do now,
Charlie?

1000
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,664
Now?

1001
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,086
Now I'll finish my third novel.

1002
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,175
If this one doesn't
get published --

1003
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,671
It'll get published.

1004
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,970
I got no money worries,
I got no job worries.

1005
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,513
What would I use for an excuse?

1006
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,262
If you got enough money,
nO excuses are necessary.

1007
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,479
Good luck to you, Charlie.

1008
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,565
- Thank you.
- Good luck, there.

1009
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,447
That will be 5,000 francs,
please.

1010
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:54,075
Oh, I should like
to do more for charity.

1011
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,202
- Oh, well, that's nice.
- Helen.

1012
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,046
Uh, pardon me once,
s'il vous plait?

1013
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,415
Uh, 6,000 for another kiss.

1014
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,388
I'm really worth
much more, you know.

1015
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,972
But --

1016
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,967
I never expected to see you
at a charity event.

1017
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:12,968
Neither did I.

1018
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,640
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

1019
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:18,266
- Vicki?
- No, Charlie.

1020
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:20,984
Look, he hasn't moved
from his room all day.

1021
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,568
He's still there.

1022
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,483
He won't eat anything,
he won't say anything.

1023
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,529
Just sits there
in the dark, alone.

1024
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,375
Charlie?

1025
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,818
What's the matter, darling?

1026
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,493
Have you had dinner?

1027
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,294
Do you want me to fix something?

1028
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,457
Go away, Helen.

1029
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,254
Let me alone.

1030
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,886
Is it something I've done?

1031
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,555
Please, Charlie, whatever it --

1032
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,894
All right, I'll admit it.

1033
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,184
You're a good wife.

1034
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,932
You're devoted and loyal.

1035
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,058
You've done your duty.

1036
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,481
Now please go back to your party
and let me alone.

1037
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,496
I'm only trying to help.

1038
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,700
Help what?

1039
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:05,251
You, me, us.

1040
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:08,045
I don't know.

1041
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,259
Help what? This?

1042
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,923
Can you help another rejection?

1043
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,717
Can anybody help that?

1044
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,258
Why?

1045
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,601
Because some publisher
turned you down again?

1046
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:21,097
Yes. Again!

1047
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,894
Again, Helen. And again!

1048
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,268
Can you help it that I'm stupid
enough to spend five years

1049
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,270
writing three stupid books?

1050
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,023
Can you help it
that I'm no writer?

1051
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:33,025
But you are!

1052
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:34,447
You're wonderful.

1053
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,741
They're the ones
that are stupid, not you.

1054
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:41,117
"Dear Mr. Wills,
we regret to inform you --"

1055
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,242
I'm no good, Helen.

1056
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:43,961
Go away and let me alone.

1057
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,625
Oh, Charlie!

1058
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:49,125
Please! I can't explain
my failure to you.

1059
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,797
Now be a good girl
and let me alone!

1060
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,922
But you're not a failure,
not to me.

1061
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,641
When I was 20, I used to think
I would write great books.

1062
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,851
I would be able to do this,
because I was different.

1063
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,391
I wanted perfection,
and that made me different.

1064
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,389
Well, I'm not 20 anymore.

1065
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,560
And it's too late now.

1066
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,978
But we'll try again.

1067
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:08,398
No!

1068
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,817
I just don't have what it takes.

1069
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,940
All I need to do now
is get used to the idea.

1070
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,488
I'm rich.
For the price of a few drinks,

1071
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,078
I could buy fame and friends,
or something like them.

1072
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,742
Why spend years writing?

1073
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,707
I can hold court in some
noisy bar and criticize writing

1074
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,998
and talk about writing and --

1075
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,269
You'll never make it, boy.

1076
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,933
25 bucks says I do.

1077
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,055
Stop this.

1078
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,603
We've already got $75 bet.

1079
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,191
Make it $100.

1080
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,903
All right, $100.

1081
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,021
Sucker.

1082
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:57,534
Charlie.

1083
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,823
- Oh!

1084
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,696
Watch this, baby.

1085
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:02,948
Come on, Charlie!
Pull, pull it, Charlie.

1086
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,792
A-ha!

1087
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,164
Hey, Charlie, you beat me.

1088
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,347
- Voila! Ah!
- That a boy, Charlie!

1089
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,516
All right, Charlie.

1090
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:36,736
Winner and still champion.
And this is the arm that did it.

1091
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,573
Take me home.

1092
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,995
Waiting for the car.

1093
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:48,209
It's getting souped up
for the race.

1094
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,080
- Race?
- Sports car event.

1095
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,298
Monte Carlo to Paris.

- No.

1108
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:21,177
- Kind of quiet, isn't it?
- It's nice, though, isn't it?

1109
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:24,139
Why hasn't Vicki come in
to say goodnight?

1110
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:27,180
Your daughter is in
a compete state of crisis.

1111
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:29,974
One of her front teeth fell out.

1112
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,346
How's she taking it?

1113
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:34,190
Oh, life is completely
over for her.

1114
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,730
She says she'll come in

01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,899
if she doesn't have to smile
or open her mouth.

1116
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:41,615
Sure. I know a big, dramatic
situation when I see one.

1117
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,653
You don't really mind
staying in tonight, do you?

1118
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,156
Of course not.

1119
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,703
How's it going?

1120
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:54,703
Uh, it's not easy
getting started again.

1121
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,079
But you promised.

1122
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,377
And I'm trying.

1123
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,375
And you'll make it.

1124
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,693
Poor little ballerina.

1125
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,657
Ha, thank you, very much.

1126
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,494
Not a bad kiss at all
considering.

1127
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,239
When will you smile again?

1128
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:33,083
At least can you give me
an estimate?

1129
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:36,169
Teeth grow back in a few months,
you know.

1130
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,629
But by that time, those muscles
will be all set hard

1131
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,716
and you won't be able to smile.

1132
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,633
They say you're
the wickedest woman in Paris.

1133
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,006
You know what I'll look like
pretty soon?

1134
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,595
Daddy!

1135
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,806
May I borrow
a pair of cuff links?

1136
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,729
I can't seem to --

1137
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,820
Both of you put
your upper plates back in,

1138
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:06,067
you're making me self-conscious.

1139
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,738
Can I dance for you, Grandpa?

1140
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,406
In the morning, my dear.

1141
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,450
I have to get up
at 6:00 tomorrow.

1142
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,868
Well, now that will
work out fine,

1143
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,456
because I should be
getting in by then.

1144
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,246
Good night, darling.

1145
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,840
Bon nuit.

1146
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:28,722
Milk, literature,
what's the meaning of this?

1147
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,090
I'm supposed to be working.

1148
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,342
- Your idea?
- It's a fine idea.

1149
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,095
Don't you corrupt him.
- I wouldn't think of it.

1150
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,097
But we will miss you
at the Wilsons'.

1151
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,395
Can you imagine throwing
a white tie party

1152
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,063
simply because it's Thursday?

1153
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,777
Couldn't we go?

1154
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,237
Oh, Charlie.

1155
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,856
Really, it would
be good for me.

1156
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:49,485
And tomorrow morning,
I'll chain myself to that chair.

1157
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,860
Please!

1158
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:58,043
Why do I always end up saying
yes when I really mean no?

1159
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,787
By the way,
I'm bringing a friend.

1160
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,131
He's an international
tennis bum.

1161
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,920
Paul.

1162
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,677
Now don't worry about him
at the Wilsons',

1163
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,262
he's invited everywhere.

1164
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,429
Come to think of it, that's, uh,
how he makes his living.

1165
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,928
You mean he gets paid
for being a guest?

1166
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:18,725
No, no.
Uh, he steals the silverware.

1167
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,189
Charming.

1168
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:24,027
Paul, my, uh, my daughter
and Charles Wills,

1169
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,691
my son-in-law.

1170
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:26,733
How do you do?

1171
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,527
Enchante.

1172
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,404
I hear you played in Rome.

1173
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,201
I play all the tournaments.

1174
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,540
How do you make out?

1175
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,534
Brilliantly,
until the second round.

1176
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,331
Then invariably some
young Australian

1177
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,000
or American school boy beats me.

1178
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,918
But nobody beats him
in jumping over the net

1179
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:46,712
and congratulating the winner.

1180
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,678
I'm the champion graceful loser.

1181
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,220
Forgive me, but you're the lady
in the fountain

1182
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,763
in the Café Dhingo.

1183
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,351
Why, it's my favorite painting.

1184
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,222
Whenever I'm in Paris,
I go there to stare at it.

1185
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,564
Well, you're in luck.

1186
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,525
Now you can stare
at the original.

1187
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,816
Come with me, Paul.

1188
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,189
Until later.

1189
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,240
Sort of appealing, isn't he?

1190
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,738
- What?
- Appealing.

1191
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,663
Yes, in a revolting
sort of way.

1192
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,581
Enchante!

1193
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,101
Well, my dear, it was
the funniest thing you ever saw.

1194
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,852
All those gangsters
on the television,

1195
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,605
and it's DuFour asking
all those questions.

1196
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,697
Nobody in New York works at all.
- What?

1197
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,783
What did George Bernard Shaw
die of?

1198
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:55,493
Mostly old age.

1199
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,456
You're going to drive
in this race yourself?

1200
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,004
Certainly.

1201
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:12,093
- What do you get if you win?
- What do you get?

1202
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,839
You get to be winner,
that's what you get.

1203
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,841
Well, what do you know.

1204
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:20,389
It's my wife.

1205
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,228
Hiya, wife.

1206
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:29,064
All right, sporting blood,
run along to the locker room.

1207
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,107
Come back in a few minutes,
Paul.

1208
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,526
It's only his guilty conscience.

1209
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,319
It won't take long.

1210
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:40,660
Hey, what kind of a wife
are you, dancing with other men?

1211
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,704
- The average kind, neglected.
- Oh.

1212
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,997
What's with Mr. Tennis and you?

1213
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,669
Oh, we're Paul and Helen now.

1214
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,294
- Mm.
- He's sweet and attentive.

1215
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,467
Doesn't think it's terrible
at all that I'm married

1216
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,840
and have
a seven-year-old daughter.

1217
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,513
Maybe he just wants
to be mothered.

1218
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,557
- Not exactly.

1219
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:07,182
He's made several conjectures,
but that wasn't one of them.

1220
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:10,356
Well, let me know
how he makes out.

1221

1222
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,897
Lorraine Quarl!

1223
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,615
You've forgotten me?

1224
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,154
Oh, believe me, the only thing

1225
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,368
I've forgotten about you
is your name.

1226
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:22,080

Oh, it's so good to have
my arms around you again.

1229
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:30,255
Oh, well, you've got me
confused with somebody else.

1230
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,422
We never got that far.
- Why not?

1231
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:35,588
You get married again?

1232
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,052
Of course.

1233
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:39,047
And I'm embarrassed now
to get rid of him.

1234
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,346
Are you still married?
- Yes, of course.

1235
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,764
To the same woman?

1236
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,388
To the same wonderful woman.

1237
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:51,360
I have to say that, 'cause
she's standing right here.

1238
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,696
May I present my wife, Helen,
Mrs. Quarl.

1239
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,565
Oh, it's Mrs. Johnson now.

1240
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,317
Oh, but not for long.

1241
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:01,820
How do you do?
- I'm not quite sure.

1242
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:05,415
You're much prettier
than I expected.

1243
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:08,285
And you're much less beat up
than you have a right to be.

1244
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:14,545
Uh, is it all right
if I, uh, come back now?

1245
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,714
Oh, Paul Lane,
this is the, uh,

1246
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,257
temporary Mrs. Johnson.

1247
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,177
The best mediocre tennis player
in the world.

1248
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,969
I've seen you around my hotel.

1249
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,594
Oh, I always stay
at the Royal France here.

1250
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:28,097
Tennis anyone?

1251
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,848
Yes!

1252
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:20,948
Your hair is like wine.
It keeps you drunk.

1253
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:24,286
Charlie, I'd like to go home.

1254
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,575
Home?

1255
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:27,993
What's the matter?

1256
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,457
Nothing.
I'd just like to go home.

1257
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:33,795
Does that sound reasonable
to you?

1258
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,665
- Are you going to take me home?

1259
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:38,383
Oh, I would, but I can't.

1260
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:42,095
I promised to show Lorraine
how fast the car would go.

1261
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,964
Do you mind if Paul
takes me home?

1262

Paul?

1263
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,676
- Paul who?
- Paul anybody.

1264
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,177
A party like this,

1265
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,395
there must easily be six
or seven Pauls around.

1266
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:56,769
You can't hold
a serious discussion with her.

1267
01:16:56,904 --> 01:17:01,068
I can get up to 60 miles an hour

Well, that -- that's a habit
you must try

1271
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,557
and grow out of, kitten.

1272
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:38,560
Why do grownups drink milk
when they have all 32 teeth?

1273
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,937
Well, we develop butterflies
in our stomach,

1274
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,189
and milk seems
to quiet them down.

1275
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,656
How do they get
in your stomach?

1276
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,072
They usually hide
in the bubbles of champagne.

1284
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:23,901
We're going to church first.

1285
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,115
Is it Sunday already?

1286
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,076
What happened to Friday
and Saturday?

1287
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,570
Run along, Vicki.

1288
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,288
Are you coming, Daddy?

1289
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,703
I'll meet you
at the bois later.

1290
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,128
Church on Friday?

1291
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,793
What happens at church
on Friday?

1292
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:45,260
The usual thing.

1293
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,970
Well, as long as you're in
that sort of mood,

1294
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,682
can I expect a little sympathy
for this head?

1295
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,471
Heads?

1296
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,971
Very little.

1297
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:58,518
What did I do?

1298
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,643
That, I'd be
very interested to hear.

1299
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:30,801
I'd like to go for a ride
on that thing myself.

1300
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,594
How about it?

1301
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:43,025
Must you look so grim?

1302
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:47,063
I'm waiting to hear the end
of the midnight ride

1303
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,531
of Paul Revere.

1304
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,776
You got the car up
to 103 miles an hour

1305
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,323
and then started back, right?

1306
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,162
Right.

1307
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,032
Then what?

1308
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,579
Then nothing.

1309
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:03,797
I dropped Lorraine at her hotel,
or she dropped me at the house.

1310
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,461
I forget which.

1311
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,960
You sure that's alll
you've forgotten?

1312
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:12,760
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but nothing happened last night.

1313
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:18,227
Tonight's another night.

1314
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,937
She'll be beautiful again.

1315
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,227
You'll be full of wine again.

1316
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:25,772
And nothing will happen again.

1317
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,690
Who took you home last night?

1318
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,564
That tennis player?

1319
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,707
He didn't exactly take me home.

1320
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,452
Oh!

1321
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,330
He asked me back to his hotel
for a nightcap.

1322
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:46,672
I went.

1323
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,586
Did you have to
fight your way out?

1324
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,630
Oh, there was a battle,
all right.

1325
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:54,631
But it wasn't Paul I had
a fight with, it was myself.

1326
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,599
Did you win?

1327
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,434
Now you listen!

1328
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,725
I'm under the same strains
and stresses you are.

1329
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,143
I live in Paris, too.

1330
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,016
And I'm bored, too.

1331
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:06,233
And all that time,
I had a picture

1332
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,818
in my mind of you
and that woman.

1333
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,857
And don't underestimate Paul.

1334
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,823
He's charming and attentive
and...

1335
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:21,958
And I'm so unhappy.

1336
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,168
Charlie, let's go home.

1337
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:25,957
All right, as soon
as Vicki finishes with --

1338
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:27,956
I mean really home!

1339
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,584
America! Home!

1340
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:36,597
It won't work, running home.

1341
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:43,597
Charlie, let's go back,
before we crack up.

1342
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:49,314
Please.

1343
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,733
If you love me,
let's go back home.

1344
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,985
You used to say
"Let's live it up a little."

1345
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,111
And you were right.

1346
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,578
There's lots of time to go home.

1347
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,788
Plenty of time for everything.

1348
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,793
Suppose time runs out on us.

1349
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,788
You're just having
a bad day, darling.

1350
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,881
Tomorrow will --
- I've been having a bad day

1351
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,842
for a year now.

1352
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,212
Maybe I'm growing up.

1353
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,931
It's too late to grow up.

1354
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,178
I'll tell you what.
Come racing with me.

1355
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:24,769
We'll go to Monte Carlo.

1356
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,809
Why is winning a race
so important?

1357
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,525
Oh, I don't know.

1358
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,394
Maybe I could do a short story
about racing.

1359
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,487
Why not?

1360
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,071
Oh, all right, all right.

1361
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,611
I get a kick out of racing.

1362
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:37,904
It's fun.

1363
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,447
To quote
your illustrious father,

1364
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,912
nothing is more important
than fun.

1365
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,451
Does that make me sound stupid?

1366
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,450
Is that what you want me to say?

1367
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,579
Come with me, Helen.

1368
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:56,301
No, Charlie.

1369
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,545
Well, maybe I'll take
somebody else.

1370
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,592
Wouldn't that be reasonable?

1371
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,355
You'll find a reason
to make it reasonable.

1372
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:08,973
Look out for Vicki, will you?

1373
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:10,816
Well, where are you going?

1374
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,488
To do something important --

1375
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,357
buy a new hat.

1376
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,780
[Engines revving I

1377
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,875
[Tires screech I

1378
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:10,140
Can we stop for a while now?

1379
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,388
Please?

1380
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:47,849
Cognac, quickly, two of them.

1381
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,217
Mr. Wills.

1382
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:53,437
Mrs. Wills, is she here?

1383
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:13,115
This ought to be good.

1384
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,920
Well, look who's here!

1385
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:20,915
What's the news
from the racing world?

1386
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,133
I called you at the house.
You weren't there.

1387
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,298
Of course not.

1388
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,467
I'm here.

1389
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,465
That's not funny.

1390
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:35,141
You haven't been at that house
for a week.

1391
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:39,062
I didn't think that was
very funny either.

1392
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,403
Now I think
it's very, very funny.

1393
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:46,240
You remember Paul, don't you?
No?

1394
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:50,987
Well, that's sort of funny, too,
because I remember Lorraine.

1395
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,830
Uh, will you join us
for some dinner?

1396
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,323
Ah, shut up!

1397
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:55,949
I'd love to join you.

1398
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:01,630
What time does he drink
champagne from your slipper?

1399
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,624
We've already done that.

1400
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,045
How do like him?

1401
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,970
Don't you think
he makes me look drunker?

1402
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:14,389
I hope you don't mind
a harmless little dinner.

1403
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:15,556
Oh, come on, Paul.

1404
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,430
You can do better than that.

1405
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:22,106
You could tell them to go away,
for instance, leave us alone.

1406
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,648
Not me, dear.

1407
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,270
He's your responsibility.

1408
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,865
Oh, please.
We're all very civilized, no?

1409
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,483
No.

1410
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,235
That's my boy.

1411
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,865
Touch me again
and I'll take a poke at ya.

1412
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:38,368
I wouldn't do that, Charlie,

1413
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,915
because then I'd have to
take a poke at Lorraine.

1414
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,586
- What's funny?
- Why, you, me, all of us.

1415
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,334
Very funny.

1416
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:03,226
Please Charles. Charles.

1417
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,900
Please.

1418
01:28:31,097 --> 01:28:34,135
Wiseguy!

1419
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:37,385
The world's full of wiseguys.

1420
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,358
Helen!

1421
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,243
Oh! Oh, Helen!

1422
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,380
You're beautiful.

1423
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,052
And married.

1424
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,720
And exciting.

1425
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:19,594
And rich, too.

1426
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:27,108
Ah, love, old soul.

1427
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:30,229
Of course I love you.

1428
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:34,154
Love is never of course.

1429
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:35,902
Is it?

1430
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,120
Please, I'll never
let you be lonely.

1431
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:47,833
Paul?

1432
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,081
Hm.

1433
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,419
How are we going to tell him?

1434
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:55,796
Tell him?

1435
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,344
Tell him what?

1436
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:01,218
About us.

1437
01:30:01,354 --> 01:30:03,891
That you love me.

1438
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:06,482
I'm not going back to him.

1439
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,021
Why, that's silly.

1440
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:13,322
Well, of course
you're going back to him.

1441
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:16,067
Well, if you don't go back
to him,

1442
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:17,863
well,
he'll spoil everything for us.

1443
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,953
You can see that, can't you?

1444
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:27,919
Of course, darling.

1445
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:34,506
I stay married
and keep you on the side.

1446
01:30:34,638 --> 01:30:39,348
And when I'm lonely -- ha!

1447
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:40,966
Oh, brother!

1448
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,059
The idea wasn't invented
just now.

1449
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:45,680
It's done all the time.

1450
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:48,773
Half your crowd
have arrangements.

1451
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,064
Is that what you expected of me?

1452
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,530
Helen, listen.

1453
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,696
What's the matter with you?

1454
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,537
Suddenly,
I've got very cold feet.

1455
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,076
Charlie.

1456
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,792
Please, Charlie.

1457
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,541
Do you want me to go away?

1458
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,385
Is that what you want?

1459
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:43,221
[Doorbell ringing I

1460
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:44,384
Just a minute.

[Doorbell ringing I

1462
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:54,566
Helen!

1463
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,480
I am sorry.

1464
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,700
I couldn't find a taxi.

1465
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,911
I-l couldn't --

1466
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,341
Doctor.
Go and see Wills.

1467

[Speaks French I

1468
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:47,027
He's outside.

1469
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:49,029
He can't see her.

1470
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,076
I won't let him.

1471
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,075
Marion.

1472
01:35:04,032 --> 01:35:06,114
You took my umbrella.

1473
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,947
I'm sorry, darling.

1474
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,668
So sorry.

1475
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:24,716
Please forgive me.
- Shh.

1476
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:31,590
Take care of Vicki.

1477
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,975
Don't let Vicki make
the same mistakes.

1478
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,868
I'll always love you.

1479
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,489
Please, Mr. Wills.

1480
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:30,698
Leave us alone.

1481
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:05,062
Mr. Wills --

1482
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:06,901
Get out.

1483
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,816
You'll have to leave here.

1484
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:14,530
Now, Mr. Wills,
this no way to --

1485
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,027
Get out of here!

1486
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,747
Out in the hall, Doctor.

1487
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:30,254
You had better go, son.

1488
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:31,751
Vicki's alone.

1489
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:58,199
Charlie, what are you
going to do, son?

1490
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:02,620
You've got to talk to Marion.

1491
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:06,461
If you don't,
you're going to lose Vicki.

1492
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:08,455
She's going into court today

1493
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:10,673
and going to ask for custody
of Vicki,

1494
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,215
charging you are unfit
as a parent.

1495
01:38:14,347 --> 01:38:16,463
She's right.

1496
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:19,591
I'll hurt Vicki,
just as I did Helen.

1497
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,388
What will you do?

1498
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:26,982
I want to go home.

1499
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,976
All the way home.

1500
01:38:53,052 --> 01:38:55,134
A thing of beauty, huh?

1501
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:56,549
Oh, Maurice.

1502
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,013
I'm sorry, I'm late now.

1504
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,183
Always in a haste.

1505
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:03,517
And as a rich American,
it's even worse.

1506
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:05,432
Not rich anymore, Maurice.

1507
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:08,523
What happened to the, uh, oil?

1508
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:10,267
No?
- No, Maurice.

1509
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:13,020
It changed back to salt water
a year ago.

1510
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,147
Oh, that's unfortunate.

1511
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:16,990
Maybe not.

1512
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:20,159
You must dine with us tonight,

1513
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:23,872
like old times, Charles.

1514
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,035
I don't know.

1515
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:27,079
It depends.

1516
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,373
Jeanette will be
very disappointed.

1517
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:33,169
You have many things
to remember together.

1518
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,588
Come back, Charles, please.

1519
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:40,179
Oh, I'll try.

1520
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:16,132
Charlie.

1521
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:23,006
Hello, son.

1522
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:28,891
What happened?

1523
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,561
Oh, a slight stroke.

1524
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:33,649
When?

1525
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:36,611
Eight or nine months ago.

1526
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:38,104
But you never wrote me
about it.

1527
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:42,576
Oh, it wasn't serious.

1528
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:46,913
Mostly old age.

1529
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:53,037
Charlie, I read your book.

1530
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:55,209
It's good.

1531
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:58,459
Very honest.

1532
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:00,176
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1533
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,465
I liked it.

1534
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:03,634
I liked it, fine.

1535
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:08,476
Uh, here.

1536
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:11,596
For you, Havana cigars.

1537
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:16,268
The kind you like.

1538
01:41:16,404 --> 01:41:17,269
Shall I open them for you?

1539
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:19,521
Oh, later.

1540
01:41:19,657 --> 01:41:24,072
Uh, doctor says
when I'm better, huh?

1541
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:33,626
Where's Vicki?

1542
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:36,496
You've come for her?

1543
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,841
If I can get her back again.

1544
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:42,882
Good. Good.

1545
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:46,473
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1546
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:01,154
You're taller.

1547
01:42:01,282 --> 01:42:02,443
Daddy.

1548
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,191
What?

1549
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,068
You're not gray.

1550
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:09,696
I told everybody at school
you'd be gray.

1551
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:12,494
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1552
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:17,621
Oh, here.
- Thanks.

1553
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:21,503
Claude!

1554
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:25,386
Welcome, Charles.

1555
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:28,176
I'm very happy to see you.

1556
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:31,392
Thanks.
For everything, thanks.

1557
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,602
As soon as I got
your telephone message,

1558
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:37,440
I went to school and got Vicki.

1559
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,729
Look, Daddy! Look!

1560
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:42,979
Uh-oh! Oh! Oh!

1561
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:52,121
It's wonderful, as usual.

1562
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:53,114
- Daddy!
“What?

1563
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:54,740
Could we go to the bois?

1564
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:57,414
Remember the railroad train?

1565
01:42:57,546 --> 01:43:00,004
- Well, I --
- Oh, please?

1566
01:43:00,132 --> 01:43:01,873
Please?

1567
01:43:02,009 --> 01:43:04,797
That was the very first thing
I wanted to do when you came.

1568
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:10,215
You've got about an hour
till Marion comes back.

1569
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:11,933
I'll wear my new coat.

1570
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:13,722
Okay.

1571
01:43:16,023 --> 01:43:17,639
How is Marion?

1572
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:21,109
She's fine.

1573
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:22,727
I want you to know, Claude,

1574
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:25,730
how much I appreciate --
- Oh, I didn't do anything.

1575
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:28,153
I showed Marion your letter.

1576
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:31,573
She couldn't stop you
from seeing Vicki.

1577
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:35,449
I was hoping she would
let me have Vicki back.

1578
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:38,121
I've got to have her, Claude.

1579
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:39,540
I need her.

1580
01:43:39,672 --> 01:43:43,711
Yes, I think she needs you, too.

1581
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:45,083
Daddy!

1582
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:46,334
Daddy! Hurry, Daddy!

1583
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,381
The hour is almost up.

1584
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:50,221
I bought your book.

1585
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:54,596
And about Marion,

1586
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:56,936
if we are careful,

1587
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,930
it may be all right.

1588
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,021
- Daddy?
“What?

1589
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,314
What's wrong?

1590
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:46,902
Why, nothing, darling.

1591
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:47,987
Why?

1592
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,526
You didn't even look at me.

1593
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:51,194
You didn't even wave at me.

1594
01:44:51,327 --> 01:44:53,819
Oh.
Will you give me another chance?

1595
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:55,115
You get back on that train
and I'll --

1596
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:59,366
Daddy, may I sit out
the next ride?

1597
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:02,460
Oh.

1598
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:05,046
I'm really getting too old
for that sort of thing.

1599
01:45:05,174 --> 01:45:08,542
- Don't you think so?

1600
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:12,466
Yes, you're real old now.

1601
01:45:16,894 --> 01:45:22,230
Darling, do you ever think
of your mother?

1602
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:24,019
Oh, yes.

1603
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,861
I don't want you
to forget her.

1604
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:31,572
I have a picture of her
in my room.

1605
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,068
Grandpa says I look like her.

1606
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:37,821
Do you think, so, Daddy?

1607
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:39,664
Yes.

1608
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:43,785
Very much like her.

1609
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:46,208
That's lucky for me.

1610
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,591
- Daddy?
“What?

1611
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,505
Why don't I live with you?

1612
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:56,597
Why? Aren't you happy?

1613
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:58,591
Yes.

1614
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:01,310
But not perfectly happy.

1615
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:03,099
Do you know what I mean?

1616
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,105
Yes. I know what you mean.

1617
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:12,276
Then I can come
and live with you?

1618
01:46:12,408 --> 01:46:14,319
I don't know.

1619
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,071
I don't know.

1620
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:24,208
Don't you want me to?

1621
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:27,203
Oh, of course, darling.

1622
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:28,955
Oh, Daddy!

1623
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,048
If you really love me,

1624
01:46:31,176 --> 01:46:34,760
please let me
come and live with you.

1625
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,220
Please!

1626
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:43,349
We'll see.

1627
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,017
Say yes, Daddy.

1628
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:51,102
Yes.

1629
01:46:54,742 --> 01:46:56,858
There, you see?

1630
01:46:56,994 --> 01:47:00,407
It wasn't so hard to say
yes, was it?

1631
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:05,499
Hello, Uncle Claude.
From the bois,

1632
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:07,335
we went to Hermes,
and we bought something

1633
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:10,330
for you, Uncle Claude,
and for Aunt Marion.

1634
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:11,956
And something for me, too.

1635
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:15,301
It's a wonderful store
and a wonderful day!

1636
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:18,800
Oh, Aunt Marion!

1637
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,761
You ought to see
what we bought for you.

1638
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:26,183
It's a surprise.
Look!

1639
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:28,056
You're late for your nap.

1640
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:30,854
- But I thought today --
- Go on up to your room.

1641
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:32,351
Don't you want to
see your present?

1642
01:47:32,488 --> 01:47:34,149
Do as I say, please.

1643
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:43,821
Hello, Marion.

1644
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:45,540
Hello, Charles.

1645
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:47,500
It's good to see you again.

1646
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,297
I'm sorry about getting back
so late with Vicki.

1647
01:47:59,765 --> 01:48:04,601
Oh, well, she would have been
too excited to sleep anyway.

1648
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:07,937
And it's very important.

1649
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:10,477
You've done a wonderful job
with Vicki.

1650
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:14,352
She's grown up.

1651
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,195
How do you find Paris?

1652
01:48:19,076 --> 01:48:21,067
Well, most of the old crowd
is gone.

1653
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,945
Funny,
I dropped in at the Dhingo bar

1654
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:28,541
this afternoon,
just to see how it looked.

1655
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:30,751
There wasn't a man I knew.

1656
01:48:34,383 --> 01:48:37,045
I should think
you've had enough of bars.

1657
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,095
As I wrote you,

1658
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:44,932
I take one drink
every afternoon, but no more.

1659
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,267
And I take that drink
deliberately.

1660
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:50,013
Just so the idea of taking
a drink won't get too big.

1661
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:51,480
Of course, Charles.

1662
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:53,645
We understand.

1663
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:56,940
Sometimes I forget
and don't take the drink.

1664
01:48:57,072 --> 01:49:03,068
But, well, I went to the Dhingo
to see how it looked.

1665
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:05,285
I went to a few
other places, too.

1666
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:11,326
Places where, uh, Helen and I...

1667
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:16,623
Look, Marion.
I just can't keep on talking.

1668
01:49:16,759 --> 01:49:22,300
I'm all tied up in knots here.

1669
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:29,269
Marion, can I have Vicki back?

1670
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:37,064
I don't know.

1671
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:40,609
It's all very well to talk
about one drink a day,

1672
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:44,325
but what guarantee
have we that --

1673
01:49:44,453 --> 01:49:48,071
Well, when I --
I think of those wasted years.

1674
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:50,369
But I think about them too!

1675
01:49:57,883 --> 01:49:59,999
I'm working hard now, Marion.

1676
01:50:00,135 --> 01:50:04,254
I've, uh, got a contract
for several short stories.

1677
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:07,256
And I'm -- I'm starting
on another book.

1678
01:50:07,392 --> 01:50:09,633
And my sister's coming
from Milwaukee to --

1679
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,477
to keep house for me.

1680
01:50:14,733 --> 01:50:17,566
I want Vicki.

1681
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,810
Please, Marion.

1682
01:50:19,947 --> 01:50:21,563
If we wait much longer, I'll --

1683
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:26,613
I'll lose her childhood
and my -- my chance for a home.

1684
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:32,866
I-1 just can't lose her,
don't you see?

1685
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:37,040
It would be almost like
having Helen back.

1686
01:50:40,843 --> 01:50:41,833
Marion.

1687
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:44,381
I can't help it.

1688
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:46,845
I'll never, in my life,
be able to forget that morning

1689
01:50:46,974 --> 01:50:51,684
when Helen, soaked and --
and shivering.

1690
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:55,350
You locked her out!

1691
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:56,893
Marion!

1692
01:50:57,025 --> 01:50:59,437
But you only remember
one night.

1693
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:04,189
How long are you gonna make me
pay for that one night?

1694
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:06,907
What about those years
Helen and I loved each other?

1695
01:51:07,035 --> 01:51:09,276
I don't want to hear about it!

1696
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:13,657
Marion, you're not gonna
let me have Vicki?

1697
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:15,453
No.

1698
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:20,296
Marion, please.

1699
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:22,916
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

1700
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,517
I'm sorry, Charles.

1701
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:45,438
What will I do?

1702
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:46,814
We'll see.

1703
01:51:51,455 --> 01:51:53,617
Thanks.

1704
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,089
- I'll get dinner started.
- Marion.

1705
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:18,896
There's no use
talking about it.

1706
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:20,105
He's not getting Vicki.

1707
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:23,602
Not now, not tomorrow, never!

1708
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:24,977
Why?

1709
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:27,275
Do you hate him that much?

1710
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:30,991
Yes.
For what he did, yes!

1711
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:32,484
Yes.

1712
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:33,861
It's true.

1713
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:36,580
He committed
an unforgivable crime,

1714
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:39,450
against you, personally.

1715
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:43,045
He's guilty of never knowing
you loved him.

1716
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:45,665
You found him,
but he married Helen.

1717
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:48,668
And yes, he's guilty
of that, too.

1718
01:52:48,804 --> 01:52:52,547
And being guilty, of course,
he must be punished.

1719
01:52:52,683 --> 01:52:54,344
The penalty?

1720
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:56,683
What would hurt him most.

1721
01:52:56,812 --> 01:53:00,555
Take away what he loves most,
his little girl.

1722
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:14,326
My poor darling, we can't
have everything we want.

1723
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:18,573
Take me.

1724
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:21,076
I wanted all your love.

1725
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:24,420
I wanted our own child.

1726
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:28,883
A child out of our love,
not out of your disappointment.

1727
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:12,760
Charles.

1728
01:54:12,888 --> 01:54:15,095
May I see you outside
for a moment?

1729
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:43,616
I don't think Helen would have
wanted you to be alone.

1730
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:54,342
Daddy!

1731
01:54:54,429 --> 01:54:57,171
Daddy!

1732
01:54:57,265 --> 01:54:58,255
Daddy!
