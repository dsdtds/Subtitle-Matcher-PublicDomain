1
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>Hey...</i>

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,240
<i>Maybe you have to let it hurt.</i>

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,560
- What?
- We've got to get going.

4
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Erik?

6
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,080
Erik, come let me show you...

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
Does anybody want eggs?

9
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,440
- ... daily average for an adult...
- Will you please finish eating?

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,880
- I'm not done reading. Thank you.
- Stop it.

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,720
I want them soft boiled.

12
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,680
"On a pipe..."
Dad, what is that? That one.

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,240
- What?
- What is "on a pipe"?

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,640
- Do you have to read out loud?
- Ten teaspoons of added sugar.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,080
- For the average...
- Read quietly, if you have to read.

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,160
- The body needs energy...
- Thank you.

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,680
Please...

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,200
- Can you tell him?
- Eat up, so we can get going.

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,800
- Has anyone seen my gloves?
- Did you check on the shelf?

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
One second...

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,440
- Who put them here?
- I'll answer.

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,840
Don't. It's probably just Grandma.
Go to the car.

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
- Hurry up.
- Yeah, relax.

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,880
- Do you have the present?
- What? No!

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,280
- Jonas!
- What would you do without me?

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,280
Rock, scissors, paper.
Best of three.

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,720
- Come on, best of five!
- Okay, best of five.

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,560
Quit stalling. Get in the car!

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,360
Rock, scissors, paper...

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,280
- Let's go.
- Loser.

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,640
Shut up.

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,160
Take this.

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,720
- Can't you handle some music?
- No, not right now. Turn it off.

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Did you hear that, Dad?
He can't handle some music.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,920
But you can, right? You and me
are real men, unlike Jonas.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,880
- Take it easy.
- You're full of smack.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,320
Tell him to stop.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,840
- Jonas can't handle some music.
- Shut up.

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,680
- You are so juvenile.
- Really?

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Yes.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,960
- Anyone voting against it?
- I do.

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,680
- Dad?
- What?

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,520
When you sit up front,
you control the radio, right?

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,040
- Yeah, but not all the time.
- Well, I think so anyway.

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,200
NINE MONTHS LATER

46
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Jonas?

47
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,800
Hello? Hello?

48
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,560
Dad, we need to buy groceries.

49
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,920
Dad. Dad?

50
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,160
Dad? Dad!

51
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Dad!

52
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,400
- Would you like one?
- No, I don't want any.

53
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,520
- And how did this happen?
- Well, I...

54
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,640
I really don't know.

55
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,360
Let me check your pupils.

56
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm not actually sick.

57
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,040
Right. Try to rest a bit.
I'll be back in a while.

58
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,160
- Jonas. Jonas?
- What?

59
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
Are you sure
you don't want your pajamas?

60
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
No, that's okay, Grandma.

61
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,840
- We can stop by and pick them up.
- We'll pick up his things tomorrow.

62
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,480
You try to get some sleep now.

63
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,000
I read in your file that
you are an eye doctor.

64
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,240
How long
have you worked at St. Erik's?

65
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,000
Since 1995.

66
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,280
And you prescribed Citalopram
and Benzo for yourself?

67
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,200
Things kind of got to me...

68
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,600
Of course, you know to be careful
when mixing those two medicines.

69
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,240
The combination
can have an undesired effect.

70
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,240
- Can I sign you out today?
- Sure.

71
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,160
I recommend you take it easy.
Let yourself rest.

72
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,160
Get a change of scenery, take
a trip, visit your summer house?

73
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
Okay.

74
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,920
Take care of yourself.

75
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,000
- Have some more gravy.
- I've already taken some.

76
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,840
It's fine. This was delicious.
Really delicious.

77
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,640
We have apple pie
with vanilla sauce for dessert.

78
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,880
Oops.

79
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
Lasse! Come on in.

80
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,520
So, you're already up on your feet.

81
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
- Is Jonas awake?
- No. He's sleeping.

82
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,120
- Hello.
- Hi.

83
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,280
Pack your stuff, we're leaving.

84
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,960
Is that really wise?
I mean, in your condition.

85
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
Let's have coffee and discuss this.

86
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,880
That's very kind of you,
but we have a ferry to catch.

87
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,240
- Ingegerd, make some coffee.
- Tea's almost ready.

88
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,520
I appreciate your concern, Sven.
But I don't want to discuss this.

89
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
Jonas can stay with us
as long as necessary.

90
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,640
- I'm not here to discuss.
- So you can rest.

91
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,040
- Jonas. Get ready.
- Don't be unreasonable.

92
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,040
Jonas, get ready.

93
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
Here's the tea.

94
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,040
Is that Jonas?

95
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,440
I didn't recognize you.
You've grown.

96
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes.

97
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,840
- Hello, Lasse!
- Hi, Lage.

98
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,280
- Welcome!
- Thanks.

99
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,200
- You want help with the bags?
- No, we're fine.

100
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,000
- Are you sure? I have a cart.
- No, no.

101
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,520
- Okay, we'll see you later. Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,520
- What's the matter?
- What?

103
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,440
Do you have everything?
There's clean sheets downstairs.

104
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,240
Okay.

105
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,280
Okay, good. Good.

106
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,080
Good.
Take the vacuum upstairs.

107
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
It's amazing how fast it gets dirty.

108
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,080
You should have seen the
dust bunnies behind the stove.

109
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
My, my...

110
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,680
Thanks for dinner.

111
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,920
That's it? You've barely tasted it!

112
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
I wasn't really that hungry.

113
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
We'll go shopping tomorrow, right?

114
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,800
What a morning.

115
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,560
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to fix the rowboat.

116
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,400
Do you know how to do that?

117
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,480
It just needs some scraping.
And a little paint.

118
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Uh-huh...

119
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,560
Wouldn't that be fun?

120
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,320
Fixing the boat?

121
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,040
No. To go sailing. Or fishing.

122
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
- Wake up!
- Huh?

123
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
You could have
burned down the whole house!

124
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,000
What time is it?

125
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,440
- What are you reading?
- The Phantom.

126
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,320
Is it any good?

127
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,440
Mmm...

128
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,880
"The ghost who walks."At times
he travels like an ordinary man."

129
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,160
Didn't he have a dog?

130
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,320
Mmm... Devil.

131
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,480
Devil is a wolf.

132
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,480
That's right. Devil.
What a name for a dog.

133
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,040
Don't stay up too late reading.

134
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
Well, damn it.
I know I have one left.

135
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,640
- I'll have to look in the back again.
- Thanks.

136
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
Hey there, Doc!

137
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,680
- Well, hi!
- I had no idea you were here.

138
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,520
Yeah, we came... the other day.

139
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,880
I see. Is Jonas with you, too?

140
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,160
- Yes.
- Great!

141
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,200
Then he can play with Axel.
Well, not "play," but...

142
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,440
- I knew I had one left.
- Great.

143
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,760
Just remember one thing...

144
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,240
You need to scrape
all the crap off the boat first.

145
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,960
- He doesn't know this stuff.
- He does now!

146
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,240
Be thorough.
Make sure it's all gone.

147
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,240
Now he knows how to do it.

148
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,360
- Thanks.
- Hello.

149
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,520
Hello.

150
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
They arrived the other day.

151
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,640
Midsummer? Why don't you come
over and we'll do something?

152
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,280
Yeah, thanks.

153
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,320
- Are we having a barbecue?
- Yeah.

154
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,960
Yes, I'll go see if I can...

155
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,760
But...

156
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,360
- They've only got pork chops.
- I'll be right there.

157
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,080
We'll see you
on Midsummer's Eve.

158
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,520
Do you always swim
with your shirt on?

159
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,800
What?

160
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,360
Damn, it's so beautiful.

161
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,320
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

162
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,120
I thought I was the only one
who knew about this spot.

163
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Oh...

164
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,760
God, this is so nice.

165
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
How old are you?

166
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,160
Seventeen.

167
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,400
So you're a junior this fall?

168
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,920
No, sophomore.
I kind of fell behind.

169
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,560
I see...

170
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,440
My friend had to repeat a grade.

171
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,640
She got meningitis or something.
Talk about bad luck.

172
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,440
- Damn it! Do you have a watch?
- No.

173
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,200
I have to work. Damn.

174
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,280
- Helena.
- Lena?

175
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,800
Helena. With an H.

176
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,040
Ah. Jonas, with a J.

177
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,560
Okay, Jonas with a J.

178
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,800
With a J.

179
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,240
See you.

180
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,800
"Hello. Jonas with a J."
Jonas with a J...

181
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm such an idiot.

182
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,600
What did you do today?

183
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,600
What? Oh, nothing special.

184
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,280
Oh, I ran into Simon. Axel is here.
He'd like you to come over.

185
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,200
Okay.

186
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,600
About the other day...

187
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,760
Can't we try and make
the most of this summer?

188
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,360
Hello!

189
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,520
Hi!

190
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,400
You like fish?

191
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,240
Yeah. Thanks.

192
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,560
Good, isn't it?

193
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,560
Yeah.

194
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,640
- You're here with your dad, right?
- Yeah.

195
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,080
I'm renting a shack from my boss.

196
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,720
- But it's not that bad.
<i>- Helena! The cash register!</i>

197
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,000
- I'm on my lunch break!
<i>- You can have it later.</i>

198
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,920
<i>- Helena!</i>
- Yes, all right!

199
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,440
Want to go swimming some day?

200
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,280
- Yeah, sure.
- Cool.

201
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,560
- I thought you quit?
- No. Oh, hi!

202
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,520
I didn't hear you arrive.

203
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,600
- It's looking great.
- Yeah.

204
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,800
Would you like something?

205
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,480
- Cold drink, coffee?
- No.

206
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,360
- A beer?
- No, I'm fine.

207
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,920
- I'm not interrupting, am I?
- No.

208
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,160
It was really unexpected
to meet you the other day.

209
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,440
- I didn't know you were coming.
- No...

210
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,480
I hope you didn't think
I acted strangely.

211
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,680
- I don't know what got into me.
- No, that's okay.

212
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,360
- Jonas has gotten so big.
- Yes.

213
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,680
How's it going?

214
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,240
It was difficult at first, but I'm
getting the hang of it now.

215
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,920
No, I mean for you and Jonas.

216
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,360
Oh, that's just fine.

217
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
If you want to talk...

218
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,960
- Okay...
- Okay.

219
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,200
Simon is waiting.

220
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,520
- See you on Midsummer's.
- Yes.

221
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,840
- Say hi for me.
- I will.

222
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,160
<i>Hold your breath, and feel the
tension in your hand and chest.</i>

223
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
<i>Feel the tension...</i>

224
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,360
<i>And breathe out,
relaxing your left hand completely</i>

225
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,280
<i>and the rest of your body.</i>

226
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,520
<i>Feel the pleasant contrast</i>

227
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,040
<i>of your body
relaxing and getting heavy.</i>

228
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
Uh...

229
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,200
ERIK

230
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
MOTHER

231
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,320
- Hello.
- Hi!

232
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,440
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, I just got here.

233
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,800
Okay.

234
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,640
Come on!

235
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,560
It's really cold! Come on!

236
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,400
Yeah, I'm coming.

237
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,760
Okay...

238
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,600
Last one to that cliff is a... wimp.

239
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,880
Stop it!

240
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,680
Help!

241
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,920
- I let you win, you know!
- Yeah, right.

242
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,160
- Does it hurt?
- What?

243
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,160
- The knee.
- No. Sometimes.

244
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,720
Well, you swim like a fish.

245
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I remember...

246
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,280
When I broke my arm I had to
wear a plastic bag over the cast.

247
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,920
I'd swim around with this
huge bag. I looked so stupid.

248
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,200
Hey...

249
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,240
Didn't you have a brother?

250
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,800
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
- It's all right.

251
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,040
That's so like me.
I just say stuff without thinking.

252
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,520
He died in a car accident.

253
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,520
Maybe you already knew that.

254
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,560
No... Jonas.

255
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,040
Jonas, wait!

256
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,360
What's the matter?

257
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,560
What are you doing?

258
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,760
- I'm packing up.
- Stop it and listen to me!

259
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,400
We have to be able to
talk to each other, Jonas.

260
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,640
- I want to leave. I hate this place!
- I don't care.

261
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,160
Wait!

262
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,120
Jonas!

263
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
- Bye.
- Bye.

264
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,720
Are you going somewhere?

265
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,760
Going somewhere?

266
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,600
No...

267
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,080
About last time... I'm really sorry.

268
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,040
I mean... I apologize.

269
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,360
- Do you want some help?
- No, it's fine.

270
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,120
We used to rent a cottage here
when I was little.

271
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,440
I don't remember where, but...

272
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,560
My Mom used to say
that I took my first steps here.

273
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,800
I see...

274
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,320
You should have seen me then.
I was the world's chubbiest baby.

275
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,920
I was so fat they had to cut my
underwear around the legs

276
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,400
because my thighs were so fat.

277
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,560
- Hard to believe now, isn't it?
- Yeah.

278
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
I'll get it.

279
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,080
Hello, this is Jonas.

280
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,080
Hi!

281
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,640
- Playing backgammon with Dad.
- Who is it?

282
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,680
Nothing special.

283
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
I see...

284
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,600
Okay.

285
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Okay, I will.

286
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,600
Good. Bye, bye.

287
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,760
- Who was that?
- That was Grandma.

288
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,960
They're coming tomorrow
on the ferry at 11.

289
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,600
Grandma said they're
bringing their own bed linen.

290
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,320
- Hi...
- Hi, Grandma.

291
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,800
- Hi, Grandpa!
- Hi...

292
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,520
Hello, welcome.
Happy Midsummer!

293
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Thank you.

294
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,640
- Welcome.
- Thank you, Lars.

295
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,720
- We haven't inconvenienced you?
- Don't be silly.

296
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,960
We called,
but you never answered.

297
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,200
Jonas, grab Grandpa's bag.

298
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,040
- Have you been baking, Lasse?
- Yes, indeed.

299
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,200
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

300
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,120
I forgot the coffee!

301
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,200
- What have you two been doing?
- Nothing much.

302
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,240
Have you played with those boys?

303
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,200
Whatever they were called?
The ones on the cape.

304
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,520
- Kihlbom?
- That's right.

305
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,120
- No.
- Okay...

306
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,640
I have to ask you
to run down to Karlsson's store.

307
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,400
- Do I have to?
- There's no sour cream.

308
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,240
What do you think
Grandpa would say?

309
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,400
Herring without sour cream
for Midsummer's Eve?

310
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,000
There's still some work to do.

311
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,680
I'm gonna put a little varnish on it...

312
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,280
You need to tar it.

313
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,120
The hull. Plenty of tar
and it will float wonderfully.

314
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes.

315
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,400
- Tar.
- Yes.

316
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,840
Thank you, that's enough.

317
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,985
Lars?

318
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,800
No, thanks. I'm good.

319
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,040
You can't celebrate Midsummer's
Eve without a schnapps.

320
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,360
- Maybe he doesn't want any.
- Of course he does, don't be silly.

321
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
It's Midsummer, everyone
wants schnapps. Right, Lars?

322
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,920
Of course. Thanks.

323
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,080
Midsummer without schnapps?
Well, I never...

324
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,880
Finally,
something to wet the whistle.

325
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,960
<i>I have a bad headache</i>

326
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,600
<i>My eyes are stinging</i>

327
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,760
<i>Tummy is rumbling</i>

328
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,920
<i>The night is stumbling</i>

329
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
<i>And down the throat it goes</i>

330
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,240
<i>Moonshine, a drop or so</i>

331
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,120
<i>Praises to our spirits</i>

332
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,360
<i>Praise now our spirits</i>

333
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,040
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

334
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,000
Damn, that's good.

335
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,720
That was beautiful, Grandpa.

336
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,120
- And one more time.
- Yes, indeed.

337
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,360
Erik hated herring.

338
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,480
To him, herring and potatoes
was the worst.

339
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,320
Mom always had to make sausage
for him. Remember that, Dad?

340
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:22,000
<i>See the star in the blue?
Take a sip and you'll see two!</i>

341
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

342
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,920
- Hi.
- Hi!

343
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,280
- I look nice, right?
- Yeah.

344
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,000
- Are you here on your own?
- No.

345
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,640
"The little frogs..."

346
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,320
Hey.
Want to forget about this?

347
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,760
Come!

348
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,520
- There you are.
- Thanks.

349
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,960
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

350
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,960
Happy Midsummer.

351
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,880
- Shall we dance?
- Absolutely!

352
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,480
- Have you seen Jonas?
- Yes, he left with a girl.

353
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,400
Whoa!

354
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,480
Cut it out! Excuse me...

355
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,240
Sorry...

356
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,720
Nice.

357
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,440
- Hey?
- Yeah?

358
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,880
Do you believe in God?

359
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,360
That we go to heaven
when we die?

360
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,480
I don't know.

361
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,120
Maybe.

362
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
When I think about it,
I want to believe, but...

363
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,680
I don't know.

364
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,040
I believe in one God,
the Father Almighty!

365
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:35,440
Creator of Heaven and Earth!

366
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,560
- Are you confirmed?
- Yes.

367
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,320
I got a watch and a gift certificate
for a hardware store.

368
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,880
- Cool.
- Well, not really...

369
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,600
I am quite confirmed, too.
It shows, doesn't it?

370
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,080
- Do something!
- Lars!

371
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,040
Come on, Doc.
Time to go home.

372
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,120
- Come on.
- You are boring. So boring.

373
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,800
- Lasse...
- So boring...

374
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,080
Yes, I know.

375
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,880
I love you.

376
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,920
which would be... typical.

377
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,040
- This is where I live.
- Oh.

378
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,320
- Nice, isn't it?
- Yeah...

379
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,120
Bye! See you.

380
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,400
Yeah. Bye.

381
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,880
Jonas?

382
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,880
Come, sit down.

383
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,880
Well...

384
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,200
Grandma and I think you
should come with us tomorrow.

385
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,560
We feel it would be
better for everyone...

386
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,720
if you move in with us for a while.

387
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,600
I understand if you don't agree.

388
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,280
But we think it's best for you
and for your father's well-being.

389
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,840
This can't go on. Your father
isn't well. He needs help.

390
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,400
Go to bed now.

391
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,640
We're getting up early
in the morning.

392
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,160
Morning!

393
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,080
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

394
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,120
- Anyone want some coffee?
- I'll make the coffee.

395
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,520
Not a problem.

396
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,760
Are you leaving so soon?
Aren't we taking a walk?

397
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,000
Lars...

398
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,400
Don't take this the wrong way,
but we have to talk.

399
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,240
Am I the only one eating now?

400
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,720
You need help.
Professional help, Lars.

401
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,280
Someone got up
on the wrong side of the bed.

402
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,040
We feel that
Jonas should come home with us.

403
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,640
It will give you time to rest
in peace and quiet.

404
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,920
Is that yours, Jonas?

405
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,160
Don't you see? You can't take
care of yourself or anyone else.

406
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,560
If I was still practicing medicine,
I'd commit you immediately.

407
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,680
- All right...
- Does anyone want some coffee?

408
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,760
We've already spoken with Jonas.
He'll gladly come with us.

409
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
Wait a minute...

410
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,960
Is that true, Jonas? Huh?

411
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,560
Jonas! Answer me, dammit!

412
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,440
- Leave him alone!
- Don't yell like that.

413
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,600
Listen, Sven...

414
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,640
You've never listened to
another person your whole life.

415
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,240
You only see and hear
exactly what you already know.

416
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,600
- The boy needs security.
- He needs his father.

417
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,560
He shouldn't need
to worry that...

418
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,760
you'll burn down the house
or slit your wrists.

419
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,080
Stop it, Sven.

420
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,800
Or overdose in a pathetic attempt
to numb your own self-pity.

421
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,840
And what good is it
to split up this family again?

422
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,800
Haven't we endured enough pain?

423
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,160
- The boy needs to rely on his dad.
- But he does!

424
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,440
We only want
what's best for the boy.

425
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,720
Let me tell you something, Sven.

426
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:01,640
I am Jonas' guardian.
I decide in this house.

427
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,600
No outsider is going to come here
and try to run my life

428
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,240
or Jonas' life! Is that clear?

429
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,560
We'll see about that.

430
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,200
- Are you threatening me?
- We both know how the law works.

431
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,400
The child's welfare comes first!

432
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,640
Stop it!

433
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,720
- Promise you'll call every day?
- I promise.

434
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,000
Take care of yourself.

435
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,960
Hello?

436
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Hi!

437
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Hi. I knocked, but no one...

438
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,320
I didn't even know there was a piano.

439
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,560
- You want coffee?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

440
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,600
Good, I didn't have any anyway.

441
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,320
Have you been playing long?

442
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,840
No, just for a few minutes.

443
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,320
- I didn't mean just now.
- Oh.

444
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,040
No. For a while.

445
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,080
I played a flute
in third grade, or something.

446
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,960
All that came out of it
was a lot of squeaking.

447
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,160
It was my mom
who taught me to play.

448
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,320
Was she talented?

449
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,040
Yes, she was.

450
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,520
You miss her, don't you?

451
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,560
Jonas?

452
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,720
- Wait, I'll check. Have you got it?
- Yes.

453
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,440
- Okay, let it down.
- Easy.

454
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,680
That's a damn leaky hulk...

455
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,200
Yes, yes...

456
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,280
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

457
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,360
I was just saying that...

458
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,240
When you were expecting Jonas,
how happy we were for you.

459
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,560
And jealous, remember that?

460
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,520
You...

461
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,720
never really
think anything could happen.

462
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,720
I know I'm a prankster...

463
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,240
I've always been
the clown of the class.

464
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,000
But that's how I handle
my anxiety, my demons.

465
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,560
You have to find your way, Lasse.
This can't go on. It won't work.

466
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,640
You have to find a way
to move on.

467
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,560
Well!

468
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,880
What a crappy boat.
That's what it is.

469
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,280
Good luck with the rowboat!

470
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,520
Hi!

471
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,840
I brought lunch.

472
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,080
I've lost all feeling in my fingers.

473
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,280
Shit...

474
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,040
The palm of my hand
is completely numb.

475
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,800
You never think it'll happen to you.

476
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,920
You read it in the paper
and flip past it.

477
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,480
But I didn't stand a chance.

478
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,400
I know.

479
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,000
When my parents divorced,
I thought it was my fault.

480
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,720
That I had ruined it all.

481
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,800
I've forgotten my mom's cell-phone number.

482
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,040
I used to know it by heart,
but I can't remember it any more.

483
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,920
What do you remember?

484
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,320
I remember that Dad was driving.

485
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,880
We were on the way to
visit Grandma and Grandpa.

486
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,880
It was really cold that day.

487
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,280
Erik and I were fighting, as usual.

488
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,080
What did you fight about?

489
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,000
Who would get to ride shotgun.

490
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:39,000
I said it was my turn
on the way home when we...

491
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,040
when we crashed.

492
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,560
If I had been up front,
everything would have been...

493
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,680
Would have been what?

494
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,160
- Erik would have survived.
- But you would have died.

495
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,560
I should have won.
I always won.

496
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,840
You haven't told
this to anyone, have you?

497
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,560
No.

498
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,200
Not even your dad?

499
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,800
We don't talk to each other.

500
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,200
Not at all?

501
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,080
Not about this.

502
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,160
Why not?

503
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,160
You don't know my dad.
He wouldn't understand.

504
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,520
How can you know that
if you haven't even tried?

505
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,520
What do you want from me? Really?

506
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,480
Why do you ask so many questions?

507
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,760
Because I care about you.

508
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,320
That's bullshit, and you know it.
You just pity me!

509
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,960
- No, I don't!
- I can see how you look at me!

510
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,320
How everyone looks at me.
But nobody dares to say anything.

511
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,680
Jonas? Jonas!

512
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,960
Jonas!

513
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,280
- You sailed from Marstrand today?
- Yes, indeed.

514
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,200
I set the GPS and just...

515
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,760
- Hi.
- Hi.

516
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,520
Hi.

517
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,080
Well, hell! So you're upright today?

518
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,440
I'm sorry. Let me introduce you.

519
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,400
This is Lasse. These are
my friends Henrik and Karin.

520
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,680
And there's Lasse,
sitting there like a buffoon.

521
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,265
Huh?

522
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,800
He's about to give the wedding toast,
and he's sitting with

523
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:08,200
steak, gravy, and potatoes
all over his tuxedo.

524
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,640
Huh?

525
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,600
But cheers anyway.

526
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,160
Cheers.

527
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,400
I bet Simon didn't behave
any better at your wedding.

528
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

529
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,440
Everyone stares at me
when I'm in the store...

530
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,160
I smell their damned clothes
every single damned day!

531
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,240
Sorry...

532
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,280
Time doesn't heal all wounds.
That's just the way it is. Sorry.

533
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,440
I'll take care of it.

534
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,120
- You get the little one.
- Thanks.

535
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,080
A toast. To all the idiots...

536
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,360
May they rot in hell.

537
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

538
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,400
That's tasty...

539
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,960
Especially with the bits of cork.

540
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,520
- Come!
- Where are we going?

541
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,760
Come.

542
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,280
- Your turn.
- You must be joking.

543
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,160
Yes!

544
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,360
Bravo.

545
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,120
That was nice, wasn't it?

546
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,120
Yeah, that was damn nice.

547
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,480
Help!

548
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,040
Help!

549
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,920
- Been swimming?
- No, no.

550
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,560
- He can't swim.
- Who?

551
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,680
Gunnarson. He can't swim.

552
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,360
A fisherman who can't swim...

553
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,440
- Dad?
- I guess he never learned.

554
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,160
Why don't we ever talk about Mom and Erik?

555
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,800
- What? We do, don't we?
- No.

556
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,000
We talk about them all the time.

557
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,240
No, we don't.

558
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,160
You never say Mom or mentions Erik's name.

559
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,720
It's as if they never existed.

560
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,800
Why did you do that, Dad?

561
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,400
Did what?

562
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,200
Jonas, it's...

563
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,880
It's hard to explain.

564
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,400
What did you think
would happen to me?

565
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,000
Did that cross your mind?

566
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,760
Please. Please, Jonas.
You don't understand.

567
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,360
You are a coward.

568
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,800
You only think about yourself.

569
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,600
How old was your brother?

570
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,960
Eleven. Almost twelve.

571
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,000
Did you get along well?

572
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,200
Yeah, sometimes.

573
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,400
No, actually. We fought all the time.

574
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,400
Weird how you can fight over nothing.

575
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,760
That's exactly what people fight over.
Nothing.

576
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,080
I wish I'd had someone
to fight with sometimes.

577
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,400
- Does that help?
- Yes, I think it does.

578
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,840
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

579
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,840
I've always loved this house.

580
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,640
It's so still and quiet here.

581
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,520
And the sea...

582
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,800
No neighbors to stick their noses
in your business.

583
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,120
How are you and Simon
doing, really?

584
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:56,480
You know Simon. He can't
talk about anything of importance.

585
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,840
And he's a terrible dancer.

586
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,305
Well...

587
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,960
You can't blame yourself
for what happened.

588
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,760
It wasn't anyone's fault.
You know that.

589
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,200
Yeah, but Jonas thinks it is.

590
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,400
Stop blaming yourself.
That leads nowhere.

591
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,880
- I think he hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.

592
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,680
- He says he hates me.
- He says it, but he doesn't mean it.

593
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,600
He hates what happened, not you.

594
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,000
During the first World War, when
the men lay in their bunkers...

595
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:54,000
nearly all of them became
religious and prayed for survival.

596
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,560
Sometimes, I think that...

597
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,560
That it...

598
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,560
I think that maybe
it would help, sometimes.

599
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,520
I don't understand
a God damn thing of all this.

600
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,360
It's very, very empty.

601
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,160
That's the way it is.

602
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:30,680
Are you sad now?

603
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,560
I can't help it.

604
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,160
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

605
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,400
Come on, Jonas.
I can tell from looking at you.

606
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,440
You're about to fall apart.

607
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,440
- It's not so fucking easy.
- Who said it was supposed to be?

608
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,800
- You don't get it anyway.
- No...

609
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,800
Just that you feel like shit.

610
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,400
And that you aren't
doing anything about it.

611
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,840
You're a coward, Jonas.

612
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,800
Just like your Dad.

613
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:28,160
Go to hell! You don't know how
I feel! Nobody knows how I feel!

614
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,120
You don't know what it's like
to watch your little brother die.

615
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,160
You don't know what
it's like to lose your mom.

616
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,640
You don't know a damn thing.

617
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,200
Hey...

618
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,000
Maybe you have to let it hurt...

619
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,040
Here!

620
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,880
Want to hear a really great song?

621
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,280
Yeah, sure.

622
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,920
Have you heard this one?

623
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,800
- Loverboy!
- What?

624
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,160
Come on!

625
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,240
- I can't.
- This is nothing. Get a grip.

626
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,120
Come on!

627
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,680
- Come!
- Here?

628
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,080
- Yes!
- No, no... I can't even dance.

629
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:46,040
Stop! No excuses. Up with you!

630
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:52,600
Okay, stand here.
And move a little like this.

631
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,280
Dance! Do what you want!
You're driving me crazy!

632
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,000
- I can't...
- Get a grip! Shush!

633
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,280
Come on!

634
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,480
<i>Where you can play football,
swim, and barbecue.</i>

635
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,680
<i>We remind you
that this is a smoke-free cabin.</i>

636
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,040
<i>If you'd like to smoke,
please go outside the cabin.</i>

637
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,080
<i>Please go out mid-air, that
makes it difficult to get there.</i>

638
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:00,800
<i>First mate Jonas wants to note
the emergency exits in the front,</i>

639
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,520
<i>in the back, and over the wings.
Back to you.</i>

640
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:09,440
<i>For lunch today we'll have
mashed potatoes, meatballs,</i>

641
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,960
<i>and some vegetables.</i>

642
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,080
Shit...

643
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,880
<i>Is that okay? We have a menu...</i>

644
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,440
Dad!

645
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,920
<i>where you
can buy some snacks.</i>

646
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,800
<i>Like sandwiches made by first mate Jonas.</i>

647
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,680
Axel, come here.

648
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,120
- What's the matter, Mom?
- Come here...

649
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,520
Ouch, damn it!

650
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,840
Ow...

651
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,160
What happened?

652
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,080
- Let me see.
- I don't know.

653
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,520
But what happened...

654
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,480
Hi.

655
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,440
Ow! Damn it!

656
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,240
- Fuck...
- Lasse?

657
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,200
- Are you out of your mind?
- Shut the fuck up.

658
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,920
- Are you all right, Lasse?
- It hurts.

659
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,760
I've tried to talk to you
for 15 years, Simon.

660
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,200
But you can't.
You don't know how.

661
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,200
You just sweep
everything under the rug.

662
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,800
I needed someone...
who can touch me.

663
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,160
I need someone to talk with.

664
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,560
Can you understand that?

665
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,720
Every time a...

666
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,640
a patient...

667
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,600
asks the doctor how things are...

668
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,000
you're supposed to say
"One day at a time."

669
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,360
"One day at a time, Mrs. Larsson."

670
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:55,600
One more day...

671
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,160
And so this is what I think...

672
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:04,480
"Now, today will be a good day."

673
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,480
"I have to look ahead."

674
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,920
But I can't.

675
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,080
I can't do it.
I don't know how to do that.

676
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,640
Hey...

677
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,040
Explain it to me.
Please. Please, explain it

678
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,760
What's wrong? Jonas, listen!

679
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,360
What have I done wrong?

680
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,040
Tell me! What have I done wrong?
What did I do wrong?

681
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,480
Everything is your fault!

682
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,400
It's your fault Mom and Erik died!

683
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,520
What?

684
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,760
It's your fault Mom and Erik died!

685
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,080
- Calm down!
- It's your fault I'm a cripple!

686
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,680
- I hate you!
- No!

687
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,400
- Yes!
- No!

688
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,600
<i>- Jonas can't handle some music</i>.
- <i>You are so juvenile</i>.

689
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,280
<i>It's your fault!</i>

690
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,320
<i>What have I done wrong?</i>

691
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:15,120
<i>Rock, paper, scissors...</i>

692
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,000
<i>It wasn't my fault.</i>

693
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,360
<i>Dad!</i>

694
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,480
<i>Dad!</i>

695
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,840
<i>It wasn't anyone's fault.</i>

696
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,400
Dad!

697
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,880
Jonas...

698
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,120
I love you.

699
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,880
I love you, too.

700
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,080
Come here...

701
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,200
There, there...

702
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,160
