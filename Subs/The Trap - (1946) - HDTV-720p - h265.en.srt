1
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,469
We just flew in from Seattle.
Is there anything you can do?

2
00:00:41,553 --> 00:00:42,971
This is a Michelin-rated restaurant.

3
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:45,265
We don't have any reservations
for six months.

4
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:49,561
Mr. Ridley. What a wonderful surprise.

5
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,146
The maitre d' will seat you right away.

6
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:53,440
Marcel. Table six for Mr. Ridley.

7
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:54,899
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

8
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,444
What the hell? He just walked in here
without a reservation.

9
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:59,696
When you're The New York Times
food critic,

10
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,072
you can too.

11
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:13,459
There you are, sir.

12
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,008
That's me. Sonny Jones.

13
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,843
Doing what I love to do.

14
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:24,429
At one of the best restaurants
in New Orleans.

15
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:27,682
Now I'm about to tell you
an unbelievable story

16
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,684
that just happens to be true.

17
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,519
Chef, I have a slight issue.

18
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:33,229
Can't you see, I'm busy.

19
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:36,232
Bernard Ridley was just seated
at table 67.

20
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:41,488
All right, all right,
ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:43,239
Let's look alive, everybody!

22
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,408
We got The New York Times
in the house tonight

23
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:47,035
and you will not embarrass me.

24
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,411
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Chef!

25
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,039
- That bechamel. I need it now.
- Coming up!

26
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,583
Mmm.

27
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,960
My oysters. Where are they?

28
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,880
They should have been staring at
my pretty face about 30 seconds ago.

29
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,674
I've come a long way since my days

30
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:03,009
cleaning grease traps in my family's
fried chicken joint

31
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,511
back in Atlanta.

32
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,054
One thing that hasn't changed

33
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:07,681
is my love for food.

34
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,892
Yeah. That's the shit right there.

35
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:40,672
Come on, people.

36
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,688
- Hey.
- Hey! Spick and span.

37
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,398
You leaving straight from here?

38
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,733
Yeah, yeah, Chef.
I'm leaving straight from here.

39
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:03,528
Driving overnight.
Playing Midnight Train To Georgia.

40
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,239
You know Pops said that was the…

41
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,032
That's the only way a man
should arrive in the state.

42
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:09,492
That's right.

43
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,871
Was great work tonight.

44
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:15,540
Thanks to you we'll be getting
a great write-up in the Times.

45
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:17,667
Oh. Well, Chef, I'm…

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,252
I'm just executing your vision.

47
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:20,670
Mmm, yeah, well…

48
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:23,715
Think it's time we started
executing yours.

49
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,510
We're opening up a Bentley's
in Los Angeles.

50
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:28,594
No!

51
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,096
LA?

52
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,557
- And I want you to be Head Chef.
- You…

53
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,560
- Me?
- That's right.

54
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,145
No. LA?

55
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:39,189
I mean… I mean, of course!

56
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:40,732
Hell, yeah!

57
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:43,276
- Man, that's a dream.
- All right, good.

58
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,695
Now, go and enjoy
the time with your family.

59
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:48,198
'Cause when you get back,
it's gonna be full steam ahead.

60
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,908
You damn right it is.

61
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,117
Full steam straight ahead.

62
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,869
So much steam you ain't gonna
know what to do with it.

63
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:53,897
All right now.

64
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:54,954
Don't you drink yourself to death

65
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:56,539
before you can give me my promotion.

66
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,249
- I need you alive. You hear me?
- Have a safe trip.

67
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:24,692
Hey, old ass nigga.

68
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,361
You're gonna give me a second?
What's up, man?

69
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:28,238
Hey, you need to have some patience.

70
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,116
Where your sister at?

71
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,702
Yeah, she told me you and some other bitch

72
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,496
tried to use her credit card
and book a trip.

73
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:37,789
Me and another bitch.

74
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:40,083
She told me I shouldn't be
fucking with your old ass anyway.

75
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,501
You still on that bullshit?

76
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:43,545
No, nigga. No, no, no.

77
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,463
I wanna… This a dub sack.

78
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,840
Ain't no motherfucking ten.

79
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,925
Nigga, that's your problem,
you can't count.

80
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,344
Your ass need to be in school.

81
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,554
Nigga, it's Sunday.

82
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,597
Sunday school. Monday school.

83
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,682
Nigga, go to school.

84
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,976
You and your little nasty ass
sister need Jesus.

85
00:04:58,059 --> 00:04:59,477
Hey, man. Fuck you, bro!

86
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,895
Yeah, nigga. Fuck you!

87
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,689
- Old ass nigga.
- Aye!

88
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:06,150
I'll let you get this if you
let me smoke you out. Aye!

89
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,361
Hey, there goes the old rat,
beaten ass Dutch, man.

90
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,738
That could be the worst
drug dealer ever, bro.

91
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,283
Look at it though. How the hell he sell
all the goddamn dope

92
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,993
but he ain't making no money?

93
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,078
Shut up, you.
At least he got a goddamn job.

94
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,330
Robbing is my job, big head little boy.

95
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:21,165
Yeah, if you get paid for it.
You ain't never paid for it.

96
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,334
Man, you know, I get paid from robbing.
You know…

97
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:25,712
- You should rob a damn job.
- For real. For real.

98
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,213
Broke ass.

99
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:28,506
This nigga's…
That's daddy, bro.

100
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,216
He rob one motherfucker.

101
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,801
- What you mean?
- You robbing that.

102
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,220
- You do rob…
- Old ass lazy.

103
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,180
I don't give a damn and I took
a handicapped sticker.

104
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,224
VIP airway. Ah.

105
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,444
Check this out. Ah!

106
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,070
Look at that sad ass, man.

107
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:57,160
Hell, no. Light skin, white bread eating
ass Sonny.

108
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:00,788
You got kicked off Top Chef, man?

109
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:04,125
- You know he did.
- That's a golden motherfucker.

110
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,878
See, I haven't been home
in almost a year.

111
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:09,756
I couldn't believe how
run down the place had got.

112
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,967
My granddaddy rolling
in his grave right now.

113
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,887
- We're open but…
- Hello?

114
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,639
Yeah, I don't even have the money
to get my nails done.

115
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:18,973
Actually I just got them done.

116
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,642
Can I get some chicken, please?

117
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,353
Is you deaf? We out of chicken. Damn.

118
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,188
How the hell a Chicken Shack
out of chicken?

119
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:26,814
Like, you always want something.

120
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:28,524
What, y'all just a shack?

121
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:29,692
What, y'all just a shack?

122
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:32,195
If you want some chicken you could
bounce your fake ass ass

123
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:34,030
- over to JJ's.
- And I'm gonna do that

124
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:36,658
- 'cause they make chicken better anyway.
- Hey, baby.

125
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,619
I got a wing for you but
you got to bust it open for your boy.

126
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:41,329
Oh, way, nigga.

127
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:42,830
- Yeah.
- If he don't stop all that…

128
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:44,248
That's right, Uncle Gus.

129
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:45,541
Tell that bitch!

130
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,960
Bust another wing on, boy!

131
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:52,131
- Watch out.
- I'm gonna go holla at my girl.

132
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:53,675
What's up?

133
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:56,594
Wait, boy. I am not coming
to your showcase. Stop asking.

134
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:57,971
- You won't be coming to my showcase…
- No.

135
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,431
- Put a fake ass back boy.
- Fake ass back boy?

136
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,353
Hold it, girl. You're gonna want
this dick when I get rich.

137
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:08,147
You gonna want this dick when I get rich.

138
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,649
What's it look like I'm doing, sir?

139
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:12,026
Not your job. Where's Mama Jay?

140
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:13,945
Who's that? Who are you?

141
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,321
- Where is Mama Jay?
- Who?

142
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,781
Where's the manager?

143
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:18,658
Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on, bitch.

144
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:19,993
Bae!

145
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:22,662
Bae!

146
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:24,455
Who's making
all the goddamn noise?

147
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,291
Hey, Sonny! What's up?

148
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,419
Baby, this my little brother
I was telling you about.

149
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:30,502
Right here, my little brother.

150
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,755
What's going on? What you doing over here?

151
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:35,133
What is going on with Mama's restaurant?
What have you done, man?

152
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:37,010
And who is the ratchet ass
cashier you got watching?

153
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:38,761
- Oh, bitch. Hold up.
- I found her on IG.

154
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:41,514
This is Al Sharpton's
little daughter, man.

155
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:44,350
Who calling motherfucking
ratchet ass waitress, you pissy ass?

156
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:47,020
- Tell me one motherfucking…
- Listen, ma'am. Ma'am.

157
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,272
- Ma'am, this is my family's restaurant.
- Hello?

158
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,733
Okay, that's my man.
This is my man's Chicken Shack.

159
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,735
This is my man's Chicken Shack.

160
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,653
- Come on, man, chill. Hey, chill.
- You don't know the fuck…

161
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:58,114
Come on chill. Chill. Chill. Look.
She'll stab you.

162
00:07:58,197 --> 00:07:59,323
- She will stab you.
- Hello.

163
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:00,742
- I'm letting you know that right now.
- Hello.

164
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:01,909
Now where's Mama…

165
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:03,286
Let's not do this in front of customers.

166
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,912
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, let me walk you out.

167
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:06,330
Let me walk you outside.

168
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:07,874
Mama got sick.
Told me to take charge.

169
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:09,459
Go ahead and fuck it up real good,
ain't you?

170
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,044
Okay, well, you go ahead and do it.

171
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,545
You running around there
with the white people.

172
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,130
You got your nose all up in the air.

173
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,424
Listen, I can't help you here,
man. I have a job.

174
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:18,551
- Quit it, man.
- I can't quit my job.

175
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:22,263
I've got a big promotion out in LA, man.
I got to go and run a restaurant.

176
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:25,099
So, I guess, New Orleans
wasn't far enough, huh?

177
00:08:25,183 --> 00:08:27,727
Hey, listen, man.
Don't start that, Dutch. Okay?

178
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,562
I mean, really, man.
I talked to Mama every week

179
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,522
and she ain't said nothing to me
about being sick.

180
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,650
You know how she is.

181
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:38,362
You know, she ain't gonna tell
nobody she's sick.

182
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,783
But she'd be worried
about your little ass.

183
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,909
You see?

184
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:46,412
- I'm fittin' to go see her.
- Titty-baby. Well, go see her

185
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:48,331
- 'cause I got some business to take care.
- Oh, do you?

186
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:50,041
- Yeah, I got some business too.
- Oh, do you?

187
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,459
Well, why don't you make
this your business?

188
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:52,710
Why don't you make this your business?

189
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:54,420
- Get this together.
- Get your roof fixed.

190
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:56,589
- Huh?
- I'm trying to get the roof fixed on here.

191
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:59,092
Why don't you get the roof, roof, roof,
roof, roof fixed behind the counter.

192
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,843
The plumbing and everything, nigga.

193
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:39,048
Hands on the steering wheel.

194
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:41,384
My hands are already
on the steering wheel.

195
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,636
See, I told you it was him.

196
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,096
Huh?

197
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,431
I'd recognize that big head anywhere.

198
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:50,101
Is that shit supposed to be funny?

199
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:54,063
Y'all can't just be pulling people over
for nothing, yo.

200
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,816
Got me out here all on edge
and I ain't even do shit.

201
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,317
It was her idea to pull you over,

202
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,278
- not mine.
- Shush. Nice.

203
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,571
Real nice.

204
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,032
Mighty Morphin' Powers.

205
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:06,784
How's my favorite white ranger?

206
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,953
- It's Officer Powers now.
- Huh.

207
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:10,872
Almost didn't recognize you
out of uniform.

208
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,415
Where's your apron?

209
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:18,254
Anyway. I see not much has changed
since graduation, huh?

210
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:19,630
You still fine.

211
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,091
So you still doing big things
down in the Big Easy?

212
00:10:22,175 --> 00:10:24,177
Yeah. Little something something.

213
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,597
- Same old Sonny.
- Yeah, hope that's a good thing.

214
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,057
- How long you in town for?
- Couple of days.

215
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:32,393
Couple of days. You know, um…

216
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:35,229
I'mma call you if I can get you
to give me your new number.

217
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:37,732
No. You got my number.

218
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:40,193
- No, I don't.
- 911.

219
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:42,111
Oh.

220
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,529
You're free to go, Sonny.

221
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,489
Mmm-hmm.

222
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:48,951
Stay out of trouble, big head.

223
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,580
Shit.
Any day she could arrest my ass.

224
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:00,379
What the fuck is you doing here?

225
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:02,590
Damn! I thought you was an eclipse.

226
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:04,008
I have you know

227
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:07,011
that KP asked me
to come here personally.

228
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:09,055
Get your fucking ass out of the car.

229
00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:10,723
Thought you was in prison.

230
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:20,066
That's what I'm talking about, man.

231
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:30,993
Whoo!

232
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,204
That was pretty decent right there.

233
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:34,789
Yeah?

234
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:36,499
I got a hand too, KP.

235
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,502
We good?

236
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:41,754
Hey, man, what the…

237
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,008
What the fuck?

238
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,426
Oh, my God!

239
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,594
Shit!

240
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:50,179
Now we're good.

241
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,847
What the hell was that for?

242
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:54,600
Oh, wait. You had next, right?

243
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:57,645
- Come on.
- No, bro. No. No, no, no, no.

244
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,939
- I'm cool, man.
- Is there something wrong with you?

245
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:03,109
I can't do no…
My… My knees is bad.

246
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,569
I got a cold right now.

247
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:08,114
- Should just…
- Oh, yeah. He was short with money.

248
00:12:08,781 --> 00:12:10,449
I'm glad he got one in though.

249
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,160
I don't wanna kill a man over money.

250
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:15,204
- You know what I mean?
- You know, crazy?

251
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,500
How you feel about
taking over his inventory?

252
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:22,878
Oh. Nervous as hell.

253
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,505
Real nervous.

254
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:26,632
- Dutch.
- What?

255
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:29,218
You've been asking me for years
to give you a shot.

256
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,928
I got an opening.

257
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,430
You're not gonna take it?

258
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,181
Look, Dutch.

259
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,183
You can run with the big dogs

260
00:12:37,226 --> 00:12:38,561
or you can stay under the porch.

261
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:40,938
I'm gonna stay under the porch, man.

262
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:43,274
I'm a under-the-porch nigga.

263
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,484
I don't think you get it.

264
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:48,612
Teeny, I don't think he gets it.

265
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,283
Look. You move weight…

266
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:56,203
Or you move nothing

267
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,456
ever again.

268
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,167
There it is.

269
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,878
I don't wanna see your face again.

270
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:06,964
- You hear me?
- Hey, KP.

271
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,051
I ain't seen shit.

272
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,179
Yeah, I know.

273
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,334
Mama!

274
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,759
Ma!

275
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:58,432
Ma?

276
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:10,027
Ma?

277
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,279
Mama!

278
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:14,532
- Oh, no!
- What are you doing in here?

279
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:15,908
What are you doing in here?

280
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:17,451
- Get out!
- Ah!

281
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:19,161
Out!

282
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:22,123
God! Can't do nothing in my own house.

283
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:41,434
Jesus!

284
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,352
That's more like it.

285
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:46,397
Let me find that you out here
fightin' in these streets.

286
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:48,524
You calling me a ho?

287
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,193
Boy, don't make me take off this belt.

288
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:53,028
From the looks of things upstairs,

289
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,489
you've taken off too much already.

290
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:59,827
How come you didn't call
and let me know you were coming up?

291
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,620
I wanted to surprise you.

292
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:03,289
You want some sweet tea?

293
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,000
You know I want some tea,
you don't have to ask me that.

294
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:11,922
So, Mama,

295
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,716
you know I went by the restaurant?

296
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:17,386
It's all run-down.

297
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,140
Well, you know Dutch.
He needs time to figure out things.

298
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:24,310
It seem like he need less time.

299
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:27,646
It's only been three months, they said,
already look like a trap house.

300
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,857
Oh, Sonny, it don't look that bad.

301
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:34,820
- They ran out of chicken, Mama.
- That's my Dutch.

302
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,656
I haven't been over there in a while.

303
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,533
Yes, that's probably part of the problem.

304
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,745
Did Dutch tell you I was sick?

305
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,455
Yes. Yes, he did.

306
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:47,750
And I was wondering
why you didn't say anything.

307
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,043
Well…

308
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,629
Occasionally, I get

309
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,881
a little dizzy,
but I just take some Robitussin.

310
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:57,343
I'm fine.
I mean, nothing to bother you with.

311
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:59,803
Listen, no matter how it may seem,

312
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:01,847
- it's never a bother.
- Mmm-hmm.

313
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:05,267
Do they have you
running that restaurant yet?

314
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:08,270
Now you do know I know
that you're changing the subject

315
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:10,147
- on purpose.
- No… Okay.

316
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:14,026
But, since you asked,
they actually are opening a new restaurant

317
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:16,737
and they asked your boy
to be the Head Chef.

318
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,282
Oh, Sonny, that's amazing!

319
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:23,452
Oh! You know your granddaddy
would be so proud of you.

320
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:27,081
Yes… But what about you?

321
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:30,584
Listen, I told you. I am fine, just fine.

322
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,796
Listen, if I wasn't fine,
would I be able to do this?

323
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,465
- Do what, lady?
- Come here, I can show you

324
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:38,551
better than I can tell you.

325
00:16:54,191 --> 00:16:58,404
- Oh, Sonny, I'm so glad you're home!
- I'm glad to be home.

326
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,864
Oh, hun, you know what?
Dutch needs you to help.

327
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:02,658
Just talk to him.

328
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:03,993
We was having a good time.

329
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,579
- Now you got to bring him up.
- Oh, come on, Sonny.

330
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:08,372
That's your big brother, you know.

331
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,721
Hey, Miss Johnson.

332
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,642
Hey, Miss Johnson.

333
00:17:29,393 --> 00:17:32,187
Oh, hey, guys. Look, it's Sonny.
Hey, Sonny.

334
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:51,915
Hey, Miss Johnson. When are you
gonna let me smell that thing?

335
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,753
Give me my damn ball, man.

336
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:58,172
- You sound crazy as hell.
- Look, I tell you what.

337
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,090
You take a shot from that porch
and you hit it,

338
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:01,467
I give you the whole Chicken Shack.

339
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,719
How the hell you gonna bet
our family restaurant?

340
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:05,971
You see, Mama? This is the shit
I'm talking about, right here.

341
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:08,766
There you go snitching.
He's snitching, Mama. He's snitching.

342
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:12,102
What'd I say? Quit all that cussing!
Shoot the damn ball.

343
00:18:12,186 --> 00:18:13,979
Whose side you on anyway?

344
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,273
Shoot the ball,
and stop acting like a little bitch side,

345
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,484
that's whose side she is.
Shoot the ball, man.

346
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,319
I'm getting sick
of your shit already.

347
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,531
Carry your ass, come on.
I'm done, come on.

348
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:27,034
That old bullshit? That lucky ass shot.

349
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:28,494
Get that shit out of here!

350
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,079
- That was a foul.
- That wasn't no foul, man.

351
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:31,622
I'mma put that hook shot
on your ass, boy.

352
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:32,705
Come on, man.

353
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:35,834
- What's going on with your holy…
- Whoop-whoop!

354
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:37,503
- Wreckx-n-Effect.
- Look at that!

355
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,630
- Rump Shaker-lookin' motherfucker.
- Come on.

356
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:41,048
Mama, he foulin'!

357
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,133
Be a cock right, man.

358
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:44,760
Mama, Mama!

359
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:47,221
It's Mama. Mama, you okay?

360
00:18:47,304 --> 00:18:49,890
Mama, Mama…

361
00:18:50,724 --> 00:18:52,893
- Mama!
- Miss Johnson, call the ambulance!

362
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:55,479
Get up, Mama.

363
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:10,744
I got that dizzy, I just passed out.

364
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:12,079
- Mama.
- Huh?

365
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,831
- You probably got gonorrhea.
- What?

366
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:16,792
They gonna give you some penicillin,
and it's gonna clear it up.

367
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,544
- What?
- Like it did mine.

368
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:20,254
Hey, man, will you just stop talking?

369
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:22,881
The man, Mr. Green, that you was
messing with, down at the club.

370
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,717
Man, why is you talking, man?

371
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,468
Just tellin' that kind of stuff…

372
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,429
He probably the one that gave it to her.

373
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:29,847
I ain't gone out with that man
but one time.

374
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,223
- You tripping, woman.
- Huh?

375
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:33,600
I don't know
what that boy talking about.

376
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:36,103
Listen, y'all quit acting stupid.
That Dr. Phillip gonna come in here.

377
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:37,730
- Consoling my Mama.
- You are not helping.

378
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,648
Okay, you two, shut the fuck up.

379
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,275
Now, you see what you done, made her cuss.

380
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,694
Just be quiet.

381
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,239
Hey, Doc. How's… How's she looking?

382
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:50,159
You mind if I speak with your mother
alone for a minute?

383
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,078
- Yeah.
- No, they can stay.

384
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,458
Miss Jones, um,

385
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,836
we got the results back from your biopsy,
and you tested positive

386
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:03,088
for ductal carcinoma,
it's a form of breast cancer.

387
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:04,798
Oh, no!

388
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,925
Oh, shit!

389
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:08,510
Oh, God.

390
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:11,180
- She gonna die.
- Man, she is not gonna die.

391
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:12,723
Will you pull yourself together?

392
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:16,226
Both of you, shut up
and let this doctor talk!

393
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,063
It's okay. You know,
this can be a little hard to process.

394
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:22,691
Um, but the prognosis is good.

395
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:25,360
- Jesus, that's good.
- See what she said? The prognosis…

396
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:26,779
We just have to keep you

397
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,739
a few more days,
and run some more tests,

398
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,657
and we'll take it from there.

399
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,243
Just a few more days, okay.

400
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,914
All right, if you have any questions,
you can just give me a ring.

401
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:39,208
- Okay.
- How come I didn't get the card?

402
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,211
I'm the big brother.
I'm the one that's supposed to be…

403
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:44,463
- Because I was the closest.
- You want a card?

404
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,256
I don't even want…
I don't even want the card.

405
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:50,344
- You're cute though.
- We're sorry, we're sorry, Doc.

406
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:53,555
- I'll call you though.
- You're wasting the lady's time.

407
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:57,476
Hey, Mama, it's okay.
Look at what you did.

408
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,561
Mama, Mama.

409
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:03,982
I was so scared that she was gonna tell me
I had lung cancer.

410
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:07,528
You can always get some new titties
but you can't get no new lungs!

411
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:08,737
It's gonna be okay.

412
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:10,864
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- I know, baby. I know, Sonny.

413
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,699
I'm gonna kill that old man
that gave you that.

414
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:14,910
You know what?
Get on out of my room, Dutch.

415
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,411
Just go on, get on out of here.

416
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:18,789
I'm gonna be right back.
I gotta… I'll be back.

417
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,500
Why you gotta tell Sonny
some mess like that?

418
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,503
Go on out of here with that mess.
It's mess!

419
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:31,802
Hey, little brother, check this out.

420
00:21:31,885 --> 00:21:35,347
Hey, uh, I was just back here
and I just remembered something.

421
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,475
You remember that time you took
that little raggedy ass towel

422
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,893
and tied it around your neck,

423
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:41,228
acting like it was a cape?

424
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:44,064
Jumped off the roof,
and broke your damn leg.

425
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:45,816
And was sitting up there crying,

426
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,443
and boo-hooing, and snot and shit,
you don't remember that?

427
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:52,739
I mean, I do remember that,
but that was you, Dutch.

428
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,867
It's how… It's how I remember it.

429
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,451
- Yeah.
- That was me?

430
00:21:56,535 --> 00:21:57,911
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was you, bro.

431
00:21:57,995 --> 00:21:59,663
Yeah, it was my right leg.

432
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:01,832
- Yeah.
- Damn, I forgot.

433
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:04,793
I… I smoke too much weed.
Okay, yeah, yeah.

434
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:06,420
But the point I'm trying to make is,

435
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:10,007
we've been through a lot.
You know, Mama's going through some stuff,

436
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,384
and, like I've been telling you this
since we was kids…

437
00:22:14,094 --> 00:22:16,513
It's gonna be all right.
Everything will be all right.

438
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,474
- No, you told me that.
- Yeah.

439
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:22,144
Damn, you just told me
everything was gonna be all right.

440
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:24,605
Yeah. Yeah, man, um,

441
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:26,648
I… I really appreciate you

442
00:22:26,982 --> 00:22:28,400
coming out here,

443
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:30,485
- and trying to tell me something.
- Mmm-hmm.

444
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:32,946
- That I have already told you.
- Mmm-hmm.

445
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,824
- See, that is absolutely genius.
- Mmm-hmm.

446
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:40,329
So, I mean, I already know
it's gonna be okay, bro.

447
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:43,874
- I knew it then, and I know it now.
- You sure?

448
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:47,044
Hey, listen man, were you coming out here
to console me, man?

449
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,296
Because if you're trying to make me
feel better, she's going hard…

450
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:50,881
You know, I just go on
back in there with Mama.

451
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:53,717
- Yeah, well, you just do that.
- Asshole, boy.

452
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,192
Hey… Hey, sir.

453
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:13,111
How you doing?
Yeah, this… Yeah, this is he.

454
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,699
Nah, I don't know.
I don't know when I'll…

455
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:19,993
I don't know
when I'll be able to be there.

456
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:23,205
Well, it's my mother's
health condition, sir,

457
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:26,917
and, unfortunately, she's gonna have…

458
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,169
Uh, yeah, I'll keep you informed.

459
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,797
Yeah, bye.

460
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,507
You keep me laughing.

461
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,468
Twinkies.

462
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:39,221
- They didn't have any chicken.
- Chicken…

463
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:40,681
He'd eat everything.

464
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,770
Oh, you're making it hurt.
Don't make me laugh so hard.

465
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,480
Y'all loud as hell.

466
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:51,608
Hell, I could hear y'all
from the elevator. What'd I miss?

467
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:53,777
Your brother telling me

468
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,864
about how Denzel gained a bunch
of weight for Fences,

469
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:02,828
and I told him, I don't care if he's
1,000 pounds, he can still get it.

470
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:05,789
Hey, Mama, don't talk…
Come on, don't be nasty.

471
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:08,500
It's time-out for all that nastiness.

472
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:10,752
You know what I mean? It's time to…

473
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:13,880
The shut down.

474
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:15,257
Hang the G-string up.

475
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,342
I told her, boy.

476
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:19,386
Oh, boy.

477
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:21,555
Anyway, strangest thing though,

478
00:24:21,638 --> 00:24:23,640
I just get off the phone
with the people at LA

479
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:26,184
and they tell me
they not gonna need me for a while.

480
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,437
What? Why?

481
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,148
You know, they need a little time
to get their restaurant together,

482
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:33,900
so I guess they gave me time to stay here,

483
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:35,736
- and help take care of Mama.
- You'll stay?

484
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,029
- Mmm!
- And help this nincompoop

485
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:39,364
with the Chicken Shack.

486
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:43,076
That's what I'm talking about.
Jones brothers, they're reunited, man.

487
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,537
It's for a little while.

488
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:49,416
I may have stretched
the truth a bit.

489
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,003
Chef Bentley wasn't thrilled
about me taking more time,

490
00:24:53,086 --> 00:24:55,130
but there was no way
I was gonna leave my mama

491
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:57,174
and this restaurant
in the condition they were in.

492
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,343
Especially not with my dumb head brother.

493
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:14,858
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up!

494
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:16,860
From this point forward,
shit's about to change.

495
00:25:16,943 --> 00:25:18,028
Shit's gonna change!

496
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:23,033
Now, Blazin' Jay's was once the most
respected chicken joint in this city!

497
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:24,826
In the whole goddamn city!

498
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,703
Okay, okay, thank you. Thank you, Gus.

499
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:29,998
But I don't need no…
No hype man for this one, okay?

500
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,209
Thank you, I appreciate your service.

501
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:33,627
At ease, soldier.

502
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:37,964
Now, the way we get back

503
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,926
to being the most respected
chicken joint in the city

504
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,303
is through respect in this kitchen!

505
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,472
- Excuse me, Sonny.
- Mmm.

506
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:47,808
And another thing.

507
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:53,980
None of you address me
as "Sonny" or "Mr. Sonny."

508
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:57,192
As a matter of fact, I tell you what,
you don't call me at all.

509
00:25:57,275 --> 00:26:01,404
You wait until I address you,
and when I do so,

510
00:26:01,488 --> 00:26:04,449
you respond with "Yes, Chef."
Is that understood?

511
00:26:08,036 --> 00:26:10,956
Obviously not. What do you want?

512
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:15,377
What's this?

513
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,838
Oh, see, I borrowed some money
from the cash register.

514
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,881
I can give you the rest back
next week, after we get paid.

515
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,845
You're fired.

516
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:27,347
Damn, you gonna fire her
just for that?

517
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,557
You think?

518
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,852
That's a pickle. Bye, bitch.

519
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:39,568
Yeah, this is so nice,
to have Sonny back

520
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,279
- to take over the restaurant.
- I know, yeah.

521
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:45,907
You know Dutch, he does the best he can,
but, well, Dutch is Dutch.

522
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:48,827
He done had ADHD since he was little.

523
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,496
Had him on that Ritalin,
but you know when they grow up,

524
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,999
they don't take their meds or nothing.

525
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:56,293
Oh, but with Sonny, I can finally rest,

526
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:59,421
'cause, you know,
he holds down everything.

527
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:02,340
- He does.
- I can hold it down.

528
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:05,260
I'm just glad he home.

529
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:08,847
So, did Jocelyn sing
that Eye on the Sparrow?

530
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,223
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

531
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:13,310
Oh, I love her high notes.

532
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:21,151
KP Z, yeah, nigga.

533
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,862
So you want me… You want me
to push the motherfucking weight?

534
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:26,239
I'm the motherfucking man, KP.

535
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:31,494
And even though you want me
to push the weight for you,

536
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:34,122
you really work for me, motherfucker.

537
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,042
Nah. That nigga kill me
if I say that shit.

538
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:40,128
My mother's sick right now, man.

539
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:43,548
KP, my mother's sick, man.
And I need a…

540
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:45,675
Nah, he ain't gonna
believe that shit either.

541
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:59,105
Yo, Alfred. What's up, my boy?

542
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:01,524
Most original. May I help you?

543
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:04,527
- Yeah, uh, where's KP?
- Who?

544
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:07,447
- KP.
- Oh, young master Phillips.

545
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,574
This way, please.

546
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:11,576
KP, kush pad.

547
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:18,083
Yeah, the party getting started, whoo!

548
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,085
Sexy ladies up in here.

549
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:24,255
I love a lot of mala-tala…

550
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,258
Honey Boo Boo ain't got shit on you.

551
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,426
This is serious, Kyle.

552
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:30,804
I'm running out of places
to hide your money.

553
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,723
Either find a business big enough
to funnel your money through,

554
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,017
or slow down.

555
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:38,937
"Slow down?"

556
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,564
You don't slow down in this business.

557
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:43,566
I said I'll handle it, right?

558
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:45,318
You just do your job.

559
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,364
- Hey, Mr. Mayor.
- Hey.

560
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:50,865
- Good to see you.
- You too, Kyle.

561
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,617
Man, this looks good.

562
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:55,954
Oh, my God. Mmm. What the fuck?

563
00:28:56,496 --> 00:29:00,500
Son, I was just telling the mayor that
we need to come down to the club soon.

564
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:04,087
Absolutely, I tell you what, I'll even
raise your handicap a couple strokes.

565
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,881
I got to make it fair, right?

566
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:08,425
Please do.

567
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:11,303
Oh, fondue!

568
00:29:13,054 --> 00:29:15,056
Oh, man, this that zesty shit right there.

569
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:16,766
What kinda cheese is this?

570
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,310
- Excuse me, guys.
- Is this real cheese?

571
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:19,978
That's the shit.
You know, when we was kids,

572
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:22,355
our mother get us that government cheese
that came in a big block,

573
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,691
and you had to take the knife
and come down on it.

574
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:26,318
You a white girl.
You don't know nothing about that shit.

575
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:28,069
Yo, let's do this.

576
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:31,489
Miss Johnson, what you doing
up in here, girl?

577
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,658
Shit. Hey, what's going on?

578
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:37,454
Man, what the fuck
are you doing here uninvited?

579
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:41,124
I took you up on an offer.
Remember the offer you had told me?

580
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:44,502
I'm ready to run with the big dogs.
I'm ready to come from up under the porch.

581
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,963
Man, you are not
the brightest bulb in the box.

582
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:49,674
You know, if I'd have known
this was a players' ball,

583
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:52,135
- I wouldn't even came.
- Either that or you're just fucking crazy.

584
00:29:52,218 --> 00:29:54,304
- You know my father is here?
- Your father?

585
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,514
The Mayor is here,
the goddamn Chief of Police…

586
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:58,725
- The Mayor?
- Plus, didn't I tell you I didn't wanna…

587
00:29:58,808 --> 00:30:00,518
Didn't I tell him
I didn't wanna see his face?

588
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:03,730
I am sure I told you
I didn't wanna see your face again.

589
00:30:03,813 --> 00:30:06,399
You know, I should fucking kill him.
I should kill you right now.

590
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:08,276
You gonna kill me? I thought we was cool.

591
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,570
- Don't kill me…
- Hey, man, shut up.

592
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:21,998
So you think you're ready
to come up to the Varsity.

593
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,793
Can I speak now?

594
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:28,046
Why the change of heart?

595
00:30:29,214 --> 00:30:30,924
Because I got sick.

596
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:33,968
And the doctor
have me on Mucinex.

597
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:35,553
There was green shit
coming out of my nose.

598
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:38,807
My mind was messed up.
They said the Mucinex did it.

599
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:40,975
Mixed with the Tums.

600
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:46,898
So you think you can move
a pound in a week?

601
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:49,692
A pound? Man, a pound a week?

602
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:52,654
A pound ain't nothing.
Look, the weed is already sold.

603
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:54,239
The weed is already gone.

604
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,157
All I gotta do is take it
and get the money.

605
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:59,369
Man, I got my aunties,
her friends be coming home from work.

606
00:30:59,452 --> 00:31:00,912
They want nickelbag.

607
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:03,289
The people… The people at the church.

608
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:05,667
I sell pastors, everybody weed.
Everybody…

609
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,628
So why not two? Shit, man,
matter of fact, why not three?

610
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,505
I can't do that much.

611
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:13,299
Three, um, no,
I'm just gonna be cool with the two.

612
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:15,760
Is that cool?
Let's just deal with the two.

613
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:19,472
Okay.

614
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:23,017
Okay, Teeny will hook you up.

615
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:24,352
Teeny?

616
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:26,396
Take him out the back,
make sure nobody sees him.

617
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:33,736
Hey, man. I won't fuck you.

618
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,239
- Fuck me?
- Yeah.

619
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:39,742
Do you honestly think
that I would let somebody like you

620
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:41,786
be in a position to fuck me?

621
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,496
No, no, no, no.

622
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,792
This is a very, very dangerous game
you're getting into, my friend.

623
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:49,878
Don't fuck yourself.

624
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,676
What'd I tell you about that phone?
You're fired.

625
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,428
What the fuck you mean I'm fired, nigga?

626
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:00,054
I'm gonna call Phaedra
and sue all your ass

627
00:32:00,138 --> 00:32:01,389
'cause I'm the best motherfuckin'
worker you got.

628
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:04,267
- You can't afford her.
- I can't afford what?

629
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,935
- Get outta here.
- Show me your hands.

630
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,022
- You don't even work here.
- So?

631
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:10,523
Spend some time in the street.

632
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,275
Outta my way!

633
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:14,402
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey, hey!

634
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:15,904
Hey, hey, hey.

635
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:22,202
Oh, shit, they fighting.
There's a fight. They're fighting.

636
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:24,621
- Oh, oh! Whoop her ass!
- They fighting, I'm getting that.

637
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,627
Watch out.

638
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:34,422
- Whoop her ass.
- Don't kill him.

639
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:37,175
Bringing down the damn property value.
I'm trying to run a business out here.

640
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:38,468
- Yeah?
- What business?

641
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:40,803
Fight or no fight, man,
you ain't making no money.

642
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,972
Here come the cops.

643
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:45,225
I've seen bigger fights
at family reunions,

644
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:47,894
so I was surprised
when the cops showed up.

645
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:49,646
- So was Dutch.
- Son of a bitch!

646
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:55,902
This is where
shit gets unbelievable.

647
00:32:55,985 --> 00:32:58,238
I wouldn't believe it
if I ain't seen it myself.

648
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,375
Oh, shit!

649
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:15,129
Put your hands behind your back.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

650
00:33:16,297 --> 00:33:18,091
KP gonna kill me.

651
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:21,427
This some bullshit.
I didn't do nothing.

652
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:22,971
Get your ass off of me!

653
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,597
Uh-uh. Oh, no, they got my baby.

654
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,933
Motherfucker! Who's gonna have
my fuckin' bail money?

655
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:29,644
It's a fucking chicken.
Fuck you, motherfucker!

656
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:31,312
I call you when you get out the pound.

657
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,273
- Off to jail!
- Sasha!

658
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:34,649
- Taking y'all bitch to jail.
- Sasha!

659
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:38,987
Good thing for them you got here.

660
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,614
Yeah, but thank you for helping me though.

661
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:43,783
Of course, no problem.

662
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,619
Yeah, look like I got my work
cut out for me.

663
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:48,580
Uh, yeah, you do.

664
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:51,583
Hey, on the bright side, it looks like
you're gonna be around a bit longer.

665
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,293
Yeah, look like it, don't it?

666
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:54,711
- Yeah.
- Looks like it.

667
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:57,255
Yeah, maybe we should catch up.

668
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:00,300
Yeah, we should. I'd like that.

669
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:02,927
Yeah, go get some Varsity hot dogs
and onion rings.

670
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:04,470
- Frosty.
- Hmm.

671
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:06,389
It's just like the old days.

672
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,891
- Hmm, like old times, huh?
- If I'm lucky.

673
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:11,311
Would you like that? Is that cool?

674
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:12,812
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- Love what?

675
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:14,063
Privacy?

676
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,649
Nothing, just having
a personal conversation over here.

677
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,527
Oh, well, don't mind me.
I'm just working over here.

678
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:21,321
Would you care to join me?

679
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:22,864
- Yeah, just…
- Thanks.

680
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:24,574
Give me one second. Hmm.

681
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:27,368
So he's a little protective of me.

682
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:28,911
Is that what you call that?

683
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:30,747
Just be nice.

684
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,957
- He big man.
- Hey, hey, B, it's okay.

685
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:34,959
Let me give you my number.

686
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,753
You had to let him smell you or something.

687
00:34:36,836 --> 00:34:39,088
Hey, Sonny, stop it.

688
00:34:39,172 --> 00:34:41,883
That is an incredible level to me.

689
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:45,011
- Here. Call me, okay?
- Okay.

690
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,971
- I'm damn sure gonna call you.
- Mmm-hmm.

691
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:50,475
- Yeah, ha!
- Shut up, you're so bad.

692
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,310
Hey, I shouldn't show it to him, should I?

693
00:34:52,393 --> 00:34:53,686
No, Sonny…

694
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,064
We got eyes on you, Sonny.

695
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:59,317
See you soon. Okay, go, go.

696
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:04,447
What is y'all doing? We still open.

697
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,741
This ain't no time
to congregate and socialize.

698
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:08,701
Y'all get to cleaning this shit up.

699
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:11,371
Everybody. Hey, man,
you just standing over there.

700
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:13,247
Your hair looking wise,
you're not a wise man.

701
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:14,999
Get… Get to picking something up.

702
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:17,418
This is a business.

703
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:20,755
Come on, man, we got to get
this stuff together. We still open…

704
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:22,715
Hey, drop some more chicken.

705
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,801
Get everything together.

706
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:27,428
Sheesh! I'm telling you.

707
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:30,348
Look, man.

708
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,100
I know you ain't caught
yourself no attitude

709
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:35,061
about this pterodactyl pit bull,
puppy-faced girl over here, man.

710
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:36,771
She was a bad apple. She had to go.

711
00:35:36,854 --> 00:35:38,648
I just don't wanna talk about it
right now, okay?

712
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:39,857
I can't do shit.

713
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,943
It's some bullshit right here.
I just can't, man.

714
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:43,695
We're in it bad because,
at the end of the day,

715
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:45,488
I'm in here doing all the work I can, man,

716
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:47,115
trying to get this restaurant
back together.

717
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:48,991
- Mmm-hmm.
- Supposed to be all the glory.

718
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:51,244
- And, I mean, every day…
- Hmm.

719
00:35:51,327 --> 00:35:53,371
Just follow my lead, man.
Stay outta my way.

720
00:35:53,454 --> 00:35:57,500
Just try not to be stumped
all the time, man.

721
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:00,461
Man, you do stuff right the first time,
you won't have to do it…

722
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:02,422
- Mmm.
- Over and over and over again.

723
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:06,259
Don't you remember? They tell you that
when you was a little boy.

724
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:08,469
Didn't nobody told you that
when you was a little boy, man?

725
00:36:08,553 --> 00:36:10,263
Listen, man. See, that's your problem…

726
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:13,266
I get all this shit, man.
It's good, you know.

727
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:15,268
You're damn, right, you know?

728
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:16,644
Hallelujah!

729
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:18,062
Yeah!

730
00:36:20,022 --> 00:36:21,357
Damn, we got this.

731
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:23,276
You liking that new recipe, huh?

732
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:27,989
Ooh. Boy, put that leg down.

733
00:36:28,072 --> 00:36:30,158
You thought you was gonna be back here
eating chicken all day?

734
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:31,617
Don't be looking at me like that.

735
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,995
- Why am I up here for?
- What do you mean?

736
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:36,289
You could have gotten one of these cooks
to fix this shit.

737
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:38,750
Do they own the establishment sign?

738
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,627
No, put it over…

739
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:44,297
No, tighten it up. See? Look at that.

740
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,965
See? Look at it.

741
00:36:46,048 --> 00:36:49,218
My nigga. I knew you could do it. Ooh.

742
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:52,764
Okay, I want everybody,
focus that attention.

743
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:55,308
I need perfection and professionalism
on this floor.

744
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:57,769
Now, these people come here
for one thing and one thing only.

745
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:59,353
And it is not your pretty smile.

746
00:36:59,437 --> 00:37:01,439
It is Blazin' Jay's Fried Chicken.

747
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:04,233
So I want these orders
turned around expeditiously.

748
00:37:04,317 --> 00:37:06,652
- Yes, Chef!
- I need fresh chicken,

749
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:10,531
fries and sides,
all in constant rotation.

750
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:14,660
Things were really
starting to look up.

751
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:16,496
Blazin' Jay's was on fire.

752
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:18,623
We could hardly keep up with the orders.

753
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:25,588
Mama was still in the hospital.
The doctor say she getting better.

754
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:27,423
And, with the restaurant doing so good,

755
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:29,675
it seemed like she back
to her feisty self again.

756
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:36,098
Even Sasha was taking notice.

757
00:37:36,182 --> 00:37:37,475
Wow.

758
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:43,356
I need all that chicken. I need that…
I need some more chicken fried.

759
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:45,316
We done fell off back here, man.

760
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,945
Stop bullshitting back there, man.
Get that chicken popping around here.

761
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:52,031
I can't believe it took all this time
for me to get back here to you.

762
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,117
I've missed you.

763
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:56,661
Not anymore.

764
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,205
- Yeah.
- Nom, nom, nom.

765
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,290
Don't eat me!

766
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:14,637
Oh, fuck!

767
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:20,476
God damn it! Shit!

768
00:38:31,696 --> 00:38:34,282
I'm thinking business is booming
because of my changes.

769
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:38,369
Meanwhile, Dutch taking our profits
to re-up on his little secret ingredient.

770
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:40,413
I don't know how I didn't see it.

771
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,794
- Hey, hey, Dutch.
- What?

772
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:49,046
Hey, you gonna need some more potatoes
over here.

773
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,590
Oh, let's get them some potatoes.

774
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:56,929
Pull up forward, pull up forward.

775
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:05,062
Get the cars rolling, man.
Let's keep them cars rolling!

776
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:06,480
Are you sending the ones
to the drive-thru?

777
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:09,358
Yeah, go through the drive-thru.
We got the wings over there!

778
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:10,985
- Okay.
- Hey, uh, what you trying to get?

779
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:12,236
We got free drinks.

780
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,625
Hey, man, goodnight.

781
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,001
Bye.

782
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:30,630
Music, rims, gold teeth.

783
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:33,716
Okay, that does not mean
they're drug dealers.

784
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:35,259
I had a grill in high-school.

785
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,553
Don't remind me.

786
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:40,097
You were always so square, man.

787
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,935
I'm just saying, why waste your money
on flashy cars and jewelry?

788
00:39:44,018 --> 00:39:46,228
Oh, so if it was Queen Elizabeth

789
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:49,190
driving by in her Rolls-Royce
and just dripping in rubies,

790
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:51,859
- you'd be saying the same thing?
- That's different.

791
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:55,279
My point is, when I make some money,

792
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:58,324
I'm gonna open a nice,
respectable business.

793
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,826
Oh, like Blazin' Jay's.

794
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,662
Yeah.

795
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:04,997
- Like your boys at Blazin' Jay's.
- Mmm.

796
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,791
The hate is strong with you, my friend.

797
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,293
Sasha…

798
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:14,215
I have some errands I have to run, but…

799
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:16,258
I was hoping, maybe later,
you and I could grab a drink.

800
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:19,804
Thanks for the invite
but I've got plans.

801
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,264
Laundry night again?

802
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:25,768
No, I've got a date,
thank you very much.

803
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:28,145
- So a date, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

804
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:29,355
Night, partner.

805
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,573
Okay, so you know

806
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:41,659
it's called paint and sip, right?

807
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:45,413
Yes, but you're trying
to get me drunk over here, so…

808
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:47,123
Like you could use
a little help over here.

809
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,166
Shut up, this looks good.

810
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,377
There's something to it.

811
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,463
- Mmm.
- See? She likes it.

812
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:57,091
- I bet she do like it.
- You're so bad.

813
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,051
Be the brush.

814
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:00,761
- Feel the stroke.
- Shh!

815
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:03,389
- What?
- She's gonna hear you.

816
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:05,766
She need to feel the stroke.

817
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,436
We gonna feel the stroke, shh.

818
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,939
It doesn't seem like she felt a stroke
in quite some time.

819
00:41:13,065 --> 00:41:15,985
Mmm, well, I feel her pain.

820
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:17,903
No.

821
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:21,449
- You serious?
- Yes.

822
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:24,160
- What?
- Being a cop doesn't really allow

823
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:27,204
- much of a love life, so…
- Why not?

824
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,167
I don't know. Partially, the hours.

825
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,337
And I think it's because men
are intimidated by my job.

826
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:37,506
Well, boys, maybe.

827
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:41,677
Plus, dating cops hasn't really
worked out too much for me either.

828
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:44,388
Must suck for your boy, Powers.

829
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:47,266
- Be nice.
- Why should I?

830
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:49,435
He's nice.

831
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:52,188
To who?

832
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:56,400
- Mmm.
- You know, I always wanted to know,

833
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:58,736
have you ever thought
about being anything else?

834
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,529
Mmm-mmm, no.

835
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:03,657
I love my job. Plus, you know my family.

836
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:06,368
We're all cops.
It's just… It's just what we do.

837
00:42:07,078 --> 00:42:08,204
Yeah.

838
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:13,125
I understand what you're saying,
and, while my work doesn't seem

839
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:17,213
nearly as important as yours,
I do understand the pressures

840
00:42:17,296 --> 00:42:19,715
- of following in your family's footsteps.
- Mmm-hmm.

841
00:42:20,758 --> 00:42:23,052
You know, my grandpa, Johnny,

842
00:42:23,135 --> 00:42:25,805
he was a traveling blues musician.

843
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:29,016
And legend has it
that he played the guitar

844
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,105
so good and so fast,
that they started calling him Blazin' Jay.

845
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:36,148
Wow.

846
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,109
Yeah, and…

847
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:40,736
And when he got tired of the road,
he settled here,

848
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,656
and that's how we ended up
with the Chicken Shack.

849
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:47,076
Wow, how come
you never told me this before?

850
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:49,829
Well, maybe because I was too busy
sneaking in and out of your house,

851
00:42:49,912 --> 00:42:53,332
trying to avoid your father.

852
00:42:53,415 --> 00:42:56,669
No, but I'm being serious though,
that is so cool.

853
00:42:56,752 --> 00:42:58,879
I'm not bullshitting,
I'm being serious, too.

854
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:00,339
He had a 12-gauge.

855
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,091
- Yeah, he did.
- I don't wanna get shot.

856
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:04,385
He still has it, yeah, he did.

857
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:07,012
- Hey, listen.
- Hmm.

858
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:09,473
How about a little less paint,

859
00:43:09,557 --> 00:43:12,518
- and a little more sip?
- Okay.

860
00:43:16,814 --> 00:43:18,149
Hi.

861
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:24,280
Anyway, so, Mom,
she grew up in that restaurant…

862
00:43:24,363 --> 00:43:25,489
Mmm.

863
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:27,825
- And when she got old enough…
- Thank you.

864
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:30,077
- She ended up running it.
- Mmm.

865
00:43:30,161 --> 00:43:32,371
Looks like that's what I'll be doing, too.

866
00:43:32,872 --> 00:43:35,916
Mmm, you don't seem too happy about that.

867
00:43:38,169 --> 00:43:39,920
Well, don't get me wrong.

868
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:41,422
I love to cook.

869
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,007
So what's the problem?

870
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:47,720
Well, I guess it's that…

871
00:43:47,803 --> 00:43:52,808
My aspirations have taken me
a lot farther than this place.

872
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:55,186
- Mmm.
- You know?

873
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:59,982
I think my dreams are bigger than just…
Just running the Chicken Shack.

874
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:04,737
Well, if it means anything,

875
00:44:06,197 --> 00:44:08,782
I'm glad you're back.

876
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:10,451
That actually means everything.

877
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,997
You know, I never said it,

878
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,251
but you are the only reason
I ever thought about staying.

879
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:24,757
That's funny, because with you being gone,

880
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,301
you're the only reason
I ever thought about leaving.

881
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:29,470
Mmm.

882
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:31,305
- Lucky guy.
- Mmm-hmm.

883
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:34,141
Mmm.

884
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,862
I got a double, whoo!

885
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:49,573
Don't be a poor loser, honey,
your mama's good.

886
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:51,533
- You taking his money, Mama?
- Yeah, baby.

887
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:53,577
- You taking his money?
- You got to face it,

888
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:55,120
your mama got skills.

889
00:44:55,204 --> 00:44:56,622
I think you're cheating.

890
00:44:56,705 --> 00:44:58,499
- Ain't nobody cheating.
- You are.

891
00:44:58,582 --> 00:44:59,485
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

892
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,211
Yeah, you know, I figured
you tired of that hospital food.

893
00:45:02,294 --> 00:45:03,671
Yes, I am.

894
00:45:03,754 --> 00:45:05,673
- Now I'll get you some of that yard bird.
- Yeah, you made this.

895
00:45:05,756 --> 00:45:07,383
- You made this.
- With the mashed potatoes,

896
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:10,344
- gravy. Enjoy yourself.
- Baby, that's so sweet of you.

897
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:12,346
- I had to do it. I had to do it.
- Mmm.

898
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,140
- Hoo-wee!
- This is good.

899
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:16,684
- I knew you'd like it.
- I knew you were gonna,

900
00:45:16,767 --> 00:45:17,977
I don't know why we're coming down here.
'Cause I knew you was gonna…

901
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,229
- Baby, baby, this is good.
- You were gonna love that.

902
00:45:20,312 --> 00:45:21,730
- You really like it?
- It's amazing.

903
00:45:21,814 --> 00:45:23,691
And I was concerned
that you would have a problem

904
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:25,693
with me kinda
playing with the recipe, so…

905
00:45:25,776 --> 00:45:28,362
You playing with the…
Mmm, God it's good, what you put in it?

906
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:31,281
Well, you know what I did,
was I took some, uh,

907
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:35,869
some mixes and blends of some herbs
and spices, and was playing with 'em,

908
00:45:35,953 --> 00:45:38,831
and that one, in particular,
is based in Himalayan garlic.

909
00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:40,833
- Oh, Himalayan?
- Yeah, Himalayan,

910
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:42,793
- I learned that up in the French Quarter.
- Ohhh!

911
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,921
Himalayan garlic,
it's the finest of all the garlics.

912
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:48,841
- Yeah. So glad you like it.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.

913
00:45:48,924 --> 00:45:51,427
Dutch, look at this.
Now, don't you be a hater.

914
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,595
- Mmm-mmm. How am I hating?
- You've got to give it to your brother,

915
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:54,680
- he did…
- I'm… I'm not doing…

916
00:45:54,763 --> 00:45:55,763
- He did this.
- I didn't even say anything…

917
00:45:55,806 --> 00:45:57,558
- This chicken is good.
- Yeah…

918
00:45:57,641 --> 00:46:00,060
- Always saying I'm hating.
- Don't worry about him, Mama.

919
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:01,687
So happy you like it.

920
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,647
And if you see our new
to-go box,

921
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:06,025
see, I did that, I ordered those,
I got our logo on there.

922
00:46:06,108 --> 00:46:07,443
I see that, baby,
move on outta the way now.

923
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:09,903
Well, you did put it in the to-go box,
and brought it over here,

924
00:46:09,987 --> 00:46:11,321
- so you can give him credit…
- You did, baby.

925
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:13,407
I guess, for that if you give 'em
for anything…

926
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,534
- I need to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

927
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:18,370
Yeah, you.

928
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:20,789
- Mama, I'll be right back.
- All right, baby.

929
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:22,541
- Oh, Lord, that is heavenly…
- What's up with you, man?

930
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:24,001
I got no napkin.

931
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,086
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

932
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:30,549
What's wrong?

933
00:46:31,717 --> 00:46:34,636
Say, man, why I don't never
get the credit for what I do?

934
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:37,848
What you want credit for?
What are you talking about?

935
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,767
Himalayan garlic, nigga?

936
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,770
- Please, really?
- What's wrong with Himalayan garlic?

937
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:44,897
You don't like my Himalayan garlic?

938
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:49,693
You know what?
There's one herb that you missing.

939
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:51,987
What are you…
What… You aight?

940
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:54,531
My kush.

941
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:56,867
Your kush?

942
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,369
That's my kush.

943
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:01,914
The oil that you're putting in
and making them wings?

944
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:06,043
It, it fell out of my hands, in there,
on accident and…

945
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:08,712
Chicken pot.

946
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:12,424
- I knew you was gonna like it.
- You bullshitting.

947
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:14,426
No, I'm not.
I mean, they loving it.

948
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,595
- They loving it.
- You bullshitting.

949
00:47:16,678 --> 00:47:18,347
Man, you playing.

950
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,099
- No, I'm not, I'm telling… Boy.
- No.

951
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:21,683
- I can tell when you're lying.
- No, I ain't lying.

952
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:23,018
- You serious?
- Yeah.

953
00:47:23,102 --> 00:47:24,812
Man, what the fuck is wrong with you, man?

954
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:27,439
Do you know how illegal this shit is?

955
00:47:27,523 --> 00:47:30,234
- Aw, man.
- And you gonna jeopardize my name,

956
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:33,195
you gonna jeopardize our family name,
our restaurant, nigga.

957
00:47:33,278 --> 00:47:35,030
Sasha's a cop.

958
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:36,740
And plus, kids eat that chicken.

959
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:37,991
I know, but…

960
00:47:38,075 --> 00:47:40,202
But kids smoke the devil lettuce, too.

961
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,287
They gonna get it from somewhere.

962
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:44,414
- They gonna do what they wanna do.
- I don't know what to say.

963
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:46,542
People from all over town,
buying all kinds of…

964
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,168
I'm talking about six pieces.

965
00:47:48,252 --> 00:47:51,672
Man, a dude came in here
the other day and bought a 24-piece.

966
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:53,257
Man…

967
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,134
He came back.

968
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:59,179
I don't know what the fuck
you got clinking together

969
00:47:59,263 --> 00:48:01,640
in your motherfucking head.

970
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:03,517
But I'm not
fucking with it, you understand?

971
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,519
This shit stops right here.

972
00:48:05,602 --> 00:48:07,187
This shit stops.

973
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,814
Man, this is the dumbest shit
you ever did.

974
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:11,275
I done
a whole lotta other dumb shit.

975
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:12,651
Fuck you, man.

976
00:48:12,734 --> 00:48:14,862
- Hey, nigga, I'mma kick your…
- Hey! Get off me.

977
00:48:14,945 --> 00:48:15,946
Get off me. Get off…

978
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,364
- What are you two doing?
- Nothing.

979
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,409
He grabbed me,
he was thinking about grabbing me.

980
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:22,202
I've known you this long
and I'm tired of your asses already.

981
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,788
Now, look, I'mma talk
some shit to you, some real shit,

982
00:48:24,872 --> 00:48:27,040
'cause apparently
that's how I got to speak to y'all.

983
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,418
If y'all can't pull your shit together,

984
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:31,587
I'm throwing both of y'all
the fuck up outta here.

985
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:34,715
- Man, I'm sorry, he started…
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

986
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:36,216
No, no, no, no.

987
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,262
See, when I put that original badge away,
that mean I don't give a fuck.

988
00:48:40,345 --> 00:48:42,264
Now, I need y'all to grab y'all nuts.

989
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:44,224
At least two of 'em.

990
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:45,642
A piece.

991
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:47,351
Eh…

992
00:48:47,978 --> 00:48:51,064
And act like men.
'Cause this is some real heavy shit.

993
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,359
We sorry.

994
00:48:54,443 --> 00:48:57,112
You should be sorry,
your mother needs you right now.

995
00:49:01,783 --> 00:49:03,410
Um…

996
00:49:03,493 --> 00:49:05,704
Her condition is actually
a little worse than we expected.

997
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:08,040
What you mean?

998
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:09,333
Eh…

999
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,376
I mean that, without surgery,

1000
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:14,838
best case scenario,
she has two months.

1001
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,592
Two months? Oh, man.

1002
00:49:19,468 --> 00:49:21,345
Shit. There ain't nothing to discuss,

1003
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:23,347
we got, we gotta have the surgery.

1004
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:26,391
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

1005
00:49:27,392 --> 00:49:30,103
The surgery costs $100,000.

1006
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:32,481
We can get the money, 100 grand, we can…

1007
00:49:33,398 --> 00:49:36,485
Mom got insurance.
She got head to toe, full insurance.

1008
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:40,489
Your mother's policy is not high enough
to cover the full costs of the surgery.

1009
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,283
So in order to save my mother's life,

1010
00:49:43,367 --> 00:49:45,327
we gotta be able to afford it?

1011
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:47,663
What's the insurance for?

1012
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,458
Insurance be some bullshit sometimes.
Real shit.

1013
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:56,046
- That's, that's crazy.
- Oh, man, so you saying

1014
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:57,965
- that we can't afford…
- In that case they can't…

1015
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,175
- …or my mother's dead?
- That's what they're trying to say.

1016
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:01,551
Dead like a motherfucker.

1017
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:05,138
I wish I had better news.

1018
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:06,222
Me too.

1019
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:07,724
- I'm sorry.
- Where's the head doctor at?

1020
00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:10,143
Ain't there nobody else
we can talk to other than you?

1021
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,231
- I'm as high as it goes with this.
- No.

1022
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,483
Crazy…

1023
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:18,402
Listen, just use
all that strength that y'all got

1024
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:20,112
that y'all be fighting with,

1025
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:23,073
and, you know, stop acting
like niggas around this motherfucker

1026
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:25,575
and just…
And get together and just be together,

1027
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,161
but don't hurt each other,
but pull together.

1028
00:50:28,245 --> 00:50:29,705
Strengthen yourselves.

1029
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:32,541
And your black manhood
and put your… I know you can do it.

1030
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:34,710
You, I can see it in your eyes,

1031
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:36,211
and you…

1032
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:38,422
I don't see it in his eyes,

1033
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:40,841
but I'm telling you,
if you work with him,

1034
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:42,676
- you're gonna find it.
- Man…

1035
00:50:42,759 --> 00:50:44,219
Trust me about that,
I'm as upset as you are,

1036
00:50:44,303 --> 00:50:46,513
but go ahead
and just keep working with each other,

1037
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:49,224
and, you know, listen,
as always,

1038
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:51,226
I'm always here for you.

1039
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,937
- Yeah…
- Like, if you need me, really call me.

1040
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,274
Uh, I get it, I'll call you
on this. He got the last one.

1041
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:59,276
'Cause he got the last time.

1042
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,862
Call me if you…

1043
00:51:04,114 --> 00:51:05,240
Thank you.

1044
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,871
Hey, man, you know what we got to do.

1045
00:51:11,913 --> 00:51:14,124
No. No, I don't know shit.

1046
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:17,085
What I do know, is I am not
feeling like getting mixed up

1047
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:19,880
in this damn
felony chicken you talking about.

1048
00:51:19,963 --> 00:51:22,716
Man. We better than that.

1049
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:24,134
I'm not.

1050
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:27,429
Now, we're already doing it.

1051
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:29,431
We've been trapping already.

1052
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:32,768
Shit. Let's go hard.

1053
00:51:32,851 --> 00:51:34,770
Let's get this money for Mama's surgery.

1054
00:51:35,812 --> 00:51:37,939
I can't even believe
I'm considering this shit.

1055
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:39,816
Oh, I'm considering it.
I ain't fooling with you.

1056
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,361
- Hold up, listen, listen, listen.
- What? What?

1057
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:45,197
If we do this, if we do this,

1058
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,575
we gonna do it for Mama.
We'll do it for Mama, the surgery money,

1059
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:50,369
and when we get it, we out.

1060
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:53,372
We quit. And we got to
change the name of the chicken

1061
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:54,998
so the kids can't buy it.

1062
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:57,876
Okay. The kids not buying
and stuff, I'm with that.

1063
00:51:57,959 --> 00:52:00,545
But the stopping and quitting?

1064
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:02,339
I'm going to the top.

1065
00:52:02,422 --> 00:52:04,091
You going to prison, nigga.

1066
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:06,385
- Do you know that?
- See, I can't do this with you.

1067
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:08,804
What the fuck are you saying?
Where you think you're going?

1068
00:52:14,851 --> 00:52:16,061
You is a trifling-ass man,

1069
00:52:16,144 --> 00:52:17,396
I hate you for this.

1070
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:20,357
That's the best rest she ever gonna get.

1071
00:52:21,191 --> 00:52:24,277
Look at her, man.
She high as… High as a mink coat, man.

1072
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:27,030
- That's how you wanna see your mama?
- That's what we're trying to do.

1073
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,036
I hated to admit it,
but Dutch was right.

1074
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,122
We were gonna
have enough for Mama's surgery.

1075
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:37,582
And it felt good to be on top again.

1076
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:41,086
I mean, we had
everybody coming out, man. Everybody.

1077
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:48,301
Eight hundred a week.

1078
00:52:48,427 --> 00:52:50,429
Everybody get money but, but you.

1079
00:53:01,106 --> 00:53:02,441
Get that temperature set correctly.

1080
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:03,817
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1081
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,444
Hairnet, check.

1082
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,739
Too many green beans in there.
Too many green beans in there.

1083
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:12,033
Like I said, you know,
things are getting…

1084
00:53:12,117 --> 00:53:14,035
- What are you doing?
- Man, I'm handling business.

1085
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:15,871
I've got some
important white folks on the line,

1086
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:17,205
- I can't play with you right now.
- Listen, man.

1087
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:19,374
What is this money doing
out here, man? You running a business.

1088
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,460
This doesn't go out here, okay?

1089
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:24,463
You're not in a Scarface movie, man.
This goes in the safe, Dutch.

1090
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:25,922
Hey, put it in the thing.

1091
00:53:26,423 --> 00:53:28,008
Like I said, I ain't playing.

1092
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:30,343
Cruise up in there,
you know what I'm saying?

1093
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:33,513
Yo, hey man!

1094
00:53:33,597 --> 00:53:35,474
Your chicken made me
wanna come get more chicken, man.

1095
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,976
Man, let me tell you something big, man.

1096
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:41,688
Come on, walk with me, man.
We doing bigger than anybody, man.

1097
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:44,858
I got that shit that killed John Wayne
in there, man. You know what I'm saying?

1098
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:46,943
And that's all the girl's been
talking about.

1099
00:53:47,027 --> 00:53:48,069
How they've been coming back through, man.

1100
00:53:53,992 --> 00:53:56,536
Mmm.

1101
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:59,289
So that's what all the fuss was about.

1102
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:03,710
What do you think? We could,

1103
00:54:03,793 --> 00:54:06,254
we could do this
the rest of our lives, huh?

1104
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:09,132
Mmm. If you're lucky.

1105
00:54:09,216 --> 00:54:11,134
Although I'd prefer

1106
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:13,053
not to do it in your childhood bedroom.

1107
00:54:13,136 --> 00:54:15,722
- Oh, you mean you don't like my twin bed?
- No.

1108
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:19,309
You hungry?

1109
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:22,020
What? You gonna cook for me?

1110
00:54:22,437 --> 00:54:25,273
Well, I think I could
do a little something for you.

1111
00:54:25,357 --> 00:54:27,859
- Okay.
- You did a whole lotta something for me.

1112
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:29,611
Shut up.

1113
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,780
Mmm. Let's see

1114
00:54:31,863 --> 00:54:34,282
- if we can get you to do it again.
- Okay.

1115
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:48,004
All right, beautiful.

1116
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:51,591
Mmm, this looks good.

1117
00:54:53,093 --> 00:54:54,678
Let's see what we got here.

1118
00:54:58,932 --> 00:55:00,392
So what's the verdict?

1119
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:03,853
Mmm?

1120
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:06,147
I'm about to come again.

1121
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:09,192
I'm serious. What did you put in this?

1122
00:55:09,276 --> 00:55:10,735
Just a little tender love and care.

1123
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:14,281
Mmm. That's some good tender love
and care.

1124
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:16,658
- Mmm-hmm.
- So maybe some seasoning salt

1125
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,993
and some truffles.

1126
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:20,287
Some of that special juice.

1127
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:23,290
Am I too motherfucking loud?

1128
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:24,457
- It's early.
- Huh?

1129
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:26,126
You early in the morning.

1130
00:55:26,209 --> 00:55:27,711
Hey, little bro, what's up?

1131
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:28,962
Sorry to disturb you, man,

1132
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:30,589
- we'll get outta your hair, you know?
- No, no, no.

1133
00:55:30,672 --> 00:55:32,549
Why don't you just join us,
we have plenty of food.

1134
00:55:32,632 --> 00:55:34,718
Oh. Yeah, please.

1135
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:37,012
Come on, girl.
Girl, sit your ass down.

1136
00:55:37,095 --> 00:55:38,722
You wanna open
this motherfucking chair for me?

1137
00:55:38,805 --> 00:55:39,791
Please stay.

1138
00:55:39,806 --> 00:55:41,266
See, I told you, I'm a motherfucking lady

1139
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:43,393
and I am to be fucking treated as such.

1140
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:45,186
You knew to open that chair, though.

1141
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,896
- This is what I got to deal with.
- Finally.

1142
00:55:48,106 --> 00:55:50,025
Somebody
with some motherfucking manners.

1143
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,319
I don't know you though.

1144
00:55:52,402 --> 00:55:55,488
Um, I might have been
inside of Blazin' Jay's a few times

1145
00:55:55,572 --> 00:55:57,657
to break up a few fights.

1146
00:55:57,741 --> 00:55:59,743
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yes, know that.

1147
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:02,329
That's that little lady cop.

1148
00:56:02,412 --> 00:56:04,706
Who arrested
my homegirl Rhonda the other day,

1149
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:05,874
- I don't like her.
- Come on, now,

1150
00:56:05,957 --> 00:56:07,042
don't start that shit in here,

1151
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:08,877
- now don't do that.
- Shut your ass up.

1152
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,045
Don't do that.

1153
00:56:10,128 --> 00:56:12,422
Anyways… Wow.

1154
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:15,383
So you dating Sonny, I see.

1155
00:56:16,384 --> 00:56:19,387
- Yes, little brother.
- That's crazy.

1156
00:56:21,681 --> 00:56:23,808
- Why is it crazy?
- Yeah, why?

1157
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:26,811
Don't even pay attention
to that, let her be. She ain't…

1158
00:56:28,188 --> 00:56:30,273
'Cause she been always saying that…

1159
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:32,942
He looks like Tevin Campbell,
that's what she saying.

1160
00:56:33,026 --> 00:56:34,861
She liked the first album.

1161
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:37,572
I'm Ready, the first single that he had.

1162
00:56:37,656 --> 00:56:39,407
You need to be ready to shut the fuck up.

1163
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:41,826
- Hey, will you calm down up in here.
- No, you calm the fuck down.

1164
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,662
- Anyways…
- …this motherfucker, man.

1165
00:56:45,914 --> 00:56:47,123
Yeah.

1166
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:52,337
But, I mean,
you know, it's whatever.

1167
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,756
I mean, I see it
though. He's a drug dealer.

1168
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,342
- Hey.
- You arrest drug dealers.

1169
00:56:57,425 --> 00:56:59,219
- Girl, would you stop?
- No, for real, baby…

1170
00:56:59,302 --> 00:57:00,804
- What's wrong with you?
- I mean, like,

1171
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:03,390
- this real Romeo and Juliet type shit.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1172
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:04,933
Like, I'm here for it.

1173
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:06,184
What the hell are you talking about?

1174
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:07,894
There ain't no shame and no game, bitch,

1175
00:57:07,978 --> 00:57:10,397
'cause ain't nothing
like a motherfucking drug dealer, bitch.

1176
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,899
They take care with the nails,
with the hair, motherfucker.

1177
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:14,150
- Hey, relax.
- Wait, is she serious?

1178
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:15,610
- Would you relax?
- Relax, what?

1179
00:57:15,694 --> 00:57:17,320
- She's obviously high.
- You tripping.

1180
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:19,572
Is she kidding?

1181
00:57:19,656 --> 00:57:21,825
- No, you need to stop…
- Relax, what?

1182
00:57:21,908 --> 00:57:23,243
What did I tell you about…

1183
00:57:23,326 --> 00:57:24,703
- I can explain. Listen.
- You know what?

1184
00:57:24,786 --> 00:57:26,454
I'm good. No. No.

1185
00:57:26,538 --> 00:57:27,440
- No.
- You think that's funny?

1186
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:30,000
Babe, babe.

1187
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,167
Man, what the fuck, man?

1188
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:32,502
- Get this bitch outta here.
- Bitch?

1189
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:34,295
- I'm sorry.
- You deserve each other.

1190
00:57:34,379 --> 00:57:37,048
You shut your ass up.
Who the fuck is you talking to?

1191
00:57:37,132 --> 00:57:38,883
- You tripping.
- That's the motherfucking problem.

1192
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:39,968
No, you motherfucking tripping.

1193
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:41,511
You walk around here,
looking like Lil Yachty.

1194
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:43,680
Oh, but you
fucking this Yachty body, huh?

1195
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:45,557
- No.
- You fucking the Yachty hottie, huh?

1196
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,851
I'll go ask Angela Bassett,
that's what I got.

1197
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:50,228
- Okay, I'm out. Fuck that shit.
- Oh yeah, you out? You out?

1198
00:57:50,311 --> 00:57:52,480
You out? You out?

1199
00:57:52,564 --> 00:57:55,358
Okay, listen. Sasha.
Wait a minute, listen.

1200
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,152
I know what you thinking,
but, but I can explain.

1201
00:57:57,235 --> 00:57:58,820
What else is there to explain?

1202
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:00,447
You're either a drug dealer or you're not.

1203
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,490
No, wait, I'm not a drug dealer per se.

1204
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:04,159
I don't sell drugs.

1205
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:07,162
There is about
this much weed in the chicken, though.

1206
00:58:07,245 --> 00:58:08,830
What?

1207
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:11,875
Okay, but it's not
like that, though. I didn't have a choice.

1208
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:15,295
Hey, listen. It's the only way
we can pay for Mom's surgery in time.

1209
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:17,422
She would die without it.

1210
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,716
- What was I supposed to do?
- Jesus, Sonny.

1211
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:22,635
- What?
- I mean, what do you expect me to say?

1212
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,012
I'm a cop.

1213
00:58:24,095 --> 00:58:25,346
Okay, I know. And you know

1214
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,182
I'd never put you
in any jeopardy if it wasn't for this.

1215
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:29,142
We almost got enough and I'm out. I swear.

1216
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:31,728
- I just need a little more time.
- I can't do that.

1217
00:58:32,437 --> 00:58:33,646
What you saying?

1218
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:36,316
I mean, I'm not gonna turn you in.

1219
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,818
But I can't be with you anymore.

1220
00:58:38,902 --> 00:58:40,653
Sasha, wait. Listen.

1221
00:58:40,737 --> 00:58:41,946
Goodbye, Sonny.

1222
00:58:42,906 --> 00:58:44,699
Sorry.

1223
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:46,326
Man, wait a minute.

1224
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:48,328
Sasha!

1225
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:55,919
Hey, I wanna try
that new firebird special.

1226
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:58,338
- Ten-piece coming up.
- A ten-piece?

1227
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:00,006
Who is that for? The baby?

1228
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:03,176
You better give me 15 and keep 'em cooking
unless they're turkey wings, all right?

1229
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:05,386
I can eat three pieces by myself.

1230
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,139
Bam! I'mma bad brotha on that chicken.

1231
00:59:18,775 --> 00:59:19,776
Here you go.

1232
00:59:21,444 --> 00:59:22,487
Okay, I got you.

1233
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:27,617
And here you go.

1234
00:59:31,287 --> 00:59:32,580
And here's your diet soda.

1235
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,501
Thank you, come again, now.

1236
00:59:36,584 --> 00:59:39,420
Aunt Carla's saying,
"Now, don't you go dyin' on me, bitch,

1237
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:41,339
you know you owe me $250."

1238
00:59:41,422 --> 00:59:42,841
- I love that shit.
- I don't owe her nothing.

1239
00:59:42,924 --> 00:59:43,925
Yeah, every penny's at…

1240
00:59:44,008 --> 00:59:46,219
She got so much
free chicken outta us, she owe us.

1241
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:07,157
What you doing?

1242
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,200
Let me get 21 wings,

1243
01:00:09,284 --> 01:00:10,285
- 21 drumsticks…
- Hmm.

1244
01:00:10,368 --> 01:00:12,412
- 21 biscuits,
- Twenty-one.

1245
01:00:12,495 --> 01:00:14,289
- and 21 sweet teas.
- Twenty-one.

1246
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:17,500
Thank you.

1247
01:00:21,045 --> 01:00:24,841
And to make it even worse,
I get a call from my boss later that day,

1248
01:00:24,924 --> 01:00:27,927
talking about he needs me
in LA and can't wait any longer.

1249
01:00:28,845 --> 01:00:30,972
So I was forced to make a decision.

1250
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:29,322
Man, what are we doing here?

1251
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:32,242
Man, you were
sitting around at home moping, man.

1252
01:01:32,325 --> 01:01:33,910
Shit, I said let's get a little turn up.

1253
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:36,246
What's great, P?

1254
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,539
Man, this is not my idea of a good time.

1255
01:01:38,623 --> 01:01:40,708
Shit, yeah.

1256
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:43,628
You'd rather be at home, boo'd up,

1257
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,546
eating some chickpeas or some shit.

1258
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,423
- Hey, hey, hey!
- If it weren't for your boo,

1259
01:01:47,507 --> 01:01:49,092
that's what I'd be doing right now.

1260
01:01:50,802 --> 01:01:52,553
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

1261
01:01:52,637 --> 01:01:55,723
- What y'all having tonight?
- Uh, we're gonna get that rose

1262
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:58,059
with two straws, you feel me?

1263
01:01:58,142 --> 01:01:59,644
Oh, no hell.

1264
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:01,104
- What?
- I'm not sipping on no goddamn straw

1265
01:02:01,187 --> 01:02:03,106
in no bottle with this nigga, man. No.

1266
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:05,400
The hell is wrong with you. No.

1267
01:02:05,483 --> 01:02:06,901
- Aw, man, that's crazy.
- No.

1268
01:02:06,985 --> 01:02:08,361
Man, you my little brother, man.

1269
01:02:08,444 --> 01:02:11,155
- Cut that shit out, man.
- No, thank you.

1270
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,240
Y'all having some food?

1271
01:02:12,323 --> 01:02:14,033
Uh, perch dinner.
Y'all got that perch dinner?

1272
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:16,744
Baby, we do not want no food,
why are you playing with people?

1273
01:02:16,828 --> 01:02:18,037
Man, I like perch.

1274
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:19,580
I like perch.

1275
01:02:19,664 --> 01:02:22,041
I don't even see how the hell
I let you drag me out here

1276
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,751
- on a Monday night of all nights.
- You know what, bro?

1277
01:02:23,835 --> 01:02:26,129
You're really, really
starting to scare me right now.

1278
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:27,922
- Oh, I'm scaring you?
- Yeah, you scaring me

1279
01:02:28,006 --> 01:02:29,882
- with how you acting.
- Oh. That's the scariest thing of all?

1280
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:33,469
We getting money

1281
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:36,264
Have a good time. Lay back, man.

1282
01:02:36,347 --> 01:02:38,683
Any man in here
should be smiling right now.

1283
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:41,394
All these bad bitches around here.

1284
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:44,772
Hey, yo, bitch, what's up?

1285
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:47,692
What the fuck is poppin'?
You tryin' to shake this vibe, what's up?

1286
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:49,861
Okay, what's up, bitch? I seen you.

1287
01:02:49,944 --> 01:02:52,155
- Hey, bae.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1288
01:02:52,238 --> 01:02:54,907
- Y'all know each other from somewhere?
- Since Rice Street.

1289
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,327
We was in motherfucking jail together,
that was my cell-mate.

1290
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,163
Oh, y'all was in county,
y'all weren't in there bumping pussies?

1291
01:03:00,246 --> 01:03:01,232
Shut your ass up.

1292
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:03,249
'Cause they…
That's what they do down in the county.

1293
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:04,709
- Undoubtedly.
- Yeah.

1294
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:06,627
You are… I don't even
like your little yellow ass.

1295
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:08,129
- You chokin'?
- Okay, okay.

1296
01:03:08,212 --> 01:03:10,923
- Unbutton that motherfucking top button.
- Okay, okay, relax.

1297
01:03:11,007 --> 01:03:12,383
Matter of fact,
what the fuck are we doing up here

1298
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:15,219
bullshitting with this motherfucker,
we need to be in the motherfucking back.

1299
01:03:15,303 --> 01:03:17,305
Getting these
motherfucking lap dances, nigga.

1300
01:03:17,388 --> 01:03:19,807
I got the motherfucking stash in the bag.

1301
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:21,601
Okay, for sure.

1302
01:03:21,684 --> 01:03:24,187
You ain't gotta say nothing,
you know I'm a veteran around here.

1303
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:28,399
I been coming to Magic City
before it was magic.

1304
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:29,692
Voila.

1305
01:03:29,776 --> 01:03:31,819
Oh, hey, let's go. Let's do this.

1306
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:34,155
Come on, man, let's get outta here.

1307
01:03:34,238 --> 01:03:35,907
I ain't going nowhere with y'all.

1308
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,825
You deserve each other.

1309
01:03:56,302 --> 01:03:57,303
Miss Johnson?

1310
01:04:05,144 --> 01:04:07,355
I wanna see your uterus
for my money.

1311
01:04:07,438 --> 01:04:10,024
Let me get a couple,
another bottle of that…

1312
01:04:10,108 --> 01:04:11,859
Uh, uh, of that rose.

1313
01:04:11,943 --> 01:04:13,486
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

1314
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:15,905
I ain't trying to get you fucked up
if you can't afford all this shit, Dutch.

1315
01:04:15,988 --> 01:04:18,658
Girl, shut the fuck up,
have you seen my restaurant?

1316
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:22,578
You bad 'cause you have
Chinese and Black, you Blackenese.

1317
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:26,165
I've got the new wings,

1318
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:28,042

1319
01:04:28,126 --> 01:04:30,461
Yeah. That's my shit.

1320
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:32,422
And it's guaranteed to get you fucked up,

1321
01:04:32,505 --> 01:04:34,924
while you're eating the wings
you're gonna want some more wings.

1322
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:37,301
Let's get that money,
I'm the new Real KP.

1323
01:04:37,385 --> 01:04:39,846
I'm the new KP,
I'm the new KP.

1324
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:42,390
Girl, watch that. Oh!

1325
01:04:42,473 --> 01:04:44,517
That ass is fatter
than a country boy's lunchbox.

1326
01:04:45,435 --> 01:04:47,979
I'm gonna cut your ass loose for this.

1327
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:49,564
Shut your ass up.

1328
01:04:50,064 --> 01:04:52,567
Oh! Oh! Girl, you know…

1329
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:54,569
Which hole did that air come out of?

1330
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:58,406
'Cause I smell
a lobster bisque now, all of a sudden.

1331
01:05:04,787 --> 01:05:05,787
KP!

1332
01:05:06,372 --> 01:05:07,957
Howdy, fellas.

1333
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,751
- How you doing?
- What's up, brother?

1334
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:13,880
So this is going to be
our last time, uh, re-up.

1335
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,133
This is going to be
our last re-up. After tonight, we're done.

1336
01:05:17,216 --> 01:05:20,094
Hold, hold up. I thought you said
you was going to let me do the talking.

1337
01:05:20,178 --> 01:05:21,262
Oh, damn, I did say that.

1338
01:05:21,345 --> 01:05:23,473
Okay. Well now,
you can say whatever you wanna say.

1339
01:05:23,556 --> 01:05:26,142
- I'm done talking.
- So you fittin' to fuck this up?

1340
01:05:26,225 --> 01:05:27,435
- No.
- That's what you gonna do…

1341
01:05:27,518 --> 01:05:28,561
- No.
- You gonna fuck this up.

1342
01:05:28,644 --> 01:05:31,898
No, you're gonna
fuck it up, just like you always do.

1343
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:33,691
You're lucky I'm here to help you.

1344
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:36,152
You're welcome.

1345
01:05:36,235 --> 01:05:39,238
See? There you go again,
trying to save the day.

1346
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:42,366
Hello? Excuse me.

1347
01:05:44,035 --> 01:05:45,161
This is you, dude,
you know. You do this.

1348
01:05:45,244 --> 01:05:46,996
- I ain't getting that…
- Okay, okay, okay, huh?

1349
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:50,082
Do you mind?

1350
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:53,628
Now look,

1351
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:55,630
I know about the secret ingredient.

1352
01:05:55,713 --> 01:05:58,049
- What's that…
- Man, ain't nobody… There you go, KP,

1353
01:05:58,132 --> 01:06:00,510
ain't nobody did no secret ingredient.

1354
01:06:00,593 --> 01:06:02,553
Don't bullshit me, man. Don't bullshit me.

1355
01:06:02,637 --> 01:06:04,222
Man, I don't know about you…

1356
01:06:04,305 --> 01:06:06,307
All right, I may not be
the sharpest tool in the shed,

1357
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:08,559
but I'd be willing to bet the farm

1358
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:10,811
that that secret ingredient
is why business is booming.

1359
01:06:10,895 --> 01:06:13,314
- Whose business is booming?
- Wait, come on, what?

1360
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:15,441
- Now you… Now you gonna tell me…
- Himalayan garlic.

1361
01:06:15,525 --> 01:06:16,984
- …that, yeah. We put…
- Okay, it's the Himalayan garlic.

1362
01:06:17,068 --> 01:06:18,945
…some weed into some sauce
and made it…

1363
01:06:19,028 --> 01:06:20,196
No. No, it's the Himalayan…

1364
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:22,448
Come check out
my new wings with that new kush in it.

1365
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:24,825
- I got the new wings with the kush in it

1366
01:06:24,909 --> 01:06:26,494
and it's guaranteed
to get you fucked up…

1367
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:28,412
- That ain't me.
- Let's get that money, I'm the new KP.

1368
01:06:28,496 --> 01:06:30,164
- That is not me.
- I'm the new KP.

1369
01:06:30,248 --> 01:06:31,290
- I'm the new…

1370
01:06:31,374 --> 01:06:32,416
So here's what's gonna happen.

1371
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,543
You're gonna keep

1372
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:35,461
putting my weed in the chicken,

1373
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,297
I'm gonna expand Blazin' Jay's,

1374
01:06:38,881 --> 01:06:41,509
and I'm gonna
rinse my money through the franchises.

1375
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:44,470
I… I think it's a good idea.

1376
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:45,680
No, no.

1377
01:06:45,763 --> 01:06:47,890
No, hell. Did you hear what I said?

1378
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:49,642
I said we done.

1379
01:06:50,268 --> 01:06:51,561
Man.

1380
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,938
That's what you…

1381
01:06:54,021 --> 01:06:55,731
You love your mother?

1382
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:58,484
Well, of course…
Why is you asking me about my mother?

1383
01:06:58,568 --> 01:07:00,736
- Yeah, what are you doing?
- How did she like the flowers?

1384
01:07:01,153 --> 01:07:02,572
What flowers?

1385
01:07:04,532 --> 01:07:05,533
KP.

1386
01:07:06,826 --> 01:07:08,786
You two are gonna do
what the fuck I tell you to do.

1387
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:10,913
- He just said something about Mama…
- Hey, man, come on.

1388
01:07:15,293 --> 01:07:17,086
Excuse me, sir? Sir?

1389
01:07:17,169 --> 01:07:18,588
Mama.

1390
01:07:18,671 --> 01:07:20,631
Mama. Mama.

1391
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:22,091
Hey, Mama. Mama.

1392
01:07:22,174 --> 01:07:23,884
- Mama!
- What? What?

1393
01:07:23,968 --> 01:07:25,136
Wake up.

1394
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:26,345
You okay?

1395
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:27,972
I'm wonderful.

1396
01:07:28,055 --> 01:07:29,765
What?

1397
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:31,183
Look, is somebody in here?

1398
01:07:31,267 --> 01:07:34,228
That man brought in some flowers.

1399
01:07:34,312 --> 01:07:36,397
- Huh?
- How it look?

1400
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,816
- Fucking KP.
- He was cute.

1401
01:07:38,899 --> 01:07:39,899
He was…

1402
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:42,445
What happening?

1403
01:07:42,528 --> 01:07:44,155
Nothing, Mama. Just rest.

1404
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:45,865
You gotta woke me up?

1405
01:07:45,948 --> 01:07:47,366
Y'all be careful out there.

1406
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,118
All right, Mama.

1407
01:07:49,201 --> 01:07:50,786
The fuck you done got us into, fool?

1408
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:51,772
What, man?

1409
01:07:51,787 --> 01:07:54,457
Look, I told you not to
talk to that man like that, okay?

1410
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,792
Will you grow up,
it don't matter how I talk to nobody.

1411
01:07:56,876 --> 01:07:58,836
You got us in bed with this maniac

1412
01:07:58,919 --> 01:08:00,921
and now he can get Mama killed.

1413
01:08:01,005 --> 01:08:02,006
Yeah, you right about that.

1414
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:04,300
Look, little bro,
I did get us in some shit,

1415
01:08:04,383 --> 01:08:05,885
but I can get us out.

1416
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:08,512
I can get us outta the trouble.

1417
01:08:08,596 --> 01:08:11,807
Man, you ain't never got outta trouble,
when you ever got outta trouble?

1418
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:13,768
Give me an opportunity, man.

1419
01:08:13,851 --> 01:08:15,978
I'mma give you a chance,
just 'cause I ain't got no choice.

1420
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:18,105
So I'mma just let you know
I have absolutely no confidence

1421
01:08:18,189 --> 01:08:20,191
in how you gonna handle this shit.

1422
01:08:23,235 --> 01:08:25,696
I wish I was the only kid.

1423
01:08:32,411 --> 01:08:33,412
Sasha?

1424
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,832
Mama Jay.

1425
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,500
How you doing?

1426
01:08:38,542 --> 01:08:41,504
Oh, Sasha, I haven't
seen you in a month of Sundays.

1427
01:08:41,587 --> 01:08:43,047
I know, it's been a minute. Here…

1428
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:44,840
I wanted to come and check on you.

1429
01:08:44,924 --> 01:08:47,218
- Oh. That's so nice.
- I got you a card.

1430
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:48,928
And petite.

1431
01:08:49,011 --> 01:08:50,763
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1432
01:08:50,846 --> 01:08:54,016
Oh, I have had just a lovely day.

1433
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,019
Some cutie came by,
brought me all those flowers.

1434
01:08:57,103 --> 01:08:59,355
And now you are here.

1435
01:08:59,438 --> 01:09:02,400
Wow, these are some gorgeous flowers.

1436
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:04,652
- Yes, yes, they are.
- Hmm.

1437
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:06,987
You know, I just saw
Sonny and Dutch in the hallway.

1438
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:08,948
- Is everything okay with them?
- Oh, who knows?

1439
01:09:09,031 --> 01:09:11,951
The two of them,
they're always fussing

1440
01:09:12,034 --> 01:09:14,537
- and playing and having fun.
- Hmm.

1441
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:17,498
- And stuff.
- Yeah. And that's always them, so…

1442
01:09:17,581 --> 01:09:19,125
Mmm-hmm.

1443
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,168
Uh-huh.

1444
01:09:21,252 --> 01:09:23,838
You ain't spying on my boys, are you?

1445
01:09:23,921 --> 01:09:25,297
Mama Jay, come on.

1446
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:27,133
- Ah.
- Of course not.

1447
01:09:27,216 --> 01:09:30,094
- How long you know me?
- Mmm-hmm.

1448
01:09:30,177 --> 01:09:31,637
You know how much Sonny means to me.

1449
01:09:32,388 --> 01:09:34,557
- Oh, does he?
- Mmm-hmm.

1450
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,934
Uh-huh? Okay.

1451
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,697
All we need is something to hold
over his head, then we can get rid of him.

1452
01:09:50,573 --> 01:09:53,492
Hey, man, I got a phone,
but I ain't trying to record

1453
01:09:53,576 --> 01:09:54,702
'cause I ain't no snitch.

1454
01:09:54,785 --> 01:09:56,620
Move your ass
right there under the cupboard.

1455
01:09:57,788 --> 01:10:00,207
You shittin' me?
That cabinet's too damn small.

1456
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,375
Why don't you get Darryl's tiny ass

1457
01:10:01,459 --> 01:10:02,501
to go in there?

1458
01:10:02,585 --> 01:10:04,336
Because I brought
this big-ass gun with me.

1459
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,630
Oh, no…

1460
01:10:06,714 --> 01:10:08,924
No, I can't.

1461
01:10:09,008 --> 01:10:10,885
Shut your ass up, nigga.

1462
01:10:10,968 --> 01:10:13,179
Stop trying to ditch
or I'll shoot myself.

1463
01:10:13,262 --> 01:10:14,555
All right, here.

1464
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:16,599
Thank you.

1465
01:10:16,682 --> 01:10:18,309
- We should've told him don't bring no gun.
- Damn.

1466
01:10:18,851 --> 01:10:20,895
I can't believe
I'm over here with y'all.

1467
01:10:20,978 --> 01:10:22,062
What the hell did I bring this for

1468
01:10:22,146 --> 01:10:23,981
- if I ain't gonna use it?
- My life…

1469
01:10:24,815 --> 01:10:27,568
I'll shoot his ass.
Boom! It's over.

1470
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:28,778
No more KP.

1471
01:10:41,248 --> 01:10:44,168
It's some bullshit.

1472
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:45,920
Now listen, you know the plan.

1473
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,632
Now, I'm gonna do all the talking.

1474
01:10:49,715 --> 01:10:52,468
And I ain't gonna get right into it.

1475
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:56,305
You know, I'mma ease into it
over time, so it ain't obvious.

1476
01:10:56,388 --> 01:11:00,601
Now you, what you got to do
is not try to help.

1477
01:11:00,684 --> 01:11:04,230
You just ask him stuff
from time to time, make it conversational.

1478
01:11:04,313 --> 01:11:06,941
- You good?
- Man, I know how to be professional.

1479
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:09,485
- Don't tell me how to be professional.
- Just act natural.

1480
01:11:09,568 --> 01:11:12,029
- I know how to be natural.
- Now, just act natural.

1481
01:11:12,696 --> 01:11:14,198
Hey, what's going on, guys?

1482
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:15,908
- Hey.
- How you gentlemen doing?

1483
01:11:16,784 --> 01:11:19,245
- How are you sir?
- So good of you to make it.

1484
01:11:19,328 --> 01:11:21,330
- This is the day the Lord is made.
- How are you guys?

1485
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:23,999
- Buenos dias.
- Wow.

1486
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,419
The weather is so nice today.

1487
01:11:27,503 --> 01:11:31,006
I mean, low participate…
Participation and, uh…

1488
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:34,635
- Precipitation.
- Precipertation coming from the south,

1489
01:11:34,718 --> 01:11:36,804
Doppler radar says something different.

1490
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:38,347
But have you guys seen that thing

1491
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:41,392
- with Donald Trump on the CNN…
- Hey, hey, hey, that's enough.

1492
01:11:41,475 --> 01:11:43,561
- Fuck is wrong with him, man?
- Nothing, nothing.

1493
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:45,896
Nothing. Nothing wrong with Dutch,
Dutch all right, man, Dutch cool,

1494
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:48,274
you know, he just probably
got in that chicken a little too much.

1495
01:11:48,357 --> 01:11:49,301
Speaking of which, hey look,

1496
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:51,277
why don't you go
drop a fresh batch for our guests?

1497
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,820
Man, I'm trying to be a professional.

1498
01:11:52,903 --> 01:11:54,780
- That's my professional thing.
- Man, you trying to fuck it up.

1499
01:11:54,864 --> 01:11:56,323
Get going.

1500
01:11:56,407 --> 01:11:58,284
- Wait, wait, hold up.
- Hey, hold up, homies.

1501
01:11:58,367 --> 01:11:59,827
Before you do that,
phones please, gentlemen.

1502
01:12:00,744 --> 01:12:02,121
Oh, man.

1503
01:12:02,204 --> 01:12:04,373
Here, man.

1504
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:11,714
- Trying to be professional.
- Man, get your ignorant ass back there.

1505
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:13,966
Juan, make a sweep,
make sure everything's secure.

1506
01:12:16,093 --> 01:12:17,553
Dutch. Dutch!

1507
01:12:17,636 --> 01:12:21,765
Now, I got to apologize
on behalf of my brother.

1508
01:12:22,474 --> 01:12:25,728
Went over there, had a little cocaine.
Can't help himself.

1509
01:12:26,395 --> 01:12:27,395
That what it is?

1510
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:30,524
I got your ass, motherfucker. Mmm-hmm.

1511
01:12:30,608 --> 01:12:32,276
It's a great day to do business.

1512
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:35,362
You called, said you wanted
to discuss business, here we is.

1513
01:12:36,947 --> 01:12:38,824
Let's sit down and get into it.

1514
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:40,451
Let's discuss business…
Where you going?

1515
01:12:40,826 --> 01:12:42,286
Let's talk business.

1516
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:46,624
Although I think you may have forgotten
a fundamental concept of our relationship.

1517
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:49,877
I'll be running the meetings.

1518
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:52,963
Have a seat.

1519
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,716
Okay, okay.

1520
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:01,430
All right, no problem, brother.
If that's how you want it.

1521
01:13:01,513 --> 01:13:03,057
However you want it, man.

1522
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:06,644
But you do know
that you have had your own relationship,

1523
01:13:06,727 --> 01:13:10,272
your own, you know,
your dealings with Dutch.

1524
01:13:10,356 --> 01:13:12,691
Not me. So now that I'm here,

1525
01:13:12,775 --> 01:13:14,318
it's time for us
to get to know each other.

1526
01:13:14,401 --> 01:13:16,153
- We should become acquainted.
- I agree.

1527
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:18,530
So now you can just
go ahead and fill me in,

1528
01:13:18,614 --> 01:13:21,951
along, you know,
how much weed to put in the chicken.

1529
01:13:22,034 --> 01:13:24,828
Okay, uh, what kind of weed
to put in the chicken,

1530
01:13:24,912 --> 01:13:27,081
how much the weed cost,
you know, we're putting in the chicken,

1531
01:13:27,164 --> 01:13:29,249
uh, where the weed comes from, you know,

1532
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:32,795
who grows the weed I put in the chicken
and what's the distribution process.

1533
01:13:32,878 --> 01:13:34,838
How do you get it here?
How do you get it here?

1534
01:13:34,922 --> 01:13:37,299
How do you get it here?
Now that's what we need to know.

1535
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:38,676
See, I need to know what you know.

1536
01:13:38,759 --> 01:13:41,971
So when you ain't around,
I can do things the way you want it done.

1537
01:13:42,054 --> 01:13:44,348
- Do you get what I'm saying?
- Let's start from the beginning.

1538
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:46,308
Yeah, that's how we…
That's how we gonna get there.

1539
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:48,185
- Sounds good, but here's the thing.
- What?

1540
01:13:48,936 --> 01:13:52,314
I would never
tell a chef what herb to use,

1541
01:13:52,398 --> 01:13:54,358
or not use, for that matter.

1542
01:13:54,441 --> 01:13:57,319
That's not my job. That's…
I stay away from that kind of thing.

1543
01:13:57,403 --> 01:13:59,488
Oh, no, don't stay away
from it, you should get right into it.

1544
01:13:59,571 --> 01:14:02,241
I think the success of our relationship
kind of depends on that.

1545
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:05,995
Yeah, you know I don't know
much about cooking, man, I just…

1546
01:14:06,078 --> 01:14:07,078
I like to stick

1547
01:14:07,121 --> 01:14:08,998
- with what my expertise is.
- Give me some chicken.

1548
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,916
I just pay the bills.

1549
01:14:12,418 --> 01:14:14,294
I'm just asking
because the chicken

1550
01:14:14,378 --> 01:14:16,422
really helping Mama's pain, you know?

1551
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:20,050
And, and I'm just wondering
how do you have such potent weed

1552
01:14:20,134 --> 01:14:21,885
with such a smooth high?

1553
01:14:21,969 --> 01:14:24,263
Okay, 'cause this
is helping your mama, I'll tell you this.

1554
01:14:24,346 --> 01:14:25,764
- Ah!
- Now listen…

1555
01:14:25,848 --> 01:14:28,726
Fresh batch of chicken
for you here there, boss.

1556
01:14:29,935 --> 01:14:32,062
- Yeah, great.
- Thank you so much.

1557
01:14:32,146 --> 01:14:35,024
No problem.
So now that we're partners, okay,

1558
01:14:35,107 --> 01:14:37,526
we need to get all the details laid out.

1559
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:39,153
We was just saying that.

1560
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:41,113
- Look, all you need to know…
- Mmm-hmm.

1561
01:14:41,196 --> 01:14:43,365
…is I'm about to
make you both very rich men.

1562
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:44,908
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- All right?

1563
01:14:44,992 --> 01:14:46,827
My weed, your chicken,

1564
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:51,623
and a bunch of franchises
means millions of dollars for all of us.

1565
01:14:51,707 --> 01:14:54,752
Well, say it then, brother.
Say it again, will you?

1566
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:56,170
What was that?

1567
01:14:56,253 --> 01:14:57,296
- What?
- What?

1568
01:14:57,379 --> 01:14:58,589
- What was what?
- I don't hear nothing.

1569
01:14:58,672 --> 01:14:59,715
Somebody sneezed.

1570
01:14:59,798 --> 01:15:02,843
- Don't start that.
- I just got gas is all.

1571
01:15:02,926 --> 01:15:04,303
Go see who's hiding over there.

1572
01:15:04,386 --> 01:15:05,804
No, no, no, no.
Ain't nobody hiding over there.

1573
01:15:07,806 --> 01:15:09,516
Oh, Lord.

1574
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:12,102
What the hell is that?

1575
01:15:12,186 --> 01:15:13,437
It's going live. It's going live.

1576
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,147
What's he doing in here?

1577
01:15:16,398 --> 01:15:18,942
Facebook live, I think I'm gonna die, man.

1578
01:15:19,526 --> 01:15:21,653
I'm caught up in this damn bathroom.

1579
01:15:21,737 --> 01:15:23,280
They already got Goo, Ma…

1580
01:15:23,655 --> 01:15:25,741
I love you.
Don't give anybody none of my shit.

1581
01:15:25,824 --> 01:15:27,701
Leave my cutlets right where it's at.

1582
01:15:27,785 --> 01:15:29,995
If Keisha come over there looking for it,
don't give her shit.

1583
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:31,955
Don't give my baby mama shit.
Neither one of them.

1584
01:15:33,457 --> 01:15:34,792
I think I hear something.

1585
01:15:56,271 --> 01:15:58,941
I'm going to pop
into Blazin' Jay's really quick.

1586
01:15:59,483 --> 01:16:01,735
Come on, Sash.
I'm just gonna stay in the car.

1587
01:16:02,694 --> 01:16:04,947
- I'm gonna whip you two up in here.
- Mmm-mmm.

1588
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,949
Give me the fucking gun.

1589
01:16:07,032 --> 01:16:08,951
- Give me the fucking gun.
- Oh, fuck. You gonna have to think of it.

1590
01:16:09,034 --> 01:16:10,202
Cool. Cool. You all right?

1591
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:11,620
- Go, go.
- Okay.

1592
01:16:11,703 --> 01:16:14,540
- Wait, wait.
- Get your fucking ass over there.

1593
01:16:14,623 --> 01:16:16,333
Now what the fuck did you think
you were gonna do with this?

1594
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:17,960
You're gonna blackmail me?

1595
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:20,212
- It ain't even like that, man.
- No.

1596
01:16:20,504 --> 01:16:21,797
You gonna show this to the police?

1597
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,633
The police are on my fucking payroll.
I own the police.

1598
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:26,927
- I don't know why you tripping, man.
- Chill out, man.

1599
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,762
- Don't move.
- Hey, get down.

1600
01:16:28,846 --> 01:16:30,764
Sasha. Damn, girl, you cold.

1601
01:16:30,848 --> 01:16:32,224
- Oh, shit.
- Thank you.

1602
01:16:32,307 --> 01:16:33,684
- Thank you.
- Nigga, shit.

1603
01:16:35,936 --> 01:16:37,521
Powers, what are you doing?

1604
01:16:37,604 --> 01:16:39,857
I got way too good of a thing
going on here, Sasha.

1605
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:41,942
You sure as hell
ain't gonna get in the way of it.

1606
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:51,702
Get off me.

1607
01:16:55,998 --> 01:16:57,541
Get your fucking nuts off me.

1608
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:04,756
You need to pay me, then like,
treat yourself like lottery.

1609
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,301
I mean, 40 scrape marks on that…

1610
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:09,219
You gonna hit the J
or you gonna hold it there?

1611
01:17:12,306 --> 01:17:13,599
Oh, shit.

1612
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:20,063
He knows I smoke, but there's an issue.

1613
01:17:20,147 --> 01:17:22,399
This shit wild.

1614
01:17:23,817 --> 01:17:26,278
Violence is not the answer.

1615
01:17:30,991 --> 01:17:32,618
Ain't nothing in this thing.

1616
01:17:34,077 --> 01:17:35,120
Sasha!

1617
01:17:35,829 --> 01:17:37,748
I got her.

1618
01:17:38,665 --> 01:17:40,876
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1619
01:17:47,883 --> 01:17:50,219
You got another clip?
I need another clip for this.

1620
01:17:50,928 --> 01:17:54,139
That gun don't take no fucking clips.
That's a revolver.

1621
01:17:54,223 --> 01:17:56,850
How am I supposed to know that shit?

1622
01:17:56,934 --> 01:17:59,436
They gotta be outta ammo, KP.

1623
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:02,314
I guess this is it, man. I love you.

1624
01:18:02,397 --> 01:18:03,523
I love you too, bro.

1625
01:18:03,607 --> 01:18:06,318
I'm gonna tell them to shoot me first
so I don't have to see yours.

1626
01:18:06,401 --> 01:18:07,569
Selfish motherfucker.

1627
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:09,613
Isn't this sweet?

1628
01:18:10,447 --> 01:18:12,574
One last family reunion for you boys, huh?

1629
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,451
Wish Mama Jay herself was here.

1630
01:18:14,534 --> 01:18:15,869
- Come on, man.
- What the fuck you mean?

1631
01:18:15,953 --> 01:18:17,496
Speaking of your mama, what do you think
is gonna hurt her the most?

1632
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:18,872
Both of you dead at the same time?

1633
01:18:19,414 --> 01:18:21,333
Or the fact they were killed
by a brave officer

1634
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,834
who was avenging
the murder of his partner?

1635
01:18:22,918 --> 01:18:23,820
Come on, man.

1636
01:18:23,835 --> 01:18:25,337
- He's a hateful motherfucker.
- It ain't like that.

1637
01:18:28,173 --> 01:18:30,217
- What the fuck?
- Jesus.

1638
01:18:30,926 --> 01:18:33,178
He would just not shut the fuck up.

1639
01:18:34,304 --> 01:18:37,057
Oh, well, plenty of cops
in the sea, right?

1640
01:18:38,475 --> 01:18:41,103
It's a damn shame
these brave officers busted you

1641
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:44,022
and you all went down in a blaze of glory.

1642
01:18:45,357 --> 01:18:47,526
- Tragic.
- No!

1643
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:51,321
That's your ass now, motherfucker.

1644
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:52,531
Drop the weapon.

1645
01:18:54,366 --> 01:18:56,285
Get your hands behind your head.

1646
01:18:56,368 --> 01:18:59,246
- Do it.
- Travis, what the fuck, man.

1647
01:18:59,788 --> 01:19:00,998
This is the fuck.

1648
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,458
- All right.
- This is the whole motherfucking pickle.

1649
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:06,086
We got caught, motherfucker,
putting the weed in the chicken,

1650
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:07,921
serving it to the damn customers, bitch.

1651
01:19:08,005 --> 01:19:10,549
My baby's hot business about to go
in the hot flames, bitch.

1652
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:12,384
Bitch, I heard they had a full shootout.

1653
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:13,844
Like a cop-got-killed
type shootout. Okay?

1654
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:15,846
- Damn.
- And they arrested them.

1655
01:19:15,929 --> 01:19:18,807
- Motherfucking good. 'Cause bitch… Hold.
- Hey.

1656
01:19:19,683 --> 01:19:20,683
Cut through it.

1657
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,228
Come here. Who the motherfucking…

1658
01:19:23,312 --> 01:19:24,688
Man, will you get this lady off of me?

1659
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:26,898
Can't believe bailed on me like that, bro.

1660
01:19:26,982 --> 01:19:29,985
If it wasn't for me, your mongoose-looking
ass be floating up in the Chattahoochee.

1661
01:19:30,068 --> 01:19:31,278
I'll be the one calling the police.

1662
01:19:33,113 --> 01:19:34,113
Goodness.

1663
01:19:35,324 --> 01:19:36,867
Hey, so Sonny,

1664
01:19:37,117 --> 01:19:38,535
sorry about your restaurant.

1665
01:19:38,618 --> 01:19:40,120
Ah, it's all right, babe.

1666
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:42,622
Sometimes, we all need a fresh start.

1667
01:19:42,706 --> 01:19:44,499
- Mmm-hmm.
- At least I got you.

1668
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:47,711
Hey, man, when you get done with her,

1669
01:19:48,253 --> 01:19:49,838
I gotta ruiner injury.

1670
01:19:49,921 --> 01:19:52,466
Whatever you making
on this thing right here,

1671
01:19:52,549 --> 01:19:53,675
you can make it in the night.

1672
01:19:54,009 --> 01:19:56,720
I'm about to make your motherfucking teeth
in the night, my nigga.

1673
01:19:56,928 --> 01:19:58,055
What the fuck is you doing?

1674
01:19:58,138 --> 01:20:01,183
I was just trying to get them
antibiotics that you had asked me for.

1675
01:20:01,266 --> 01:20:04,061
- Girl, you actin' a fool around here.
- Get your motherfuckin' ass out the…

1676
01:20:04,144 --> 01:20:05,812
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let go of me.

1677
01:20:06,438 --> 01:20:08,065
Hey, don't get too happy.

1678
01:20:08,148 --> 01:20:11,777
I got the Mayor on speed dial.
I'll be out by this afternoon!

1679
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:13,570
I'll be out this afternoon.

1680
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,073
You probably will be.

1681
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:18,992
No, we didn't get no evidence on him
after all that.

1682
01:20:20,118 --> 01:20:22,162
Hey, I didn't show you
the recording.

1683
01:20:22,412 --> 01:20:24,039
- That's my dick. All right. There you go.
- Oh, my God.

1684
01:20:24,164 --> 01:20:26,166
I'm about to
make you both very rich men.

1685
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:29,378
How long was he recording?

1686
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:31,129
Put this down. Put it down, man.

1687
01:20:31,213 --> 01:20:32,839
- You always showing people shit.
- What do you want?

1688
01:20:32,923 --> 01:20:34,591
- Get that video?
- You need the video?

1689
01:20:34,674 --> 01:20:37,010
Give him the video.
Give him that shit, bro.

1690
01:20:37,094 --> 01:20:39,262
My weed,
your chicken, and a bunch of franchises…

1691
01:20:39,346 --> 01:20:41,181
- How do you feel like?
- Good angle.

1692
01:20:41,264 --> 01:20:42,808
- Yeah, it's great angles.
- Millions of dollars…

1693
01:20:42,891 --> 01:20:44,559
- Well, you have a future in filmmaking.
- For all of us.

1694
01:20:45,894 --> 01:20:48,355
Yeah, we've been investigating
Mr. Philips for a long time

1695
01:20:48,438 --> 01:20:51,400
and this video is just what we needed
to bring him down.

1696
01:20:53,777 --> 01:20:55,570
There's one issue though, fellas.

1697
01:20:55,654 --> 01:20:57,781
- What's that?
- The video also…

1698
01:20:58,156 --> 01:21:00,200
It suggests that, uh,

1699
01:21:01,034 --> 01:21:03,370
both of you were selling weed
in your chicken.

1700
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:04,996
Oh, no, no.

1701
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:07,791
- Look, look.
- Nah.

1702
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:10,127
You're not who we're after.

1703
01:21:10,627 --> 01:21:11,837
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1704
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,630
This is all over the news right now.

1705
01:21:13,713 --> 01:21:15,465
And I can't make that just go away.

1706
01:21:16,091 --> 01:21:17,801
Somebody's gotta be held accountable.

1707
01:21:17,884 --> 01:21:19,761
Hold me accountable. Okay?

1708
01:21:19,845 --> 01:21:23,265
Tell the DA that Sonny ain't had
nothin' to do with it,

1709
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:26,226
that it was all me. You know what I mean?

1710
01:21:26,309 --> 01:21:27,853
- No, man.
- No, big bro.

1711
01:21:27,936 --> 01:21:29,354
I'm gonna take the fall for you, man.

1712
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:31,690
'Cause I've been around here
fucking up, man, you know.

1713
01:21:31,773 --> 01:21:34,443
You ain't have to fall for me 'cause…

1714
01:21:34,734 --> 01:21:38,280
- Anyway. But no. No. You can't do that.
- You know what I mean.

1715
01:21:38,363 --> 01:21:39,363
All right, look.

1716
01:21:40,157 --> 01:21:41,491
Given the circumstances,

1717
01:21:42,367 --> 01:21:44,202
you're gonna have to do some time but…

1718
01:21:47,622 --> 01:21:48,622
I'll see what I can do.

1719
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:50,542
- That's what I'm talking about, man.
- All right?

1720
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:51,625
Thank you.

1721
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:54,754
- You a real nigga, man.
- Nothing gonna happen with my shop, right?

1722
01:21:55,172 --> 01:21:57,257
- You know this.
- The shop, man.

1723
01:22:06,099 --> 01:22:07,099
Man.

1724
01:22:08,143 --> 01:22:09,978
Finally in this bitch.

1725
01:22:10,562 --> 01:22:13,273
Man, don't let nothing happen
to this car, man. Please.

1726
01:22:13,356 --> 01:22:16,067
Man, ain't nobody gonna let nothing happen
to this raggedy motherfucker.

1727
01:22:16,693 --> 01:22:19,029
And don't let nobody steal my CDs.

1728
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:22,991
Ain't nobody listening
to no CDs no more, man.

1729
01:22:23,575 --> 01:22:26,995
One last one.

1730
01:22:27,078 --> 01:22:30,207
And if something happen to me in there,
tell my girl I love her.

1731
01:22:33,543 --> 01:22:35,545
Man, you got 90 days of rehab.

1732
01:22:36,796 --> 01:22:39,090
What the hell you think
gonna happen to you in here?

1733
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:42,761
All right, man.
Somebody's sounding a little ungrateful.

1734
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:46,556
I'm gonna do this just this one time.

1735
01:22:49,309 --> 01:22:50,936
Vanna White!

1736
01:22:54,231 --> 01:22:56,399
Hey, man. I really do appreciate
you doing this, bro.

1737
01:22:56,483 --> 01:22:57,817
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1738
01:22:58,235 --> 01:23:00,654
- Appreciate it.
- This is for you.

1739
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:02,571
Yeah, you need it.

1740
01:23:03,532 --> 01:23:05,825
- I'm gonna be strong up in there.
- Go and get yourself together, man.

1741
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:08,453
- I'm gonna come out of here like this.
- Yeah, man!

1742
01:23:08,745 --> 01:23:11,456
- See ya 89 days, bro.
- Aye!

1743
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,707
I love you.

1744
01:23:33,061 --> 01:23:35,522
In the end, everything turned out okay.

1745
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:39,317
Mama got her surgery, and I did
end up running a restaurant in LA.

1746
01:23:40,068 --> 01:23:43,822
Uh, it may not be Michelin-rated,
but it's ours.

1747
01:23:44,281 --> 01:23:47,534
And I can't say enough about
their recreation out here in California.

1748
01:23:49,494 --> 01:23:51,830
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1749
01:23:51,955 --> 01:23:55,000
- I'm home, bitches.
- Yeah, man, how you feel?

1750
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:58,295
- Man, this is dope.
- Yeah.

1751
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:01,756
- Hey, man…
- Dutch! My other favorite son!

1752
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,508
- Mama Jay!
- Look at you!

1753
01:24:04,175 --> 01:24:06,428
Woo!

1754
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:08,305
My boys.

1755
01:24:08,388 --> 01:24:12,142
- Business is booming again.
- Man, it is. It's going down. I like this.

1756
01:24:12,267 --> 01:24:14,894
California's the place
for Blazin' Jays, baby.

1757
01:24:14,978 --> 01:24:16,438
- And I got a surprise for you.
- Oh!

1758
01:24:16,521 --> 01:24:18,356
Oh, my goodness.

1759
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,191
- They love this chicken.
- And guess what?

1760
01:24:20,275 --> 01:24:21,776
- That ain't it.
- Watch out now. Watch out now.

1761
01:24:22,736 --> 01:24:25,113
- Who is this?
- This you, baby.

1762
01:24:25,196 --> 01:24:27,073
- Beautiful, man.
- This is you, man.

1763
01:24:27,157 --> 01:24:29,034
- This is mine?
- Yes, sir.

1764
01:24:29,117 --> 01:24:31,953
Boom!

1765
01:24:34,456 --> 01:24:37,667
- It's you, man. Welcome to LA, bro.
- Oh, my God.

1766
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,587
Oh! Look who it is.

1767
01:24:41,212 --> 01:24:42,756
- All right.
- How you doin'?

1768
01:24:45,091 --> 01:24:46,593
- Hey, babe. What's up?
- Good to see you.

1769
01:24:46,676 --> 01:24:49,554
Man, this is good to see you.

1770
01:24:50,722 --> 01:24:53,600
You gonna have to get
your own police lady.

1771
01:24:54,893 --> 01:24:56,811
Come on, you all, let's go
eat some more chicken.

1772
01:24:56,895 --> 01:24:58,438
Mama need her medicine.

1773
01:24:58,521 --> 01:25:01,107
Hey, listen, Mama, you know
how you get when you eat too much chicken?

1774
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:03,610
You don't tell me what to do.
I take my belt off.

1775
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,153
I'll get you all.

1776
01:25:08,406 --> 01:25:09,574
Hello.

1777
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:11,618
Sherri, girl. What's happening?

1778
01:25:12,661 --> 01:25:14,204
Have you ever been on a plane?

1779
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:18,083
Well, I got tickets.
I got buddy fares, all kinds of shit.
