00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,940
I, Lemuel Gulliver

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,450
give thee a faithful history

7
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,110
of my most interesting adventure

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,530
in the South Sea.

9
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,410
On the 5th day of November, 1699,

10
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,160
having reached latitude 30 degrees,

11
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,210
two minutes south,

12
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,290
a storm of great fury suddenly...

13
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,940
All's well!

14
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,780
All's well!

15
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,640
Why do they make me sing that song?

16
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,190
The poet who wrote it was certainly wrong.

17
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,900
It's bright ahead. The light's ahead.

18
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,320
I'd rather go home and go right to bed.

19
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,410
All's well!

20
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,750
My feet are wet and my bunions ache,

21
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,460
and yet I've to keep wide awake,

22
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,960
all night!

23
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,720
I wake folks up to tell them
things are all right!

24
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:53,230
A, A, All's well! Wha, wha, what's a rainy day?

25
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,680
The king has visitors.

26
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,180
Do you know they're signing a wedding contract?

27
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,400
There's a giant on the beach!

28
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,060
There, there's a giant out there!

29
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,540
Your majesty.

30
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,830
Thank you, your majesty.

31
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,210
Marriage Contract

32
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,800
King Little of Lilliput

33
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,430
Does this 5th day of November 1699
give the hand of his daughter

34
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,930
Princess Glory

35
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,600
to Prince David

36
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,390
son of Bombo

37
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,150
King of Blefuscu!

38
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,610
Quite in order, fine.

39
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,780
King Bombo!

40
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,980
Well we did it, you little rascal, you.
We did it.

41
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,310
Yes we, we certainly did, didn't we?

42
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:41,280
Just a couple of old dag cupids, I think! [laughs}

43
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,160
Your majesty, the wedding things are here.

44
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,580
There's a giant on the beach!
Let me go!

45
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,600
Let me go! Let me go!
There's a giant on the beach! Let me go!

46
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,190
Exquisite taste, exquisite!

47
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:35,790
Roses, Freesia, Rhododendrons,
Ranunculus, Snap Dragons, and Daisies.

48
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,710
Ahh!

49
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,340
They're pretty Posies, aren't they?

50
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,470
Beautiful blooms, beautiful!

51
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,860
Oh!

52
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,940
May I?

53
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,200
Oh, please do!

54
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,920
Magnificent!

55
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,350
Oh! A masterpiece!

56
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,490
Vanilla. Wow!

57
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,380
My only little daughter. I dread losing her.

58
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,300
Huh, Buck up there old boy, you're not
losing a daughter. You're gaining a son.

59
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,520
My son!

60
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,210
Hmm. Lovely melody.

61
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,380
Yes, we like it.

62
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,710
That is Faithful. The song of Lilliput.

63
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,800
It will be played at the wedding tomorrow.

64
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,180
Of course. Of course.

65
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:43,100
What's that, Faithful? Oh, no, no! Forever!

66
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,230
The song of Blefuscu must be
played at the wedding.

67
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,730
But Bombo, Faithful is always
played at our weddings.

68
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,650
It, it's tradition, sir. And it's very pretty.

69
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,410
Yes, yes, I know. Pleasant little ditty,

70
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,830
oh but hardly appropriate for this great occasion.

71
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,620
But Forever! There's a song for you! Ha, ha!

72
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,130
Faithful will be played.

73
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,970
Bah! Fodder. Absolute fodder. It must be Forever!

74
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,800
Faithful.

75
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,260
Forever!

76
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,560
Faithful.

77
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,180
Forever!

78
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,690
Faithful.

79
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,160
It will be Forever, or there will be no wedding!

80
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,580
No wedding? But the cake
and the pretty flowers and..

81
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,410
oh Bombo, you'll love Faithful.

82
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,920
Ahh!

83
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:04,970
It's war!

84
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,450
There's a giant on the beach!

85
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,170
It's war!

86
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,230
War. Woe is me. Woe is me.

87
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,730
I found a mountain, your majesty. I found it!
It was man, a man mountain!

88
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,400
War isn't nice.

89
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,940
It was, was this big!

90
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,530
No, no. It was this big!

91
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,700
People get hurt in wars.

92
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,790
He's as big, as big as, as, big as, as, as..

93
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,330
Wait your majesty!

94
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,790
Bombo can't frighten me. No sir.

95
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,550
Don't stand there like a nincompoop!

96
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,800
I'm trying to tell you that there's a giant!

97
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,260
When I get my dandruff up, then look out.

98
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:35,400
But Glory, poor little Glory.

99
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,830
Don't look now gentleman, but it's war.

100
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,750
War? Whoopee!

101
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,780
Shh!

102
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,900
Shh!

103
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,660
Shh!

104
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,130
War. Ha. Ha. Rolls off my back like a duck.

105
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,750
But, but I'm, but I'm trying to tell ya!

106
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,210
I'm telling ya there's, there's a...

107
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,340
What's on your mind?

108
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,300
I said..

109
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,220
Speak up, man.

110
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,260
There's a giant on the beach!
There's a giant on the beach!

111
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,640
For heaven's sake, Gabby.
Button your mouth.

112
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,520
Can't you see I have a war on my hands?

113
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,520
Be off with you. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

114
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,190
A war?

115
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,320
Do you suppose he could be a, a spy?

116
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,240
Who's a spy? Who's a spy?

117
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,320
THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!

118
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,040
A giant? Giant? Why don't you tell me things?

119
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,500
Do something. Don't stand there.
Go. Sic the dogs on him.

120
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,120
Fetch him to me at once!

121
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,460
Wake up! Wake up!

122
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,500
There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!

123
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,050
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,550
Wake up! Wake up!

Wake up! Wake up!

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,970
A giant on the beach!
Wake up, I tell ya! Wake up!

127
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,390
There's a giant on the beach!

Wake up! Wake up!
Giant on the beach!

129
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,270
Wake up! Wake up! There's a giant on the beach!
A giant on the beach!

130
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
Wake up! Wake up!
There's a giant on the beach!

131
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,400
A giant, on the beach?

132
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,360
A giant?

133
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,320
On the beach?

134
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,280
T-T-There's a, there's a, there's, there's a...

135
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,740
Giant on the beach!

136
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,990
Giant!

137
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,870
It's open!

138
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,500
A giant?

139
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,960
A giant on the beach!

140
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,910
Giant!

141
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,830
On the beach!

142
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,300
I said, "There's a giant on the beach!"

143
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,890
Bring cables and tools.
Bring horses and mules.

144
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,850
Bring snippers and clippers,
ladders and spools.

145
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,140
Bring Derek the rig,
and bring Floyd the jig.

146
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,730
Bring whatchamacallit. Little and big.
A thingamathud. A thingamajig.

147
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,310
And all kinds of things
and stuff like that there.

148
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,860
Follow me!

149
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,900
Shh!

150
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,070
Shh!

151
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,620
Shh!

152
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,290
Hmm!

153
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,230
Shh! Quiet. We're almost there.

154
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,660
Whoaa!

155
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,210
Wh, where, where is it?

156
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,010
I don't know, but it was right here.

157
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,470
Here?

158
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,390
Oh yeah? Well where is it now?

159
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:45,430
Well ah, ah, I can't understand it.
It was right here.

160
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,060
Honest.

161
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,530
Giant, huh! Dragging us out
into the dead of the night.

162
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,740
Yeah, chasing wild geese.

163
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,660
Gabby must have been seeing things.

164
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,330
Maybe it just got up and flew away.

165
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,750
Yeah, and breathing fire.

166
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,090
Look out Gabby.
Your giant's gonna bite ya!

167
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:22,800
Hey, hey fellas, maybe it was me he saw.
Look. I'm a giant! I'm a giant!

168
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,120
Psst!

169
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,370
Psst! Psst! Psst!

170
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,830
Listen.

171
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,800
I-I... t-t-told ya that there was

172
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:50,140
a-a-a gia, a giant on the b-b-beach.

173
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,640
And well, there he is.

174
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,440
Huh?

175
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:56,110
HE SAID, "THAT'S THE GIANT ON THE BEACH!"

176
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,860
Shh!

177
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,240
Shh!

178
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,820
Shh!

179
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,240
There isn't a moment to waste.

180
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,410
Every last man must do all that he can.

181
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,120
Work with the greatest of haste.

182
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,080
So bind up its hands, its arms,
its chest, its neck, its feet!

183
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,660
And I'll do the rest.

184
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,250
Let's go!

185
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,610
Quiet.

186
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,360
Quiet.

187
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,200
Quiet.

188
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,330
Hey?

189
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,420
Shh!

190
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,930
Careful!

191
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,970
Up!

192
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,870
Put him there! No! No! Here!
Don't be afraid man!

193
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,080
Aw! Aw! He got me! He got me!
Aw! Aw! Help! He's killing me!

194
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,290
I don't want to die! Help! Help!
He's killing me! Help!

195
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,670
Hey!

196
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:16,810
Well, what are you rubes waiting for?
Tie him up!

197
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,870
Get the wheel. Come on, roll in the plate.

198
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,040
Bring pegs to hold him.
Bring jacks, tacks, cleats, axe.

199
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,080
All kinds of things and stuff like that there!

200
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:01,430
Come on now! Let's go! Heave, ho!

201
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,580
Up! Up men! Up! Up!

202
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,630
Back up Billy!
Come on, Nicky.

203
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,720
Steady there, Bessie!

204
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,300
Back up, Billy!

205
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,640
Hip! Hip!

206
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,770
Ho!

207
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,360
five, and six, and seven,
and eight, and nine, and oh!

208
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,460
Ready there below? Let's go!

209
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
Giddy up, Susie! Giddy up!

210
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,010
Lower wave in!

211
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,900
Careful! Careful!

212
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,680
All set below!

213
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,730
Okay, let's go!

214
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,570
Giddy up! Tally ho!

215
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,360
Giddy up! Tally ho!

216
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:10,620
Giddy up!

217
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,640
Oh! Oh! Oh!

218
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,850
Pull in the ropes there!

219
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,440
Not so fast! Not so fast!
Hurry up, there! Slow down!

220
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,990
Get the wheels past!

221
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:50,120
Phew! I don't know what they would do
around here without ME!

222
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,910
Ohhhh!

223
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,340
Heave! Heave!

224
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,120
Faithful was always played
at our weddings... Faithful.

225
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,260
Faithful.

226
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,140
Your, your, your majesty.

227
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,510
Huh?

228
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,520
I've got the giant!

229
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:43,110
The giant. Oh, yes, yes, the giant.
Well bring him in. Bring him in.

230
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,440
Okay. Okay.

231
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,320
Your majesty, I don't think he'd fit in here.

232
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,740
Oh you don't, huh?
So it's not good enough for him, hmm?

233
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,580
Well where is he?

234
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,040
Out there, your majesty.

235
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,970
Now, then.

236
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,760
Humph! Not good enough for him!

237
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,660
Well, where is he?

238
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,040
From here. On!

239
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:55,840
Call out the guards, the army, the navy,
women and children first, I'll see you later.

240
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,720
Search him, men. He may be armed.

241
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,930
Ohhhh!

242
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,390
Ugh! Why do I get out held?
Your majesty! Let me in!

243
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:12,310
Look your majesty! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!

244
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,410
Let me in! Let me in!
Help! I don't like this!

245
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,950
Ohhhh!

246
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:31,290
Let me go! Help! Help!
Let me go! I don't wanna die!

247
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,630
Well, well. What have we got here?

248
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,590
Help! Help!
Don't eat me! Don't eat me!

249
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,760
Help! I won't taste good.
I'll give you indigestion.

250
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,850
A man. A tiny man.

251
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,020
You can't do this to me.
I've got a wife and kids.

252
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,640
Millions of kids.

253
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,060
Hold on there, mate.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

254
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:58,070
Help! Put me down! Help! Help!

255
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,990
Drop that! Drop that!

256
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,330
Well, another one. Who are you?

257
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,540
Who me? What? I'm king around here.

258
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,080
Guards! Guards! To the turrets!

259
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,340
Archers! Surround the giant!
Surround the giant! Guards!

260
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:30,480
Well.

261
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,570
Huh! You'll pay for this.

262
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,450
Ready!

263
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,030
Aim, fire. Aim, fire.

264
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,290
Aim!

265
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,870
Fire, fire, fire.

266
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,390
How do you like that?

267
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,690
Want some more?
All right, let her go!

268
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,610
It's Bom

269
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,490
Bo!

270
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,570
Force the gates! Man the battlements!
Defend the city!

271
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,990
We're attacked! We're attacked!

272
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,550
Stop! Stop you swine!

273
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,930
Get back to your posts!
Get back there and fight!

274
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,010
We of Blefuscu are not!

275
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:58,400
afraid of anything.

276
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:09,830
Well, where's everyone gone?

277
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,830
This is no way to treat a harmless visitor.

278
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,930
Look Gabby, we've won! Gabby! Gabby?

279
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:39,400
See Gabby? They've gone.
Yes, sir. Scared stiff.

280
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,710
Hello there.

281
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,550
Come now, don't let my size frighten you.

282
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,680
You, your majesty, surely
you're not afraid of me?

283
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,730
Nuh uh.

284
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,770
Well, good. Then let me present myself.

285
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:27,110
My name is Gulliver, your majesty.
Lemuel Gulliver, a shipwrecked sailor.

286
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,360
At your service.

287
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,030
Well, welcome to Lilliput,
Mr., Mr. Gulliver.

288
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,700
Uh Mr. Gulliver, can you fight?

289
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,210
Well your majesty,
I can lick anybody my size.

290
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,380
Ah, splendid, splendid!

291
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,760
I don't think Bombo will give us any
further trouble while you're around here.

292
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,640
No sir!

293
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,140
He's on our side, Gabby.

294
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,430
He's on our side!

295
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,930
There's nothing to fear!

296
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,400
The man mountain's on our side!

297
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,690
Come on, where are those buttons?

298
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,900
Out of soap! Push him up!

299
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,530
Out of soap! Push him up!

300
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,080
Outta the tub! He's a coming up!

301
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,340
Hey look out! Grab it! Pull it off! Nab it!

302
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,970
Pull it off! Take it off!

303
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,490
You understand that not until
that giant is removed

304
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,280
can our forces taste the sweet fruits of victory!

305
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:31,290
Now then, it is up to you to carry
this message to my spies in Lilliput.

306
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,090
Be off and may luck be with you!

307
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:47,060
Too-de-loo!

308
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,310
Get going!

309
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,310
Your majesty, I'm sorry the
little princess isn't with us.

310
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:40,400
Yes, too bad. Too much
excitement for one day.

311
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:27,280
Dear spies: Get rid of that Giant
or else... Cordially yours King Bombo

312
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,480
Gulliver's thunder machine

313
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,510
Gulliver's thunder machine

314
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:50,040
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy, m...

315
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,800
Ahoy, mate! Ahoy! Ahoy!
I see that you're a sailor boy.

316
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,590
I owned a boat. A beauty, too.

317
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,670
Fifty times as big as your a,

318
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,550
as big as your a,

319
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,680
as big as your shoe.

320
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,310
My, my.

321
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:08,220
Hoy, hoy.

322
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:10,350
Lost her though in a glorious gale,

323
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,440
but I came home on
the back of a whale.

324
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,480
But tell me though how
you caught the whale.

325
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,480
Simply grabbed a hold of his tail.

326
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,450
My, my.

327
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:24,410
I, I,

328
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,700
I climbed a mountain peak so high.

329
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,490
I bumped my head against the sky.

330
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,250
And there I was, where was I?

331
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,250
On the Island of Alibi.

332
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,460
Hoy, hoy.

333
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,550
My, my.

334
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:42,760
Hi, hi.

335
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,760
But now my life is very dull.

336
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:48,640
They ought to make me an admiral.

337
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,270
Now that's the job that I'd enjoy.

338
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,690
I must be going. Ahoy! Ahoy!

339
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:01,570
My, my, my.

340
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,090
You put that ball in there.

341
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,590
And then it goes down and around.

342
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,050
Pull that thing.

343
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:30,850
And it comes out here.

344
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,540
The g-g-g-g-giant!

345
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,040
Wow!

346
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:07,010
The light. The light.
Douse the light!

347
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:31,370
He's gone.

348
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,290
Phew!

349
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,580
Hello! Anybody in there?

350
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,080
Nobody here but just us spi...

351
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,920
Chickens!

352
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,300
My, my.

353
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,300
Forever! Forever!

354
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,850
That's the song of Blefuscu!

355
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:15,550
A spy!

356
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,560
Charge!

357
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,510
A spy!

358
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,770
A spy!

359
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,060
Charge!

360
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,310
A spy! A spy!

361
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,810
Charge!

362
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,690
Where is he? Where did he go?

363
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,310
Concealing a spy.

364
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:09,730
And at a time of war, too.
That makes it worse!

365
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,950
Carry on the search men!

366
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:18,700
Mind you, your father will hear of this.

367
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:54,190
King Bombo,
Say the word and the giant is a dead duck.

368
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,660
..is a dead duck.

369
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,330
P.S. What do we do with the body?

370
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,630
Two hearts and a wedding
broken by a melody?

371
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:13,800
Incredible!

372
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,010
Wait a minute.

373
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:23,600
I have an idea that might turn
this malice to a melody!

374
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,440
Sing Faithful and Forever
together, as one song.

375
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,580
The giant will be a dead duck.

376
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:49,330
Ha! Now we are getting at somewhere!

377
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:56,050
Dear Spies, Destroy. Crush.
Obliterate! Annihilate!

378
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,680
Kill him!

379
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,840
I will attack at dawn!

380
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:05,270
Affectionately yours, Bombo.

381
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,290
Whatcha got there?

382
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:35,050
Attack at dawn. Attack..
Bombo's attack.., Bom..., Bom...

383
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,760
Guards! Guards! Guards!

384
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,220
Bombo's attacking! Bombo's attacking!

385
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,930
Bombo's attacking at dawn!

386
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:44,560
Bombo's attacking! It's war!

387
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,430
Bombo's attacking! It's war! It's war!

388
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:50,310
It's the end of the ending!

389
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,560
To the beach! To the beach!

390
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,150
Bomb.. attacking!

391
01:04:54,310 --> 01:04:55,020
What?

392
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,530
Bombo attacking!

393
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,530
It's war! It's war!

394
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,070
To the beach! To the beach!

395
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:03,490
The enemy attacks!

396
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,040
To defend Lilliput.

397
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,500
To defend Lilliput!

398
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,720
Yes, forward march.

399
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:27,310
Gulliver! Gulliver! Where are you?

400
01:05:27,350 --> 01:05:28,810
Bombo's attacking.

401
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,640
Where are you Gulliver?
We'll be wiped out!

402
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:32,850
Gulliver where are you?

403
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:36,360
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!

404
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:41,450
Gulliver! Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!

405
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,620
It's war! Gulliver! It's war!

406
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:51,330
Gulliver! Where are you?

407
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,130
Gulliver! Gulliver! It's war!

408
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:59,300
Gulliver! Bombo's attacking!
Bombo's attacking! It's war!

409
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,630
Put me down.

410
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:06,220
Hah! Well, where you been you
lazy, long legged, overgrown lummox?

411
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:09,470
Now, get down there to that beach
and wipe out that Bombo

412
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:10,850
and that bunch of Blefuscuians.

413
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,480
And tear em to pieces

414
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,770
and don't leave a man alive
to tell the tale.

415
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,610
Forward march! Get going!

416
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:19,570
Aye, aye, sir!
My, oh my.

417
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,360
Hey! Wait for me.

418
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,570
Gulliver, wait for me!

419
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,040
Wait for me, Gulliver!

420
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,100
No note.

421
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,240
Where is it?

422
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,620
What did you done with it?

423
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,450
Where did you lose it?

424
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,950
Who's got it now?

425
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:56,460
Gulliver! Gulliver! Wait for me!

426
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,790
Gulliver! Gulliver!

427
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,230
Let me go! Let me go!

428
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:31,820
Let's go!

429
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,690
Hold on there!
We can settle this peacefully.

430
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,980
Listen!

431
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,150
Hold you fire!

432
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:09,320
Hear what I have to say.

433
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:34,800
Bombo, order your men
to lay down their arms.

434
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,390
Must I make you listen?

435
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:37,160
David, look! Gulliver's thunder machine.

436
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:55,220
Wait here, Glory.

437
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:58,550
David!

438
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,100
Fire!

439
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,520
Fire!

440
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:34,630
Pull! Come on! Pull! Pull!

441
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,050
David!

442
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,220
Poor, poor, foolish little people.

443
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,220
Look what you've done.

444
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:28,060
Now go ahead! Break your nutshell heads
over your songs!

445
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,770
But did you have to break Glory's heart,
King Little,

446
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,400
because you are thoughtless and selfish?

447
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:40,860
And you Bombo, o mighty warrior,
what have you won?

448
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,410
You were too stubborn to think,

449
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:49,460
too busy quarrelling to lend ear to the
harmony that might have been yours.

450
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,760
But now in your sorrow and despair,

451
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,010
perhaps you will listen to your songs
as they might be sung.

452
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,990
In behalf of the peoples of
Blefuscu and Lilliput,

453
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:51,330
With eternal gratitude and love in our hearts,
we christen thee, Gulliver!

454
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:14,080
— The End —
