1
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,163
What a quiet place!

2
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,251
Indeed yes, very quiet.
Very quiet.

3
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,420
There's your bathroom, Miss.

4
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,179
I see we have the same bathroom.

5
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,850
I think I had better
introduce myself.

6
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,978
I'm Vera Claythorne,
Mrs. Owen's secretary.

7
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,355
Oh. My name is Emily Brent.

8
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,818
Is there anything
you want, Miss?

9
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,988
Well, I'd like to see Mrs. Owen.

10
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,702
I'm Mrs. Owen's new secretary.
I expect you know that.

11
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:30,039
No Miss, I don't know anything.

12
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,458
Just the list of the
ladies and gentlemen

13
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,043
who are invited for the weekend.

14
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,462
Didn't Mrs. Owen mention me?

15
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,965
I haven't seen Mrs. Owen yet.

16
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,135
We only came here
a few days ago.

17
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,723
This is a large house.
What staff have you here?

18
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,309
Just me and Rogers, Miss.

19
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,245
Does Mr. Owen
know we've arrived?

20
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,582
- He's not here yet, sir.
- Where is Mrs. Owen?

21
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,667
They were delayed
in London, sir.

22
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,587
I got a letter.
They'll be here for dinner.

23
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,714
Eight o'clock, sir.

24
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,223
We tell the story in Ireland,
about the two Englishmen

25
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,768
who were cast away on a
desert island for 3 years

26
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,937
and never spoke to each other,

27
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,606
because they hadn't
been introduced.

28
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,024
I'm not English!

29
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,276
My name is Prince
Nikita Starloff.

30
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,028
Call me Nicky.

31
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,531
Well, that breaks
the ice, gentlemen.

32
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,200
I am Judge Quinncannon.

33
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,539
How do you do, sir.
I'm Dr. Armstrong.

34
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:57,376
My name is Lombard.
Philip Lombard.

35
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,213
I'm General Mandrake.

36
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,965
Sir John Mandrake,
isn't it General?

37
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,717
Some years ago,
I was called in consultation.

38
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,719
Your wife was ill.

39
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,806
My wife is dead, sir!

40
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,559
If you gentlemen will be
good enough to follow me,

41
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,727
I will show you to your rooms.

42
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,484
I'm afraid I didn't
catch your name.

43
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,486
- Blore.
- Blore?

44
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,575
- William Henry Blore.
- Oh, Philip Lombard.

45
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,660
I'm afraid you've
got the wrong bag!

46
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,079
You're very observing,
Mr. Blore.

47
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,749
C.M., Charles Morley.
An old friend of mine.

48
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,086
I like his taste.
I even borrow his clothes.

49
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,810
Oh excuse me, Doctor. I thought
that this was a closet.

50
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,937
It seems we are
sharing a bathroom.

51
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,106
Oh, I didn't know.

52
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,359
The only time I regret
being a bachelor

53
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,944
is when I have to
dress for dinner.

54
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,614
- Ah, let me help you.
- Thank you.

55
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,283
Do you know this part
of the English coast?

56
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,534
No. I can't say I do.

57
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:14,369
Something magical
about an island.

58
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,331
Yes, they're like
a world of its own.

59
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,875
How would you like to spend
your last days here?

60
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,670
Oh no thanks, I think a
weekend will be enough.

61
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,633
We all build islands
of imagination.

62
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,343
Represents escape.

63
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,136
Half of my patients are sick

64
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,222
because they're trying
to escape reality.

65
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:36,725
- Well, and what's your answer?
- Oh, I tell them fairytales.

66
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,561
I build them islands of
imagined security.

67
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,649
Don't you believe in
medicine, Doctor?

68
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,235
Do you believe in
justice, Judge?

69
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,911
- Mr. Blore?
- Yes?

70
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,080
The bathroom's yours.

71
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,479
- Do you think they're done?
- Done enough for them.

72
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,648
Ethel.

73
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,526
Don't stand there gawking.
Get 'em up.

74
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,404
Did you wash the
floor this morning?

75
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,282
Do you suppose I have
time for everything?

76
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,410
It's not right to go inviting
a house full of guests.

77
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,871
I'll talk to Mr. Owen
when he comes.

78
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,540
You tell him, we're quitting.

79
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,544
The agency didn't tell us the
house was so big and so lonely.

80
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,463
- You knew it was an island.
- Hmph! With only one house.

81
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,300
Makes me nervous. Here!

82
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,970
What they don't know
won't hurt 'em.

83
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,265
Everyone has to eat a speck
of dirt before they die.

84
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:10,861
Ladies and Gentlemen,
May I propose a toast

85
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,573
to our gracious hostess,
Mrs. Owen.

86
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,327
Uh oh, Doctor! I saw you.
You drank water.

87
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,330
- That's bad luck.
- Water never hurt anyone, sir.

88
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,332
Especially in my profession.

89
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,501
Don't forget the
old proverb, doctor.

90
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,670
Never trust a man
who doesn't drink.

91
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,173
Sounds like the Bible.
Great book.

92
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:36,261
And now I give you our
charming host, Mr. Owen.

93
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,846
Jolly good fellow!

94
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,017
And I hope, sir, that will
conclude all possible toasts.

95
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,144
Tell me, Miss Claythorne,

96
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,438
why do they call this
place Indian Island?

97
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,065
I don't know.

98
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,109
Excuse me, sir, the boatman

99
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,945
told me it's because it's shaped
like the head of an Indian.

100
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,783
Oh, that accounts
for the little Indians!

101
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,034
- Indians!

102
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,704
We must have a toast, sir.
I drink to the Indians.

103
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,123
Each little Indian,
individually.

104
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,877
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
Ten little Indians!

105
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,381
Ten little Indians!
It's like the nursery rhyme.

106
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,717
Ten little Indian boys
went out to dine

107
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,553
one choked his little self
and then there were nine.

108
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,222
Oh poor little fellow.

109
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,891
Here's to him. And what
happened to the others?

110
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,394
Nine little Indian boys
sat up very late

111
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,813
one overslept himself and
then there were eight.

112
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,064
Then what happened?

113
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,066
You will find the rhymes
on the piano.

114
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,653
Mr. Owen seems to be
fond of little Indians.

115
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,573
(Ten little Indians)

116
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,995
Eight little Indian boys
traveling in Devon.

117
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,333
One said he'd stay right there
and then there were seven.

118
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:53,588
Seven little Indian boys
chopping up some sticks.

119
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:59,428
Till one chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

120
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,352
Six little Indian boys
playing with a hive.

121
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:11,773
A bumblebee stung one of
them and then there were five.

122
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:16,611
Five little Indian boys
going in for law.

123
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:22,284
Now one got in Chancery
and then there were four.

124
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:30,041
Four little Indian boys
going out to sea.

125
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,629
A red herring swallowed one
and then there were three.

126
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:39,718
Three little Indian boys
walking in the zoo.

127
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:45,891
A big bear hugged one
and then there were two.

128
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,143
The place for nursery rhymes
is in the nursery.

129
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,979
Don't worry judge,
he's down to the last Indian.

130
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:54,483
Two Little Indian boys
sitting in the sun.

131
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:59,404
One got all frizzled up
and then there was one.

132
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:06,077
One little Indian boy
left all alone.

133
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,251
So he went and hanged himself

134
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,337
and then...

135
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,839
there...

136
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,677
WGTG DONG.

137
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,686
Silence please,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

138
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,439
This is your host
Mr. Owen speaking.

139
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,359
You are charged with
the following crimes.

140
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,278
General Sir John Mandrake:

141
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,532
that you did deliberately
send your wife's lover,

142
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,284
Lieutenant Arthur Masefield
to his death.

143
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,953
Emily Brent:

144
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,455
that you did cause and
bring about the death

145
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,541
of your young nephew,
Peter Brent.

146
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,877
Dr. Edward G Armstrong:

147
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,630
that through
uncontrolled drunkenness

148
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,633
you did kill Mrs. Mary Cleese.

149
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,886
Prince Nikita Starloff:

150
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,305
that you are guilty
of the murder

151
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,474
of Fred and Lucy Marlowe.

152
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,227
Vera Claythorne:

153
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,146
that you did murder
your sister's fiancé,

154
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,898
Richard Barclay.

155
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:21,152
Judge Francis J. Quinncannon:

156
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,822
that you were responsible
for the death

157
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,741
by hanging of one Edward Seaton.

158
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,660
Philip Lombard:

159
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,913
that you are guilty of
the deaths of 21 men,

160
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,082
members of an
East African tribe.

161
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,334
William H Blore:

162
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,004
that by perjuring your testimony

163
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,423
you did bring about the
death of James Landor.

164
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,758
Thomas and Ethel Rogers:

165
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,927
that you brought about the death

166
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:50,098
of your invalid employer,
Mrs. Jennifer Brady.

167
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,185
Prisoners at the bar of justice

168
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,023
have you anything to
say in your defense?

169
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:15,624
Silence please, Ladies and
Gentlemen.

170
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,209
This is your host, Mr. Owen.

171
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,547
What's going on here?

172
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,383
What kind of a
practical joke is this?

173
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,968
It's on the record.

174
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,639
An outrageous lie.

175
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,065
It's called Swan Song.

176
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,568
May I ask who put it
on the gramophone?

177
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,487
- I did, sir.
- Why?

178
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,990
I didn't know what it was.
On my oath I didn't know! I

179
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,993
I was just obeying orders, sir.
That's all.

180
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,579
- Who's orders?
- Mr. Owen's.

181
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,165
Now let's get this quite clear.

182
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,669
Mr. Owen's orders
were what exactly?

183
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,381
To put the record on at
9 o'clock. It was sealed up.

184
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,841
I I thought it was
just a piece of music.

185
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,094
It's the truth, sir!

186
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,180
I haven't seen Mr. Owen.
I was telling my wife.

187
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,433
I told you we shouldn't have
come here! I want to get away!

188
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,436
- I won't touch that money!
- Shut up!

189
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,273
First thing to do, Rogers,
is to get your wife to bed.

190
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,739
May I have your
attention please.

191
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,868
This letter to Rogers
is signed by Mr. U N Owen.

192
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,622
I must confess I don't
know Mr. Owen personally.

193
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,208
What kind of a man is he?

194
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,297
Who knows him?

195
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,387
Ha ha. You all came to a house
and you don't know the host!

196
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,889
What about yourself,
Your Highness?

197
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,227
Oh, with me, it's different.
I am a professional guest.

198
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,814
I knew we shouldn't
have come here!

199
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,149
Quiet, Ethel!

200
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,651
I knew somebody would
find out about it some day!

201
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,820
- I told you!
- Shut up, I tell you!

202
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,991
She's quite out of
her head, Doctor.

203
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:19,914
Hysteria induced by shock.
Give her this sedative.

204
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,084
1O drops in half
a glass of water.

205
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,919
Yes, sir.

206
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,338
If she doesn't sleep, repeat
the dose in 2 hours.

207
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,550
Oh, I hope she'll sleep, Doctor.

208
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,433
Dr. Armstrong, we've taken all
the evidence except your own.

209
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,852
What's your reason
for being here?

210
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,772
Quite frankly, I came
here professionally.

211
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,776
I received a letter from
Mr. Owen, asking me to come here

212
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,111
and spend the weekend
and pretend to be a guest

213
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,782
so that I might examine his wife
who had refused to see a doctor.

214
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,201
<i>I'll</i> summarize our findings.

215
00:17:56,326 --> 00:18:00,622
We've all received letters
from old trusted friends.

216
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,958
Inviting us to spend
the weekend here.

217
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,377
As guests of their
friends, the Owens.

218
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,215
Miss Claythorne was
employed through an agency

219
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,966
and told to report to Mrs. Owen.

220
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,637
This letter to Mr. Lombard
is the only one directly

221
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,890
from Mr. Owen. Very peculiar.

222
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,310
I might even
call it threatening.

223
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,728
What do you say?

224
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,898
I say that the only person
whose presence here

225
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,234
hasn't been explained
is that gentleman.

226
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:33,238
Well Your Honor, I see no
reason to conceal it any longer.

227
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,989
I'm here to do a job.

228
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,574
- I was hired.
- By whom?

229
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,159
This man, Owen.

230
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,161
You saw him?

231
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,914
No. He enclosed a fat
money order with that

232
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,416
and someone to
join the house party

233
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,918
and to pose as
one of the guests.

234
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,672
I run a detective agency in
Plymouth! I got me credentials!

235
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,591
Look here, Judge.

236
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:59,264
All of these letters refer to
our host as U N Owen. U N Owen!

237
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,349
Unknown

238
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,601
Yes, Mr. Unknown has not only

239
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,896
enticed us here under false
pretenses but he's taken the

240
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,190
trouble to find out a
great deal about us all.

241
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,276
- That's a lie!
- It's a fantastical idea!

242
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,824
Listen, my friends.
The accusation is true!

243
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,578
Now I remember.
A year ago

244
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,621
two people in the road

245
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,708
I was driving fast, fast, fast!

246
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,879
- What happened?
- They took my license away.

247
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:34,883
- What about the two people?
- I ran over them.

248
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,634
Beastly bad luck.

249
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:52,150
I'm still not clear as to the
purpose of our unknown host

250
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,736
in getting us to assemble here.
In my opinion,

251
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,322
this person whoever he
may be is not of normal mind.

252
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,157
He may be dangerous.

253
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,533
I think it would be wise

254
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,910
for us all to leave this
island immediately.

255
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,328
I quite agree, sir.

256
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,080
Rogers, how soon can we get
the boat from the mainland?

257
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,166
I can't, sir.
There's no telephone.

258
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,084
The boat only comes
twice a week, sir.

259
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,836
It won't come again
until Monday.

260
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,172
And this is only Friday.

261
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,675
- There's no boats here?
- No, sir.

262
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,677
Why do you want to leave,
my friends?

263
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,263
Why don't we get to the
bottom of this mystery?

264
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,766
It's wonderful! Really!

265
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,684
At our time of life, sir,

266
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,853
we have no desire for
thrills as you call them.

267
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,023
Your legal mind has lost
its taste for adventure.

268
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,692
I am all for crime, Your Honor.

269
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:40,657
May I propose a toast:
Here is to crime!

270
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:03,888
How perfectly disgusting!
Drinks like an animal.

271
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,225
- Huh? What did you say?
- He's not moving.

272
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,394
Just plain drunk.

273
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,232
Just plain dead.

274
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,736
- What did the doctor say?
- Dead.

275
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,405
What?

276
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,932
What are you looking at, Rogers?

277
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,601
It's broken, sir.

278
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,353
You'll have more than that

279
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,439
to report to the owner
of this house.

280
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,190
But Mr. Owen isn't
the owner, sir.

281
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,359
He's only leased
it for the weekend.

282
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,696
Ah, then you know
more than you told us.

283
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,282
Come, come, Rogers,

284
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,951
are you quite sure that there
is no one else on this island?

285
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:10,705
- I'd swear to it, sir.
- I believe you Rogers.

286
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,208
But I'm afraid your story will
be questioned by the police.

287
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,979
Don't touch!

288
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,151
I thought you'd gone
to bed, Mr. Blore.

289
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,403
In our profession,

290
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,656
Doctor, we don't always
do what we appear to do.

291
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,575
Perhaps it the same in yours.

292
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,911
Why don't you want me
To touch that glass?

293
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,788
I thought it would
be inadvisable

294
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,165
for you to have your
fingerprints on it.

295
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,334
Smell it.

296
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:06,094
- Lethal solution.
- Suicide?

297
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,681
That, I believe comes under
your profession, sir.

298
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,117
Doctor!

299
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,619
Doctor Armstrong!

300
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,038
- Doctor Armstrong!
- What is it, Rogers?

301
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,040
It's the wife, sir.
She doesn't look right to me.

302
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,792
Go ahead <i>I'll</i> follow you.

303
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,475
Good morning, Miss Brent.

304
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,477
I hope you slept
better than I did.

305
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:58,563
I slept very well, thank you.

306
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,565
I have nothing on my conscience.

307
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,651
Good morning, General.

308
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,320
Good morning.

309
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,740
General Mandrake!

310
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:16,831
Yes, Juliet?
Oh! Forgive me, young lady.

311
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,917
I was thinking of my wife.

312
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,588
Good morning, Miss Claythorne.
What about breakfast?

313
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,339
Do you mind if I
sit down like this?

314
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,430
Morning, Judge.
Morning, Miss Brent.

315
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,348
Good morning.

316
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,350
What? Is something worrying you?

317
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,186
I don't understand it.

318
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,104
There are a lot of things,
I don't understand, sir!

319
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,689
These little figures.

320
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,274
How many were
there last night? Ten?

321
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,692
- Ten.
- Yes, ten.

322
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:48,613
Rogers found one broken
after after what happened.

323
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,284
- And now, how many do you see?
- Eight.

324
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,037
- Only eight.
- That's what I counted.

325
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,123
Oh, let Mr. Owen worry about it.
They're his Indians.

326
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,708
- What about breakfast?
- I afraid

327
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,710
you'll have to go
without breakfast.

328
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,047
Mrs. Rogers died in her sleep.

329
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,381
- What?
- What?

330
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,133
- How?
- Heart failure?

331
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,302
Her heart certainly
failed to beat.

332
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,554
What caused it to fail,
I cannot say.

333
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:14,889
Conscience?

334
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,141
Oh conscience, my eye.
What about her husband?

335
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,894
He was scared to death,
for fear his wife would talk.

336
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,482
I'm sorry. I'm sorry there's
no breakfast prepared.

337
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,400
But you see, my wife

338
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,736
- it's all right, Rogers.
- We understand.

339
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:35,243
But I thought you told us,
he was dead.

340
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,745
- His wife.
- Eh?

341
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:40,998
- His wife!
- Wife?

342
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,172
No, no, no. I don't think a man
would ever kill his wife.

343
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:52,343
No matter how guilty she was.

344
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,933
The wicked flee when
no man pursueth.

345
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:03,521
Two accidental deaths in
12 hours? I don't believe it!

346
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,107
Nor I! What do you say, Judge?

347
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,944
How does the rhyme go,
Miss Claythorne?

348
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,697
Ten Little Indians ...?

349
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,117
One choked his little self
and then were nine.

350
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,289
- Go on
- One overslept himself.

351
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:24,375
And then there were eight.

352
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,467
We are eight people
on this island now.

353
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,402
- Lombard!
- <i>I'll</i> be ready in a minute!

354
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,070
Take your time!

355
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,907
- You know I got it?
- Got what?

356
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,244
There's one thing this
fellow Owen forgot.

357
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,246
This island is just a bare rock.

358
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,165
We'll catch that raving maniac.

359
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,834
He would have to be a fool
to stay on the island.

360
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,003
You mean Rogers is lying?

361
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:11,380
Why not? The man's scared,

362
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,174
scared out of his senses,
that's obvious.

363
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,176
That's why I think that
he is telling the truth.

364
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,595
A lunatic like Owen could
have found a hiding place

365
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,013
before Rogers arrived here.

366
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,349
It doesn't matter if
Rogers is lying or not.

367
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,685
You agree that Mr. Owen
Esquire is hiding, don't' you.

368
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,438
He'll certainly be dangerous.
We ought to be armed.

369
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,358
Yes, too bad we're not allowed
to carry firearms in England.

370
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,860
It puts the normal citizen
at a great disadvantage.

371
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,529
You mean you
haven't any weapon?

372
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,198
You know Blore, it's strange,

373
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,116
but I came to the same
conclusion you did.

374
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,787
Mr. Owen is hiding,
maybe inside this house.

375
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,789
He appears to have an
accomplice, hasn't he?

376
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:46,624
If you ask me, Rogers

377
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:57,301
I have a feeling I'm
being watched. Secretly.

378
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,337
What do you see?

379
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:38,217
I I thought heard
a strange voice.

380
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,345
Gentlemen, I have come
to the conclusion that

381
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:44,181
the invisible Mr. Owen is hiding
somewhere on this island.

382
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:48,018
Extraordinary. I was looking for
you to tell you the same thing.

383
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,438
- That's what I think, sir.
- Me too.

384
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,356
We've all come to
the same opinion.

385
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,025
We must find his
place of concealment.

386
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,528
Immediately. So long as
there's a lunatic at large,

387
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,363
we are in mortal danger.

388
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,964
Do you hear that?

389
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:30,561
Hello, puss. Looking
for a mouse? So are we.

390
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:35,316
What I'd like to know is whether
we're the cat or the mouse.

391
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:41,405
Nobody in the General's room,
not even the General.

392
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,115
I wonder where the old boy is.

393
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,993
I don't know. I don't think he
even knows where he is himself.

394
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:55,419
Nothing in there
but the Russian.

395
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,004
I keep hearing that song

396
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,089
he was singing last night
just before he popped off.

397
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,174
- Ten Little Indians?
- Yes.

398
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:01,842
It certainly was his swan song.

399
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:11,852
One thing is certain.
He isn't inside.

400
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,437
Therefore, he must be outside.

401
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,272
- Brilliant thinking, Blore!
- Eh?

402
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,888
I'm afraid it's no use
watching for the boat.

403
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,140
It won't come till Monday.

404
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,393
No boat will ever come, Juliet.

405
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:57,731
We're here forever.
What made you love him, Juliet?

406
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,733
Sir John!

407
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:06,907
Oh. Forgive me, my child.
You don't understand.

408
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,600
- Nobody!
- Not a living thing.

409
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,351
Not even a hiding place.

410
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,025
Not even a seagull
could hide down there.

411
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,111
- I don't understand it.
- Maybe we've been wrong.

412
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,196
Building a nightmare
out of imagination.

413
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,532
Two people dead
isn't imagination.

414
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,284
The Russian may have
committed suicide.

415
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,869
And Mrs. Rogers?

416
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:56,290
Well, you didn't give an
overdose last night, did you?

417
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,543
Doctors can't afford to
make mistakes of that kind.

418
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,879
We cannot blunder as
detectives sometimes do.

419
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,380
It wouldn't be
your first mistake

420
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,799
if that gramophone
record is to be believed.

421
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,469
Gentlemen, gentlemen this
is no time for quarrelling.

422
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,722
- Let's face it we're in a trap.
- You shouldn't forget

423
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,641
the ten little Indians
on the dinner table.

424
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,310
That's right. Mr. Owen's
hand is plain to see.

425
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,022
Yes, but where the devil
is Mr. Owen himself?

426
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,491
If Mr. Owen is on this island,
he'll catch his death of cold.

427
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,160
If that's supposed to be a joke,
I don't see the point.

428
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,996
All we have to do is to keep
quiet and we'll hear him sneeze.

429
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,414
Oh.

430
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,753
I'm sorry it's only
cold meat and salad.

431
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,505
I did the best I could.

432
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,256
- Okay, Rogers.
- Oh we understand.

433
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,512
- Rogers we're only seven today.
- I'm sorry miss.

434
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,598
You called General Mandrake?

435
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,434
I looked in his room, Miss,
but he's not there.

436
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,522
- Didn't he come in the house?
- I didn't see him, Doctor.

437
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,857
Last time I saw, he was
mooning around on the beach.

438
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,860
- He seemed quite abnormal.
- I know where he is.

439
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,696
You stay here, Miss Claythorne.

440
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:17,204
You say the General was
behaving very strangely?

441
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,208
- Like a man out of his mind.
- In other words, a lunatic.

442
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,377
Right ho, the old boy's barmy.

443
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,630
Whom the Gods destroy,
they first make mad.

444
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,135
Well? Aren't we
looking for a lunatic?

445
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,638
He said no boat will ever come.

446
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,724
Then he knows something.

447
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,144
Maybe he's not as crazy
as we think he is.

448
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,489
Doctor, you better come with me.

449
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:55,075
Don't wait for us.

450
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,661
And don't wait for the
General any longer.

451
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,338
Poisoned glass could
mean suicide.

452
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:12,051
An overdose of sedative might
have been an accident.

453
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,429
But this instrument,

454
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:19,099
which you saw me remove from
the back of the third victim

455
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:23,353
means only one thing: murder.

456
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,151
Or an act of God.

457
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:34,198
My dear lady, in my
experience of ill doing,

458
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,077
Providence means the work of
punishment to us mortals.

459
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,956
Evidently, Mr. Owen believes
we are guilty of certain crimes,

460
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,958
which the law cannot touch

461
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,628
and he's appointed himself
to execute justice.

462
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,714
That is why he has
enticed us to this island.

463
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,967
There's no one on this island.
I tell you. No one.

464
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,887
- Doctor. Doctor Armstrong!
- What is it, man?

465
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,476
There's another little
Indian figure missing.

466
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,480
- That accounts for the General.
- I was expecting that.

467
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,817
You just said there's
no one on this island.

468
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,152
In a sense you may know.

469
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,740
Nevertheless, I am now
certain that Mr. Owen is here.

470
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,325
How can he be here?

471
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,577
I don't believe in
the invisible man.

472
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,371
He's not invisible.

473
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,666
Mr. Owen could only come
to this island in one way.

474
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,459
It's perfectly clear.

475
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:32,673
Mr. Owen is one of us.

476
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,602
Do you have to do that?

477
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,146
I'm just studying
Mr. Owen's little scheme.

478
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,481
Maybe you know how
the General was killed.

479
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,233
My dear Blore, can't you read?

480
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,569
Eight little Indians boys
traveling in Devon,

481
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,239
One said he'd stay there
and then there were seven.

482
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,743
The old soldier
stayed here, didn't he?

483
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,671
Am I disturbing
your little game?

484
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:55,923
Not at all, Blore.

485
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,508
Nothing clears the mind
like a game of precision.

486
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,093
What game are
you playing, judge?

487
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,596
We've come to the conclusion,
the doctor and I,

488
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,766
that this whole story is
a game of the mind.

489
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:10,437
There we are. Eight of us
came to this island.

490
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,690
The Rogers were waiting for us.

491
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,776
Don't forget, waiting for us.

492
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,362
One of the ten is Mr. Owen.

493
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,489
We agree on that.

494
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,034
Out of all of us, three persons
are definitely cleared.

495
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,120
- Who?
- The dead ones.

496
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:33,085
Our Russian friend,
Mrs. Rogers and the General.

497
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:38,715
- Seven little Indians left.
- Six. One is bogus.

498
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:42,719
Correct, sir.
One of us is Mr. Owen.

499
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,973
Which one?

500
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,641
Where's your alibi?

501
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,310
I'm not like you Mr. Blore. I am
a well known professional man.

502
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,438
My dear doctor, that
proves less than nothing.

503
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:55,983
I too am a well known person.

504
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,944
But doctors have
gone mad before now.

505
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:02,531
Judges have gone mad
and so have policemen.

506
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,909
And, may I say, explorers,
Mr. Lombard?

507
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:07,327
You may. You may.

508
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,162
Why do you leave
Miss Claythorne out of it?

509
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,998
- We don't.
- Nor you, my dear lady.

510
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,916
Well, I quite appreciate
that nobody can be

511
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,377
- exonerated without proof.
- What about Rogers?

512
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:18,255
- That's what I was thinking.
- What do we know about him?

513
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,881
He put that record on the
gramophone, didn't he.

514
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,425
That's a fact.

515
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,760
How do we know Rogers
didn't lease this house

516
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,512
and pretend to be the butler?

517
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,265
Oh, no, no, no.
Bad psychology!

518
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,350
You can rule
Rogers out definitely.

519
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,936
- I don't see why.
- Look at the shape of his head.

520
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,604
He hasn't the brains for it.

521
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,523
And don't forget there's
something else, sir.

522
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,108
My wife was one of the victims.

523
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:41,528
In my time, Rogers,
I've had several husbands

524
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,780
before me guilty of the
murder of their wives.

525
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,533
Well, if you put it
that way, sir, they...

526
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,618
they do sometimes
drive a man crazy.

527
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:51,121
We must suspect each
and everyone among us.

528
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,916
Now, I warn everybody to
be on his guard. If not

529
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:01,965
We shall all go the same way.

530
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:09,723
And Mr. Owen will very soon
be alone on this island.

531
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,814
E flat, Miss Claythorne.

532
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,069
Aren't you afraid the others

533
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,279
will think your
playing inappropriate.

534
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,948
I can't stand the silence.
I have to do something.

535
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,325
Go on playing-

536
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,423
If it's any comfort to you,

537
00:39:43,507 --> 00:39:45,759
there's one person who
doesn't suspect you.

538
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,011
Thank you.

539
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,888
Aren't you going to
return the compliment?

540
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,766
I haven't made up my mind
about you, Mr. Lombard.

541
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,019
Whom do you suspect?

542
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,441
The one nearest the fire.

543
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:09,616
- I think you're wrong.
- Well, who then?

544
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,953
A man who believes
in punishing crimes.

545
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,915
His brain might snap and
he'd want to be executioner.

546
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,209
After having been a judge.

547
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,011
Rogers, I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

548
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,679
Did you

549
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:18,518
- prepare a nice dinner?
- Just cold meat, sir.

550
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,980
I see. I'm sure you
do your best, Rogers.

551
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,276
Is there plenty of food
for the weekend?

552
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,779
Oh, yes, sir. Everything
was provided for.

553
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,283
Oh, Mr. Blore, may I
ask you a question?

554
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,535
Of course, of course,
my dear fellow.

555
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,747
How many will you be
for dinner tonight?

556
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,877
But Oh, I see what
you mean. Yes.

557
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,229
Don't forget your vote, Rogers.

558
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:05,398
In a case like this, a secret
vote is the only way

559
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:08,568
to bring out into the open
how we are all thinking.

560
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:17,452
No, no, no. Never touch it. No.
But under the circumstances.

561
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,753
Now, whom do we suspect
of being Mr. Owen?

562
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,801
Mr. Lombard, one vote.

563
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,680
Mr. Blore, one vote.

564
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,268
Dr. Armstrong, one vote.

565
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,188
Rogers, one vote.

566
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,527
Miss Brent, one vote.

567
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:57,826
I see I haven't been neglected.
One vote.

568
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,746
Another vote for you.
Rogers. You win.

569
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:06,543
You mean, sir, that
I am being accused?

570
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,962
Well, it's not
precisely a majority,

571
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,880
but you have the most votes.

572
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:13,008
They're saying its me,
because I'm only a butler.

573
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,135
You said I didn't have
the brains to do it.

574
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,637
- I didn't vote for you, Rogers.
- Well, who did then?

575
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,974
Who didn't drink the cocktail
you just served?

576
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:23,560
You think I poisoned
those cocktails?

577
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,730
<i>I'll</i> show you, sir.

578
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,652
Picking on an innocent man!

579
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,075
I can't touch even
a drop of alcohol.

580
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,080
And if that's what
you think of me,

581
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,832
I'm not going to
serve any dinner.

582
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,584
Oh, Rogers, come back here!

583
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,961
You can't do that!

584
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,769
Don't look so offended, Rogers.

585
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,772
If it had been
anybody but you, sir.

586
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,273
I'm sorry, Rogers.

587
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:12,275
But, how do I know that
you didn't vote for me?

588
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:16,738
I didn't, Your Honor.
I voted for well

589
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,114
Time will tell.

590
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,867
After all, Rogers, nobody in
this house is above suspicion.

591
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,580
Never in my life, have I been
accused of any crime, sir.

592
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,957
What about that
gramophone record?

593
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:31,586
What about it?

594
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,797
That woman you worked for,

595
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,299
she left you some
money, didn't she?

596
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,220
Let's not stand on
our dignity, Rogers.

597
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,389
After all, she was sick.

598
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:48,228
Didn't you shorten her
suffering in this world?

599
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:53,066
With the complicity, of course,
of poor Mrs. Rogers?

600
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:56,569
I'm not going to
argue with you, sir.

601
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:00,323
But what makes you think
I would kill anybody

602
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,909
who wasn't going to
leave me any money?

603
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,789
No, thank you.

604
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,253
Pardon me.

605
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,763
Obviously, we can't
sit up all night, like this.

606
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,893
I'm going to retire. Good night.

607
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,609
If you don't mind,
I'll say good night too.

608
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,864
If you don't mind,
Miss Claythorne,

609
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,116
I would rather
go upstairs alone.

610
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:46,619
May I remind you, Miss Brent,
that I am the only one

611
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,788
whose name wasn't
mentioned in the voting.

612
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:52,417
That's what I mean.
I find that fact most peculiar.

613
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:55,044
I know Miss Brent won't mind
if there's a third person.

614
00:45:55,128 --> 00:45:57,630
Not so fast, Mr. Lombard.
<i>I'll</i> go with you.

615
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,133
- The more the merrier.
- And safer.

616
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:28,745
- Warm in here, isn't it?
- Yes, quite warm, quite warm.

617
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,080
And lonely.

618
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,417
Yes, quite lonely,
quite quite lonely.

619
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:37,796
- Rogers!
- Yes, sir?

620
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:42,008
Oh, would you mind keeping us
company for a while?

621
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,511
Anything you wish, sir.

622
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,683
- Don't put any water in it.
- I shan't, sir.

623
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,438
Good night, Miss Claythorne.

624
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:57,357
Don't forget to lock your door.

625
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,526
You cannot lock out the devil.

626
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,280
I think there's another
one who's barmy.

627
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,367
It's going to end with the
whole lot going that way.

628
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,118
I don't fancy you will, Blore.

629
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,705
No. It takes a lot to
send me off my head.

630
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:16,125
I don't think you'll be
going that way, either.

631
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:19,045
I feel quite sane at the moment.
Thank you.

632
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,636
- Have you told him?
- Yes, sir.

633
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,222
I know the jury's decision.

634
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:33,935
You'll feel safer if I didn't
stay inside the house tonight.

635
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,938
Well then, I shall sleep
in the woodshed.

636
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,234
And now, if you'll excuse me.
Good night.

637
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:59,586
- <i>I'll</i> lock it behind him.
- That's not enough, Mr. Blore.

638
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,177
Still seven.
Lock that door, please.

639
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,765
Put the key there.

640
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:17,186
We'll have no more
Indian tricks tonight.

641
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,692
Lock it, Mr. Blore.

642
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,532
No wait! Now no one can
get in there but you.

643
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:33,953
Oh, I see.
But, who's going to keep it?

644
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:47,717
- Rogers! Open up, Rogers!
- Keep away from that door.

645
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,720
It's me, Lombard! Open up!

646
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,890
Do you take me for a fool,
Mr. Lombard?

647
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:57,477
- Don't be silly, Rogers!
- Don't be silly yourself, sir.

648
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,563
- This is Judge Quinncannon,
- You know my voice, Rogers!

649
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:02,732
- Doctor Armstrong!
- This is Blore, Rogers.

650
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,150
Open the door!

651
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,319
At a time like this,
I wouldn't open the door

652
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,571
even if it was Santa Claus.

653
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,239
We just want to give you a key.

654
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,825
- What for?
- Never mind, you idiot!

655
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:14,827
Hurry up! It's raining!

656
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:18,831
Shove it
under the door, sir.

657
00:49:25,088 --> 00:49:27,632
Good night, Rogers.
Keep your door locked.

658
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,259
Don't worry about me, sir.

659
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:54,283
- Ohhh, be careful, Judge.
- Oh, I shall.

660
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:57,912
You know, the common cold
kills more people than

661
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,082
Never mind.

662
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,383
I need hardly advise
you to lock you doors.

663
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,218
And put a chair
under the handle.

664
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:15,054
There are ways of turning
locks from the outside.

665
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,684
And if it should turn out that
one of you is Mr. Owen,

666
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,812
just remember I'm
a very light sleeper.

667
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,648
- Good night.
- Good night, gentlemen.

668
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,027
May we all meet
safely in the morning.

669
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,320
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

670
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:12,028
Miss Brent! Miss Brent!

671
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,197
She doesn't answer!

672
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,783
- Is her door locked?
- Of course, try it!

673
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,079
She's not here!

674
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:24,123
You grasp the fact
very quickly, Blore.

675
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:26,042
What's wrong, Mr. Blore?

676
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,877
- Miss Brent's missing.
- I knocked on all your doors,

677
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,295
she was the only one
that didn't answer.

678
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,713
What's wrong with that?
It's late.

679
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:32,131
We all overslept.

680
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:34,634
I heard her get up.
She must gone downstairs.

681
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,981
- I locked that door last night.
- Who opened it?

682
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,483
Look.

683
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:56,322
Good morning.
It's such a pretty pattern.

684
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,116
I thought I'd like to copy
it for a new shawl.

685
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,326
Was that door locked
when you went out?

686
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,912
- Oh, yes, I opened it.
- Good morning, Miss Brent.

687
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,498
I too like to walk
before breakfast.

688
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,416
But I wouldn't have
gone out alone.

689
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,920
I feel perfectly safe when
I'm alone. Thank you.

690
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,588
I share your feeling.

691
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:15,341
But didn't you know you that
Rogers was outside?

692
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,511
Poor man.
I hope he didn't catch cold.

693
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,849
What's that?

694
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,517
- Someone's knocking.
- Kitchen door.

695
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,352
Rogers, of course.
He wants to get in.

696
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:28,271
That's it. We forgot
all about breakfast.

697
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:39,740
- Where is he?
- Somebody was knocking.

698
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:44,537
Rogers!

699
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,718
Rogers!

700
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:02,471
- He's not there.
- Rogers!

701
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:06,809
Know what I think?
We got our man. it's Rogers!

702
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:08,978
It fits the
psychological pattern.

703
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:12,231
His behavior last night
was distinctly abnormal.

704
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:15,193
Psychological pattern, my eye.
I go by facts.

705
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,737
He was officially accused,
Fact!

706
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,238
He got drunk.

707
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,657
He wouldn't open the door
to the woodshed. Fact!

708
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,242
Realizing this morning,

709
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:25,828
that he'd gone to the end
of his rope. He disappears.

710
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:27,330
Fact!

711
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,874
There's another fact you
haven't mentioned about Rogers.

712
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,543
He's dead.

713
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,260
The murderer was fastidious.

714
00:53:41,344 --> 00:53:43,763
He cleaned this blade
after striking down his victim.

715
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,682
Obviously he crept up behind,
swung this chopper

716
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,518
and brought it down,
splitting the cranium.

717
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,608
Seven little Indian boys
chopping up sticks.

718
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:59,612
One chopped himself in half
and then there were six.

719
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,532
Would it have needed much
strength to strike the blow?

720
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,452
Well, a woman
could have done it.

721
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:08,371
If that's what you mean.

722
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,291
Miss Claythorne was locked
in her room, Doctor,

723
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,710
if that's what you mean.

724
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:17,213
We were all in our rooms.

725
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,299
Except

726
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:25,304
- No breakfast yet?
- No.

727
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:29,225
If I had a butler like Rogers.
I'd soon get rid of him.

728
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,480
Wait! We we've
forgotten something.

729
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,232
- What?
- The dining room!

730
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,237
It's still locked.
Where's the key?

731
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,073
We found it in Rogers's pocket.

732
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:54,000
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six.

733
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,919
- Another one missing?
- But the door was locked.

734
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,673
I get it!

735
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,679
No I don't.

736
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,603
Did you ever hear of a
bee sting being fatal?

737
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,355
No, Why?

738
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,025
Six little Indian boys
playing with a hive.

739
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,903
A bumblebee stung one
and then there were five.

740
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,870
Very stupid to kill the
only servant in the house.

741
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:33,289
Now we don't even know
where to find the marmalade.

742
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,833
Watch out for a bee.

743
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,631
I'd be careful with
that young man.

744
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:46,385
I mean to, Miss Brent.
I'm careful of everyone.

745
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,221
A clear conscience
is the best armor.

746
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,307
This island is in
the image of life.

747
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,602
The innocent has to be
surrounded by criminals.

748
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,313
That sounds like
Mr. Owen talking.

749
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:00,316
I see nothing wrong with his
idea of punishing the guilty.

750
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:07,073
What about his
accusations against you?

751
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,658
I wonder if these
eggs are fresh.

752
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:11,243
What about it, Miss Brent.

753
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:14,038
Your young nephew, aren't
you to blame for his death?

754
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,998
Family gossip, Miss Claythorne.

755
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:18,000
My sister's boy had bad blood.

756
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,668
From the father's side,
of course.

757
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,420
But he was no good, naturally.

758
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:23,881
I had to have him
placed in a reformatory.

759
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,592
I do hope these
eggs aren't overcooked.

760
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,388
What happened to the boy?

761
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,014
Oh, I never saw him again.

762
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,600
He added to his many sins
by hanging himself.

763
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:42,858
I got it! I know who
took the last Indian.

764
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:45,528
- Who?
- Rogers.

765
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,825
He had the key to
this room. Fact.

766
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,536
He sneaks in and
takes a little Indian.

767
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,163
Locks the door again.

768
00:56:56,247 --> 00:57:00,709
Goes back to the woodshed where
he chops some sticks. Fact.

769
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:04,296
- And then
- And then

770
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,298
He takes the chopper and
splits his own cranium,

771
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,467
as the Doctor would say. Fact.

772
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,636
I'd like to see you do
that to yourself, Blore.

773
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,555
It would take practice.

774
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:19,645
Anyone inside the house could
leave without being noticed.

775
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:23,065
- True, Miss Brent?
- Perfectly true.

776
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:26,652
The murderer meets Rogers
outside and kills him.

777
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,822
He then takes the key
from his victim's pocket,

778
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:31,991
and you know the rest.

779
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:37,329
Yes, but the key was still
in Rogers' pocket!

780
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,165
Of course.

781
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,834
The murderer puts the
key back in Rogers' pocket

782
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,669
and goes to bed again.

783
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:47,882
Or goes for an innocent
walk before breakfast.

784
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,468
Sorry, Miss Brent.

785
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:54,972
Anyone have more tea?

786
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:01,228
Lombard!

787
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,448
- Lombard!
- Yes, Blore?

788
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:25,294
- What you doing here?
- You called me, didn't you?

789
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,172
Yes. Oh, yes, yes.

790
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:29,965
I ain't saying,

791
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:32,301
but don't you think the
old judge knows too much?

792
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,136
Describing every move

793
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,222
You'd think he had been
at the scene of the crime.

794
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,974
My dear Blore, in my opinion
you haven't a chance.

795
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:41,977
- Why is that?
- Lack of imagination.

796
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,063
A criminal with a
brain like U N Owen

797
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,398
can think rings around you,
anytime he wants to.

798
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,485
No man ever got the
better of me yet.

799
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,903
How about a woman?

800
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,741
Yes, yes, one should
never trust a woman.

801
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,743
She's clearly a
manic-depressive.

802
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,828
I don't know why I
didn't see it before.

803
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:02,414
She was very strange in
the kitchen this morning.

804
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,166
We all behaved strangely,

805
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,087
but I find no evidence.
She left no clue.

806
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,588
But she did.

807
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,679
What about this, eh?

808
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,890
No sane person would
think about using seaweed

809
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:21,600
as a pattern for a shawl.

810
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,435
She tried to throw
us off the track.

811
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,438
It's her!
<i>I'll</i> stake my life, it's her.

812
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,524
Wait, Blore.

813
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,568
Let Miss Claythorne call her.

814
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,903
She'll be less suspicious.

815
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,786
Miss Brent!

816
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,583
Miss Brent!

817
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:25,789
Miss Brent! Miss Brent!

818
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:29,418
It's no use, Miss Claythorne.
She'll not answer.

819
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,592
Look at the bee!
Look at the bee!

820
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,513
Just an ordinary bee,
Miss Claythorne.

821
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:46,352
Nothing, but a small
mark on the neck.

822
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,604
Here's your bee, Doctor.

823
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:05,621
Somebody must have taken it.
It's not here. See for yourself.

824
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:08,874
- What poison was injected?
- I can only guess.

825
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:13,712
It was very potent.
She must have died immediately.

826
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:18,342
But the bee.
That bee in her room.

827
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,969
That's our murderer's
artistic touch

828
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:24,014
He likes to stick to his
blasted nursery jingle.

829
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,891
He's mad. We're all mad.

830
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:30,521
I'm not, Mr. Lombard. I still
have my reasoning powers.

831
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:36,151
There are five of us left.
One of us is a murderer.

832
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:39,571
- The rest of us are defenseless.
- Defenseless?

833
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,658
How do we know one of us
hasn't have a revolver?

834
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,244
A good point, Blore!
How do we know?

835
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:49,415
Well, I know I haven't got one.
Dear me, it's against the law.

836
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,500
How about you, Doctor?

837
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:54,169
Of course not. You may search
me, gentlemen, search me.

838
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,672
- Miss Claythorne?
- I wish I had.

839
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:59,800
Quite right, Miss Claythorne,
it's an unfortunate oversight.

840
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,260
One should never
be careless, when

841
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:02,845
visiting a place
one doesn't know.

842
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,848
Why didn't you tell us that
you had a revolver?

843
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:07,433
Nobody asked me.

844
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:10,018
I've got him!
Search his pockets.

845
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,688
Aren't you wasting your time?

846
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,023
I know where it is.

847
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,696
Judge, you said just now that
one of us was the murderer.

848
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,782
If I were you, I wouldn't
let Blore get at that gun.

849
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:32,040
It's not here!

850
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:34,042
Look again, Blore.
It's got to be there.

851
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,795
Look in his pockets!

852
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,547
Don't. Get him off. Get him off.

853
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,965
It's not here.

854
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,760
- What did you do with it?
- What did you do with it?

855
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,887
Good heavens, where is it?

856
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,805
The one who can answer
that question,

857
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:49,224
is obviously not going to speak.

858
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,919
At a time like this.

859
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:21,173
A game of the mind, Blore,
a game of the mind.

860
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,844
You know the safest
thing for you to do

861
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,013
is stay in your room,
with the door locked.

862
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,598
What about yourself?

863
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,100
Oh, I wouldn't stay out here
alone with any of the others.

864
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,936
Why not?

865
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:36,605
Don't you think it strange
that there's never

866
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,192
a third person present when
anything unpleasant occurs?

867
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:44,363
Mr. Owen always manages
to be alone with his victim.

868
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:48,867
When a third person is
present, nothing happens.

869
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:54,206
Doesn't that make you nervous,
out here with me, alone?

870
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,208
But, we're not alone.

871
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:01,380
I asked Mr. Blore to keep an
eye on us. He's my third person.

872
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,386
Blore!

873
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,644
Look, another misfortune.

874
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,730
Something wrong
with the machinery.

875
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,316
Batteries must be running down.

876
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,903
We've got to keep every light
in the house burning tonight.

877
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:27,406
<i>I'll</i> go to the woodshed
and see to it.

878
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,661
Leave it on, Doctor,
leave it on.

879
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:38,667
Put you off your game,
wouldn't it, this flickering?

880
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,421
You went away from the
window and left me alone.

881
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,839
I've got to go to the woodshed.
You better go

882
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,591
to your room and lock your door.

883
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:47,009
I shall.

884
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:09,031
- Where's Miss Claythorne?
- I don't know.

885
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,867
- Where's Blore?
- Went out to the woodshed.

886
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,619
Woodshed?

887
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,129
What's wrong, Doctor?

888
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:31,470
Oh, I see. You and I, well,
we are alone in the house.

889
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,388
- Lombard!
- Lombard!

890
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:35,057
- Come here!
- Don't leave us!

891
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,156
- Where's Vera?
- Vera?

892
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:53,158
- Miss Claythorne! Answer me!
- Don't come any closer!

893
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:54,743
- Where is she?
- Keep back!

894
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,495
Blore, if I you don't tell me,
I swear <i>I'll</i> kill you.

895
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,914
If you make another move,
I'll brain you.

896
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:02,417
You know, Doctor, please
give me a chance.

897
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,671
If you are Mr. Owen,
friend tell me.

898
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,507
I I won't say a
word to the others.

899
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,592
Don't torment me this way.

900
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:15,222
If you want to kill the
others, I won't interfere.

901
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,099
I won't say a word.

902
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,768
I'll even help you if
you spare my life.

903
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:24,940
Look, I trust you.
Don't you trust me?

904
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,027
- Um yes.
- That's more reasonable.

905
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,779
Don't come any closer!

906
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:35,367
- Isn't your arm getting tired?
- Don't worry about me.

907
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:38,704
Listen, if Miss Claythorne is
safe in her room as you say,

908
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,122
we are both behaving
like idiots.

909
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,332
Can't get round me that way.
I prefer being a living idiot.

910
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,793
- Hang on, someone's coming.
- What?

911
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:50,215
Miss Claythorne! I told you
to stay locked in your room.

912
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:54,302
I'm looking for oh.

913
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,805
He's right, Vera.
You shouldn't be so careless!

914
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,807
- Come on!
- Stay here, both of you.

915
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,143
Now I can do what
I came out to do.

916
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,563
Do not know anything
about electricity?

917
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,149
Don't bother me. I get it!

918
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,819
- Stay where you are!
- I shan't move an inch.

919
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,740
Neither will I
till the light comes on.

920
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:18,744
- Do you think it will?
- Why not?

921
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,330
This is no accident.

922
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:24,916
Someone wants this
house to be dark at night.

923
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,419
- Who?
- The one we fear.

924
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,422
My dear, Doctor,
we've made a mistake.

925
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:34,342
This trick of putting
out the lights,

926
01:07:34,426 --> 01:07:38,430
clears two people, you and me.

927
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,766
Now we can trust each other.

928
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:46,104
I see! The idea was keep
us in fear of each other.

929
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:49,274
But now we can form
an alliance, you and I.

930
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,694
And find the murderer.

931
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:57,032
We no longer have anything to
conceal from each other have we.

932
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,618
Just what I was thinking.

933
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:04,039
Oh ho, I needed that.

934
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:07,125
Now?

935
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,795
Now we can tell
each other the truth.

936
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,880
The entire truth.

937
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,811
Who's going to speak first?

938
01:08:28,897 --> 01:08:31,650
Very well, I shall begin.

939
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:37,239
As you know, Mr. Owen's
saying that I was responsible

940
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,158
for the death of one
Edward Seaton.

941
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,911
It's perfectly true.

942
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:46,915
He was an innocent man
on trial for his life.

943
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,000
I'd nothing against him.

944
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:53,839
I wanted to ruin the reputation
of his defending counsel,

945
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:59,928
who lost the case,
while his client lost his life.

946
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:05,016
Doctor? Tell us the truth.

947
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:09,354
Your fate depends on it.
I'm convinced of that.

948
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:18,113
The gramophone
record did not lie.

949
01:09:18,196 --> 01:09:22,534
I operated on Mrs. Cleese while
under the influence of uh...

950
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:28,707
Guilty, I was, but of
drinking not of killing.

951
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:36,798
I don't see where
this is getting us.

952
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:38,633
Sit down, Mr. Blore.

953
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:42,220
This is getting us to a
very important conclusion.

954
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:44,389
Isn't that right, Doctor?

955
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,058
If I were you,
I would speak, Mr. Blore.

956
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:53,231
- I didn't kill anybody!
- We're listening, Mr. Blore.

957
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:57,569
This Landor chap
was innocent all right,

958
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:00,322
but I was mixed up with the
gang that was out to get him.

959
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:03,575
On my testimony,
he got sent up for life.

960
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,160
That's all.

961
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:07,996
But he died in prison,
didn't he?

962
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:10,332
Course he did!

963
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,001
How could I know
that would happen?

964
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,086
What about yourself Mr. Lombard?

965
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:18,506
What about those 21 poor
natives in South Africa?

966
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,427
Don't get excited, Blore.

967
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:26,431
Mr. Lombard is unable
to deny a thing.

968
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,935
Ah ha! That's the first
thing you said I believe.

969
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:33,605
Are you leaving us,
Miss Claythorne?

970
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:38,526
My dear child, you're trembling.

971
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,529
I I'm so cold.

972
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:44,199
Would you like us to
postpone this inquiry,

973
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,784
while we build a fire?

974
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:52,040
That would mean going outside
to get wood, as Rogers did.

975
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,794
No. We wait while
you get your coat.

976
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:57,462
Thank you.

977
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,470
Stay here, Mr. Lombard.

978
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:08,807
Nothing can happen to her
if we all remain in this room.

979
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:25,573
Aah!

980
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,040
- Vera!
- Claythorne!

981
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:35,500
- Get a light!
- Haven't got one!

982
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,253
- Who is it?
- It's me, Blore!

983
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,587
- Guy Lombard!

984
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,506
- Where's Blore?
- How do I know in the dark.

985
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,925
Where have you
been all this time?

986
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,927
I went to my room
to get this candle.

987
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,512
Where have you been?

988
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,264
I've been looking
for my flashlight.

989
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,016
Where is Blore?

990
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:55,228
Blore! What the devil are
you doing in my room?

991
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:58,606
Your room? No wonder
I couldn't find anything.

992
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,859
- What happened to you?
- Somebody bumped into me.

993
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,610
- Did you hear anything?
- Yes, sounded like a shot.

994
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,195
Sounded like
something fell to me.

995
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,448
You're jumpy,
both of you. Nerves.

996
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,200
It's Vera's.

997
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:15,290
Vera!

998
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,211
Vera! What happened?

999
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,130
Don't be frightened, Vera.
What happened?

1000
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:24,883
- He was in my room.
- Who?

1001
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,720
I felt. Oh, I don't know

1002
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,638
- Something like a hand.
- Who was it?

1003
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:34,142
I don't know.
My candles went out.

1004
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:36,227
We'll soon find out.

1005
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:49,157
Help! Lights! Lights!

1006
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:52,911
Seaweed.

1007
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,539
It felt like a cold hand.

1008
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,000
That's what Miss Claythorne
walked into.

1009
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:01,086
Who brought it in here?

1010
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,963
Who brought it into the house?

1011
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:09,177
- Miss Brent.
- Are you sure, Miss Brent is...

1012
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:28,530
- Dead as a doornail.
- Where's the judge?

1013
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,867
That's funny, I thought
he came up with us.

1014
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,285
So did I.

1015
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:35,954
He was right behind
me on the staircase.

1016
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:40,625
Yes, I thought I bumped into
him when I heard that shot.

1017
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,044
- Shot? What did I tell you?
- What?

1018
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:44,712
Why, the old bloke
knew too much.

1019
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,297
- You say you heard a shot?
- Yes.

1020
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:48,883
Well, don't you see? He took
a shot at us in the dark.

1021
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:51,136
He'll pot us like clay pigeons,
when we go downstairs.

1022
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:53,221
There's one way to find out!

1023
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:05,567
It's my own.

1024
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,486
No. It looks too easy.

1025
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,244
Alright, Judge, come outside.

1026
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,247
Don't think I can't see you.

1027
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:33,428
He has been shot
through the head.

1028
01:14:36,598 --> 01:14:38,516
Only one shot fired.

1029
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:48,610
Who will be next?

1030
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:55,283
Another one proved innocent.
Too late.

1031
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:58,286
He'd found the solution. That's
why he had to be silenced.

1032
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:02,957
- Silenced by who?
- By whom? Don't you remember?

1033
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:12,550
One moment, Miss Claythorne!

1034
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:18,723
Just when the judge was
about to question you

1035
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,476
you came up here,
presumably to get your coat.

1036
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,144
True?

1037
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:26,231
Yes.

1038
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:28,233
You opened that door.

1039
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:30,944
Wind blows out your candles,
seaweed touches your face...

1040
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:32,946
You scream. Perfect, perfect.

1041
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:35,240
But, considerable time elapses,

1042
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,908
and then we find
you way down there.

1043
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,660
What made you run the wrong way?

1044
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:41,162
She didn't know where she
was going. She was hysterical.

1045
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:42,664
Agreed.

1046
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,666
But if Miss Claythorne
had not screamed,

1047
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,584
we would still be
in the dining room,

1048
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:48,086
and the judge would be alive.

1049
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,172
Now wait a minute.
Don't confuse things.

1050
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:52,840
One of you two
pulled this trigger

1051
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:54,175
and you're trying to pin
it on Miss Claythorne.

1052
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:55,760
Now you wait a minute,
Mr. Lombard.

1053
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,428
We know very well that the judge

1054
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:59,097
was on the point of an
important discovery.

1055
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,848
How do we know what was
in the judge's mind?

1056
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,101
I do know.
He took me into his confidence.

1057
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:06,521
Truth. The entire truth.

1058
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,900
Miss Claythorne,
did you or did you not,

1059
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:13,611
commit the crime, of which the
gramophone accused you?

1060
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,697
I'd rather not talk about it.

1061
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:20,535
Ah, but you must. We've all
confessed our little errors.

1062
01:16:20,952 --> 01:16:23,830
All except you.
Come now, my girl.

1063
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:27,584
You didn't really kill this
Barclay chap did you?

1064
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:30,712
Will you take my word,
if I tell you I didn't?

1065
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,547
I'm afraid, I will.

1066
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,799
Then you have my word for it.

1067
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:38,219
And don't ask me
any more questions.

1068
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:42,974
Can't you see
she's telling the truth?

1069
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,143
That is precisely her mistake.

1070
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,895
- I don't see why.
- You will. You will.

1071
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:49,731
The judge reasoned it out.

1072
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,151
Owen enticed us to this island

1073
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:55,028
to be punished for
our past crimes.

1074
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,487
Right.

1075
01:16:56,571 --> 01:17:01,409
We three have admitted,
shall I say, our guilt.

1076
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:02,827
Right.

1077
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,495
Therefore, we cannot
be interested in

1078
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:06,998
- the punishment of crime.
- Right.

1079
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,876
Conclusion: Owen is the one

1080
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:12,253
who has not committed
any past crimes.

1081
01:17:12,337 --> 01:17:15,590
I get it!
What a wonderful brain.

1082
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,343
To think he couldn't
save his own life.

1083
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:19,761
Yes, but he saved ours.

1084
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:21,846
Yes of course,
that's the important thing.

1085
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,100
Do you understand now,
Mr. Lombard?

1086
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:29,270
Oh, it's great. Convincing.
Mathematical deduction.

1087
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,524
Oh, wait a minute.

1088
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:35,777
- Oh, no!
- Not you either, Blore.

1089
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:39,989
Now nobody has it.

1090
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:41,616
That's an excellent arrangement.

1091
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,619
- Now we can all sleep.
- Let's turn in, gentlemen.

1092
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,379
Good night, gentlemen.

1093
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:57,382
Doctor, I find one
flaw in your theory.

1094
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,717
I could destroy
it in four words.

1095
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:01,552
Do you want to hear them?

1096
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:05,807
Suppose I said: I am Mr. Owen.

1097
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:12,271
It would be most interesting.
But quite unlikely.

1098
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:16,651
Trouble with you, Lombard,
is nobody could believe you.

1099
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,112
Too bad.
I was just trying to be helpful.

1100
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,822
Good night. Sleep well.

1101
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,740
<i>L</i> hope <i>I</i> will.

1102
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:25,326
I'm sure I will.

1103
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,106
How long have you
been out there?

1104
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:38,983
Shh. Not so loud.

1105
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,110
But how long have
you been out there?

1106
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:43,154
Ever since you
put out your light.

1107
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:44,655
Why?

1108
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,912
I wanted to be here to
welcome Mr. Owen.

1109
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:54,081
Locking you in this room and
leaving the key outside

1110
01:19:54,165 --> 01:19:55,583
is a little too obvious,
isn't it?

1111
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,752
It's the doctor or Blore.

1112
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,712
And unless I am mistaken,

1113
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:01,923
one of them is going to come
through that door at any minute.

1114
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:05,843
How do I know he's
not here already? You.

1115
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:08,679
If you believe that you wouldn't
have opened your window.

1116
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:12,141
- What about me?
- <i>Hmm.</i> You're not smart enough.

1117
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:15,019
A quick thinking girl would have
confessed to any old crime,

1118
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:17,855
in order to clear herself of
what's happened in this house.

1119
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:23,778
Are you sure, you didn't
kill this fellow, Barclay?

1120
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:28,282
Maybe you forgot about it.

1121
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:33,120
Or maybe he never existed.

1122
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:38,251
- Yes, he did.
- Or maybe, he was never killed.

1123
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:42,463
Yes, he was.

1124
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:50,054
By someone who was close to you?
And you were suspected?

1125
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:55,059
What happened to that someone,
who was close to you.?

1126
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,979
She was my sister.

1127
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:02,358
I took care of her
to the very last.

1128
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,572
Oh, now I see that Mr. Owen
isn't infallible.

1129
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,407
You don't belong in this house.

1130
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,908
You haven't killed
your way into it.

1131
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,326
Aren't you ashamed

1132
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,662
of taking this ever so lightly,
Mr. Lombard?

1133
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,915
Don't call me Mister.
And don't call me Lombard.

1134
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:20,001
I'll tell you something
about Mr. Lombard.

1135
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,086
Something else that Mr. Owen
doesn't know

1136
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,504
Listen!

1137
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:31,429
Give me a chance to grab him
when he comes in.

1138
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,681
Don't shoot unless you have to.

1139
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,363
- He's going away.
- Down the stairs.

1140
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,198
I'm going to find out.

1141
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:55,953
I forgot. it's locked.

1142
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,957
- I'll go around the other way.
- Take the gun.

1143
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,542
Oh you keep it,
in case I can't get back.

1144
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:02,960
But he might kill you.

1145
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:05,212
If he does, he's going to
make a serious mistake.

1146
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:09,133
The other thing he doesn't
know is I am not Mr. Lombard.

1147
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:49,006
Now, we'll find out.
It's either Blore or the doctor.

1148
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,675
The one, who's not in his room.

1149
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,804
Blore!

1150
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,682
Blore! Get up. Open the door.

1151
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,187
Who let that girl
out of her room?

1152
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,856
Never mind about her.
Come on, Blore!

1153
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,778
He's not here.
Now we know who it is.

1154
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:13,280
I heard him go downstairs.
Come on, Blore. We'll catch him!

1155
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:17,535
How do I know you
heard the doctor?

1156
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,120
Don't be a fool, Blore.

1157
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,123
- We've no time to waste.
- Ah, life is short, isn't it?

1158
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:25,292
- But I heard him too Mr. Blore.
- Oh, you did, did you?

1159
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,546
That's a nice present,
you've got there.

1160
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,381
Mr. Lombard's getting generous.

1161
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:33,384
- You go first!
- Come on, Vera!

1162
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:50,067
Might be a trick.

1163
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:52,319
Right, Blore.
Maybe, he's in the house.

1164
01:23:59,577 --> 01:24:02,747
One. Two. Three.
Three Indians only.

1165
01:24:03,289 --> 01:24:06,125
He wants to make
us think, he's dead.

1166
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,586
That's to throw
us off the track.

1167
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:12,423
You don't fool us this time,
Dr. Armstrong!

1168
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,928
Who's there?

1169
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,339
Lombard!

1170
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,096
Blore. What are you doing
down there alone?

1171
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,806
I think I know where
the doctor is.

1172
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,224
Where?

1173
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:04,809
I'm not sure yet.
I'll wait for you.

1174
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:07,061
Alright. We shan't be long.

1175
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,447
I get it!

1176
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,184
Aren't you being careless,
unlocking your door

1177
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,685
when you don't know
who's out here?

1178
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,228
But I thought it was you.

1179
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:34,565
- You heard it too, eh?
- I heard you pass my door.

1180
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:38,569
Not me. I thought I heard you.

1181
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:41,322
Are you sure you haven't
been outside of your room?

1182
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:44,575
I wanted to ask
you the same thing.

1183
01:26:46,035 --> 01:26:48,579
Maybe, Mr. Blore came
back to his room.

1184
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,247
No, no-no.
I knocked on his door.

1185
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:51,874
I heard a noise
while I was dressing.

1186
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,126
- Like a door slamming?
- Exactly.

1187
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:55,836
You heard it too, huh?

1188
01:26:58,214 --> 01:27:00,925
- What is it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1189
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:03,844
I feel all the time that
there's someone

1190
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:06,430
someone waiting and watching?

1191
01:27:06,513 --> 01:27:07,848
Yes, I know what you mean.

1192
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:10,226
- Oh, it's just nerves.
- Then you have felt it.

1193
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,977
Keep a grip on
yourself, darling.

1194
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:13,771
There's nothing supernatural
about this business.

1195
01:27:13,854 --> 01:27:15,272
It's definitely human.

1196
01:27:15,356 --> 01:27:17,191
- You mean, it's the doctor?
- The mad doctor.

1197
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,526
- Hiding here?
- We'll soon find out.

1198
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,530
Aaah!

1199
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,970
He must have been
looking that way.

1200
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:50,140
And while he was looking,
Dr. Armstrong

1201
01:27:51,392 --> 01:27:53,185
That was Armstrong
we both heard.

1202
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:55,229
But what was Blore looking at?

1203
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,652
What do you see?
What is it?

1204
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:05,656
- It's impossible!
- Let me see!

1205
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:11,662
You're going to see.
Come with me.

1206
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:17,668
What is it? What is it? Tell me.

1207
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,491
Look!

1208
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:56,540
Armstrong.
He's been dead for hours.

1209
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:00,377
- For hours?
- Since the last tide.

1210
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:03,047
No footprints around the body.

1211
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:12,514
But if he was
Who killed Blore?

1212
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:15,976
Yes, there are only two people
alive on this island.

1213
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:17,978
- You.
- And you.

1214
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:21,065
So this is how it ends, Vera.

1215
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:25,235
This is how it ends.
We come to the truth now.

1216
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,988
Yes, the truth.
The entire truth.

1217
01:29:28,072 --> 01:29:29,740
Don't come any closer!

1218
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:34,578
Oh, I see.
That's not quite right, my dear.

1219
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,580
It doesn't fit in your
nursery rhyme.

1220
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:38,749
Don't try to talk your way out.

1221
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:42,836
You made one mistake,
giving me this revolver.

1222
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,755
Look, I don't mind being killed.

1223
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,424
But I hate like the devil to
be killed for someone else.

1224
01:29:47,508 --> 01:29:49,343
Didn't I tell you I
wasn't Lombard?

1225
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:51,345
- What is your name?
- Charles Morley.

1226
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,013
You're not a very
good detective.

1227
01:29:53,097 --> 01:29:54,640
Mr. Blore spotted the
initials on my luggage,

1228
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,100
the moment I arrived here.

1229
01:29:56,183 --> 01:29:57,601
Why did you come here
under another name?

1230
01:29:57,684 --> 01:30:00,020
I knew Lombard very well.
He committed suicide.

1231
01:30:00,104 --> 01:30:02,189
I wanted to find out
if Mr. Owen's letter

1232
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:03,607
had anything to do with it.

1233
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,109
Do you expect me
to believe that?

1234
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:06,443
Why not?

1235
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:08,195
There's something much more
difficult to believe.

1236
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:09,863
That one of us is Mr. Owen.

1237
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:12,783
I know I'm not, and I simply
can't believe that you are.

1238
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,702
Don't try to fool me.
I know I'm not.

1239
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:20,290
It's got to be you.
There's no other explanation.

1240
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:23,043
If you're so sure, go
ahead and shoot me.

1241
01:30:23,419 --> 01:30:25,045
You see? You have a doubt.

1242
01:30:25,129 --> 01:30:27,464
Don't come any closer.
I'll shoot.

1243
01:30:27,548 --> 01:30:29,049
No you won't. You can't shoot.

1244
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:30,801
You still trust me,
and I still trust you.

1245
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:33,387
There's got to
be an explanation.

1246
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:39,643
Yes, that's it!
You've got to shoot me!

1247
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:42,312
- Now shoot!
- But it won't hit you.

1248
01:30:42,396 --> 01:30:45,315
That's what I mean! Shoot, and
don't be frightened if I fall.

1249
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,730
A game of the mind,
Miss Claythorne.

1250
01:32:06,813 --> 01:32:09,316
You came just in time
for my last shot.

1251
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:11,902
And now the game is over.

1252
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:18,492
One little Indian
boy left all alone.

1253
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,577
He went and hanged himself.

1254
01:32:20,661 --> 01:32:22,162
And then there were none.

1255
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:24,081
That's for you, Miss Claythorne.

1256
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:27,084
What if I don't agree
to hang myself?

1257
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:29,920
Oh, that's been taken care of.

1258
01:32:31,255 --> 01:32:33,423
Do you mind if I sit down?

1259
01:32:33,507 --> 01:32:36,176
Every artist has a certain
amount of vanity.

1260
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:39,429
We all like the
approbation of the public.

1261
01:32:39,513 --> 01:32:41,515
And you are my last public.

1262
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:44,184
I had two great ideas.

1263
01:32:44,268 --> 01:32:48,105
The first was a search for
perfect human justice.

1264
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:52,359
And you've seen the result.

1265
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:57,114
To perfect this scheme,
my second idea

1266
01:32:57,197 --> 01:32:59,366
was to find an
unwitting accomplice

1267
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:02,452
among the criminals
invited here for punishment.

1268
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:05,622
I needed a respectable fool.

1269
01:33:05,706 --> 01:33:08,125
And naturally I selected

1270
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,211
a man whose fear of death

1271
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:13,880
might make him
extremely cooperative.

1272
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:16,466
I proposed a scheme to confuse

1273
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:18,468
the imaginary Mr. Owen.

1274
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,470
It was simply this:

1275
01:33:20,554 --> 01:33:23,015
I must appear to
be the next victim.

1276
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,975
Remember the seaweed?

1277
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:27,477
Armstrong and I
placed it in your room.

1278
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:29,980
Your scream was perfect.

1279
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:35,694
We pretended to rush out, but
according to our plan,

1280
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:37,404
we came back.

1281
01:33:37,571 --> 01:33:41,325
Now, I was assumed to be dead.

1282
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:46,580
Killed by that gun,
I had borrowed from Mr. Lombard.

1283
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:49,833
And which he found
later on the steps.

1284
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:54,087
I counted on everyone's
confusion in the dark.

1285
01:33:54,171 --> 01:33:58,925
And I counted on Armstrong
to play his part to the hilt.

1286
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:13,106
I knew no one would challenge
the doctor's authority.

1287
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:16,360
When he would say: He has
been shot through the head.

1288
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:20,030
After that, I had
to play my part.

1289
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:22,866
And what a part it was!

1290
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:26,953
No one would suspect me,
least of all the dear doctor,

1291
01:34:27,037 --> 01:34:31,792
who thought I was about to
discover the unknown murderer,

1292
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:34,127
and was waiting for
me on the beach.

1293
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:36,797
And worrying about
the success of our plan.

1294
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,801
A few minutes later, he had
nothing more to worry about.

1295
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,888
Justice had triumphed
once again.

1296
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,557
Too late, he had
learned that drinking,

1297
01:34:47,641 --> 01:34:51,728
when it gets out of hand,
can be fatal.

1298
01:34:51,895 --> 01:34:56,983
So you see, the whole thing
has been as inevitable

1299
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:58,819
as the nursery rhyme.

1300
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:01,488
When the boat arrives
from the mainland,

1301
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:03,990
there will be ten dead
bodies and a riddle,

1302
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:06,326
no one can solve
on Indian Island.

1303
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:07,994
Ten?

1304
01:35:08,078 --> 01:35:11,415
My dear child,
I'm an old and sick man.

1305
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:14,251
I received my death
sentence a year ago.

1306
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:18,088
Rather than go
painfully and slowly

1307
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:21,591
I choose to leave
this wicked world

1308
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:24,428
with a proud record
of good deeds.

1309
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:29,015
But how can you force me
to hang myself?

1310
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:31,852
The only living
person found here

1311
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:34,771
with nine corpses,
will certainly be hanged.

1312
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:37,274
As the last little Indian,
has to be.

1313
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:42,946
Public hanging isn't pretty.

1314
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:46,616
If you'll allow me to give
you a piece of friendly advice,

1315
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,119
do it now, privately.

1316
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,580
It's more dignified.

1317
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,546
And now my work is done.

1318
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:10,015
Never should trust a woman.

1319
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:14,644
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Owen.

1320
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:16,813
But if I hadn't
trusted you, darling,

1321
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:18,231
and you hadn't trusted me...

1322
01:36:18,315 --> 01:36:20,066
By the way,
why did you trust me?

1323
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,735
Why did you?

1324
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:25,280
On account of one thing,
Mr. Owen couldn't foresee.

1325
01:36:25,781 --> 01:36:29,659
Aaah! Somebody!
Somebody's still alive!

1326
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,500
Good morning.

1327
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:40,921
- Ready to leave now?
- Ho, ho, are we!

1328
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:43,089
Are the others ready too?

1329
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,926
You call them.
