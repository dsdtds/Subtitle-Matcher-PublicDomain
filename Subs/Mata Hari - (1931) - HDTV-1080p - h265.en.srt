1
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:35,742
Right.

2
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:38,678
Look. Is any woman worth that?

3
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:41,753
Surely, you regret having betrayed
your country.

4
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:45,018
- You can still have a chance—
- You're wasting time.

5
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:47,427
Come on, out with it.

6
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:51,157
Who is she? What is her name?

7
00:01:51,802 --> 00:01:54,499
Tell us, you fool!

8
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,502
Mata Hari.

9
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:59,206
That's her name, isn't it?

10
00:01:59,676 --> 00:02:02,669
- Let me alone.
- Oh, shoot him.

11
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,483
She bewitches them.

12
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:10,517
Why not? She bewitched all Paris.

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,086
She's France's greatest enemy.

14
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,417
The woman has become
a mania with you, Dubois.

15
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,125
After all, you're the only one
in Paris that believes she's a spy.

16
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:24,463
It's very dangerous to accuse a woman
who's so powerfully protected...

17
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:27,297
- ... without proof.
- I'll get that proof.

18
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:31,339
And one cold morning, you'll see your fine
Mata Hari tied to one of those posts.

19
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,081
- Dine with me tonight?
- Thanks, no.

20
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,482
- Tonight I'm to see your Mata Hari dance.
- What?

21
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:47,384
A special soiree at LeMarchand's.

22
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:49,992
- How dare you.
- It's to be smart and very private.

23
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:52,059
After all, there is a war going on.

24
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:55,396
Oh, well, some dance and some die.

25
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,933
And some will do both.

26
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:14,745
- Is that it?
- I think it is, General Shubin.

27
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,477
- May I?
- Surely.

28
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,690
It is. Amazing.

29
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:28,088
Something of an event to see
a ship arrive from Russia.

30
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:31,757
Event? Why, it's the first time in history,
a flight over the German lines.

31
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,919
Congratulations. A great achievement.

32
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,289
Thank you, sir,
but it's just sheer luck.

33
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,690
- And a good engine.
- The dispatches?

34
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,959
Quite safe, sir. I'm to deliver them
to the ambassador personally.

35
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:05,965
Yes, of course. Of course. Major.

36
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,698
May I present Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff
of the Russian imperial air force.

37
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,809
Proud to meet such a brave young man.

38
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:17,674
Thank you, sir. But I was frightened
to death all the way.

39
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:23,877
You'll hold yourself in readiness
for a return flight to Russia...

40
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,647
- ... as soon as our reply is ready.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

41
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:30,190
- How long will it take to decode this?
- Ten to 12 hours, Your Excellency.

42
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:31,691
Rush it, please.

43
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,897
General Shubin, please report
back here tonight at 11:30.

44
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:37,363
This will call for immediate counsel.

45
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:41,067
Congratulations, lieutenant.
We shan't forget.

46
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,604
General Shubin will give you
your instructions.

47
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:54,150
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

48
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,582
Well, you feel like celebrating?

49
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,721
Sleep is the only thing
I'm interested in.

50
00:04:58,922 --> 00:05:00,356
Can I put you up for the night?

51
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,924
No, thank you.
I still have my little place at Passy.

52
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:06,153
That is, if I can stay awake
long enough to get there.

53
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:10,892
I'd ask you to dine with me, but I have
to go to a reception right afterwards.

54
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,396
Mata Hari's dancing.

55
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:15,100
Mata Hari?

56
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:21,139
I'd be delighted
to have dinner with you, sir.

57
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,438
- I'm not as tired as I was.
- No?

58
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,815
The prospect of a good dinner, perhaps.

59
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,809
Yes, I suppose that's it.

60
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:32,183
After all, it's rather absurd to go straight
to bed your first night back in Paris.

61
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,614
I think I do feel rather
like celebrating.

62
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:36,486
If you can stay awake.

63
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,855
- Funny, I'm not even sleepy anymore.
- No?

64
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,923
That's all right, Rosanoff.

65
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:44,499
There'll be such a crowd there,
one more won't matter.

66
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:46,493
What do you mean?

67
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:50,335
Why, didn't you say you wanted
to see Mata Hari dance?

68
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:36,983
Shiva...

69
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,157
I dance for you tonight as the bayadères
danced in the sacred temples of Java.

70
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,385
Bravo!

71
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,661
Bravo!

72
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:57,389
They say her mother was a sacred dancer,
her father a temple priest.

73
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,264
You know she married a Dutchman.
My dear, he used to beat her.

74
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,131
Really? I can't believe it.

75
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,308
She makes matrimony seem so dull.

76
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:06,771
I'd like to know her.

77
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,638
I feel that I do know her.

78
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:25,722
Madame Mata Hari, may a perfect stranger
offer her appreciation?

79
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,125
- Thank you.
- Your costume was exquisite.

80
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,562
And those earrings, are they Javanese?

81
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,495
No, they are from India.

82
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,170
They're so intriguing. May I?

83
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:38,230
Andriani wants to see you at the Pavilion
at once. It's very important.

84
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,807
- Glad you like them.
- Thank you.

85
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,577
Do you think—?
Could you introduce me?

86
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:49,412
My dear boy, one doesn't meet Mata Hari
on the spur of the moment like that.

87
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,086
Besides, I'm late now.

88
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:54,223
- Do you mind if I stay for a while?
- No, no. Not at all.

89
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,416
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

90
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,187
I thought you were different
from the rest.

91
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,617
Champagne, please.

92
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,666
Take this for me.
I know what you like.

93
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:08,201
I know all about men like you—

94
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:14,434
Permit me, mademoiselle.

95
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:18,808
- Oh, wasn't she marvelous?
- Wasn't that a wonderful dance, monsieur?

96
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:21,644
It wasn't a dance, it was a poem.

97
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,945
- Do you know her?
- Who doesn't?

98
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,985
I would give my right arm to meet her.

99
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:28,385
So would I.

100
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:32,362
- To Mata Hari the incomparable.
- Unsurpassed.

101
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,656
- Priestess of the dance.
- High priestess.

102
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:37,163
- Goddess. Goddess of beauty.
- Bravo.

103
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,097
The dancer is only as beautiful
as the mood of her dance.

104
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,363
- To Mata Hari.
- To Mata Hari.

105
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,544
Now, gentleman, I'm terribly tired.
You'll have to excuse me.

106
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:52,742
You've been very, very charming.
I thank you.

107
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,084
Good night, my lady.

108
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:57,982
Good night. Good night.

109
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,888
- Marvelous.
- Why, of course.

110
00:10:06,362 --> 00:10:09,491
Have you ever seen people's faces
when you dance?

111
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,564
Have you any idea of the effect
you have on them?

112
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:15,795
My mind is so far away when I dance.

113
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:18,299
I live in another age.

114
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,409
Centuries back...

115
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,012
when man and woman—

116
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,226
Brandy is bad for your heart.

117
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,293
I thought you'd given it up.

118
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:43,824
I give up a lot of things,
but I take them back.

119
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,996
To me, anything I like is irresistible.

120
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:51,872
I've always been that way.
Unfortunately, it's in my blood.

121
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,804
What people you Russians are.

122
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:57,909
What charming savages.

123
00:10:58,114 --> 00:10:59,844
Come in.

124
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:04,277
- The Marquis de Signac.
- Wait. We're going to the Pavilion.

125
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,853
- Pavilion?
- Yes.

126
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:09,616
I like gambling.

127
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:11,852
They laugh, it's gay there.

128
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,757
Gay? With Signac?

129
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,262
- Is that necessary?
- Why not?

130
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:20,163
He's very attractive, young.

131
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:24,535
Of course, he's not a general
of the Russian imperial army...

132
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:27,274
so important as you.

133
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:29,646
- A diplomat—
- Or a traitor.

134
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,878
I said it, traitor.

135
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:35,017
- Now, quiet, Serge.
- The time has come when I can't be quiet.

136
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:39,349
There's something growing here that's
going to make me shout out...

137
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,148
the whole truth one day.

138
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:43,586
You want to die so badly?

139
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:45,994
I'm dead now.

140
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:50,756
Just as surely as though there were
a bullet in my heart.

141
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,361
You killed me.

142
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,868
No. The brandy.

143
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:58,906
No, no, no. You.

144
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:00,799
Then why don't you give me up?

145
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,208
- I will.
- Well, do.

146
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:06,915
Come in.

147
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,581
- So you're going to the Pavilion?
- Yes.

148
00:12:09,786 --> 00:12:13,086
- Much gambling.
- Caron, are you coming with us?

149
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:15,949
Sorry, my dear,
but I have to be in court at 9.

150
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:17,770
- Most important case.
- Too bad, too bad.

151
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:20,930
- Shubin?
- Madame, I must be leaving.

152
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,463
I'm due at the embassy now.

153
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:28,304
Good night.

154
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,242
Good night, general.

155
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:37,579
- Tonight, late supper?
- No.

156
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,440
Tonight.

157
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:42,514
I thought it was all over.

158
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,215
Well, tomorrow, then.

159
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,720
I must help you to give me up.

160
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,553
Please, tomorrow.

161
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:55,060
Good night, General Shubin.

162
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,131
Good night.

163
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,162
Madame Mata Hari's car!

164
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,518
To the Pavilion.

165
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:39,936
To the Pavilion.

166
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,321
Eight.

167
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,121
Ten.

168
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:06,492
Four thousand francs.

169
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:11,901
Here you are, sir.

170
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:14,733
I have charted all gun emplacements
and air batteries.

171
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:17,292
Good. You were attached
to me as a cook?

172
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:18,234
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,147
- Technical expert, eh?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,444
- With the rank of captain.
- That's right, sir.

175
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,952
- You're a good soldier?
- I hope so.

176
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,056
- And a good German?
- Yes, sir.

177
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:31,556
Some months ago, I furnished you
with plans and specifications...

178
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:33,423
of a new weapon called the tank.

179
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:34,824
Oh, yes, yes.

180
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,987
You laughed at it,
said it was impractical.

181
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,361
That's my belief, sir.

182
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:42,767
Well, captain, those impractical tanks
went into action in the Somme yesterday...

183
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:47,137
costing your country 20 kilometers
of front and 18,000 casualties.

184
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:50,176
- Impossible.
- So you said before.

185
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:56,684
Here are a few more of your
mistaken conclusions.

186
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:59,280
Correct them.

187
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:23,178
- Send Mademoiselle Carlotta here.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,831
Well, I was able to deliver
your message, Andriani.

189
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:54,708
Mata Hari is here.

190
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,243
Thank you, Carlotta.
That's what I wanted to know.

191
00:15:57,446 --> 00:15:58,555
Any more orders?

192
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,566
No. No, just run along
and enjoy yourself.

193
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,544
All right. Good night.

194
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:11,820
Dear lady.

195
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:13,553
Oh, good evening.

196
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,061
Won't you have my seat?

197
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:18,756
It's lucky.
It will be so much nicer to watch you.

198
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:21,367
- Thank you.
- A thousand francs for the bank.

199
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,869
- Two thousand.
- Ten thousand.

200
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:26,065
- Ten thousand.
- Ten thousand.

201
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,275
Madame.

202
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,876
Are you playing?

203
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:30,774
Never against you.

204
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,609
Any more bets?

205
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:35,079
Leon. Monsieur Leon.

206
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:37,150
- Oui, madame.
- I want some chips for this.

207
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:39,754
I'm sorry, madame.
We do not accept jewelry.

208
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:42,388
Perhaps one of the players.

209
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:44,156
You take it, madame.

210
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,258
He paid 10,000 francs for it.

211
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:48,395
Who paid 10,000 francs?

212
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:51,366
Whoever he was, he paid 10,000 for it.

213
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,497
I'll sell it for 5.

214
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:55,797
He had very good taste.

215
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,299
- It's an unusual ring.
- May I buy it for you?

216
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,007
It's bought.

217
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:06,176
- Going?
- Wait. I may be back.

218
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:07,883
Thank you.

219
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,319
Still 4000 in the bank.

220
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:20,322
Well, you're looking magnificent tonight,
my dear.

221
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:23,198
Last time I seemed only beautiful to you.

222
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,925
You must have something very difficult
for me tonight.

223
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:30,334
No, it shouldn't be for you. Important
dispatches have arrived from Russia.

224
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:33,436
All right. I'm having supper
with Shubin tomorrow night.

225
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,806
Splendid. Splendid. Why not tonight?

226
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:38,545
He's at the embassy.

227
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:42,250
- A conference.
- Probably concerns these dispatches.

228
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:44,953
- Probably.
- Then tomorrow night won't do.

229
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:47,554
You must see Shubin
the minute he returns.

230
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:51,750
- I have arranged differently.
- Then change your arrangements.

231
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:55,130
I think you should handle Shubin yourself.

232
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,500
You get along beautifully.

233
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,835
- You're so alike.
- This is no time for any of your moods.

234
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,902
Something vital may be involved in this.

235
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,198
Something vital is involved in it.

236
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:08,510
- Good night, Andriani.
- Then I insist you see Shubin tonight.

237
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:11,180
A car will be waiting for you
when you leave here.

238
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:14,584
You also insisted on that submarine job.

239
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,050
You finally had to do it yourself,
as far as I remember.

240
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,189
How well you did it.

241
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:22,419
I intend to do a better job
in finding out

242
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:24,851
who informed the French
authorities about it.

243
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:28,097
Of course, there's Carlotta, she knew.

244
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:31,062
- And you knew.
- And so did you.

245
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,965
You don't trust me, do you?

246
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,202
Yes. Yes.

247
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:39,704
But you're capricious.
You're a little bit mad.

248
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,811
You might give me away just
for the excitement of the thing.

249
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:44,640
You might get me killed.

250
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,009
Unless I kill you first.

251
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:50,881
Hadn't you better wait
until after tomorrow night?

252
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,215
A car will be waiting for you tonight.

253
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:08,469
Madame.

254
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:12,107
I beg your pardon.
I saw you admire this ring...

255
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,903
and I thought perhaps
you would like to have it.

256
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,577
Why?

257
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:23,017
Well, as a token
of my admiration for you.

258
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,570
How charming.

259
00:19:42,204 --> 00:19:43,832
Beautiful.

260
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:51,746
Madame, the car you ordered is waiting.

261
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:55,643
I won't need it. This young man
has offered to take me home.

262
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,351
Good night, Andriani.

263
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:16,702
- No, no, no.
- Just for a little while.

264
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:19,999
- No, no further.
- Please, don't say that.

265
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:24,176
I think you're very absurd,
very persistent and—

266
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,215
- Very nice? Thank you.
- And very Russian.

267
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:30,581
Now, go home.

268
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:33,988
I'm afraid of losing what I've found.

269
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:35,991
Meaning?

270
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,887
You.

271
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:52,106
Hadn't you better take that off?

272
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:54,809
As long as you insist upon staying.

273
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,441
For a little while.

274
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,415
How long have you been in Paris?

275
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,317
I flew from London this morning.

276
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,759
I saw you once in the Bois.

277
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,860
You were so lovely.

278
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:25,937
I watched you till you drove out
of sight among the chestnut blossoms.

279
00:21:26,475 --> 00:21:28,637
Oh, Paris in the spring.

280
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:30,545
Spring.

281
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:32,144
And now I'm here.

282
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:35,249
- With you.
- But it's autumn.

283
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,815
But perhaps next spring,
the war will be over...

284
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:41,983
- ... you and I—
- I never look ahead.

285
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,894
By next spring,
I shall probably be quite alone.

286
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:49,697
Never alone again.

287
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:53,996
I mean, at least my thoughts
will always be with you.

288
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,503
No, you mustn't.

289
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:05,175
But you are so beautiful.

290
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:36,943
This is absurd.

291
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,406
I am going to bed.

292
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,925
Don't speak.

293
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:58,967
Good night.

294
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:56,091
- Madame, the hairdresser can take you.
- I'm too nervous.

295
00:23:56,658 --> 00:24:00,220
- And the marquis is calling for you.
- I'm too tired, Marie.

296
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:04,126
- And Baron Michel telephoned.
- Oh, I'm not interested, really.

297
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,357
Mata.

298
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:07,399
Mata.

299
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:13,665
- But, no, sir.
- It's perfectly all right.

300
00:24:18,947 --> 00:24:21,507
For the loveliest lady in all France.

301
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,049
I had to see you.

302
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:29,815
It seemed like wasting life to sleep.

303
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:33,052
You're even more beautiful
than I remembered you.

304
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,463
- Why did you come here?
- I couldn't help it.

305
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:41,899
Out there, the birds were singing, and there
was a softness in the air just like spring.

306
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:46,302
And you were the song of the birds
and the warm brightness of the morning.

307
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:49,434
- It's very nice but—
- My heart was so full of you...

308
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:52,977
I had to come back and tell you
I love you and take you to lunch.

309
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:55,174
It's almost 2:00
and I have an appointment.

310
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:57,876
But you can break it.
I must take you to lunch.

311
00:24:58,187 --> 00:25:01,282
- I told you I have an appointment.
- And I told you to break it.

312
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,821
You're a fool.

313
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,929
The most conceited fool I've ever known.

314
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,798
Mata.

315
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:12,861
What makes you think you have
the right to burst in here?

316
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:16,170
I'm sorry. But last night
you told me that you loved me.

317
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,264
Oh, did I?

318
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:20,432
Well, that was last night.

319
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:22,674
Today I am very busy.

320
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,944
Marie.

321
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:28,948
- Yes, madame.
- The gentleman is leaving.

322
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:32,817
You are quite right.
I have been a fool.

323
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,884
I won't make this mistake again.

324
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,391
Still a peasant, Ivan, huh?

325
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,035
Still superstitious.

326
00:26:21,236 --> 00:26:24,035
Evil spirits come in on the wind.

327
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:29,334
There's Madame Mata Hari.

328
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:32,077
Leave that alone.
Hurry up, open the door.

329
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:34,474
Go on.

330
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:43,687
Monsieur Dubois.

331
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:45,592
Dubois?

332
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:49,557
What on earth can he want?

333
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,428
Tell him...
Tell him I can't see him.

334
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:57,135
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

335
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:00,138
Tell him...

336
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,743
that I shall be delighted.

337
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:05,004
My dear Dubois.

338
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:06,875
I'm afraid I'm intruding.

339
00:27:07,082 --> 00:27:09,916
And inwardly you must be saying,
"Confound this man Dubois."

340
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,644
- No. No, not at all, but—
- I'll be brief.

341
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:15,050
And if I seem to touch
on matters that are...

342
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:18,193
how shall I say it,
too intimate, you must forgive me...

343
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:20,419
- ... it is because of my duty.
- Yes?

344
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:23,028
You are very friendly with a lady...

345
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:25,894
perhaps the same one
that you are expecting tonight.

346
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:28,133
Well, what if I am?

347
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,465
We consider this woman
a very grave danger.

348
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:36,006
And as you know her better
than anyone else, we want you to help us.

349
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,175
Why, what are you talking about?

350
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:41,515
- I'm expecting Mata Hari.
- Exactly.

351
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:43,376
And Mata Hari is a spy.

352
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:46,578
- In the pay of the Wilhelmstrasse.
- A spy.

353
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:48,916
Oh, my dear Dubois.

354
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:51,491
- Now you insult my intelligence.
- Please.

355
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:54,162
Either that or you've lost your mind.

356
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:56,389
I'm quite sane, I assure you.

357
00:27:56,698 --> 00:27:59,065
Well, if she's a spy,
why don't you arrest her?

358
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:02,431
Because I need definite proof.
And that's why I am here.

359
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:05,968
This is an absolute joke.

360
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,239
It's really too good, you know.

361
00:28:10,545 --> 00:28:12,946
Mata Hari, a spy.

362
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:20,151
You know, for a moment,
I almost took you seriously.

363
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:24,122
Well, if the joke is as good as that,
I'd like to hear it.

364
00:28:24,326 --> 00:28:26,420
Or maybe it's too bad for me to hear.

365
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:29,962
No, no, no.
Our poor friend Dubois here...

366
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:32,691
says that you are a spy.

367
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:35,036
Well, of course I am.

368
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:37,565
Everyone is Paris knows that.

369
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,008
Even Dubois, who knows everything.

370
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:46,614
- Couldn't you guess, Shubin?
- No, I think I'm getting old and stupid.

371
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:48,407
As I've amused you both so much...

372
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:51,553
- ... perhaps I need not apologize.
- Please don't misunderstand—

373
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:53,813
I don't. Evidently, I'm mistaken.

374
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:55,217
Good night, madame.

375
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,451
I'm very sorry you found it necessary
to put me in this position.

376
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,923
I spoke in confidence.

377
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:01,490
- Good night.
- Good night.

378
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:05,497
Please don't misunderstand,
the whole thing was a joke.

379
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:38,422
Mother in heaven, I'm done for.

380
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,329
I'm finished.

381
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:41,969
What did he say?

382
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:45,833
He said that you were a spy
and that I was your—

383
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:48,033
- What else?
- Nothing else.

384
00:29:48,243 --> 00:29:50,644
I'm sure he suspects.

385
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,380
Well, he wouldn't come here
if he suspected you.

386
00:29:53,582 --> 00:29:55,676
It's me he's after. You're quite safe.

387
00:29:55,917 --> 00:30:01,083
But he must know something. Why should
he come here at 11:00 at night?

388
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:06,589
The chief of the spy bureau.
It's a trap, of course.

389
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:09,498
Don't be ridiculous.

390
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,299
Ridiculous?

391
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,301
Ridiculous.

392
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:16,094
Oh, what a fool I've been.

393
00:30:16,838 --> 00:30:18,067
Nothing mattered.

394
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:22,535
Honor, self-respect, everything gone.

395
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:24,242
Because of you.

396
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,312
You can't give away like this.

397
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,017
- Dubois knows nothing.
- He knows nothing.

398
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:33,013
Here I am facing dishonor,
perhaps death...

399
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:35,190
and it means nothing to you.

400
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,050
You haven't even
a word of pity for me.

401
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,358
You're all unstrung, Serge.

402
00:30:40,562 --> 00:30:42,258
Nothing's happened.

403
00:30:42,597 --> 00:30:44,463
Look at it calmly.

404
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,529
Laugh at it.

405
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:49,731
We'll laugh at it together.

406
00:30:53,975 --> 00:30:57,434
When you hold me like this,
nothing seems to matter.

407
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,074
Nothing in the world.

408
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,212
This must never leave your hands...

409
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:06,616
till you have delivered it personally
to the prime minister. That is vital.

410
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:09,721
Should you be forced down
in enemy territory...

411
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:13,692
pull this cord, and the contents
will be completely destroyed.

412
00:31:13,895 --> 00:31:15,090
I understand.

413
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:18,665
The officials at Le Bourget Field
will telephone you at your rooms...

414
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:20,961
as soon as flying is possible.

415
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:22,364
It is imperative...

416
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:26,633
that these dispatches be in Petrograd
as soon as human means can contrive.

417
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,070
Yes, Your Excellency.

418
00:31:28,276 --> 00:31:30,939
Mr. Palin will have these sealed
and delivered to you.

419
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:33,672
And now, goodbye and good luck.

420
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,815
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Lieutenant.

421
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:40,284
On your way, inquire if General Shubin
has any further instructions.

422
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,225
Don't be so secretive.

423
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:47,354
I know that the embassy has received
important news from Russia.

424
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:50,396
Please, don't ask me things.

425
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:52,132
Not tonight.

426
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:55,394
But all you've got to say is yes or no.

427
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:01,135
Well, at least you can tell me
how they came, by courier?

428
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,908
- No.
- By wireless, then.

429
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,476
No.

430
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,283
By airplane.

431
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,448
The airplane from Russia?

432
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:15,188
No.

433
00:32:15,824 --> 00:32:20,023
Please, don't ask me anything more.

434
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,188
I can't stand it.

435
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,130
I can't get that Dubois out of my head.

436
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:30,536
Well, maybe you'd rather be alone.

437
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:34,309
You might as well be.
Your thoughts are not with me.

438
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:37,240
My thoughts are with you always.

439
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:39,047
Are they?

440
00:32:39,381 --> 00:32:42,180
Is that why you haven't kissed
me for hours?

441
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,583
Oh, Mata.

442
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:48,852
What is it?

443
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,392
Lieutenant Rosanoff.

444
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,572
Come in. Come in.

445
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:10,671
May I present Lieutenant Rosanoff.
Madame Mata Hari.

446
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:12,976
I believe we've met before.

447
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:14,611
I don't think so, madame.

448
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:16,215
Well, what is it?

449
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:18,086
I'm flying back tonight, sir.

450
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:21,289
I am to inquire if you have
any further orders.

451
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:25,387
I don't believe so.

452
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:28,787
Surely you are not thinking
of flying in this weather?

453
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:31,156
Rosanoff!

454
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:33,665
- Yes, sir.
- Madame spoke to you.

455
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:35,063
I know it, sir.

456
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,363
Oh, never mind.

457
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,025
You can't expect monsieur
to answer chatter...

458
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,425
with a flight for Russia
on his mind.

459
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:45,910
Safe voyage, monsieur.
Come back to us soon.

460
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:49,143
Paris in the spring...

461
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,876
with all those chestnut blossoms.

462
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,986
Good night, monsieur.

463
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,485
Lieutenant.

464
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:58,120
Yes, sir.

465
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:03,863
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing, sir.

466
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:05,499
Madame spoke to you.

467
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:07,502
There was nothing to answer.

468
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,364
You're insolent.

469
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:13,338
- I advise you to return to your quarters.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:19,113
Impudent fool.

471
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:23,040
I really can't apologize enough for him.

472
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:25,310
He must have been drinking.

473
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:27,820
I thought he was quite nice.

474
00:34:28,056 --> 00:34:29,718
And brave.

475
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:33,558
Flying all the way to Russia.

476
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:40,330
Well, this time you didn't have
to tell me anything, did you?

477
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:43,102
Your conscience is quite clear.

478
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:04,148
I can't believe they'd send a dispatch
that you know nothing about.

479
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:08,658
I've told you, I have nothing
to do with political matters.

480
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:12,424
Mata, if you don't help me forget...

481
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,798
this ghastly business for a few hours,
I'm going insane.

482
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,338
Of course you should forget them.

483
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:22,407
We both will.

484
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:28,841
Well, doesn't matter.

485
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,683
- He wouldn't dare.
- Who wouldn't dare?

486
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:33,316
Dubois.

487
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:35,180
What about him?

488
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:39,592
I was only thinking if he were to search
my rooms while I am here...

489
00:35:39,828 --> 00:35:41,490
What are you driving at?

490
00:35:41,996 --> 00:35:43,464
It doesn't matter.

491
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:47,268
But those official figures
that you sent me—

492
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:49,027
You haven't destroyed them?

493
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,636
- Not yet.
- How could you be so careless?

494
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:57,970
I suppose it was a little careless,
but they're safely hidden away.

495
00:35:58,246 --> 00:36:02,479
But Dubois may be there now.
It may be too late.

496
00:36:03,051 --> 00:36:04,576
You must go.

497
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:09,716
I wouldn't think of leaving you
for something that can't possibly happen.

498
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:12,217
Please, I can't stand it.

499
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:13,923
Come.

500
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:18,131
I'd go myself, but I'm sure
they're watching the house.

501
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:23,229
Please, now, don't lose a moment.

502
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:26,441
Telephone me the moment
that you've destroyed them.

503
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:29,143
- Not safe.
- Well, then come back here.

504
00:36:29,377 --> 00:36:31,744
Of course I will.

505
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,814
Don't worry.

506
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:06,370
- Hey, get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

507
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:08,981
Back up! Back up! Back up, will you!

508
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,753
Good evening, Mother Durand.

509
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:52,722
Come quick.

510
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,403
Call Andriani.

511
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:07,242
Tell him to send B-14
to Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff's at once.

512
00:38:07,575 --> 00:38:09,840
Right here is the address.

513
00:38:12,814 --> 00:38:16,080
He must wait outside...

514
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:38,136
Am I allowed to come in?

515
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:46,772
Why did you come here?

516
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,579
To see you.

517
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,678
You finished your rendezvous early.

518
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:53,319
No, I ran away from it.

519
00:38:53,521 --> 00:38:54,716
Why?

520
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:57,289
Because of you.

521
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,460
I'm afraid that Shubin was furious.

522
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:09,799
- I can't make you out.
- I can't either.

523
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,806
Are you still angry?

524
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,766
Haven't I the right to be?

525
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:17,035
- This morning you acted like—
- I can explain.

526
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:19,577
And tonight I find you alone
with Shubin.

527
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:22,613
Alexis, don't think wrong of me.

528
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:26,014
Artists need help and influence.

529
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:29,251
And Shubin can do
so much to help my career.

530
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,888
- So I can imagine.
- But we are nothing to each other.

531
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:39,532
Please be glad to see me.

532
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,639
Are you sorry I came?

533
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:55,850
No.

534
00:39:57,085 --> 00:40:00,249
Well, then, look at me.

535
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:11,426
Please.

536
00:40:12,533 --> 00:40:14,968
Please forgive me.

537
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:32,646
Nice character in this room.

538
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:42,457
- This is the czar, isn't it?
- Yes.

539
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:45,198
- Who's the old gentleman there?
- My father.

540
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,368
I like his face.

541
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:50,697
- And this Madonna?
- The Madonna of Kazan'.

542
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:54,564
My mother made a pilgrimage
to the Shrine of Miracles to get it for me.

543
00:40:55,576 --> 00:40:57,442
It's about 100 miles from our town.

544
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,580
She walked all the way.

545
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,215
What is it supposed to do?

546
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,683
- Bring you luck?
- Oh, no. It guards you from evil.

547
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,680
I had to kneel before the altar...

548
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:12,382
and promise Mother I would always
keep a flame burning before it.

549
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,720
- And have you?
- Of course.

550
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:18,899
My orderly has taken care of it
all the time I've been away.

551
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:22,502
You're a strange boy.

552
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,595
Who loves you.

553
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:26,471
Do you?

554
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:30,704
I love you as one adores sacred things.

555
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:33,905
What sacred things?

556
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:35,981
God...

557
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:37,743
country...

558
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,476
honor...

559
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,086
you.

560
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:43,485
- I come last?
- No.

561
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:46,125
- That's how you said it.
- You come first.

562
00:41:46,394 --> 00:41:48,260
Before anything.

563
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,258
Before...

564
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:53,161
anything?

565
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:57,703
Yes.

566
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,673
There is so much light in here.

567
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:30,137
Put out that one too.

568
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:37,542
- The Madonna's lamp?
- Yes.

569
00:42:38,646 --> 00:42:40,171
I couldn't do that.

570
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:42,110
You said I came first.

571
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:44,682
But don't you understand
that it's a holy lamp?

572
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:47,883
That I swore to keep it burning?

573
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,149
You wouldn't do that for me?

574
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:53,855
Why? Why do you ask me to?

575
00:42:55,496 --> 00:42:59,399
- To see if you love me as you say.
- I do, Mata. I do.

576
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:02,667
Well, then put it out.

577
00:43:04,238 --> 00:43:05,536
If you love me.

578
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:11,673
I'll do anything,
but please don't ask me to do that.

579
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:15,747
- I'm going.
- No.

580
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:39,129
Forgive me.

581
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:19,967
Steady.

582
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:30,284
Steady.

583
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,627
You are still here, sir.

584
00:48:34,835 --> 00:48:36,895
- And they didn't telephone?
- Yes, someone did.

585
00:48:37,137 --> 00:48:40,130
- Then the plans have been changed.
- I didn't answer. Get me a taxi.

586
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:43,037
- You didn't answer? Why not?
- I told you to get me a taxi.

587
00:48:43,243 --> 00:48:45,474
If anyone calls, you tell them I'm out.
Quickly!

588
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:47,170
Yes, sir.

589
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:17,678
- Lieutenant Rosanoff?
- Gone out.

590
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:20,210
- This is his servant.
- Where'd Rosanoff go?

591
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:23,942
- He went to the embassy a long time ago.
- Impossible. We just came from there.

592
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:26,483
- Then he must have met with an accident.
- But when?

593
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:29,179
- Oh, these Paris taxis.
- Come on.

594
00:49:29,657 --> 00:49:32,126
I hope it's not a bad accident.

595
00:49:34,094 --> 00:49:36,461
I have to see her.
I'll wait here till I do see her.

596
00:49:36,664 --> 00:49:38,030
Madame Mata Hari is not in.

597
00:49:38,232 --> 00:49:39,700
- Where is she?
- I don't know, sir.

598
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:43,370
- Where would she be? Who are her friends?
- I don't know. Where would she be?

599
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:45,368
Where would she be?

600
00:49:46,473 --> 00:49:50,171
- General Shubin's?
- I've told you, sir, I don't know.

601
00:49:51,512 --> 00:49:52,912
All right.

602
00:49:54,148 --> 00:49:58,347
While I know you'll hate to leave Paris,
I must ask you to go on a little mission.

603
00:49:58,585 --> 00:50:01,521
- Yes? Where?
- To Marseilles.

604
00:50:03,123 --> 00:50:05,149
- Marseilles?
- Yes.

605
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:07,691
Oh, no. Don't do that to me, Andriani.

606
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:09,955
Think of how I've served,
the work I've done.

607
00:50:10,197 --> 00:50:12,189
- Have pity on me.
- No, no. There's no need...

608
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:13,765
of you becoming hysterical.

609
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:17,267
You're simply being ordered to Marseilles
to meet our Spanish agent.

610
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,566
- What is so terrifying about that?
- It means my number's up. I know.

611
00:50:20,774 --> 00:50:23,767
You think I'm a traitor. I'm not.
I'll swear by everything I hold sacred.

612
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:25,980
And what do you hold sacred?

613
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:29,013
There's a train tonight.

614
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:32,210
Brille has your tickets.

615
00:50:32,453 --> 00:50:33,978
I won't go.

616
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:38,352
I won't go meekly to be slaughtered.

617
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,721
Remember, this is Paris,
not the Wilhelmstrasse.

618
00:50:40,928 --> 00:50:43,830
If you force me to be a traitor,
I'll go to the French police...

619
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,728
and tell them everything I know.
They'll protect me.

620
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:49,096
You ought to know.

621
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:05,184
Jacques.

622
00:51:26,477 --> 00:51:29,504
Now, now, now.
What's the matter, dearie?

623
00:51:29,758 --> 00:51:31,101
Not feeling well?

624
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:43,755
Hello, Mata.

625
00:51:44,158 --> 00:51:47,686
Well, if everybody obeyed orders
as loyally as you do...

626
00:51:48,128 --> 00:51:49,494
Thank you.

627
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:53,397
- Any further orders for me?
- Yes.

628
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,762
Yes, here are the photographs
of the dispatches.

629
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:57,442
Take that to Shubin...

630
00:51:57,498 --> 00:52:00,326
and have him send them
in the first diplomatic mail to Holland.

631
00:52:00,419 --> 00:52:02,047
Very well.

632
00:52:04,678 --> 00:52:07,807
- You don't seem to be in very good humor.
- No.

633
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:11,543
I'd think your success of last evening
should put you in the very best of spirits.

634
00:52:11,752 --> 00:52:14,017
- To the contrary.
- Why?

635
00:52:14,221 --> 00:52:17,817
Surely, a simple job like that
needn't have been unpleasant.

636
00:52:18,058 --> 00:52:19,924
Most unpleasant.

637
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,589
He's in love with me.

638
00:52:21,795 --> 00:52:24,264
Well, that's not unusual.

639
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:26,495
He wants me to marry him.

640
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:29,166
Not really? Marry—

641
00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:30,894
Well...

642
00:52:32,472 --> 00:52:34,031
Why is that so funny?

643
00:52:39,313 --> 00:52:40,255
What is it?

644
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:43,197
We are dispensing
with Carlotta's services.

645
00:52:43,283 --> 00:52:45,616
She seems to resent it.

646
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,315
Poor Carlotta.

647
00:52:51,525 --> 00:52:53,517
She shouldn't have fallen in love.

648
00:52:53,994 --> 00:52:57,590
I've warned her and you
about that before.

649
00:52:58,765 --> 00:53:03,135
I am surprised she didn't respect
your wishes in the matter.

650
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,339
She was afraid of you.

651
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:07,871
Ours is an exacting profession.

652
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:13,043
We're permitted no friends, no emotions,
no personal life of our own.

653
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:14,772
What are you driving at?

654
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:18,346
I'm simply reminding
you that a spy in love...

655
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:22,080
is a tool that has outlived
its usefulness.

656
00:53:22,623 --> 00:53:26,121
You're so subtle.
You imagine that I am in love?

657
00:53:26,222 --> 00:53:27,589
Well, I did think for a moment...

658
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:30,603
that you were taking this Rosanoff
a little too seriously.

659
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:33,497
I never expect to see Rosanoff again.

660
00:53:34,101 --> 00:53:36,002
I never want to.

661
00:53:38,372 --> 00:53:41,365
But it's not because I'm worried
by any threats of yours.

662
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:43,066
But I want you to see him again.

663
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,779
He may continue
to be very, very useful to us.

664
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:47,276
- Not to me.
- But—

665
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:50,508
I don't ever want to touch
that boy's life again.

666
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:26,651
Hello.

667
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,449
What?

668
00:54:28,722 --> 00:54:29,985
Yes.

669
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,950
He did not report to the flying field?

670
00:54:34,394 --> 00:54:37,489
Tell His Excellency I'll be there
as quickly as possible.

671
00:54:38,398 --> 00:54:40,867
- Ivan! My tunic.
- Yes, sir.

672
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,763
Hurry, hurry.

673
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:47,238
I knew this was going to be
an unlucky day when I woke up.

674
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:52,143
Put it down. Put it down!

675
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,379
Get me a dozen orchids and take them
to Madame Mata Hari.

676
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:00,577
Take this note along with it.
Meet me at the embassy.

677
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:02,346
Yes, sir.

678
00:55:05,926 --> 00:55:08,088
Monsieur Dubois.

679
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:10,288
Good morning, my friend.

680
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:13,691
- Good morning.
- Oh, no. No one would ever forgive that.

681
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,098
To spoil a man's supper,
then come back and spoil his breakfast.

682
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:19,273
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

683
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:23,324
Well, what is it today?
More melodrama?

684
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:24,427
No, no.

685
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:28,009
- Today it is a farce.
- Oh, indeed. I see.

686
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:31,811
Last night I was bold enough
to hint at a relationship...

687
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:34,818
between you and a certain lady.
And I've come to apologize...

688
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:38,686
because I was mistaken.
Oh, yes, because I discovered...

689
00:55:38,892 --> 00:55:42,420
that this lady's inclinations
are entirely elsewhere.

690
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:44,389
- Oh, yes?
- Oh, yes.

691
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:49,360
We older men merely furnish the soft lights
and champagne.

692
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:50,898
The mood, as it were.

693
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:55,007
Youth whistles, and we? We spend
the rest of the evening reading a book.

694
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:58,309
Just what are you trying to get at?

695
00:55:58,545 --> 00:56:02,573
Merely this, that Mata Hari went straight
to the rooms of young Rosanoff...

696
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:06,511
when she left here last night.
And the previous night, he was with her.

697
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,951
In what way does this concern me?

698
00:56:09,156 --> 00:56:13,560
Well, it doesn't. It merely illustrates
what a fool I made of myself.

699
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,092
Yes, yes.

700
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:19,289
Well, if you will pardon me, I have a most
important engagement at the embassy.

701
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:21,627
I'm very sorry to detain you.
It's stupid of me.

702
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:24,430
But I had to drop in
and apologize for my silly mistake.

703
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:26,971
- Very kind of you. Yes, charming.
- Good morning.

704
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:57,957
Did it work?

705
00:56:57,982 --> 00:56:59,876
I don't know yet.
He seemed calm enough.

706
00:56:59,945 --> 00:57:03,245
But there may be quite
an interesting reaction. We shall see.

707
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:13,210
Shubin?

708
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,188
Shubin?

709
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:18,223
What's happened?

710
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,053
A private air raid?

711
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,523
You cheat.

712
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,251
You liar.

713
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:25,883
"Good morning, liar"
would be more polite.

714
00:57:26,066 --> 00:57:29,366
- Be quiet, you—
- We'll omit the pet names.

715
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:31,970
- Come to the point.
- Rosanoff. That's the point.

716
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:35,836
You were with him all last night.
Dubois told me.

717
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:38,978
How does he know?
Did he look through the keyhole?

718
00:57:39,179 --> 00:57:42,149
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.

719
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:44,247
Of course I was with him.

720
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,911
He had information I wanted,
and I got it.

721
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:48,419
That's all.

722
00:57:57,197 --> 00:58:00,565
You didn't think I went there
because of—?

723
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:05,501
Can't you understand why Dubois
is doing this?

724
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:09,067
- He knows what you mean to me.
- You're lying.

725
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:12,246
You love that boy, and I know it.

726
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,742
Would I have taken this
if I loved him?

727
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:17,277
What is it?

728
00:58:17,817 --> 00:58:20,286
Photographs of his dispatches to Russia.

729
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:23,283
Doesn't that convince you?

730
00:58:37,204 --> 00:58:40,436
Yes, I'm quite convinced.
Convinced it's not the whole truth.

731
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,804
What about the night before last?
Did he have the dispatches then?

732
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:46,741
No, he did not have the dispatches then.

733
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:51,612
But he had you, huh?
That's what Dubois said.

734
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:54,117
We older men supply the champagne.

735
00:58:54,354 --> 00:58:59,054
But when youth sings, the old fool
stays home and pays the piper.

736
00:58:59,693 --> 00:59:01,559
That's what Dubois said.

737
00:59:02,262 --> 00:59:03,560
Hello.

738
00:59:03,863 --> 00:59:05,957
- Wagram-600.
- What are you doing?

739
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:09,111
I think it's only fair
to apologize to Dubois.

740
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:11,322
After all, he was
right, you know.

741
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:14,207
Hello, Monsieur Dubois?

742
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:15,739
Who's calling?

743
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:17,240
Hold the wire.

744
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,274
General Shubin on number three.

745
00:59:21,214 --> 00:59:24,150
Yes? Dubois speaking.

746
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:29,322
Will you please repeat that?
I didn't quite hear you.

747
00:59:29,556 --> 00:59:33,118
You were right. She is a spy.

748
00:59:33,493 --> 00:59:36,053
I'll give you all the proof you want.

749
00:59:36,296 --> 00:59:38,356
Well, come over! She's here.

750
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:40,158
I'll keep her here.

751
00:59:43,503 --> 00:59:46,667
Get me a car quick.
At last, I've got Mata Hari.

752
00:59:46,873 --> 00:59:48,899
You've been cheating men
all your life.

753
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:53,604
But there'll be 12 men you won't cheat,
the firing squad.

754
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,513
No firing squad for me, Shubin.

755
00:59:57,017 --> 00:59:59,509
It'll be your word against mine.

756
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:02,516
And after all, I have friends.

757
01:00:03,123 --> 01:00:06,184
Paris will laugh at you.
A jealous, hysterical fool.

758
01:00:06,393 --> 01:00:10,854
Perhaps not. You and Rosanoff may get
out of this, but I don't think so.

759
01:00:12,132 --> 01:00:13,657
Rosanoff?

760
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:16,526
- And what has he to do with it?
- Everything.

761
01:00:16,803 --> 01:00:20,763
Rosanoff is a traitor.
He permitted you to copy his dispatches.

762
01:00:20,974 --> 01:00:22,704
- That's not true.
- Fortunately...

763
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:26,243
this time it isn't a question
of anyone's word. I have proof.

764
01:00:26,746 --> 01:00:29,716
Proof that you gave me yourself.

765
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:35,780
You've stood that boy against a wall,
just as surely as you're standing there.

766
01:00:36,556 --> 01:00:39,526
I never knew that anyone
could be so vile.

767
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:42,921
Vile? Not at all, madame,
I'm simply doing my duty.

768
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:46,998
How ironic, you love a man
and send him to his death.

769
01:00:48,668 --> 01:00:49,863
Hello.

770
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,198
- Official-27.
- Don't do it, Shubin.

771
01:00:52,405 --> 01:00:53,634
I beg you not to do it.

772
01:00:53,873 --> 01:00:55,933
Hello?
His Excellency's secretary, please.

773
01:00:56,142 --> 01:01:00,045
- Leave him out of this. He's innocent.
- Hello, this is General Shubin speaking...

774
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:03,239
- ... I must speak to His Excellency at once.
- I'm warning you.

775
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,147
- Don't, don't do it!
- Hello, Your Excellency?

776
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:08,117
I'm coming to the embassy at once.

777
01:01:08,321 --> 01:01:10,552
I must speak to you
on a most urgent matter.

778
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:12,749
Shubin, if you don't stop—

779
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:14,426
- Hello, Excellency?
- Shubin!

780
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:15,837
I'll explain when I arrive.

781
01:01:15,908 --> 01:01:19,385
In the meantime,
order the immediate arrest of—

782
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,634
- What do you want here?
- You.

783
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:38,937
Why, you must be mad.
Why haven't you left yet?

784
01:02:39,191 --> 01:02:40,176
But I—

785
01:02:40,217 --> 01:02:43,170
I told you.
I told you I'm not for you.

786
01:02:43,516 --> 01:02:45,451
Before I go, I want to tell you this.

787
01:02:45,652 --> 01:02:48,747
Whatever you've been,
whatever you are, whatever you will be...

788
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:51,948
- ... we belong to each other.
- Alexis, it can't be.

789
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:56,926
I am what I am. You don't know me.
Go away and forget me.

790
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:00,225
Forget you? How can I?

791
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:04,234
- Could you? Could you forget us?
- Women like me are trained to forget.

792
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:06,032
We mustn't admit a heart.

793
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,731
- You are lying. You know you are lying.
- I am not.

794
01:03:08,942 --> 01:03:10,740
- You are.
- No!

795
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:19,783
You're crying, Mata. You do love me.

796
01:03:19,986 --> 01:03:21,545
Don't you?

797
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,689
Don't you?

798
01:03:26,192 --> 01:03:29,253
- Alexis, you must leave.
- I won't. I won't until you come.

799
01:03:29,462 --> 01:03:31,192
- It's your duty to go.
- No.

800
01:03:31,397 --> 01:03:34,993
Alexis, please go now.

801
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:40,196
When it's all over, if you still want me,
I'll come to you no matter where you are.

802
01:03:40,406 --> 01:03:43,308
I'll come to you, I swear it.

803
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,002
But go now.

804
01:04:42,635 --> 01:04:46,037
General Shubin? General Shubin?

805
01:04:50,877 --> 01:04:54,006
General Shubin, Dubois speaking.

806
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:03,089
Something strange about this.
You got something to open this door?

807
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:04,848
- I'll get something.
- Yeah.

808
01:05:05,058 --> 01:05:07,550
- Will this do?
- Yes, fine.

809
01:05:23,343 --> 01:05:25,403
- That's hardly a surprise.
- Suicide.

810
01:05:25,612 --> 01:05:28,047
- Suicide.
- He's only been dead a few minutes.

811
01:05:28,247 --> 01:05:32,082
Probably long enough for Madame Mata Hari
to destroy all the proof he told us about.

812
01:05:32,285 --> 01:05:33,617
- Who are you?
- Russian embassy.

813
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:38,190
Shubin was talking to His Excellency.
There was a woman's scream and a shot.

814
01:05:38,391 --> 01:05:40,587
- See if she's overlooked anything.
- Is he dead?

815
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:43,695
- Yes. A woman's voice, huh?
- Screaming.

816
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:46,195
And the word of a dead man.

817
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,233
Come on.

818
01:06:18,965 --> 01:06:20,866
All the papers are saying it's a suicide.

819
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:23,935
If everyone's convinced,
what's the use of my hiding like this?

820
01:06:24,137 --> 01:06:26,436
Dubois may be doing that
merely to trap you.

821
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:29,123
It's unfortunate you found it
necessary to—

822
01:06:29,271 --> 01:06:31,124
I'm the best judge of that.

823
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:34,109
- Have you still got you Dutch passport?
- Yes.

824
01:06:34,313 --> 01:06:37,374
It doesn't suit my plans
to have you arrested.

825
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,449
You're sailing tonight for Amsterdam.

826
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,261
I'll go anyplace gladly
after three days of this.

827
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:44,599
It's too ridiculous.

828
01:06:44,725 --> 01:06:48,628
And furthermore, your usefulness
in Paris is permanently over.

829
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:54,097
Here is the list of the Allied agents
in Belgium.

830
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,769
Commit those names to memory
and then destroy it.

831
01:06:56,969 --> 01:07:00,963
And report to H-12 immediately
you arrive in Amsterdam.

832
01:07:06,412 --> 01:07:08,643
- Come in.
- Well, what is it?

833
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:11,317
- Madame sent for me.
- Yes.

834
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:13,543
I want him to get a letter through.

835
01:07:15,288 --> 01:07:19,726
- For Lieutenant Rosanoff.
- Rosanoff? But he is—

836
01:07:19,926 --> 01:07:23,226
- What is it? What were you going to say?
- Well, I—

837
01:07:23,429 --> 01:07:25,989
Get out. Get out!

838
01:07:32,038 --> 01:07:35,270
Something's happened to him.
Tell me what it is.

839
01:07:35,475 --> 01:07:37,944
He's dead.

840
01:07:42,448 --> 01:07:43,609
Dead?

841
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:47,286
- How?
- Plane crash.

842
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:50,252
Just this side of the enemy line.

843
01:07:53,993 --> 01:07:57,157
It's too late to do anything for him now.
No sense in your risking—

844
01:07:57,363 --> 01:08:00,731
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, maybe I'm wrong, of course.

845
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:05,200
Maybe he's only injured.
Yes, that's it, I think.

846
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:08,340
Well, can't you remember?
You must remember.

847
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:11,375
Why is it so important to you?
Where are you going?

848
01:08:11,577 --> 01:08:14,445
- I'm going to find out.
- Wait a minute. Don't lose your head.

849
01:08:14,647 --> 01:08:17,173
After all, he's not dead,
he's only injured.

850
01:08:17,383 --> 01:08:20,581
- And where is he?
- I don't know, some hospital, I suppose.

851
01:08:20,787 --> 01:08:22,653
- Well, I'll find out.
- And be arrested?

852
01:08:22,855 --> 01:08:25,950
The police are probably looking
for you now.

853
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:35,226
- Remember, you have your orders.
- What do I care for your orders?

854
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:38,097
You can't frighten me.
I'm not Carlotta.

855
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:42,336
I'm Mata Hari and my own master.

856
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:45,034
Here are your orders. I resign.

857
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:48,612
- Not so loud, someone will hear you.
- Oh, so you resign?

858
01:08:49,348 --> 01:08:52,648
Very well, Mata Hari,
I accept your resignation.

859
01:08:54,854 --> 01:08:57,881
- You'll let her resign?
- My dear Durand, you ought to know.

860
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:01,026
The only way to resign
from our profession is to die.

861
01:09:14,574 --> 01:09:16,202
- Wait here.
- Yes, ma'am.

862
01:09:16,409 --> 01:09:19,345
Flowers, madame. Flowers.
Nice flowers.

863
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:22,538
- How much?
- Two francs.

864
01:09:25,017 --> 01:09:26,451
Thank you.

865
01:09:46,205 --> 01:09:49,369
- Room 1, that corridor.
- Thank you.

866
01:10:11,998 --> 01:10:14,331
Could you tell me...?

867
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,626
Could you tell me where Room 1 is?

868
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:23,576
I'm afraid you'll have
to ask someone else.

869
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:28,468
Sister Teresa, some water, please.

870
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:51,897
Here. Here it is.

871
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:03,466
Mata.

872
01:12:05,511 --> 01:12:09,812
It's all my fault, Alexis.
If I hadn't kept you...

873
01:12:10,016 --> 01:12:12,713
If I'd let you go sooner,
this wouldn't have happened.

874
01:12:12,918 --> 01:12:17,913
It would have happened just the same.
Really, Mata, you mustn't blame yourself.

875
01:12:18,124 --> 01:12:20,616
I'll spend my life trying
to make it up to you.

876
01:12:20,826 --> 01:12:22,920
Oh, but I'm going to be all—

877
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:27,225
- I'll be out of here any day now.
- On that day, we'll be married.

878
01:12:27,433 --> 01:12:29,197
But, Mata...

879
01:12:29,402 --> 01:12:34,670
You asked me, didn't you?
There is so much ahead of us.

880
01:12:34,874 --> 01:12:37,434
Everything.
But I must tell you something.

881
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:40,306
And as soon as the war is over,
we'll go away...

882
01:12:40,513 --> 01:12:43,415
to all the places
that were made for lovers.

883
01:12:43,616 --> 01:12:49,021
- And, oh, the things we'll see together.
- Don't, please.

884
01:12:49,221 --> 01:12:53,317
- What?
- I don't want to frighten you, but...

885
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:55,518
What is it?

886
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:58,721
It would be glorious to go with you...

887
01:12:58,931 --> 01:13:03,494
but I may never be able
to see all those splendid things.

888
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:08,333
Is it your eyes?

889
01:13:15,681 --> 01:13:19,675
Here are your eyes.
What's wrong with them?

890
01:13:19,885 --> 01:13:23,378
With those "ridiculously long lashes,"
as you said.

891
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:30,195
Now, please,
it isn't worth crying about.

892
01:13:30,396 --> 01:13:34,561
I'm happier this moment
than I've ever been in all my life.

893
01:13:36,535 --> 01:13:39,232
What do the doctors say?

894
01:13:40,172 --> 01:13:44,610
They aren't very optimistic.
But you know what doctors are.

895
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:46,870
- They don't know anything.
- No.

896
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:50,538
I'll get you great specialists.
They'll make you see.

897
01:13:51,217 --> 01:13:55,416
We'll travel all over the world
till we find the right man.

898
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:58,113
I'll never leave you again.

899
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:31,621
Gentlemen, I appeal to you.
That man, he's been molesting me.

900
01:14:31,824 --> 01:14:34,350
What? I'll handle this.

901
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,495
I haven't done anything.

902
01:14:37,263 --> 01:14:39,823
- Back to Paris. Quick.
- Yes, miss.

903
01:14:41,066 --> 01:14:44,059
Madame, I have a warrant
for your arrest.

904
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:52,274
Be careful you don't have
to apologize again, Dubois.

905
01:14:53,846 --> 01:14:55,314
Now, Monsieur Dubois...

906
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:58,279
you say that General Shubin
admitted over the telephone...

907
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:00,578
- ... that Mata Hari was an enemy spy?
- Yes.

908
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:04,455
- He had indisputable proof she was a spy?
- Yes.

909
01:15:04,657 --> 01:15:07,991
General Shubin told you, also,
that she was there with him...

910
01:15:08,194 --> 01:15:10,288
- ... while he was talking with you?
- Yes.

911
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:14,490
And you went there immediately, and you
found that Shubin had been murdered?

912
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,864
- Yes.
- That's all. Thank you.

913
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:20,699
Does the defense wish to question
the witness?

914
01:15:20,906 --> 01:15:24,968
No, I don't care
to prolong this farce.

915
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:29,080
You've not brought to that stand one
human being who has said that this is so.

916
01:15:29,281 --> 01:15:33,377
- "I know it. I saw it. I swear it."
- The counsel for the defense...

917
01:15:33,586 --> 01:15:36,078
evidently has as poor a memory
as his client.

918
01:15:36,288 --> 01:15:38,484
Didn't General Shubin say
that Mata Hari...

919
01:15:38,691 --> 01:15:41,126
was in his rooms
at the time he was telephoning?

920
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:42,693
Oh, no.

921
01:15:42,895 --> 01:15:49,062
Dubois said that Shubin said
that she was there.

922
01:15:49,935 --> 01:15:52,734
We cannot blame Monsieur Dubois,
of course...

923
01:15:52,938 --> 01:15:55,965
for accepting too readily
whatever information was given to him.

924
01:15:56,976 --> 01:16:02,415
But has he any proof that it was Shubin
who spoke over the telephone?

925
01:16:02,615 --> 01:16:06,052
No. And now I want that.

926
01:16:06,252 --> 01:16:10,087
I demand that the prosecution produce
some one witness...

927
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:12,986
who will swear
to one definite thing...

928
01:16:13,192 --> 01:16:19,257
or I demand that Mata Hari be acquitted
with the apologies of the court.

929
01:16:19,465 --> 01:16:23,835
There is a man who saw Mata Hari
at General Shubin's that morning.

930
01:16:24,036 --> 01:16:26,972
This man was overheard
by a nurse in the hospital...

931
01:16:27,172 --> 01:16:29,164
discussing this fact
with the prisoner.

932
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:32,140
Overheard. Overheard.
Something more overheard.

933
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:35,576
Why don't you bring him here
and let me question him under oath?

934
01:16:35,781 --> 01:16:39,718
I had hoped to avoid bringing to court
a brave young officer...

935
01:16:39,918 --> 01:16:42,911
recently blinded
in the course of heroic duty.

936
01:16:43,122 --> 01:16:47,355
But if the defense demands it,
summon Lieutenant Alexis Rosanoff.

937
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:49,790
No, no, no. He knows nothing of this.

938
01:16:49,995 --> 01:16:53,727
All he can say is what I said to him
as I came out of that room.

939
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:57,266
When you came out of what room,
Mata Hari? What room?

940
01:16:57,469 --> 01:16:59,961
I'll tell you. Shubin's room!

941
01:17:00,172 --> 01:17:03,768
Your witnesses were perjured.
You have no alibi.

942
01:17:03,976 --> 01:17:07,174
When Shubin called you a spy
over the telephone, he told the truth.

943
01:17:07,379 --> 01:17:10,872
And you knew it, and you shot him
in an attempt to save yourself.

944
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:17,455
But it has not saved you, Mata Hari.
You stand proven an enemy of France.

945
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:26,558
Sister Teresa,
will you read this to me once more?

946
01:17:27,132 --> 01:17:29,328
For the last time.

947
01:17:30,736 --> 01:17:33,934
- For the last time?
- Yes.

948
01:17:37,142 --> 01:17:42,911
"Dearest, I shall not be able to see you
or even to write to you...

949
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:45,346
for some time to come.

950
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:52,014
A sudden attack, nothing really serious,
has caused my removal to a sanitarium.

951
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:54,718
You must not be alarmed...

952
01:17:54,927 --> 01:18:00,059
because the only pain I feel
is that of being without you."

953
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:05,876
"And when it becomes too sharp,

954
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:09,244
I think of all the happiness
we have had together...

955
01:18:09,475 --> 01:18:11,876
and that which we are going to have.

956
01:18:12,845 --> 01:18:15,212
Then I can bear anything.

957
01:18:16,048 --> 01:18:21,578
Good night, Alexis.
Tomorrow is sure to be glorious.

958
01:18:22,054 --> 01:18:25,286
It brings me closer to you.

959
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:28,154
Mata."

960
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:35,123
In the name of the French Republic,
this court finds the accused, Mata Hari...

961
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:40,238
guilty of espionage and of communicating
military information to the enemy.

962
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:41,985
Therefore, this said court,

963
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:45,731
by virtue of articles 205,
6 and 7 of the military code...

964
01:18:45,911 --> 01:18:50,508
condemns this woman to be shot
to death by rifle fire.

965
01:19:06,498 --> 01:19:08,296
On display!

966
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:12,833
Left.

967
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:27,444
- Any news about the reprieve?
- We are expecting her lawyer any minute.

968
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:30,122
Oh, it's getting close to 5:00.

969
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:31,813
Here.

970
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:37,459
Give her that. Cognac.
That'll put heart into you.

971
01:19:37,663 --> 01:19:40,064
- You're a good man.
- Good?

972
01:19:40,265 --> 01:19:43,724
Because I give a dying woman a drink?

973
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:48,266
You don't want jewelry
and you can't use clothes.

974
01:19:48,474 --> 01:19:51,137
- What can I give you?
- There's nothing.

975
01:19:51,343 --> 01:19:53,972
We have everything we need.

976
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:56,671
Everything you need?

977
01:19:56,882 --> 01:20:02,185
- How is that possible?
- We serve God and are content.

978
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:10,187
I wonder if I could be like that if I had
to do it all over again from the beginning.

979
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:15,067
No.

980
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:19,905
That's how I am,
and that's how I had to be.

981
01:20:23,609 --> 01:20:28,741
No, little Sister,
mustn't waste your tears on me.

982
01:20:28,947 --> 01:20:31,109
Madame, Maître Caron.

983
01:20:31,316 --> 01:20:34,718
Oh, he's come to bring the reprieve.

984
01:20:39,157 --> 01:20:42,218
My dear, dear child.

985
01:20:46,832 --> 01:20:50,325
- No?
- I tried everything.

986
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:53,631
I appealed to the highest quarters.

987
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:57,867
I know you did.

988
01:20:59,344 --> 01:21:01,006
Come and sit down.

989
01:21:06,818 --> 01:21:11,654
I spent a whole hour with the president,
who is one of my oldest friends, but—

990
01:21:11,857 --> 01:21:13,689
What about Alexis?

991
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:18,626
That's all settled, just as you wanted it.
He's downstairs now.

992
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:21,425
- I'll—
- Wait.

993
01:21:29,074 --> 01:21:31,543
Will you give him this...

994
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:33,336
afterwards?

995
01:21:33,545 --> 01:21:38,347
- And be very gentle with him.
- Of course, my child.

996
01:21:39,284 --> 01:21:44,348
I hope I have written the things
that'll help him most.

997
01:21:44,556 --> 01:21:48,186
And if I haven't,
perhaps you will know what to say.

998
01:21:48,393 --> 01:21:50,362
I'll know what to say.

999
01:21:50,562 --> 01:21:53,464
That in having your love
even for a little while...

1000
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:56,965
he had more than most men ever have.

1001
01:21:57,469 --> 01:21:59,028
No.

1002
01:22:00,038 --> 01:22:04,442
Just tell him that no matter what
he hears about me...

1003
01:22:04,643 --> 01:22:06,976
and he will hear things...

1004
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:12,510
that my love for him was honest.

1005
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:16,385
That's all.

1006
01:22:16,588 --> 01:22:18,921
Except that he must be happy.

1007
01:22:19,124 --> 01:22:23,528
Must laugh and love.

1008
01:22:24,396 --> 01:22:27,195
And then, someday,
when he's an old man...

1009
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:30,699
and his grandchildren ask him
about Mata Hari...

1010
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:36,536
he must tell a great lie, say that she
was a wonderfully good woman.

1011
01:22:37,309 --> 01:22:39,938
And that'll be my heaven.

1012
01:22:40,612 --> 01:22:44,447
- Now will you ask him to come up?
- At once.

1013
01:22:47,319 --> 01:22:49,720
Sister, the young man is blind.

1014
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:53,050
I've told him that this is a sanitarium.
You must be careful.

1015
01:22:53,258 --> 01:22:56,057
They will. They understand.

1016
01:23:03,235 --> 01:23:05,033
Come.

1017
01:23:05,537 --> 01:23:07,972
Take care of the steps.

1018
01:23:13,596 --> 01:23:16,721
Madame,
I'm leaving the door open...

1019
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:19,817
so that the visitor won't hear
the rattle of the lock.

1020
01:23:20,052 --> 01:23:22,283
Bless you.

1021
01:23:26,858 --> 01:23:29,191
Alexis.

1022
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:47,374
Come, nurses. We'll look
at the patient in the next room...

1023
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:52,176
- ... and leave these young people alone.
- Thank you, doctor.

1024
01:24:00,092 --> 01:24:01,788
This is most irregular.

1025
01:24:02,794 --> 01:24:07,823
And after the operation, how much longer
will you have to stay here?

1026
01:24:08,033 --> 01:24:10,025
I don't know.

1027
01:24:10,235 --> 01:24:13,364
- I'll be well soon, I hope.
- Of course you will.

1028
01:24:13,572 --> 01:24:15,632
- And so will I.
- What?

1029
01:24:15,841 --> 01:24:18,640
The doctors say now that with time
and the right treatment...

1030
01:24:18,844 --> 01:24:23,441
there is every chance I'll see again.
See you again.

1031
01:24:25,617 --> 01:24:29,315
That's the one thing I needed
to give me strength.

1032
01:24:30,822 --> 01:24:35,920
Mata, you are telling me the truth?
It isn't a dangerous operation?

1033
01:24:36,128 --> 01:24:40,224
No. No, it's very slight, really.

1034
01:24:41,066 --> 01:24:45,561
And in a short time, we'll forget all this
and be so happy.

1035
01:24:45,771 --> 01:24:49,367
Just the same, I can't bear
to think of you suffering.

1036
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:52,877
- Alexis?
- Yes.

1037
01:24:53,578 --> 01:24:57,015
- Promise me you won't worry about me.
- Oh, Mata, please.

1038
01:24:57,215 --> 01:24:59,013
Now, promise me.

1039
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:01,107
You know what operations are.

1040
01:25:01,193 --> 01:25:03,990
Even the slightest,
there's always a chance.

1041
01:25:04,584 --> 01:25:08,282
Promise me.
If something should happen to me...

1042
01:25:08,493 --> 01:25:11,588
you won't grieve too much,
that you'll carry on.

1043
01:25:11,797 --> 01:25:15,199
But nothing will happen to you.
You mustn't be afraid.

1044
01:25:17,002 --> 01:25:19,267
Well, then hold me.

1045
01:25:20,839 --> 01:25:24,173
I won't be afraid if you hold me.

1046
01:25:43,662 --> 01:25:45,494
Is it time?

1047
01:25:47,499 --> 01:25:51,664
The doctor and the nurses,
they've come to take me.

1048
01:25:52,137 --> 01:25:55,130
Already? Why need it be so early?

1049
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,935
Well, they always operate
early in the morning.

1050
01:25:58,143 --> 01:26:01,409
And the sooner I go,
the sooner it's over.

1051
01:26:02,169 --> 01:26:04,864
All right,
but you mustn't be frightened.

1052
01:26:05,770 --> 01:26:07,715
I'll wait right here till
they bring you back.

1053
01:26:07,981 --> 01:26:09,943
No, no. I don't want you to.

1054
01:26:10,356 --> 01:26:12,559
Monsieur Caron is waiting
to take you back.

1055
01:26:12,879 --> 01:26:15,269
He'll let you know just how I am.

1056
01:26:15,794 --> 01:26:19,287
- Very soon.
- You are afraid.

1057
01:26:19,497 --> 01:26:23,730
- No.
- You needn't be. I've been through it.

1058
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:27,770
The anesthetic is unpleasant,
but that's all.

1059
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:44,487
- Goodbye, my beloved.
- Oh, you sound so tragic.

1060
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:51,161
- Goodbye, my beloved. Is that better?
- Yes, darling.

1061
01:27:03,808 --> 01:27:07,472
Courage. Courage, my dear. Be brave.

1062
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:20,416
Goodbye.

1063
01:27:21,459 --> 01:27:23,428
Goodbye.

1064
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:48,453
God, save her. Protect her.

1065
01:27:49,558 --> 01:27:52,482
And if you must take her, take me too.
