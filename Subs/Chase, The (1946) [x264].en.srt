1
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,690
Yes, what is it?

2
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,050
Uh, can I see Mr. Roman?

3
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,931
Roman? What do you
want to see him about?

4
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,871
Well, I'd like to give him
something that belongs to him.

5
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,140
What do you want?

6
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,780
Uh, can I see Mr. Roman?

7
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,704
What do you
want to see him about?

8
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,480
I'd like to give him
something that belongs to him.

9
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Come inside.

10
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
What was it you just said at the door?

11
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,406
I said I wanted to see Mr. Roman.

12
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,236
What for?

13
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,166
Well, I've got something for him.

14
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:25,866
Could mean a lot of things.

15
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:27,686
What have you got?

16
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,665
Well, you're not Mr. Roman.

17
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:33,386
How do you know?

18
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:36,807
Well, you just don't fit.

19
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,938
Is it all right, Mr. Gino?

20
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,980
I guess it's all right.

21
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:44,988
I'd better take him in myself. Come on.

22
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:02,853
Wait here.

23
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Si, Eddie there.

24
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
You like it?

25
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
That's all right.

26
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,400
You're a good barber, Miss Garnish.

27
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,977
Oh, thank you, Mr. Roman.

28
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
How do you feel?

29
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,426
I mean, how does it feel being a barber?

30
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,640
Cutting men's hair.

31
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,730
Feels good, huh?

32
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,586
Look at her.
She's blushing.

33
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:08,063
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Roman. You moved.

34
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:09,289
But you didn't.

35
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,970
Quick enough.

36
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,906
Get her out of here.

37
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,639
Stupid dame.

38
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:20,882
You beast.

39
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:22,672
You filthy beast.

40
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:40,853
Hey, you.

41
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,166
That's him.

42
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,680
What can I do for you, Jack?

43
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,342
- Are you Mr. Roman?
- That's right.

44
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,351
Thought you'd like to have this back.

45
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,282
This is mine?

46
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,509
Got your name in it.

47
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,810
Where'd you find it?

48
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:37,290
Well, I don't remember
the name of the street, uh...

49
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,870
It was in front of a restaurant, though.

50
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,010
How much was in it?

51
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,270
Eighty-one dollars.

52
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:47,336
I spent a dollar and a half
for breakfast, and...

53
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,569
There's 79.50 there now.

54
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,933
- How do you like that for an honest guy?
- I don't.

55
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:59,966
Silly law-abiding jerk.

56
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,780
How do you like that?

57
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,220
He comes all the way out
here just because he found it.

58
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,897
You know, you ought to get a medal.

59
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,275
Gino, go buy him a medal.

60
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:13,273
Thanks.

61
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:14,753
I got a medal.

62
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,173
Oh.

63
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Ex-G.I., huh?

64
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,820
Yeah, yes, I was in the Navy.

65
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
I like him.

66
00:09:28,648 --> 00:09:29,850
I want to do something for him.

67
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Give him a sawbuck.

68
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,680
That's the trouble with you, Gino,

69
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:35,892
you have no appreciation for honesty.

70
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,170
Tell me something.

71
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,840
What made you bring the wallet back?

72
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,093
Well, I don't know.

73
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,743
Now that I'm here, I wonder myself.

74
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:54,976
I guess I'm just a sucker.

75
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:01,326
I like that, too.

76
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,508
- Can you drive a car?
- Yes, sir.

77
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,255
Then you got a job.

78
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,900
What do you need two chauffeurs for?

79
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:10,113
- Fire Claverne.
- All right.

80
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:11,261
No, wait a minute.

81
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:13,326
I don't want to take another fellow's job.

82
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:14,939
Take it easy, Jack.

83
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
The name's Scott.

84
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Chuck Scott.

85
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:22,639
Okay, Scotty.

86
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,620
Hello, Fats.

87
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,765
Fats, what do you do besides
talking on the telephone all the time?

88
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,879
Been trying to reach you for 45 minutes.

89
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,079
Oh, never mind that.

90
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
How about Johnson?

91
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:36,270
Did you contact him yet?

92
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,340
What's he stall this time?

93
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Oh.

94
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,280
I'll have him at my house
for dinner Wednesday night.

95
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,215
No, Fats.

96
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,160
Not Thursday.
Wednesday.

97
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,040
Yes? Right.

98
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:10,273
Be right there.

99
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:11,406
Thanks, Job.

100
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,577
Oh, Jobe.

101
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Like in the Bible?

102
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,473
Kings, Chronicles, Ezra,
Nehemiah, Esther, Job?

103
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,130
Fine, I won't forget it. Bye.

104
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Come on, Tony.

105
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,619
You, bitch.

106
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:55,213
Mr. Roman.

107
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,800
There's something wrong,
I can't slow the car down.

108
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,360
Relax, Scotty, I'll take care
of all that back here.

109
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:02,011
You just handle the wheel.

110
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,727
- You mean you...
- That's right.

111
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Yes, sir.

112
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:26,572
He's right on time.

113
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,219
Eddie, you don't know how he drives.

114
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:30,873
We'll find out.

115
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Maybe not.

116
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:39,180
- How do you feel, Scotty?
- Fine.

117
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,475
But I don't get it.

118
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,695
Who does?

119
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,382
You know, he's all right.

120
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
He's a good chauffeur.

121
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,760
You're all right, Scotty.

122
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,900
Thanks.

123
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,093
- What do we do now?
- You take over.

124
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,660
This is all yours.

125
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,060
Well, Mr. Johnson, how
do you like our little house?

126
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,622
Oh, it's charming.

127
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:10,113
However, I never thought I'd enjoy
the pleasure of having dinner here.

128
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,880
You know, Mr. Johnson
had the idea I didn't like him.

129
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,500
Just because he took
away some of my business.

130
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,166
I guess he doesn't know you too well.

131
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:23,116
I must say, there aren't
many men would have taken it

132
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,997
the way your
husband has, Mrs. Roman.

133
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,353
Live and let live.

134
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:31,573
That's my motto.

135
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,023
Isn't that so, Gino?

136
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,460
Oh, the world is big enough for all of us.

137
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,240
You too, Mr. Johnson.

138
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,940
Well, thank you, Gino.

139
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,447
I have a very interesting
house too, in Havana.

140
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,100
I'd be very pleased if you'd all
come and visit me sometime.

141
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,236
You've been in Havana,
haven't you, Mrs. Roman?

142
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,600
No, I've never been there.

143
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,915
No, Mrs. Roman doesn't travel very much.

144
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

145
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,235
- Doctor's orders?
- No, mine.

146
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,820
If you'll excuse me, I'll let
you go on with your business.

147
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,182
Oh, good night, Mr. Johnson.

148
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,215
Good night, Mrs. Roman.

149
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,540
It was nice meeting you.

150
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
Thank you.

151
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,830
She's lovely, isn't she?

152
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,380
Oh, she's beautiful.

153
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,575
How about a little brandy?

154
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,860
Well, I don't mind if I do.

155
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,306
Where's Tommy?

156
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,880
No, he behaved badly.
I put him in a cellar.

157
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:48,166
Oh, Tommy's a dog.

158
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
A big dog.

159
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,540
But I'm not drinking alone, am I?

160
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:53,646
No.

161
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:57,943
Mr. Roman, could I ask
you a very personal question?

162
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,370
Yes, of course.

163
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,560
What is your business, really?

164
00:17:04,246 --> 00:17:08,495
Gino, what business would
you say we were in, really?

165
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,280
Oh, I'd say the amusement business.

166
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
The amusement business?

167
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,600
Yes, strictly for laughs.

168
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,175
All kidding aside, Mr. Johnson,

169
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,996
I still want to buy
those two ships of yours.

170
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:28,653
But I don't want to sell.

171
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,500
Well, maybe we can talk you into it.

172
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,187
What do you say, Mr. Johnson?

173
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,440
Well, I'll think it over.

174
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,440
Oh, no, that'll be too long.

175
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,706
I could let you know tomorrow.

176
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,580
No, tonight. Now.

177
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,839
Well, how much would
you give me for them?

178
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:53,905
Nothing.

179
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,539
Oh, you're joking, huh?

180
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,700
I've had a lovely evening,
but I've got to run along.

181
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,636
We can go into it further-

182
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:15,176
Oh, no, you can't go now, Mr. Johnson,

183
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,356
without seeing
the rest of the house.

184
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,801
We haven't even seen the upstairs.

185
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,774
Or the wine cellar.

186
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,340
Oh, we have a nice wine cellar.

187
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,360
Well, I would like to see the wine cellar.

188
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:29,500
Napoleon brandy!

189
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,580
1815!

190
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,660
Oh, Gino, I don't believe it.

191
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,500
Why, I didn't think there was a bottle of
real Napoleon brandy left in existence.

192
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,461
Why, Gino, do you
realize that... Gino?

193
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:49,157
Gino?

194
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Hey, Gino? Gi-

195
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:58,572
Gino?

196
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:04,053
Gino?

197
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:08,639
Gino?

198
00:19:11,573 --> 00:19:12,573
Hey, Gino!

199
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:23,362
Gino! G-Gino!

200
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:36,703
Oh, no. Gino! G-
Oh, no.

201
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,170
No.

202
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,870
No.

203
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,570
No!

204
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,650
No, no!

205
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:46,150
No! No! No!

206
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:47,785
No, get away!

207
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,445
No!
No!

208
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:50,644
Help!

209
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:52,776
Help!

210
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:53,801
Help!

211
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,566
Turn off here, please.

212
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,260
Standing off too close, miss.

213
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,912
I think you'd better step back.

214
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:56,711
What happened to Clayburn?

215
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
He's gone, miss.

216
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,640
It's Mrs. Roman.

217
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:07,873
I beg your pardon.

218
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,567
I didn't know.

219
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:11,953
Oh, that's all right.

220
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,200
I think I like it better the other way.

221
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,567
Is there anything I can do?

222
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:28,212
Take me back four years ago.

223
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,360
If you can do that, call me "miss".

224
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,553
And if you can't do that,

225
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,772
just look the other way.

226
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,019
You can go back to the car.

227
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,890
What's out there, straight ahead?

228
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,430
Well, Havana, I think.

229
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,283
Have you ever been there?

230
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,802
Yes, I was, a long time ago.

231
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,504
What was it like?

232
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,456
Oh, for me, it was...

233
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,710
cheap hotels, cheap
restaurants, cheap friends...

234
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:56,281
All places are alike when you're broke.

235
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:02,006
It would be worth a thousand dollars to me

236
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,380
to get to Havana.

237
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:05,826
A thousand dollars?

238
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:07,246
Yes.

239
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:10,941
Steamship ticket's only about 30.

240
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,820
I could never make it alone.

241
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Why not?

242
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,460
Have you ever been
afraid? Really afraid.

243
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,987
What do you want me to do?

244
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,403
I want you to take me to Havana.

245
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,050
But why me?

246
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:34,583
I think I can trust you.

247
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,870
You mean you think I look like I...

248
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:41,869
need a thousand dollars?

249
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:44,363
Have it your way,

250
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:48,229
but I still think I can trust you.

251
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:50,436
When can we go?

252
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:52,829
How soon can you leave?

253
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,630
Now, right this minute.

254
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,543
That's a pretty long swim.

255
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,143
I'll check the sailings tomorrow.

256
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:10,164
- Think I'd better take you home now?
- All right.

257
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,095
That'll be 42.20.

258
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,400
Sign there, please.

259
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,699
Two tickets for Havana tonight, please.

260
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,435
I'm sorry, there's no space available.

261
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,785
We're completely sold out.

262
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:28,413
Are you sure?

263
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:31,495
Just a moment.
There may be a cancellation.

264
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,373
Yes, here's one.

265
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,820
But it's a single cabin, will that do you?

266
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:40,669
Yes, it'll have to.

267
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:43,822
- How many tickets?
- Two.

268
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,699
How much is that?

269
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,060
That'll be 57.60.

270
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:52,659
Sign there, please.

271
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:56,839
CSS Cuba.

272
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:59,193
Leaves pair 26 at 11 o'clock tonight.

273
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Thank you, sir.

274
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:02,106
Keep the change.

275
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:03,386
Thank you!

276
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:25,546
Hello.

277
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:27,047
I'll take it, Job.

278
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,367
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Hello.

280
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,932
I got the tickets for Havana.

281
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,400
It's on a ship called the Cuba.

282
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:52,147
Leaves 11 o'clock tonight.

283
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,366
Now, listen carefully.
Have dinner with him as usual.

284
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,510
At 9:30 say you wanna take a drive.
I'll be waiting in my room.

285
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:00,510
Now, don't you call,
have Job call, as usual.

286
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,775
I'll bring the car around.

287
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,710
No, don't worry.
They don't know where I am.

288
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,244
Yes, I'm picking him up
at the Union Bank now.

289
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:09,062
Good. See you later.

290
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:10,716
Bye.

291
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:16,809
Any particular boat?

292
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,790
Flowers, did you take care of them?

293
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:48,463
Yeah. Red and white roses.

294
00:27:48,488 --> 00:27:49,488
Big anchor.

295
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:51,356
150 bucks.

296
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,690
You know way then 15 years ago in Cicero?

297
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,256
Same roses, the same anchor.

298
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,626
<i>Could've picked it up for a double saw bud,</i>

299
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,050
<i>maybe two bits.</i>

300
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:06,569
150 bucks!

301
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,823
Brother, I don't care what they say.
That's inflation.

302
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Scotty.

303
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Yes, sir?

304
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,180
Mrs. Roman goes for a drive almost
every day, doesn't she?

305
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,204
Yes, sir.

306
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:25,673
Where does she go?

307
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:28,012
Nowhere in particular.

308
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,573
What do you mean, nowhere?

309
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,126
Just along the beach.

310
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,929
Always the same place.

311
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,434
Yes, sir. Same place.

312
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,247
- How do you know that?
- I didn't.

313
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,733
I want to go there, Scotty.

314
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,207
Now?

315
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Now.

316
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:53,733
Yes, sir.

317
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,028
What does she see out there?

318
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:09,929
I wouldn't know.

319
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:13,615
What do you see out there, Scotty?

320
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,076
Sky... Water...

321
00:29:22,866 --> 00:29:24,446
Must have a special meaning for her.

322
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:29,533
- What does it mean to you?
- I don't know.

323
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,820
I'm not a psychiatrist.

324
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,686
You don't have to be to figure this out.

325
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Am I right, Gino?

326
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,380
I'd say she was contemplating a voyage.

327
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:52,599
She ever said anything to you about it?

328
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,726
Why would she tell me?

329
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:02,326
You've got the kind of
face women like to talk to.

330
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,466
Are you deaf, what's on-

331
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,020
Eddie, they're gone.

332
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,520
Where do you think they've gone, Gino?

333
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,200
I don't have to think, I know.

334
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,340
To Havana, on the Cuba.

335
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,070
Found it in the wastebasket.

336
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,501
What do you want me to do?

337
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,017
Play the other side.

338
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:54,382
I didn't know you were a musician.

339
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,750
Haven't played in a long time.

340
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:03,612
Still scared?

341
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:06,392
I'm getting over it.

342
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:10,506
But you don't get over three
years of terror in one night.

343
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:14,593
He couldn't follow us here.

344
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,605
- What's our first stop?
- Havana.

345
00:34:27,716 --> 00:34:29,506
Looks like all roads lead to Havana.

346
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,180
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

347
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,786
I owe you a thousand dollars.

348
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:48,933
Who did it belong to before?

349
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:55,280
They don't ask you that when you spend it.

350
00:36:02,723 --> 00:36:03,723
Chuck.

351
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:21,752
- I love you, Chuck.
- I love you, Lorna.

352
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,902
That's not our boat.

353
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,562
- How much time do we have?
- Forget time.

354
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,008
- You think we'll make it?
- We've got to.

355
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:46,758
Señor, el caballo no puede estar aquí
toda la noche.

356
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:52,227
Then what are we stopping here for?

357
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:54,531
El caballo no puede estar aquí
toda la noche.

358
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:55,385
What was that?

359
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,931
The horse is tired.

360
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:00,512
Take us back to the boat.

361
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:04,809
Did you hear me? Take us back to the boat.

362
00:38:04,943 --> 00:38:07,061
I already told you the horse is tired.

363
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,337
Chuck, let's get out.

364
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:24,398
Say, uh... Our boat leaves
in an hour for South America.

365
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,189
How much of a walk is it near the dock?

366
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,850
Yo no entiendo bien inglés.

367
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,150
Vamos, Pancho!

368
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:36,168
What did he say?

369
00:38:37,036 --> 00:38:39,556
Something about not understanding English.

370
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,877
He must not understand money either.

371
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,982
He didn't take his fare.

372
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,481
- Chuck, what do we do now?
- I don't know.

373
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,072
Let's get a drink.

374
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,810
All right.

375
00:39:03,797 --> 00:39:05,197
Wait a minute.

376
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,227
We should go back to the boat.

377
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:11,223
Always afraid in the heart?

378
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:38,411
Still scared?

379
00:39:51,983 --> 00:39:53,448
Perdón, señor.

380
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:57,346
Don't need any steam here.

381
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,900
To steam here.

382
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:24,243
Tell me again.

383
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:28,347
I love you, darling.
I love you.

384
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:33,513
Darling, I don't care what happens now.

385
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:35,952
I just don't care.

386
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:37,486
Laura, don't keep saying that.

387
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,593
Please don't keep saying it.

388
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:41,589
I won't.

389
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,070
I won't say it anymore.

390
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:46,340
Because I do care.

391
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:07,660
Lorna. Lorna, what's the matter?
Lorna!

392
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:12,840
Laura! Laura...

393
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:55,780
- Mark and scar?
- Knife wound. No other marks.

394
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,364
We're waiting, Mr. Scott.

395
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:10,582
Oh, can I make you understand
you've got the wrong man?

396
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:14,383
I loved her.

397
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:16,700
You loved her so you killed her.

398
00:44:17,452 --> 00:44:18,715
That's understandable.

399
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:21,375
She was all I had.

400
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,920
So you made sure no one
could take her from you.

401
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,079
Oh, you're blind.

402
00:44:26,933 --> 00:44:28,915
Why would we come all this way together?

403
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,560
I'll let you tell me why.

404
00:44:31,813 --> 00:44:33,556
Just answer three questions.

405
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,863
How long had this woman been in Havana?

406
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,040
Oh, we got off the boat...

407
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:44,826
around six o'clock this evening.

408
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:46,169
Eight hours ago.

409
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:48,973
Had she ever been here before?

410
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,885
No.

411
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,981
Did she know anyone here, anyone at all?

412
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
No.

413
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,536
There is your answer.

414
00:44:55,646 --> 00:44:57,586
Do you still insist somebody else did it?

415
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,380
In a place where she had just arrived?

416
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,758
In a place where she had
never been in her life before?

417
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,124
And above all, with your own knife?

418
00:45:04,495 --> 00:45:05,575
It wasn't my knife.

419
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,260
But you just admitted a
moment ago it was your knife.

420
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:08,596
I didn't admit it wasn't my knife.

421
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,342
I merely said it looked
like my knife, but it wasn't.

422
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:11,446
Oh, yeah.

423
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:12,933
Now I remember.

424
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:15,038
The knife you bought.

425
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:16,506
You did buy a knife.

426
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:18,086
Yes, I bought a knife!

427
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,640
Save your strength, my friend.

428
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,840
You may need it.

429
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:27,372
Your knife...

430
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:29,452
Let me see.

431
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,380
Describe it again, please.

432
00:45:37,005 --> 00:45:38,855
On the handle of the knife I had,

433
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,292
the bone-carved monkey
was holding his ears.

434
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:45,740
The knife you've got, he's
covering his eyes, you can see that.

435
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,046
He's covering his eyes, but not mine.

436
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,495
Don't joke!

437
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,216
If you don't believe
me, ask the shopkeeper.

438
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,107
Find out what kind of a knife I bought.

439
00:46:01,568 --> 00:46:03,386
Are you sure this is the place?

440
00:46:04,463 --> 00:46:05,772
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

441
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:09,158
I repeat, for a stranger in Havana,

442
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,485
you certainly found an out-of-the-way
place in a very much of a hurry.

443
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:13,976
We didn't find it.

444
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:16,263
I told you a guide brought us here.

445
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:17,276
I know.

446
00:46:17,396 --> 00:46:20,557
The guide who kept pestering you, the
one who drove you to the nightclub, huh?

447
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:22,605
You don't believe anything, do you?

448
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:26,450
My clients have a chronic tendency
to colour the truth.

449
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:31,649
You first, Mr. Scott.

450
00:46:39,436 --> 00:46:41,702
Just a moment, please.
Not so quick.

451
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,583
Where is Chin?

452
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:56,420
I am Chin.

453
00:46:57,537 --> 00:46:59,377
I'm Lieutenant Acosta, Homicide Squad.

454
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:04,595
What can I do for you?

455
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,894
- Madam, will you please tell the gent-
- We'll ask the questions.

456
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,900
Take a look at this man here.

457
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,582
Did you ever see him before?

458
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,700
Yes.

459
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,820
When?

460
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:21,146
The gentleman was here earlier tonight.

461
00:47:21,627 --> 00:47:22,407
Alone?

462
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,318
No, he was with a lady.

463
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,218
Did he buy anything?

464
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:29,612
Silk handkerchief for the lady.

465
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
That all?

466
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,364
The gentleman also bought a knife.

467
00:47:35,126 --> 00:47:36,361
What kind of knife?

468
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,481
A knife was a jade handle,

469
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,253
to cut lettuce, to cut fruit,

470
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,146
to hang on a wall, maybe.

471
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:45,372
Describe the Jade handle.

472
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:47,866
The Jade handle had a carved monkey.

473
00:47:48,093 --> 00:47:49,866
We know that. Describe the monkey.

474
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:52,046
Monkey was holding his eyes.

475
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,380
So.

476
00:47:55,393 --> 00:47:58,753
You're crazy. I bought the one
that was holding his ears!

477
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:01,622
The gentleman is mistaken.

478
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:04,893
Are you sure the one he
bought was holding its eyes?

479
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:07,234
They come three to a set.

480
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:09,221
First one is sold to this gentleman.

481
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,928
The others I still have.

482
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:12,555
I can show you.

483
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,306
Show me.

484
00:48:20,948 --> 00:48:22,613
These are imported from Hong Kong.

485
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:24,933
I only wanted one set.

486
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,824
Cost too much.

487
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,806
Never sold any except to this gentleman.

488
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
See?

489
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,640
Well, Mr. Scott?

490
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:44,972
I don't understand. I...

491
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:47,889
I'm sure I bought this one.

492
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:50,191
The one that's holding its ears.

493
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:52,483
- Why did you buy any knife?
- I didn't buy a knife.

494
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,009
I mean, I didn't intend
to buy a knife, but...

495
00:48:55,535 --> 00:48:58,910
but Lorna was looking for jade, and she said
the only jade she had was on the knife handles.

496
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:01,729
The one we finally bought was this one.

497
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,449
The one that's holding its ears.

498
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,441
Perhaps Madame Chin
switched the knives, huh?

499
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,267
She must have.

500
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:14,034
Did you ever see Chin before?

501
00:49:17,339 --> 00:49:17,839
No.

502
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:20,155
Then why would she change the knives?

503
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,170
Answer me!

504
00:49:36,626 --> 00:49:38,381
Why would she change the knives?

505
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,148
I don't know.

506
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:48,549
Because you are a stranger, and
only because you are a stranger,

507
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:51,483
we've given you every
chance to clear yourself.

508
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:55,396
You should have been locked up an hour ago.

509
00:49:57,136 --> 00:49:58,136
Admit it.

510
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,030
You know you killed her.

511
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,415
Admit it!

512
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,021
All right.

513
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,839
Then you did kill her.

514
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,053
Yes.

515
00:50:16,326 --> 00:50:18,213
Why, Mr. Scott?

516
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,011
Because she was afraid.

517
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,901
Because she wanted to go back.

518
00:50:27,926 --> 00:50:30,692
- Back? Where?
- To her husband.

519
00:50:30,973 --> 00:50:31,973
Her husband?

520
00:50:32,472 --> 00:50:33,852
Her name wasn't Mrs. Scott.

521
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:37,910
Her name was Mrs. Eddie Roman.

522
00:50:38,393 --> 00:50:40,578
We left Miami together
last night on the Cuba.

523
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,368
We docked here this morning.

524
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:44,015
Didn't leave our cabin
until it was dark.

525
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,600
Wound up in that nightclub.

526
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:49,995
We had a drink there.

527
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,776
Mr. Scott,

528
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:57,930
you are a gentleman.

529
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:03,426
Only from the viewpoint
of the police, of course.

530
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,980
Have a cigarette.

531
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:11,226
Pablo!

532
00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:08,025
Have you seen a man?

533
00:52:08,196 --> 00:52:10,396
Yes. He climbed up to the last floor.

534
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:11,503
Let's go!

535
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:12,712
After him.

536
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:13,737
All right, boss.

537
00:53:42,873 --> 00:53:44,202
Acosta!

538
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:47,853
He must be in the building.

539
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:48,991
There are no signs of him
downstairs.

540
00:53:49,105 --> 00:53:51,136
Could he have escaped
through the emergency exit?

541
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,616
We should search this room.

542
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,136
What's this room got
to do with this?

543
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:55,646
He must be in this building.

544
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:57,499
Let's look for him. He must be in here.

545
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,575
Open the door. It's the authorities.

546
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,027
Open the door!

547
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:11,494
Come on!

548
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,367
Get out of here! You have
no business here in my house.

549
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,456
If you don't shut up, I'll
take you to the police station.

550
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:20,145
He's not on this floor. Let's go.

551
00:54:20,397 --> 00:54:22,081
If he's in the building, we'll find him.

552
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:23,846
Sure. Let's go.

553
00:54:26,686 --> 00:54:27,686
Hurry!

554
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:36,973
Thanks a lot!

555
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:41,825
Say, you...

556
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,569
You never saw me before.

557
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:46,919
But you helped me.

558
00:54:47,512 --> 00:54:48,682
Why?

559
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,839
Cops.
I hate cops.

560
00:54:56,445 --> 00:54:57,825
Is there...

561
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,631
any other way out of here?

562
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:02,206
Only the way you came in.

563
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
Americano?

564
00:55:05,547 --> 00:55:06,547
Yeah.

565
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:08,261
Yeah, I'm an American.

566
00:55:09,147 --> 00:55:10,508
Miss, I just thought of something.

567
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:14,050
Do you know the man who takes these
pictures at the La Habana Cabino, who...

568
00:55:14,299 --> 00:55:16,039
flash-light photographs?

569
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,640
Not that it matters now, but...

570
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,961
I just thought that...
Maybe he did get something.

571
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:24,980
And if he did... It might...

572
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Pepe?

573
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Pepe?

574
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,886
Pepe!

575
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,535
No, no, no, no. No!

576
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:17,710
No.

577
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:21,230
We pay you the same
as we paid the last time.

578
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:22,883
And not one cent more.

579
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,179
Then perhaps I'll do business elsewhere.

580
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,776
Look, we run the stuff across, not you.

581
00:57:28,096 --> 00:57:30,524
What do you have to do?
Just wear out that seat.

582
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,230
Of course, that you do.

583
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,090
I don't mind assuming
the usual business risks.

584
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:36,890
But when it comes to knifing women...

585
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:39,746
Knifing women?
All you did was switch a couple of knives.

586
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:42,876
I had a visit from the police tonight.

587
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:45,752
They asked a lot of questions.

588
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,710
In our business, you can't
afford visits from the police.

589
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,454
No...

590
00:59:34,307 --> 00:59:36,100
but now I'm getting tired of this.

591
00:59:36,436 --> 00:59:37,436
For the last time.

592
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:41,093
The same stuff, the same
place, at the same price.

593
00:59:42,113 --> 00:59:43,157
No deal.

594
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,319
No?

595
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,549
Then you're out of business.

596
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,949
I don't think so.

597
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:50,628
No? Who's going
to buy your stuff?

598
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:51,821
You are.

599
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:53,693
Yeah? Why?

600
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:59,180
If you don't, certain people
may find out certain things,

601
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,100
which you might not want mentioned.

602
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,945
Sorry you said that.

603
01:00:05,299 --> 01:00:06,862
I'm sorry it had to be said.

604
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:49,100
<i>I could never make it alone.</i>

605
01:01:49,866 --> 01:01:51,606
<i>I could never make it alone.</i>

606
01:03:40,043 --> 01:03:41,996
U.S. Naval Hospital.

607
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:45,702
Commander Davidson, just a moment, please.

608
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:47,608
Commander Davidson's office.

609
01:03:48,436 --> 01:03:49,436
Who?

610
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,670
Oh, of course I remember you, Scott.

611
01:03:52,689 --> 01:03:53,689
Yes, he's here.

612
01:03:54,596 --> 01:03:56,500
Of course you may.
Just a minute.

613
01:04:02,145 --> 01:04:04,055
Chuck Scott would
like to speak to you, sir.

614
01:04:04,126 --> 01:04:04,668
Fine.

615
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:05,693
He's on the phone.

616
01:04:07,813 --> 01:04:08,813
Hello, Chuck.

617
01:04:09,206 --> 01:04:11,686
You said if I ever
needed you, I could call?

618
01:04:14,277 --> 01:04:15,648
Oh, I need you now.

619
01:04:17,073 --> 01:04:18,073
Yes, sir.

620
01:04:21,112 --> 01:04:22,690
Well, it's happened again.

621
01:04:23,853 --> 01:04:24,853
Yes, sir.

622
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,266
Yes, sir.

623
01:04:29,826 --> 01:04:31,986
I'll be there as soon as I can get there.

624
01:04:32,899 --> 01:04:33,899
Thanks.

625
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:40,625
<i>Take it easy, Chuck.</i>

626
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,408
<i>Now, let's try and
start with the beginning.</i>

627
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:49,331
Doesn't seem to be any beginning.

628
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:55,463
All I can remember is the...
the end of it.

629
01:05:04,636 --> 01:05:06,092
Sit down, Chuck.

630
01:05:13,696 --> 01:05:14,915
Yeah, but this outfit...

631
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,443
Where'd I get this uniform?

632
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,320
And the room I woke up in.

633
01:05:22,063 --> 01:05:23,606
How'd I get in that house?

634
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,465
Let's talk about what you remember.

635
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:28,938
Forget about the uniform.

636
01:05:29,895 --> 01:05:36,500
Well, yes, I was running away from the
police, in Havana, in the middle of the night.

637
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:40,926
But Chuck, you haven't been to Havana
in three or four years, to my knowledge.

638
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:42,920
So we can eliminate that.

639
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:44,258
That's dream stuff.

640
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,675
But the girl that you met
here in Miami, that's real.

641
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,429
The girl that you drove to the beach.

642
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,850
The one that wanted to know
what's out there straight ahead.

643
01:05:56,006 --> 01:05:57,006
That girl.

644
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:01,179
Yes.

645
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:05,249
But that's all I remember.

646
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:06,889
What she said.

647
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,763
But the beach, you said
you remembered the beach.

648
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,327
Yeah, the beach.

649
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,017
But that's all.

650
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:19,390
Why do you keep looking at the clock?

651
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:22,773
I don't know, Doc.

652
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:27,443
I keep feeling that there's
something that I've got to do.

653
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:29,915
Don't let that worry you.

654
01:06:30,423 --> 01:06:32,043
That's symptomatic in shock cases.

655
01:06:33,236 --> 01:06:34,916
But you did remember to call me.

656
01:06:35,436 --> 01:06:36,856
You did remember to come here.

657
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:39,706
You're pretty well out of it, Chuck.

658
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:45,270
- Yes, but I keep feeling that I...
<i>- I know.</i>

659
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:49,733
Technically, this would be identified,
in a case such as yours,

660
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,847
as an anxiety neurosis.

661
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,510
That sounds terrible, doesn't it?

662
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:56,356
But it's not, Chuck.

663
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,050
Believe me, it's not.

664
01:06:59,563 --> 01:07:00,563
You understand?

665
01:07:02,596 --> 01:07:03,596
Yes.

666
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,030
I still keep feeling that I've...

667
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:22,480
<i>I got the tickets for Havana,
and we'll meet at 11 o'clock tonight.</i>

668
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:23,888
<i>Now, listen carefully.</i>

669
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,621
<i>Have dinner with him as usual.</i>

670
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,352
<i>At 9:30, say you want to take a drive.</i>

671
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,012
<i>I'll be waiting in my room.</i>

672
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,480
<i>See you later.</i>

673
01:07:41,193 --> 01:07:42,600
Be happy, Lorna.

674
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:44,720
We're going to have fun tonight.

675
01:07:45,193 --> 01:07:46,370
I'm going to take you out.

676
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,080
We'll go to the Florida club.

677
01:07:49,036 --> 01:07:50,702
Or would you rather go for a ride?

678
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,122
Take a look at the ocean.

679
01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:57,165
Now, Scotty showed me your
rendez-vous this afternoon.

680
01:07:58,469 --> 01:07:59,859
Got a very nice view.

681
01:08:08,436 --> 01:08:10,234
You're very nervous this evening, Lorna.

682
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:11,666
What's the matter?

683
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,489
- Job!
- Yes, ma'am?

684
01:08:13,609 --> 01:08:16,209
Will you please tell Scotty
to bring the car around?

685
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,175
Scotty's gone.

686
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:24,510
- Gone?
- Yeah, quit.

687
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,660
He saw him leave.

688
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:28,233
He even yelled after him.

689
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,624
Didn't even turn around.

690
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:33,564
It's going to cost you 125
bucks for a new uniform.

691
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,100
- Still want to go for that ride?
- Thanks, no.

692
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:00,702
- Good evening, Commander.
- Good evening, Ben.

693
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:05,572
What'd you bring me here for, sir?

694
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,790
To buy you a drink.

695
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:09,531
- Still like bourbon?
- Yes, sir, anything.

696
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,825
Two bourbons and water, Ben.

697
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,850
Yes, sir.

698
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:14,904
A drink will do you a lot of good.

699
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,877
It'll help you let go, relieve the tension.

700
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:20,069
That's all you need, Chuck.

701
01:09:26,123 --> 01:09:28,633
Ben, turn the clock to the wall.

702
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,927
What's the idea?

703
01:09:30,663 --> 01:09:32,593
My friend is a clock watcher.

704
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,960
I don't understand you, Lorna.

705
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:00,979
I just don't understand you.

706
01:11:11,493 --> 01:11:12,843
Why don't you answer it?

707
01:11:13,943 --> 01:11:14,943
It might be Scotty.

708
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:17,449
It couldn't be Scotty.

709
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:20,086
How could it be Scotty?
Gino said that-

710
01:11:20,111 --> 01:11:21,227
Maybe he quit.

711
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,670
Maybe he didn't.

712
01:11:33,946 --> 01:11:35,006
Answer the phone.

713
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,630
Answer it.

714
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:44,783
Hello.

715
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,060
It's for you.

716
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,920
Yes.

717
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:58,813
Who wants to talk to him?

718
01:12:00,713 --> 01:12:02,740
The Fats. Yeah, I wanted to see you.

719
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,920
Talk to you about your place.

720
01:12:06,486 --> 01:12:08,906
I'll be right over, wait for me.

721
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:12,512
No, alone.

722
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,800
Been reading the paper, huh?

723
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:24,233
Mr. Johnson was an obstinate man.

724
01:13:26,267 --> 01:13:28,797
I don't like obstinate people.

725
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:33,803
Eddie.

726
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,619
Eddie...

727
01:13:47,579 --> 01:13:49,619
Can't we talk things over together,

728
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:52,651
like two civilized human beings?
All I want-

729
01:13:52,806 --> 01:13:53,515
I know.

730
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,652
All you want is to leave this house.

731
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:57,840
The way I came in.

732
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,458
I had nothing then, and...

733
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,160
I'm asking for nothing when I leave.

734
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,480
Just let me go.

735
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,440
Living in this house for three years, you...

736
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:14,960
must have found out a lot of things.

737
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,420
I wouldn't tell anyone.

738
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,010
Job!

739
01:14:29,216 --> 01:14:30,216
Please, Eddie.

740
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:33,203
Don't have him lock me in.

741
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:44,117
Job!

742
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,150
Job.

743
01:14:57,650 --> 01:14:59,293
<i>Keep this door locked, Job.</i>

744
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,546
<i>Mrs. Roman's not to leave
her room till I get back.</i>

745
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:03,312
<i>- Understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>

746
01:15:14,793 --> 01:15:15,893
Got it!

747
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:19,626
Her name was Lorna!

748
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,297
Lorna.

749
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:32,099
Lorna? What?

750
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,593
Lona what?

751
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:40,359
What was her name?

752
01:15:42,488 --> 01:15:43,396
Good evening, Mr. Roman.

753
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:44,561
Hello, Sally, how are you?

754
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:45,586
Fine, thank you.

755
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:48,310
- Hello, Albert.
- They've been waiting for you.

756
01:15:48,357 --> 01:15:49,480
Thank you, Mr. Roman.

757
01:15:49,993 --> 01:15:50,887
Good evening, Eddie.

758
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,134
Hi, Eddie!

759
01:15:58,986 --> 01:16:00,460
How is Mrs. Roman tonight?

760
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:01,780
Quite well, thank you, Albert.

761
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,925
She'll be joining you later?

762
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:03,950
No.

763
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:06,558
How about a little supper,
Mr. Roman?

764
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:09,110
No, I think I'd like
a bottle of wine.

765
01:16:09,336 --> 01:16:10,634
Launcente '28.

766
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:12,882
Yes, sir.

767
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:13,940
Launcente '28.

768
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:14,970
Yes, sir.

769
01:16:20,046 --> 01:16:22,106
Eddie, why don't you let
me have him picked up?

770
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,406
How far can he get in that uniform?

771
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:26,140
They'll grab him in a minute.

772
01:16:30,363 --> 01:16:32,000
Chuck, I've got to make
a phone call.

773
01:16:32,089 --> 01:16:33,089
Be back in a minute.

774
01:16:33,196 --> 01:16:34,196
Yes.

775
01:16:42,183 --> 01:16:43,183
Are you listening?

776
01:16:43,777 --> 01:16:45,777
Why don't you let me have him picked up?

777
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:50,290
What I want to know, I can't
ask him in the police station.

778
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,931
What do you think the deal was?

779
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,850
Eddie don't get mad, but
they had something cooked up.

780
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,670
What I can't get is the guy running out.

781
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:06,130
Maybe he didn't.

782
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,870
Look, Doc Davison.

783
01:17:19,353 --> 01:17:20,353
Hello?

784
01:17:21,926 --> 01:17:23,566
I'm still at the Florida club.

785
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:24,652
Yes, Fili.

786
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:26,700
Oh?

787
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:29,300
Well, I'll be back in about a half an hour.

788
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,140
Bye.

789
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:35,526
Oh, Doc!

790
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:39,846
Oh, hello, Roman.

791
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:44,395
Hello, Doc.

792
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:45,752
How are you, Doctor?

793
01:17:45,906 --> 01:17:47,625
- How's the Navy?
- Fine.

794
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,275
Commander, huh?

795
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,537
Look at all that spinach.

796
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:52,871
You've done all right for yourself.

797
01:17:53,272 --> 01:17:54,272
Not bad.

798
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:55,466
How's Mrs. Roman?

799
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,120
Fine, thanks.

800
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,574
Haven't seen you since you joined.

801
01:17:59,943 --> 01:18:01,673
Yes, it has been some time.

802
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:04,669
- Oh, won't you sit down and join us?
- No, thank you.

803
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:07,156
I have a friend waiting for me at the bar.

804
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:31,325
When are you getting out?

805
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:32,552
I may stay here.

806
01:18:32,597 --> 01:18:33,785
How do you like Sawyer?

807
01:18:34,596 --> 01:18:36,189
Turned your practice over
to a swell guy.

808
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,296
I like him very much.

809
01:18:37,656 --> 01:18:38,656
So does Lorna.

810
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,440
Lorna?

811
01:18:41,496 --> 01:18:42,496
<i>Lorna!</i>

812
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:45,057
Mrs. Roman.

813
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:48,150
Why, of course, it was silly of me.

814
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,991
Sure you won't join
us for that drink?

815
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:53,970
No, thank you. My
friend's still waiting for me.

816
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:56,359
Nice seeing you.
Remember me to your wife.

817
01:19:19,942 --> 01:19:21,808
- Hello, Job!
- Hello.

818
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:23,974
Keep away from that door.

819
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:26,249
Oh, yeah, that's right,
Job like in the Bible.

820
01:19:41,432 --> 01:19:42,765
Chuck...

821
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,340
Chuck...

822
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:52,649
I didn't think you were coming.

823
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,460
I didn't think you believed
any of the things I told you.

824
01:19:58,573 --> 01:19:59,913
I believed you.

825
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,247
Wanna buy your place, Fats.

826
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,427
Sure, I'd like to sell you the place,
Eddie, but, uh...

827
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,293
I don't like the way you buy.

828
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,112
Pardon me.

829
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,578
Will you OK this check?

830
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,497
Aren't you afraid you'll
miss your boat, Eddie?

831
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:29,232
What did you say, Fats?

832
01:20:29,435 --> 01:20:31,356
I said, aren't you afraid
you'll miss your boat?

833
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:33,399
What boat?

834
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,991
Aren't you leaving for Havana tonight?

835
01:20:37,626 --> 01:20:39,021
What are you talking about?

836
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:42,579
I swear I saw your car at
the docks this afternoon.

837
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:48,985
Okay, it's a secret. It's all right.

838
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,620
Start all over.

839
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,260
Only slower this time.

840
01:20:53,153 --> 01:20:56,193
I saw your chauffeur buy two tickets for...

841
01:20:58,426 --> 01:20:59,426
Skip it.

842
01:20:59,451 --> 01:21:00,871
I didn't see a thing.

843
01:21:01,759 --> 01:21:03,170
Gino, call the house.

844
01:21:27,753 --> 01:21:30,197
They're on the Cuba
they left 15 minutes ago.

845
01:21:30,457 --> 01:21:32,640
If they're on the Cuba
they left 15 minutes ago,

846
01:21:32,665 --> 01:21:34,295
but I don't think
they're on the Cuba.

847
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,054
Don't ask me why because I don't know,

848
01:21:36,269 --> 01:21:37,984
but I don't think they're on the Cuba.

849
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,960
If I'm not mistaken,
we'll find them on the...

850
01:21:43,053 --> 01:21:44,433
Yeah, here it is.

851
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:46,930
The Cristobal, freighter.

852
01:21:47,366 --> 01:21:50,266
He's pier 42, 11:30.

853
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:56,266
Watch the road. I'm taking over.

854
01:22:10,742 --> 01:22:12,144
What time are we shoving off?

855
01:22:12,463 --> 01:22:14,703
Great, they're loading.
Another hour, maybe two.

856
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,610
No, they're still loading.

857
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:18,571
We won't pull out of
here for another hour yet.

858
01:22:19,056 --> 01:22:20,697
I'll stay down at the pier till we leave.

859
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,250
Bad break.

860
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:25,307
Only two ships leaving for Havana tonight,
this and the Cuba.

861
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:51,563
Keep this door lock on.

862
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:47,059
- Who is it?
- Chuck.

863
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:55,476
I didn't think you'd ever get back.

864
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,190
Chuck, will this boat ever get started?

865
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:01,043
It doesn't matter now.

866
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:03,093
What do you mean?

867
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,002
Tell me again.

868
01:25:15,742 --> 01:25:17,069
I love you.

869
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:23,217
I want you to keep telling me
that as long as we're together.

870
01:25:26,676 --> 01:25:28,030
That'll be forever.
