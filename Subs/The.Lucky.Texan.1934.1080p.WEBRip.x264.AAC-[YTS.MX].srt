00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:40,275
Oh, so you wanna play, eh?

177
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:40,376
Say, Jake, take a look.

178
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:42,378
Say, Jake, take a look.

179
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,112
Say, Jake, take a look.

180
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,380
That's a piece of quartz that
came out of the horse's hoof.

181
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,647
That's a piece of quartz that
came out of the horse's hoof.

182
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:46,382
It's gold!

183
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:48,317
It's gold!

184
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:48,384
Say, there's a stringer in
there bigger than a ten-penny
nail.

185
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,386
Say, there's a stringer in
there bigger than a ten-penny
nail.

186
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,187
Say, there's a stringer in
there bigger than a ten-penny
nail.

187
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:52,388
If we only knew where it came
from.

188
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,956
If we only knew where it came
from.

189
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:54,390
I do know.

190
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,392
I do know.

191
00:05:56,392 --> 00:05:56,425
I do know.

192
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:57,860
That prospector said he was
forced down the middle of a
crick

193
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,394
12 miles out.

194
00:05:58,394 --> 00:05:59,561
12 miles out.

195
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,396
Well, there's only one crick
out there, Jerry.

196
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:01,463
Well, there's only one crick
out there, Jerry.

197
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:02,398
It'll be a cinch to backtrack
it.

198
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:03,665
It'll be a cinch to backtrack
it.

199
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:04,400
Well, we're on our way right
now, and if we find anything,

200
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,201
Well, we're on our way right
now, and if we find anything,

201
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:06,402
I know a dog that's gonna have

202
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,770
I know a dog that's gonna have

203
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,404
A porterhouse steak and a home
for life.

204
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,372
A porterhouse steak and a home
for life.

205
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:10,406
You said it!

206
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,408
You said it!

207
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:14,410
You said it!

208
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,412
You said it!

209
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,414
You said it!

210
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:20,282
You said it!

211
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,428
Right there's where he left
the crick.

212
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,430
Right there's where he left
the crick.

213
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,432
Right there's where he left
the crick.

214
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,434
Right there's where he left
the crick.

215
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:40,369
Right there's where he left
the crick.

216
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:14,470
Wait a minute. Look at that.

217
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,472
Wait a minute. Look at that.

218
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:17,239
Wait a minute. Look at that.

219
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,474
Say, that's the real stuff,
son.

220
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:19,608
Say, that's the real stuff,
son.

221
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:20,476
Accordin' to this sand, the
crick's full of color.

222
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,478
Accordin' to this sand, the
crick's full of color.

223

00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:29,485
Accordin' to this sand, the

227
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,494
Hello. Hello, Benson.

228
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:38,861
Hello. Hello, Benson.

229
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:39,962

First place, do you fellas buy

231
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:41,964
First place, do you fellas buy

232
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:42,498
Certainly. That's part of our
business.

233
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:43,765
Certainly. That's part of our
business.

234
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,500
Weigh this up and let's see
what we got.

235
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,502
Weigh this up and let's see
what we got.

00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:51,073
Weigh this up and let's see
what we got.

239
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:52,508
Say, that's the pure stuff.

240
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,510
Say, that's the pure stuff.

241
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:54,843
Say, that's the pure stuff.

242
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,512
It's as good as I've ever
seen.

243
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:58,514
It's as good as I've ever
seen.

244
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,516
It's as good as I've ever
seen.

245
00:08:00,516 --> 00:08:00,849
It's as good as I've ever
seen.

246
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,518
You've made a great strike
somewhere.

247
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,520
You've made a great strike
somewhere.

248
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,522
You've made a great strike
somewhere.

249
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:08,524
You've made a great strike
somewhere.

250
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,526
You've made a great strike
somewhere.

251
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:10,692
You've made a great strike
somewhere.

252
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,538
Let's see.

253
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:23,272
Let's see.

254
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:24,540
$16 an ounce...

255
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,542
$16 an ounce...

256
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:26,875
$16 an ounce...

257
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,544
That'll come to $848.

258
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,546
That'll come to $848.

259
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:30,879
That'll come to $848.

260
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,548
Okay, we'll take that in
currency

261
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:32,581
Okay, we'll take that in
currency

262
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,550
If it's just the same to you.

263
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,750
If it's just the same to you.

264
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,552
Okay. All right, Joe.

265
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:37,920
Okay. All right, Joe.

266
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,554
Now listen, we expect to bring
in many times that amount.

267
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:40,556
Now listen, we expect to bring
in many times that amount.

268
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:41,723
Now listen, we expect to bring
in many times that amount.

269
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:42,558
We think we've got a rich
strike.

270
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:43,692
We think we've got a rich
strike.

271
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:44,560
But we don't want anybody to
know anything about it.

272
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,562
But we don't want anybody to
know anything about it.

273
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:46,762
But we don't want anybody to
know anything about it.

274
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,263
You'll tell us, won't you?

275
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:48,564
We're not tellin' anybody,
Harris.

276
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:49,998
We're not tellin' anybody,
Harris.

277
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:50,566
But when we do get ready to
let the location be known,

278
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,568
But when we do get ready to
let the location be known,

279
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:52,801
But when we do get ready to
let the location be known,

280
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,570
You'll be the first ones in on
it.

281
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:54,736
You'll be the first ones in on
it.

282
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:55,470
Thanks.

283
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,572
Come on, Jake.

284
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:56,605
Come on, Jake.

285
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,574
We gotta go buy a dog a
porterhouse steak.

286
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,576
We gotta go buy a dog a
porterhouse steak.

287
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:00,842
We gotta go buy a dog a
porterhouse steak.

288
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:02,044
They made a rich strike,

289
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:02,578
And it's up to us to locate
it.

290
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,580
And it's up to us to locate
it.

291
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:04,713
And it's up to us to locate
it.

292
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:06,582
I wouldn't mind having old man
Benson's ranch, either.

293
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:08,584
I wouldn't mind having old man
Benson's ranch, either.

294
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,184
I wouldn't mind having old man
Benson's ranch, either.

295
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:10,586
He used to run cattle.

296
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:11,320
He used to run cattle.

297
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,588
Huh! Course, he doesn't know
it,

298
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:13,689
Huh! Course, he doesn't know
it,

299
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:14,590
But I got most of them.

300
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,592
But I got most of them.

301
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,594
But I got most of them.

302
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:20,596
But I got most of them.

303
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:22,598
But I got most of them.

304
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:23,599
But I got most of them.

305
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:41,984
Ya know, Jake, it's a good
thing

306
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:42,618
We didn't file on that claim.

307
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:44,620
We didn't file on that claim.

308
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,587
We didn't file on that claim.

309
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:46,622
It'd have tipped the whole
town off to the location

310
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:47,756
It'd have tipped the whole
town off to the location

311
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:48,624
And confined our operation.

312
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,626
And confined our operation.

313
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:50,759
And confined our operation.

314
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,394
As it is, we can work the
whole crick.

315
00:09:52,394 --> 00:09:52,628
Yeah. Your idea of crossin'
windy flats

316
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,630
Yeah. Your idea of crossin'
windy flats

317
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,764
Yeah. Your idea of crossin'
windy flats

318
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:56,632
And enterin' the town from the
other side

319
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:57,566
And enterin' the town from the
other side

320
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,634
Sure had 'em puzzled. Hah!

321
00:09:58,634 --> 00:09:59,768
Sure had 'em puzzled. Hah!

322
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:00,636
It sure has. They been
back-trailin' the trail

323
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,404
It sure has. They been
back-trailin' the trail

324
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:02,638
For two months,

325
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:03,672
For two months,

326
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:04,640
And they always get stuck at
windy flats.

327
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,241
And they always get stuck at
windy flats.

328
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:06,642
They think this mine's out in
the middle of the desert.

329
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,644
They think this mine's out in
the middle of the desert.

330
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:09,011
They think this mine's out in
the middle of the desert.

331
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,646
Supposin' we take a little
rest, huh?

332
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:12,648
Supposin' we take a little
rest, huh?

333
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:12,781
Supposin' we take a little
rest, huh?

334
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,982
Just a few more days

335
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:14,650
And Betty'll be comin'.

336
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,652
And Betty'll be comin'.

337
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:17,686
And Betty'll be comin'.

338
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:18,654
Don't you think we better be
gettin' back

339
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:19,221
Don't you think we better be
gettin' back

340
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,656
And gettin' some of this dirt
out of our hides?

341
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:21,089
And gettin' some of this dirt
out of our hides?

342
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:22,658
Yeah, I reckon you're right.

343
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:23,592
Yeah, I reckon you're right.

344
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:24,660
You know, you wanna sure look
your best.

345
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,662
You know, you wanna sure look

Better send for the doctor,
sheriff.

587

It's too late.

593
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,110
You've killed him, Jake.

594
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,112
You've killed him, Jake.

595
00:17:57,112 --> 00:17:57,512
You've killed him, Jake.

596
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,047
I killed him?!

597
00:17:59,047 --> 00:17:59,114
You're not trying to deny it,
are you?

598
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:00,849
You're not trying to deny it,
are you?

599
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:01,116
Didn't I hear you fighting?

600
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,317
Didn't I hear you fighting?

601
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,118
You were the only one in here,
Mr. Benson.

You were the only one in here,
Mr. Benson.

607
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,130
Somebody must've come in
through the back door.

608
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,030
Somebody must've come in
through the back door.

609
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,132
That's the only way it
could've happened.

610
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:17,866
That's the only way it
could've happened.

611
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:19,134
Don't worry, old timer.

612
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:19,634
Don't worry, old timer.

619
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:53,168
This is Mr. Benson's ranch,
isn't it?

620
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:55,103
This is Mr. Benson's ranch,

Why, yes. Are you Betty?

624
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,174
And you're Jerry Mason.

625
00:18:59,174 --> 00:18:59,841
And you're Jerry Mason.

626
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,176
Why didn't you let us know you
were coming today?

627
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:02,243
Why didn't you let us know you
were coming today?

628
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:03,178
I wanted to surprise Grandy.

629
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:04,679
I wanted to surprise Grandy.

630
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:05,180
Where is he?

631
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,514
Where is he?

632
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:07,182
Oh, uh...

633
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:08,950
Oh, uh...

634
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,184
Well, uh, you see,

635
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:10,518
Well, uh, you see,

636
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:11,186
When he gets out in the hills
prospecting,

637
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:12,253
When he gets out in the hills
prospecting,

638
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:13,188
Why, he...well, it's pretty
hard to tell when he is coming
back.

639
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:15,190
Why, he...well, it's pretty
hard to tell when he is coming
back.

640
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,192
Why, he...well, it's pretty

00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:23,898
Oh, gee, you don't know how
glad I am to be here.

647
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:25,200
I just can't wait to see
Grandy!

648
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,234
I just can't wait to see
Grandy!

649
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:27,202
I'm gonna ride out and see if
I can't locate him.

650
00:19:27,202 --> 00:19:28,570
I'm gonna ride out and see if
I can't locate him.

651
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,204

Got any news, Jerry?

671

This may not mean anything,

676
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:21,256
But Al the sheriff's son has
been flashin' a roll of bills.

677

But Al the sheriff's son has

Where'd you get that money,
Miller?

696
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:49,484
Where'd you get that money,
Miller?

697
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,286
I don't think that's any of
your business.

698
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:51,419
I don't think that's any of
your business.

699
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,288
I'm makin' it my business

700
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:53,621
I'm makin' it my business

701
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,290
Because that's part of the
money Jake Benson paid the
banker.

702
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:55,323
Because that's part of the
money Jake Benson paid the
banker.

703
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,858
Just where did you get it?

704
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:57,292
I told you before... it's none
of your business.

705
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,294
I told you before... it's none
of your business.

706

I told you before... it's none
of your business.

710
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:41,396
Tell these boys where you got
that money.

711
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:41,662
Tell these boys where you got
that money.

712
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:43,030
None of your business!

713
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:43,398
Oh, no?

714
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:44,766
Oh, no?

00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:45,400
I did it, I did it!

716
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,367
I did it, I did it!

717
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:47,402
Let me go!

718
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:47,869
Let me go!

719
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,370

729
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,550
I tell you, sheriff, Jake is
innocent.

730
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,517
I tell you, sheriff, Jake is
innocent.

731

( All agreeing )

733
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,554
Wait a minute then.

734
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:19,987
Wait a minute then.

735
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,556
If what you say is true

736
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:21,756
If what you say is true

737
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:23,558
And my boy is guilty of this
crime,

00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:24,225
And my boy is guilty of this
crime,

Well, son, we won't be workin'

Well, son, we won't be workin'

Till next spring.

829
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:45,700
We can't afford to miss meals
like this.

830
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,702
We can't afford to miss meals
like this.

831
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:48,302
We can't afford to miss meals
like this.

832
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:49,704
I think I'll go out tomorrow
and hide the sluice box.

833
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:51,706
I think I'll go out tomorrow
and hide the sluice box.

834
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:53,708
In fact, I'll stake out three
claims along the crick

835
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:54,075
In fact, I'll stake out three
claims along the crick

836
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:55,710
And you can file on 'em.

837
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,077
And you can file on 'em.

838
00:27:56,077 --> 00:27:57,712
After all, you know, better be

While you're gone, I'll take
Betty around the ranch

845
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:05,720
And you can figure on me bein'

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,388
And you can figure on me bein'
here for dinner.

847
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:07,722
All right, Grandy.

848

All right, Grandy.

849
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:10,825
All right, Grandy.

850
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:11,726
This town is located about six
miles off that spur.

851
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:13,728
This town is located about six
miles off that spur.

00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:23,738
Pardon me a moment, Betty.

860

Pardon me a moment, Betty.

865
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,748
You know they're takin' young
Miller over to Cedar City?

866
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:34,448
You know they're takin' young
Miller over to Cedar City?

867
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:35,750
Is that so?

868
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:35,783
Is that so?

869
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,384
I thought you might like to
know

870
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:37,752
That banker Williams is gonna

00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,168
What's the matter, old timer?

1052
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:34,468
What's the matter, old timer?

1053
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,802
Are you all right?

1054
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:36,170
I'm only a little dizzy.

1055
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,171
I'm only a little dizzy.

1056
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:38,172
I'm gettin' better every
minute.

1057
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:38,772
I'm gettin' better every
minute.

1058
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:40,073
They only nicked me.

1059
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:40,174
What are you talkin' about?
Who nicked you?

1060
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:42,176
What are you talkin' about?
Who nicked you?

1061
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:42,809
What are you talkin' about?
Who nicked you?

1062
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,178

00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:45,112
I'll tell you all about it on
the way home.

1064
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,180

00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:55,022
Come on.

1070
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:58,192
Remember now, son, not a word
to Betty.

1071
00:35:58,192 --> 00:36:00,194
Remember now, son, not a word
to Betty.

1072
00:36:00,194 --> 00:36:02,196
Remember now, son, not a word
to Betty.

1073
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:04,198
Remember now, son, not a word
to Betty.

1074
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:06,200
Remember now, son, not a word
to Betty.

1075
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,334
Remember now, son, not a word
to Betty.

1076
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:12,206
What happened, Grandy?

1077
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:13,840
What happened, Grandy?

1078
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,208
Oh, you're hurt!

1079
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,175
Oh, you're hurt!

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,277
No, tain't nothin' at all.

1082
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,212
Horse throwed me and hit
square on my head.

1083
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,346
Horse throwed me and hit
square on my head.

1084
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:20,214
What I need is a good feed.

1085
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:21,548
What I need is a good feed.

1086
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:22,216
I'll run right uptown and get

1088
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:24,418
I'll run right uptown and get
you something nice then.

1089
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,220
Don't tell anyone that your
granddad is here.

1090
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,588
Don't tell anyone that your
granddad is here.

Oh, that's just a souvenir of

1112
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:55,916
Oh, that's just a souvenir of
my old theatrical days.

1113
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:56,250
I didn't know you were an
actor, Jake.

1114
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,985
I didn't know you were an
actor, Jake.

1115
00:36:57,985 --> 00:36:58,252
Yep. I wore that when I played

Oh! ( Knock on door )

1141
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:32,286
Hello, Mason.

1142
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:33,320
Hello, Mason.

1143
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,288
Has Benson come in yet?

1144
00:37:34,288 --> 00:37:35,455
Has Benson come in yet?

1145
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:36,290
Not yet.

1146
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,224
Not yet.

1147
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:38,292
If he doesn't get in by night,

1148
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:40,294
I'm goin' lookin' for him.

1149
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:40,427
I'm goin' lookin' for him.

1150
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,262
I reckon his horse threw him.

1151
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:42,296
We just called to find out

1152
00:37:42,296 --> 00:37:43,430
We just called to find out

1153
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,298
When we could take possession
of this ranch.

1154
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:46,300
When we could take possession
of this ranch.

1155
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,333
When we could take possession
of this ranch.

1156
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,201
Take possession?

1157
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:48,302
I don't understand.

1158
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,170
I don't understand.

1159
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:50,304
Well, maybe Benson didn't tell
you,

1160
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:52,139
Well, maybe Benson didn't tell
you,

1161
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:52,306
But we bought this ranch a few
days ago.

1162
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,308
But we bought this ranch a few
days ago.

1163
00:37:54,308 --> 00:37:55,776
But we bought this ranch a few
days ago.

1164
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:56,310
That's strange.

1165
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,311
That's strange.

1166
00:37:57,311 --> 00:37:58,312
Funny he didn't tell me.

1167
00:37:58,312 --> 00:37:59,246
Funny he didn't tell me.

1168
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:00,314
You got a bill of sale?

1169
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:01,214
You got a bill of sale?

1170
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:02,115
Why, certainly.

1171
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:02,316
It's at the office.

1172
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,884
It's at the office.

1173
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:04,318
Then I'll have Jake drop in
tomorrow

1174
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:05,686
Then I'll have Jake drop in
tomorrow

1175
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:06,320
And he can advise you when
he's gettin' out.

1176
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,322
And he can advise you when
he's gettin' out.

1177
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:08,555
And he can advise you when
he's gettin' out.

1178
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:09,589
That'll be fine.

1179
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:10,324
We're anxious to get started
on

1180
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:10,891
We're anxious to get started
on

1181
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,326
The improvements on the place.

1182
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,328
The improvements on the place.

1183
00:38:14,328 --> 00:38:16,330
The improvements on the place.

1184
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,332
The improvements on the place.

1185
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:20,334
The improvements on the place.

1186
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:20,834
The improvements on the place.

1187
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:26,340
What are they talking about?

1188
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:26,940
What are they talking about?

1189
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,342
I ain't sold no ranch.

1190
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:30,344
Have you signed any papers
lately, Jake?

1191
00:38:30,344 --> 00:38:30,377
Have you signed any papers
lately, Jake?

1192
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,346
No. I don't think so...

1193
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:32,846
No. I don't think so...

1194
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:33,513
Wait a minute.

1195
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:34,348
Yes, I did.

1196
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:35,482
Yes, I did.

1197
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,350
I signed a receipt for the
money we got from them last
nuggets.

1198
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,384
I signed a receipt for the
money we got from them last
nuggets.

1199
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:38,352
Did you look at it closely?

1200
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:38,652
Did you look at it closely?

1201
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:39,786
No.

1202
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:40,354
That's it then.

1203
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,588
That's it then.

1204
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:42,356
You probably signed a bill of
sale for the ranch.

1205
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:42,956
You probably signed a bill of
sale for the ranch.

1206
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:44,358
That's why they were tryin' to
get rid of you.

1207
00:38:44,358 --> 00:38:45,092
That's why they were tryin' to
get rid of you.

1208
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:46,360
They figured they could claim
the ranch then and nobody could
deny it.

1209
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,994
They figured they could claim
the ranch then and nobody could
deny it.

1210
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:48,362
Them dirty, lowdown polecats.

1211
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:50,364
Them dirty, lowdown polecats.

1212
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:50,897
Them dirty, lowdown polecats.

1213
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:52,065
We'll get 'em.

1214
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:52,366
You wait till my headache's
better tomorrow.

1215
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:54,368
You wait till my headache's
better tomorrow.

1216
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:54,468
You wait till my headache's
better tomorrow.

1217
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:56,370
We'll give them the surprise
of their life.

1218
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:56,503
We'll give them the surprise
of their life.

1219
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:58,372
Say, but you better go file on
them claims.

1220
00:38:58,372 --> 00:38:58,972
Say, but you better go file on
them claims.

1221
00:38:58,972 --> 00:39:00,374
Take that canteen of nuggets

1222
00:39:00,374 --> 00:39:00,674
Take that canteen of nuggets

1223
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,376
And leave it at the bank this
time.

Here's the location of them
three claims.

1230
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:14,988
Here's the location of them
three claims.

1231
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:16,390
There's one for Betty, one for
you, and one for me.

1232
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,225
There's one for Betty, one for
you, and one for me.

1233
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:18,392
All right. You better lie down
and get some sleep, Jake.

1234
00:39:18,392 --> 00:39:20,394
All right. You better lie down
and get some sleep, Jake.

1235
00:39:20,394 --> 00:39:21,161
All right. You better lie down
and get some sleep, Jake.

1236
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:22,396
Don't you forget yourself.

1237
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:22,863
Don't you forget yourself.

1238
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,398
Remember, I'm supposed to be
dead.

1239
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:24,464
Remember, I'm supposed to be
dead.

00:39:24,464 --> 00:39:26,400
Oh, I ain't forgettin'.

There's Mason.

1250
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:08,442
Isn't that old Jake's canteen
on the saddle?

1251
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:10,444
Isn't that old Jake's canteen
on the saddle?

1252
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:11,378
Isn't that old Jake's canteen
on the saddle?

1253
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:12,446
Let's go see.

1254
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:14,448
Let's go see.

1255
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:16,450
Let's go see.

1256
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,452
Let's go see.

1257
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:20,454
Let's go see.

00:40:20,454 --> 00:40:21,288
Let's go see.

1259
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:30,464
He must've taken it off the
burro before we got there.

1260
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,466
He must've taken it off the
burro before we got there.

1261
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,468
He must've taken it off the
burro before we got there.

1262
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:36,470
He must've taken it off the
burro before we got there.

1263
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,472
He must've taken it off the
burro before we got there.

1264
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:39,639
He must've taken it off the
burro before we got there.

1265
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,486
What have you got there, boys?

1266
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:54,020
Oh, hello, hello.

1267
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,488
I...uh...

1268
00:40:54,488 --> 00:40:55,922
I...uh...

1269
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:56,490
You see, sheriff, we
recognized this canteen.

1270
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,257
You see, sheriff, we
recognized this canteen.

1271
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:58,492
It belongs to old Jake Benson.

1272
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:00,494
It belongs to old Jake Benson.

1273
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:00,827
It belongs to old Jake Benson.

1274
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:02,429
Whenever Jake brought in his
nuggets to us,

1275
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:02,496
Unknown to anyone else, he
brought them in this canteen.

1276
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:04,498
Unknown to anyone else, he
brought them in this canteen.

1277
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:05,799
Unknown to anyone else, he
brought them in this canteen.

1278
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:06,500
We thought it was kinda funny
that old Jake's disappeared

1279
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,502
We thought it was kinda funny
that old Jake's disappeared

1280
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:09,569
We thought it was kinda funny
that old Jake's disappeared

1281
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:10,504
And Mason should have this.

1282
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,472
And Mason should have this.

1283
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:12,506
Where is Mason?

1284
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:13,573
Where is Mason?

1285
00:41:13,573 --> 00:41:14,508
He went in the courthouse.

1286
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:15,675
He went in the courthouse.

1287
00:41:15,675 --> 00:41:16,510
Pete, go in there and see what
Mason's doing.

1288
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,512
Pete, go in there and see what
Mason's doing.

1289
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:18,845
Pete, go in there and see what
Mason's doing.

1290
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:20,514
I reckon he can explain this.

1291
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:22,516
I reckon he can explain this.

1292
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:24,518
I reckon he can explain this.

1293
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:26,520
I reckon he can explain this.

1294
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,522
I reckon he can explain this.

1295
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:28,655
I reckon he can explain this.

1296
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:38,532
He's filing on a mining claim,
sheriff.

1297
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:39,432
He's filing on a mining claim,
sheriff.

1298
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:40,534
Probably old Jake's claim.

1299
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:42,536
Probably old Jake's claim.

1300
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:43,403
Probably old Jake's claim.

1301
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:44,538
Well, we'll just wait till he
gets here.

1302
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:46,540
Well, we'll just wait till he
gets here.

1303
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,542
Well, we'll just wait till he
gets here.

1304
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,544
Well, we'll just wait till he
gets here.

1305
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:52,546
Well, we'll just wait till he
gets here.

1306
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:53,146
Well, we'll just wait till he
gets here.

1307
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:54,548
Howdy, boys.

1308
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:55,815
Howdy, boys.

1309
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:56,550
What's all the powwow about?

1310
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,150
What's all the powwow about?

1311
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,552
Just how did you come to have
this canteen of nuggets?

1312
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:00,554
Just how did you come to have
this canteen of nuggets?

1313
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:00,654
Just how did you come to have
this canteen of nuggets?

1314
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:02,556
I don't care to answer that
question, Harris.

1315
00:42:02,556 --> 00:42:03,723
I don't care to answer that
question, Harris.

1316
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:04,558
Whose claim were you just
filing on, Mason?

1317
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,560
Whose claim were you just
filing on, Mason?

1318
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,860
Whose claim were you just
filing on, Mason?

1319
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,562
My own claim.

1320
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:09,296
My own claim.

1321
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:10,564
Do you know anything about
Jake Benson's disappearance?

1322
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:11,565
Do you know anything about
Jake Benson's disappearance?

1323
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:12,566
Yes, I know he hasn't come
back.

1324
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:14,568
Yes, I know he hasn't come
back.

1325
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:14,634
Yes, I know he hasn't come
back.

1326
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,269
I'm sorry, Mason, but I'll
have to hold you

1327
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:16,570
Until we can locate Jake.

1328
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,572
Until we can locate Jake.

1329
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:19,506
Until we can locate Jake.

1330
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:20,574
That's fair enough.

1331
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:20,907
That's fair enough.

1332
00:42:20,907 --> 00:42:22,576
When do I get my preliminary
hearing?

1333
00:42:22,576 --> 00:42:23,476

First thing tomorrow morning.

1336

Mason's up for murder.

1357

1358
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:00,614

Come on, Benson!

1575
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,986
How do you run this thing?

1576
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:14,220
How do you run this thing?

1577
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:14,988
I'll do the driving.

1583
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:47,260
All right now, folks. That
looks fine.

1584
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,828
All right now, folks. That
looks fine.

1585
00:53:48,828 --> 00:53:49,262
Just a minute. Relax a minute.

1586

Here we go.

1588
00:53:51,264 --> 00:53:52,665
Here we go.

1589
00:53:52,665 --> 00:53:53,266
You must remember that I spent
most all of the afternoon

1590
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,268
You must remember that I spent
most all of the afternoon

1591

Trying to get you in position.

Now hold it just like that.

1595
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:00,640
Now hold it just like that.

1596
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,274
Hold her, hold it.

1597
00:54:01,274 --> 00:54:01,841
Hold her, hold it.

1598
00:54:01,841 --> 00:54:03,276
Hold it!
