3
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:21,903
Good evening, Evans.

4
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,915
Evening, sir.

5
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,370
Dinner is served, Mr. Kessler.

6
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:30,875
Thank you.

7
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,345
Good evening, my dear.

8
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,057
You're more beautiful
than ever this evening.

9
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,812
Mrs. Kessler first, Evans.

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,400
Oh yes, sir.

11
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:53,404
I'm sorry, sir.

12
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,596
Evans, how's dad taking it?

13
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,064
Alright, miss Virginia.

14
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,399
They're having dinner.

15
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,565
I'll answer it.

16
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,621
Hello, Virginia.

17
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,912
I told you not to come
here this evening, Ralph.

18
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,909
Why?

19
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,286
Didn't you want to see me?

20
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,538
Well, it isn't that I
didn't want to see you.

21
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,798
You're certainly acting
strange, darling.

22
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,384
What's all the mystery about?

23
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,128
Let's go into the library.

24
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,397
Ralph!

25
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,027
After dinner we are
taking a long walk.

26
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,365
I'd like to speak to you, Ralph.

27
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,957
What's come over your
father, Virginia?

28
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,292
Is that why you didn't
want me here tonight?

29
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,159
Yes.

30
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,457
It stopped me cold.

31
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,706
I'm sorry if I accidentally
stumbled on something you

32
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,628
didn't want me to know.

33
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,591
Well, it must seem weird to
someone who's

34
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,051
never seen it before.

35
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,386
It happens once a year.

36
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,301
He always appeared
perfectly rational to me.

37
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,466
Well, there's something
I must tell you.

38
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,059
It's about my mother.

39
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,520
I don't understand.

40
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,810
Well, it happened
several years ago.

41
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,150
My father and mother were
apparently as happy as two

42
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,360
people could be.

43
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,648
He worshipped her.

44
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,521
Another man?

45
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,524
The usual best friend.

46
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,652
They almost broke
my father's heart.

47
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,121
He seemed reconciled, but he
never forgets their wedding

48
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,787
anniversary and
celebrates it that way.

49
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,331
I guess he isn't the only one
who resorts to make believe.

50
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,375
But it does give one
an uncanny feeling.

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,125
Well, it doesn't
frighten me anymore.

52
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,843
Now that you know.

53
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:28,893
I love you.

54
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,692
You wanted your
coat, miss Kessler?

55
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,731
Oh.

56
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,229
Oh yes, thank you.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,198
I was going to take a drive,
it's such a beautiful night.

58
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:45,691
Come along?

59
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,942
Yes, of course.

60
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,784
Sure you don't mind going?

61
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,949
No, no, I'd love it.

62
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,537
We'll be back in
an hour, cecile.

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,541
Yes, miss.

64
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:06,254
Hums

65
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,846
that's a nice young
man of miss Virginia's.

66
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,340
I guess so.

67
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:13,014
If he wasn't, miss Virginia
wouldn't bother with him.

68
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,727
Does she plan to marry him?

69
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,564
I never discuss things
that aren't my business.

70
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,728
If you want to stay here,

71
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,522
I suggest you don't
be so curious.

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,896
Well, just the same, I think
this is a crazy house.

73
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,397
And what about those murders?

74
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,740
Jules here says there's
been a lot of them.

75
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,531
And nobody's ever been able to
find out who did the killing.

76
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,699
You talk too much, Jules.

77
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,866
But I only said that...

78
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,954
Excuse me, miss cecile.

79
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,075
I'm going to show you
where we keep our linens.

80
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,245
Mrs. Kessler?

81
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,867
Oh Mrs. Kessler?

82
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,085
I brought you a dinner.

83
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,546
Oh please, Mrs. Kessler,
I got to go home.

84
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,717
Home?

85
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,837
I want to go home, too.

86
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,384
But you are home.

87
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,847
And as soon as you feel better,

88
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,183
I'm going to take you to
your husband and daughter.

89
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,769
But they never write to me.

90
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,480
Oh, but they don't know
where you are, Mrs. Kessler.

91
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,566
Nobody knows that but me.

92
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,900
You see, I found you.

93
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,019
I'm running away.

94
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,737
Running away in a car.

95
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,574
We're going faster,
faster, faster.

96
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,901
We're going to crash!

97
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,375
I can't go home now, can I?

98
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,546
Mrs. Kessler, please.

99
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,967
Please eat your dinner.

100
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,432
I've got to go home.

101
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,016
I'll be back in the morning.

102
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,760
Good night, Mrs. Kessler.

103
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,012
Good night.

104
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:09,902
You're late again, Jules.

105
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,272
I'm sorry, mama.

106
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,571
But I just couldn't
get away from her.

107
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:20,789
Jules, why don't you tell
Mr. Kessler about his wife,

108
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,781
that you're hiding her?

109
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,034
Oh, I haven't got
the heart, mama.

110
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,206
It would kill him if he
saw her the way she is.

111
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,545
Poor thing.

112
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,915
She'd be better off if she'd
died with that man when the

113
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,166
car was wrecked.

114
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,542
I guess so.

115
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,009
Jules, I've been thinking.

116
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,850
Maybe she had something
to do with all these

117
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,933
horrible murders.

118
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,100
Oh, ho, ho, she
wouldn't hurt nobody.

119
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,688
She's like a child.

120
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,933
She's still dazed
from the accident.

121
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,935
You know, amnesia.

122
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,983
She'll be better soon,
then I'll take her home.

123
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,785
But if they found out
I've been hiding her,

124
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,126
they might think I had something
to do with the murder.

125
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,212
Jules, you must
tell Mr. Kessler.

126
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,295
Oh, no, no, mama.

127
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,417
We must never tell anyone.

128
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,510
Never.

129
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,392
Sure you won't come in?

130
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,189
No thanks, darling, I
think I better run along.

131
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,197
Good night, Ralph.

132
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,694
Oh, Virginia?

133
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,736
Shall I put your car away?

134
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,403
No thanks.

135
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,321
Evans will take care of it.

136
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:39,909
Alright.

137
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,913
'Night.

138
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,539
Good evening, miss Virginia.

139
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,373
Would you please put
my car in the garage

140
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,708
when you have a moment?
Yes, miss.

141
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,433
Hello, Casanova.

142
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,732
Have you gone crazy?

143
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,858
The only chance
I had to see you.

144
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,652
You ignored my letters
and my telephone calls.

145
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,946
Did you think that you
could get rid of me

146
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,864
as easy as all that?

147
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,451
Be quiet.

148
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,285
They'll hear you.

149
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,278
You bet they will.

150
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,746
And you're going to
listen to me, too.

151
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,913
I'm not giving up for that
Kessler girl or anybody else.

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,330
This is different, cecile.

153
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,203
I never said I loved you.

154
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,082
Are you in love with her?

155
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:35,582
Yes.

156
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,379
Well, you're not
marrying her, understand?

157
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,048
Nothing's going to stand
in the way of my happiness.

158
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,591
Not even you.

159
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,594
Don't threaten me.

160
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,598
She'll have to know
about us sooner or later.

161
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,693
And besides, I'll make
you a good wife, Ralph.

162
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,903
I promise I will.

163
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,080
Guess what?

164
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,793
What?

165
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,877
I'm in love.

166
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,497
With Ralph?

167
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,338
Yes, dad.

168
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,628
He's a fine boy.

169
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,797
I'm so happy for you, my dear.

170
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,966
Oh, he hasn't asked me to
marry him yet, but he will.

171
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,884
I know he will.

172
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,803
Good night, my pet.

173
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,890
Good night too.

174
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,101
Good night, Evans.

175
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,435
Good night, miss Virginia.

176
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,102
Can I do anything for
you, sir, before I retire?

177
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,474
What happened to
your hand, Evans?

178
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,725
Oh, nothing, sir.

179
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,352
I hurt it when I was putting

180
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,853
miss Virginia's
car in the garage.

181
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,650
Put anything on it?

182
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,772
Oh, the bandage.

183
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,739
Oh, you may have an infection.

184
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:46,577
How's that?

185
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,162
Just like new, sir.

186
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,031
I guess I'll read for a while.

187
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,533
Good night, Evans.

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,624
Good night, sir.

189
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,672
Oh yes, Evans.

190
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,547
Thank you for the dinner.

191
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,462
Yes, sir.

192
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,090
I'm afraid to come home.

193
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,627
You'd kill me.

194
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,351
You'd kill anybody.

195
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,159
Why Mr. Kessler.

196
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,928
Aah!

197
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Woman screams

198
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,742
Exercise number one.

199
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,663
Arms at the sides.

200
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,127
At the count of one, four times.

201
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,371
Cecile?

202
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,792
One the chest.

203
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,884
At the count of two, move
your arms above your head.

204
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,721
At the count of three,
lower arms sideways.

205
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,214
If it's exercise you want,

206
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,807
there's plenty of
it in the kitchen.

207
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,224
At the count of four, lower
the arms

208
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,438
cecile!

209
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,146
And straight.

210
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,981
Arms at sides.

211
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,976
Ready, begin.

212
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,947
One, up, up, down,
one, up, up, down.

213
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:20,196
One, two, three, four, one,
two, three, four, one, two,

214
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,571
three, four.

215
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,789
Up, up, up.

216
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,793
One, two.

217
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,002
Mr. Kessler.

218
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,795
Yes?

219
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,294
Something terrible has happened.

220
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,011
I tried to wake the new maid.

221
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,880
I think she's dead.

222
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,349
Dead?

223
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,514
How did it happen?

224
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,511
I don't know, sir.

225
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,479
I thought she was
taking her exercises.

226
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,098
Call the police.

227
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,020
I'll see what I can do.

228
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,027
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,483
Well, Mr. Kessler, we're up
to our ears in another one.

230
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,030
The girl was killed the same way

231
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,777
as the chauffeur six months ago.

232
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,780
Only thing we could
find was this note,

233
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,282
left by some fellow who
wanted to give her the air.

234
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,784
It's terrible, lieutenant.

235
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,252
She was so young.

236
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,497
If we could find out
who killed cecile,

237
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,590
we have the one who committed
all the other murders.

238
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,050
That's easier said than done.

239
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,918
There's never been fingerprints,

240
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,170
to say nothing of motives.

241
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,264
What gets me, Mr. Kessler,
is why you refuse

242
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,678
to move out of this place.

243
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,428
Sentimental reasons.

244
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,350
There's nothing very
sentimental about a house

245
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,393
where anything could
happen and usually does.

246
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,187
My mother lived
here, lieutenant.

247
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,526
I see.

248
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,523
You're the gardener?

249
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,899
Yes, but I wasn't here.

250
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,945
I went home early.

251
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,988
See, I live with my wife.

252
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:42,826
Alright, alright, alright.

253
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,697
And please don't try to see me.

254
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,448
Signed, Ralph.

255
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,165
Ralph?

256
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,579
Do you know him?

257
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,248
Oh, I'm certain I don't.

258
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,836
The name startled me.

259
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,957
I'm practically
engaged to a Ralph.

260
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,257
Did you notice anything
unusual last night, Evans?

261
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,848
Well, maybe I better not say.

262
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,387
Let's have it, Evans.

263
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,885
When I was putting the
roadster in the garage,

264
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,388
I saw cecile talk
to Mr. dickson.

265
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,266
That's miss Virginia's Ralph.

266
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,733
Go on.

267
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,945
I didn't mean to listen,
but they were talking loud.

268
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,736
Then I heard him say
that he never loved her.

269
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,656
She said she wouldn't let
him marry anyone else.

270
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,452
That made him real mad, and
said nothing was going to

271
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:29,869
stand between him
and his happiness.

272
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,993
Not even her.

273
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,932
I knew cecile a couple of years.

274
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,976
She offered me the
companionship I needed.

275
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:57,727
Then I met you and fell in
love for the first time.

276
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,694
I love you too, Ralph.

277
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,735
Surely you can account for
your activities from the time

278
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,154
you left our house
until the next morning.

279
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,493
No, Mr. Kessler.

280
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,954
I had a lot to think about.

281
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,789
I took a long ride
into the country,

282
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,079
didn't stop anywhere and
didn't see a soul I knew.

283
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,668
That's most unfortunate.

284
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,791
All I know is that
I, I didn't kill her.

285
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,134
There isn't any doubt
about that in our minds.

286
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,049
Don't worry, son.

287
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,637
We'll do everything
we possibly can.

288
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,138
Order.

289
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,727
Order in the courtroom.

290
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,596
You solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

291
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,017
and nothing but the truth?

292
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,105
I do.

293
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,028
Yes, I manage the apartments
where Ralph dickson lived.

294
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,113
Miss mannix came there often.

295
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,195
As a matter of fact, I
thought they were married.

296
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,658
I went home early and helped

297
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,623
my wife with the house cleaning.

298
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,834
The coroner's testimony
should convince you that

299
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,499
the defendant had
sufficient reason

300
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,916
for wanting to be
rid of the victim.

301
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,039
It's the truth.

302
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,042
Said he wouldn't let nothing
stand in the way of his

303
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,294
happiness, not even her.

304
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,442
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

305
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,860
Tomorrow we're going
to see the governor.

306
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,029
Oh, and I'm sure
something can be done.

307
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,446
But governor, the
man is innocent.

308
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,870
If you would only Grant
a stay of execution.

309
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,208
If you knew him,

310
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,248
you'd realize he couldn't
possibly be a murderer.

311
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,791
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,256
I've gone over the
facts in the case,

313
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,841
and unless you can
present some new evidence,

314
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,335
there's nothing I can do.

315
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,143
The lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.

316
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,855
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

317
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,147
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

318
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,442
He restoreth my soul.

319
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,528
He leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness,

320
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,618
for his namesake.

321
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:14,990
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

322
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,241
I will fear no evil.

323
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,244
For thou art with me.

324
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,918
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

325
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,083
Thou prepareth a table

326
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,632
before me in the
presence of mine enemy.

327
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,718
Thou anointest my head with oil.

328
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,011
My cup runneth over.

329
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,058
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days

330
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,727
of my life, and I will dwell

331
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,273
in the house of
the lord forever.

332
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,121
Yes?

333
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,541
I see.

334
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,704
It's all over.

335
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,437
My name is dickson.

336
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:24,650
Yes. Of course.

337
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,268
I'd like to see Mr. Kessler.

338
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,446
He's in there.

339
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,076
I hope I'm not intruding.

340
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,999
Oh Ralph!

341
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,623
It can't be.

342
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,001
Apparently my brother
never told you about me.

343
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,343
Come in.

344
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:52,678
I've been in south America.

345
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,012
I flew here at once.

346
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,847
However, I'm afraid it's
too late to do any good.

347
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,342
So you're Ralph's brother.

348
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:03,064
I knew about you,
but I never expected

349
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,102
such a striking resemblance.

350
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,645
Sorry to have startled you.

351
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,860
This is my daughter, Virginia.

352
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,397
How do you do?

353
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,861
Won't you join us?

354
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,480
I've had my dinner, thanks.

355
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,403
But I would like to talk to you.

356
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,833
Do I look pale?

357
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,750
No.

358
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,758
Huh?

359
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,426
I feel pale.

360
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:38,174
The buzzer, Evans.

361
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,595
What's the matter, you deaf?

362
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,895
Did he have a good attorney?

363
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,442
Oh, one of the very best.

364
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,986
He's handled all of dad's
legal affairs for years.

365
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,235
Evans, Mr. dickson will
have coffee with us.

366
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,205
Oh, I'm Ralph dickson's brother.

367
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,417
Well, you sure had me
going for a minute.

368
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,333
But you do look
like poor Mr. Ralph.

369
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,295
Coffee.

370
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,299
Yes, sir.

371
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,720
I realize how incriminating
circumstantial evidence can

372
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,261
be, but it was never brought
home to me like this before.

373
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,475
We did everything
we possibly could.

374
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,844
You know that Ralph and my
daughter were quite serious

375
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,062
about each other.

376
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,771
Yes, he told me in
his last letter.

377
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,480
Sit down.

378
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,442
How long do you plan
to say in this country?

379
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,856
Haven't decided
yet, Mr. Kessler.

380
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,276
But I would like to find
out who killed that girl.

381
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,193
Mm.

382
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,111
It's something I would
like to know, too.

383
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:41,112
Please consider this your
home while you're here.

384
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,489
If there's anything I
can do, don't hesitate.

385
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,580
Thank you.

386
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:46,450
I'll see that your
room is put in order.

387
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,077
Are you sure I'm
not troubling you?

388
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,294
No, no, not at all.

389
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,584
Entertain Paul
until I come back.

390
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,323
Paul, oh Paul?

391
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,774
Yes?

392
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:19,741
I'll show you to your room.

393
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,745
Oh, thank you.

394
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,074
Oh, I almost forgot.

395
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,993
I must see Evans,
oh, about breakfast.

396
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,864
Well, good night Virginia.

397
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:26,865
Good night, Paul.

398
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,037
Good night, dad.

399
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:34,509
Come in.

400
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,844
I hope you'll be comfortable.

401
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,429
I'll send for your
luggage in the morning.

402
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,298
It's awfully nice
of you, Mr. Kessler.

403
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,674
Really, I hope that

404
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,891
it's a pleasure to have you.

405
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:45,805
Thank you, sir.

406
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,929
Well, I guess I'll turn in.

407
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,501
I haven't had much sleep
the last couple of nights.

408
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,014
Good night.

409
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,025
Good night, sir.

410
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:31,656
Hello, operator?

411
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,948
Give me the police department.

412
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,043
No.

413
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,579
The body has not been touched.

414
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,077
Yes.

415
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,373
Alright.

416
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,382
Good morning, Evans.

417
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,717
Morning, Mr. Kessler.

418
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,961
Now, what's the matter?

419
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,428
The gardener, sir.

420
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,137
What?

421
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,722
He's been murdered.

422
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,804
Murdered?

423
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,104
Strangled.

424
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,818
Well, here we go again.

425
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:06,902
How long did he work for you?

426
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,693
Oh, about three years, I guess.

427
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,406
Ever say anything to you
about having any enemies?

428
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,820
No, sir.

429
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,943
Were you home last night?

430
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,534
Yes, lieutenant.

431
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,620
To your knowledge, did anybody
come in or go out of the house

432
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:16,659
during the course
of the evening?

433
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,405
We have a house guest.

434
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,452
Why isn't he here?

435
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,415
I'll get him.

436
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,829
Oh, don't trouble
yourself, Mr. Kessler.

437
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:21,952
Where is he?

438
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,828
He's upstairs in his bedroom.

439
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,080
Let's have a look at him, Ryan.

440
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,635
Good morning.

441
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:35,553
You're wanted in the kitchen.

442
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,845
In the kitchen?

443
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,853
Yeah.

444
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:50,981
Am I seeing things?

445
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,323
He's Ralph's brother.

446
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,442
Why, he's the image of him.

447
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,114
How did this happen?

448
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,658
That's what we'd
like to find out.

449
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,700
He was strangled, Paul.

450
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,449
Would you mind if we
go into the library?

451
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,246
No, that's alright.

452
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,531
Better wait here for
the coroner, Ryan.

453
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:13,887
Not you, Evans.

454
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,227
Hey, where we you on the
night of January the 13th?

455
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,563
Have you had your coffee yet?

456
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,567
No.

457
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,353
Well, I guess that's that.

458
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,198
No clues, no fingerprints,
no motive, nothing.

459
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,658
But surely if a man was
choked to death there would be

460
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,822
imprints on his throat.

461
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,660
Hm.

462
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,746
There weren't any
on the mannix girl.

463
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,910
And they were killed the
same way, is that right?

464
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,203
That doesn't prove
a thing, dickson.

465
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,998
All the others got it
and always the same way.

466
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:46,836
The coroner's here.

467
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:47,882
Ok.

468
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,384
I'll be right back.

469
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,044
What does he mean by the others?

470
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,420
Just that.

471
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,138
Others have been killed here.

472
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:59,679
Why in the world do
you stay in this place?

473
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,557
We can't leave.

474
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,204
Your luggage, sir.

475
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,368
I'll put them in your room.

476
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,827
What about these other murders?

477
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,250
I'll put your luggage
in your room, sir.

478
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:37,842
Oh, lieutenant?

479
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,508
Yeah?

480
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,973
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

481
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,763
Well, that'll be
a change, anyhow.

482
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,307
What's bothering you?

483
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,270
As a rule, I'm not a very
curious person, but er..,

484
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,980
house beginning to get you, huh?

485
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,690
In a way, yes.

486
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,356
What about these other murders?

487
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,104
Well, there's been quite
a lot of them, dickson.

488
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,822
Some of the best brains
in the department

489
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,861
have tried to solve them.

490
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,326
We always run up
against a stone wall.

491
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,537
Were the other murders brought
out in my brother's trial?

492
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,202
That was different.

493
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,665
That was a cut and dried case.

494
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,705
Why haven't the police
closed the house?

495
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,078
Well, we tried to, but Mr.
Kessler took it to court.

496
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,081
Carries a lot of
weight around here.

497
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,582
He does a lot of good, too.

498
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,250
You'd think he'd want to leave.

499
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:16,672
Ah, I guess he's waiting
for his wife to come back.

500
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,511
She left him several years ago.

501
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,426
An awful scandal at the time.

502
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,798
Front page stuff and all that.

503
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,348
Poor devil.

504
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,561
He didn't have a chance.

505
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,304
Mm.

506
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,397
Well, I guess I'll
be running along.

507
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,312
Glad I met you, dickson.

508
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,183
Good day, lieutenant.

509
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,653
Well, this isn't a
very pleasant way

510
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:36,692
to entertain a guest.

511
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,034
You know, Mr. Kessler, I have
a feeling that somehow or

512
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,528
other these mysterious murders
are going to be cleared up,

513
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,121
and quickly, too.

514
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,535
Nothing will please me more.

515
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,953
Your wife?

516
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,118
Yes.

517
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,665
She's beautiful.

518
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:55,507
I rarely talk about her, but
I think about her constantly.

519
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,966
She has eyes like Virginia's.

520
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,677
Her hair, her skin.

521
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,048
They were the loveliest
I've ever seen.

522
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,802
I hope you have the
pleasure of meeting her.

523
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,225
She'll be back someday.

524
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,063
Hello there.

525
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,854
Paul was admiring
your mother's picture.

526
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,068
Father's a sentimentalist.

527
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,607
He has every right to be.

528
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,276
I'll get it.

529
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,660
Hello?

530
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,949
Yes?

531
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,697
Just a moment, please.

532
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,744
It's for you, dad.

533
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:30,992
Thank you.

534
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,494
Yes?

535
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,458
Yes, I guess I can.

536
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,081
Yes.

537
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,048
Oh, in about twenty
minutes, I'd say.

538
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,042
Surely.

539
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,045
Goodbye.

540
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,671
I'll see you children later.

541
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,682
Business.

542
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,810
Sorry.

543
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,272
That's the only information
I can give you, Mr. Kirby.

544
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,392
Have you notified his wife?

545
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,893
Yes, Mr. Kessler.

546
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,486
Poor thing, she
took it quite hard.

547
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,526
It's terrible. Awful

548
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,990
I want to see the coroner.

549
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,207
Yes?

550
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,576
I'm Jules' wife.

551
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,669
Where have they taken him?

552
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,958
In there, Mrs. Mason.

553
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,066
If you please, sir.

554
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:40,104
May I have one moment
alone with him?

555
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,278
I won't ever see him again.

556
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,775
Well yes, I guess so.

557
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:46,787
Thank you, sir.

558
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,378
Aah!

559
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,168
Mrs. Mason, Mrs. Mason.

560
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,465
You better take
her out, Mr. Kirby.

561
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,338
He's alive.

562
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,385
What?

563
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,974
He's alive.

564
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,468
I saw him move.

565
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:16,690
I'll get the hospital.

566
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,605
You'll be alright, Mrs. Mason.

567
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,772
Steady now.

568
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,028
Get him out of here.

569
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,487
He's not dead.

570
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,981
The doctor will be
here any minute.

571
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,494
Jules?

572
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,537
Please, Mrs. Mason.

573
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,089
Jules, listen to me.

574
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,504
Did you recognize the man
who tried to kill you?

575
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,361
It was ghastly.

576
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,360
I don't believe I was ever
more startled in my life than

577
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,656
when Mrs. Mason screamed.

578
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,946
It must have been
a terrific shock

579
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,413
to see him come back to life.

580
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,372
Yes, it was.

581
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,459
Just a few moments longer and
they would have known who the

582
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,794
assailant was.

583
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:23,211
I don't like to bring up
the subject, Mr. Kessler,

584
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,802
but these murders, did they
ever happen in the daytime?

585
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,670
No, I don't believe so.

586
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,841
I see.

587
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,756
You evidently have
some reason for asking.

588
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,133
Not particularly.

589
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,884
I was just curious
about that one point.

590
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:38,639
Sorry dinner is
late tonight, sir.

591
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,392
But the new cook is having
quite a time getting started.

592
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,402
That's alright.

593
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,521
Evans been with you long?

594
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,064
Over some years.

595
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,080
Everything's gone wrong today.

596
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,294
Now I burned the roast.

597
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,628
Oh, don't get so flustered.

598
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:03,587
You'll be alright.

599
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,923
I was so anxious to make
good, I want to stay.

600
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,088
Where is that mixing spoon?

601
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,303
Here it is, right
in front of you.

602
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,261
Thanks.

603
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,631
I like it here.

604
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,381
It's nice.

605
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:16,226
Everything's so quiet
and peaceful like.

606
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:18,720
Ever read the newspapers?

607
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,894
No, they're just full of
trash and murders and stuff.

608
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,729
Mm.

609
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,443
What you don't know,
well, it's alright.

610
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,812
Here's your pepper salt.

611
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,939
Thanks.

612
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,118
Well, Paul, I'm afraid
you have me cornered.

613
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,159
You still have a couple
of moves, Mr. Kessler.

614
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,906
You met your equal, dad.

615
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,201
Oh, your father just got
himself into a bad position.

616
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,628
I hear a storm.

617
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,587
It's your game, Paul.

618
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,463
Want to play another?

619
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,003
Oh, thank you, not tonight.

620
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:48,625
It's getting late.

621
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,467
Pardon me, sir.

622
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,256
Yes?

623
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,595
May I speak to you
a moment please?

624
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,634
Well yes, certainly.

625
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:58,722
The cook wants to leave.

626
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,770
I thought you should know.

627
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,938
Why, she just came.

628
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,270
She feels as if her
work is unsatisfactory.

629
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,769
She had so much trouble
with dinner tonight.

630
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,483
Why, that's ridiculous.

631
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,106
Oh, I understand,
it's her first day.

632
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,779
I'll speak to her.

633
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,196
I'll say good
night, Mr. Kessler.

634
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,159
Think I'll turn in.

635
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:16,994
Thanks for the game.

636
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:17,862
Good night, Paul.

637
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:18,488
Good night, dad.

638
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,499
Good night, child.

639
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,033
I'll walk up with you, Paul.

640
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,251
Oh, glad to have your company.

641
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,666
It's a long, lonesome climb
up those stairs all alone.

642
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,503
Where are you going, Marie?

643
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,375
You can't leave us after cooking

644
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,627
such an elegant dinner.

645
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,470
Did you really like
it, Mr. Kessler?

646
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,637
Why, I never tasted anything
to equal that roast beef.

647
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,930
Besides, you can't go now,
it's going to rain any minute.

648
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,644
Are you sure you
want me to stay?

649
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,644
Oh certainly, Marie.

650
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,231
Well, I like it here,
but I thought,

651
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,519
then it is settled.

652
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,984
Wait til you taste my
apple pie, Mr. Kessler.

653
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,023
Apple pie!

654
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,817
My, that will be a treat.

655
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,901
Let me take this.

656
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,820
You might as well unpack
your things, Marie.

657
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:55,483
Yes, sure.

658
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,195
Thank you, sir.

659
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,034
Not at all, Marie.

660
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:57,823
Good night.

661
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,286
Good night, Mr. Kessler.

662
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,827
Oh, he's a wonderful man.

663
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,718
Now let's see.

664
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,509
What did I do wrong?

665
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,144
Mr. Kessler?

666
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,409
Mr. Kessler?

667
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,619
Are you ill?

668
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,862
What?

669
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,580
Something wrong?

670
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:21,963
No, Paul.

671
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,464
I must have walked in my sleep.

672
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,135
Well, you did better than I.

673
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,303
I couldn't sleep at all.

674
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,386
It's raining.

675
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,480
Why don't you go to bed, Paul?

676
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,894
I'm alright.

677
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,980
Is there anything I can do?

678
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,445
Nothing, Paul.

679
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,529
Thank you.

680
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,023
I think I'll read for a while.

681
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,241
Good night.

682
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,576
Good night, Mr. Kessler.

683
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,801
Well, you look like you had a
good night's sleep, Mr. Kessler.

684
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,170
I was so tired
when I got to bed,

685
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,718
I don't even
remember climbing in.

686
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,179
Dad!

687
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,229
Who would do a thing like that?

688
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,529
I wonder if anyone was hurt.

689
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,871
Nothing could have
hurt my father more.

690
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:12,214
It's unquestionably
the work of a madman.

691
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,046
You alright, Evans?

692
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,544
Yes sir, Mr. Kessler.

693
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,544
Good morning, sir.

694
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,887
Where is the new cook?

695
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,927
She said she was going shopping
first thing this morning.

696
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,175
Have you looked in her room?

697
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,426
No, sir.

698
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:26,808
Something wrong, Mr. Kessler?

699
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,603
There's her valise.

700
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,570
She didn't leave.

701
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,609
I'm not worried about that.

702
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,074
When did she tell you
she's going to the market?

703
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,864
Last night before
she went to bed.

704
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,575
Do you think there's any
connection between this and

705
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,167
what has happened before?

706
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,752
I don't know.

707
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,542
Have you been through the
rest of the house yet?

708
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,665
No, sir.

709
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,587
Good morning, Mr. Kessler.

710
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:56,458
Oh, Marie.

711
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,428
You have no idea how
happy I am to see you.

712
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,473
Thank you.

713
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,183
I wonder why he was
so glad to see me.

714
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,303
Mr. Kessler thought
you had been murdered.

715
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,145
Oh, he's so sweet.

716
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,460
I'm going to start
to make an apple pie.

717
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,691
Murdered?

718
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:20,692
I can't imagine who would
do a thing like that.

719
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,035
I'll get it.

720
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,459
Good morning, miss Kessler.

721
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:31,997
Won't you come in?

722
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,006
Thank you.

723
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,427
That happened last night.

724
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,342
Didn't it fall?

725
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,509
No.

726
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,600
Find me the person who did it
and you've got your murderer.

727
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,515
Nobody came into this
house last night.

728
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,478
Ryan and his boys were
stationed outside.

729
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,972
Lieutenant?

730
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:52,984
Oh lieutenant?

731
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,339
Come out!

732
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,008
Come on out, I say!

733
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,252
It's Ryan!

734
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,263
Aah!

735
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,657
Then you didn't hear any
noises during the night?

736
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:48,620
No.

737
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,115
But there's funny things
going on around here.

738
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,366
Meaning what?

739
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,118
Well, it's happened
three times now.

740
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,245
I put food on the
sink, left the room,

741
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,917
when I come back it was gone.

742
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:58,914
No.

743
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,633
You ought to hire a
detective to watch it.

744
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,636
That's what you get for
being such an excellent cook.

745
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,008
Thank you, sir.

746
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,223
Oh lieutenant?

747
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:12,720
Yeah?

748
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:13,888
Got something?

749
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:14,854
I don't know.

750
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,349
I, I found this in the picture.

751
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,226
Anybody else know about it?

752
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,689
No, I wanted to
speak to you first.

753
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,562
Ok.

754
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,025
I'll see if I can match it.

755
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,523
Keep the others downstairs.

756
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,370
Why not?

757
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,409
I agree.

758
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,540
Is, uh, this yours, Mr. Kessler?

759
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,659
Yes.

760
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,876
Why?

761
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,164
I'd thought I'd seen it on you.

762
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,457
Found it in Evans's room.

763
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,171
Well, there's nothing
strange about that.

764
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,415
There wouldn't be, Mr. Kessler,

765
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,428
but it so happens that a
thread from this robe was

766
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,051
found embedded in the picture.

767
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,011
Surely you're not
trying to accuse Evans?

768
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,130
Oh, it's incredible.

769
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,507
You're just trying
to make a case.

770
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,008
Well, somebody's been
doing these killings.

771
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,977
Ryan didn't die of heart
failure, don't forget that.

772
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:56,017
When did you give Evans
that robe, Mr. Kessler?

773
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,140
I don't remember giving
it to him at all.

774
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,438
But naturally, when my
things need mending,

775
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,310
he just picks them up.

776
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,527
I don't care how he got it.

777
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,271
He had it and he used
it on that picture.

778
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,985
I'm going to talk to him.

779
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,108
Now just a minute, lieutenant.

780
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:07,653
Yeah?

781
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,652
If Evans is the man we want,
it strikes me you've got to

782
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,618
have more evidence.

783
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,361
Huh.

784
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,284
Now everybody wants
to be a detective.

785
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,122
Now wait a minute.

786
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,409
Perhaps Paul has
some suggestion.

787
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,626
Alright, go ahead.

788
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,664
What is it?

789
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,333
Without doubt, the
murderer is insane.

790
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,455
The picture tells us that.

791
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,799
I believe we should
call in a psychiatrist.

792
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,633
A psychiatrist.

793
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,173
You still got the robe.

794
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,218
But before Evans is accused,
I'm definitely in favor of

795
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,635
giving him a sanity test.

796
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,758
What do you say, lieutenant?

797
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,886
Ok.

798
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,888
Maybe I better take one myself.

799
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,526
All we want to know is
if the fellow's crazy.

800
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,235
That's very easy to determine.

801
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,571
Shall we make the
examination here?

802
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:47,610
If you don't mind, doctor.

803
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,825
Please tell Evans
I want to see him

804
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,159
and then go up to your room.

805
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,243
Go to my room?

806
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:57,078
Is it possible, doctor, for
a man to be normal, say,

807
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,825
for two or three
months at a time,

808
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,249
then go completely insane
for an hour or two?

809
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,621
Yes, quite common.

810
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,913
This should be most interesting.

811
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,172
Now what?

812
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,169
A fuse must have blown.

813
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,387
I'll light the candles.

814
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:23,768
A fuse burned out,
miss Virginia.

815
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:24,859
Oh, thank you.

816
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,228
My father wants
to see you, Evans.

817
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,854
He's in his room.

818
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,025
Yes, miss.

819
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,531
That will have to do, gentlemen,

820
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,623
until the lights are fixed.

821
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,378
I'll be in my room, Evans.

822
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,424
Yes, miss.

823
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,971
I'm sorry, Mr. Kessler,

824
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,094
but we ran out of fuses.

825
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,391
I sent Marie over to the
store to get some more, sir.

826
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,399
That's alright, Evans.

827
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,395
Sit down.

828
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,935
Oh, pardon me, sir.

829
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:07,982
Go ahead, Evans.

830
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,570
Sit down.

831
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,064
We want to talk to you.

832
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,986
Alright, sit down.

833
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,973
Do you want to speak to me, sir?

834
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:39,639
This gentleman would like
to ask you a few questions,

835
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,510
Evans.

836
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,604
Yes, sir?

837
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:44,144
You know these men?

838
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,735
Yes, sir.

839
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,603
What's this gentleman's name?

840
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:52,106
Mr. Kessler.

841
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,358
Mr. Charles Kessler, sir.

842
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,860
Would you say that Mr.
Kessler is out of his mind?

843
00:56:56,872 --> 00:57:00,205
Uh, I don't understand you.

844
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,325
Would you say that he is insane?

845
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:04,747
No, sir.

846
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,151
Well, young lady, what
are you doing here?

847
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,367
You can't take it.

848
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,411
It's mine, I tell you.

849
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,330
Ok, sister, it's yours.

850
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,829
Leave me alone.

851
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,001
I'm going home.

852
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:55,548
Home to my husband
and my daughter.

853
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,590
Of course you are.

854
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,838
And we know where you live, too.

855
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,180
You do?

856
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,515
Sure.

857
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:04,603
But I'm dead, understand?

858
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,562
I'm dead.

859
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,181
Of course you are.

860
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,021
I'll take you where
you want to go.

861
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,768
Now you just come
with me, young lady.

862
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:17,907
Tell me, Evans.

863
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,902
Do you think this man is crazy?

864
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,528
Now don't ask him that, doc.

865
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,576
I'm beginning to
have doubts myself.

866
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,914
Please, lieutenant.

867
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,034
Oh, alright, alright.

868
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,205
Am I crazy?

869
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,704
I don't think so.

870
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,377
You don't think so?

871
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,799
I know that woman.

872
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,971
She's wicked.

873
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,937
She can't go home.

874
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,147
Yes, yes, I know.

875
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:49,640
She's bad.

876
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,891
Now you come with me.

877
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,267
There we are.

878
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,900
Ever see this before?

879
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,118
Yes, sir.

880
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,578
What were you doing
with it last night?

881
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,914
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir.

882
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,884
Look what we found.

883
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,098
Mrs. Kessler!

884
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,348
I'm dead, Charles.

885
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,441
You hear me?

886
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,480
I'm dead.

887
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:46,113
I'm afraid to come home.

888
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,124
You'd kill me.

889
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,294
You'd kill anybody.

890
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,550
It's Kessler!

891
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,627
Take her out, quickly!

892
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:56,354
Aah!

893
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,609
Mr. Kessler!

894
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,853
Dad!

895
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:00,854
Get back in there!

896
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:01,866
Close that door!

897
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,985
Now you sit right there
and we'll see that

898
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:06,996
you get home alright.

899
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,536
Give me a hand, George.

900
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,011
She's dead.

901
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,394
What happened here?

902
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,405
We've got the murderer.

903
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,825
Evans.

904
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,829
No, Mr. Kessler, you.

905
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,446
I knew you'd come back.

906
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,120
Nothing can part
us now, my darling.
