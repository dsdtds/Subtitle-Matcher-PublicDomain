1
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:16,139
Dense forest once
covered all of Piney Ridge,

2
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,065
but no longer is the
region a mystery.

3
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:22,185
Modern highways have
penetrated the darkness,

4
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:24,188
and brought in the light.

5
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:26,916
Not so in Ox Head
Woods, further south.

6
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:29,761
Step into it off the abandoned
road that hugs its length,

7
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:34,452
and it's like passing through a wall
and closing the door behind you.

8
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:40,474
Obsolete trails wonder vaguely, crisscross,
or break at right angles for no reason.

9
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,637
Only one leads to
the Morgan farm.

10
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,701
Pete Morgan's farm has
the allure of a wall castle

11
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:51,507
that everybody knows about,
but few have entered.

12
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:57,192
Its only access to the outside world
is a country road that passes by.

13
00:01:57,193 --> 00:02:00,941
Some miles north connects with
the highway near the Renton farm.

14
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,446
Joe Renton, like the other farmers
here abouts, is up and coming,

15
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:07,149
raises good apples.

16
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:10,661
Fine soil everywhere
in the valley.

17
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,022
The young people for miles
around come to the high school.

18
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:18,305
The boys graduate a little older
than those in the city.

19
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:22,934
That's because they take time out for
planting and helping with the harvest.

20
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:24,689
They're a healthy lot.

21
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,140
And girls don't come
prettier any place.

22
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,985
Are we going swimming Sunday?

23
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,274
Sure, if I'm not
needed at the store.

24
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,657
Where do you change into
your swimming trunks?

25
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:54,330
Mmm, maybe I'll wear them over.

26
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:55,719
No.

27
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:59,078
Bring them.
We'll change at the reservoir.

28
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,979
Who else is coming?

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,582
Just us.

30
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,385
Hi Teller,
how's hunting?

31
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,470
Bye, kids. Miss me.

32
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:24,999
What are you doing so
close to civilization?

33
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,995
You're growing up, Tibby.

34
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:30,984
- You're almost a woman.
- Almost! I'm woman enough already.

35
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,517
I wouldn't say that.

36
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:38,541
Oh, what do you know about anything,
you never got past the ninth grade.

37
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,142
I'm good at plenty of things
they don't teach in school.

38
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:09,193
What's got into you, Meg?
You got the fidgets?

39
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:15,261
I promised Pete Morgan I'd bring you by the farm
this afternoon, and I don't know how to ask you.

40
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:17,168
Looks like you've
asked me already.

41
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:19,071
What does he want?

42
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:20,913
You better ask him.

43
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:22,951
Well, how long will it take?

44
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,702
Not too awfully long, Nath.

45
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,702
We're here already.

46
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:32,525
OK, Meg, let's go.

47
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:40,837
Hey, Nath, what's Tibby
going to say about this?

48
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:43,441
What do you think she'll do?

49
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:07,402
Pete?

50
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,074
Yes, Meg.

51
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,850
I brought Nath Storm,
the boy I told you about.

52
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:26,119
You know, I've...

53
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,623
I've thought
about this thing, Meg.

54
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,756
I'm not so sure
it's a good thing.

55
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:34,196
We've been content with
the way things were.

56
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:36,689
Maybe an outsider will spoil it.

57
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:42,380
But it would be so much easier for you if Nath
would come and help out at the end of the day.

58
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:46,188
- Anything between you and Nath?
- Oh, no.

59
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:49,355
He and Tibby Renton
are going steady.

60
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:52,604
All right, I'll see the boy.

61
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:56,050
Never could turn
you down, could I?

62
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:15,275
Meg says good things
about you, Nath.

63
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,369
Maybe you're not as
stocky as you might be.

64
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,484
Stopped growing too
soon, Mr. Morgan.

65
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:27,106
- How's your mother's store getting along?
- Oh well, some days we don't even make a $1.

66
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:32,117
What did you want to see
me about, Mr. Morgan?

67
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,857
You know about my leg?

68
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:37,145
Wood.

69
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:40,450
My sister and Meg have
got a curious idea that

70
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:44,156
it's hard to climb a ladder
with a wooden leg.

71
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,145
- Well, it isn't.
- No, sir.

72
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:50,936
What's more, they've got an idea that
things are getting a little run down here,

73
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,829
can't do as much as I used to.

74
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,400
So they've talked me
into hiring somebody.

75
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,946
Eh, help along with
the evening chores.

76
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:00,679
I'll pay $0.35 an hour.

77
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:08,585
Could you make it 4 bits?

78
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:11,399
It's over an hour's
walk home afterwards.

79
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:14,486
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

80
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:18,480
- I'll pay $0.50 a hour.
- Could he start today?

81
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:26,293
- Sure it's all right with you, Meg?
- Oh, yes.

82
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:28,898
Thanks!

83
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:31,250
Come on, Nath.

84
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:41,671
Ellen?

85
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,235
Ellen!

86
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,700
- He's hired Nath.
- Good.

87
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:53,199
I just hope that Pete hasn't become
too used to doing things alone.

88
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,671
I do hope it works out.

89
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:19,952
- You sure you don't want any more, Nath?
- No, thanks, ma'am.

90
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:23,521
Bet nobody'll believe me when
I tell them I had supper here.

91
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,715
Why not, Nath?

92
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,654
Well, didn't you know you
and Miss Ellen are known as...

93
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,629
the mysterious Morgans?

94
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,074
Are we?

95
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:34,478
Well, they won't
say it anymore.

96
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:37,187
Not when I tell them what a
swell layout you've got here.

97
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,595
And that you spread the
best table in the valley.

98
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:42,402
It's because we're so
self-sufficient here.

99
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:45,511
We seldom have any
need to go to town.

100
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:48,399
What else do they
say about us, Nath?

101
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,466
Oh, nothing.

102
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,065
Except things like...

103
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,269
Meg not being your daughter,

104
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,972
or even related.

105
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:02,385
Why don't they ask me?

106
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:07,582
Well I... I guess they'd rather whisper
gossip than find out the truth.

107
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,486
What gossip?

108
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,831
Well, they say...

109
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:17,837
Meg's mother and father ran away
and left her when she was still a baby.

110
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,685
Well, that's not true, Nath.

111
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,821
Meg's mother and father went
down south to find a new farm.

112
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:27,236
- They left Meg in our care.
- They died down there in a runaway.

113
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:31,728
Pete and I adopted Meg legally. There's
nothing to be whispered about, Nath.

114
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,276
She was only two
years old then.

115
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,729
There's nothing wrong
with being adopted.

116
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,825
I'm grateful.

117
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,828
Sure.

118
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:48,021
And the next time I hear anybody
gossiping about it, I'll say, so what?

119
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,792
Meg isn't the only
adopted girl in the world.

120
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:05,305
Well, I... I hate to eat and run, folks,
but... I think I better get started.

121
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,942
It's kind of late so I thought I'd take
a shortcut through Ox Head Woods.

122
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:26,157
- You know your way through those woods?
- No, but the winds cleared the sky.

123
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,345
Well, I'd take the long
way around if I were you.

124
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:34,134
I've owned the Ox Head
Woods for years and...

125
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:38,609
I'm as brave as the next man, but I wouldn't
cross through those woods at night.

126
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,239
The woods haven't scared
me since I was a kid.

127
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,368
- Day or night.
- But you said you didn't know Ox Head Woods.

128
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,418
- A tree is a tree, and a trail is a trail.
- The trails lead nowhere.

129
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,687
- Let the boy go, Pete.
- I don't want him to get lost.

130
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,668
- Close the door, Pete.
- I don't want him to get hurt.

131
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:58,906
Wait, don't take the Ox Head Woods.
The foot bridge across the creek is out.

132
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:00,756
- I'll jump across.
- Well there's bog on the other side.

133
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:03,105
I'll find my way around it.
Look, Mr. Morgan, I can't...

134
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:06,033
- It's a long way around.
- I'll save two miles by cutting through the woods.

135
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:10,049
But you won't save yourself from the screams
in the night, It'll lodge in your bones all your life.

136
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,805
- Screams from where?
- From the red house.

137
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:17,742
Well, if I come to it,
I'll give it a wide go by.

138
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,447
You can't!

139
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:25,394
Did you ever run
away from the scream?

140
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:27,517
Hey Nath!

141
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,160
It will follow you
through the woods.

142
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,654
It will follow you
all of your life.

143
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:38,054
Nath! Nath!

144
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,433
What did you say to him?

145
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,999
Nath's a brave lad,
but he's fooled.

146
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,430
I warned him but
he wouldn't listen.

147
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:46,181
You warned him against what?

148
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:48,493
Courage isn't enough.

149
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,553
He won't make it.

150
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:52,812
He'll be back.

151
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:55,419
He'll be back.

152
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:47,290
Yes, Mrs. Storm, Nath's sleeping here
tonight, so don't you worry about it.

153
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:51,995
Hard work and a big
supper never hurt any boy.

154
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:55,329
Oh, don't you mention it,
we're glad to have him.

155
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,023
Good night.

156
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:00,573
How did you know he was back?

157
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:12,384
Nath's all right.

158
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,619
He's going to be a
great help on the farm.

159
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:46,382
How did you happen
to get in here?

160
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,280
I ran here.

161
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:51,652
You scared the daylights
out of me last night.

162
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:56,180
Seems like the truth shouldn't
scare anybody. Man or boy.

163
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,764
The truth?

164
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:01,415
- You and your screams in the night almost...
- What are you talking about?

165
00:17:02,718 --> 00:17:05,402
Now, don't tell me I
imagined all that stuff?

166
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:07,194
I went in those words
and I heard things.

167
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,401
- What things?
- I don't know.

168
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:13,554
I don't know whether it was the screams
you were talking about or... just the wind.

169
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,219
You leave well
enough alone, son.

170
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,356
Go in and wash up.

171
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:24,264
Join us for breakfast, and you can
catch the school bus with Meg.

172
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,047
What kind of a guy
is Pete anyway?

173
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,727
He's always been
wonderful to me.

174
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,874
And kind and generous.

175
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,618
For my last birthday, he sent to the city

176
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,954
and bought me the most wonderful
furniture he could buy for my room.

177
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,546
He's always been that way.

178
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:58,138
But... what about
that red house?

179
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,206
I remember hearing him talk
about it a long time ago.

180
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:07,268
But I've never heard
him mention it since.

181
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,973
- You haven't?
- No.

182
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:14,410
He's just warned me to stay out
of those woods, since I was little.

183
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,363
Do you know anything
about those screams?

184
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:30,462
I don't know, Nath.
I may be afraid to find out.

185
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,108
Hey, look whose
moved in with the Morgans.

186
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:40,206
OK, so I'm working there,
so make something out of it.

187
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,436
Well,

188
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,811
you've got nerve,
Nath Storm.

189
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:06,722
Where were you last night when
I phoned like I said I would?

190
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:09,276
- Working.
- Working?

191
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:10,806
All night long?

192
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:13,381
Ah, Tibby, can't a guy even
earn chore money at the Morgans

193
00:19:13,382 --> 00:19:16,934
- without you throwing a fit?
- Not if it takes all night.

194
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,192
Hi, mom.

195
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,506
I see you're not bowled over
by the rush of business.

196
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:59,134
Oh, things have been
like this all day again.

197
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:03,291
I suppose folks get tired coming
and asking for things I haven't got.

198
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:05,454
Look, mom.

199
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,946
Why don't you close the
store and marry Don Brant.

200
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:09,919
He's a nice guy.

201
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:14,294
Now there's time enough for Don and me to get
married after you're out of school and on your own.

202
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,930
Graduation's just
around the corner.

203
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:23,008
Why don't you two go and get married while
you're still young enough to enjoy it?

204
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:26,744
Shame on you, talking
to your mother that way.

205
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:29,455
Well, you've given
enough your life to me.

206
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:33,261
You go down to town and tell
Don you're ready anytime he is.

207
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:36,495
He's being transferred north.

208
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,229
Well, that settles it.

209
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,424
Here he's been courting you
since I was in grammar school.

210
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:44,573
If you don't marry him now,
he'll meet some chick up north,

211
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:48,081
and then you'll be a dead duck.

212
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:51,371
Well, I've got to change.
I'll be late at the Morgans.

213
00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:54,979
- How do you like it up there?
- Oh, it's OK.

214
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,693
They eat good.
I mean, well.

215
00:20:57,694 --> 00:21:00,101
A couple of things
got me wondering.

216
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:02,490
How did Pete Morgan
lose his leg?

217
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:04,701
He fell down a cliff
in the Ox Head Woods.

218
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:07,587
It was a long time ago,
you were still a baby.

219
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:10,277
It was Dr. Burns first
case in the valley.

220
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:13,830
He amputated the leg on
the Morgan kitchen table.

221
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:16,421
I wonder if it's
the one I ate at.

222
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:20,394
That was the first time Dr.
Burn ever met Ellen Morgan.

223
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:23,864
Everybody knew he fell in love with her,
but nothing ever came of it.

224
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,751
- I wonder why. He's still a bachelor.
- I don't know.

225
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:31,519
They still act like they love each other,
the few times I've seen them meet.

226
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,826
But she chose to devote her life
to her brother Pete, I guess.

227
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,515
Seems a shame.

228
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:41,341
Just like it would be a shame if you
don't marry Don and go north with him.

229
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,946
If I do, how long will it be before
you and Tibby get married?

230
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,690
Oh, search me.

231
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:50,466
Sometimes the more I know about women,
the less I know about women.

232
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:54,582
Guy needs more than a high school education
just to find out what they're going to do next.

233
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,171
Will you be staying at
the Morgans again tonight?

234
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:58,397
No.

235
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:01,005
I'm going to take a shortcut through
Ox Head Woods by daylight,

236
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:02,938
so I'll know my way
back here tonight.

237
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:04,928
Well, if you should
change your mind,

238
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:09,435
would you care if I go down to town,
and talk things over Don?

239
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:11,726
You do more than
talk things over.

240
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,058
You come back here a bride.

241
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:17,865
We don't want any dead ducks
in the family, do we?

242
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,909
How are the hens doing?

243
00:23:47,988 --> 00:23:51,096
We always have more
eggs than we can use.

244
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,982
Meg?

245
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:05,913
I guess Nath asked a lot of questions
on the way to school this morning.

246
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:09,198
Yes, but only questions
I've wondered about myself.

247
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,713
Things you've never explained.

248
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:13,802
Can't you tell me, Pete?

249
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:17,308
Well, I didn't know that
anything covered you.

250
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,041
Why are you suddenly
questioning things?

251
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,135
Because of him?

252
00:24:24,438 --> 00:24:26,222
Maybe.

253
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,613
Well, maybe he won't come back.

254
00:24:29,614 --> 00:24:31,406
I think he will.

255
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,297
I hope he does.

256
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,774
All of a sudden you
seem so grown up.

257
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:49,775
And I guess I don't
like to see it happen.

258
00:24:50,273 --> 00:24:52,748
I wish you were a child again.

259
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:56,045
I wish you needed me
just as you did then.

260
00:24:58,576 --> 00:25:02,048
I don't want you ever
to grow away from us.

261
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:05,019
You mean everything
to Ellen and me.

262
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,896
I want you to be happy.

263
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:10,126
I love you both very much.

264
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,118
You're late today.

265
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,140
I had to go home first.

266
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:42,524
I came here through
Ox Head Woods.

267
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:46,354
Yes, that would be
the quickest. Day times.

268
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,786
Or any other time.

269
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:54,788
Don't put so high a price
on courage, son. It's overrated.

270
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:58,738
The lowest animals got
more courage than man has.

271
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:02,895
You touch a snapping turtle with a
stick and he grabs at it with his teeth.

272
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,398
Cut his head off,

273
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:08,404
and he...
he still won't let go.

274
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:12,010
Now, we humans
weren't made that way.

275
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:14,104
We were born helpless.

276
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:18,459
But we don't have to stay that way.
Nobody's gonna call me yellow.

277
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,071
Who has?

278
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:22,118
Nobody, yet.

279
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,023
And nobody's going to.

280
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:26,027
- Has he been outside tonight?
- No.

281
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:27,995
Give me your word.

282
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:29,403
Of course.

283
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:33,458
Why, you're soaked through, Nath.
Get a blanket from the chest, Meg.

284
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:36,065
You can stay in
the helper's cabin.

285
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:38,704
I warned you.

286
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,558
But you wouldn't listen.

287
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,085
It wasn't a piece of that red house
that knocked me into the stream, Mr. Morgan.

288
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:46,356
And it wasn't a scream in the
night that bowled me over.

289
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:50,030
It was a human, a human strong
enough to nearly killed me.

290
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:52,055
I figured it was you.

291
00:28:54,261 --> 00:28:58,667
Sometimes we figure too
much, son, the wrong things.

292
00:28:58,668 --> 00:29:01,536
Things that can't
ever be figured.

293
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:04,445
And it's bad, bad for everyone.

294
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,572
It's quicksand.

295
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,968
I need your help here, Nath.

296
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:12,362
Why would I want to hurt you?

297
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,702
What do you think
happened, Pete?

298
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,493
There's a curse on those woods.

299
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:45,765
We know that.

300
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,531
Are you going to
stay with us, Nath?

301
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:08,278
- Why shouldn't I?
- Well, after what's happened, I thought...

302
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,092
and Tibby doesn't
want you to, does she?

303
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:17,885
After what's happened, you couldn't get me
out of here with a triple barreled shotgun.

304
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:20,573
Last night I was a coward.

305
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:26,293
There's some connection between
Pete's red house and whoever hit me.

306
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:28,678
I'm going to find out what goes on
out there if it takes exploring

307
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,789
every Sunday between now and doomsday.

308
00:30:30,812 --> 00:30:32,822
I'll help you.

309
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,649
I thought Pete told you
not to go in those woods.

310
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,797
I can't help it, I want to.

311
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,597
OK.

312
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:41,902
Sunday we'll go prowling.

313
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:53,141
What about your
date with Tibby?

314
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,574
I want her to be
sure that...

315
00:30:57,575 --> 00:31:01,080
that I don't want you to stay
here just because...

316
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:05,870
I mean, I don't want her to think
I'm trying to steal you away from her.

317
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:08,322
We did have a date to go
swimming Sunday anyway.

318
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:12,039
So maybe asking her to come along would
keep her from throwing another fit.

319
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:16,924
- Goodnight, Nath, and thanks.
- Goodnight, Meg.

320
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:39,856
Help me down, honey.

321
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:50,090
- Don't drop me.
- Drop you? Who's got hold of who?

322
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:59,370
Hey, kids.

323
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:04,914
I found an old trail,
maybe it leads somewhere.

324
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,182
- Another dead end.
- They're all dead ends, I'm hot.

325
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,714
We've been on a wild goose
chase for four solid hours.

326
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,550
Find your haunted
house on your own time.

327
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:39,557
You're on my time now.

328
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:43,194
Or have you forgotten we had a
date to go swimming this afternoon?

329
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,327
Just the two of us...

330
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,331
remember?

331
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:53,162
Let's go back to the farm, kids.
The sun'll be just right for swimming.

332
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:01,653
Nath! What's happened to you?

333
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:04,208
Why, what's the matter?

334
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:07,118
Well, there's a black and blue
streak across your shoulder.

335
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,583
- How'd you get it?
- Oh, that!

336
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,832
- I.. I don't know.
- Of course you know.

337
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:15,804
You might let me
in on your secrets.

338
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:17,772
We haven't any secrets.

339
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:19,545
We told you about the red house.

340
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:24,259
Look, Tibby, I, uh, I slipped in the stream
last night and fell on my shoulder.

341
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,475
- Come on, I'll race you across the pond.
- Aren't you coming in?

342
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:31,176
You had a swimming date,
just the two of you, remember?

343
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:32,979
I'll sun.

344
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,109
Winner!

345
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:26,777
- Do you love me?
- Sure.

346
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:29,428
Just keep me well kissed.

347
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:31,538
I like to be kissed.

348
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:46,160
Hey, lovebirds, dinner's ready!

349
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:01,298
Are you and Nath planning
to be married, Tibby?

350
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,802
Well, I like to keep
him guessing, Mr. Morgan.

351
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:07,293
She's like an ornery heifer
sometimes, hard to hold down.

352
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:10,819
We're glad to have
you at our house, Tibby.

353
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,126
We've missed having company,
you must come back often.

354
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:17,231
Besides, we like
to keep Nath happy.

355
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,720
We had a pleasant day?

356
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:24,976
Well, we wasted most of it looking for a
haunted house in the Ox Head Woods.

357
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,975
I didn't know there was a haunted
house in the Ox Head Woods.

358
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:38,484
Well, Nath says it's red and he's
got to find it. Isn't that silly?

359
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,353
Yes, it is.

360
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,180
Meg go with you?

361
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:59,934
Seems there's enough trouble in this world
without having to go out and look for it.

362
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,770
Well, I'm all the trouble he
can handle if he only knew it.

363
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:18,248
Well, that's a well one you are
keeping a secret, blabbing to Pete.

364
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,255
I didn't blab, it just slipped out.

365
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,826
And a fine swimming date
we had, I don't think.

366
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:26,018
You know, Tibby,

367
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:29,351
you're might pretty,
especially when you're mad.

368
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:32,344
And I guess maybe,
maybe when you're mad,

369
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:35,164
you're just about the
prettiest gal there is.

370
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:41,070
Are you sure you don't want me to get
Pete's pickup truck and drive you home?

371
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:43,324
Can't have your
cake and eat it too.

372
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,938
You have chores to do.

373
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:49,144
I'll walk home, thanks.

374
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,234
Don't suppose I'll be seeing
much of you weeknights.

375
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:56,470
Well, what with final exams
coming up and this new job...

376
00:37:56,471 --> 00:37:58,162
I know.

377
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:02,481
Would it be too much to ask that
we spend next Sunday by ourselves?

378
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,032
Just you and me?

379
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,304
Or is it more important to play
hide and seek in the woods with Meg?

380
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:09,392
Go on, get madder.

381
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:11,482
It makes your cheeks pink.

382
00:38:14,455 --> 00:38:17,690
Don't think you're going to
talk me into a kiss goodbye.

383
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:20,132
I want you to miss 'em,

384
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:24,138
long enough to make them more
important than... haunted houses.

385
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,301
So save it for next Sunday.

386
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,359
I thought you
were napping, Pete.

387
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:48,483
You disobeyed me.

388
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:57,818
Now you listen to me.

389
00:38:57,914 --> 00:38:59,645
I'm listening.

390
00:39:00,024 --> 00:39:01,437
You went into the
woods with Nath.

391
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:04,843
- Well, why shouldn't I, there only...
- Because I've asked you not to.

392
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:08,955
We didn't find anything, all we did was keep
getting into one dead end after another.

393
00:39:08,956 --> 00:39:11,804
I don't care,
now you listen to me.

394
00:39:12,574 --> 00:39:15,080
All I have in the world is you.

395
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,988
If there's anything you want, I'll get it for you,
But there's one thing you've got to do for me.

396
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,237
You stay out of those woods!

397
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:23,784
I've grown up, and I've got
a right to do as I please.

398
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:26,913
I've never laid hands on you in my life.

399
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:29,338
But I'll take the
whip to you if you do!

400
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,042
Pete!

401
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:05,649
Hi, Teller.

402
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,081
- Headed for home?
- Uh-huh.

403
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:12,656
- That's what I figured. You been swimming?
- How'd you know?

404
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:15,612
Got your suit in
that bag, haven't you?

405
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:19,545
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

406
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,355
What for?

407
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:24,900
I want you to do me a favor.

408
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:28,778
You've got looks and
all the rest besides.

409
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:30,670
Besides that, I figure
you're the kind that's got

410
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:34,147
more sense in your head
than comes out of your mouth.

411
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:36,700
Maybe I have.

412
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,694
What kind of favor
you want out of me?

413
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,969
I've got 750 bucks.

414
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:46,823
I want you to buy me
a government bond.

415
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:50,771
$750, where'd you get it,
you steal it?

416
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:54,493
I want you to buy me that bond.

417
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,144
Have them write my name on it and
buy it the next time you go to town.

418
00:40:59,214 --> 00:41:00,742
There's an extra $10
for your trouble.

419
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:03,568
- Oh I couldn't take money...
- Sure, you could.

420
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:07,160
And keep your
mouth shut to boot.

421
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:09,611
I'll be waiting every
Sunday till you bring it.

422
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:12,097
Why don't you buy it yourself.

423
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:15,804
'Cause the guy in the village
bank's got too long a nose.

424
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:21,332
And because it'll be a prettier
bond if you buy it for me.

425
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:24,943
I better get home.

426
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,582
Do you want me to help
you cross the stream?

427
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:01,517
Thanks a lot, Teller.

428
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:04,008
Is that all the thanks I get?

429
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,813
How much more do you want?

430
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,545
Teller.

431
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:02,049
You'll either protect these woods
of mine or I get someone who can.

432
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,797
Oh, why don't you keep
your trespassers at home?

433
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:07,350
You gave me full rights to
the Ox Head Woods exclusive.

434
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,059
I gave you the game rights in exchange
for keeping trespassers out.

435
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,866
Look, Mr. Morgan, if you can't keep
your own hired hand out of these woods,

436
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:17,293
maybe I should use more than a
club to scare him away with.

437
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,877
Oh, why don't you?

438
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:24,326
- You telling me I can use my gun?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt but...

439
00:43:24,419 --> 00:43:30,136
there's no better way of backing up a No Trespassing
sign than by a bullet missing somebody's skull.

440
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:38,734
OK, Mr. Morgan,
I'll take care of my end.

441
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:42,548
- This is going to be fun.
- And it's going to be more than that.

442
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:44,899
It's your last chance.

443
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:02,656
"Be kind one to another,

444
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:05,427
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

445
00:44:05,428 --> 00:44:09,633
even as God, for Christ's sake,
has forgiven you."

446
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:15,689
Dear Heavenly Father,
we pray to thee

447
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,040
to bless all those on earth
who are suffering

448
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,589
in heart and mind,

449
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,793
body and spirit.

450
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:31,631
Grant them the blessing of
hope and faith and strength...

451
00:44:33,335 --> 00:44:35,037
and peace.

452
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,596
Amen.

453
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,999
What's troubling you, Pete?

454
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,792
You haven't eaten,
you haven't slept.

455
00:45:12,132 --> 00:45:13,782
Hello?

456
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:16,252
Yes Tibby, I'll call him.

457
00:45:16,253 --> 00:45:17,925
Tibby wants you.

458
00:45:19,302 --> 00:45:21,369
Hello, Tibby.

459
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,101
No, I'm coming over.

460
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:26,335
Or you can use the
pickup truck, Nath.

461
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,834
Pete says I can use
his pickup truck.

462
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,556
I'll come on down.

463
00:45:30,692 --> 00:45:32,281
Bye.

464
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:35,826
You know, when I was
a young man and in love,

465
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:39,032
Sunday was always
a good day for spooning.

466
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,746
Thanks for the
use of the truck.

467
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:45,334
Always ready to give love
a helping hand,

468
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:47,338
aren't we, Meg?

469
00:45:49,278 --> 00:45:50,867
That's right.

470
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:56,432
Now, I might add, it's a lot
healthier than prowling in woods.

471
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:13,840
I don't care what Pete said, I wish
we were prowling in the woods today.

472
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:15,773
I wish Tibby'd
forgotten our date.

473
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,701
So do I.

474
00:46:18,797 --> 00:46:21,481
There's something
out in those woods.

475
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:26,133
Something tells me we won't find out
what it is until I find the red house.

476
00:46:27,615 --> 00:46:30,942
What are we going to do
with it when we find it?

477
00:46:30,943 --> 00:46:33,998
Bust it open, I guess,
and let some light in.

478
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,611
Maybe it'll shake the creeps
out of a lot of things.

479
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:40,094
We'll find it.

480
00:47:06,131 --> 00:47:07,833
I, uh...

481
00:47:08,987 --> 00:47:11,842
I got this for your graduation.

482
00:47:12,131 --> 00:47:15,194
I wasn't going to give
it to you until then, but...

483
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:17,899
because it's a gray day and...

484
00:47:18,201 --> 00:47:20,604
because I want you to be happy...

485
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:22,706
I, uh...

486
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,711
go ahead, open it.

487
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:38,366
Oh, how beautiful!

488
00:47:38,668 --> 00:47:41,921
- You like it?
- Oh, I love it.

489
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:45,145
Oh, uh, let me put it on, huh?

490
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:59,637
Now will you forgive me for
barking at you last Sunday?

491
00:48:01,372 --> 00:48:04,200
I didn't exactly disobey, Pete.

492
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:06,625
I've always wanted to
go into those woods.

493
00:48:06,626 --> 00:48:09,761
I did it because
I felt I had to.

494
00:48:10,872 --> 00:48:12,474
Strange.

495
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,802
I felt I belonged there.

496
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,728
Don't ever go near
those woods again.

497
00:48:31,996 --> 00:48:33,802
Thanks for the watch.

498
00:48:33,803 --> 00:48:35,431
I'll treasure it all my life.

499
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:41,724
Tibby, you've
got Meg all wrong.

500
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:44,450
Didn't she ask you up to
spend the day and have dinner?

501
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:46,005
Yeah, but why?

502
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:48,971
Can't anybody do anything without
you figuring they've got an angle?

503
00:53:48,972 --> 00:53:52,018
I've always got an angle.
I've got an angle on you!

504
00:53:52,019 --> 00:53:54,293
A girl always has a reason
when she does something.

505
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,215
- Does she?
- Sure.

506
00:53:56,216 --> 00:53:57,565
OK.

507
00:53:57,566 --> 00:54:00,655
And what's your reason for
dawdling with that guy Teller?

508
00:54:00,656 --> 00:54:03,585
- What do you mean dawdling?
- Just what I said.

509
00:54:03,586 --> 00:54:05,431
You think I didn't see you?

510
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:07,836
How could you?
Where were you?

511
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:09,489
In the bus.

512
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,000
Where'd you think I was?

513
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:13,105
Oh, that.

514
00:54:13,106 --> 00:54:14,589
Yes, that.

515
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,875
Was there some more dawdling
I didn't know about?

516
00:54:16,876 --> 00:54:20,468
You don't think I'd be interested in a
big dumb ox who makes his living hunting?

517
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:23,463
Well, you were interested enough
to stop and talk to him that afternoon.

518
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:26,613
Well, he was sitting on our rocks.
I told him to get off them.

519
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:28,120
What did he say?

520
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:29,750
He said he would.

521
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:32,780
- I'll bet.
- You calling me a liar?

522
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:36,479
Now don't make something out of nothing.
All I said was, I'll bet.

523
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,882
- You bet what?
- I'll bet...

524
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:42,088
he said he'd get off your rocks.

525
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:45,553
Is that calling you a liar?

526
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:50,444
Pop was right.

527
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:52,073
Right about what?

528
00:54:52,074 --> 00:54:56,544
You're too bright to be wasting your time
up at the Morgans' for four bits an hour.

529
00:54:56,545 --> 00:54:58,897
Well, they just
live off their farm.

530
00:54:58,898 --> 00:55:01,607
We make a profit on ours.

531
00:55:01,608 --> 00:55:04,976
Since when is there a law
against living off the earth?

532
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:07,861
We're going to live
off the earth some day.

533
00:55:07,862 --> 00:55:11,353
Before we're finished, we're gonna
leave our kids a good farm.

534
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:15,685
I want to clear out of these
hills when I get married.

535
00:55:15,986 --> 00:55:18,136
- Since when?
- Since now.

536
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:20,920
I don't want to be
just any farm wife.

537
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:24,287
This is a good a time as
any other to find that out.

538
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,656
Well, if you love someone,
you'll do anything for 'em.

539
00:55:32,657 --> 00:55:35,062
That works both ways.

540
00:55:35,401 --> 00:55:38,487
Maybe someday you'll
own this whole valley,

541
00:55:38,488 --> 00:55:41,298
and we can spend our
winters in the city house.

542
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:42,810
Sure.

543
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:46,004
With two station
wagons and a limousine.

544
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,089
Why not?

545
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:53,873
- I better get back to the Morgans'.
- What for?

546
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:57,189
Let you go on with your dreaming.
I'm disturbing your sleep.

547
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,620
City house, station wagons,
limousines. Great.

548
00:56:01,937 --> 00:56:05,629
Boy, when you dream,
you really dream good.

549
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:11,361
Well, aren't I
worth working for?

550
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:12,933
Sure.

551
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:15,966
And a lot of guys are working
on getting to the moon in a rocket.

552
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:18,072
They think that's
worth working for.

553
00:56:18,073 --> 00:56:20,119
But I like the
ground around here.

554
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,610
And I just as soon
keep my feet on it.

555
00:56:22,611 --> 00:56:25,726
How much money have
you saved doing it?

556
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:27,731
None yet.

557
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:30,723
Not even $750?

558
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:33,683
Not even 750 cents.

559
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:35,322
Why?

560
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:38,048
Nothing, I was just thinking.

561
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,435
Nath, didn't Meg go with you?
I thought she did.

562
00:56:52,436 --> 00:56:54,078
She was gone when you left.

563
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,944
- Didn't she leave with you this noon?
- No, only as far as the porch.

564
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:58,934
Did she say she was going anywhere?

565
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:01,564
She must have gone
into the woods alone.

566
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:08,374
Meg!

567
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:13,285
Meg!

568
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:15,589
Nath!

569
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,967
I knew you'd come.

570
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:32,795
Are you hurt?

571
00:57:33,182 --> 00:57:35,592
Yes, I think maybe
my leg's broken.

572
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,120
Here, hold this.

573
00:57:40,412 --> 00:57:44,241
Now, put all your
weight on the other leg.

574
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:03,122
We were happy here
till that boy came.

575
00:58:03,123 --> 00:58:05,626
Meg loved me,
trusted me,

576
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:07,931
did everything I asked.

577
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,214
Then he came.

578
00:58:12,716 --> 00:58:14,689
I'm losing her.

579
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:23,522
I've fought fate 15
years ago, and I lost.

580
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:29,605
You know that, Ellen.

581
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:37,200
- I tried to stay away from that house.
- Yes, Pete, you tried.

582
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:39,721
She kept calling.

583
00:58:39,813 --> 00:58:42,204
I had to go to her.

584
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:45,246
Don't dig it up again, dear.

585
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:48,017
Let's bury it, it's past.

586
00:58:48,018 --> 00:58:49,966
Buried until that
boy came here.

587
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:54,501
Nath doesn't know anything about it,
Pete, that's all in your mind.

588
00:58:54,727 --> 00:58:58,696
Do you think there's a man on earth
who hasn't something to conceal?

589
00:58:58,697 --> 00:59:01,342
Every living soul has
his Ox Head Woods.

590
00:59:01,343 --> 00:59:04,090
I can still see her.

591
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:06,589
She knew there was nothing
I could do about it.

592
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:09,564
- He knew it.
- Don't dig it up again, dear, please. Forget...

593
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:12,988
- Why didn't Nath go before it happened?
- Please.

594
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:15,567
Why did she scream?

595
00:59:15,863 --> 00:59:18,310
I loved her, she knew it.

596
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:22,893
- Why did she cry out?
- Shh.

597
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,877
It's been 15 years, dear.

598
00:59:24,878 --> 00:59:26,570
Put it out of your mind.

599
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:29,237
Don't let it drive
you mad again.

600
00:59:29,238 --> 00:59:31,783
It's gone. It's over.

601
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:34,294
It can't touch Meg.

602
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,005
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- There is something we can do about it.

603
00:59:38,006 --> 00:59:39,990
We can protect
her from the past.

604
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:43,379
How can I protect her from the past
when I can't shut it out myself?

605
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,996
- We can shut it out of this house!
- No, no, this isn't my house.

606
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:51,257
There's no certain
place for me on earth

607
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:54,326
except out there
in that icehouse.

608
00:59:54,355 --> 00:59:56,198
That's where I belong.

609
00:59:58,688 --> 01:00:02,656
- What if Meg should find out?
- Pete, Pete, how could she find out?

610
01:00:02,657 --> 01:00:04,449
I didn't want her to go.

611
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:08,142
I'd rather she was dead than ever hear
the screams. I'd rather she was dead.

612
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:11,472
I'd rather I died out
there in the muck and dirt.

613
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:13,484
That's where I belong.

614
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,420
- I should have burned that place down.
- No, no.

615
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:18,592
They'd search the ashes
and find her screaming.

616
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:21,240
I should've burned it down and
the icehouse and the woods with it.

617
01:00:21,241 --> 01:00:24,295
Don't you dare.
Don't never dare.

618
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:27,045
Ellen, Pete!
Open the door!

619
01:00:27,346 --> 01:00:28,849
Ellen!

620
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:35,939
What's happened to her?

621
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,655
I found her in your woods.
Her leg's broken.

622
01:00:38,656 --> 01:00:41,388
- Call Dr. Byrne.
- Call Jonathan, Pete.

623
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:04,011
Dr. Byrne.

624
01:01:05,517 --> 01:01:09,447
Dr. Byrne? This is Pete Morgan,
we need you.

625
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:11,560
Meg's leg is broken.

626
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:13,406
Come quick.

627
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:39,800
It's Nath.

628
01:01:42,864 --> 01:01:44,928
Somebody'll hear you.

629
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:52,980
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

630
01:01:52,981 --> 01:01:56,795
- Why did you wait so long?
- Ellen wouldn't let me come.

631
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,024
I never thought of climbing
that tree until tonight.

632
01:02:00,025 --> 01:02:02,855
I wanted to tell you
about the red house.

633
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:05,146
I followed some wagon
tracks through the woods.

634
01:02:05,147 --> 01:02:07,086
- They were all grown...
- Where did they start?

635
01:02:07,087 --> 01:02:08,778
I don't know.

636
01:02:08,779 --> 01:02:13,588
I headed up hill just past the big
limestone rocks we saw that Sunday.

637
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:16,790
How's Tibby?

638
01:02:17,463 --> 01:02:18,852
Search me.

639
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:23,429
She's gone to town for something,
graduation dress, I think.

640
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,320
Bet you miss her.

641
01:02:30,201 --> 01:02:32,110
Tell me about the red house.

642
01:02:32,111 --> 01:02:34,802
After the limestone rocks, what?

643
01:02:34,886 --> 01:02:37,317
Well, I followed these
tracks through the rocks.

644
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:39,244
The road's hard to follow,
but it led to this hill.

645
01:02:39,245 --> 01:02:40,508
What hill?

646
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:44,291
I don't know, I was too busy
following the tracks to see.

647
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,037
I looked down from the
top into the rocks.

648
01:02:48,038 --> 01:02:49,348
And there it was.

649
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,617
What does it look like?

650
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:53,950
Ugly and awful.

651
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:55,958
But Nath, I had the feeling
I've been there before.

652
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:58,567
Lots of people get that feeling,
Meg, even if they haven't.

653
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,858
No, this was different.

654
01:03:02,673 --> 01:03:06,800
I even seem to remember
the icehouse back against the rocks.

655
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,804
Water shimmered out
from under it...

656
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:12,268
as if it were flooded.

657
01:03:12,269 --> 01:03:15,474
- How do you know it was an icehouse?
- That's what scares me, I know it was.

658
01:03:15,475 --> 01:03:18,759
- But how did I know?
- Well, didn't you go look?

659
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,535
I didn't dare go without you.

660
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:23,741
My heart started pounding.

661
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:26,110
Are you sure you
didn't hear screams?

662
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:30,031
Yes.

663
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:35,289
I think I did.

664
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,801
I think that's why I ran,
I don't know.

665
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,910
You'd better go.

666
01:03:56,106 --> 01:03:59,358
But come back again
tomorrow night.

667
01:03:59,852 --> 01:04:02,055
Your hair tickles.

668
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:38,765
Jeannie...

669
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,172
are you all right?

670
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:46,057
Just turned out my light.

671
01:04:46,656 --> 01:04:48,589
I thought I heard
you calling for me.

672
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:54,591
No. I was just
about to go to sleep.

673
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,363
Good.

674
01:05:09,387 --> 01:05:12,112
Sleep soundly, Jeannie.

675
01:05:29,354 --> 01:05:31,678
You were in Meg's
room just now.

676
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,198
Yes, I was.

677
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:35,445
You sneaked up the tree.

678
01:05:35,722 --> 01:05:38,666
- You were there with her in the dark.
- Is there a law against me seeing her?

679
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,498
Yes, mine.

680
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:43,909
There was peace in this house until you came.
You took her into the woods.

681
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,020
- Meg went into the woods on her own.
- She wouldn't have gone if it weren't for you.

682
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,731
Her leg wouldn't have been
broken if it weren't for you.

683
01:05:48,732 --> 01:05:51,303
You've got no right to
treat her like a child.

684
01:05:51,304 --> 01:05:53,875
You caused all the
trouble you're going to.

685
01:05:53,876 --> 01:05:55,941
I don't want you here anymore.

686
01:05:55,942 --> 01:05:57,493
Get out, now!

687
01:05:57,509 --> 01:05:59,434
You don't need to
think I want this job.

688
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:02,683
- I could work for Rentons any day I like.
- Clear out.

689
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,305
Never trespass on
my property again.

690
01:06:05,306 --> 01:06:07,352
If you do, you'll get hurt.

691
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:10,877
- Is that fair warning?
- Yes, that's clear enough.

692
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:30,390
You can take one place off.

693
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:33,206
Nath's quit, he's gone
to work for Tibby's folks.

694
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:35,230
Without even saying goodbye?

695
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:37,423
But it seems they
needed him this morning.

696
01:06:37,424 --> 01:06:39,830
He said to say goodbye
to you and Meg.

697
01:06:39,831 --> 01:06:41,744
That's not like Nath.

698
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:44,276
He's a nice boy.

699
01:06:44,777 --> 01:06:47,122
What are we going
to do for help?

700
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,463
We can manage alone.

701
01:06:49,464 --> 01:06:52,854
Meg will soon be up and around
and we can manage alone.

702
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:55,759
Just you and me and...

703
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:58,264
Meg.

704
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,550
Did you quarrel with Nath?

705
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:06,133
Don't lie to me, Pete.

706
01:07:06,227 --> 01:07:08,620
Why should I
quarrel with the boy?

707
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:13,356
For the same reason you
killed Jeannie's husband.

708
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:16,341
Because you wanted
her all to yourself.

709
01:07:20,827 --> 01:07:22,719
Ellen!

710
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:25,613
Ellen!

711
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:38,511
Meg, dear.

712
01:07:40,934 --> 01:07:42,760
Nath's gone.

713
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,002
He sent you his love.

714
01:07:46,101 --> 01:07:49,878
He needed a full time job
now that school's about over.

715
01:07:55,414 --> 01:08:00,044
I was putting some dishes away and
the wall cupboard came down on my arm.

716
01:08:00,942 --> 01:08:02,811
We'll miss Nath, won't we?

717
01:08:24,754 --> 01:08:27,861
It's going to be lonesome
for you, isn't it?

718
01:08:27,959 --> 01:08:31,134
Why don't you padlock this door
and go out to the Morgans'.

719
01:08:31,223 --> 01:08:32,930
I've quit there, Mom.

720
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:35,528
I'm going to work
for the Rentons.

721
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:38,780
Well, with Tibby around,
then you won't be lonesome.

722
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,516
I'll be OK, Mom.

723
01:08:46,464 --> 01:08:49,579
Well, happy honeymoon.

724
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:53,504
Thanks again for everything.

725
01:08:53,934 --> 01:08:57,446
- Goodbye, son.
- Bye.

726
01:09:04,289 --> 01:09:07,059
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Mom.

727
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:29,934
Hello, doctor.

728
01:09:30,244 --> 01:09:33,452
How's my patient? I bet it
feels better with that cast off.

729
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:37,273
I've been cheating a little, Dr. Byrne.
I tried walking without my crutches.

730
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:40,086
Uh-huh.
I brought up the mail.

731
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:45,756
- Where's Ellen?
- Gathering the eggs.

732
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:48,593
How's everyone in the valley?

733
01:09:48,629 --> 01:09:51,437
Oh, new baby at Sheriff Hawk's.

734
01:09:51,738 --> 01:09:53,864
New hired hand at the Rentons'.

735
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:55,177
Who?

736
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:57,251
Mrs. Storm's boy, Nath.

737
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,083
Yeah.

738
01:09:59,084 --> 01:10:01,731
Everybody's wondering what the
Rentons want most,

739
01:10:01,732 --> 01:10:06,329
the Storm boy for a son-in-law or an
extra hand on the farm for free.

740
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:09,293
- Is Nath living at the Rentons'?
- No.

741
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:11,623
I see him going back
to the store nights.

742
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:16,394
Say, wasn't he working here at the time
you broke this pretty leg?

743
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:19,079
Yes, but he had to
get a full-time job.

744
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,094
He's got a full-time
job handling Tibby.

745
01:10:22,095 --> 01:10:24,499
She's a wild one.

746
01:10:24,543 --> 01:10:29,252
Well, I've got a few babies coming,
few old folks dying. I've got to be going.

747
01:10:29,253 --> 01:10:32,219
- Hiya, Pete.
- Hello, doctor.

748
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,773
Our Meg's about as good as new.
Young bones knit fast.

749
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:38,648
Yeah, well, thank heavens
she was luckier than I was.

750
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:42,911
Yes, but then a girl needs a pretty leg
more than a man does.

751
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:46,054
With a little help and being careful,
she can forget the crutches.

752
01:10:46,064 --> 01:10:48,650
Well, I'll help her,
I'll take care of her.

753
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:51,299
I'll watch her like
a Saint Bernard.

754
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:57,163
All right.

755
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:02,092
Say hello to her for me.

756
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:03,891
- I will.
- Bye bye.

757
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,595
- Bye.
- Bye.

758
01:11:12,695 --> 01:11:15,687
Remember when I had to learn to
walk again,

759
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,014
just like climbing
a mountain all day long.

760
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:22,199
Better lean on me.

761
01:11:22,498 --> 01:11:25,649
Mustn't try too
much the first time.

762
01:11:26,443 --> 01:11:28,978
I just want to help you.

763
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:31,318
That's what I'm for.

764
01:11:31,319 --> 01:11:33,522
That's what I like.

765
01:11:45,109 --> 01:11:46,754
Oh, hi.

766
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:51,737
- What you got on?
- My new play suit. Do you like it?

767
01:11:51,738 --> 01:11:53,330
It's all right.

768
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,415
You might as well still be working at the
Morgans' for all the fun you are to me.

769
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:59,945
If you'd spend a little more
time working around this place

770
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:02,639
instead of preening your
feathers like a pet canary,

771
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:05,182
maybe you'd know what it
is to be tired at night.

772
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:09,176
I had a nice Sunday picnic all planned
for us tomorrow down by the stream.

773
01:12:09,177 --> 01:12:11,344
But I'm not gonna
waste it on you.

774
01:12:11,345 --> 01:12:13,151
You sleep all day
if you want to.

775
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:15,512
Oh, just till 10:00 or 11:00.

776
01:12:15,851 --> 01:12:20,421
You didn't sleep till any 10:00 or 11:00 up at
the Morgans' because you wanted to see her.

777
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:23,681
Go stick your head under a
faucet and cool off, Tibby.

778
01:12:23,682 --> 01:12:26,335
If you want to go on that picnic
tomorrow, I'll be here till 11:00.

779
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:12,637
So you finally made
up your mind to come.

780
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:20,055
Here's your bond.

781
01:13:20,056 --> 01:13:21,869
I've been here every Sunday.

782
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:23,857
Well, I couldn't get
here before today.

783
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,984
Who do you think you
are, standing me up?

784
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,648
You've been drinking.

785
01:13:27,649 --> 01:13:28,558
So what?

786
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:32,214
Well, I'm sorry I came at all.
I'm sorry I got your old bond.

787
01:13:32,215 --> 01:13:34,625
- Did you tell anybody?
- You're drunk.

788
01:13:40,824 --> 01:13:42,458
Who are you kidding?

789
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:45,713
You can fool around with pretty boy
Nath Storm as much as you like.

790
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:48,279
But when you decide on
a man, you come to me.

791
01:13:58,245 --> 01:14:00,093
You had to catch him
when he was drunk.

792
01:14:00,094 --> 01:14:03,881
Just try it sometime when he's sober,
just once, he'd kill you.

793
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:30,541
Can't you see
you're not wanted?

794
01:14:30,636 --> 01:14:32,308
Yeah, I can.

795
01:14:32,398 --> 01:14:35,684
The next time you feel like
snooping around Ox Head Woods,

796
01:14:35,685 --> 01:14:39,172
read the signs, the part
about "at your own risk."

797
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,688
Why?

798
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:43,564
Because some yellow belly'll
sock me in the dark?

799
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,966
Because I got full
rights to them woods.

800
01:14:51,063 --> 01:14:53,976
- Who gave 'em to you?
- Pete Morgan.

801
01:14:55,009 --> 01:14:58,514
Then would you be knowing
how Meg broke her leg?

802
01:14:58,854 --> 01:15:00,940
No, I wouldn't.

803
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,230
But if it was you snooping around
these woods, you'd get this.

804
01:15:09,048 --> 01:15:11,512
Come on, Tibby,
let's get out of here.

805
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:55,355
This is the way it
could always be, Jeannie.

806
01:15:59,457 --> 01:16:01,986
We don't need anybody else.

807
01:16:13,556 --> 01:16:14,958
Meg.

808
01:16:23,831 --> 01:16:26,262
What's the matter, child?

809
01:16:26,303 --> 01:16:29,898
I don't know.
Just heartsick, I guess.

810
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:31,991
You miss Nath, don't you?

811
01:16:32,182 --> 01:16:33,715
Yes.

812
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:37,709
And something's wrong here.
I don't know what it is.

813
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,383
Wrong in what way?

814
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:44,459
Ellen, who is Jeannie?

815
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:46,453
Where did you hear that name?

816
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:50,081
Pete's called me that several times,
and when he does, I'm afraid.

817
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:52,028
When has he called
you that name?

818
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:55,577
Up in my room when my leg
was hurting, out by the pond.

819
01:16:55,674 --> 01:16:57,841
Has Pete ever
laid hands on you?

820
01:16:57,971 --> 01:16:59,438
No.

821
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:00,883
Why do you ask that?

822
01:17:05,307 --> 01:17:07,335
Finish the dishes, dear.

823
01:17:17,524 --> 01:17:20,492
- Anything wrong?
- No.

824
01:17:23,823 --> 01:17:25,814
You're working too hard, Pete.

825
01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:28,410
Why don't we get
Nath back to help?

826
01:17:29,989 --> 01:17:31,622
We're better off without him.

827
01:17:31,623 --> 01:17:33,688
I'm sure Meg misses him.

828
01:17:33,947 --> 01:17:38,778
She's young, she deserves the company
of a nice boy like Nath, a little fun.

829
01:17:40,187 --> 01:17:43,614
That's what you said
about Herb Snell years ago.

830
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:46,709
Herb Snell was fun, remember?

831
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,120
I didn't have time to
learn how to dance.

832
01:17:49,121 --> 01:17:54,529
I was too busy earning the money that would make
it possible for me to ask Jeannie to be my wife.

833
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:57,858
And Herb Snell was busy becoming
the best dancer in the valley.

834
01:17:57,859 --> 01:18:00,186
Nath's like you were, not Herb.

835
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:03,614
He's a fine boy,
honest, a hard worker.

836
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:05,979
He has a girl.
What does he want with Meg?

837
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,425
Meg needs to be with
young people like Nath.

838
01:18:08,426 --> 01:18:11,116
You can't condemn
her to loneliness.

839
01:18:11,117 --> 01:18:12,480
Meg belongs here with us.

840
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:14,520
Do you want to chain her
to this place all her life?

841
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:16,731
All my life, yes.

842
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:18,597
I've given my life to you, Pete,

843
01:18:18,598 --> 01:18:21,764
because you're my brother and
I loved you, and you needed me.

844
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:24,679
You know what it's meant
to me, what I've lost.

845
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,669
You know what Jonathan
Byrne and I might have had.

846
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:29,258
Well, did I ask you
not to marry him?

847
01:18:29,259 --> 01:18:31,324
No, but you wouldn't let me
take Meg with me if I did.

848
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:33,039
Did you expect me to?

849
01:18:33,048 --> 01:18:35,319
Whatever happiness I get,
I've got to find while I live.

850
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,710
You can find
happiness by giving it.

851
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:40,276
Well, do you think I could
find it with that boy back here?

852
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:43,566
Do you think he'd stop prowling in those
woods until he found the red house?

853
01:18:43,604 --> 01:18:46,091
He wouldn't stop at that,
he'd dig deeper.

854
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:50,289
He'd dig up a skull and
bring in home as a trophy.

855
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:52,516
What do you think
that would do to Meg?

856
01:18:52,517 --> 01:18:55,603
What do you think would happen
to her if she found out the truth?

857
01:18:55,604 --> 01:18:59,293
- She'd loathe me all the rest of her life.
- But you've got to be fair to Meg.

858
01:18:59,294 --> 01:19:01,646
All right, so I'm not fair.

859
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:03,871
But I can't let her go.

860
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,341
As long as the red house
stands in that quarry,

861
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:09,387
my whole life is Meg's
and her life is mine.

862
01:19:27,307 --> 01:19:28,774
What are you
going to do, Ellen?

863
01:19:28,775 --> 01:19:31,625
I'm going to burn that
place out of Pete's mind.

864
01:19:31,626 --> 01:19:34,980
I don't care if it starts a forest fire.
It's going up in flames tonight.

865
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:37,210
- You can't go into those woods.
- I know them well enough.

866
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:40,957
It isn't that, I didn't tell you or Nath the
whole truth about how my leg was broken.

867
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,463
I fell, but it was because
somebody was shooting at me.

868
01:19:43,464 --> 01:19:46,794
- I was afraid Nath would get shot, afraid...
- Teller.

869
01:19:46,795 --> 01:19:49,844
It's Pete's fault for letting Teller
think he owns those woods.

870
01:19:49,845 --> 01:19:52,549
He's just trying to scare
you, but he's afraid of me.

871
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,636
- Let me go with you.
- No, your leg isn't strong enough.

872
01:19:54,637 --> 01:19:56,621
I don't want to
stay here alone.

873
01:19:56,622 --> 01:19:59,490
Come with me as far as
Nath's cabin. Lock yourself in.

874
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:02,320
I'll be back before
Pete knows I'm gone.

875
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,441
Ellen?

876
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:06,344
Meg?

877
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,093
Ellen! Meg?

878
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:16,955
Ellen! Meg!

879
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:19,240
Wait here for me.

880
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,952
Meg!

881
01:21:11,384 --> 01:21:12,786
Ellen!

882
01:21:21,078 --> 01:21:23,947
All right, Nath, come up out of there.
I got you covered.

883
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:32,602
Miss Ellen.
Miss Ellen!

884
01:21:34,309 --> 01:21:36,057
I didn't aim to kill.

885
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:38,170
Miss Ellen, please.

886
01:21:38,171 --> 01:21:39,974
Ellen!

887
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:22,309
Pete! Pete!

888
01:22:23,804 --> 01:22:26,094
Pete, where are you?

889
01:22:27,897 --> 01:22:29,499
Pete!

890
01:22:31,787 --> 01:22:35,479
Didn't you hear me?
Ellen's hurt, she needs help.

891
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,883
Yes, I know.

892
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:41,832
She's bleeding,
she's been shot.

893
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:44,251
Ellen's lost now.

894
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:46,141
Lost.

895
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,955
Nothing will help.

896
01:22:48,956 --> 01:22:51,501
Pete, you're not gonna
sit here and let her die.

897
01:22:51,502 --> 01:22:53,635
She was going to the red house.

898
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:59,843
15 years those woods
have been calling to me.

899
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:01,986
Storm's store.

900
01:23:02,176 --> 01:23:03,764
It won't get me.

901
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:06,368
Nath, it's Meg.

902
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:07,924
I need help.

903
01:23:07,925 --> 01:23:10,535
He can't help.
Nobody can help.

904
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:13,140
Ellen's in the woods, hurt.
Teller shot her.

905
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:16,009
- I can't carry her out alone.
- Where is she?

906
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:19,426
On the trail we took just before
we reached the limestone rocks.

907
01:23:19,429 --> 01:23:21,221
I'll call Dr. Byrne
and the sheriff.

908
01:23:21,222 --> 01:23:23,626
- I'll bring a stretcher.
- Hurry!

909
01:23:25,765 --> 01:23:27,899
You're not going back in there,
you can't do it.

910
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,410
You'll be lost too, believe me,
I know the woods are evil.

911
01:23:30,411 --> 01:23:32,417
I know what's there,
I know the dangers.

912
01:23:32,418 --> 01:23:35,887
- Oh, darling, don't.
- Let go of me.

913
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,349
You don't know.

914
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,805
Darling, I've
stopped the bleeding.

915
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:53,351
You'll be fine now.

916
01:23:55,129 --> 01:23:57,918
You'll get everything
you need soon.

917
01:23:58,013 --> 01:23:59,621
Nath's coming.

918
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:02,140
And he's called Jonathan.

919
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,131
Jonathan.

920
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:08,435
Need him.

921
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:12,322
Does it hurt as much now?

922
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,686
Doesn't hurt now.

923
01:24:22,146 --> 01:24:23,756
Be fine.

924
01:24:28,014 --> 01:24:30,261
Pete!

925
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,847
Pity Pete.

926
01:24:34,743 --> 01:24:36,690
Pity him.

927
01:24:38,088 --> 01:24:39,732
Love him.

928
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:57,895
- How is she?
- She's asleep, I bandaged her.

929
01:24:57,995 --> 01:24:59,683
Oh, Nath, thanks.

930
01:24:59,777 --> 01:25:02,522
I made a stretcher out of a blanket
and a couple of rake handles.

931
01:25:02,523 --> 01:25:04,936
- It's all I had.
- Did you get Dr. Byrne?

932
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:08,604
He wasn't in. I left a message.
I called the sheriff.

933
01:25:09,891 --> 01:25:12,284
She's sleeping awfully sound.

934
01:25:18,594 --> 01:25:20,296
She's dead.

935
01:26:12,096 --> 01:26:14,504
What you got on your mind, me?

936
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:24,263
I couldn't get you
out of my mind, baby.

937
01:26:26,696 --> 01:26:29,570
That's the way you
are with me too.

938
01:26:29,707 --> 01:26:31,341
Let's do something about it.

939
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:34,110
Let's borrow your
father's truck and elope.

940
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:35,776
Elope?

941
01:26:35,777 --> 01:26:37,779
Holy smoke.
Pop would kill us.

942
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:39,373
Come on, baby.

943
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:42,903
We'll drive across the state line.
I'll cash in my bond.

944
01:26:43,019 --> 01:26:48,037
We'll splurge it having a honeymoon
that'll top any honeymoon anybody ever had.

945
01:26:49,278 --> 01:26:53,736
The truck's in the orchard shed, we can
head out the back road, they won't hear us.

946
01:27:06,150 --> 01:27:07,837
She hurt bad?

947
01:27:07,838 --> 01:27:09,840
She's dead.

948
01:27:29,402 --> 01:27:32,176
You think I didn't love Ellen.

949
01:27:33,408 --> 01:27:37,013
Every day for years
she's died for me.

950
01:27:38,394 --> 01:27:41,104
You think I can forget that?

951
01:27:42,901 --> 01:27:45,768
But she forgot the woods.

952
01:27:46,506 --> 01:27:48,840
That's what's killed her.

953
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:51,635
You hate me now, don't you?

954
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,244
Yes, I think I do.

955
01:27:55,558 --> 01:27:58,188
You let Ellen die.

956
01:27:58,422 --> 01:28:01,025
No, no.

957
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:04,740
You defy the woods,
and you will hurt.

958
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:07,235
She defied them,

959
01:28:07,837 --> 01:28:10,240
and she's dead.

960
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:15,104
Ellen didn't hate me.

961
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:17,416
She always understood.

962
01:28:19,831 --> 01:28:23,536
You'll leave me now, I
suppose, won't you, Meg?

963
01:28:24,077 --> 01:28:25,561
Yes.

964
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,905
Everything I love...

965
01:28:29,807 --> 01:28:31,609
dies.

966
01:28:33,971 --> 01:28:36,124
I can't lose you, Jeannie.

967
01:28:36,154 --> 01:28:38,199
Don't call me that name, Pete.

968
01:28:38,249 --> 01:28:41,564
Who was she? Who was Jeannie?
Was her real name Genevieve?

969
01:28:41,565 --> 01:28:43,629
- Was she my mother, Pete?
- I don't know.

970
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:46,815
You do know.
I can't stay here any longer.

971
01:28:46,816 --> 01:28:48,429
Yes.

972
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,475
She was your mother.

973
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,177
- Now are you happy?
- What happened to her?

974
01:28:56,178 --> 01:28:57,306
Meg, for the love of heavens...

975
01:28:57,307 --> 01:28:59,410
- She was killed, wasn't she?
- But it was an accident, I...

976
01:28:59,411 --> 01:29:02,008
It wasn't an accident.
Something awful must've happened.

977
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:05,214
- You must have hated her or...
- Hated her?

978
01:29:05,502 --> 01:29:07,787
I've worshiped your mother.

979
01:29:07,788 --> 01:29:09,560
No man ever loved a woman more.

980
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:12,462
But she married your father,
a man without heart, without soul.

981
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:16,320
- Is that why you killed her?
- No, no, no, you've got to believe me, Meg.

982
01:29:16,337 --> 01:29:18,350
I never hurt your mother.

983
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:21,366
I never even so much as
said a harsh word to her.

984
01:29:21,382 --> 01:29:23,234
And then when you were
born in the red house,

985
01:29:23,235 --> 01:29:25,640
I loved you like
you were my own.

986
01:29:25,641 --> 01:29:27,753
That's why I
remembered the house.

987
01:29:27,844 --> 01:29:30,148
It was his fault.

988
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:32,652
He got jealous.

989
01:29:32,711 --> 01:29:35,615
He took to accusing Jeannie
and me of...

990
01:29:36,217 --> 01:29:38,019
bad things.

991
01:29:38,098 --> 01:29:40,189
He lied.

992
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:42,774
But the worst was when...

993
01:29:42,775 --> 01:29:45,307
he was going to take
Jeannie and you away.

994
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:48,784
I ran to the red house, to plead
with your mother not to go.

995
01:29:48,785 --> 01:29:50,975
I heard him coming
home in the surrey.

996
01:29:50,976 --> 01:29:54,547
I begged her to decide
before it was too late.

997
01:29:55,032 --> 01:29:57,124
She got frightened.

998
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,557
I don't know why.

999
01:29:59,558 --> 01:30:01,963
She screamed.

1000
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:04,885
- There was no reason I wasn't going.
- Then you did kill her.

1001
01:30:04,886 --> 01:30:07,297
No, it was an accident,
I just tried to keep her quiet.

1002
01:30:07,298 --> 01:30:10,309
I just put my hand over
her mouth, only that.

1003
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,814
She was smothered.

1004
01:30:18,574 --> 01:30:20,877
Then he came in the door,

1005
01:30:20,878 --> 01:30:23,081
and went crazy.

1006
01:30:23,621 --> 01:30:25,924
I knew it was his fault.

1007
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:28,428
He was the one
who killed Jeannie.

1008
01:30:28,447 --> 01:30:30,352
I picked up a bullwhip,

1009
01:30:30,353 --> 01:30:31,950
and I beat him!

1010
01:30:31,951 --> 01:30:33,754
Till he wasn't
handsome anymore,

1011
01:30:33,755 --> 01:30:36,458
until he was dead, finished!

1012
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:40,121
I was out of my mind.

1013
01:30:40,122 --> 01:30:42,667
I picked up their bodies and
I put them in the surrey.

1014
01:30:42,668 --> 01:30:45,119
I whipped the horses
into the icehouse.

1015
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,410
The spring had broken
through in there.

1016
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:49,756
The mud was deep, deep enough.

1017
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:51,590
When I came to my senses, I...

1018
01:30:51,591 --> 01:30:54,736
I tried to kill myself,
I jumped into the quarry.

1019
01:30:54,964 --> 01:30:57,769
Ellen should've
let me die there.

1020
01:30:57,928 --> 01:31:00,439
Nath! Nath!

1021
01:31:00,732 --> 01:31:02,020
Nath, where are you?

1022
01:31:06,068 --> 01:31:07,460
Nath's gone.

1023
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:11,172
He's taken your rifle, he's gone
to the woods. Teller will kill him.

1024
01:31:11,727 --> 01:31:12,915
I love him, Pete.

1025
01:31:16,153 --> 01:31:18,862
I love him like you
loved Jeannie, Pete.

1026
01:31:19,157 --> 01:31:21,730
I don't know the woods at night,
Pete, you do.

1027
01:31:21,873 --> 01:31:23,762
You've got to help me stop him.

1028
01:31:23,763 --> 01:31:26,589
I'll forget what happened.
I won't hold it against you.

1029
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:30,559
You can make up for what you did. Jeannie
will forgive you, she'll forgive you, Pete.

1030
01:31:30,572 --> 01:31:32,203
I can end this?

1031
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:35,286
I can be free.

1032
01:31:37,818 --> 01:31:39,364
There was a truck
road to the red house.

1033
01:31:39,365 --> 01:31:42,738
You go ahead, start the truck.
I'll catch up with you.

1034
01:31:53,644 --> 01:31:55,255
Listen.

1035
01:31:55,759 --> 01:31:58,750
- My pop must've found out...
- I wish that's all that was.

1036
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:00,856
What do you mean?

1037
01:32:02,056 --> 01:32:04,122
They're after me.

1038
01:32:11,148 --> 01:32:15,116
- Pop'll whip me.
- Stop that crying. Stop it!

1039
01:32:21,763 --> 01:32:24,055
You don't really love me!

1040
01:32:31,836 --> 01:32:33,138
Better stop!

1041
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:37,904
I didn't know what I was doing.

1042
01:32:37,905 --> 01:32:41,496
Maybe Teller didn't either, kid,
but it all adds up to murder.

1043
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:43,192
Murder?

1044
01:33:07,205 --> 01:33:09,588
Look out, that branch!

1045
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:13,934
We can't make it this way.

1046
01:33:18,681 --> 01:33:20,225
Who's there?

1047
01:33:20,263 --> 01:33:23,929
It's Ray Hall, Nath.
I came as quickly as I could.

1048
01:33:25,169 --> 01:33:27,201
I telephoned the
state highway police.

1049
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,537
- Any signs of Teller?
- No, Sheriff.

1050
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:34,607
- But I heard a car here in the woods.
- Yeah, so did I.

1051
01:34:03,562 --> 01:34:05,131
Is Teller here?

1052
01:34:05,164 --> 01:34:06,730
Not yet.

1053
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:08,220
We're on time.

1054
01:34:29,217 --> 01:34:30,709
Come, dear.

1055
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:32,328
Don't be afraid.

1056
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:03,671
Step out of the door,
he'll see us.

1057
01:35:14,379 --> 01:35:16,452
Why must we bolt the door?

1058
01:35:49,147 --> 01:35:51,016
Nothing has changed.

1059
01:36:00,182 --> 01:36:02,051
Just as it was.

1060
01:36:08,553 --> 01:36:10,423
Just as it was.

1061
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:37,172
She's just like you, Jeannie.

1062
01:36:38,175 --> 01:36:40,539
I've come to plead
with you not to go.

1063
01:36:40,597 --> 01:36:42,509
Don't go with him, Jeannie.

1064
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:45,049
I can't live without you.

1065
01:36:45,083 --> 01:36:47,295
Pete, we've come
here to help Nath.

1066
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:49,597
- He could be killed.
- Yes!

1067
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:52,099
I'd kill to keep you here.

1068
01:36:52,393 --> 01:36:55,238
Does Herb love you that
much, enough to kill for you?

1069
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:11,779
When he comes back
to the village,

1070
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,483
we'll be gone, you
and the baby and me.

1071
01:37:13,682 --> 01:37:15,394
We'll be gone.

1072
01:37:15,398 --> 01:37:18,688
And I swear before God I'll kill him
before I'll let him take you away.

1073
01:37:18,689 --> 01:37:21,103
You stay here with me, Jeannie.

1074
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:24,036
There isn't much time left.

1075
01:37:24,037 --> 01:37:26,026
Decide, Jeannie, decide!

1076
01:37:30,465 --> 01:37:31,967
Oh, Nath!

1077
01:37:32,228 --> 01:37:33,738
Nath!

1078
01:37:36,233 --> 01:37:37,735
Meg!

1079
01:37:45,505 --> 01:37:47,297
Stop it!

1080
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,512
Open the door, Meg!

1081
01:37:50,513 --> 01:37:52,578
- Jeannie!
- Meg!

1082
01:37:52,976 --> 01:37:55,986
- Open up or I'll shoot it.
- Jeannie.

1083
01:38:08,678 --> 01:38:10,411
Meg, it's Nath.

1084
01:38:19,805 --> 01:38:21,695
Stop or I'll shoot!

1085
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:25,208
Stop, Pete!
Stop or I'll shoot!

1086
01:39:19,132 --> 01:39:22,157
I thought I better finish what Ellen
started out to do, sweetheart.

1087
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:24,387
I set fire to the red house.

1088
01:39:28,828 --> 01:39:31,399
Looking forward's much
better than looking back.
