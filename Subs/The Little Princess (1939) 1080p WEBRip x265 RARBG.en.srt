1
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,435
Why are they sending
so many soldiers daddy,

2
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:39,600
if it is only going
to be a little war.

3
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Make those southern boys take us
seriously this time, my darlilng.

4
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,440
When they realize how much we want to put a
stop to their nonsense, they'll quiet down.

5
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,600
They'd better. Anyhow, when you get
there, you'll stop them won't you daddy?

6
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,400
I'll do my best dear.

7
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
We will miss you so.

8
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,600
I'll be back and we'll be together
again before you can say knife.

9
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I can say knife a good many times
in a year.

10
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,976
At school, you'll have charming little
girls to play with.....

11
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,800
books to read, a pony to ride and
after all there will be Emily you know.

12
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,519
Yes, there will be Emily.
And she does look as though

13
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,624
she'd be an understanding
friend, don't you think daddy?

14
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
With that intelletual look, I'm sure of it.

15
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,802
- Not a very cheeful looking
school, is it daddy? - I'm

16
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:57,225
afraid nothing would seem very
cheerful to us at the moment.

17
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
Well, maybe it will be
better on the inside.

18
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,600
- Of course it will. I'm sorry sir.
- All right, get it out.

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,477
- The very idea of
delivering a thing like this

20
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,824
to the front door.
- Oh look daddy, my pony.

21
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Your employer will answer to this.
Now take him away. Yes, far away!

22
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,400
- Oh no daddy.
- Oh, I say. Just a moment.

23
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
- You are Miss Minchin?
- I am.

24
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm Captain Crew.

25
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,658
I'm afraid of caused you
no end to inconvenience.

26
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,624
You most certainly
have, Captain Crew.

27
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
- May I step inside and explain?
- Come in.

28
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
- Wait here, I'm returning.
- Very well Captain.

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,759
- I'm terribly sorry. I had no
intention of having the pony delivered

30
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,464
inside your house. - There are a
number of things besides the pony.

31
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,200
Parcels have been arriving here collect for
your daughter for hours. Follow me please.

32
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,848
Apparently you are not
aware, Captain Crew, that I

33
00:04:57,873 --> 00:05:00,624
conduct one of the most
exclusive schools in London.

34
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,903
Yes, yes, I understood.
That is precisely the

35
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,624
reason why I brought
my daughter to you.

36
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,957
I would not have gathered
that, by your actions.

37
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,224
Really now,
I'm not entirely to blame.

38
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,662
You see Sara and I,
only just arrived from India.

39
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,624
Sara has lived there
practically all her life.

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,154
We no more than got here,
when I learned that my regiment was

41
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:19,376
to leave at once for South Africa,
so we had to act in a hurry.

42
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,528
But I wrote you and explained
that l do not take young

43
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,624
ladies without an interview
and impecable references.

44
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,200
I wrote you also, that at the
moment, I have no vacant room.

45
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,400
- Well in that case daddy, we may as
well move on. - This is a bit awkward.

46
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,374
You see, your letter never
reached me and I'm afraid it never

47
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,624
occured to me that any school
wouldn't welcome my little Sara.

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,250
If it is a question of my
social standing, my father

49
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,824
was Sir George Crew.
You've heard of him, perhaps?

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,941
And the best financial
references l can give you would

51
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,144
be the director of the South
African Holding Syndicate.

52
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,240
I'm the principal stockholder in the
syndicate.

53
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,000
My brother, Captain Crew, a
professor of dramatics.

54
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,000
- How do you do?
- Charmed, I'm sure.

55
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,259
- I say, isn't the
Eclipse Diamond mines one

56
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,224
of your holdings?
- One of the most important.

57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,779
I'm sorry to appear casual Miss
Minchin, but the siutation is

58
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,424
quite distressing. I sail in an
hour to the east Indian docks.

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,902
I expect you'll just have to
take me to Africa with you daddy.

60
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:21,224
Well, well and what would a
little girl like you do in Africa?

61
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,467
Forgive me Captain Crew.
I'm afraid I've been over zealous. The

62
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,224
reputation of my school you know.
One has to be so cautious.

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
But after this interview, I can see at
a glance, she's a dear little child.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
- It'll be a pleasure to have her with us.
- Does that mean I've got to stay?

65
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Yes dear. You are to have that
privilege. You and your little pony.

66
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
- What a dear little pony.
- This is made out

67
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,024
to the school.
- Is it enough for the moment.

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,400
- Oh quite. - I should say it
would. Why it's stupendous.

69
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,542
- I beg your pardon,
but haven't I seen you

70
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,624
somewhere before?
- Quite possible my dear Captain.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,361
Your face is most familiar.
Were you ever on the stage? I

72
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,624
seem to associate you with
one of the old music halls.

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,089
Musicals? My brother on the stage?
Ridiculous.

74
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,024
Ridiculous indeed,
you're quite right.

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,200
And now, shall we look at little
Sara's room?

76
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Just a moment Miss Rose. This is
Miss Rose, one of my most capable teachers.

77
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,400
Captain Crew has done us the honor of
placing his little daughter Sara with us.

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,840
How do you do Miss Rose?
How do you do Captain Crew? We

79
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:25,776
shall do everything we can to
make your little girl happy.

80
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,200
Children, we have a new pupil.
Sara Crew. Say how do you do to her.

81
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
- How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Lavina, Jesse, that will do. You
may proceed Miss Rose.

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,800
- She's just like a little princess, isn't
she? - That's what she is, a princess.

84
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,800
I expect now, some people around
here won't think they're so smart.

85
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Oh won't they? Wait and see!
Princess indeed!

86
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Fortunately, the room has just been papered
and the fireplace has an excellent draft.

87
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,338
- But I thought you
didn't have any rooms? - I

88
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:14,224
didn't know then what a
dear little girl was coming.

89
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,800
Why does that make more rooms daddy?

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Lady Bengiglis daughter has only recently
vacated the room. Our best suite of course.

91
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,400
Do you think you could brighten it up a
bit? I'd like it made as gay as possible.

92
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,400
Brought a few things from India. Perhaps
you could buy whatever else is necessary.

93
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
With pleasure Captain Crew.

94
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,215
- I'd like Sara to ride every
afternoon, if that is all right.

95
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,624
Of course. - Fortunately we
have a splendid riding master.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
I expect you think I am
completely spoiling the child.

97
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:50,624
No doubt you're right,
but actually it's good for her.

98
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,500
She's much too inclined to
bury her cute little nose in a

99
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,824
book and keep it there until
someone lures her out of it.

100
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,106
You see Miss Minchin.
Sara has no mother and we've

101
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,624
never been separated for
more than a few days.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,200
- How touching.
- This is going to be very hard for her.

103
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Have no fear Captain Crew. I'm a
mother to all my little girls.

104
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,800
And now, I'll leave you to your farewells.

105
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,000
- How much longer have we got, daddy?
- Only a few minutes, darling.

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,800
- You know me by heart little Sara.
- No daddy, I know you by heart.

107
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
You're inside my heart.

108
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
We're going to be brave, aren't we?

109
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll tell you what. Let's pretend we're
back in India.

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I'm going away with the troop
for a few days. Shall we?

111
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,765
We've fought this kind
of battle before, haven't

112
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,824
we? And you never cried
once when I went away.

113
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,400
- Remember?
- Yes daddy.

114
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,600
But this is going to be our hardest
battle.

115
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,000
- But we'll be good soldiers, won't we?
- Yes daddy.

116
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
- Shall we say good-bye,
like we used to at home? - Yes daddy.

117
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,400
All right then. Chin up, go to the
window and look out.

118
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,400
Say it as we used to.

119
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,400
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

120
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Any moment, I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

121
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,800
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

122
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,400
I can't do it this time. I can't do it.

123
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,368
- You're crying too.
- I'm afraid that we

124
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:46,424
aren't quite the good
soldiers as we thought.

125
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,600
Oh yes we are.

126
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
I can do it now.

127
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,400
My daddy has to go away, but he'll
return most any day.

128
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Any moment I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

129
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,600
I will do it! I will! I'll pretend this is
part of a war.

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,600
You be the enemy and you'll be my
trusty lance. Now ready, aim, fi re.

131
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,400
I guess we'll have to call in the
reserves.

132
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,200
- Good-morning.
- Misses speaks Hindu?

133
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,000
I've lived in India all my life.

134
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
Misses is going to live in England now?

135
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,418
- Until my father gets
through with making the

136
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:21,424
boars behave.
- Your father is a soldier?

137
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Yes, my father is a captain. Captain
Crew. I'm Sara. What is your name?

138
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,400
I am Ram Dass. Servant to the
Honorable Lord Wickham and Lady Surani.

139
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Ram Dass!

140
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Why are you doddling here? Finish
with that bird and get on with your work.

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
Good-morning.

142
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
How do you do?

143
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,544
I'm up here at the window
almost every morning,

144
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,424
in case you want to
talk about India.

145
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,999
Good-morning Sara. Oh, good-morning.
Are you ready for breakfast my dear?

146
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,236
Well, I'm trying to be,
but I don't seem to be very

147
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,624
good at these buttons.
My thumb get lost in the holes.

148
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,600
Here, let me help you. Buttons are
a bother, aren't they?

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,200
I've never had to button things
before, but I'll learn.

150
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Here, put your shoe up. Come in.

151
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,200
- Good-morning Becky.
- Good-morning.

152
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,306
- Has the young lady any boots to be done?
- Well,

153
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,824
only the pair I wore
yesterday, I'll get them.

154
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
I'll get them Miss. Oh I beg your
pardon Miss!

155
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,200
- Are you hurt?
- No Miss you mustn't be helping me Miss.

156
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,568
Just hold out your arms
and I'll pile them on.

157
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:44,624
Oh no Miss.
If Miss Minchin was to see.....

158
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,400
- Think you can hold two more?
- Yes Miss.

159
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
There. There we are. Are you all right?

160
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,200
- You take care of all those?
- And she does them beautifully.

161
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,600
- I thank you Miss.
- Thank-you for doing my shoes.

162
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,000
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

163
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
Good-bye Becky. Good-bye.

164
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,004
Well, perhaps this isn't
going to be such a bad

165
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,824
school after all.
With you and Becky here.

166
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,120
Oh, we'll have to hurry dear. Miss
Minchin doesn't like anyone to be late.

167
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,800
Tell me Miss Rose. Do you think Miss
Minchin could be as cross as she looks?

168
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,600
- What will I have to do today?
- Well, after

169
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,024
breakfast,
you'll have a class of arithmatic.

170
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,000
Then English, then french, history
and geography.

171
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,800
I'm going to be a busy person,
aren't I? When do I get to ride my pony?

172
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,600
Later this afternoon. About 4 o'clock.

173
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Children, our new pupil, Sara Crew
will be down shortly.

174
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,966
As you've seen,
Captain Crew is a very delightful

175
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:55,424
man and their family
is most distinguished.

176
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,200
I should expect you to treat her
accordingly. Now you may take your places.

177
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,400
- Good-morning.
- Ah, good-morning Sara.

178
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,284
- I'm so happy you feel like
joining us this morning.

179
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,424
Did you sleep well?
- No I didn't, thank-you.

180
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Lavina, you and Jesse will move
down one place.

181
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,988
- Sara will be seated at
my right after this. - Why

182
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,424
Miss Minchin,
this has always been my place.

183
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,547
For this food,
and all thy bountiful gifts bestowed

184
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:38,424
upon us, we are duly grateful
and do now give thanks.

185
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,924
- Why are you putting salt
on your plate my dear. - Just

186
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,624
in case you plan on asking
me to have one of your eggs.

187
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,722
- Mr. Geoffrey. Shall I saddle
the pony for the wee lassie? - I

188
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:10,224
think not Sandy. We'd best use the
mare for her first few lessons.

189
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,200
What luck. The old girl allowed you
to come out.

190
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,400
Sara, this is Mr. Geoffrey Hamilton.
Miss Crew is our new pupil.

191
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,200
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

192
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I believe I am to teach you to ride.
And that means two bob extra to me.

193
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,000
- Is two bob a great deal of money?
- Values are comparative.

194
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,751
- In my present state, it's a fortune.
- Well,

195
00:17:42,776 --> 00:17:45,024
in that case,
I guess I'd better be taught.

196
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
- Is my pony ready? -I think we'd best
start you off on something a little tamer.

197
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,800
Then hadn't I better explain things
to my pony. He might feel hurt.

198
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,146
Right you are. Ponies are very
sensitive creatures. Explain the

199
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:02,024
whole thing to him, thoroughly.
He's right there by the arch.

200
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,825
It may take me some time.
That's all right.

201
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,024
We'll wait right
here in the tac room.

202
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Hello General.

203
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,000
Are you glad to see me?

204
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,577
Well if Mr. Geoffrey is going
to give me something tamer

205
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,224
than you, I'm afraid it's not
going to be much of a ride.

206
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,050
- Rose something's wrong. What is it?
- Miss

207
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,424
Minchin is taking away
my Thursday afternoons.

208
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
- But why?
- We must have been seen together.

209
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,270
- Well does that mean that I can
never see you alone again? Of course

210
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:41,424
not darling. - No matter what Miss
Minchin says, we'll find a way.

211
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,634
I can't understand the woman.
What is she

212
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:45,624
afraid of?
Why shouldn't we see one another.

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,254
Gossip I suppose.
She only lives for that school

214
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,624
the variety of the propriety
of the snobbisheness.

215
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,407
Fiddlesticks. She's afraid of losing
an excellent teacher whom she gets

216
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,976
for nothing. I won't stand for it.
I will have a talk with her myself.

217
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,400
No darling you mustn't do that.
She'd only discharge us both.

218
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,600
She may not have the chance if
things continue to pop in South Africa.

219
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,400
- You mean you might go? - Wouldn't you
want me to if they call for volunteers?

220
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
Of course darling you'd have to.

221
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,200
There is nothing to worry about now. This
poor rumpous will never get that serious.

222
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
I expect I'll have to make my visit a
little longer.

223
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,420
- Oh Mr. Brady is there
one this morning for the

224
00:19:49,445 --> 00:19:52,224
little princess?
- We'll see my child we shall see.

225
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,442
Of she don't hear from
her father every so often

226
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:58,424
her eyes get that sad it
hurts me to look in them.

227
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,798
- Have no fear little one.
- There is a letter

228
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:04,024
for her this time.
Oh i'm so glad sir.

229
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
- A letter?
- It's from my daddy.

230
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,000
- Oh how nice.
- But it isn't.

231
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,200
- It's very bad news. Really?
- What's the matter dear?

232
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,747
He says the boys are not
behaving as expeted. And

233
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:37,424
he may not get here in
time for my birthday.

234
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,600
But that's months old. So many things may
happen before then. He can still come.

235
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,872
I'm writing Miss Minchin
to give you ar bithday

236
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:50,624
party such as I should
give you if I were there.

237
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You are to go on a regular spree. Buy
anything and everthing your heart desires.

238
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,400
Now last and most important of all
my darling....

239
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,600
I want you to pause at exactly 2
o'clock on your birthday..

240
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,600
..close your eyes and send me a kiss.

241
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:19,000
For my eyes also will also be closed
and I'll be giving you a kiss too.

242
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,600
Isn't he the most wonderful man in
all the world?

243
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,600
- With one exception...
- Well Mr. Geoffrey is very nice.

244
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
What's that?

245
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,400
- Who are they Miss Rose?
- They are volunteers.

246
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,747
- Are they going to South Africa too?
- Yes dear,

247
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:08,624
they're going to relieve our
poor soldiers in Maefking.

248
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,041
- Is there something the
matter with our soldiers

249
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,024
in Mafeking?
- The boars have them all cut off.

250
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,600
We were unable to break through
their lines and ger help to them.

251
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,941
They're sick and hungry
dear and desprate.

252
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:23,024
They're holding out like
true British soldiers.

253
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,400
Miss Rose my daddy's at Mafeking.

254
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh darling I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

255
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Darling you mustn't cry. I'm sure
he'll be all right.

256
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,856
- Good afternoon Mr. Geoffery.
- Good afternoon

257
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:03,504
Madris.
Is Miss Sarah ready for her ride?

258
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
She'll be down presently. Thanks.

259
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
Oh, are we all ready?

260
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,400
The two most beautiful ladies in the world.
Why aren't you in your riding things?

261
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,809
- Oh i can't go today.
Ermegard needs extra

262
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,024
tutoring today.
- Oh will it take all afternoon?

263
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm afraid so.

264
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,537
- I have to stay with
her until she can spell

265
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:26,624
Constantiniopel.
- Heavens that may take months.

266
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,600
You leave that to me.

267
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,200
Shall we go? Have you been
crying?

268
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,600
- But you have, there are still tears in
your eyes. - It's just this London fog.

269
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Oh well if that's all,
lets be off shall we?

270
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,875
- Mr. Geoffrey.
Would you mind very much if we didn't

271
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,624
ride today?
- Not at all dear. But may I ask why not?

272
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,400
I'd like to talk to you.

273
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,157
It's about Mafeking.
Are the soldiers really

274
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:10,624
starving,
sickand cut off from everything?

275
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,000
- You see my father's there so I've got
to know. - Oh it's not as bad as all that.

276
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,282
They may not be having an
easy time of that, but they're

277
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:21,224
holding out. We're sending in
fresh troops everyday you know?

278
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,063
- Why they'll be leaving Mafeking
in no time at all. - It's

279
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:28,024
getting harder everyday to
pretend my father is safe.

280
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Don't you worry. See here, I'll let
you in on at litle secret.

281
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,964
I enlisted today and while I
don't Miss Rose to know quite

282
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:38,424
yet, I'll be going over
there quite shortly myself.

283
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,400
- To Mafeking? Well then perhaps you
can help my father. - We'll get him out.

284
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,600
What the blazes are you doing
here? Answer me! What are you doing here?

285
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,786
- Don't be frightened Sara,
it's only my grandfather. - Don't you

286
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:56,176
believe him young woman.
I disowned him the day he was born.

287
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,305
- We're really very fond of each other.
Of course

288
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,224
we are.
- What?! We are nothing of the kind.

289
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,752
- As a favor to me,
will you please stop shouting at my best

290
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:06,824
paying pupil. - Pupil? Paying?
What are you talking about?

291
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
I am master of the horse in this
exclusive seminary of the young ladies.

292
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,174
You take advantage of
my absence to become a

293
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,624
riding master?
And next door to me own house?

294
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,253
- Where's your family pride boy?
- Well sir, one

295
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,624
must eat, and family pride
is a pretty thin diet.

296
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,156
Oh, blackmail eh?
You'll think I'll buy you off?

297
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:27,824
I hadn't thought of that,
but it's not a bad idea.

298
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,100
I'll see you hang drawn and
quartered for that. Wait till I see

299
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,024
the woman who runs this school.
I'll put a spoke in your wheel.

300
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,748
Do! She loved to know
that my grandfather is

301
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:38,824
Lord Wickham.
She probably raise my salary

302
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
- Miss Sara, Lord Wickham is coming.
- Then I'm going.

303
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,000
Insolent young pup! Just like his
father. Riding master! Bah!

304
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
- Maybe you're fond of him,
but I don't think he's very fond

305
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:56,824
of you. - Oh he's harmless.
His bark is worse than his bite.

306
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,000
I should hope so. Why is he so mad at you?

307
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Oh he isn't really. He was angry with my
father. I'm mixed up in their quarrel.

308
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,842
What he really wants if for
me to come begging to him

309
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,024
for help. He'd be eating
out of my hand if I would.

310
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
I don't think I'd care for him eating
out of my hand.

311
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,976
- How would you like to
have me eating out of

312
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,224
your hand?
- You? Oh, that would be different.

313
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,800
Well I shall, if you do me a favor.
A very important one. Oh, could I?

314
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,800
I've got an idea that you are the
only one in the world who could.

315
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,400
I want you to get Miss Rose to go shopping
with you next Wednesday. Shopping?

316
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
Well, shopping is as good an
excuse for Miss Minchin.

317
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Really? To Miss Rose?

318
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,200
And she said she would? Oh, that's
wonderful!

319
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,200
- No, not a soul. Not even Emily.
- Good girl! Now we've got to go.

320
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,373
- I must do some prelimanary shopping.
- You don't

321
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,224
have to tell me what for.
Something gold and shiny.

322
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,400
Right you are!

323
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Come in.

324
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,600
- Come in. - Miss Minchin,
I wanted to ask you something.

325
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,800
- Oh, it's you. What do you want dear?
- I'm going to ask you a big favor. Yes?

326
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Mr. Geoffrey leaving today for the
war, he's been so very nice to me...

327
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,533
I thought I ought to fill my
social obligations by doing

328
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,224
something nice for him.
That's what you teach us, isn't it?

329
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,200
When someone shows you a
kindness, you show them one in return.

330
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,561
Well doing something for Mr. Geoffrey,
scarcely

331
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:44,424
comes under the rules
of social obligations.

332
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,800
- But what is it that you want to do
for him? - May I have him for tea?

333
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,600
- Here? At the school? - Oh couldn't I
please? Since he's going away to war.

334
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,382
Well I suppose it would be for him,
since he was one of the teachers.

335
00:28:57,407 --> 00:29:00,224
You need not mention this to
the other young ladies, however.

336
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,600
No Miss Minchin. Thank-you Miss
Minchin. Oh Thank-you Miss Minchin!

337
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,556
- We must eat something
after all the trouble little

338
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,024
Sara has gone to.
- I think she'll understand.

339
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,400
- You've forgotten your ring.
- No I haven't....see?

340
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,413
I'm always afraid I'll forget and
wear it in front of Miss Minchin.

341
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:44,224
I did yesterday and fortunately for
us, she didn't see it.

342
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,200
- Oh I'd love to tell the old girl.
- Can't do that yet darling. I know.

343
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,000
- Are you sorry you married me?
- As if you didn't know.

344
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I only wanted you to tell me again.
Oh, my darling....

345
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,600
I'll be living this last week over
every moment I'm away from you.

346
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,800
We won't be separated, will we?
Because I'll be living it over too.

347
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,200
- I thought you were having Mr. Hamiliton
to tea? - I am, I mean I was but.....

348
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,600
- Who's in that room?
- Oh please don't go in there Miss Minchin.

349
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
- Miss Minchin, Miss Rose and I.....
- We were saying good-bye Miss Minchin.

350
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,912
How dare you risk the reputation
of my school in this manner.

351
00:30:40,937 --> 00:30:44,224
Nothing has happened to damage
your precious school's reputation.

352
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,800
- As a matter of fact Miss Rose and I.....
- Geoffrey! For my sake.

353
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,800
- Oh please Miss Minchin, it was all
my fault. -Silence!

354
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,000
Since you are here to merely say
good-bye, please do so, now.

355
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Good-bye Geoffrey.

356
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,200
- Good-bye Mr. Geoffrey.
- Good-bye dear.

357
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,400
- Sara, I shall expect an explanation
of this. - Yes Miss Minchin.

358
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,000
As soon as I can think of one.

359
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,999
- They've been cornered like
rats for 7 months. - I say send

360
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,304
more troops to Mafeking if it
takes every man in England.

361
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,200
- I'm with you.
- No! Nooooooooo!

362
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,200
Oh my boy, my boy, my boooooy....

363
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
They killed my boy.

364
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,400
I know soldiers are suppose to
stand a lot and my daddy is a good soldier.

365
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,800
But they've waited so long for help. Please
do something about Mafeking right away.

366
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Or they'll all be lost and my daddy
won't come back.

367
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,600
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is
set free.

368
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,800
Mafeking is set free. Mafeking is
set free.

369
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,800
Oh thank-you for being so quick
about it this time.

370
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,800
Get up, get up! Mafeking is set free.

371
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,600
Wake up everybody! Mafeking is
set free.

372
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,452
- Oh Mr. Bertie! Did you hear?
Mafeking is set

373
00:33:12,477 --> 00:33:15,024
free!
- Yes darling, isn't it great news.

374
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,800
Oh Miss Rose, they're saved. My
daddy and Mr. Geoffrey are saved.

375
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,953
- What's wrong? Nothing is wrong.
- Nothing,

376
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:26,424
nothing, nothing!
Mafeking is set free.

377
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,600
Oh Miss Minchin, isn't it wonderful?
Can you hear the cheering?

378
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
- Oh Sara, I'm so glad for you.
- He's saved Becky! My daddy is saved!

379
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,000
Children, children! Attention please!

380
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,650
It is a happy circumstance that
Sara's birthday should fall on a day

381
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:35,024
that we are celebrating a glorious
victory for Her Majesty's Army.

382
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,800
Now Sara. Will you explain to the children
about your wishes for your birthday?

383
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,653
I'm very happy to have you
here and I thought I would

384
00:34:43,678 --> 00:34:46,424
like to give presents today.
Not just receive them.

385
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,600
I want to show how grateful I am my father
has been rescued. Quiet children, quiet.

386
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,200
- Can we do the presents now?
- Yes, but your gift first Sara.

387
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,660
This is for you.
Oh thank-you Miss Minchin.

388
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,224
Now all I need is
to know how to sew.

389
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,600
And this from the entire school.
Here are pictures of your native India.

390
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,468
Oh thank-you ever and ever so much.
I shouldn't have to

391
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:18,224
pretend nearly so hard when I
want to make believe I'm there.

392
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,035
And now, would you like
them to have their presents.

393
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,624
Yes, if you please.
And your names are all on them.

394
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,600
Here you are Miss Rose. Oh, how nice.
Now would you help with the other presents?

395
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,701
- Here you are Miss Rose.
Oh, how nice. Now would you

396
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,904
help with the other presents?
- Oh how thoughtful Sara.

397
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,335
From one old trooper to another.
Me in younger and

398
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,824
happier days.
I was better known as Bobbling Bertie.

399
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,800
- Thank-you. We'd better keep this
present a secret. - Mums the word.

400
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,800
- Here this is from me. I hope you like it.
- It's just what I wanted.

401
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,600
Mums the word you know.

402
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Here's my present Miss. Many
Happy Returns.

403
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:27,800
- Oh thank-you Becky.
- The material isn't new.

404
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,800
- Why you dear Becky, you made it all
yourself. - Yes Miss. I made it at nights.

405
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,600
I knew you could pretend, I said,
with diamond pins stuck in.

406
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,364
- It's beautiful Becky,
I shall love it. Oh

407
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:46,624
will you Miss?
- The material isn't all new.

408
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,200
- And this isn't so very new either.
- It's my present to you.

409
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,000
- Yes Becky, with my love.
- What is it Miss?

410
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,400
It's a scarab from Egypt. My daddy
gave it to me, because it brings good luck.

411
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,200
I'd rather you had it, than anyone
else I know.

412
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,400
- Oh my Miss. I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh no Becky! Not now.

413
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,000
I have lots more presents for you.
Two in my room.

414
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,800
- I don't know what to say Miss.
- You're sweet Becky.

415
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
Yes, yes, very nice.

416
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,263
- eg your pardon Miss. Yes?
Mr. Barrow of Barrow and

417
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,584
Skippo is here to see you.
- Today? I didn't send for him.

418
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,200
He seems very much upset about
something. He's waiting in your office.

419
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,400
- Miss Rose.
- The scarf is beautiful.

420
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,200
Miss Rose, remember to be sure
and tell me when it's almost 2 o'clock.

421
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,474
You know, I have a very
special appointment with my

422
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:47,224
daddy. He's going to be
thinking of me at exactly 2.

423
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,862
I'll watch the time.
Thank-you Miss Rose.

424
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:53,224
Oh Sara! Thank-you for the
handkerchiefs, they're lovely.

425
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,400
- Don't you think it's time to
cut the cake? - Oh yes, the cake!

426
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,951
- Please be seated Mr. Barrow.
- How much did you

427
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:03,424
advance for this party?
Quite a sum, I suspect.

428
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,679
What does it matter.
Captain Crew is a very

429
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:07,624
wealthy man.
His check will be here shortly.

430
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,400
- No Miss Minchin. There'll be no check.
- What? What do you mean by that?

431
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,600
The late Captain Crew..... The
"late" Captain Crew?!

432
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,060
Captain Crew is dead.
He was so reported in the

433
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:22,824
list this morning.
Moreover, he died bankrupt

434
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,010
- Bankrupt?! But his property, his mines.
- His

435
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:29,024
property and mines were
confiscated by the enemy.

436
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,083
You mean to tell me that
that child is penniless?

437
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:34,024
That she's left on my
hands with nothing?

438
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,600
She's certainly left penniless and
she's certainly left on your hands.

439
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,411
- She hasn't a relative
in the world that we know

440
00:38:40,436 --> 00:38:42,424
of. - But her father's
account is overdrawn.

441
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,600
I was expecting a check, and advanced the
money for this party. So I understand.

442
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,200
Now you have to make a wish and
blow out all the candles with one breath.

443
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,200
My wish is that my father will come
back real soon.

444
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Now take a big breath.

445
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
I haven't got very good lungs, have I?

446
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,738
- I'll turn her out on the
streets -Do you think that's

447
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:11,704
wise Miss Minchin.
The reputation of your school.

448
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,400
My school?

449
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,122
Well the report might get
about and it might not

450
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,224
sound well to the parents
of your other pupils.

451
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Yes, that is so.

452
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,413
Of course, the child can
be made to serve in your

453
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:25,024
employ, until her
indebtedness is worked out.

454
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,400
- But that will take years. - Quite so,
but at least it is better than nothing.

455
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,200
Hurry children, your ice-cream is melting.

456
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,000
- Tara, it's almost 2 o'clock darling.
- Thank-you Miss Rose.

457
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Oh daddy, I'm thinking of you.

458
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,600
And I know, wherever you are,
you're thinking of me too.

459
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh Miss Rose. I felt him with me,
I really did!

460
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Miss Minchin wants you dear. Oh,
all right.

461
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,640
- Children, you will leave your gifts here.
- Why? Where are they going?

462
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
- Why can't they take the presents with
them? - Because they are not yours to give.

463
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,000
- But I don't understand.
- You will later. Go to your room now.

464
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,200
- But Miss Minchin.
- Sara, go to your room.

465
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
All of you.

466
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,571
Now will you tell her what it's all about?
What has happened Miss

467
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,976
Minchin? Whatever it is,
you may want to let her off a bit easier.

468
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,200
Silence! Captain Crew is dead. His
name appeared on the list today.

469
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,000
He left the child a pauper. Oh Miss
Minchin. You had better tell her.

470
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,400
- Oh, I couldn't do that.
- You will do as you are told.

471
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Oh Miss Rose. What's wrong?
Why did Miss Minchin stop the party?

472
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,200
Sara, I want to talk to you dear.

473
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
- Oh darling........
- Oh Miss Rose! What is it?

474
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,800
Sara, you're a soldier's daughter.....

475
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,651
and you know that
means being brave and

476
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:59,024
courageous, don't you?
No matter what happens.

477
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:06,000
- Oh Miss Rose! Is it something awful?
- Your father.....

478
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,400
But my father is all right. Mafeking
is set free. You heard them say so.

479
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,477
Help didn't get there soon enough
dear, for him.

480
00:42:16,502 --> 00:42:19,624
His name appeared on
the list this morning.

481
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,600
- You mean with the wounded?
- No dear.

482
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,600
My daddy is...

483
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh Sara, I'm so sorry.

484
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,600
It can't be! It isn't true! I won't
believe it! He isn't dead! He isn't!

485
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,600
- Have you?
- Yes.

486
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,600
You may go.

487
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,000
You may go.

488
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,800
Come with me.

489
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,000
This is to be your room in the future.

490
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,323
I shall have to sell your
furnishings and clothes,

491
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:17,424
to pay part of the
debt your father owes.

492
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,385
Ordinarily,
you would go to a charitable

493
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,624
institution,
but I'm going to let you remain here.

494
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,000
There will be duties for you to
perform, of course.

495
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,800
I hope you appreciate my kindness
in not sending you away.

496
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,946
I was unable to fi nd a
black dress among your

497
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,624
things, but one of the
girls has given you this.

498
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,600
You'd better take off that party frock
and put this on.

499
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,200
I'll send up some shoes.

500
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,400
I don't believe it. I don't, I don't!

501
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,200
My daddy has to go away. But he'll
return most any day.

502
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,800
Any moment I may see, my daddy
coming back to me.

503
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,600
And Miss Minchin is going to sell all
her things.

504
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,227
It was beastly having to
give back all our presents.

505
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:54,024
How do you feel now
about your little Princess?

506
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,800
- Oh Miss. Is there anything I can do?
- No Becky, but thank-you.

507
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,200
Sara, I'm sorry.

508
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,342
Sara, from now on,
you are not to sit with us.

509
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,224
Return to your room and
smooth down those curls.

510
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,600
And then go to the kitchen. Run
along now.

511
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,200
Lavina, you may take your old
place, beside me.

512
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,800
- Mrs. O'Connel. - Oh, so the Misses
has sent you down to me, has she?

513
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,381
- Miss Minchin said that I am to
have my breakfast here. - You'll

514
00:46:59,406 --> 00:47:02,024
do more than eat your breakfast
if you work for that one.

515
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,000
- I should be glad to help.
- You will eh?

516
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,600
Look at you! Look what you're
doing! For that you'll get no breakfast.

517
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,200
Min, you'd better make some more
toast for the Misses. Right.

518
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,200
Here's your breakfast. Take it over
there. We don't associate with royality.

519
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,229
- Let me wait on you Miss. No you don't.
- She can

520
00:47:25,254 --> 00:47:27,824
wait on herself.
You can sit there and watch her eat.

521
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,800
Perhaps that will teach you a leson.

522
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,947
Please Mrs. O'Connel.
May I give my breakfast

523
00:47:38,972 --> 00:47:41,024
to Becky?
I'm not that hungry this morning.

524
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,200
Give it to the cat if you like. Then
get to work and wash them dishes.

525
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,400
No Miss, I don't want it.

526
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,200
The mail just came.

527
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,400
The mail just came.

528
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,376
My darling girl.
I have been half mad trying to

529
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:44,624
find a way out of you since
your letter reached me.

530
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,400
But it has come! My grandfather
has relented.

531
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,672
I pray him,
that this money and my love will

532
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:56,224
help you bear what lies ahead.
Geoffrey.

533
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,998
You say this girl's a
teacher at your school?

534
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,824
She was,
until I discharged her today.

535
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,800
We're not likely to hear from her again.

536
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,600
And I was prepared to turn over a
handsome sum to that boy when he got back.

537
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,400
I even made an ass of myself and
sent him a check.

538
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,400
Then I was right to withhold this.
He made it over to her.

539
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,200
- You're not very fond of the girl,
are you? - Hardly, under the circumstances.

540
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,656
- Are you sure the girl
has no legitimate claims

541
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:32,424
on him?
- I brought her up from a fondling.

542
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,600
Is it likely, she would not have consulted
me if their love had been respectable.

543
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,000
Ram Dass!

544
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,482
Yes sir? In future if any
letters or cables come

545
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:51,624
from Mr. Geoffrey,
they're to be returned, unopened.

546
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,400
As you wish sahib.

547
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Come in Becky.

548
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,800
I'm glad you weren't asleep Miss.
It's one of the lonely nights.

549
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,600
I wonder where Miss Rose is?
I shall miss her terribly.

550
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,563
We're all alone in the world
now, aren't we Miss?

551
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:32,024
No, no, we're not alone.
There is my father you know.

552
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,108
- Your father? But cook said he......
- You

553
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:39,824
mustn't say that.
It isn't true. He's not dead.

554
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,800
He sick or wounded somewhere, or
he'd send for me. But he's not dead.

555
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,000
- How do you know Miss?
- Something inside tells me so.

556
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,400
And sometimes I hear him calling for me.

557
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,800
All alone Miss.

558
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
- Buford! You're smoking!
- As you see.

559
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,874
- Today my good woman,
the British army is behind

560
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:16,024
me. - That uniform?
You're not going to war.

561
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,153
Quite! To the very cannon's
mouth, if need be. But why?

562
00:51:19,178 --> 00:51:22,224
Because old girl. I've had it
to the teeth with your bulling.

563
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,379
And your treatment of Rose and
little Sara is the last straw.

564
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:27,824
I prefer the less painful
horrors of the battlefield.

565
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,400
- Are you daring to critize me?
- Astonishing, isn't it?

566
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,800
But it proves that I am competent to
lead my men, into the very jaws of death.

567
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,200
- After this, you may never expect
help from me again. - I am quite calm.

568
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,442
For if the blood-thirsty
boar spares me, the

569
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:46,624
foot-knights will see
Bubbling Bertie once again.

570
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,400
- Buford, you wouldn't do that to me?
Oh wouldn't I? - Well, ta-ta old girl.

571
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,200
If you please sir? What is it lassie?
Were you at the seige of Mafeking?

572
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,288
- Aye, that's where I
stopped the bullet that

573
00:52:35,313 --> 00:52:37,824
stopped me.
- Then did you know my father?

574
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,600
- Your father? What might his
name be lassie? - Captain I Crew.

575
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,400
- Was your father a Captain? - Yes. They
say he is dead, but I know it can't be.

576
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,641
- I've asked so many
soldiers about him. I hope

577
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,624
you can tell me.
- No lassie, I'm sorry, I can't.

578
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,453
- Why don't you ask in the hospital there?
- Maybe

579
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:58,224
they'll have some record of him.
Thank-you sir, I will!

580
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,800
- If you please sir.
- Well the little Princess as I live.

581
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,800
Why Mr. Bertie, I thought you'd
gone to war

582
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,753
No, Lord Roberts wanted
me to of course. But he

583
00:53:15,778 --> 00:53:18,224
said: "Bertie old boy,
the wounded need you."

584
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,000
So you stay here and cheer up the brave
lads who have fallen in our dust corps."

585
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,400
So I'm practically in command of
this hospital.

586
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,800
- Oh Mr. Bertie. Can my father be in there?
- Your father Princess?

587
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,400
Yes, you see I know he isn't dead.
I've been looking and looking.

588
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,400
He could be among the wounded, couldn't he?
Yes..... I'm almost sure he is, somewhere.

589
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,600
If you're in charge, could I please look
for him in there? Well ah..... Pleeeeeease.

590
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Yes, yes of course you may. Things
like that can happen you know.

591
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,495
Mr. Bertie,
why did you join the command here?

592
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,024
Well disipline in the
hospital is rather lax.

593
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:19,400
I say Major. They're waiting for you in
ward B. There is a lot of trash up there.

594
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,600
- Very good. I'll get one of my men to
attend to it. - Get one of your what??

595
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,400
Well then 2 of my men, carry on!

596
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,600
Portor! Sir?

597
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,046
- What's this child doing here before
visiting hours? - Well you see... Well,

598
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:42,024
well, well. If you please sir.
The Major is helping me find my father.

599
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,800
- The Major? - For her sir. You
see, we're old friends sir.

600
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,800
I knew her father, Captin Crew was
reported killed at Mafeking.

601
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,600
The child is sure there is some mistake, so
I'm helping her search among the wounded.

602
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,200
- Could you tell me anything about my
father sir? - Sorry my dear, I can't.

603
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,400
- Carry on, Major!
- Yes, sir. Thank-you sir.

604
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,500
This little girl's father
has been killed, but she

605
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:26,824
insists he's alive so I'm
letting her look around.

606
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,200
We'll try another ward.

607
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,400
- There's old Bertie.
- Give us a song mate.

608
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,200
Attention men! Attention! Official
inspection.

609
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,800
He isn't here either. But someone
might know about him.

610
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,974
If you please sir.
Were you at the seige of Mafeking?

611
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:16,824
I was that darling.
It's there I got bit by a bug.

612
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,048
It was no bigger than the seed
of a thistle and it laid me

613
00:56:20,073 --> 00:56:22,824
low. Ah, the bugs down there
are worse than the bullets.

614
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,100
- Perhaps you didn't know my father?
- Afraid I wouldn't

615
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:29,024
have known me own father,
with the fever that was on me.

616
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,400
- Thank-you sir.
- It's all right darling.

617
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,189
If you please sir.
Were you with the troops at Mafeking?

618
00:56:47,214 --> 00:56:50,424
Yes, yes of course I was.
That's where I ran away.

619
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,000
- Then did you know my father,
Captain Crew? - Yes, yes of course.

620
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,572
That's a fine looking officer, isn't he?
He ought to do well.

621
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:02,424
Well when did you see my father last?
Where is he now?

622
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,376
Where is who? My father.
Oh, one soldier more

623
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:07,624
or less, doesn't make
any difference you know.

624
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,463
I'm making thousands and
thousands for England. Fine

625
00:57:11,488 --> 00:57:14,624
strong fellows,
who won't be afraid like I was.

626
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,800
I was afraid of the noise. That's
why I ran away you know?

627
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,173
- He says he knows my father,
but he won't tell. - He's been

628
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:31,024
living in a dream Sara,
he doesn't know what he's saying.

629
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,600
Don't go yet lad. Give us a song!

630
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,272
- How about it dear?
Shall we sing them a song to cheer

631
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:41,824
them up?
- Our old speciality. Not today Mr. Bertie.

632
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,044
- Oh come on darling.
Let's try and forget our own troubles and

633
00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:47,824
do something for these lads, shall we?
- All right, I'll try.

634
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,619
- What about "The Old Kent Road"?
Yeah, that's the one.

635
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:52,624
Mackie will play for you.
- I'd be delighted Mac.

636
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,057
- Mr. Bertie, will it be all right
if I come again tomorrow? - I

637
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:11,024
shouldn't run away too often Princess.
You might get punished you know.

638
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,049
- I'll keep a sharp look-out
for whenever the wounded

639
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,624
come in. -You don't really
believe he come, do you?

640
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Yes, yes, of course I do. I told you
missing men often turn up.

641
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,200
Then I'd better come. You might
not know him, if he's very much changed.

642
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,800
- All right dear. You come.
- Good-bye Mr. Bertie. Good-bye dear.

643
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,400
Are you hungry.

644
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,200
Poor little things. There won't be
any worms for you this morning.

645
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,314
Good-morning little misses sahib.
Good morning

646
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,424
Ras Dass.
Feeding your little friends?

647
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,723
- Yes, but I couldn't feed
them very much from my supper

648
00:59:56,748 --> 00:59:59,824
last night. - It is difficult
for them when the snow comes.

649
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Rani, Rani!

650
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,800
You look as though you are being
naughty and enjoying it.

651
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
- Her she is, on the bookshelf.
- Bookshelf?

652
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,600
Oh I forgot. I pretend it's a bookshelf
and fill them with beautiful books.

653
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Well I'd better remove her, before
she ruins your set of Dickens.

654
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,666
This is your room Misses sahib?
It's so old and so high

655
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:38,024
above everything,
it's almost like a nest in a tree.

656
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,182
I can lie on my soft
sofa and look up into the

657
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:43,624
sky through that little
window on the roof.

658
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,400
- Sofa? - It looks more like a
soft sofa when it's made up.

659
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,600
Can you imagine it has down quilts
and lovely cushions to curl up on.

660
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,987
- There is a fire sometimes, of course?
- Well,

661
01:01:00,012 --> 01:01:03,224
that is the hardest
sometimes, to imagine.

662
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,913
But it's lovely when you can.
The grate shines so when

663
01:01:06,938 --> 01:01:09,824
it is polished and the
bright coals on the hearth.

664
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,190
Oh hurry Miss.
Cook is in an awful dither.

665
01:01:14,215 --> 01:01:16,624
Oh my goodness.
Excuse me if I run.

666
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,600
I've got to go to the butcher. I'll get
my ears boxed if I don't hurry.

667
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,600
Listen to this: Hospital Ship Mercy
arrived with 1 200 wounded disembarked.

668
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,600
- Does it give any of the names?
- There ain't no list.

669
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,237
Oh I hope my poor Harry's among them.
A wounded

670
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:52,424
husband is better than no
husband at all, eh Min?

671
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,843
Oh Becky,
I've got to get to the hospital

672
01:01:57,868 --> 01:02:00,824
before 9 o'clock when
they close for visitors.

673
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,800
Sara! You clumsy ox! For that
you'll whistle for your supper.

674
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,594
Oh Mame, Sara didn't get know lunch.
You put

675
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:15,224
things away before she
got back from the grocer.

676
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,679
Who do you think you're talking to?
You'll both go

677
01:02:18,704 --> 01:02:22,024
hungry. Now clean up this mess.
Go on, get on with it!

678
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,600
There some sorry cases in this
batch, doctor.

679
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,274
Doctor, this man is an unknown.
His papers were lost.

680
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:37,624
Delerium following maleria fever.

681
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,331
- We're very much concerned about him sir.
- Heart

682
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:42,824
action, weak resperation,
well that's to be expected.

683
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,671
- He has no lucid moments.
- Temporary paralyzes

684
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,024
of some nerve center or
a blood clot possibly.

685
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,600
More likely to be the latter sir.
He received a nasty headwound.

686
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,000
- He repeated the call of this person Sara.
- You can't know who this Sara is?

687
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,400
No way of finding out sir, until his
identity is established.

688
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,328
- You'd better go now Miss.
- I'll finish up

689
01:03:21,353 --> 01:03:23,824
for you. Thank-you Becky.
I'll have to fly.

690
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,960
Here hold your horses.
Where do you think you're going?

691
01:03:31,985 --> 01:03:35,224
Miss Lavina want's some coal
for her fire. Hop to it.

692
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Oh Sara! You look so tired and you
look hungry too.

693
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,400
- Are you actually hungry Sara? - Yes!
I am hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat you!

694
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,800
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.

695
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:18,000
Put on plenty, my father pays for it.

696
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,800
Come back here and clean up that hearth!

697
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,000
I'd like my shawl. The pink one. It's
on my bed.

698
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,400
Cover me please. I find the room a
bit chilly.

699
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,302
Hello Princess,
what are you doing out so late?

700
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,624
I've come to see the new
soldiers that arrived today.

701
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,600
- Not tonight my girl. It's closing time.
- But I've got to. I ran away especially.

702
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,200
- Please let me in. I'm sure he's here this
time. - You're sure every time Princess.

703
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,019
I'm sorry. You run on home and
come back tomorrow morning.

704
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:49,624
That's a good little girl.
All right, good-night now.

705
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,850
He'll recover from the
effects of the fever,

706
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:19,024
but I'm convinced there
is brain pressure.

707
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,100
You advise an operation then?
Yes. Do you agree.

708
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,824
I do and Dr. McNesh
in Edinburgh is the man.

709
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,800
Prepare this man for removal to
Edinburgh tomorrow. Yes doctor.

710
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:54,200
Sara, where have you been?

711
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,800
- Answer me. You've been out, haven't you?
- Yes Miss Minchin.

712
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,400
- What do you mean by disobeying my orders?
- I had to, I had to look for my father.

713
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,747
All this ridiculous searching
for your father. All this

714
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,824
making believe and refusing to face
facts, it's indecent.

715
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,206
- I've had enough of it.
You must realize once and for all that

716
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:16,424
your father is dead. - Don't you
say that. He's not dead. He's not!

717
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,539
- And you can't stop me from
looking for him either. - How

718
01:07:19,564 --> 01:07:22,024
dare you speak to me in
that manner you little......

719
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,200
I'll attend to you further in the morning.

720
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:41,600
I can't be a good soldier for much
longer. I'm cold and I'm hungry too.

721
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,701
Do you hear?
No, you don't hear and you don't

722
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:49,024
care. You're nothing but a
doll, a doll!

723
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,200
You've never had a heart to make
you feel. You're just a doll.

724
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,000
Your Highness, please forgive me,
but something has gone amiss.

725
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,000
There is an angry woman outside to
report a stolen kiss.

726
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,000
Tell her she must go away. Come
around some other day.

727
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,662
I have told her but she won't.
You must see her,

728
01:10:06,687 --> 01:10:08,624
if you don't,
she'll scream her head off.

729
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,016
- Tell her to hush. She won't be hushed.
- Then

730
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,224
tell her to shush!
I'm afraid she won't be shushed.

731
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,400
I won't be hushed, I won't be shushed, I
know my rights and I know also what I saw.

732
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
- What did you see?
- I saw him.

733
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,400
You saw who? I mean whom?

734
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,000
I saw that lad steal a kiss, from that
shameless little miss.

735
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,800
Don't be fooled by all their shyness,
they're a wicked pair Your Highness.

736
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,800
The Law says in its shining,
that you should not kiss in this land.

737
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,800
There's a law I understand, against
kissing in this land.

738
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,600
There is a law that reads like this.
No one is to steal a kiss.

739
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,600
Ah but Princess, I've a feeling, this
isn't a case of stealing.

740
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,400
Silence fool. I know the law. What
I say I saw, I saw.

741
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,200
She's on a see-saw. What I saw,
you saw, he saw, she saw.

742
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,800
On a see-saw. On a see-saw. l
saw, you saw, he saw, she saw.

743
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:09,200
What she tells us may be true. And
if it is, what can we do?

744
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,200
If you ask me, we should listen, to
the lad who did the kissing.

745
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,400
Let him speak. Come lad this way.
Now then, what have you to say?

746
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,400
Please Your Highness, I confess.
When I saw such lovliness...

747
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,400
it was too much to resist. I just
thought she should be kisssed.

748
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,600
So I kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.

749
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,400
So he kissed her, kissed her twice.
It was very, very nice.

750
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,600
There you see, he broke the law.
What I say I saw, I saw.

751
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,800
- Please don't start all that again.
- But he stole a kiss, that's plain.

752
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,600
Yes, it looks as if it's true and I'll
have to punish you.

753
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:03,400
No please. Let me say a word. It is
not the way you heard.

754
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,800
Please, he did not steal a kiss.
I gave it to him. Just like this.

755
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,400
There you see, I had a feeling, this
was not a case of stealing.

756
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'm not sure, it's not quite plain,
could I see that kiss again?

757
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,400
You were right, I have a feeling, this
was not a case of stealing.

758
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:38,000
Right! The law has been abused.
This lad has falsely been accused.

759
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,200
He's hers and she's hisn's, that old
witch should go to prison.

760
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,400
- You're a very wicked woman.
- Princess, I am only human.

761
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,600
Listen to the old grand-mommy.
You're a nasty peeping-tommy.

762
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.

763
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,400
Banish her from here forever.
Never show your face here, never.

764
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,600
But what I say I saw, I saw. I know
my rights, I know the law!

765
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,000
Come and sit beside me here. Your
kiss has made things very clear.

766
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,200
Thank-you Princess.

767
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,800
Don't thank me. Was that kiss, that
set you free.

768
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,200
Now we're through with this arrangement.
Let us have some entertainment.

769
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Bring the dancers, bring the singers,
bring the good old welting ringers.

770
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,935
- The new ballerina? She please you?
- She's

771
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,024
a very good dancer.
She looks familiar too.

772
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,400
What a nice dream. I feel quite warm.

773
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,000
I don't want to wake up.

774
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,200
I haven't waked up.

775
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,600
I must be dreaming.

776
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,800
I am dreaming.

777
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,800
I must be dreaming. But it feels
warm.

778
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,600
Becky, Becky come quick.

779
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,000
- Yes Miss?
- Look!

780
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,800
Oh no Miss. Do you see what I do?

781
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,600
- I don't know what you see. - But I don't
believe what I see. Well, I never.....

782
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,200
- Can you feel that? Yes Miss.
- What do you see? I see some fire Miss.

783
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,800
And a table with food on it, and a
rug and a lamp, and slippers?

784
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:48,800
I do indeed Miss. How did it all get
here? Did you pretend it into happening?

785
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,400
I don't know. I never pretended as
good as this before.

786
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,000
Look at these.

787
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,278
- If the little misses sahib
knew, she'd be

788
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:06,224
over here to thank you.
- Who wants any thanks?

789
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,600
- Oh Miss! You're beautiful! - Thanks
Becky. Now let's try this one on you.

790
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:22,400
- Isn't it beautiful? Oh yes Miss.
- It's perfect. And real satin too.

791
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,800
Let's try the slippers and see if
they're real.

792
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,800
- Do they feel like slippers to you?
- They feel soft and warm.

793
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:35,600
This feels soft and warm too.
They're as real as we are.

794
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,800
I don't believe it's a dream after all.

795
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
- Do you suppose the food is real Miss?
- Let us see.

796
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,600
- I can smell kippers, can you?
- Kippers and onions.

797
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,000
I wonder what this is? Muffins!

798
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,200
This tastes like a muffin. Is it one?

799
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,400
A muffin that ever was. It must be
the magic Miss.

800
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,800
Hadn't we better be quick before it
melts away?

801
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,200
- What sort of night did he have?
- He rested comfortably doctor.

802
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,362
Will we be able to
send him with the others?

803
01:18:17,387 --> 01:18:19,304
Will we be able to
send him with the others?

804
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,800
Get him ready to be sent with group
D. He'll be leaving in about an hour.

805
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,200
I hear you're being punished. Do you
think we ought to offer her a chocolate?

806
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,600
- You must let her smell them. - Miss
Minchin surely couldn't object to that.

807
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,600
- Would you care to? - I don't want to
smell them, and I don't want to eat them.

808
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,600
- You don't!? Why not? - I've had much
nicer things than chocolate this morning.

809
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,600
- Listen to the Princess, pretending again.
- I'm not pretending.

810
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I had the most wonderful things to
eat, that anyone had.

811
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:12,000
- Why you little liar. You haven't even had
breakfast. - Pardon me, but I really have.

812
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,200
Excuse me for saying so, it isn't
polite to call people liars.

813
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:22,600
- How dare you talk back to me.
- Was I doing that? My goodness.

814
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,800
So sorry.

815
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,000
You wait til I tell Miss Minchin on you!

816
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,400
Well, everything is still here Becky.

817
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,400
- Thank heavens it's stopped raining.
- Are you going some place Miss?

818
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,800
To the hospital. Becky, perhaps
everything is going to change for us.

819
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,800
Perhaps I'll find my father this time
and he'll take us away from here.

820
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,200
Oh no! It's the Misses.

821
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
Sara, how dare you......

822
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,400
- Why, what's happened to this room?
- That's what we would like to know.

823
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,393
When I woke up this morning,
here everything was.

824
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:10,024
Even to the food and the fire.

825
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,800
- Where did you get these things?
- I don't know. Maybe because

826
01:20:13,825 --> 01:20:17,224
I dreamed such a beautiful dream
last night, that it came true.

827
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:21,400
These articles are rare and costly.
You stole them, didn't you?

828
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,853
Oh no Miss Minchin.
We didn't take these things.

829
01:20:23,878 --> 01:20:26,224
I'll give you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

830
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,200
- But I am telling you the truth. - They
just came. Yes, they did indeed Mame.

831
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,000
You go to your room. This is a
matter for the police.

832
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,880
- Oh please Miss Minchin. Please don't call
the police. - Of course I'll call them.

833
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,735
- Oh we're prisoners sure enough
Miss, and the

834
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:54,024
police coming too.
- I can't be arrested.

835
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,341
- Those new wounded men
are at the hospital and I

836
01:20:57,366 --> 01:21:00,424
got to get to them.
- I don't see how you can Miss.

837
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,400
Come on Becky, quick. Where are
we going Miss? Follow me.

838
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,869
- Oh I'm so frightened Miss.
I'm frightened this

839
01:21:08,894 --> 01:21:11,024
time too.
- Come on Becky, give me your hand.

840
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,000
- Oh low Miss.
- Don't be afraid Becky.

841
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,345
- Ah, what game is this little
Misses sihib? - Can we please

842
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:34,024
go through your house?
We're running away from the police.

843
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,000
- And a very nice game to. Would you enter?
- We would like to, very much indeed.

844
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,141
- You seem in great haste Miss sihib.
Will you not stop for a

845
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:52,624
cup of tea? - Oh no thank you.
We're in too big of a hurry.

846
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,800
Oh, I see. You are still playing the
game of the police.

847
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,200
- I hope you escape in safety Miss sihib.
- So do I. Oh low Miss, police!!

848
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:05,400
- There they are! Stop them!
- Becky, run, run!

849
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,600
Sara, Becky! Stop where you are!

850
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Go after the other one. I'll take care
of her.

851
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,400
Watch out Becky, don't slip. Becky,
where are you?

852
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,639
Wretched little beast.
You'll go to jail, both of you!

853
01:22:41,664 --> 01:22:44,024
You'll never catch Sara.
Mr. Bertie will see to that.

854
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,264
So that's where she's gone.
Well did you find them Mame? Take this

855
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:50,024
little thief and don't let her
out of your sight till I return.

856
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,141
- Did you catch her?
She dodged her way into traffic. - I

857
01:22:53,165 --> 01:22:55,576
couldn't find her anywhere.
Do you know where she's likely to be?

858
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,600
I do. Cabbie!

859
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,800
Harvard Hospital and hurry please.

860
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,200
He never stops calling for her.

861
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,200
Step aside a little bit will you? Ah,
ah, ah. You can't go in there.

862
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,400
- No visitors allowed for an hour.
- But that might be too late.

863
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,200
Now run along little girl, will you?

864
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:51,200
- I'm sorry sir. No visitors allowed
for an hour. - But we must go in.

865
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,600
Sorry sir. You can stand over there,
if that's all right.

866
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,800
- Have you seen Captain Marks? - I believe
he just went through the hall Miss.

867
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,920
- Sorry young one, but you can't
go upstairs now. - But I've got to.

868
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,664
I've got to see if my father is
here before Miss Minchin catches me.

869
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,600
Run along now. Do as you are told.

870
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,800
I say there. You come back here.
You can't go up there.

871
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,000
You can't go in there.

872
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,000
Let me go, let me go. I want to be
here. I will! I will!

873
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,000
Porter!!

874
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,600
What is it the child wants?

875
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:43,800
- Please, please don't let them
take me away. - What is it child?

876
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:48,400
My father. They say he was killed
at Mafeking, but I don't believe it.

877
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,400
He may be with the new wounded
men, but they won't let me look.

878
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,470
If they don't,
perhaps I'll never have another

879
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:57,824
chance.
Can't you make them let me look.

880
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:04,400
Colonel. Could you see that this
child is escorted through the hospital?

881
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,600
With permission, I shall accompany
her personally Your Majesty.

882
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:17,800
- What is your name?
- Victoria. What is yours?

883
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,400
Sara.......Oh Your Majesty!

884
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,000
Colonel.

885
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:39,000
I hope that you will fi nd your father
my dear. A thorough search Colonel.

886
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:44,800
- Oh thank-you Your Majesty.
- Good-bye my dear.

887
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,000
- Have you been through any of
the wards yet? - Not today sir.

888
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,200
I think we'd better cover this wing first.

889
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,800
We are searching for a patient.
Move right along dear.

890
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,600
- Is it all right?
- Thank-you darling.

891
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,400
- Miss Rose!
- Sara darling!

892
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:42,400
Oh Mr. Geoffrey. You're home, you're back
again. You can tell me where my daddy is.

893
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,800
Well Geoffrey didn't get as far as
Mafeking dear.

894
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,800
Then you don't know? You didn't
even see him?

895
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,200
No dear, I didn't. I'm sorry.

896
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,200
- Have you found him?
- Oh, no sir.

897
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:07,000
This is my friend Mr. Geoffrey and
his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.

898
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,661
- Mrs. Hamilton.
- I'm afraid I can't introduce you,

899
01:27:09,686 --> 01:27:11,784
because I don't know your name.
- I'm Colonel Gordon.

900
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,286
- This is Colonel Gordan.
He's helping me search the

901
01:27:14,311 --> 01:27:16,424
hospital.
- Oh, don't bother. How do you do sir?

902
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,000
I'm very happy to know you both.
From Mafeking?

903
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:26,600
- No sir. An army mule, a British mule at
that. - That's adding insult to injury.

904
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,400
- Sorry sir, but it's time for the patient's
drops. - Well, I'd rather face that mule.

905
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,800
I'll come back later Miss Rose. Just as
soon as I've gone through the other wards.

906
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,600
- I'll wait for you dear.
- Good-bye.

907
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,200
- Be sure to come back Sara.
- I will.

908
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,800
Poor little thing. She'll never stop
hoping.

909
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,528
- I insist that you send for my brother.
- Very well

910
01:27:54,553 --> 01:27:57,424
Mame, but you can't get in.
Brother or no brother.

911
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,600
- We will get in. My brother will see
to that. - I hope you're right Mame.

912
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,800
All filled now. This man will have to
wait until the next ambulance.

913
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,235
I think you'd better take
him into the waiting room.

914
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,024
These halls are much too drafty.

915
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,000
- I very sorry that you couldn't find your
father. - Thank-you just the same sir.

916
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,146
He may be on the next
convoy of wounded.

917
01:28:36,171 --> 01:28:38,224
I wouldn't give up hope.
I won't sir.

918
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,400
- Good-bye and God bless.
- Good-bye.

919
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,600
I know that they were stolen.
That is perposterous!

920
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:49,624
I can prove it and I intend to
turn her over to the authorities.

921
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,841
She is in this hospital
and I intend to find her.

922
01:28:52,866 --> 01:28:55,024
I insist that every
room be searched.

923
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
Sara...

924
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,600
Sara...

925
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,600
Daddy...

926
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Daddy, daddy! It is you! I found
you, I found you!

927
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,282
They said you were dead,
but I knew you weren't.

928
01:29:35,307 --> 01:29:36,424
I knew you'd come back.

929
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:43,000
Oh daddy, hold me, hold me close.
You won't ever go away again, will you?

930
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,200
What's the matter daddy? Why
won't you talk to me?

931
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,600
Don't you know me daddy? I'm
Sara, I'm Sara.

932
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,600
- Where is my daughter?
- Oh daddy, something's happened to you.

933
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,400
Mr. Bertie! Mr. Bertie! Oh daddy,
you've got to know me.

934
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,400
Look at me!

935
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:16,000
You mustn't cry. You mustn't cry.

936
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,800
- We must be good soldiers you know.
- But I have

937
01:30:19,825 --> 01:30:22,824
been a good soldier daddy,
but you don't know me.

938
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:29,200
- My little Sara never cries.
- But I'm Sara, I'm Sara!

939
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,400
Yes, yes,...Sara! Sara!

940
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,400
Sara, my darling. My baby Sara.

941
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,200
Sara my darling. My little Sara.

942
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,870
- Oh don't be ridiculous Amanada.
- Well then how do you account for

943
01:30:56,894 --> 01:30:59,576
those silk covers, those robes and
those other things that are there.

944
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,480
Perhaps a little bird brought them in.
Perhaps they grew legs and walked

945
01:31:02,505 --> 01:31:05,424
in. I don't know. One thing I do know
is little Sara wouldn't steal them.

946
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,178
Bertie! Yes?
Berties, what do you think has happened?

947
01:31:08,203 --> 01:31:10,624
Little Princess has found her father.
She's found him!

948
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,237
- Captain Crew is alive?
- Of course he's alive!

949
01:31:13,262 --> 01:31:15,224
How could she find him
if he wasn't alive?

950
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:23,200
- Oh Mr. Bertie, I found my father.
- Darling, I'm so glad.

951
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,800
Daddy, it's Your Majesty.

952
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,600
My daddy.
