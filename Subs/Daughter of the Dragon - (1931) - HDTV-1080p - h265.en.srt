1
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:39,994
Come on, hurry.

2
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,121
Princess Ling Moy.

3
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:52,211
You are incomparable. Superb.

4
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,301
Please come back to us soon.

5
00:02:55,023 --> 00:02:56,529
Thank you, Mr Webster.

6
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,129
Goodbye.

7
00:02:58,891 --> 00:02:59,813
Goodbye.

8
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,021
How lovely.

9
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,826
Isn't that beautiful?

10
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,716
Your manager.

11
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:20,535
Come in, Morloff.

12
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,063
As always.

13
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,290
My friends and guests of the evening.

14
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:30,635
Miss Joan Marshall.

15
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,485
And her fiancÃ©e, Mr Ronald Petrie.

16
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,641
Ling Moy is honoured.

17
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:38,488
Your dancing bewitched us.

18
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,186
May I too, congratulate you?

19
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:42,826
Ling Moy shall endeavour
to deserve this praise.

20
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,477
I see you are staying at Mr Morloff's
house until you leave for South America?

21
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:47,664
Ah, Princess.

22
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,416
The Petries are neighbours of ours.

23
00:03:50,824 --> 00:03:52,443
Oh, the charming white house?
- Yes.

24
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:53,857
The one next door.

25
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,867
Now that you are free I
hope we may see you often.

26
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,966
I too .. dare hope for it.

27
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,649
Goodnight, Princess.

28
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:04,188
Goodnight.

29
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:07,274
I shall join you in a moment.
- Right you are, Morloff.

30
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,020
Is there any news of my father?

31
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,622
He has arrived in London.
- Is he at your house?

32
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,795
He will be there tonight.

33
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:21,716
And shall I see him?

34
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,339
Undoubtedly.

35
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:52,947
Now, now. Understand, Ah Kee.

36
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:57,144
As a special worker for
Scotland Yard, you are first rate.

37
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:00,477
In fact I am sorry you
can't join us officially.

38
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,899
But this time, you are
barking up the wrong tree.

39
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:08,956
These records prove that Fu Manchu
died twenty years ago.

40
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,068
His body was not found.

41
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,455
He never appeared again.

42
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:17,292
He is here, in London.

43
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:19,306
I saw him tonight.

44
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:23,782
A resemblance?
- Perhaps.

45
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,910
But if I happen to be right.

46
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:29,071
Petrie should be warned.

47
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,687
Yes.

48
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,167
If you are right.

49
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,443
Get me Sir John Petrie's house.

50
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:41,982
What?

51
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:44,188
Are you sure?

52
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,401
The telephone wire has been cut.

53
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,834
Hobbs.
- Yes sir?

54
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,506
Get me two cars and half a dozen men.

55
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:55,476
We leave immediately
for the Petrie house.

56
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:56,411
Right, sir.

57
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:03,350
I wish I could find a
word to describe her.

58
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:07,777
Exotic. That's the word.

59
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:09,282
And ..

60
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,135
She's intriguing, if you
know what I mean, father.

61
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,246
He knows very well
what you mean, Ronald.

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,525
At your age, he was very much like you.

63
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,390
Even more so, I should say.

64
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,466
Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm intruding.

65
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:25,869
You want something, Rogers?

66
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,108
No, sir. Well that is,
you see, I blundered.

67
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,673
You what?
- Sir, it's my glasses.

68
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,679
I don't see well without them.

69
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:37,510
And I left them in the study when I
came in here a few moments ago.

70
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,314
To get a copy of Black Beauty.

71
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,328
But instead, I got ..

72
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,137
I've got ..

73
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:45,861
I've got it.

74
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:51,168
Oh, I've typed those notes, Sir John.
- Very good, Rogers.

75
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:54,336
I'll look over them at once.
- Yes, sir. Well, goodnight.

76
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,359
Mr Morloff.
- Goodnight, Rogers.

77
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,640
Goodnight, Rogers.

78
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,488
That is for Sir John.
- Very well, Flinders.

79
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,534
Oh. Excuse me.

80
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:33,265
Sir John, may I see you
a moment, privately?

81
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,635
Certainly, Rogers. Come up to my study.

82
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,345
Oh, there they are.

83
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh yes.

84
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:54,618
There.

85
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,483
Oh very good. Very good, Rogers.

86
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,846
In fact, I'd say .. splendid.

87
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,453
Now, what about your private business?
- Oh.

88
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,280
Well I have a problem, sir.
- Oh?

89
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,680
By all means, marry the girl.

90
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,966
Sir, it is not that sort of a problem.

91
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,742
Oh, not that sort? Well, what sort?

92
00:08:27,984 --> 00:08:29,950
Well you see, in opening your letters.

93
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,295
I've tried to keep from you,
advertisements and that sort of thing.

94
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,679
Quite right.
- And ..

95
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,899
Well then, I'm justified
and thank you very much.

96
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,439
That was easily settled.

97
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,880
Well, I wouldn't have
bothered you, but you see.

98
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,408
This was exceptional.

99
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:44,641
Advertisements?

100
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:46,833
They must be. They're not letters.
- Let me see them.

101
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,978
No, no. I've annoyed you quite enough
and they're really all far too serious.

102
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,977
Rogers.

103
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:06,771
These are warnings of death.

104
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,173
It's appalling. Why in heaven's name
didn't you mention this before?

105
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:12,318
Call Sir Basil Courtney at once.

106
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:15,931
Hello, hello.

107
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:18,843
The phone is dead.

108
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:24,576
The wire is cut.

109
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:26,126
Rogers.

110
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,214
Telephone from Morloff's place.

111
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,088
Ask Sir Basil to come here immediately.

112
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,233
But say nothing of this to
Lady Petrie or the others.

113
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,995
Now hurry, hurry. As fast as you can.

114
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:45,132
Fu Manchu coming here?

115
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,173
From the grave?

116
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,120
I am here, Doctor.

117
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,810
Born, ready and risen.

118
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,379
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

119
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:03,026
You!

120
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:06,626
The murderer of my father
and his father before him.

121
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:09,807
What more can you want?

122
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:13,015
To wipe the slate clean.

123
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:17,619
May I sit down?

124
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,914
My advanced years, you see.

125
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,805
In the twenty years
I have fought to live.

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,549
The thought of killing you and your
son has been my dearest nurse.

127
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:54,038
I have used my time.

128
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:56,812
To perfect the most ..

129
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,095
Ingenious .. death.

130
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,785
For you both.
- You'll never do it.

131
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:04,672
You murdering madman.

132
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:10,340
My first precaution .. naturally.

133
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,298
You devil.

134
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:14,662
If you dare to lay a finger on my boy.

135
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,947
If you dare to hurt .. to hurt ..

136
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,471
I will ..

137
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:24,533
Do you feel the atrophy
of the throat muscle?

138
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,618
A unique poison has been
mixed in your tobacco.

139
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:32,592
A most mischievous formula.

140
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:34,493
As witnessed.

141
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:41,000
You see?

142
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,458
Your mind is completely ..

143
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,927
Under my control.

144
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:53,934
Walk .. Sir John.

145
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:07,457
Is Sir John at home?
- Yes, Sir Basil.

146
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,635
Hobbs .. you and Bentley stop here.
- Yes, sir.

147
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,502
Hello, Sir Basil.
- Where is your father, Ronald?

148
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,475
In the study.
- Thank you. I'd like to see him.

149
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:22,118
Why Sir Basil, what's wrong?
- No cause for alarm, Lady Petrie.

150
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:25,547
I just want a word or two with Sir John.
- I'll fetch him down now.

151
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:29,826
Why, father.

152
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,607
Stop .. Sir John.

153
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,174
Fu Manchu!

154
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:41,452
If you love Sir John, do not shoot.

155
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,472
The shock of a pistol report.

156
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,929
Would kill him instantly.

157
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:48,075
Oh, don't.

158
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:51,229
Ah, Lady Petrie.

159
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,381
The accumulated greetings of 20 years.

160
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,979
My beloved ones were
killed before my eyes.

161
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,959
In like manner I shall
now cancel the debt.

162
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,972
Walk, Sir John.

163
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:13,684
My first victim now
descends towards you.

164
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:17,289
His life hanging by a strained thread.

165
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,720
Which my vengeance now .. severs!

166
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:23,614
John!

167
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,455
You, Ronald Petrie.

168
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,225
Are the remainder of the forfeit.

169
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,692
And your life too .. is mine.

170
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,030
Oh Ronald, you'll be killed!

171
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,930
After him!

172
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,181
Sir Basil, he's dead.

173
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,899
Bentley, Flinders.

174
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,334
Help me carry him in there.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,948
This passage leads to the way out.

176
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:37,770
Did he double back this way, sir?

177
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:39,338
No.

178
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:42,635
Hobbs .. I'm going to put an
extra guard around the house.

179
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:44,815
You warn the local Police.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:46,823
Mr Morloff.

181
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,559
I heard a shot as I came through
the garden. What's happened?

182
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,732
Sir John has been killed.

183
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:05,467
Master.

184
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:08,652
Is my daughter here?
- Yes, master.

185
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,564
Then make haste.

186
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:14,452
Prepare the .. altar room.

187
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,147
Bring Ling Moy to me there.

188
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,588
The Great Lord awaits his daughter.

189
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:42,743
Your noble father will receive you.

190
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,148
My flower daughter.

191
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,387
My honoured father.

192
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,760
May your days be laughing songs.

193
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:29,105
And may the blood of your father.

194
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,665
Course warmly in your veins.

195
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,855
For within the hour,
he will be gathered.

196
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:39,203
To his revered ancestors.
- No, no.

197
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,578
I've only just found you.

198
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:43,267
Noble father.

199
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:58,969
The emblem of the great house of Fu.

200
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:02,919
As a child, you cried yourself to sleep.

201
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:05,636
Over its tragic fairy story.

202
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,550
So at last, my daughter.

203
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,559
The story .. is true.

204
00:17:14,104 --> 00:17:15,279
Mother and brother.

205
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,109
Murdered by a Petrie.

206
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:18,613
Yours ..

207
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:22,323
Yours is the noble house of Fu.

208
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,293
Then you?

209
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,242
I, your father ..

210
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,441
Am Fun Manchu.

211
00:17:34,877 --> 00:17:37,033
Live, live. Divine father.

212
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:40,097
Infamous father.

213
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,105
I sent you away.

214
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,569
Into the occidental world.

215
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:49,651
To keep you from me until
I should deserve your homage.

216
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:51,806
Instead.

217
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:54,721
You now witness my shame.

218
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:02,339
Great spirits beyond.

219
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,937
I come to you.

220
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,330
Crawling in the dust.

221
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:19,040
Death lays its hands upon me.

222
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,453
And my sacred work is unfinished.

223
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,632
That Petrie still lives.

224
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:27,796
The dishonour ..

225
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,601
Is burned upon my forehead.

226
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:37,116
Master.

227
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:40,420
Let this unworthy slave
finish the sacred work.

228
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:44,703
Only one of the House of Fu
can redeem our honour.

229
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:50,332
The blood is mine.

230
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,370
The hate is mine.

231
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,395
The vengeance shall be mine.

232
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,953
My flower daughter.

233
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:04,225
The knife would wither
your petal fingers.

234
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:08,487
I call to my ancestors.

235
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:13,201
If only thou had granted me another son.

236
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,223
Father.

237
00:19:16,984 --> 00:19:17,952
Father!

238
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:20,908
I will be your son.

239
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:26,562
I will be your son!

240
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,535
Swear .. man-daughter.

241
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:39,435
To deliver the soul of
Ronald Petrie to me.

242
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:42,129
To our ancestors.

243
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,656
I swear.

244
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:51,312
Sovereign spirit.

245
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:54,804
You have answered my deepest prayer.

246
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:57,851
I have a son!

247
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,592
Chair.

248
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:22,632
Do not leave me, father.
Death must not take you.

249
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:25,076
Yes.

250
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,286
And my death.

251
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,224
Will make you innocent in their eyes.

252
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,773
For I shall be discovered.

253
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,622
In an attempt to kill you.
- Father!

254
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,653
It will bring the boy
near you in sympathy.

255
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,426
And through the tunnel.

256
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,989
My good servant Morloff,
is inducted in their house.

257
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,833
You will have a hidden
approach to the hated Petrie.

258
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:50,687
When you are ready to strike.

259
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:55,874
Lu Chung.
- Yes, master?

260
00:20:56,864 --> 00:21:00,103
Tell the Amah .. to call for help.

261
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:01,861
Say.

262
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,535
The Princess is being murdered.

263
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:15,989
When they enter .. and shoot me down.

264
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,977
You will thank them.

265
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:19,971
No!

266
00:21:21,456 --> 00:21:24,135
You will .. thank .. them.

267
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,760
And now.

268
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,032
Goodbye.

269
00:21:50,756 --> 00:21:53,414
My son, at such a time ..

270
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:57,428
Should know how to say
a courageous farewell.

271
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:05,362
Goodbye.

272
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,528
My honoured father.

273
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:25,004
Hobbs.
- Yes, sir?

274
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,536
Coming, sir.

275
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:29,836
Not a trace of him out here.
- Well, what have you done?

276
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:32,329
I've thrown a cordon round the
house aided by the Police.

277
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:34,898
Send for some more to increase
the guard. Put some of them back ..

278
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:37,650
What's that?

279
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:50,976
Come inside quick!

280
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:52,976
Come inside. They're killing her!

281
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,521
This way. Come quick!

282
00:22:54,777 --> 00:22:55,980
Stay down here, Bentley.

283
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,797
You murderer.
- You see, he's through.

284
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,612
Ling Moy. My Princess, are you safe?

285
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:23,672
This is her bedroom.
What is this man doing here?

286
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:24,838
Wait.

287
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:26,891
He's dead.

288
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,725
Are you alright?

289
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,307
Fu Manchu killed my father.

290
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,766
And Ling Moy graciously.

291
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:51,174
Thanks you.

292
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,468
For his death.

293
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,115
I understand.

294
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,888
I'm sorry.

295
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,097
You are very kind.

296
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:14,478
Ronald.

297
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:16,421
Thanks to Ah Kee.

298
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:19,304
This is the last page.

299
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:22,765
Of a terrible record.

300
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:38,205
Father.

301
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:41,219
I will ..

302
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,540
I will.

303
00:24:58,228 --> 00:25:02,309
Why not tear up the South American
contract and remain just here with me?

304
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:04,699
Could I tear my beauty, too?

305
00:25:09,995 --> 00:25:10,791
Ling Moy.

306
00:25:11,174 --> 00:25:13,931
These last two months have
been very, very beautiful.

307
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:17,645
And I've had terrible
regrets over your going.

308
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:19,353
Will you?

309
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,392
Yes .. many.

310
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:23,727
Then chuck everything and stay.

311
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:26,246
If I stay.

312
00:25:26,806 --> 00:25:28,757
Would my hair ever become golden curls?

313
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,927
And my skin ivory like Ronald's?

314
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,755
It's strange. I prefer yours.

315
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,496
I shall never forget your
hair and your eyes.

316
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,430
It's only a passing fascination.

317
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,893
It was fascination.

318
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:47,029
The leopard and the deer
stroll too amicably together.

319
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:50,896
By talking much, she learns much.

320
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:53,608
The Chinese heart is
very constant Ronald.

321
00:25:54,373 --> 00:25:55,992
It might be sadly wounded.

322
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,061
In one of your western affairs.

323
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:01,107
But don't you realize ..
- Ronald .. Ronald.

324
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:03,337
Oh, Ronald.

325
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,379
Alright, Joan.

326
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,234
You will let me drive you into town?
- Yes.

327
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:10,278
In half an hour, then?

328
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,387
Here we are, Joan.

329
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,143
Tea is ready.

330
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:30,291
Of course it is the
un-spiced, English variety.

331
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:33,924
Oh, I don't think I'll have any,
thanks. You see, wait, dear.

332
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:37,760
I promised to drive Ling Moy into town.
- But you didn't bother to explain.

333
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,702
Oh but Joan, I just happened
to say I'd drive her.

334
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:43,230
It's a happy coincidence,
isn't it that you ..

335
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:45,771
Promise to do the very
thing you preferred.

336
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,951
Yes, but Joan.

337
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,445
Lu Chung humbly offers
that the time is short.

338
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,397
I am aware.

339
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:24,313
Perhaps Ling Moy divides
her strength between duty ..

340
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:26,142
And the advice of the heart.

341
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:30,068
I am giving him a beautiful illusion.

342
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,391
Which I shall crush.
- I pray that it is so.

343
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,321
For one foot cannot stand on two boats.

344
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:41,382
Lu Chung. You are insolent.

345
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:43,852
I just echo the thought of your people.

346
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,210
Who demand some word from you.

347
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,222
They are even more insolent.

348
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,395
What shall I tell them?

349
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,087
Tell them the orders shall
be executed tonight.

350
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:56,600
Death will first awaken
Petrie from sleep.

351
00:27:57,996 --> 00:28:00,750
And then end this lingering
horror with a slow knife.

352
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,178
Tell them that.

353
00:28:08,182 --> 00:28:11,160
That would be Mr Ah Kee at your door.

354
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,142
Did he follow you from Limehouse?
- No doubt.

355
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:17,041
But may he not call here at any time?

356
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,412
He has been dedicated to guard you.

357
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,969
And loves his work.

358
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:22,688
What does he know of you?

359
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:25,595
My unsavoury reputation only.

360
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:28,412
Mr Ah Kee.

361
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,385
Lu Chung, he must not find you here.

362
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:35,648
Lottery tickets.

363
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:38,604
Send him in.

364
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,054
Come in.

365
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:56,689
Princess.

366
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:02,266
Ling Moy is abased to be
found at a sacred vice.

367
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:04,675
Lottery tickets.

368
00:29:05,981 --> 00:29:08,288
These I keep, Lu Chung. You may go.

369
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:15,135
You prosper, Lu Chung?

370
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:17,316
It is a vile calling.

371
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:19,296
I preach against it.

372
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:28,361
Won't you sit down?

373
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:29,919
Thank you.

374
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:34,985
How did you come to know him?

375
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:37,080
He came to know me.

376
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:38,716
With his tickets.

377
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:43,296
I do not trust him.
- Is there danger?

378
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,185
Hardly.

379
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,924
I am just over-eager for your safety.

380
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:53,133
Perhaps the personal
interest makes me so.

381
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,710
I should not have guessed it
from your quiet manner.

382
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:00,004
Ling Moy.

383
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,519
I have watched you every
night at the theatre, silently.

384
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:09,290
And dreamed of our closer friendship.

385
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,092
Let us remember.

386
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:16,175
There are few days
left .. for friendship.

387
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,292
With all my humble heart.

388
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:43,600
Upstairs.

389
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:46,282
Third door on the left.

390
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:19,434
Who are you, please? Who are you?

391
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:20,532
Petrie.

392
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:22,274
Petrie.

393
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,039
Why, Mr Ah Kee.

394
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,239
Whatever in the world
has happened to you?

395
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:33,343
Did you see anyone?

396
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:34,933
No, no.

397
00:34:35,248 --> 00:34:37,843
Is Petrie dead?
- Petrie? Why I ..

398
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:39,928
Ronald .. Ronald!

399
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:41,373
Are you alright, now?

400
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,407
Turn on the light.
- The light?

401
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,700
Oh dear, dear. I hope I can find them.

402
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:57,103
Won't you please tell
me what's happened?

403
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:58,719
I don't know exactly.

404
00:34:59,424 --> 00:35:00,169
Ah Kee.

405
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:01,558
What's up?

406
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,434
What's the matter?

407
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,505
There was an attempt
on your life tonight.

408
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:07,627
What do you mean?

409
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:09,718
Get Scotland Yard at once.
- Yes.

410
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:13,847
Ah Kee, you are hurt.
- Never mind about me.

411
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:15,818
As long as you are safe.

412
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:18,974
Hello .. hello, give me Scotland Yard.

413
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,866
No, no, no. Scotland Yard!

414
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,536
What .. what's that?

415
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,010
Well, I have every reason for shouting.

416
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:28,975
The circumstances are distinctly
of a shout-able nature.

417
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:30,638
What? What's that?

418
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:35,725
Well, my dear young woman, let
me tell you a brisk something.

419
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,151
If you are going to ..

420
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,533
Will you please give me Scotland Yard?

421
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,577
Thank you.
- Wouldn't you have thought ..

422
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,337
Was I really shouting?

423
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:52,244
Sir Basil, please.

424
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:55,441
Sir Basil?

425
00:35:55,817 --> 00:35:56,657
Ah Kee.

426
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,126
Ronald, what is it?
- Sorry, mother.

427
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:01,730
Yes, just as I thought.

428
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:04,724
Send a few men immediately.

429
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:08,085
Yes. Alright for the moment.

430
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,565
Mr Ah Kee, what's happened?

431
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,974
There were intruders
tonight, Lady Petrie.

432
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,317
Fu Manchu .. I feared it.

433
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:17,973
I told Sir Basil.

434
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:19,416
Ling Moy.

435
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,259
Ronald, where are you going?

436
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,444
Fu Manchu attempted to kill her, too.

437
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:26,949
Ah Kee, her life may
be in danger tonight.

438
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,017
Right, Petrie, I'll go with you.

439
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,349
Ronald, don't go out.

440
00:36:33,837 --> 00:36:34,592
Ronald.

441
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,307
Where are you going?
- Well, I ought ..

442
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:39,822
I will go with them.

443
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:41,947
I don't think they'll need you.

444
00:36:42,508 --> 00:36:46,403
Lady Petrie, I feel to a great extent
I am responsible for this tragedy.

445
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,582
I would gladly lay down my life.

446
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:52,326
Thank you, but I think you'd
better stay with me now.

447
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,990
That's right. Those intruders
might still be lurking about.

448
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,758
You don't really think so, do you?

449
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,205
Princess.

450
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:08,643
It is accomplished?

451
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:29,049
Morloff, we've got to
see you for a minute.

452
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:32,287
Come in, gentlemen.

453
00:37:36,598 --> 00:37:38,419
Someone entered our house tonight.
- Yes.

454
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,416
Agents of Fu Manchu.

455
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,017
Fu Manchu?

456
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:43,779
I can't believe it.

457
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,226
You must be mistaken.
- Is Ling Moy safe?

458
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:48,823
Of course.

459
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,061
There was no disturbance here.

460
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,356
Are you sure?

461
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,226
Amah.

462
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,085
Amah.

463
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:00,987
You know of course,
why they fear for her?

464
00:38:01,595 --> 00:38:02,659
Certainly.

465
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:04,401
Amah.

466
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:07,295
You have just been with the Princess?

467
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,928
Yes .. she is sleeping.

468
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:13,484
I was sure of it.

469
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,705
That's all.

470
00:38:17,593 --> 00:38:19,524
I think it would be unwise to wake her.

471
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:21,238
Oh quite right. It would alarm her.

472
00:38:21,681 --> 00:38:23,616
I am posting a guard
around the Petrie house.

473
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:26,047
If you wish, Mr Morloff.

474
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,936
Would you, please. Just a few men
on the grounds outside my place.

475
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,997
I'll keep extra watch indoors.

476
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,712
Righto .. goodnight.

477
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:35,315
Goodnight. Thank you, both.

478
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:37,099
Goodnight, Morloff.

479
00:38:37,642 --> 00:38:38,571
Goodnight.

480
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:43,081
Princess .. at least tell me.

481
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:45,595
Was his dying as
gratifying as I told you?

482
00:38:45,695 --> 00:38:46,600
Lu Chung.

483
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,138
Morloff .. you are not
permitted in my room.

484
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,810
I take the liberty.

485
00:38:56,406 --> 00:38:58,458
I have just spoken to Petrie.
- But ..

486
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:02,940
It was not done?

487
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:04,902
No.

488
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,486
You, a weakling?

489
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:08,536
Why didn't you strike?

490
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,985
I delayed, then heard a noise.

491
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:13,517
You love him?

492
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:14,842
Remember.

493
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:18,223
Your father said that if you faltered ..

494
00:39:18,466 --> 00:39:19,770
A weakness overcame me.

495
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:20,941
Pah.

496
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:23,921
It is wisely written.

497
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,843
A stupid son is better
than a crafty daughter.

498
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:31,561
It is written. It is written.

499
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,848
It should be written that a slave do
reverence to a daughter of the light.

500
00:39:45,478 --> 00:39:46,710
Night prayers.

501
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,520
I will burn this incense of repentance.

502
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:01,813
At her prayers.

503
00:40:02,323 --> 00:40:03,863
The master provided it.

504
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:07,204
For the weak half of her,
which is woman.

505
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,626
Go.

506
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,989
I can't kill him .. I love him.

507
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:25,266
I would rather kill myself.

508
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,929
A half-fit maiden.

509
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:40,723
Would pour her blood.

510
00:40:41,427 --> 00:40:42,666
On love's author.

511
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:45,122
Yes. It would be her release.

512
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:48,351
Her petty torment would then be ended.

513
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:52,451
And for the peace of
this one miserable soul.

514
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:57,317
The souls of our ancestors will
forever burn in the fire of dishonour.

515
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,873
Pah!

516
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:06,398
There is your place.

517
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,992
Make peace .. with your father.

518
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:34,877
My father.

519
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,023
Give me understanding.

520
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:41,079
"We are not resting."

521
00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:43,681
"We shall never rest."

522
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:47,370
"Until you kill him .. who remains."

523
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:51,036
"Ling Moy."

524
00:41:52,603 --> 00:41:53,904
"You must."

525
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,061
"Kill."

526
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,818
Forgive me, majestic father.

527
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:01,490
I will.

528
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:03,524
I will.

529
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:21,568
Your commendable fears may rest.

530
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,169
It shall be accomplished.

531
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:27,881
Your weakness last evening has
made the task quite difficult.

532
00:42:28,351 --> 00:42:30,575
It is necessary only
to lure Petrie here.

533
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:33,521
Pardon? Mr Ah Kee is the obstacle.

534
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:36,945
It was he whom I overpowered
in the hallway last night.

535
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:41,504
And from this moment on, Mr Ah Kee
and Petrie will be inseparable.

536
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,401
And if I should lure Mr Ah Kee away?

537
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:48,129
Hmm, that is a desired convenience.

538
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:50,916
I have taken the oath of a son.

539
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:54,320
But I shall again become
the daughter of Fu Manchu.

540
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,237
And a woman.

541
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,448
When the branch creaks, the leaf shakes.

542
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,195
Lu Chung is glad to hear.

543
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:08,136
At nightfall then.

544
00:43:08,605 --> 00:43:11,095
With the aid of Mr Morloff .. we shall.

545
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:17,866
Checkmate.

546
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,447
Well, really.
- See for yourself, old man.

547
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,743
Couldn't we go out in the air for a bit?

548
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:29,052
It wouldn't be safe at night.

549
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:31,715
Bored?

550
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:34,029
Bored? Oh, not with you, Ah Kee.

551
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:40,587
Mr Ah Kee. Mr Morloff on
the telephone for you, sir.

552
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,209
Morloff?
- Yes, sir.

553
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:47,214
Will you excuse me a minute?
- Surely.

554
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:55,071
Hello?

555
00:43:55,296 --> 00:43:57,999
Oh .. just a moment, Mr Ah Kee.

556
00:44:03,383 --> 00:44:05,220
Hello .. Mr Ah Kee?

557
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,316
Hello, Ling Moy.

558
00:44:08,288 --> 00:44:09,273
Forgive me.

559
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,734
I am sailing tomorrow.

560
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:13,987
I've called to say goodbye.

561
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:15,955
Oh, Ling Moy.

562
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,326
I must see you tomorrow before you go.

563
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,471
I am afraid there will not be time.

564
00:44:21,113 --> 00:44:22,500
But tonight then, for a moment?

565
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,573
Ling Moy, please I must.

566
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:27,597
Ling Moy will be waiting.

567
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:29,421
Alright.

568
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,271
I will be right over.

569
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,965
I am going to the Morloff house.

570
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,772
Keep your eye on him while I'm gone.

571
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:43,111
Oh, certainly.

572
00:44:43,421 --> 00:44:45,339
And .. if anything should happen.

573
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,407
You will phone for me immediately.

574
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,386
Rather.
- I won't be long.

575
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:06,867
My Mistress will be here soon.

576
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:10,762
She bids you wear this
robe of your Eastern rank.

577
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,727
Your heart still bears the
soft elegance of China.

578
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:55,706
I kneel.

579
00:45:56,674 --> 00:45:57,868
Not to our own customs.

580
00:45:59,402 --> 00:46:00,890
But to your beauty.

581
00:46:02,865 --> 00:46:03,533
Come.

582
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,520
Sit beside me here.

583
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,469
Oh .. oh.

584
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,757
Have you found it yet?
- Yes.

585
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:19,270
No.

586
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:24,992
It all came of having
indecently exposed the Queen.

587
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:26,673
Here.

588
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:30,090
Indecent is the word.
- Yes .. isn't it.

589
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:32,217
Petrie .. Petrie!

590
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:38,364
Ling Moy .. has been kidnapped.

591
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:41,279
What's that?
- Lu Chung has got her.

592
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:43,852
Find Ah Kee.

593
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:45,321
Ah Kee has followed them.

594
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:48,939
He said to phone Scotland Yard
and raid Lu Chung's place.

595
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,076
Raid Lu Chung's place?
- Hurry man.

596
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:52,524
It may be too late.

597
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:56,551
Flinders. Get my coat, will you.
- Yes, sir.

598
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:59,367
Petrie .. I trust you with this.
- Yes.

599
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:03,134
I must go back. Hurry, please.
- Yes of course, old man.

600
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,193
Rogers.

601
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,628
Get Sir Basil. Tell him to meet me
at Lu Chung's with raiding squad.

602
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,378
Understand?
- You understand, Flinders?

603
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:12,904
They're to meet Mr Ronald at
Lu Chung's with the raiding party.

604
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:15,540
Telephone Miss Marshall and ask her
to come here and stay with mother.

605
00:47:15,795 --> 00:47:18,479
Telephone Miss Marshall?
I told you to telephone, Rogers.

606
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,906
Well, I am going with you, sir.
I have a score to settle.

607
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:22,026
Don't be absurd.

608
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,961
Now just wait a minute. I'll just
get my muffler and a weapon.

609
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:27,187
Now make those calls,
Flinders. Make those calls.

610
00:47:27,459 --> 00:47:28,473
Yes, sir.

611
00:47:29,131 --> 00:47:31,174
Get me Scotland Yard please.

612
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,827
Have you made the calls?
- I'm just making them, sir.

613
00:47:34,024 --> 00:47:35,411
Well hurry, hurry.
- Yes, sir.

614
00:47:57,969 --> 00:47:58,796
They come.

615
00:48:01,728 --> 00:48:02,917
Here is Mr Petrie, sir.

616
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:07,426
Hurry, Sir Basil. We may be too late.
- Is Ah Kee with you?

617
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:09,564
No. He went ahead. He may be inside.

618
00:48:19,568 --> 00:48:21,027
You are too late I hope.

619
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:23,149
My hat, Rogers! Go home!

620
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,744
Not until I deal a blow or two.

621
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:27,470
Look out, sir.

622
00:48:33,857 --> 00:48:35,307
Hobbs! Check the back door.

623
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:37,795
And where does that lead?

624
00:48:46,187 --> 00:48:47,790
Stay where you are.

625
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,546
Go down here.

626
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,610
I'm coming! Come on, Mr Ronald.

627
00:49:06,261 --> 00:49:07,528
Here they are.

628
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:15,259
That way! Come on.

629
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:16,807
There he is!

630
00:49:25,192 --> 00:49:26,195
Ling Moy!

631
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:27,919
Ling Moy!

632
00:49:31,306 --> 00:49:32,485
Ling Moy!

633
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:33,851
Ling Moy!

634
00:49:44,793 --> 00:49:46,005
Hobbs! Hobbs!

635
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,361
Listen .. I'm inside.

636
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,075
This looks like a false lead.
- That's my opinion, sir.

637
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:02,146
Where is Petrie?
- He wasn't with me, sir.

638
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:03,719
He went the other way, with Dixon.

639
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:04,983
I'll call him.

640
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:07,875
Dixon .. Dixon.

641
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,553
Dixon!
- Coming, sir.

642
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,003
He's coming up.

643
00:50:11,362 --> 00:50:12,096
Dixon.

644
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:15,175
Where is Petrie?
- Why ..

645
00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:17,251
I thought he came back up here, sir.

646
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,030
He's been trapped.

647
00:50:19,456 --> 00:50:22,829
Carney, get every available man
you can and follow us immediately.

648
00:50:23,072 --> 00:50:23,983
Right, sir.

649
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,545
If we were always together.

650
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:09,295
Would not Ah Kee grow
weary of everlasting beauty?

651
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,231
No.

652
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:14,164
In his paradise.

653
00:51:15,137 --> 00:51:16,876
He would grow as fat as the Buddha.

654
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:19,223
That's too fat.

655
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:21,231
I should stop loving Ah Kee.

656
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,362
And only pray to him.

657
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:26,767
Then .. lean in hunger.

658
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,063
For more and more we are beauties.

659
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:32,576
Lin Moy.

660
00:51:33,643 --> 00:51:36,434
I cannot bear to see
you go away from me.

661
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:56,175
Ling Moy.

662
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,166
You do love me?

663
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:01,198
Too much, Ah Kee.

664
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,608
Then you will let me
take you away to China?

665
00:52:04,472 --> 00:52:06,344
To the land of our ancestors.

666
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:15,664
Ling Moy.

667
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:20,363
You do not answer.

668
00:52:22,146 --> 00:52:24,275
Is there a doubt?
- No.

669
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:28,032
Before I answer you.
I shall go to the altar.

670
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:30,068
And thank them for this gift.

671
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:32,371
Then thank them too.

672
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:34,587
In the name of Ah Kee.

673
00:53:05,926 --> 00:53:09,722
The fruit of your
ingenious plan, Princess.

674
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,567
Lu Chung, is all admiration.

675
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,965
And this time, there
will be no turning aside.

676
00:53:20,048 --> 00:53:21,037
And now.

677
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:23,411
These clumsy fingers itch.

678
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:25,619
To dispose of Mr Ah Kee.

679
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:29,498
He will be put away until we
are free of England tonight.

680
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,758
Permanently put away, of course?
- There is no need to kill.

681
00:53:32,996 --> 00:53:35,398
We must ensure our escape.
- You may trust me for that.

682
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,148
But Princes ..
- I have spoken.

683
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:39,303
Amah, the wine.

684
00:54:25,616 --> 00:54:27,548
Heaven smiled upon our fates.

685
00:54:31,832 --> 00:54:33,318
The greatness of the moment.

686
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,387
Confuses Ah Kee.

687
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:39,061
In this wine, we pledge our troth.

688
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:42,134
Ah Kee pledges his love.

689
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:45,485
And his life to Ling Moy.

690
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:48,434
And in return ..

691
00:54:48,904 --> 00:54:51,357
He gives the counterfeit of love!

692
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:58,732
Why have you poisoned
the wine, and our love?

693
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,275
It is an unworthy suspicion.

694
00:55:01,973 --> 00:55:03,307
What is Lu Chung doing here?

695
00:55:04,214 --> 00:55:05,669
What do you want with Petrie?

696
00:55:06,398 --> 00:55:08,302
Why is he lying senseless there?

697
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,853
One answer will serve for everything.

698
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,231
I am the daughter of Fu Manchu.

699
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:17,644
You?

700
00:55:26,933 --> 00:55:29,779
You will not kill him.
- By my sacred oath.

701
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,643
But an oath .. should
never have been sworn.

702
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:35,099
I tell you to release him.

703
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:36,920
That cannot be.
- I warn you.

704
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,793
I have a duty to Scotland Yard.

705
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:45,090
Consider carefully
before you leave to do it.

706
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:48,025
If you try, and I'm forced to leave.
They will kill you.

707
00:55:48,861 --> 00:55:50,891
I do not want your blood on my hands.

708
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:55,535
I cannot delay.

709
00:55:57,998 --> 00:55:59,300
But I see before me.

710
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:02,228
The magnet of your house.

711
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:04,246
We shall search out
these things, Ah Kee.

712
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:06,914
Remember only, that you love me.

713
00:56:07,726 --> 00:56:08,806
Whoever I am.

714
00:56:09,521 --> 00:56:12,439
I always hated the name of Fu Manchu.

715
00:56:12,677 --> 00:56:14,517
Forget that hate. I am a woman.

716
00:56:15,155 --> 00:56:16,743
Where is your hatred against our love?

717
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:18,969
Against our eternal day together.

718
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:22,255
It is the triumph of irony.

719
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,493
That the only woman
I have ever deeply loved.

720
00:56:27,602 --> 00:56:30,153
Should be born of blood that I loathe.

721
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:32,458
Look into my eyes, Ah Kee.

722
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:35,091
And see us already
sailing home to China.

723
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:36,895
To the place you know.

724
00:56:37,588 --> 00:56:39,321
Where the flowers smother the fields.

725
00:56:41,726 --> 00:56:44,777
Would you love .. a dishonoured Ah Kee?

726
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:46,185
Forever.

727
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:50,971
And I would forever despise him.

728
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:53,394
Finish Petrie.

729
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:55,194
You honest fool.

730
00:56:56,274 --> 00:56:59,854
It was not for myself, but for your own
life that I played in love with you.

731
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,520
You have chosen to die.

732
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,394
Get him!

733
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:23,753
Stand back, Morloff.

734
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:16,914
Mr Morloff.

735
00:58:17,146 --> 00:58:18,284
Shush.

736
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:22,715
What's happened?
- Are you alone?

737
00:58:23,894 --> 00:58:25,665
Come here .. I need your help.

738
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,207
Do not his manners plead for death?

739
00:58:49,645 --> 00:58:50,993
Tie him up.
- But Princess.

740
00:58:51,254 --> 00:58:52,613
Quick Lu Chung. We waste time.

741
00:58:52,927 --> 00:58:54,537
Take him to the attic.
- Yes.

742
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,857
Chair.

743
00:59:20,142 --> 00:59:21,972
Now, we go to the cellar.

744
00:59:41,243 --> 00:59:43,126
Ronald .. Ronald.

745
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:45,986
Ling Moy.

746
00:59:47,806 --> 00:59:48,935
I was afraid.

747
00:59:50,397 --> 00:59:51,945
Oh you are safe, then?

748
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:55,897
What happened to me?

749
00:59:56,557 --> 00:59:57,922
Ling Moy rescued you.

750
00:59:58,607 --> 00:59:59,506
For her own.

751
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,210
These lights they are ..

752
01:00:04,116 --> 01:00:05,392
Swimming in my brain.

753
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,633
I've never seen you looking
more softly beautiful.

754
01:00:17,765 --> 01:00:18,609
That's Joan.

755
01:00:20,668 --> 01:00:21,798
What's she doing here?

756
01:00:22,972 --> 01:00:24,327
What's happening to her?

757
01:00:27,277 --> 01:00:28,779
Answer me! What's happening to her?

758
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:30,894
Can you think of her now?

759
01:00:33,912 --> 01:00:35,530
Why is she screaming like that?

760
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:38,609
You refuse the gift of Ling Moy's heart?

761
01:00:40,981 --> 01:00:41,858
Very well.

762
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:47,527
I will take you to her.

763
01:00:48,548 --> 01:00:49,398
Follow me.

764
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,229
Joan, where are you?

765
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:02,843
Joan, what is it?

766
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:04,637
Morloff, what's happening?

767
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,754
Joan, my darling. What
have they done to you?

768
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:12,636
Oh, it's Morloff.

769
01:01:13,328 --> 01:01:14,343
Morloff!

770
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:15,927
Why, you ..

771
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,135
What's the meaning of this,
Ling Moy? Are you mad?

772
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:28,941
Look into my eyes.

773
01:01:29,935 --> 01:01:31,395
Set her free, do you hear me.

774
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,771
Ling Moy. I can't believe such
loathsome jealousy in you.

775
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:39,060
No love now.

776
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:41,092
No jealousy.

777
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:44,541
Just merciless vengeance.

778
01:01:45,852 --> 01:01:48,045
You will understand when
I tell you, Ronald Petrie.

779
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:52,387
I am the daughter of Fu Manchu.

780
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,279
You?

781
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,692
You death tonight washes
the stain from my house.

782
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,387
Alright .. you can do
what you like with me.

783
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:07,870
But why do you hold Joan?

784
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:10,851
Because you must have
a thousand bitter tastes.

785
01:02:11,483 --> 01:02:13,454
Of death .. before you die.

786
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:16,838
Tie him up.

787
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:33,512
My vengeance is inspired tonight.

788
01:02:38,558 --> 01:02:40,997
You'll have first have the
torture of seeing her beauty ..

789
01:02:41,206 --> 01:02:44,175
Eaten slowly away by this hungry acid.

790
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:50,995
You wouldn't dare to that!

791
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:52,940
Prepare.

792
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:58,839
Flinders .. Flinders, see who that is.
- Yes, milady.

793
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:06,312
Lady Petrie .. has Ronald shown up yet?

794
01:03:06,412 --> 01:03:08,114
I thought he was with you.
- Well he was.

795
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:10,281
Rogers.
- Oh, they've got Ronald.

796
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,707
Go upstairs and don't worry.

797
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:22,434
We are going to have a talk.

798
01:03:23,075 --> 01:03:24,720
With Mr Morloff. Come along, Hobbs.

799
01:03:49,582 --> 01:03:50,753
Mr Morloff, please.

800
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:52,797
Go away. I am alone.
- Oh.

801
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:55,827
Nobody here?
- Nobody.

802
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:07,187
Do you believe her, sir?

803
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,908
I think Morloff is in there.
- Of course he is.

804
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:11,448
She's a bad liar.

805
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:14,046
No, no .. they may be watching us.

806
01:04:14,395 --> 01:04:15,725
We'll go to the Petrie House.

807
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:17,621
And work from there. Come on.

808
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:31,224
Great heavens! It's Ah Kee.

809
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:56,418
That's alright, Ah Kee.

810
01:04:57,954 --> 01:04:58,626
Quick.

811
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:00,916
They are killing them.

812
01:05:01,802 --> 01:05:02,808
Killing them.

813
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:06,350
Quick, you fellows.
Carry him into the Petrie house.

814
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:09,135
Hobbs. Tony.

815
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,599
Quick. All of you, follow me.

816
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:14,822
It is ready.

817
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:17,196
Morloff, revive her.

818
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:27,704
Oh, Ronnie.

819
01:05:32,135 --> 01:05:34,348
Stop it, Ling Moy! In heaven's name.

820
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:35,729
It's inhuman.

821
01:05:35,972 --> 01:05:37,561
Oh Ronnie, don't let them do it.

822
01:05:38,127 --> 01:05:39,536
Anything but that.

823
01:05:40,935 --> 01:05:42,610
Anything but that.
- Stop!

824
01:05:45,556 --> 01:05:46,907
Ling Moy is merciful.

825
01:05:48,068 --> 01:05:49,904
Lao .. untie his arms.

826
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:51,992
The knife.

827
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:57,178
Kill her.

828
01:05:58,714 --> 01:05:59,442
No.

829
01:06:00,746 --> 01:06:02,075
Oh please kill me, Ronnie.

830
01:06:02,602 --> 01:06:04,141
I'd rather die that way.

831
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,640
No, no, no!

832
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:13,485
They've found us, they've found us!

833
01:06:13,687 --> 01:06:15,842
They've found us, they've found us!

834
01:06:24,218 --> 01:06:25,335
No, no .. the acid!

835
01:06:26,127 --> 01:06:28,000
Shoot! Kill that man! Shoot!

836
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,901
Ronald, you alright?

837
01:06:40,001 --> 01:06:41,996
I'm alright, Sir Basil.
Take care of Joan.

838
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:48,365
Basil.
- What is it?

839
01:06:48,465 --> 01:06:50,272
We got them all but
the girl and Lu Chung.

840
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:51,852
Don't let her escape, Sir Basil.

841
01:06:51,952 --> 01:06:54,101
They disappeared as if they'd
walked through the walls.

842
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:56,839
Nonsense. They must be in the
house. Come along, Hobbs.

843
01:06:56,939 --> 01:06:58,249
Walked through the walls?

844
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:01,163
Ronald .. I know where they've gone.
- What on earth are you talking about?

845
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:03,508
They've walked through the walls.
I know where they've gone.

846
01:07:03,676 --> 01:07:05,555
What?
- That night the intruders came.

847
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:08,505
I thought I saw someone
disappearing. Oh do come with me.

848
01:07:09,807 --> 01:07:11,853
Take care of Miss Marshall.
Bring her into the house.

849
01:07:16,024 --> 01:07:17,795
Ronnie .. Ronnie!

850
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:29,418
Turn out those lights.

851
01:07:29,935 --> 01:07:32,206
When I shout, turn them all off.

852
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:47,474
Lights!

853
01:07:49,438 --> 01:07:50,462
Put up your hands!

854
01:07:54,231 --> 01:07:55,553
Stop Ling Moy! Stop.

855
01:07:55,808 --> 01:07:57,047
I got him.
- Good man.

856
01:07:58,439 --> 01:07:59,340
Get Sir Basil.

857
01:08:00,241 --> 01:08:01,627
I'll take care of her.

858
01:08:12,854 --> 01:08:13,952
Let me surrender.

859
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:17,253
In the spirit of the House of Fu.

860
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:24,366
Ronald.
- Joan.

861
01:08:39,612 --> 01:08:40,870
Did you hear that?

862
01:08:41,444 --> 01:08:42,577
What's happened?

863
01:08:46,647 --> 01:08:48,847
Steady .. steady, Ah Kee.

864
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:02,094
Lover.

865
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:03,886
Ling Moy.

866
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:09,075
But lovers .. need not .. love.

867
01:09:10,654 --> 01:09:11,819
But only ..

868
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:13,731
Be loved.

869
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:17,226
But Ah Kee ..

870
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:19,414
Loved you.

871
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:09,733
- tg-
