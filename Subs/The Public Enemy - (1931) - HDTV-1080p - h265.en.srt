1
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:50,383
Larry, give me one of those empty jars.

2
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:53,800
Fill them up, will you?

3
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:14,816
Extra!

4
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,739
Read all about it!

5
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,117
Give us a swig.

6
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,758
- Hello, Tommy.
- Hello.

7
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:17,716
Can grease?

8
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,423
Come on, Matt. We got business.

9
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,178
Give us a little kiss.

10
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:28,847
That's what you get
for fooling with women.

11
00:04:34,363 --> 00:04:38,147
Hey, little boy, stop.
Stop, I say! Stop that!

12
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,632
Officer, get those boys.

13
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:00,090
Don't let them escape!
if I get a hold of you...

14
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:15,271
Matt, look.

15
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:17,779
That ain't fair, Tom.

16
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:21,030
- What do you care? It's only a girl.
- She's my sister, ain't she?

17
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:22,825
What difference does that make?

18
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,244
Help me up, Matt.

19
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:28,282
Leave her alone. She's doing fine.
That's the way to learn.

20
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:36,291
That's just like you, Tom Powers.
You're the meanest boy in town.

21
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,457
He is not.
He give you his skates, didn't he?

22
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,468
I believe he did it
just so he could play that trick on me.

23
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:44,720
- I'm gonna tell your brother Mike.
- Go ahead and tell him.

24
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:46,466
Here he comes now.

25
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:48,218
You'll help me, won't you, Mike?

26
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,060
- Where'd you get the skates, Molly?
- Tom gave them to me.

27
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:53,601
Tom did? Where'd you get them, Tom?

28
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,607
He got them from a kid
who owed him some money.

29
00:05:57,944 --> 00:06:01,277
I'll bet you stole them, Tom.
Give them back, Molly.

30
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:03,656
Why don't you mind your own business?

31
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,864
Nobody asked you
to put your two cents in.

32
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,615
Here, Tom.
I don't want them if you stole them.

33
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:11,575
- So you're getting like sissy Mike, too.
- Take them, Tom.

34
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,619
You ain't so darn good.
Your old man swipes pigeons.

35
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,209
Tom Powers, he does not!
You're a big liar.

36
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:21,001
He's in jail.
They don't put people there for nothing.

37
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:23,130
Everybody who belongs there, ain't there.

38
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:25,791
That's where you'll be someday,
Tom Powers.

39
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:29,552
I ain't there yet.
if I do go, it won't be for swiping pigeons.

40
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,062
Tell him you were only kidding, Tom.

41
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,212
How do you want them this time:
up or down?

42
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,183
Three for me, too. Three skins.

43
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,934
- Hello there.
- How's it going?

44
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,430
How are you?

45
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:02,598
Hit you. There you are.

46
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,059
- Hit me again.
- Hit you. There's one.

47
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,942
Hit you again. There you go.

48
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,080
Hey, Putty Nose.

49
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,200
All right. I'll be back in a minute, boys.

50
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:29,589
Hello, boys. What's up?

51
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,465
- We've got something.
- Really?

52
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:33,840
Fine. I'll bet you a nickel.

53
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,770
- Where'd you get them?
- Wentworth Avenue.

54
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:47,267
How much are they worth?

55
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,480
Not much. Just cheap watches.

56
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,152
- Cheap watches? $1 apiece.
- Yeah, and there's six of them, too.

57
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,812
I don't know what I can do with them.
They're hot.

58
00:08:56,909 --> 00:09:00,657
Come on. Quit stalling, Putty Nose.
You know how to sell them.

59
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:02,370
You're too smart.

60
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:06,417
- I'll see what I can do with them.
- How much do we get?

61
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:10,830
What do you say to 50 cents
for each of them?

62
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:15,300
- 50 cents?
- I ain't cheating you. That's a good price.

63
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:20,169
I have to take all the risk,
and maybe I can't sell them at all.

64
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:21,640
Give us the 50 cents.

65
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:27,057
You know old Putty Nose always
plays on the square with you, don't you?

66
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:30,480
- This is only two bits.
- Yeah, and this is only a nickel.

67
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:33,818
- My mistake.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,065
All right.

69
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,364
You both owe me a month's dues
to the club, don't you?

70
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:41,403
- That's right, Tom.
- So we're calling that square, see?

71
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,735
- That's all right, isn't it?
- Sure.

72
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:46,740
You've done a good stroke of business.

73
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,541
And if you find anything more...

74
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:52,416
you'll just remember old Putty Nose,
won't you?

75
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:54,295
Okay. Let's scram.

76
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:29,662
What do we want with
a couple of young squirts like them for?

77
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:32,122
They ain't gonna be so bad.

78
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:35,785
They won't expect much of a cut.

79
00:10:37,965 --> 00:10:40,207
- Hey there, Tom.
- Hello, Putty Nose.

80
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:41,546
Hello, boys.

81
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,090
Are you alone?

82
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,638
I'm always alone when I'm with Matt.

83
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:51,144
You looking for a sock on the button?

84
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:55,728
I was afraid you might have
brought Mike with you.

85
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:59,525
That sucker.
He's too busy going to school.

86
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:02,359
He's learning how to be poor.

87
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:07,822
Ain't he working
on the streetcars anymore?

88
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:11,990
Sure. He's a ding-ding in the daytime,
goes to school at night.

89
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:14,367
What do you want us for, Putty?

90
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,995
Something sweet.

91
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:24,794
Remember how I always said...

92
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,306
when I got something good, I'd cut you in?

93
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:51,280
Now, Dutch here knows the whole layout.

94
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,366
We've been casing the joint
for a whole week.

95
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,916
- How about the cops?
- You ain't afraid of cops.

96
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,461
There ain't gonna be no trouble...

97
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:06,379
and if there is,
I promise you that I'll protect you.

98
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:11,424
Now, Limpy here will be lookout.

99
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,717
The place is dead at night, anyhow.

100
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,677
Well, are you on?

101
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:24,141
- We ain't never done nothing so big.
- "Big" is right.

102
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:27,273
I'm giving you a break, like I promised.

103
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,280
Furs is worth plenty nowadays.

104
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,367
How about you, Tom?

105
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:39,072
- It's kind of new stuff for me.
- You gotta grow up sometime.

106
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,622
Wait a minute.

107
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:48,256
Christmas present from Santa Claus.

108
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:52,671
With best wishes
for a prosperous new year.

109
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,300
- I'm scared stiff.
- Come on, ain't nothing to be scared of.

110
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:39,508
Is that so?
Look at you, you're shaking yourself.

111
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,658
Take it off me, will you?

112
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:29,928
Stop!

113
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,436
You tried to get away, did you?

114
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:37,446
They got Limpy Larry.

115
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:52,450
Stop there!

116
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:28,493
- Where's that big loony?
- Where's Putty? We knocked off aâ€”

117
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,035
Yeah, I know all about it.

118
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,045
Putty Nose beat it.
You better lay low for a while.

119
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,172
The heat's on.

120
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:41,791
But Putty Nose got us into this.
He promised to see us through.

121
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:44,506
Why, that dirty, no-good,
yellow-bellied stool.

122
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:48,179
I'm gonna give it to him right in the head
the first time I see him.

123
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,721
Yeah? You and who else?

124
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,705
My Larry.

125
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,955
He was a good boy.

126
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,586
Larry got what he asked for. I warned him.

127
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:28,259
He was a no-good boy.

128
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:33,172
My Larry was a good boy.

129
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:36,764
He got into bad company, that's all.

130
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,563
Come here, Tommy boy.

131
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:42,064
I'm so glad you came, Tommy.

132
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:46,732
Mrs. Dalton will be pleased to see
some of Larry's nicer friends.

133
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:16,343
"U.S. declares war." Read all about it!

134
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,317
Wait a minute, Tom. Here comes Mike.

135
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:35,282
Extra! Read all about it.

136
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,830
You should come on home with me, Molly.
I don't know just how to tell Mom.

137
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:42,160
All right, Mike.

138
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:49,007
That sister of yours
ain't getting any bargain in Mike.

139
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:50,799
How come he ain't working?

140
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:53,554
I guess he got fired
for snatching too many nickels.

141
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,215
- They look like something's happened.
- Come on, we gotta see Paddy.

142
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:00,600
You don't need to stall
with Paddy Ryan, Tom.

143
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:05,183
I've been watching you ever since
you bought your first drink from me.

144
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:07,397
I know what you been doing.

145
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,729
You see, Paddy, it's like this.

146
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,820
We delivered some cigars today.
Must be worth about $2,500.

147
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:16,156
Took them to a place on 63rd
and was told to put them in the back.

148
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:19,943
- We could lift them easy tonight.
- But we don't know what to do with them.

149
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,993
You sell cigars, don't you?

150
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:32,882
Not that kind. Can't afford it.

151
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:38,585
I've got my own system, boys,
but being a fence ain't part of it.

152
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:41,801
- We thought maybe you know somebody.
- Maybe I do.

153
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,814
You might take them there.

154
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,402
- I'll call up and say you're coming.
- Thanks, Paddy.

155
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:00,701
Wait a minute.

156
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:10,126
if you get in a jam, give me a ring.
You'll find out Paddy Ryan's your friend.

157
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:12,041
Thanks, Paddy.

158
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,581
Why do you want to front for us?
We ain't never done nothing for you.

159
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,004
Maybe not.

160
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,050
But I may need a friend myself sometime.

161
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,385
I'm older than you...

162
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:25,973
and I've learned that nobody can do much
without somebody else.

163
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:29,306
Remember this, boys:
You gotta have friends.

164
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:34,815
I've been watching and hearing about you,
and I've been worried.

165
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:38,817
I was worried when you got mixed up
with that two-timer Putty Nose.

166
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:41,149
Such guys are dangerous.

167
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:48,496
I'm glad you come to me.

168
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,162
As far as I'm concerned,
there's only two kinds of people:

169
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,533
right and wrong.

170
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,498
Now, I think you're right.

171
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:59,923
You'll find that I am, unless you cross me.

172
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,595
That's swell.

173
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,765
Don't cry. Everything will be all right.

174
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:24,569
Hello, Ma.

175
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:30,746
Tommy boy.
You won't leave me, will you, Tommy?

176
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:33,583
You're all I've got left now, Tommy boy.

177
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:36,914
What's the matter, Ma? What's up?

178
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:39,421
Mike's enlisted.

179
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,258
Enlisted? In the Army?

180
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:46,674
- In the Marines.
- But you won't go, Tommy.

181
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:50,298
Promise me you won't go.
You're just a baby.

182
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,475
Now, listen, Maâ€”

183
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:55,562
if your pa was alive,
I wouldn't care so much.

184
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,480
Promise me, Tommy.

185
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:02,605
I won't go, Ma. When's he going?

186
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,572
As soon as he gets his call.

187
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,445
He's up packing now.

188
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,618
Go up and see him, Tommy.

189
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:16,204
We ought to be very proud of him.

190
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,341
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello, Tom.

191
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,508
I'm glad you came. I suppose you've heard.

192
00:21:32,683 --> 00:21:34,676
Yeah. Kind of rushing it, ain't you?

193
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:37,638
Well, Tom, when your country needs you,
she needs you.

194
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,893
I suppose you think I ought to go, too.

195
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:47,188
No. Maybe it was selfish of me, Tom...

196
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:49,778
but somebody's got to stay here
and take care of Ma.

197
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:53,318
You earn more money than I do,
and they'd have called me first anyway.

198
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,785
- You always did get all the breaks.
- Don't take it like that, Tom.

199
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,835
You've got to be
the man of the family now.

200
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:11,338
And while we're on the subject, I wish
you'd try to stay home a little more.

201
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,921
- I gotta work, ain't l?
- Sure.

202
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:26,104
Listen, I was in a place today,
and I heard somebody say something.

203
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:29,648
- What of it?
- Well, they were saying...

204
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:33,572
It seemed as though they were
pointing a finger at you and Matt.

205
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:36,031
Who was?
What rat would say anything about meâ€”

206
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,317
Now take it easy.

207
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:40,116
You're always hearing things.

208
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:43,493
You'll get too much in your nose someday
and wonder how you got it.

209
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,420
For crying out loud,
I heard some guys talking about you...

210
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,461
saying you were in on some crooked work.

211
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,706
What am I supposed to do? Run?

212
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,098
You ain't asking me, you're telling me.

213
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,890
And I don't know a thing, see?

214
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,728
All I've got to say is that
you've got a good job now.

215
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:05,054
You don't need these rats
you're running with.

216
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:08,267
You want me to go to night school
and read poems.

217
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,852
I've been hearing a few things myself.

218
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:14,650
- There's nothing to hear about me.
- That's all you know.

219
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,492
You ain't so smart.
Books don't hide everything.

220
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:21,277
- You're a liar. You're covering up.
- Covering up for what? For you?

221
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,910
- You're nothing but a sneak thief.
- What did you say?

222
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,949
You heard me, a petty larceny sneak thief.
Robbing the streetcar company.

223
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:08,931
Don't you think that
booze ain't gonna be valuable.

224
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:13,430
I heard today that
alcohol's gone to $30 a gallon.

225
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,601
The real McCoy's hard to get.

226
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:23,812
All you gotta do
when you deliver a good shipment...

227
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:26,528
is size up the layout and let me know.

228
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:28,232
I can use some of it.

229
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:35,782
I know two or three others
that'll buy all that I can't handle.

230
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:40,169
It means real dough, a three-way split.

231
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:44,003
I said we'd get together sometime,
didn't l?

232
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:46,964
Well, the time has come now.

233
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:07,866
Grab the rope.
One jerk to start, and two to stop.

234
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,493
Thanks, Hymie.

235
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:36,672
There.

236
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,546
- Are you satisfied?
- I'll say.

237
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:45,017
Pretty soft, wasn't it?

238
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:47,887
How do you like playing with Paddy?

239
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,645
- I wonder what to do with so much dough.
- You ain't started.

240
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:54,061
I'll make big shots out of you yet.

241
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:56,857
- Anything you say goes for me, Paddy.
- Me, too.

242
00:28:57,531 --> 00:28:59,322
And here's to us.

243
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:08,243
31.5 inches.

244
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,167
Don't forget, plenty of room in there.

245
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:16,547
Sir. Here's where you need the room.
Such a muscle.

246
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,875
Make it snappy
or you'll find out what it's for.

247
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:22,302
- Yeah, come on. Let's get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:25,841
22.5 inches.

249
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:33,562
Did you read about that big robbery
at the booze warehouse?

250
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,482
42.5 inches.

251
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,983
- Right under their very noses.
- Yeah, a guy was just telling me about it.

252
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,072
33.5 inches.

253
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,202
if those men get away with that,
they'll be rich for life.

254
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,919
37.5 inches.

255
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:03,843
Did you read what it said
in the papers? 150,000.

256
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,427
150,000.

257
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,051
Dollars.

258
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:11,180
Why don't you two mugs
get an adding machine?

259
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:14,056
All through now, gentlemen. Thank you.

260
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,560
Don't forget what I told you.
Plenty of room there.

261
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,856
Yeah, and remember: six buttons.

262
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:24,487
Be careful, Matt, or you're going to
cut the nose right off of you.

263
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:42,089
- if it ain't Mr. Tom and Mr. Matt.
- Hello, George. How's business?

264
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,882
- Big night.
- Good.

265
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,221
Hey, stoop, that's got gears!
It ain't no Ford!

266
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,890
Okay, boss.

267
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:25,000
Mr. Powers, Mr. Doyle. Alone as usual?

268
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,961
I am, but Matt's all fixed up.
He's got me with him.

269
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,594
The night's young yet.

270
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,047
- You'll wind up with something.
- Yeah, with the morning paper.

271
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:47,358
- Couple of lightweights.
- Yeah, flat tires.

272
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:15,426
Why don't you send them
home to their mothers?

273
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:19,049
- They're no good to the joint anymore.
- And the ladies, too?

274
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:21,722
Don't be silly.

275
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:34,692
How about something with ice in it?

276
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,530
Well, we're with friends.

277
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:48,546
Yeah, I know it. I'm one of them.

278
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,711
Hello, baby.

279
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:57,219
- What are you going to have?
- Anything you say, big boy.

280
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,557
You're a swell dish.
I think I'm going to go for you.

281
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:05,677
- Look at what I got measured for.
- I don't even know you're here.

282
00:33:15,197 --> 00:33:16,774
Come on.

283
00:33:21,161 --> 00:33:22,905
Then it's a deal?

284
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:26,739
if you can assure me
my name will be protected.

285
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:29,241
You'll be protected all over the place.

286
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:31,747
Hello, boys.

287
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:36,292
You can take off those clothes.
You got new jobs.

288
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:43,056
First, meet Mr. Leehman.

289
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,885
These are the two lads
I was telling you about.

290
00:33:50,023 --> 00:33:51,481
Sit down, boys.

291
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:57,902
How do you like the brewery business?

292
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:00,195
- We don't know nothing about it.
- You will.

293
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:02,320
You're in it now.

294
00:34:03,953 --> 00:34:06,325
Mr. Leehman and I got it all fixed.

295
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,199
Mr. Leehman owns that big brewery
over on Union Avenue.

296
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,712
- But that's been closed sinceâ€”
- Yeah. It's going to open up.

297
00:34:19,802 --> 00:34:23,799
You spoke of a rather remarkable man
from the West Side.

298
00:34:25,473 --> 00:34:26,802
Nails Nathan.

299
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:32,432
- Paddy, is Nails throwing in with us?
- He'll be here any minute.

300
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,895
I don't believe I'm acquainted
with the gentleman.

301
00:34:36,985 --> 00:34:39,819
Then you're the only man in town
that ain't.

302
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:42,062
At least everybody's heard of him, boys.

303
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:49,246
Believe me, Mr. Leehman,
when Nails and his mob start on a job...

304
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:52,373
it's already done.

305
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,626
That Schemer Burns' crowd
tries to muscle in on us...

306
00:34:58,214 --> 00:34:59,624
I pity them.

307
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:04,591
You understand that my desire is merely
to furnish a better grade of beer...

308
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,635
than the working man can now obtain...

309
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,889
- under the present, unfortunateâ€”
- In your hat.

310
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:14,136
And again in your hat, mister.

311
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,305
I've heard that north wind blow before.

312
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,683
if you're in this, you're in for the coins,
same as the rest of us.

313
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:22,611
- Gentlemen, meet Nails Nathan.
- Born Samuel.

314
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,939
Tom Powers, glad to know you.

315
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,567
And you're Matt Doyle.

316
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,900
- How are you? Sit down, fellas.
- How'd you know?

317
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,200
Know all about you.
Paddy has been talking.

318
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:32,954
Meet Mr. Leehman, Nails.

319
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,158
Tickled pink. Don't take offense
at anything I say, Mr. Leehman.

320
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,834
if we're in this racket together,
we got to keep the cheaters off, right?

321
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,083
My name is not to appearâ€”

322
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,627
Don't worry.
We won't use it in our advertising.

323
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:46,503
Paddy, the mob's all ready
by the time you can open.

324
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:50,426
Got some swell routes laid out for you,
and the stock's all marked.

325
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:53,255
You mean,
you have the customers all signed up?

326
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,343
- Signed up?
- Yes, sir.

327
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,894
Signed up or sealed up.

328
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:01,607
Tom and Matt here
is the official signers and sealers.

329
00:36:01,691 --> 00:36:04,266
- The trouble squad.
- And if they need any help...

330
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:08,275
Nails has got some pretty handy boys
with their gloves all oiled.

331
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:09,949
Dear me, I'm afraid this meansâ€”

332
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,987
It means they buy our beer
or they don't buy any beer.

333
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:26,379
All right, Dutch, get going.

334
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,040
And don't take any back talk
from those speakies.

335
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:33,003
Tell them, "Here's the beer you ordered."
if they doubt you, call Matt and Tom.

336
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:35,469
All right, Matt, Tom, get going.

337
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:04,495
- Hello, Steve. How's business?
- Business?

338
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:06,546
Business is on the bum.

339
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:09,963
That's with telling us
you only took two kegs of beer last trip...

340
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,050
- but now you don't want any at all.
- Business is on the bum.

341
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:16,966
Give us a couple of beers.
That'll help a little.

342
00:37:29,193 --> 00:37:31,519
- That ain't our beer.
- Where'd you get this slop?

343
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:34,186
It's good, ain't it?
And it's cheaper than yours.

344
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:36,108
How much you paying for this stuff?

345
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,739
- Two bits a glass.
- All right. Screw.

346
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:45,581
I thought so.
You can sell ours for the same price.

347
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,055
Get your hands off that!

348
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,014
Somebody's got to protect
your customers.

349
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:06,435
What can I do? I can't help it
if I have to buy from Schemer Burns.

350
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:10,056
- They tell me the same thing that you do.
- You're yellow.

351
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,941
Please, you ain't gonna slug me, are you?

352
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:17,942
Maybe not today.
But I'm telling you this for the last time.

353
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:19,942
When Dutch comes,
he will leave some beer.

354
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,869
You're going to take it
and kick in with the dough.

355
00:38:22,954 --> 00:38:26,951
if you don't, somebody will come and kick
your teeth out one at a time. Get me?

356
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,291
You'll be needing some right away.
How many should we leave?

357
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:34,043
- Two kegs.
- You hear that, Dutch? Bring in five kegs.

358
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,259
"Mr. And Mrs. Patrick J. Ryan."

359
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:49,929
"Mr. And Mrs. Bernard Grogan."

360
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,851
"Welcome home, Michael Powers."

361
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:00,900
"Samuel Nathan"?

362
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:07,495
I never heard of him.

363
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:12,206
Nails Nathan. One of Tom's new friends.

364
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:16,502
What's Tom doing now, Pat?

365
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,707
Mother said something
about a political job.

366
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,421
Yeah? And that ain't all.

367
00:39:23,054 --> 00:39:24,881
He and Matt have been running around...

368
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:28,222
with a couple of girls
at the Washington Arms Hotel.

369
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:32,677
Now, the worst part of it all
is that he's been lying to his mother.

370
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,808
He's leaving her think
that he's made an honest success.

371
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,775
Why, sure it's only a question of time
when he's going to be caught.

372
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:42,649
And then he'll be
after breaking her poor heart.

373
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:44,400
But what's he doing?

374
00:39:44,575 --> 00:39:46,484
Beer. Bootleg.

375
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:50,611
He's one of Paddy Ryan's gang.
But that's not all.

376
00:39:51,832 --> 00:39:54,038
Sure, they stop at nothing.

377
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:58,202
You either take their beer,
or they put you on the spot.

378
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,250
I tell you, Michael, it is a wicked business.

379
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:04,167
Why, only last week...

380
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:12,641
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

381
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:21,899
That's nice of you, Tommy...

382
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,607
but I don't think
Mike will be able to drink any.

383
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:27,069
It's the best beer in town.
It'll do him good.

384
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:32,660
Dinner's all ready, Michael.

385
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,281
- Shall I help you in?
- No, Mother. I can make it.

386
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:40,167
I'll be getting along. I'll see you all later.

387
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:43,078
Bye-bye.

388
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,849
How's the meat, Mikey?

389
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:07,896
Fine, Ma.

390
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,113
I wish you'd eat more.
Try some of this cabbage.

391
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,864
I've had plenty, Ma.

392
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:28,254
Say, we haven't drunk to your health yet.

393
00:41:28,342 --> 00:41:30,216
This is a swell celebration.

394
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,509
There you are, Mike.

395
00:41:41,688 --> 00:41:45,223
- That's enough for you, Ma.
- Put a head on that, will you?

396
00:41:48,611 --> 00:41:49,856
Miss Powers.

397
00:41:57,203 --> 00:41:59,077
Well, here's to you, Mike.

398
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:12,550
Why don't you drink, Mike?

399
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:16,879
Come on, it's only beer.

400
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,718
I don't want any, Matt.

401
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:24,181
What's eating you?

402
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:28,974
I'm not interfering with your drinking.
if you want to drink it, go on.

403
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:31,351
if I don't want to, I don't have to.

404
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:41,695
So beer ain't good enough for you?

405
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:45,780
You think I'd care
if it was just beer in that keg?

406
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:48,449
I know what's in it.
I know what you've been doing...

407
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:50,621
how you got those clothes
and those new cars.

408
00:42:50,714 --> 00:42:54,379
You've been telling Ma you're in politics,
that you're on the city payroll.

409
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:56,590
Pat Burke told me everything.

410
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,959
You murderers!

411
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:01,513
There's not only beer in that keg,
there's beer and blood.

412
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,058
The blood of men!

413
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,238
You ain't changed a bit.

414
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:26,828
Besides, your hands ain't so clean.
You killed and liked it.

415
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:29,702
You didn't get them medals
for holding hands with Germans.

416
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:33,162
Please, he ain't himself.
He don't know what he's talking about.

417
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:36,089
This trip's been too much
for the poor soul.

418
00:43:36,174 --> 00:43:38,380
Lord have pity on him.

419
00:43:38,468 --> 00:43:40,046
Please, Tommy.

420
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,385
Come on, Matt. Let's get out of here
before I go screwy, too.

421
00:43:44,474 --> 00:43:47,047
Don't go away, Tommy. Don't be angry.

422
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:50,563
You can send my clothes
to the Washington Arms Hotel.

423
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:14,051
Get up, lazybones.
What are you gonna do, sleep all day?

424
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:17,551
Button up. I can sleep as long as I like.

425
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:21,506
That's a fine way to talk to me
after I cooked this lovely breakfast for you.

426
00:44:21,602 --> 00:44:23,641
With my own lily-white hands.

427
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:27,896
Lake View 8515. Right.

428
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,645
- Hello?
- Hello, is Tom there?

429
00:44:35,198 --> 00:44:39,278
I just called his apartment. They said
he stepped across the hall for breakfast.

430
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:40,531
Nails Nathan.

431
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:44,989
Just a minute. Tom, it's for you.

432
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:47,659
- Who is it?
- Nails Nathan.

433
00:45:04,643 --> 00:45:06,600
- Hello, kid.
- Hello, Tom.

434
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:09,726
- What's the matter, kid?
- Nothing.

435
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:14,270
Only the dame's beginning
to get on my nerves, that's all.

436
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:21,324
Listen, I'm getting fed up
on these rubber checks bouncing in.

437
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,909
We're laying down good beer and
getting nothing but a lot of bum paper.

438
00:45:25,288 --> 00:45:28,906
I got one this morning for $1,200
from that Pete over on Kedzie Avenue.

439
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,621
Get over there. I want that dough.

440
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:36,126
Cash or his heart.
if you can't bring in one, bring in the other.

441
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:41,884
I'll bring you both. Leave it to me, kid.

442
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:43,718
All right.

443
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:46,720
Come on in, Matt. Shake a leg.

444
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:49,554
Nails wants us to do him a favor.

445
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:51,473
In a minute.

446
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:56,067
It's all ready, Tom.

447
00:45:56,986 --> 00:46:00,152
- Ain't you got a drink in the house?
- Not before breakfast, dear.

448
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:02,490
I didn't ask you for any lip.

449
00:46:02,574 --> 00:46:05,112
- I asked you if you got a drink.
- I know, Tom...

450
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:08,664
- but I wishâ€”
- There you go with that "wishing" stuff.

451
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,416
I wish you was a wishing well...

452
00:46:14,002 --> 00:46:16,872
so that I could tie a bucket to you
and sink you.

453
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,337
Maybe you found someone you like better.

454
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,697
How goes it, babe?

455
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,468
- Going south?
- Yes.

456
00:47:08,513 --> 00:47:11,965
But I'm not accustomed
to riding with strangers.

457
00:47:15,895 --> 00:47:18,053
We're not going to be strangers.

458
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:22,349
- How far are you going?
- Pretty far. Near Jackson Park.

459
00:47:23,945 --> 00:47:26,780
- Is that out of your way?
- No.

460
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:29,939
My chauffeur's just crazy
about long drives.

461
00:47:31,243 --> 00:47:32,951
Step on it, James.

462
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:37,704
Well, do I look good to you?

463
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,621
- You sure do.
- I feel flattered.

464
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:45,421
You know,
you're not the worst I've seen, either.

465
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:54,556
- From Chicago?
- Not exactly. I came from Texas.

466
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:58,810
- Where you living?
- The Congress Hotel.

467
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:02,265
if you're a stranger here,
Tom and me will show you the town.

468
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:04,349
Stick to your driving, mug.

469
00:48:10,323 --> 00:48:12,362
Say, you can let me off here.

470
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:14,657
I'm going to meet my friends
on the corner.

471
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,756
Could I see you again later?

472
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:30,755
I'd be happy to have you
call me sometime.

473
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,801
I mean, later today.

474
00:48:33,304 --> 00:48:36,470
I'll think it over. Give me
your phone number and I'll call you.

475
00:48:36,557 --> 00:48:39,558
All right, babe. Yards 3771.

476
00:48:41,896 --> 00:48:45,099
I'll remember it.
And in the meantime, thanks.

477
00:48:47,484 --> 00:48:50,650
- My name is Gwen. Gwen Allen.
- And mine's Tom Powers.

478
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:54,153
- Yeah, and mine is Matt.
- He ain't got a name, just a number.

479
00:49:09,005 --> 00:49:11,793
She's a honey. I could go for her myself.

480
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,625
What do you mean,
you could go for her yourself?

481
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,292
You could go for
an 80-year-old chick with rheumatism.

482
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:19,096
When are you going to see her?

483
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:23,261
- She's going to call me.
- Find out if she's got a friend.

484
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:27,687
What do you want with her friend?
You got Mamie, ain't you?

485
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:31,149
Ain't you going to kiss your little baby?

486
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:35,437
- You got Kitty, ain't you?
- I ain't going to have her much longer.

487
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:38,650
I'm fed up. You can tell her so for me.

488
00:49:39,201 --> 00:49:40,861
Step on the gas, will you?

489
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:48,702
Max, George, quick.

490
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:54,246
Delighted to see you, Mr. Nathan.

491
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,464
- How are you, Joe?
- Fine, thank you.

492
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:58,093
Where would you like to sit?

493
00:49:58,177 --> 00:50:00,218
Where do I always sit?
Right at the ringside.

494
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:02,463
- May be full up there.
- We can fix that, sir.

495
00:50:02,557 --> 00:50:05,926
Max, George, fix a table immediately
at the railing for Mr. Nathan.

496
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:09,601
Great. The best is none too good tonight.
This is a wedding celebration.

497
00:50:09,689 --> 00:50:11,100
- Really?
- Yep.

498
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,812
Matt's decided
to take something lawful: a wife.

499
00:50:14,402 --> 00:50:17,071
- That's something to celebrate about.
- I should say so.

500
00:50:17,155 --> 00:50:20,939
- Meet Mr. and Mrs. Doyle.
- We're honored, I assure you.

501
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:25,404
- Let's dance while they're fixing the tables.
- This way, please.

502
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:32,417
- Hiya, Nails.
- Hello, Tom.

503
00:50:32,503 --> 00:50:35,255
- How are you, Mr. Nathan?
- Harry, making money?

504
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:38,792
- Right this way, please.
- Hello, Jim. How are you?

505
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:01,987
- Are you as happy as I am, Matt?
- Sure, honey.

506
00:51:04,242 --> 00:51:07,408
You fellows don't know what it means
to a girl, getting married.

507
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,288
You knew all the time
I was going to marry you, didn't you?

508
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:13,411
Of course I did.

509
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:16,581
I was just thinking of Tom and Kitty.

510
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:23,044
Well, they're different.
I guess Tom ain't the marrying kind.

511
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:25,011
No, I guess not.

512
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,289
Are you sure that was old Putty Nose?

513
00:51:58,377 --> 00:52:01,498
- I ought to know him when I see him.
- Sure you know him.

514
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,879
I suppose you'd like
to put in with him again.

515
00:52:03,966 --> 00:52:06,920
That's the Fagin that
put something over on you, ain't it?

516
00:52:07,804 --> 00:52:10,294
I had to laugh when I heard about that.

517
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:14,508
That guy's going to get you again.
He thinks you're soft.

518
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:18,846
- He ain't going to get me.
- We don't want any part of him.

519
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:23,854
I haven't got a thing to say, boys.
But they got the lndian sign on you, Tom.

520
00:52:23,944 --> 00:52:27,029
- He thinks you're a cinch.
- In a pig's eye.

521
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,487
That McGonagall ain't got a chance.

522
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:44,838
Take care of the women, Nails.

523
00:52:44,923 --> 00:52:48,042
You're not going out
in the cold, dark night, are you?

524
00:52:48,134 --> 00:52:51,088
Nails will see that you get home.
We got a little job to do.

525
00:52:51,178 --> 00:52:52,672
Come on, Matt.

526
00:52:53,806 --> 00:52:55,929
You're not gonna leave me tonight, Matt?

527
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:03,936
There's something we forgot to do, honey.
I'll be home later.

528
00:53:05,943 --> 00:53:07,223
Come on.

529
00:53:11,406 --> 00:53:12,782
Where's he going?

530
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:15,820
They're just walking around the block
to cool themselves off.

531
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:18,283
What are you worrying about? Sit down.

532
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:25,044
Have it ready at 8:00. Fill it with gas.

533
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:27,587
I'm going on a long trip.

534
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:43,514
Well, if it ain't Tom Powers and Matt, too.
How are you, boys?

535
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,730
- Been out of town?
- Yeah, I was down home, visiting.

536
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:52,017
- Got a little drink for us, Putty?
- Sure, Tom.

537
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:54,777
But I can't let you in just now.

538
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:59,242
You see, I've got a Jane inside.
I'll bring it right out to you.

539
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,328
Wait a minute, Putty Nose.

540
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:05,251
- We got words for you.
- What's up, Tom?

541
00:54:06,168 --> 00:54:09,501
We got a little business to settle,
Jane or no Jane.

542
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:13,538
You ain't sore, are you, Tom?
I've always been your friend.

543
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:18,379
Sure. You taught us how to cheat,
steal, and kill. Then you lammed out on us.

544
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:21,389
if it hadn't been for you,
we might have been on the level.

545
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:24,559
Sure. We might have been
ding-dings on a streetcar.

546
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,432
Come on.

547
00:54:35,613 --> 00:54:39,029
A Jane, huh?
There ain't no one here but him.

548
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:41,237
I thought so.

549
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,576
Why, you dirty, double-crossing...

550
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,619
What are you squawking about?
You got plenty more coming.

551
00:54:58,678 --> 00:55:00,420
What are you gonna do?

552
00:55:01,054 --> 00:55:02,882
I don't want to die.

553
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,011
So you don't want to die?

554
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,734
Tommy, don't you remember
you and Matt...

555
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:19,733
how you used to be just kids
and how we were friends?

556
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:25,363
You won't let him, Matt.
I'll do anything for you from now on.

557
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,744
Ain't you got a heart, Matty boy?

558
00:55:27,831 --> 00:55:30,452
Don't you remember
how I used to play to you?

559
00:55:30,917 --> 00:55:35,045
And didn't I always stick up for you?
I ain't got this coming.

560
00:55:36,714 --> 00:55:39,040
Please, Matt, don't let him.

561
00:55:39,676 --> 00:55:41,549
I ain't a bad fellow, really.

562
00:55:41,636 --> 00:55:44,886
Tommy, don't. Ain't you got a heart?

563
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:47,881
Tell me you won't let him, Matt, will you?

564
00:55:47,975 --> 00:55:52,304
You remember that song I used to sing?
That song I taught you?

565
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:53,897
You remember, Tommy.

566
00:55:53,981 --> 00:55:58,228
Back in the club,
how you kids used to laugh at that song.

567
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,303
Guess I'll call up Gwen.

568
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:32,640
She ought to be home by now.

569
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:55,618
Let me make you a cup of tea.

570
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,949
I got to be getting back on the job
in a minute.

571
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:02,586
My, but it's good to see you again.
I was beginning to think I'd lost you.

572
00:57:03,716 --> 00:57:05,589
You can't lose me that easy.

573
00:57:08,594 --> 00:57:09,970
Poor Michael.

574
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:13,305
I'm afraid he's working himself
into an early grave.

575
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:17,424
Days on the cars, school at night,
and studying in between.

576
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:20,226
Listen, Ma,
I came over to give you something.

577
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:22,058
Here, take this.

578
00:57:22,817 --> 00:57:25,224
When you need more, just say so.
I'm making plenty.

579
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,478
You're a good boy, Tommy, but I can't.

580
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:29,896
- Take it.
- Mike wouldn't like it.

581
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:32,826
- Mike ain't got nothing to say about it.
- No?

582
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:39,447
Listen to me.
I've got something important to say.

583
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:41,830
Keep it to yourself.
Nobody wants your two cents.

584
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:45,205
I don't want you two boys fighting.
It ain't right for two brothers.

585
00:57:45,297 --> 00:57:48,084
There won't be fighting.
Only, I don't need his preaching.

586
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:51,294
- What is this, Ma?
- Tommy gave it to me to buy some things.

587
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:54,091
- Ain't that nice of him?
- It's more than you can do.

588
00:57:54,181 --> 00:57:56,257
We don't want your money.
I'll look after Ma.

589
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,971
- On two bits a week?
- Ma don't drink champagne.

590
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:01,812
How do you know?
I used to dance when I was a girl.

591
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:05,645
I won't argue with you, and
I can't tell you all I'd like to in front of Ma.

592
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:08,569
But get an earful of this:
You ain't welcome in this house.

593
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:10,610
That's blood money. We want no part of it.

594
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:15,442
- Hiding behind Ma's skirts, like always.
- Better than hiding behind a machine gun.

595
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,072
You're too smart.

596
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,661
- I'm going, Ma.
- And don't forget your change.

597
00:58:24,961 --> 00:58:27,498
- Money don't mean nothing to me.
- No, I guess not.

598
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,755
But with no heart or brains,
it's all you've got. You'll need it.

599
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,000
Why you sneaking, stooling...

600
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:48,892
Michael, why did you hit him?

601
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,439
I may leave town next week.

602
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:57,816
You don't care, do you?

603
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:08,206
When I first met you,
I sort of figured you was on the make.

604
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:11,248
Not much. You know what I mean.

605
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,918
And besides that...

606
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:17,167
I figured you was sort of different, too.

607
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:21,130
That is, different from the kind of girls
I was used to.

608
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,434
I don't go in for these long-winded things,
but with me, it was always yes or no.

609
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,597
And I could never figure you out.

610
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:33,859
- Now can you?
- No.

611
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:38,068
But I guess I ain't your kind.

612
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:41,658
- I think I better call it quits.
- Don't be like that, Tommy...

613
00:59:42,703 --> 00:59:45,620
because I "go for you," as you say.

614
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:49,323
Maybe too much.

615
00:59:51,503 --> 00:59:55,038
You know, all my friends...

616
00:59:56,382 --> 00:59:59,917
think that things are different between us
than they are.

617
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:03,886
They figure they know me pretty well...

618
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:06,298
and don't think I'd go
for a merry-go-round.

619
01:00:06,392 --> 01:00:09,511
Do you think
I'm giving you a merry-go-round?

620
01:00:11,689 --> 01:00:15,022
- No, lâ€”
- Then do you want things to be different...

621
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:17,730
to please your boyfriends?

622
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:21,066
No, but how long can a guy hold out?

623
01:00:21,991 --> 01:00:23,271
I'm gonna go screwy.

624
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:26,202
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna blow.

625
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:29,780
You're a spoiled boy, Tommy.

626
01:00:30,374 --> 01:00:33,743
You want things,
and you're not content until you get them.

627
01:00:34,586 --> 01:00:38,999
Or maybe I'm spoiled, too.
Maybe I feel that way, too.

628
01:00:40,217 --> 01:00:44,001
But you're not running away from me.
Come here.

629
01:00:55,649 --> 01:01:00,191
Now you stay put,
if you know what that means.

630
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,108
My bashful boy.

631
01:01:10,955 --> 01:01:13,113
You are different, Tommy.

632
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,536
Very different.

633
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:21,252
And I've discovered
it isn't only a difference in manner...

634
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:23,000
and outward appearances.

635
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,006
It's a difference in basic character.

636
01:01:27,178 --> 01:01:28,887
The men I know...

637
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:31,845
and I've known dozens of them...

638
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:34,393
they're so nice...

639
01:01:35,312 --> 01:01:37,387
so polished, so considerate.

640
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:42,942
Most women like that type.
I guess they're afraid of the other kind.

641
01:01:44,362 --> 01:01:46,022
I thought I was, too.

642
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,817
But you're so strong.

643
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:51,400
You don't give, you take.

644
01:01:52,244 --> 01:01:54,486
Tommy, I could love you to death.

645
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:04,750
Oh, nuts.

646
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,181
ls Tom here?

647
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:23,815
Nails is dead.

648
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:31,991
- Who killed him?
- Nobody. His horse.

649
01:02:33,035 --> 01:02:36,154
He was thrown off in the park,
kicked in the head.

650
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:28,286
- You got that horse that killed Nails?
- You mean Rajah?

651
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,674
He bad animal. Terrible.

652
01:03:31,758 --> 01:03:33,134
Yeah, what's he worth?

653
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:36,221
Spirited horse.
I told Mr. Nathan not to ride him.

654
01:03:36,304 --> 01:03:37,763
What's he worth?

655
01:03:39,307 --> 01:03:42,094
He could be bought for $1,000.
You see, it'sâ€”

656
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,473
- Never mind. Here.
- Where's he at?

657
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:48,560
Stall Number 3.

658
01:03:54,029 --> 01:03:55,524
Stay where you are.

659
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:50,703
Right now, we ain't got a chance.

660
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,126
Since Nails has gone, his mob has
scattered. They're ten-to-one against us.

661
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:56,715
Look at this dump.

662
01:04:57,174 --> 01:05:00,839
Four pineapples tossed at us in two days,
and the brewery set fire.

663
01:05:00,928 --> 01:05:03,051
I'm telling you, they got us on the run.

664
01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:06,839
- Not me. I ain't running. I ain't yellow.
- Who said you was?

665
01:05:07,142 --> 01:05:09,099
I ain't talking about that.

666
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:12,270
I'm gonna need you.

667
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:17,266
And you won't be no good to me
when you're in the cemetery.

668
01:05:17,986 --> 01:05:21,769
I got to have a couple of days
to get the boys lined up again.

669
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:23,146
While I'm doing that...

670
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:26,158
you'll be where nobody knows
where to find you except me.

671
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:33,207
Come on, give me your guns
and your money. All of it.

672
01:05:34,377 --> 01:05:37,911
- What are you trying to pull, Paddy?
- I'm gonna keep you off the streets.

673
01:05:38,005 --> 01:05:41,339
Even you wouldn't be sap enough
to go for a stroll without your gat.

674
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:43,419
Come on, shower down.

675
01:05:58,442 --> 01:05:59,722
All of it.

676
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:07,904
You got a phone here, Jane?
I'm gonna call Gwen.

677
01:06:07,993 --> 01:06:10,484
No, you keep away from that phone.

678
01:06:10,828 --> 01:06:14,446
I'll call from outside and tell her
I sent you out of town for a few days.

679
01:06:14,582 --> 01:06:17,251
- And ring up Mamie, will you?
- Leave it to me.

680
01:06:18,378 --> 01:06:20,286
This won't be for long, boys.

681
01:06:21,298 --> 01:06:24,501
I'll have the mob lined up again
in a couple of days.

682
01:06:25,594 --> 01:06:27,336
You'll see that they're comfortable?

683
01:06:27,428 --> 01:06:30,263
- You leave that to me, Paddy.
- Okay.

684
01:06:32,892 --> 01:06:36,592
Gather round, boys.
We're going to be a happy, little family.

685
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:41,356
I hope you got plenty of this medicine.

686
01:07:19,729 --> 01:07:23,063
Yards 6321.

687
01:07:26,902 --> 01:07:28,065
Hello.

688
01:07:29,571 --> 01:07:30,983
ls Schemer there?

689
01:07:37,872 --> 01:07:40,243
Let me make you another drink, Tommy.

690
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:45,038
You mean to say
you got any of that stuff left?

691
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:46,956
You haven't drank so much.

692
01:07:50,425 --> 01:07:53,343
I can drink it as long as you can pour it.

693
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:26,251
Only a coal truck.

694
01:08:28,963 --> 01:08:30,872
Had me going for a minute.

695
01:08:30,965 --> 01:08:34,415
- Come on, get in the game, will you, Tom?
- No.

696
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:37,843
I'm gonna hit the hay.

697
01:09:04,497 --> 01:09:07,333
I thought you'd like a little nightcap.

698
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:13,963
You don't need to feel ashamed
in front of me.

699
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:16,883
Here, let me help you.

700
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:23,928
- I don't need any help.
- Be a good boy and sit down.

701
01:09:28,729 --> 01:09:30,935
I'll take your shoes off, too.

702
01:09:35,193 --> 01:09:37,601
I want to do things for you, Tommy.

703
01:09:44,244 --> 01:09:46,734
You don't think I'm old, do you?

704
01:09:48,707 --> 01:09:52,372
- No.
- You like me, don't you?

705
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:54,874
Sure.

706
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:05,216
What's the idea?

707
01:10:06,307 --> 01:10:09,722
Just a goodnight kiss for a fine boy.

708
01:10:13,272 --> 01:10:14,683
In your hat.

709
01:10:30,622 --> 01:10:33,789
Get away from me.
You're Paddy Ryan's girl.

710
01:10:37,212 --> 01:10:41,079
- Breakfast is all ready, Tommy.
- I ain't hungry.

711
01:10:42,467 --> 01:10:45,503
Give me some coffee, will you?
And make it black.

712
01:10:47,889 --> 01:10:50,296
You aren't sorry, are you?

713
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:54,634
- Sorry for what?
- For last night.

714
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,896
What do you mean, for getting drunk?

715
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:02,523
Aren't you the little playactor?

716
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:12,405
Wait a minute.

717
01:11:14,499 --> 01:11:16,241
Do you mean thatâ€”

718
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,878
Why, you...

719
01:11:25,092 --> 01:11:26,799
- Tom, where you going?
- Home.

720
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:28,843
- But Paddyâ€”
- I don't care what Paddy said!

721
01:11:28,928 --> 01:11:30,838
I'm getting out of this dump.

722
01:11:41,148 --> 01:11:43,023
Hey, Tom, wait a minute.

723
01:11:44,236 --> 01:11:47,686
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just got burned up, that's all.

724
01:11:48,031 --> 01:11:50,319
What do you wanna run out on me for?

725
01:11:51,283 --> 01:11:52,991
We're together, ain't we?

726
01:11:55,705 --> 01:11:56,950
Sure.

727
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:41,904
Yes, sir?

728
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:45,325
I was looking at some of the pistols
in the window.

729
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,162
- Shall I show you some?
- Yeah.

730
01:12:47,254 --> 01:12:51,086
- I kind of like that big one.
- That one? All right.

731
01:12:57,306 --> 01:13:01,006
- What do you call that?
- That's a.38 caliber. It's a fineâ€”

732
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:02,430
You got any more like it?

733
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,808
- I've got some smaller ones.
- No, same size.

734
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,428
Sure.

735
01:13:13,572 --> 01:13:16,739
- How do you load that?
- First you break it.

736
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:19,948
Then you stick the cartridges in the holes.

737
01:13:20,037 --> 01:13:21,661
- Could I see?
- Sure.

738
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,373
- That's right.
- Like that?

739
01:13:31,464 --> 01:13:34,169
- It'll hold six.
- This will be enough.

740
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,137
Stick them up.

741
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:12,368
Okay, Schemer, it's all set.

742
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:01,191
I ain't so tough.

743
01:16:13,872 --> 01:16:16,576
- Well, Doc, what do you think?
- Can't say.

744
01:16:16,874 --> 01:16:18,748
We'll hope for the best.

745
01:16:23,255 --> 01:16:26,339
Doctor, this is Tom's mother, brother,
and Miss Doyle.

746
01:16:26,425 --> 01:16:28,584
You can go in for a few moments,
Mrs. Powers.

747
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:29,958
Thank you, sir.

748
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:45,985
Tommy boy.

749
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,315
Do you know me?

750
01:16:58,582 --> 01:16:59,862
Sure, Ma.

751
01:17:05,589 --> 01:17:07,047
Mike's here.

752
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,208
He's come to see you.

753
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:16,134
- Hello, Mike.
- How are you, Tom, old scuff?

754
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:23,228
I've been wanting to see you.

755
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,060
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me, Tom.

756
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:31,147
There's something
I wanted to say to you, Mike.

757
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:40,199
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

758
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,167
I'm just sorry.

759
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,494
You know.

760
01:17:52,384 --> 01:17:55,170
You and Mike
are going to be friends again?

761
01:17:56,804 --> 01:17:57,967
Sure.

762
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,261
Friends.

763
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:06,263
Boys, I'm so happy.

764
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,226
So happy.

765
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:19,076
Ma, you must like Mike
a lot better than me.

766
01:18:19,785 --> 01:18:23,403
No, Tommy boy. You're my baby.

767
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,662
Sure.

768
01:18:32,047 --> 01:18:33,292
I'm your baby.

769
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:38,838
You're coming home, ain't you, Tommy?

770
01:18:39,554 --> 01:18:40,929
To stay?

771
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,255
Sure.

772
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:46,686
Coming home.

773
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:53,063
I mean, if I can ever get out of here.

774
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:55,523
You're gonna get out of here, all right.

775
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:59,691
Why, of course you are.
You're going to get well and strong.

776
01:19:00,575 --> 01:19:02,366
Both my boys back.

777
01:19:02,994 --> 01:19:05,200
All of us together again.

778
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:10,165
I'm almost glad this happened.

779
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:37,651
And he really looked better today,
did he, Michael?

780
01:19:37,902 --> 01:19:40,441
Sure, Ma, a lot better. He was sitting up.

781
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:42,523
I told him you'd be in
to see him tomorrow.

782
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:46,565
- And he'll be coming home soon, won't he?
- Sure, Ma.

783
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:04,797
Paddy, come in.

784
01:20:11,352 --> 01:20:14,103
What's wrong? ls Tomâ€”

785
01:20:14,313 --> 01:20:17,018
They kidnapped him
from the hospital this afternoon.

786
01:20:17,108 --> 01:20:18,816
What? Who did?

787
01:20:19,693 --> 01:20:21,935
Must have been the Burns mob.

788
01:20:23,363 --> 01:20:27,860
First they give it to him in the back,
then they take him when he's helpless.

789
01:20:28,409 --> 01:20:30,201
Who knows
what they're doing to him now.

790
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:33,204
- They ain't gonna get away with this.
- I'm doing all I can.

791
01:20:33,665 --> 01:20:35,953
My boys are out in the street now.

792
01:20:36,752 --> 01:20:39,586
I'll bring Tom back,
if it's the last thing I do.

793
01:20:39,671 --> 01:20:41,912
- I'm gonnaâ€”
- You're gonna...

794
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:46,124
stay here at that phone
and take messages.

795
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:50,597
I told my boys to call you up
if they find anything.

796
01:20:50,682 --> 01:20:52,805
- I'd like to smashâ€”
- Listen...

797
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:59,686
I sent word to Burns that
if he'd bring Tom back here tonight...

798
01:21:01,066 --> 01:21:02,810
I'd quit the racket.

799
01:21:03,444 --> 01:21:05,151
He could have it all.

800
01:21:06,614 --> 01:21:09,283
I'd leave town and I won't come back.

801
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:12,493
- You think they'll do it?
- It's a sweet offer.

802
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:17,908
You stay here.

803
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,329
if you hear anything
from any one of my boys...

804
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:23,252
call me at my place.

805
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,916
I got to get back on the job.

806
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:50,235
Don't you like your dinner?

807
01:21:50,782 --> 01:21:53,070
Why, I just ain't hungry, Ma.

808
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,289
I'll get it, Ma.

809
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,547
This is Mike.

810
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:11,457
When? You are?

811
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,263
Fine. Ma, they're bringing Tom home.

812
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,182
- They are? When?
- Right now. He's on his way.

813
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:20,059
- Is he all right?
- He must be.

814
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:22,930
- They wouldn't be bringing him home.
- It's wonderful.

815
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:26,978
I'll get his room ready.
I knew my baby would come home.

816
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,778
- Who called?
- One of Paddy's boys. Didn't say who.

817
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:34,196
- Molly dear?
- Yes, Mother?

818
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,855
Bring up some clean sheets
out of the linen closet.

819
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:38,908
- Hurry, dear.
- All right.
