1
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:49,898
The channel's here on the chart.
So are the marking lights.

2
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:52,246
Then what's wrong with them?

3
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:55,680
Those lights don't seem to be
in just the right place.

4
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:57,996
They're both a bit out of position,
according to this.

5
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,828
Two light buoys mean a safe channel
between the world over.

6
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,432
"Safe between the world over"
doesn't go in these waters.

7
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,070
Look here. You'll see the water
shoals on the island side,

8
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:11,994
while the deep soundings
run to the mainland.

9
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:13,835
Have any of you seen
the captain today?

10
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,875
- No. He wasn't down for dinner.
- No, and he wasn't down for lunch.

11
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:22,023
He hasn't left the bridge since you
decided to come through the channel.

12
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:24,076
What are you driving at?

13
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:27,496
Ever since you gave him those orders
yesterday to cut through these waters,

14
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:29,458
he's had the jitters.

15
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:34,165
There's something wrong. I...
Hey, I'm getting nervous myself.

16
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:36,406
Doc, what do you recommend for nerves?

17
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:38,735
- Give him a shot of scotch.
- Give the whole bottle.

18
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:41,925
- No! I've got nerves too.
- Here you are, Doc.

19
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:46,117
Just what you need.

20
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:50,070
- Well, maybe you're right.
- And how, boy.

21
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,189
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening, sir.

22
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,953
- May I speak with you?
- Why, certainly. Go ahead.

23
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,141
We're heading straight for the channel
between Branca Island and the mainland.

24
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:03,309
Good.

25
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:06,652
But the lights are just a bit
off, according to the chart.

26
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:09,738
The charts are never up to date in this
part of the Pacific. You know that.

27
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:11,843
I know, sir, but...

28
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:14,244
Doesn't Branca Island
mean anything to you?

29
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:17,793
- Well, not a lot.
- Perhaps if I spoke with Mr Rainsford.

30
00:03:17,793 --> 00:03:19,705
Bob's not a sailor.
He's a hunter.

31
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,006
He's made many of these trips.
He's young, but he has judgment.

32
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,307
I'll call him.

33
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:28,427
- Oh, Bob. Bob!
- What is it?

34
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,943
- Come up here, will you?
- Just a minute.

35
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,119
What's bothering you, Captain?

36
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:38,136
There are no more coral-reefed,
shark-infested waters
in the whole world than these.

37
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:40,598
Boy! Just take a look at these.

38
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:44,022
You didn't turn out so hot as a hunter,
Doc, but oh, what a photographer.

39
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:46,574
If we'd had you to take pictures
on the Sumatran trip,

40
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:48,082
they might have believed my book.

41
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:52,006
If you'd had me on the Sumatran trip,
you'd have never had me on this one.

42
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:57,100
Say, here's a swell one of
the ship, Skipper. What's the matter?

43
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,197
These old sea dogs tell yarns
to kid each other...

44
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,018
and end up
believing it all themselves.

45
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,164
I think that Mr Rainsford
should know...

46
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:05,751
that the channel lights aren't just
in the position given on the charts.

47
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:08,864
Oh. Well, what do you think, fellows?

48
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:11,628
I think we should turn back
and take the outside course.

49
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,650
We'll go ahead.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,540
Very well, sir.
It's your ship.

51
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:26,852
"It was the schooner 'Hesperus,'
and she sailed the wintry sea."

52
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:29,402
Now, wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk this over.

53
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:32,497
- There's no use taking any chances.
- Chances? That's fine talk...

54
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:35,012
coming from a fella who just got through
slapping tigers in the face.

55
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:37,354
Get an eyeful of this.

56
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:39,855
And he talks about taking chances.

57
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:43,246
Here's the doc charging the enemy
with an unloaded camera.

58
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,236
Get the expression
on Doc's face, Bill.

59
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:46,992
He looks more frightened
than the tiger.

60
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:50,885
- He is.
- What'd you have on your mind, Doc?

61
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,649
I'll tell you
what I had on my mind.

62
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,779
I was thinking of the inconsistency
of civilisation.

63
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:01,030
The beast of the jungle killing just
for his existence is called savage.

64
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,762
The man, killing just for sport,
is called civilised.

65
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,931
- Hear! Hear!
- It's a bit contradictory, isn't it?

66
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:09,468
Now, just a minute.
What makes you think it isn't...

67
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,571
just as much sport for the
animal as it is for the man?

68
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,684
Take that fellow right there,
for instance.

69
00:05:14,764 --> 00:05:17,157
There never was a time
when he couldn't have gotten away.

70
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,205
He didn't want to.
He got interested in hunting me.

71
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,205
He didn't hate me
for stalking him,

72
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:25,097
any more than I hated him
for trying to charge me.

73
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,395
As a matter of fact,
we admired each other.

74
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,806
Perhaps, but would you change places
with the tiger?

75
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:36,236
- Well, not now.
- Mm-mm!

76
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,299
Here comes
that bad-luck lady again.

77
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:40,351
Third time tonight.

78
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,932
- Here. Let me shuffle them.
- Wait a minute. Don't evade the issue.

79
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,482
- Yeah, speak up.
- I asked you a question.

80
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:49,533
- You did? I forgot.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

81
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:52,480
I asked you if there'd be
as much sport in the game...

82
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,578
if you were the tiger
instead of the hunter.

83
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:55,944
- Come on.
- What's your answer now, Bob?

84
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,975
That's something
I'll never have to decide.

85
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:00,340
Listen here, you fellows.

86
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:04,003
This world's divided into two kinds
of people - the hunter and the hunted.

87
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,123
Luckily, I'm a hunter.
Nothing can ever change that.

88
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:08,795
Hang on!

89
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:22,684
Hello! Hello, down there!
Hello, Engine Room!

90
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:26,036
- The panel is flooded!
- If the water hits those hot boilers...

91
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,766
Help!

92
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,930
Help!

93
00:07:14,897 --> 00:07:16,766
You trying to drown me?

94
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,866
Where are the others?

95
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:26,222
See anybody?

96
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,963
Nobody left but us two
and that fellow.

97
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:38,658
Doc! Help!

98
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:40,710
- Look!
- Shark!

99
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,269
Ohh! It got me!

100
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,554
Hello!
Is anybody here?

101
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,494
Anybody around, I say.

102
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:05,341
Oh, hello.
Is this your house?

103
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,826
I'm not trying to break in,
but I've been in a wreck.

104
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,767
Our yacht just sunk
with all hands.

105
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,285
I got ashore and found
your place here by accident.

106
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:26,671
I'm not trying to intrude,
but I'm in sort of a jam.

107
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:31,115
Don't you understand
any English?

108
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:33,579
Ivan does not speak any language.

109
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,304
He has the misfortune
to be dumb.

110
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,481
Oh, hello.
Are you the owner here?

111
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:43,664
Yes.
Welcome to my poor fortress.

112
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:46,040
- Fortress?
- It once was.

113
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,848
Built by the Portuguese,
centuries ago.

114
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:53,093
I have had the ruins restored
to make my home here.

115
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:55,183
I am Count Zaroff.

116
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,212
My name's Robert Rainsford.
Glad to meet you.

117
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:02,065
Very glad.

118
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,158
Ivan is a Cossack.

119
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:07,967
I am afraid, like all my fellow
countrymen, he is a bit of a savage.

120
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:10,018
Smile, Ivan.

121
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,027
I was trying to make him understand
there'd been a shipwreck in the channel.

122
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:28,144
But how appalling!

123
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:31,157
And you mean to say
that you are the only survivor?

124
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,114
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

125
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,104
You're certain?

126
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,114
I'd have never left the spot
if I hadn't been.

127
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:44,483
The swellest crowd on Earth,
my best friends.

128
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:48,443
- It's incredible.
- Such things are always incredible.

129
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,415
Death is for others,
not for ourselves.

130
00:12:51,776 --> 00:12:54,922
That is how most
of my other guests have felt.

131
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:58,061
Your other guests?
You mean this has happened before?

132
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:03,337
My fellow, we have several survivors
from the last wreck still in the house.

133
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,871
It would seem that this island
were cursed.

134
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,326
That's just what the captain said.

135
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,443
Only he thought
it was uninhabited.

136
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:15,081
We Cossacks find our inspiration
in solitude.

137
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:19,158
- Well, it's a break for me, anyway.
- My house is yours, sir.

138
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:23,057
Oh, by the way. You'll want to change
those wet rags immediately.

139
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,550
Yes. They look
about the way I feel.

140
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,255
Yes.

141
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,583
I have some loose hunting clothes,
which I keep for my guests,

142
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,364
that you can possibly
get into.

143
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:37,082
Ivan will show you
to your room.

144
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,098
Thank you.

145
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,292
You'll find a stiff drink there also.

146
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:44,901
Thanks a lot.

147
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,572
All pleasure is mine.

148
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:19,228
Come in.

149
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,241
- Ready, Rainsford?
- All set.

150
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,592
I'm afraid
we have finished dinner.

151
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:31,677
But I have ordered
something for you.

152
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,204
Thanks. I don't feel like eating.

153
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:36,650
Oh dear, dear. Well, perhaps later.

154
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:39,865
Now, then,
what do you say to coffee...

155
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,365
and most charming company?

156
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:50,137
It is hard to forget
your comrades' fate, I know,

157
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:54,218
but our feminine guest
is easily perturbed.

158
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:57,422
If I could beg you to put
a good face upon the matter.

159
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,805
Assume a cheerfulness
you may not feel.

160
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,256
- Why, sure. Of course.
- Thank you.

161
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,561
Miss Trowbridge, may I present
Mr Robert Rainsford.

162
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,109
- Miss Eve Trowbridge.
- How do you do?

163
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:18,887
- How do you do?
- And her brother, Mr Martin Trowbridge.

164
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:21,296
How are you, old chap?
Pretty well shaken up, I guess, huh?

165
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,983
- Coming out of it now, thanks.
- We know how it feels, don't we, Eve?

166
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,066
Indeed we do.

167
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,864
Perhaps Mr Rainsford would like
some hot coffee.

168
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:32,402
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr Rainsford, please sit here.

169
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:33,220
Well, thank you.

170
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,333
[translated] Give us
2 coffees with vodka.

171
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,298
Vodka, that's the stuff!

172
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:40,247
One shot'll dry you out quicker
than all the coffee in Java.

173
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,020
Have to toss it off, though.
Like this.

174
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,457
Now, Martin, you don't have
to drink it all tonight, do you?

175
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:49,027
Don't be ridiculous, sis.
We are victims of circumstance.

176
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:51,172
Same as Mr Rainsford.

177
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,738
And if anyone has a right to his liquor,
it's a victim of circumstance.

178
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,477
- Isn't that so, Count?
- Of course, yes.

179
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,538
- You were in a shipwreck

180
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,766
too, I understand? - Yes.

181
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:01,275
Our lifeboat was the
only one saved;

182
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:03,326
my brother and I
and two sailors.

183
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:06,956
The count found us on the beach with
nothing but the clothes on our backs.

184
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:09,317
Those channel lights
must have been shifted.

185
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:12,082
- I wonder it hasn't been reported.
- Well, we'll report them...

186
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:14,291
just as soon as we
get back to the mainland.

187
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:17,012
You see, the count
has only one launch...

188
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:19,980
and that's under repair.

189
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,932
Russians are not
the best mechanics.

190
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:29,532
I'm afraid we'll have to be patient
a few days longer.

191
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:33,543
It's all right with me. I feel as if I
were living on borrowed time right now.

192
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:36,522
Speaking of that,
perhaps now you'll tell us...

193
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:37,914
a little bit about who you are.

194
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:41,917
Just sketchily, you know,
born, married, why I left my last job.

195
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:43,769
No, no, no, no.
One moment, please.

196
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,655
Mr Rainsford need never explain
who he is in my house.

197
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,500
No?

198
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:51,009
No. We entertain a
celebrity, Miss Trowbridge.

199
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,882
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

200
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:58,879
I know. Flagpole sitter.

201
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,675
- I know. He wrote some books.
- No, he lived some books.

202
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:05,839
If I am not mistaken,
this is Mr Robert Rainsford,

203
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:08,062
who hunts big game
so adventurously.

204
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,650
Yeah? Here's to you.

205
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:12,797
<i>- I've lugged a gun around a little.
- "I've lugged a gun around a little."</i>

206
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,608
No, I have read your books.
I read all books on hunting.

207
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:19,006
- A papiroso?
- Thank you.

208
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,875
Only in yours have I found
a sane point of view.

209
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,202
- What do you mean, "sane"?
- Cigarette?

210
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:30,032
- Hmm? Yeah. Thanks.
- You do not excuse what needs no excuse.

211
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:31,738
Let me see.
How did you put it?

212
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:34,857
"Hunting is as much
a game as stud poker,

213
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:36,589
only the limits are higher."

214
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:40,088
You have put our case perfectly.

215
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:41,689
Oh, then you're a hunter yourself?

216
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:45,884
We are kindred spirits.
It is my one passion.

217
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,108
He sleeps all day
and hunts all night.

218
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,890
And what's more, Rainsford,
he'll have you doing the same thing.

219
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:54,252
We'll have capital sport
together, I hope.

220
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,084
Don't encourage him.

221
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,309
He's had our two sailors so busy...

222
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:00,777
chasing around the woods
after flora and fauna,

223
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,496
that we haven't
seen them for three days.

224
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:07,169
But what do you hunt here?

225
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:13,345
I'll tell you.
You will be amused, I know.

226
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,852
I have done a rare thing.

227
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,527
I have invented
a new sensation.

228
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,990
Yeah, and is he stingy with it.

229
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,807
What is this sensation, Count?

230
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:26,626
Mr Rainsford,
God made some men poets.

231
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:30,282
Some He made kings,
some beggars.

232
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,292
Me, He made a hunter.

233
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:38,272
My hand was made for the trigger,
my father told me.

234
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,384
He was a very rich man...

235
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,960
with a quarter of a million acres
in the Crimea, and an ardent sportsman.

236
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:48,677
When I was only still up high
he gave me my first gun.

237
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:52,498
- Good for him.
- My life has been one glorious hunt.

238
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:56,339
It would be impossible for me to tell
you how many animals I have killed.

239
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:59,650
- But when the revolution...
- Look out.

240
00:19:03,496 --> 00:19:04,901
Oh, I'm so sorry.

241
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,328
Count Zaroff
was so interesting,

242
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:09,381
I didn't realise the danger.

243
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:16,011
Oh, it's all right now. What were you
saying about the revolution, Count?

244
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,621
Oh, merely that I escaped
with most of my fortune.

245
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:23,794
Naturally, I continued to hunt
all over the world.

246
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:28,370
It was in Africa that the Cape buffalo
gave me this.

247
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:29,887
That must have been a close call.

248
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:33,239
Yes. It still bothers me sometimes.

249
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,121
However, in two months
I was on my way to the Amazon.

250
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:41,235
I'd heard that the jaguars there
were unusually cunning.

251
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,421
No, no, no.
No sport at all.

252
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:47,611
Well, conditions
are bad everywhere these days.

253
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:50,815
One night, as I lay
in my tent with this...

254
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,030
this head of mine,

255
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:57,206
a terrible thought crept
like a snake into my brain.

256
00:19:57,313 --> 00:20:00,474
Hunting was beginning
to bore me.

257
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:03,251
Is that such a terrible thought,
Count?

258
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:08,371
It is, my dear lady, when hunting has
been the whip for all other passions.

259
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:10,917
When I lost my love of hunting,

260
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:16,067
I lost my love of life,
of love.

261
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:21,203
Well, you seem to have
stood it pretty well.

262
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:24,963
I even tried to sink myself
to the level of the savage.

263
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:30,105
I made myself perfect in the use
of the Tartar war bow.

264
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:32,167
Tartar which?

265
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,549
Tartar war bow.

266
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:37,012
That one up there.

267
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,427
It's cute.

268
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:44,907
Even to this day I prefer
to hunt with it...

269
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,834
but, alas,
even that was too deadly.

270
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:50,203
What I needed
was not a new weapon,

271
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:53,183
but a new animal.

272
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:56,952
- A new animal?
- Exactly so.

273
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,180
You found one?

274
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,653
Yes.

275
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:06,147
Here on my island,

276
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:10,514
I hunt the most dangerous game.

277
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:15,541
"The most dangerous game"?
You mean tigers?

278
00:21:15,612 --> 00:21:18,182
Tigers?
No.

279
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:23,601
The tiger has nothing
but his claws and his fangs.

280
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,493
I heard some queer beast howling back
there along the water. Was that it?

281
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:39,157
It's no use, Rainsford.

282
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,836
He won't tell.

283
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,061
He won't even let you see
his trophy room...

284
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:48,180
till he gets ready to take you
on a hunt of the great whatsit.

285
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,267
My one secret. I keep it
as a surprise for my guests...

286
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:55,880
against the rainy day
of boredom.

287
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:58,622
Listen old boy,
you let me in on that game,

288
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,474
and I'll bet you
I go for it.

289
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,422
You know, Rainsford,
he hasn't failed yet.

290
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,430
If he says a thing is good,
it is good.

291
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,578
He's a judge of liquor,
wizard at contract,

292
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:12,313
plays the piano,
anything you want.

293
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:15,955
He's a good host
and a good scholar, eh, Count?

294
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,918
Yes, yes.

295
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:20,808
You want me to go hunting?
You just say the word. We're pals.

296
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:23,715
We'll have a big party,
get cockeyed and go hunting.

297
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,907
A completely civilised
point of view.

298
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:30,228
I tell you what you do. You come to my
place in the Adirondacks, sometime, see?

299
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,535
We'll have a private car,
liquor and gals on the trip,

300
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,593
and the guides
will make the deers behave.

301
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:41,724
I think we'd better
change the subject.

302
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:44,615
All right.
Change the subject.

303
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:47,016
Oh, I know!
Play the piano, huh?

304
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:48,854
If you wish.

305
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:53,315
Good idea. Play the piano.
Leave it to me, and I'll fix everything.

306
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:56,151
Perhaps the Count
doesn't want to play.

307
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,882
There you go, sis,
throwing cold water.

308
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:02,193
Leave me alone.
I know where the piano is.

309
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:04,618
I'm perfectly sober.

310
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:07,229
Charming simplicity.

311
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:09,353
"Completely civilised,"
did you say?

312
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:12,696
He talks of wine and women
as a prelude to the hunt.

313
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:15,747
We barbarians know
that it is after the chase,

314
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:18,572
and then only,
that man revels.

315
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,826
It does seem a bit
like cocktails before breakfast.

316
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:23,719
Of course, yes. You know the saying
of the Ugandi chieftains -

317
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:27,115
"Hunt first the enemy,
then the woman."

318
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,954
That's the savages' idea everywhere.

319
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,055
It is the natural instinct.

320
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:34,908
What is woman,
even such a woman as this,

321
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:38,739
until the blood is quickened
by the kill?

322
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,785
- Oh, I don't know.
- "Oh, I don't know."

323
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:44,118
You Americans.

324
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,052
One passion builds upon another.

325
00:23:47,122 --> 00:23:50,872
Kill! Then love.

326
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:53,123
When you have known that,

327
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:55,129
you will have known ecstasy.

328
00:23:58,142 --> 00:23:59,911
Oh, Martin!

329
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:05,676
Here you see Zaroff,
the keyboard king,

330
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,763
in his Branca Island hour.

331
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,861
Come on, Count.
Now, you show them.

332
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:12,651
- What do you suggest?
- Oh, just a good tune.

333
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:14,651
But not highbrow,
like last night.

334
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:17,923
- Just a good tune, see?
- I see.

335
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:45,768
Oh, his hunting dogs.

336
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,913
Keep your voice low
and listen.

337
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,618
It isn't true about the launch
needing repairs.

338
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:53,091
I heard it leave the boathouse
last night. It returned this morning.

339
00:24:53,384 --> 00:24:55,317
You mean he's keeping you
from returning to the mainland?

340
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:56,519
Yes.

341
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,007
Well, perhaps he enjoys the company
of two very charming people.

342
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:05,393
Two, maybe.
There were four of us a week ago.

343
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:09,393
- The other two have disappeared.
- What do you mean?

344
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:11,972
One night after dinner,
the count took one of our sailors...

345
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:13,988
down to see his trophy room...

346
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,720
at the foot of
those stone steps.

347
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:20,207
- That iron door?
- Yes.

348
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:22,790
Two nights later
he took the other there.

349
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,981
Neither has been seen since.

350
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,813
Have you asked him
about them?

351
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:30,190
He says they've gone hunting.

352
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,692
Oh, be careful.
He's watching us.

353
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,789
Will you smile,
as if I'd said something funny?

354
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,009
- Now look here.
You must be mistaken.  - Not now.

355
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:42,500
Applaud.

356
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,214
- Attaboy! Attaboy!
- Thank you.

357
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:52,093
What did I tell you?
Smacks a mean ivory, eh, Rainsford?

358
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,875
It was splendid.
Don't stop, please.

359
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,115
Now I'm afraid we have failed
to hold the full attention of our audience.

360
00:25:58,502 --> 00:26:01,577
Well, I expect it's rather
difficult for Mr Rainsford...

361
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,834
to concentrate on anything
after all he's been through.

362
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:06,704
My dear lady,
you are pleading for yourself.

363
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:10,771
I can see the drooping
of those lovely eyes.

364
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,901
Excuse me.

365
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,666
You know, the count's worse
than a family governess.

366
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,278
Every night he sends us off to bed
like naughty children.

367
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:22,059
Oh, no, my dear. No.

368
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:24,912
Charming children.

369
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,762
There, you hear that, sis?

370
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:33,156
Now trot along upstairs
and don't bother us grownups anymore.

371
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:36,507
Well, after that I guess,
I guess I'll have to go.

372
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,864
- Good night, Mr Rainsford.
- Good night.

373
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,889
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast.

374
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,837
- Good night.
- Good night.

375
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:46,364
Good night, sis. We won't
be seeing each other at breakfast.

376
00:26:50,153 --> 00:26:53,516
Oh, my dear Rainsford,
I have been most inconsiderate.

377
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:55,790
You must be feeling
the need of sleep too.

378
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:59,677
- Yes, I am just about all in.
- Then Ivan will show you to your room.

379
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,639
Oh, Martin,
turn in early, please?

380
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,969
Don't worry. The count'll
take care of me, all right.

381
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:15,288
Indeed I shall.

382
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:34,801
- Well, good night.
- Good night, sir.

383
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:36,346
Sleep well.

384
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:50,380
Oh well, here's to long life.

385
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,199
A long life.

386
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,642
Tell me, Mr Trowbridge,

387
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:58,389
are you also fatigued?

388
00:27:58,414 --> 00:27:59,871
Tired? Me?

389
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,990
You know I'm not.

390
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,239
You know, Rainsford,
we two are just alike.

391
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,305
Up all night and sleep all day.

392
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,605
Well, good night.

393
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,539
Well, what are we
going to do, huh?

394
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,629
What's the big idea?

395
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,210
I thought that perhaps...

396
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:28,429
tonight you would like
to see my trophy room?

397
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:30,052
Your trophy room?

398
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:34,065
I'm sure
you will find it most...

399
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,721
interesting.

400
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:39,148
Say, that's a great idea.

401
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:43,016
Ho-ho. Now we're pals.
No more secrets now, huh?

402
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:46,258
- We'll make a night of it.
- I hope so, Mr Trowbridge.

403
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,043
Just you and I, pals.
We'll have fun together, huh?

404
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:51,962
Precisely, yes.

405
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,785
Fun together.

406
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,322
Attaboy, County, old boy,
old boy, County.

407
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,530
Please let me come in.

408
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:42,738
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I'm frightened.

409
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,732
- What was it? Those dogs?
- My brother.

410
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:48,213
I've been listening for hours
for him to come upstairs.

411
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:51,056
I've just gone to his room.
He isn't there!

412
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:54,151
- He's probably somewhere with the Count.
- That's just what I'm afraid of.

413
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:58,426
Count Zaroff is planning something,
about my brother and me.

414
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:00,692
You don't really think anything
has happened to your brother?

415
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,665
Oh, I don't know,
but we've got to find him.

416
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,656
Won't you help me?

417
00:30:04,976 --> 00:30:07,236
Why, of course I'll help you.

418
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:11,127
- Where do you think he's gone?
- Where did the others go?

419
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,468
The iron door.

420
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,975
I'll meet you downstairs
in five minutes.

421
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:19,769
Thank you.

422
00:30:49,077 --> 00:30:51,512
That's queer.
It's unlocked.

423
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,779
Zaroff! He's coming down.

424
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:50,581
Back here, quick!

425
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,400
Where is my brother?

426
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,760
Where is my brother?

427
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,063
You killed him!

428
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,021
You killed my brother!

429
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,138
You!

430
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,317
Why, you...

431
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,808
Come, come, my dear Rainsford.

432
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:20,739
I don't want to treat you
like my other guests.

433
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:23,291
You and I,
we are hunters.

434
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,078
So that's
your most dangerous game.

435
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:31,590
Yes. My dear fellow,
I intended to tell you last night,

436
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:33,335
but you know, Miss Trowbridge...

437
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,546
You hunted him like an animal.

438
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:36,965
I know what you think,
but you are wrong.

439
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,796
He was sober and fit for sport
when I sent him out.

440
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,313
An hour or two strapped up in here
brought him to his senses.

441
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:45,659
You raving maniac!

442
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:49,477
Yes, yes, yes. I'll take it off
when we've finished.

443
00:33:49,587 --> 00:33:53,557
The stupid fellow tried to escape
through the swamps of Fog Hollow.

444
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:56,861
You see, when I first began
stocking my island,

445
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:59,491
many of my guests
thought I was joking,

446
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,178
so I established
this trophy room.

447
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,639
I always bring them here
before the hunt.

448
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,250
An hour with my trophies...

449
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,069
and they usually do their best
to keep away from me.

450
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:13,805
Where do you get
these poor devils?

451
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:18,815
Providence provided my island
with dangerous reefs.

452
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:22,017
But there are light buoys
to mark the safe channel.

453
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,980
They do not always mark it.

454
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,675
- You shifted them.
- Precisely right.

455
00:34:28,758 --> 00:34:31,239
Too bad your yacht
should have suffered,

456
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,603
but at least
it brought us together.

457
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:36,048
You take half-drowned men
from ships you've wrecked...

458
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,982
and drive them out
to be hunted.

459
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:40,533
I give them
every consideration,

460
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:42,752
good food, exercise,

461
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:45,287
everything to get them
in splendid shape.

462
00:34:45,312 --> 00:34:48,562
- To be shot down in cold blood.
- Oh, no, no.

463
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:51,120
Oh, I admit,
with this annoying fellow,

464
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:54,308
but usually I give them
hunting clothes,

465
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:57,629
a woodsman's knife
and a full day's start.

466
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,742
I even wait until midnight to give them
the full advantage the dark.

467
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,679
And if one eludes me
only till sunrise,

468
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:06,430
he wins the game.

469
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:10,446
Suppose he refuses
to be hunted.

470
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:16,047
Ivan is such an artist
with these.

471
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:22,461
Invariably, Mr Rainsford,
invariably they choose to hunt.

472
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:23,902
And when they win?

473
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:32,273
To date I have not lost.

474
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,641
Oh, Rainsford, you'll find
this game worth playing.

475
00:35:35,784 --> 00:35:39,325
When the next ship arrives,
we'll have gorgeous sport together.

476
00:35:39,443 --> 00:35:43,178
You murdering rat!
I'm a hunter, not an assassin.

477
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:46,617
Come, Rainsford.
Say you will hunt with me.

478
00:35:47,985 --> 00:35:49,480
Hunt men?

479
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:53,034
Say you will hunt with me!

480
00:35:58,593 --> 00:36:00,036
No?

481
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,893
What do you think I am?

482
00:36:03,768 --> 00:36:07,105
One, I fear, who dares not
follow his own convictions...

483
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,193
to their logical conclusion.

484
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:13,532
I'm afraid in this instance,
Mr Rainsford,

485
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:16,247
you may have to follow them.

486
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:19,732
What do you mean?

487
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:23,032
I shall not wait
for the next ship.

488
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:27,889
Four o'clock.
The sun is just rising.

489
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,622
Come, Mr Rainsford.
Let us not waste time.

490
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:51,188
Ivan.

491
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,686
Your fangs and claws,
Mr Rainsford.

492
00:37:00,705 --> 00:37:03,265
Bob! Bob!

493
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,739
Ivan.

494
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:20,196
Bob! Bob, what are they
going to do?

495
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,983
- I'm going to be hunted.
- Oh, no. No, Miss Trowbridge.

496
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,856
Outdoor chess.

497
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:26,769
His brain against mine.

498
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,295
His good craft against mine.

499
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,245
- And the prize?
- The prize?

500
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:37,001
You may recall
what I said last evening.

501
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:40,181
Only after the kill...

502
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:44,059
does man know
the true ecstasy of love.

503
00:37:45,503 --> 00:37:46,990
Suppose you lose.

504
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,670
If I do not,

505
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,923
what shall I say,
find you...

506
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:58,124
between midnight and sunrise tomorrow,
freedom for both of you.

507
00:37:58,251 --> 00:38:01,498
- I'm going with you.
- No. He'll kill you too.

508
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:04,456
Not at all.
One does not kill a female animal.

509
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,926
If you lose,
I can easily recapture her alive.

510
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:10,449
All right.
I'll take her with me then.

511
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,634
We'll set him a trail
he'll remember.

512
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:21,057
It's only fair to advise you
against Fog Hollow.

513
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:26,125
Outdoor chess, Mr Rainsford.

514
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:43,503
Don't lose your nerve.
We'll beat this thing.

515
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:45,848
- The others didn't.
- We will.

516
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:57,064
Come on.
Let's get going.

517
00:39:26,252 --> 00:39:28,199
It seems as though
we've come miles.

518
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:32,367
Yeah, but three hours
doesn't take you far in this jungle.

519
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:34,162
Come on.
Let's keep going.

520
00:39:34,712 --> 00:39:35,662
Come on.

521
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:47,550
Just a little more of this,
then easy downhill going.

522
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,502
We'll soon be safe.

523
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,678
No wonder he was so sure.

524
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,572
This island is no bigger
than a deer park.

525
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,428
Oh, Bob!

526
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,396
Come on, now.

527
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:26,455
What are we going to do?

528
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:30,713
We didn't each live through a shipwreck
to let this crazy man hunter worry us.

529
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:35,048
I shouldn't have come with you.
You might beat him if you were alone.

530
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:38,334
Alone? And leave you here
with that savage?

531
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,436
Not a chance.

532
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:45,063
Now we've got to think
of something to worry him.

533
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:47,901
You'd never get near him.
He'd shoot on sight.

534
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:50,561
Weapons aren't everything
in the jungle.

535
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:54,529
Say, did you notice that
leaning tree down there?

536
00:40:55,178 --> 00:40:58,973
- The one we just passed?
- Yes. I want to show you something.

537
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,898
You see? If that supporting branch
were cut away,

538
00:41:06,045 --> 00:41:08,213
this fallen tree would make
a perfect Malay deadfall.

539
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:09,747
A Malay deadfall?
What's that?

540
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:12,246
A man-killing contraption
the natives use.

541
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:14,692
It would stop that madman,
all right.

542
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:17,165
Trouble is, it takes
quite a few hours to build.

543
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:18,975
He said he wouldn't follow
till midnight.

544
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,289
That's right. If you help me,
I think we'll have time.

545
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:24,204
Come on.
We'll cut some strong vines.

546
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:31,160
There. Almost ready.

547
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:34,450
This bracelet of yours makes
a fine guide ring for my necktie.

548
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:37,705
He'll have been on his way
almost an hour now.

549
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,036
Look out!
Don't touch that trip line.

550
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,936
You'll have a two-ton tree
down on your back.

551
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:45,161
- Jungle wood's as heavy as iron.
- Will it really work?

552
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:48,239
I've never known a living thing
to get by one yet.

553
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:51,403
Look here.
You touch that trip line,

554
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,963
it'll pull that trigger free.

555
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,440
Once that's loose, there's nothing
to keep the log from coming down.

556
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,931
It'll crash down
and kill anything underneath it.

557
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:04,890
Look.

558
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:12,891
We're ready.
Let him come.

559
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:31,537
Give me that knife.

560
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:35,211
Come out, Rainsford.

561
00:43:35,434 --> 00:43:36,991
Why prolong it?

562
00:43:37,554 --> 00:43:39,387
I'll not bungle this shot.

563
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:41,393
You'll never even feel it.

564
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:46,500
But surely you don't think
that anyone who has hunted leopards...

565
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:49,019
would follow you
into that ambush?

566
00:43:55,236 --> 00:43:58,697
Oh, very well.
If you choose to play the leopard,

567
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:02,336
I shall hunt you
like a leopard.

568
00:44:20,948 --> 00:44:23,503
Wait. Maybe it's a trick.

569
00:44:47,376 --> 00:44:48,417
Eve.

570
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:00,988
Why did he go?

571
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:03,920
He's playing with us
like a cat with a mouse.

572
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,454
What do you mean?

573
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:07,646
You heard him say he'd hunt us
as he'd hunt a leopard.

574
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,898
That means he's gone
for his high-powered rifle.

575
00:45:09,923 --> 00:45:12,751
His rifle?
Oh, Bob, we must get away from here!

576
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:14,447
- Run, quick!
- Eve, wait.

577
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:39,151
- No, I tell you, no!
- Don't stop! No!

578
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:41,852
Wait. That's Fog Hollow ahead.

579
00:45:42,213 --> 00:45:45,014
- Fog Hollow?
- The swamp where he caught the others.

580
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:47,375
We haven't a chance
of keeping ahead of him there.

581
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,321
- But there's no place else to run.
- That's just what he's counting on.

582
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:54,056
We've got two hours till dawn. We've got
to use our brains instead of our legs.

583
00:45:54,124 --> 00:45:55,501
But he'll have his rifle.

584
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:58,279
And we'll have a man trap.
Look.

585
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:02,229
It makes me dizzy.

586
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:11,618
Cover this over.

587
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,691
When Mr Zarof falls down there,
he'll be all through hunting.

588
00:46:15,716 --> 00:46:18,416
Quick. Gather some leaves and grass.
I'll cut some branches.

589
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,730
Yes. Very good, Rainsford.

590
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:11,510
Very good.

591
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:14,085
You have not won yet.

592
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:17,013
Look at your watch.

593
00:48:19,669 --> 00:48:21,176
Are you looking at it?

594
00:48:21,887 --> 00:48:23,862
Still half an hour till sunrise.

595
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,958
Swamp or no swamp,
we can keep ahead of him that long.

596
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:31,154
As you are doubtless saying,
the odds are against me.

597
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:35,908
You have made my rifle useless
in the fog.

598
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:39,618
You cannot blame me
if I overcome that obstacle.

599
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:53,983
Those animals I cornered,
now I know how they felt.

600
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,667
Achmed, Miss Trowbridge,

601
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,813
bring her here.

602
00:57:00,225 --> 00:57:01,649
Now!

603
00:57:57,144 --> 00:58:00,323
My dear Rainsford,
I congratulate you.

604
00:58:08,232 --> 00:58:10,122
You have beaten me.

605
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:13,857
Not yet.

606
00:58:14,276 --> 00:58:16,860
Oh, but of course.
I insist.

607
00:58:22,948 --> 00:58:24,739
Why, you're...

608
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:27,932
you're not even wounded.

609
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,038
You hit the dog, not me.

610
00:58:30,165 --> 00:58:32,250
I took a chance
and went over with him.

611
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:36,438
A clever trick, Rainsford.

612
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,245
I cheerfully admit defeat.

613
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:44,321
Here's the key
of the boathouse.

614
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,163
The door is
in the trophy room.

615
00:58:48,455 --> 00:58:51,286
You and Miss Trowbridge
may leave at once.

616
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,427
No!

617
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,529
Ohh!

618
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:24,440
