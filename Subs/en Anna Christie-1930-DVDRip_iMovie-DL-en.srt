1
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:36,806
Either you're flat orl am.

2
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:39,102
I beg your pardon.

3
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,201
Excuse me.

4
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,372
Always the lady.

5
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:51,815
Say-- Say, what the--?

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,153
Why,I frighten your
hiccup away, Marthy.

7
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:57,022
Yes, you did.

8
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:01,894
And I'm going to hit you.

9
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:06,094
See here.
If you soak me in the eye again...

10
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:08,569
...I'm gonna quit you.

11
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:13,767
-You get me?
-No. Only on the back this time, Marthy.

12
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:16,746
I get you.

13
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,216
-Well,I think you lose them, Marthy.
-Yes.

14
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:26,482
Yes,I did.

15
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,016
Oh,I got it.

16
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:32,186
Ten-- Ten swallows of this
without breathing...

17
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:34,958
...and...sure cure.

18
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:40,537
One, two, three, four, five...

19
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:45,334
...1 0. MaybeI got hiccup too, Marthy.

20
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:57,620
See?I told you.
It's a sure cure, never fails.

21
00:02:57,789 --> 00:03:02,226
I think we got to go to Johnny the Harp
for get some more whiskey.

22
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:05,420
Yeah, well. Right you are, I'm bone dry.

23
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:08,122
Wait, I'll get my bonnet.

24
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,499
Johnny, he'll be surprised to see you
and me together once more.

25
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,503
Hold that, will you?

26
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:19,610
You're not sorry
you took me back, are you?

27
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:24,772
Oh, no, Marthy. I'm darn glad
I found you in Norfolk.

28
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,647
Aye, you been too old
to go walking streets, Marthy.

29
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:29,943
Old!

30
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:34,923
But you had better stay
with old Chris on the barge.

31
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:40,457
Well, I'm glad you found me.
Honest,I am.

32
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,026
Yeah, I'm glad to be here...

33
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,194
...dump that it is.

34
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:52,407
You're a good old punk.

35
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,472
-Come on.
-Yeah.

36
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:05,889
Marthy. Where are you going?

37
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,454
No, Marthy, no, we're in the boat, huh?

38
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:13,794
I forgot where the front door was.

39
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:17,298
-It's all right. It's all right with me.
-That's it, Marthy.

40
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,827
Oh, Marthy, hold my hand.

41
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:22,970
Hold my hand.

42
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,640
Well,I declare. How can you
do a thing like that?

43
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,780
Wait a minute, now. I'm all right.

44
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:31,745
I wasn't a tightrope walker for nothing.

45
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,384
See?

46
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,483
Oh, Marthy. Look out.

47
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:39,522
That's whatI get
for being a tightrope walker.

48
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:43,650
See, that's-- Where are we?

49
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:46,464
There we are.

50
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,459
-We go down and get a drink.
-No, wait, hon.

51
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,633
Oh, the horses. Oh, where are you?

52
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,232
-Here, Marthy.
-Old fool,I thought I'd lost you.

53
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:01,538
Just an old fool.

54
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,077
Come on. Here we go.

55
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:10,486
Come on. Oh, what was that?

56
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:17,923
Wait, wait. The doors.

57
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,600
Stopped.

58
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,000
-That's not funny.
-Marthy.

59
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,135
-There's the entrance.
-All right...

60
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:32,208
...wait, wait, wait.

61
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,542
Hold on.

62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,448
-Yeah.
-Listen.

63
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,947
You wait here, Marthy.

64
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:42,644
-I go let you in.
-Oh, all right.

65
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:46,714
''Ladies' entrance.''

66
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:49,994
Well, that's a g--

67
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:52,987
Well, why not?

68
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:58,033
Said she,
with all the dignity in the world.

69
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:02,467
-Well, hello, Johnny.
-Hello, Chris. How are you?

70
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:05,542
Come and have a drink on me.
Come on, Larry.

71
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,304
Drinks for the house,
and have one yourseIf.

72
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,812
Oh,I got money, plenty money.

73
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,576
Speak of the devil, Chris,
we was just talking about you.

74
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,188
-Hello, Chris, put it there.
-Larry, give us a drink.

75
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,016
You got haIf a snootfuI now.

76
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,650
Oh, I'm a little drunk, not much.

77
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:27,594
My Josephine
Come board the ship

78
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:30,496
Long time I wait for you

79
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,637
The moon, she shines

80
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:36,137
She looks just like you

81
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,072
Same old Josephine, eh, Chris?

82
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:41,735
Well, you don't know good song
when you hear it.

83
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:45,872
ltalian fellow on other barge,
he learn me that song.

84
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:49,179
Come on, get your drink. Skoal!

85
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:52,021
-Drink hearty.
-Here's how.

86
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:56,357
-Come on, Larry, order drinks--
-No, no. No, Chris.

87
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:59,088
Some other time. I've gotta go home.

88
00:06:59,264 --> 00:07:00,891
Where you in from this time?

89
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:04,968
Norfolk. Oh, we make a slow voyage...

90
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,766
...dirty weather, just fog.
Fog all the time.

91
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:12,375
No, no,I go, Larry.

92
00:07:12,544 --> 00:07:16,241
I forget, it's Marthy.
She come with me.

93
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,658
What's the matter with you,
you old punk?

94
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:30,317
Gonna keep me
standing out there all night?

95
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:34,026
I'm sorry, Marthy.
JustI talk with Johnny.

96
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,032
What you think you like
for drink, whiskey?

97
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,762
Well, I'll take a scoop of lager
and ale for a chaser.

98
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:42,771
I go bring back for you, Marthy.

99
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,580
Lager and ale for Marthy, Larry.
Whiskey for me.

100
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,911
Right you are. By the way, Chris,
we've got a letter for you...

101
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:54,676
...from St. Paul, Minnesota.

102
00:07:54,853 --> 00:07:56,787
And a lady's writing.

103
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:01,449
Then that must come from my
daughter, Anna. She living there.

104
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,320
I don't get letter from Anna,
must be year.

105
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:09,763
That's a fine fairy tale, your daughter.
Sure, I'll bet it's from some skirt.

106
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,368
Oh, no, this come from Anna.

107
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,771
I see....

108
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,280
By golly,I think I'm too drunk
to read that letter from Anna.

109
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,352
I thinkI go sit down for minute.

110
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,682
You bring drink in backroom, Larry.

111
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,380
All right.

112
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,870
Well, where's my lager and ale,
you old stiff?

113
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,879
Oh, Larry bring.
Larry bring, sweetheart.

114
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:01,345
How are you?

115
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,684
Good news?

116
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:12,227
Well, what do you got there?

117
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:15,298
Well, by jiminy,
what you think of that?

118
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:19,733
My daughter, Anna, say
she coming here right away.

119
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:25,035
She got sick on job
in St. Paul, she saying.

120
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,768
Let me see.

121
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:31,041
It's a short letter, it don't tell me
much more than that.

122
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:35,880
By golly, that's good news
all one time for old fella.

123
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:40,047
You know, Marthy,I told you
I don't see my Anna...

124
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:44,355
...since she was little girl
in Sweden, 5 year old.

125
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,227
How old will she be now?

126
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:52,563
Oh, she must be-- She must be
20 year old, by Jove.

127
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:56,104
-You've not seen her for 1 5 years?
-No.

128
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,204
I think it's better Anna live on farm.

129
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:03,404
Then she don't never know that....

130
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,516
That old deviI sea.

131
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:09,414
She don't know father like me.

132
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:12,690
This girI will marry a sailor herseIf, likely.
It's in the blood.

133
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,882
No, by golly, she don't do that.

134
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,825
Here! What are you trying to do,
spill my suds for me?

135
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:21,397
Oh, what's up with you?
Ain't you a sailor yourseIf?

136
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,501
Yes, and that's just whyI say it.

137
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:30,198
Sailor is all right fella,
but not for marry girl.

138
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:34,607
I know that.
Anna's mother, she know that too.

139
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,440
When is your daughter coming?
Soon?

140
00:10:36,614 --> 00:10:39,276
Why,I forget.I see.

141
00:10:39,717 --> 00:10:43,153
Well, she say she coming
right away, that's all.

142
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:47,621
She'll be coming here to look for you,
I suppose. Better hang around, Chris.

143
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:12,714
-Marthy--
-Well, what do you want?

144
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:17,915
I'm wise to what's
in the back of your nut...

145
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:20,613
...old squarehead.

146
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,360
You wanna get rid of me
because your kid's coming, huh?

147
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,656
Wanna kick me out, huh?

148
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:31,200
Well, see here, Chris. There
ain't no Swede on no boat...

149
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,361
...that's man enough
to get away with that.

150
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,407
Don't you start nothing you can't finish.

151
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:40,908
No,I don't start nothing, Marthy.

152
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,242
No, you don't.

153
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,882
You....

154
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:52,085
You're a scream.

155
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,288
Oh, honestly....

156
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,428
You're a knockout.

157
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:00,690
I don't see nothing for laugh at.

158
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:05,165
You don't? Go and take a slant
at yourseIf in the mirror.

159
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:10,267
Oh, gee.

160
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:13,410
Old squarehead, huh?

161
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:16,971
Trying to kid Marthy Owens, huh?

162
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:20,307
Oh, I'm onto the game.

163
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:25,817
I wasn't born and dragged up
on no waterfront for nothing.

164
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,659
You thought I'd make trouble, didn't you?

165
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,522
Not me.

166
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,727
I'm packing my duds
and I'm quitting you.

167
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,868
Yeah, I'm leaving you flat.

168
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:44,131
There's plenty of guys
on plenty of boats waiting for me.

169
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,568
Always was.

170
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:50,346
I always found them.

171
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,941
So cheer up, old squarehead.

172
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:59,921
I'll be out of the way
before your kid gets here.

173
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:04,755
You'll be rid of me for good,
and me of you.

174
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,496
-And good riddance to both of us.
-You. That's a good girl, Marthy.

175
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,700
Oh, ''good girl.''

176
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,895
Cut that bull.

177
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:22,638
Oh, well, you was always square
with me, so it's fifty-fifty...

178
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:28,518
...and nobody owes nobody nothing,
do they? Nobody's sore.

179
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,780
-Still friends?
-Oh, by golly, yes, Marthy.

180
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,754
Still friends.

181
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:40,794
Blow me another scoop of lager and ale,
and I'll drink your kid's health.

182
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:45,163
-And I'll--
-I'll do that, Marthy.I get it right away.

183
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:52,307
Another lager and ale for Marthy,
Larry. Whiskey for me.

184
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:04,148
My Josephine
Come board the ship

185
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:07,155
Long time I wait for you

186
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:09,722
The moon, she shines

187
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:13,728
-She looks just like you
-Oh, help us. Help us.

188
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:16,458
Help us, help us, help us.

189
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:20,092
Come on, get your drink, Marthy. Skoal!

190
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,975
I celebrate--I celebrate...

191
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:27,202
...because my Anna coming home.

192
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:32,975
You know, Marthy, my Anna--
What you think she look like, Marthy?

193
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:38,748
-I don't know.
-I bet you she's a fine, good, strong girl.

194
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:43,189
Pretty like everything because,
you know, live on the farm...

195
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,057
...they make them that way.

196
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,563
AndI bet you someday she marry...

197
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:53,101
...good, steady land fella here in East.

198
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,968
Have little house all her own.

199
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,266
Have kids!

200
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:03,471
Then I'm old grandfather, by golly.

201
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:06,481
By Jiminy Cricket,
we gotta celebrate that.

202
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,778
-Come on, Larry. Give us a drink, there.
-Wait.

203
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:11,547
You're soused to the ears,
that's what you are.

204
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:14,452
-Oh, you bet, you celebrate--
-I know,I know, but go on...

205
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,287
...put some food in you and sober up.

206
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:24,167
Here, you old fool. You don't know
when your kid's coming here, do you?

207
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:26,200
-Oh, well....
-Well...

208
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,964
...you wanna be sober
when she does get here, don't you?

209
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,200
-Oh, by golly, that's so, Marthy.
-Well, then...

210
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:36,244
...go throw a beef stew in you and--
Go on, around the corner.

211
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:40,109
I do that, Marthy.
I been coming right back.

212
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,752
Oh, well, that's that.

213
00:16:11,048 --> 00:16:14,779
Give me a whiskey.
Ginger ale on the side.

214
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:18,321
And don't be stingy, baby.

215
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:23,358
-Well, shalll serve it in a pail?
-Well, that suits me down to the ground.

216
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,824
Gee,I needed that bad, all right, all right.

217
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:59,292
Oh, sure. You look all in.
Have you been on a bat?

218
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,560
No. Traveling.

219
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,600
Day and a haIf on a train.

220
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:10,437
Had to sit up all night
in a dirty coach too.

221
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:13,034
I thought I'd never get here.

222
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,873
-Where'd you come from?
-St. Paul, out in Minnesota.

223
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:18,345
Minnesota?

224
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,041
Then you're the--?

225
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:25,417
All the way from Minnesota, sure.

226
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:30,726
Say, what are you laughing at? Me?

227
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:35,958
Oh, no. Sure, kid. No, l--
I was thinking of something else.

228
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,533
Well,I wouldn't blame you, at that.

229
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,936
I guessI do look rotten.

230
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,371
I'm just out of the hospitaI two weeks.

231
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:51,879
I'm gonna have another drink.

232
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,176
What do you say?
Will you have something on me?

233
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,285
Sure thing. Thanks. Larry?

234
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,490
Larry!

235
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:05,391
Little service here, please.

236
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:11,798
-Same for me.
-Oh, same here.

237
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:18,701
Sit over here. Let's be friends, yeah?

238
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:22,004
I'm a dead stranger
in this burg, you know.

239
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:56,970
-Skoal. Here's how, huh?
-Here's luck.

240
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,057
Let you smoke in here, won't they?

241
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:12,889
Sure, but throw it away
if you hear someone coming.

242
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,629
Well, ain't they fussy in this dump.

243
00:19:31,182 --> 00:19:33,377
ls there anything wrong with me?

244
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,212
You're sure looking hard enough.

245
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:39,516
I ain't gotta look very hard.
I got your number...

246
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,521
...the minute you come in the room.

247
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:43,926
ls that so?

248
00:19:44,195 --> 00:19:47,460
Well,I got yours too, without no trouble.

249
00:19:47,631 --> 00:19:51,158
You're me, 40 years from now.
That's you.

250
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:55,203
ls that so? Well,I wanna
tell you straight, kiddo...

251
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:58,671
...that Marthy Owens never--

252
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:02,645
Oh, let's cut out the scrapping.

253
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:07,207
I don't want no hard feelings
with no one.

254
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,146
-Come on, let's shake and be friends.
-Sure.

255
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:14,784
I ain't looking for trouble either.

256
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:19,624
Let's have another, huh?

257
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:23,164
Say, don't you think you'd better
go kind of easy on that stuff?

258
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:27,495
Well,I guess you're right.

259
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,773
I gotta meet someone too. My old man.

260
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:37,011
I ain't seen him sinceI was a kid.
Don't even know what he looks like.

261
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,775
I just got a letter now and then.

262
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,909
This was always the only address
he gave me to write him back.

263
00:20:44,088 --> 00:20:48,047
He used to be a sailor. He's a janitor
of some building here.

264
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:51,361
-A janitor?
-Sure.

265
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:57,523
AndI was thinking, seeing he ain't
done a thing for me in my life...

266
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:02,138
...he might be willing to stake me with
a room and eats untill could rest up.

267
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:08,505
ButI ain't expecting much from him.

268
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,083
Give you a kick when you're down,
that's what all men do.

269
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:18,353
AndI don't suppose he'll turn out
no better than the rest.

270
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,023
Do you hang around this dump much?

271
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:26,390
Oh, off and on.

272
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:30,330
Why, maybe you know him, my old man.

273
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:33,402
Well, it-- lt isn't old Chris, is it?

274
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:35,596
-Who, old Chris?
-Yeah, Chris Christopherson.

275
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,003
-That's his full name.
-That's him.

276
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,075
Anna Christopherson is my reaI name...

277
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:42,712
...only out there,I call myseIf
Anna Christie.

278
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,647
-So you know him, huh?
-Oh, I've seen him around here for years.

279
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:49,285
What kind is he?

280
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:53,651
Well, he's as fine an old guy
as ever walked on two feet...

281
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:56,292
...and that goes.

282
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,520
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

283
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:03,360
Why, you think he'll stake me
to the rest cure I'm after, then?

284
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:09,336
Surest thing you know. Where'd you
get the idea that he was a janitor?

285
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:12,669
Well, he wrote me he was himseIf.

286
00:22:12,843 --> 00:22:14,970
He's lying.

287
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:18,080
He's a captain on a barge.

288
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:22,618
A barge? What kind of a barge?

289
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:25,186
Well, coal, mostly.

290
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:28,416
A coaI barge?

291
00:22:32,363 --> 00:22:36,766
Well, well. If that ain't a swell job...

292
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:40,768
...to find your long-lost old man
working at.

293
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:45,036
Oh, gee.

294
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:48,741
Well, that puts the kibosh
on his giving me a rest.

295
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,575
Why? Couldn't you live on it too?

296
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:55,515
Who, me? On a dirty coaI barge?

297
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,483
Well, what do you thinkI am?

298
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:00,089
Well, what do you know about a barge?

299
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:03,351
Bet you ain't never seen a barge.

300
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:07,861
That's what comes of him bringing
you up inland where you'd be safe.

301
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:14,201
Say, his bringing me up,
is that what he tells people?

302
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,640
Well,I sure like his nerve.

303
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:21,904
Why, he let them cousins keep me on the
farm and work me to death like a dog.

304
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:25,771
Well, you didn't fall
for that farm life, did you?

305
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,115
I should say not.
I had to slave for all of them.

306
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,848
Was all right till my mother died...

307
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:36,788
...butI was only a poor relation,
you know...

308
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:41,091
...and they treated me worse
than they dared treat a hired girl.

309
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:46,195
Oh, what a life on that farm
out in Minnesota.

310
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,830
With them Swedes, woman-hungry.

311
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:59,443
One nightI was alone in the house
and one of the sons came back.

312
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:05,979
After that,I hated them,
so I'd kill them all ifI stayed...

313
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:08,814
...soI ran away. St. Paul.

314
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:12,759
Yeah,I overheard Chris saying as how
you was in St. Paul.

315
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,865
-Working, he said.
-Oh, that's no lie.

316
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:20,663
I went there to work, butI was still a kid.

317
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:27,367
It's all men's fault,
giving you the wrong start.

318
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:33,650
I'm just out of the hospitaI two weeks.

319
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:38,117
The judge gave all of us girls 30 days.

320
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:42,653
Well, the others didn't seem to mind
being in the cooler much.

321
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:47,229
ButI couldn't stand it.I went nuts.

322
00:24:47,598 --> 00:24:51,295
I never could stand
being caged up nowhere.

323
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:55,302
I got good and sick, and they had
to send me to the hospital.

324
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,067
And it was nice there.

325
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:02,679
I was sorry to leave it, honest.

326
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:13,347
If my old man doesn't help me...

327
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:16,152
...it's men again.

328
00:25:16,326 --> 00:25:20,387
Men all the time.

329
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:26,197
Oh, howI hate them,
every mother's son of them. Don't you?

330
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,362
Well, there's good ones
and there's bad ones, you know.

331
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,872
Now, your old man, old Chris.

332
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:35,409
Oh, he's a good one, honest.

333
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,106
Well, he'll have to show me.

334
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,345
Wait till he finds out.

335
00:25:41,518 --> 00:25:43,713
Well, you know,
he's kind of simple.

336
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:48,017
He's got nutty notions.
You know, he thinks that--

337
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:51,992
He thinks you're working
as a nurse girI in St. Paul.

338
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:58,465
You know, he thinks that-- He means all
right, honest. He thinks the world of you.

339
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,432
Honest, he does.

340
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:02,970
Quit your kidding.

341
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:06,302
Well, as soon asI get rested up...

342
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:11,505
...I'll clear out and get back
to the old job in St. Paul.

343
00:26:11,782 --> 00:26:14,080
Josephine
Come board the ship

344
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:17,482
Long time I wait for you

345
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,684
-What's up?
-That's him.

346
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:26,227
-Who?
-Your old man.

347
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:30,765
Golly, Larry. That grub, it taste good.

348
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:34,529
-ls Marthy in back?
-Sure, and another tramp with her.

349
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:39,037
That's him, you see.
He's coming in here.

350
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:41,109
Now, brace up.

351
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:45,281
Oh, hello, old Chris.

352
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:51,820
Say, listen, I'm gonna blow down to the
barge and pack my duds and beat it.

353
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:56,316
She's in there. Your Anna.

354
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:58,688
Yeah, she's just come.

355
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:01,726
She's waiting for you.

356
00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:04,459
And you treat her right.

357
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:07,500
She's been sick.

358
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:10,170
Well....

359
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:12,137
So long.

360
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:18,875
Well, so long, kid.I gotta beat it.

361
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,313
I'll see you later.

362
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,353
Anna.

363
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,496
Hello, Father.

364
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:10,132
She told me it was you.

365
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,030
I just got here a little while ago.

366
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:19,073
Oh, it's-- It's good for see you
after all them years, Anna.

367
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:23,870
Well, it's good to see you too.

368
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:28,478
Anna lilla. Anna lilla.

369
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:32,144
Oh,I had an awfuI trip getting here.

370
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:34,617
I'm all in.

371
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:40,194
Had a hard time finding
this place, too, you know.

372
00:28:40,364 --> 00:28:44,664
I've never been in
New York before, and....

373
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,894
I'm just out of the hospitaI two weeks.

374
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,564
You, Anna? Oh, by golly.

375
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:54,734
But you feeI better now,
though, don't you?

376
00:28:54,911 --> 00:28:57,402
You look little tired, that's all.

377
00:28:57,814 --> 00:28:59,748
I am...

378
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,612
...tired to death.

379
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:06,247
I need a long rest.

380
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:10,916
That's whyI made up my mind
to come and see you.

381
00:29:11,094 --> 00:29:16,555
I thought if you had a place where
maybe, if you didn't mind having me...

382
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:22,262
...I could rest up for a while. Untill felt
able to get back on the job again.

383
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:25,499
Oh,I got nice place for rest, Anna.

384
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:28,440
You rest all you want.

385
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:32,639
You don't never got to be
nurse girI no more.

386
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,046
You stay with me, by golly.

387
00:29:35,218 --> 00:29:38,915
You're really glad to see me, honest?

388
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:45,517
Oh, Anna, I'm glad more like
everything for see you,I tell you.

389
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:49,928
Don't you talk no more about getting job.

390
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,193
You stay with me.

391
00:29:53,937 --> 00:29:56,838
I don't see you for long time...

392
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:00,135
...and I'm getting old.

393
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:03,575
I got no one in world but you...

394
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:08,548
...and I'm going to tell you
about everything...

395
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:11,916
...and you tell me all thing
what happen to you.

396
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:15,081
But not here, now.

397
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:18,352
This ain't no good place for young girlies.

398
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:24,330
Only no-good sailor fella come here
for get drunk. You come with me.

399
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:27,868
You need lie down, get a rest.

400
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:31,439
-Where are you going?
-We go onboard.

401
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:34,771
-Onboard your barge, you mean?
-Aye.

402
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:37,641
Well, nix for mine.

403
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:43,243
Do you think that's a good place
for a young girl? CoaI barge?

404
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,082
Yeah,I think, Anna.

405
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:49,885
You don't know how nice is on barge.

406
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,894
Tug come, he tow us out on voyage.

407
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:56,726
You got just water all around.

408
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,963
Sunshine, fresh air, plenty good grub for--

409
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:05,734
For make you strong, healthy girI again.

410
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:08,844
You need a rest like that.

411
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:13,073
You work too hard for young girI already.

412
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,844
You need vacation, eh?

413
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:19,455
Well, it sounds pretty good,
to hear you tell it.

414
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:23,320
I'd sure like a trip on the water, all right.

415
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:27,227
I'll go down with you and have a look.

416
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:30,093
Maybe I'll take a chance.

417
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:36,037
Seeing America from a coaI barge,
that's a good one.

418
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:37,537
We go?

419
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:42,007
Wait a second. What's the rush?

420
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:48,407
-Gee, I'm thirsty.
-Oh, I'm sorry, Anna.

421
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:50,951
What you think you like for drink?

422
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:53,055
Well, I'll take a....

423
00:31:55,025 --> 00:31:59,189
Oh,I don't know, really.
What have they got here?

424
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:05,161
I don't think they got much fancy drink
for young girI in this place.

425
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:11,069
Well, say, ginger ale
or sarsaparilla, maybe.

426
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,936
Well, make it sarsaparilla.

427
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:17,011
I tell you, Anna, we celebrate,
just this once...

428
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,115
...because we meet after many year.

429
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:22,877
They got some good port wine.

430
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:28,514
Now, that's good for you,I think.
lt ain't strong, neither.

431
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:31,752
One glass, he don't go to your head,
I promise.

432
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:37,867
-All right. I'll take port.
-I go get it.

433
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,170
Well, who's the blond?

434
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:45,933
That's Anna, Larry.

435
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:47,770
-Your daughter, Anna?
-Aye.

436
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:50,105
Don't you think she's pretty girl, Larry?

437
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,975
Sure, a peach.

438
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:56,175
You give me drink for take back.
One port wine for Anna.

439
00:32:56,353 --> 00:33:00,153
She celebrate with me just this once.

440
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:03,891
Small beer for me, please.

441
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,518
Small beer for you?
She's reforming you already.

442
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:08,823
You bet.

443
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:12,858
I can't stand it.

444
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:16,171
I better beat it.

445
00:33:17,641 --> 00:33:20,007
I take back, Larry.

446
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:39,084
Why, you look a little tired, Anna...

447
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:42,663
...butI make you take
good, long rest now.

448
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:44,663
You drink your wine.

449
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,860
That put new life in you.

450
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:50,973
Skoal, Anna.

451
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,541
You know that Swedish word?

452
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:56,245
Skoal.

453
00:33:57,013 --> 00:34:00,346
I guessI know that word,
all right, all right.

454
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:08,173
A bridge, Anna, it's pretty, eh?

455
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:13,084
Gives you the creeps, though.
It's like a great big spiderweb.

456
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:16,157
Oh, you're tired, you sick, Anna.

457
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:19,625
Someday, bridge, he look
awfully pretty to you.

458
00:35:19,796 --> 00:35:24,699
I bet your life those big buildings
make you open your eyes.

459
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:28,429
Well, it scares me
to think of being up so high.

460
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:30,368
I bet we look like ants to them.

461
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,906
I bet they can't even see us down here.

462
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:36,239
On trip back,
I take you up in Woolworth Building.

463
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:38,779
There you see everything.

464
00:35:38,948 --> 00:35:41,883
I've seen too much already.

465
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:45,021
You know, Anna, you was
awfuI pretty girl.

466
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:49,124
I bet you all men see you
fall in love with you, by Jiminy.

467
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:53,092
You cut that.
You talk just as they all do.

468
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:55,925
No harm your father talk that way, Anna.

469
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:00,468
Oh, fine father you are. Like a stranger.

470
00:36:00,637 --> 00:36:02,628
Why didn't you ever
come out west to see me?

471
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:05,969
I'm sorry, Anna,
but after your mother die...

472
00:36:06,142 --> 00:36:09,305
...I want come see you
end of every voyage...

473
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:13,245
...but whenI get money
for coming west,I forget.

474
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,517
I get drunk and spend all money.

475
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:21,419
I don't know why, Anna,
but that's the way with most sailor fella.

476
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,718
That old deviI sea.

477
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:29,695
She make them crazy fools
with her dirty tricks. ls so.

478
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:32,994
Well, it's good you got something
to blame it on.

479
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:34,659
Kind of tough for me, though.

480
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:39,537
I know, Anna, I'm sorry.
But if you stay with me,I make you glad.

481
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:44,703
I make you forgive me
for being no-good father.

482
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:50,342
lt sounds okay with me.
I'll try anything once.

483
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:03,631
I'm glad you like it here on barge
with your old father, Anna.

484
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,768
Who saidI like it?

485
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:08,233
Well, you change a lot in one week.

486
00:37:08,404 --> 00:37:11,202
The sea air make you feeI good again, eh?

487
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:14,343
Maybe.I don't know.

488
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:17,974
Four bells. What time is that?

489
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,945
Six o'clock.

490
00:37:20,216 --> 00:37:24,414
Funny, all this sea talk.
I'm getting onto the lingo.

491
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:38,160
Now, there's where you belong,
on a reaI ship like that...

492
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:41,030
...sailing all over the world.

493
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:44,670
I do that many year whenI was big fool.

494
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:46,866
Oh, rats.

495
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:50,905
Say, was all the men in our family
always sailors?

496
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,244
Yes. All men in our family crazy fools.

497
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:59,081
My father and my three brothers
is buried at sea...

498
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:04,090
...lost on sailboat.
Just like your brothers was drowned.

499
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,061
Sailor man is no good, Anna.
They don't never come home.

500
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:12,633
Don't never do nothing
what good men do.

501
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:18,434
And sooner or later, that old devil,
she swallow them up.

502
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:23,443
But she don't gonna got me.
No, by Jiminy, not me.

503
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:26,338
Beefing about the sea again.

504
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:32,544
Well, I'm getting soI kind of like it.

505
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:55,577
Old man?

506
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,910
Father.

507
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:04,481
Father!

508
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:36,579
Anna, you was scaredI got hurt.

509
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:39,984
Oh, gee,I thought you were
overboard, honest.

510
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,551
You been sorry if that old devil,

511
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,059
Why, sure. Ain't you my father?

512
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:53,533
Oh, that's a sure thing.
You like me little, maybe?

513
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:57,639
Can the sentiment, Pa.
I'll fix you a whiskey toddy.

514
00:39:57,807 --> 00:40:00,537
I'll pull off your boots first, though.

515
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:04,973
Oh, Anna, you make old fella
want to cry.

516
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:08,083
Nix on the sob stuff now.

517
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:11,812
Heave, hearty!

518
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:16,948
Oh, don't go away, Anna,
don't go away.

519
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,720
You was my little girl.

520
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:24,993
My Anna lilla. Anna lilla.

521
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,517
Anna.

522
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:49,948
-Anna.
-Yes. HereI am. What do you want?

523
00:40:50,126 --> 00:40:55,029
Why you don't come turn in, Anna?
It's late, it's after four bells.

524
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,765
I like this fog, honest.

525
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:01,461
lt makes me feeI as ifI was
out of things altogether.

526
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,468
Fog.

527
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,075
That's one of the worst dirty tricks
of that old devil.

528
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:11,603
Funny.I feeI sort of strange tonight.

529
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,174
Sort of nutty...

530
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:19,754
...as if I've been living
a long, long time out here in the fog.

531
00:41:20,656 --> 00:41:23,921
I don't know just how to tell you
whatI mean.

532
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:28,694
But it's like I've come home
from a long visit someplace...

533
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,592
...andI seem to have forgotten
all that's happened.

534
00:41:33,936 --> 00:41:36,166
Like it didn't matter anymore.

535
00:41:37,874 --> 00:41:39,842
You must think I'm off my base.

536
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:43,103
Oh, Anna,I want always
make you happy.

537
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:47,040
We fooI that old devil. We sell barge.

538
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:51,175
And you and me, we live together
in nice little house inland.

539
00:41:51,354 --> 00:41:54,289
lnland? You mean leave the sea?

540
00:41:54,457 --> 00:41:57,620
By golly, we have a little house,
just you and me...

541
00:41:57,794 --> 00:42:01,321
...and maybe sometime comes along
a nice land fella.

542
00:42:01,497 --> 00:42:04,261
You get married. You have kids.

543
00:42:04,434 --> 00:42:09,371
Oh, by Jiminy,
that sure is a pretty picture, Anna.

544
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:12,906
Maybe.I wanna be with you...

545
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:15,804
...but somehow
I don't wanna leave the sea.

546
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:20,244
She's old devil, Anna.
Don't let her get you.

547
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:24,944
Well, ain't it natural, me loving the sea?
It's in the blood, ain't it?

548
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:29,720
I think I'm a big fooI for bring you
on this voyage, Anna.

549
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,389
Now you're talking nutty yourseIf.

550
00:42:32,562 --> 00:42:35,395
You act as if you were scared
something was gonna happen.

551
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:40,059
-Only God know that, Anna.
-Well, then, it'll be God's will...

552
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:42,227
...like the preachers say,
what does happen.

553
00:42:42,438 --> 00:42:45,999
No. That old devil, she ain't God.

554
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:50,169
Ahoy!

555
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:53,772
Ahoy!

556
00:42:55,017 --> 00:42:57,508
Ahoy!

557
00:42:57,687 --> 00:43:00,986
-What's that?
-Oh, that scare me for a minute.

558
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:04,285
ls just some fisherman
lose his course in fog.

559
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:08,697
Sound come from this side.

560
00:43:08,865 --> 00:43:11,459
They come in from open sea.

561
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,760
Ahoy!

562
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:17,099
What's trouble?

563
00:43:17,273 --> 00:43:20,504
Heave a rope when we come alongside.

564
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,173
-Where are you, you scut?
-This way!

565
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:27,577
Right you are.

566
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,479
Why don't he stay where he belongs.

567
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:31,517
Johnson, come and give a hand.

568
00:43:31,687 --> 00:43:33,746
Anna, you go in cabin,
get whiskey, please.

569
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:36,187
Those fellas will need a drink
for fix them up.

570
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,090
Johnson, come here.
Give me a hand here with this fella.

571
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:42,527
-What is it, sir?
-They come in from the open sea.

572
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:46,361
-Must be sailor fellas.
-The open sea?

573
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:50,632
That old deviI is doing
something again, Johnson.

574
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,672
Three of them there.

575
00:43:58,981 --> 00:44:03,645
-Did you see them there, Johnson?
-Sure, a couple of them is out.

576
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:13,624
Make fast rope there, you fella.

577
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:16,588
Right you are. Heave away.

578
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:19,095
Come in here.

579
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:25,405
-Johnson.
-Johnson, you get that other fella there.

580
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,440
Right away.

581
00:44:35,818 --> 00:44:37,615
Anna, get whiskey, quick.

582
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,013
These here sailor fellas...

583
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:45,491
...their steamer got wrecked in storm.
Been five days in open sea.

584
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:49,256
Johnson brings another fella.
You take whiskey to him.

585
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:55,002
Take your whiskey, here.

586
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:04,344
Are these all?

587
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:08,279
I'll get whiskey inside. Take that to
the man's who's coming onboard now.

588
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:17,025
What's this tub?

589
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:21,258
Well, we're safe anyhow,
with the help of God.

590
00:45:53,562 --> 00:45:58,397
Sure, it's me, Matt Burke himseIf,
dreaming again.

591
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:04,296
You drink this
and you'll find it's no dream.

592
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,907
The deviI with the drink.

593
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:09,567
But I'll be taking it anyhow.

594
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:21,748
Sure, I'm needing that.
It's fine stuff.

595
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:25,221
But it wasn't the drinkI meant
whenI said, wasI dreaming.

596
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:29,558
Sure,I thought you was some mermaid
out of the sea, come to torment me.

597
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:32,390
Aye, reaI flesh and blood, deviI the less.

598
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:34,092
Cut that.

599
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,637
What's a fine, handsome woman
the like of yourseIf doing on this scow?

600
00:46:37,807 --> 00:46:39,741
Never you mind.

601
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:44,374
You're a great one, honest. Starting right
in kidding after what you've been through.

602
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:48,882
I'm telling you, but for the strength
and guts in me, we'd be scoffed...

603
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:50,678
...by the fishes this minute.

604
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:53,447
Gee, you hate yourseIf, don't you?

605
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:56,614
But you must come and lie down
and go to sleep.

606
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:59,454
Lie down and sleep, is it?

607
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:02,623
But you'll not be thinking
I'm a weak scut.

608
00:47:02,798 --> 00:47:07,201
Sure,I could lick any man on this boat
with one hand tied behind me back.

609
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:11,067
I could lick all hands on this tub
one by one, tired asI am.

610
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,765
Ain't you the hard guy, though, huh?

611
00:47:13,943 --> 00:47:17,401
But never mind that fight talk.
I'll take your word for what you say.

612
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,104
You're all in, own up to it.

613
00:47:19,281 --> 00:47:20,680
The devill am.

614
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,978
Well, be stubborn, then, for alll care.

615
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:26,644
AndI must sayI don't care
for your language.

616
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:29,620
The menI know don't pull rough stuff
when ladies are around.

617
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:33,626
Ladies! Let you not be making
game of me.

618
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:36,492
Whisht, now, milady,
it's one of your kisses I'm needing...

619
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:39,498
...to take the tiredness from me bones.
One kiss, now.

620
00:47:39,668 --> 00:47:42,933
Let go of me, you--!

621
00:47:50,312 --> 00:47:54,009
Oh, gee,I was scared for a moment
I'd killed you.

622
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:55,673
''Killed you,'' you say?

623
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:59,685
Faith, it would take more than a bit
of a blow to crack my thick skull.

624
00:47:59,855 --> 00:48:03,723
Glory be, you got a power
of strength in them fine arms of yours.

625
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:07,290
Forget it. I'm sorry it happened.

626
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:10,565
Only, you've no right
to be getting fresh with me.

627
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,528
Listen, now, don't go getting
any more wrong notions.

628
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:16,796
I'm on this barge because
I'm making a trip with my father.

629
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:19,099
The captain is my father.
Now you know.

630
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:21,402
I'm sorry.

631
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:25,008
I'm thinking I'm not good enough
to kiss the shoe soles...

632
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:27,581
...of a fine, decent girl
the like of yourseIf.

633
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,617
Will you forgive me now
and let's be friends from this out?

634
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:34,722
I'm thinking I'd rather be friends
with you than anything else in the world.

635
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,484
-Sure.
-God bless you.

636
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:41,427
lt is a clumsy apeI am.

637
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:45,658
Sure, it is great powerI have in me hand
and arm, andI do be forgetting it at times.

638
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:48,770
You're sure strong, all right.

639
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:50,667
Sure, it is the will of God in it...

640
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,673
...that brought me safe
through the storm to the one spot...

641
00:48:53,876 --> 00:48:57,141
...in the world where you was.
Think of that, now, and isn't it queer?

642
00:48:57,313 --> 00:49:00,339
Anna, you get in cabin, you hear?

643
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:03,383
Who do you think
you're talking to, a slave?

644
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:05,611
You need to rest, Anna.

645
00:49:05,788 --> 00:49:07,949
What are you doing here,
you sailor fella?

646
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:09,818
You ain't sick like others.

647
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:13,587
You get in forecastle, they give you bunk.
You hurry,I tell you.

648
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:16,287
But he's sick. He can hardly stand up.
Look at him.

649
00:49:16,465 --> 00:49:19,127
ls it giving me orders you are, me bucko?

650
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:20,928
Let you look out, then.

651
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:23,071
Weak asI am,
I can break you in pieces...

652
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:26,538
...and throw you over the side,
and your crew after you.

653
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:32,978
I was forgetting, you're her old man.
Sure, I'd not lift a fist to you for the world.

654
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:37,919
Come inside. You can have my bed
if there is no other place.

655
00:49:44,126 --> 00:49:49,029
That's your dirty trick, old devil...

656
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:55,364
...but you don't do that,
no, not that whileI live.

657
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:16,150
Mulligan! Sure, it is myseIf that's hungry.

658
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:17,792
And a pie, Matt.

659
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,724
Glory be, what doI care
for a stew or a pie?

660
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:22,523
It's not for food I'm hungry...

661
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:27,499
-...but for the sight of your face.
-Oh, go on with your blarney, you gasbag.

662
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:31,836
Now, Matt, look what you've done.
Pick that up. Shame on you.

663
00:50:32,007 --> 00:50:35,841
Sure, her with the face of an angel
and the sting of a wasp.

664
00:50:36,011 --> 00:50:38,502
Oh, so it's darning you're doing.

665
00:50:47,489 --> 00:50:49,650
Shut up.
You've got a voice like a foghorn.

666
00:50:49,825 --> 00:50:51,087
What's this?

667
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,659
Well, what do you think it is?

668
00:50:52,828 --> 00:50:56,559
Well, holding it up this way, it might be
new underdrawers for old Chris.

669
00:50:56,732 --> 00:50:58,791
-Ain't for him, though.
-Oh, ain't it, now?

670
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,765
-For some sweetheart?
-Maybe.

671
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:03,564
Don't make me jealous,
or I'll burn it up and him in it.

672
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:06,264
-No. Give it to me.
-You got a guilty look in your eye.

673
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:09,172
Now, you give it to me, now. You bully.

674
00:51:09,345 --> 00:51:10,642
Now....

675
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,144
Don't!

676
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:20,252
-Look what you've done, galoot.
-WhenI get ahold of him that wears it...

677
00:51:20,422 --> 00:51:23,414
...I'll pull out an arm and wave you
goodbye with it.

678
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:25,389
Supper's almost ready.

679
00:51:25,561 --> 00:51:28,223
Well, I've been hungry.

680
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,371
Well, asI was saying to you before....

681
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,610
Stand up, just to measure this sweater.

682
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:45,679
Sure,I will. On me head or me feet?

683
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:48,146
Your feet, silly.

684
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:51,380
lt is only prayer
or paralysis can save you now, Anna.

685
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:53,111
Well, I'm praying, Matt.

686
00:51:53,288 --> 00:51:55,848
lt is a miracle
if your prayers are answered.

687
00:51:56,225 --> 00:52:00,685
Thanks, Matt. It's for my father. And him
hating to stand up for measurements.

688
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:03,331
-Will you wear it for my sake?
-Oh, yeah.

689
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:05,467
lt is a lie in your throat
and you know it.

690
00:52:05,634 --> 00:52:07,431
No, it isn't.

691
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:13,002
You made it for me
with your own blessed hands.

692
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:16,770
And I'll wear it when we dock in New
York and take you out for a day's fun.

693
00:52:16,945 --> 00:52:19,778
Oh, no, you won't.
lt won't be finished by then.

694
00:52:19,948 --> 00:52:22,075
I won't go with you.
Make up your mind to that.

695
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:24,219
-Yes, you'll go with me.
-Oh, no,I won't.

696
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:25,910
-Just the two of us.
-Oh, no.

697
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:28,249
Oh, yes. Oh, yes, you will.

698
00:52:53,248 --> 00:52:58,276
Well, you won the capitaI prize, fella.
Help yourseIf.

699
00:52:58,454 --> 00:53:00,718
Anybody else around?
Here we go, boys.

700
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,559
Why don't you test your lungs too, Matt.

701
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:08,288
I should test them,
with the fine bellows thatI got?

702
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:09,954
Well, try it.

703
00:53:10,132 --> 00:53:14,000
Faith, that's a woman's game.
Not for a husky like me. You try it, Anna.

704
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:17,866
No, Matt. You do it.I haven't got
the wind in me that you have.

705
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,473
Hand it over.

706
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:23,509
Watch me. Sure, I've air enough
in me chest to blow up a balloon.

707
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:25,544
Well,I don't doubt it.

708
00:53:30,185 --> 00:53:31,948
What do you mean, you don't doubt it?

709
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:34,446
I was just kidding.

710
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:40,522
I bet he goes to 40.

711
00:53:40,696 --> 00:53:42,357
Oh, boy.

712
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:47,093
Step up and roll the sweet mamas
out of their beds.

713
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,134
Make your own sweet mama jealous.

714
00:53:49,304 --> 00:53:53,638
Only 25 cents to see the most
enchanting scene on Coney lsland.

715
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:57,006
Now there's Lily and Clytie
without any nighties.

716
00:53:57,179 --> 00:53:58,669
Hey, you, step right up.

717
00:53:58,847 --> 00:54:02,180
Give us a good free look at the mamas
in their pretty lace hootenannies.

718
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:04,852
Wanna keep us
in bed all night, tightwad?

719
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,648
Loosen up, lads. Give us a little tumble.

720
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:11,850
I'll bet you couldn't hit that target if you
stayed untiI you grew a long, white beard.

721
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:14,052
-The devill couldn't.
-Come on, Matt.

722
00:54:14,229 --> 00:54:16,595
Go on and try it.
Bet you can't even hit the net.

723
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:19,962
-Yeah, how about a home run, Babe Ruth?
-Sure,I dare you to.

724
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:23,263
With one throw,I could knock them
dames off of their bunks.

725
00:54:23,438 --> 00:54:24,996
Go to it, big boy.

726
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:29,539
Don't overlook me, carrot top.I have the
shape that makes the old men young...

727
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:32,009
-...and the young men old.
-Attaboy.

728
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,557
-Mama wants Papa.
-Papa wants Mama.

729
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,164
Some mamas too. Now somebody else.

730
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,062
Somebody that packs a mean right.

731
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:55,669
What we want this time
is a regular he-man.

732
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,033
You shut up or I'll wrap you
around the target.

733
00:54:58,207 --> 00:54:59,435
Don't get sore, big boy.

734
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:01,735
It's a hot night.
Roll me out of the blanket.

735
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:23,256
And that be the end to the story
of the whale and the grasshopper.

736
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:27,792
Oh, Matt, honest,
I ain't ever laughed like this.

737
00:55:28,103 --> 00:55:30,537
-You're funny.
-Sure, I'd think it was blarney...

738
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:33,038
...if it wasn't meseIf
was making you laugh.

739
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:38,842
Oh, sure, Anna, you're crazy about me,
and I'm not after blaming you.

740
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:44,011
You just hate yourseIf, don't you, Matt?

741
00:55:44,186 --> 00:55:46,086
Oyster loaf for the lady, sir.

742
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,696
-I ordered milk for the lady.
-Well, I've got it here.

743
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:04,334
Well, let's drink to our good health.

744
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,467
Here's to you.

745
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:13,439
And skoal, Matt, to you and me.

746
00:56:22,157 --> 00:56:24,148
-Hot mustard, Matt?
-I don't need it.

747
00:56:24,326 --> 00:56:26,317
-Pepper?
-Full of it.

748
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:30,664
-Well, here's something you do need.
-Oh, is that so, now?

749
00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:36,270
Well, all right. But if I'm needing sugar,
I know where to look for that.

750
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:41,205
Oh, we're goofy, Matt.
Just like a couple of kids.

751
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:45,506
Sure, Anna, when you're in love,
you ain't got the brains of a tick.

752
00:56:46,882 --> 00:56:48,816
What do you mean, love?

753
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:50,918
You know whatI mean, Anna.

754
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:54,385
It's in me eye and
on the tip of me tongue.

755
00:56:56,491 --> 00:56:59,949
A man like me ain't given to loving
a woman. He knows too much about them.

756
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,995
Every color of them,
from here to the China Sea.

757
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:07,124
The whole lying, cheating smear of them.
Sailors' bait.

758
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,163
When he comes across
a girI like you, Anna...

759
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:12,034
...that's as clean as a shell.

760
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:15,608
You're a lucky girI to be hearing
such talk from the lips of Matt Burke...

761
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:18,405
...him that the women are so crazy over.

762
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:21,649
Anna, what's come over you?

763
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,614
Oh, nothing.

764
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:26,955
Sure, don't lie to me, Anna.
You're as stiff as a corpse.

765
00:57:27,122 --> 00:57:29,215
Hello, dearie.

766
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:31,723
-Well, I'll be--
-Well, she's a friend of mine.

767
00:57:31,893 --> 00:57:33,292
Aren't you, dearie?

768
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:37,631
I'm afraidI don't remember you.

769
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:41,959
-She don't remember me.
-Of course she don't, you old scab.

770
00:57:42,137 --> 00:57:47,336
-Beat it, or I'll have you thrown in the brig.
-No, Matt, maybeI do know her.

771
00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:52,004
That old sea cow?
Go on, clear out of here.

772
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,740
You know a nice young girl
never met the likes of you.

773
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:57,009
A nice young--?

774
00:57:57,753 --> 00:58:00,813
A nice young--
Pure and white as a lily.

775
00:58:00,989 --> 00:58:03,457
Shut up, or I'll choke the wind
out of your gullet.

776
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:07,152
Oh, Matt, let her alone.

777
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:09,993
She don't mean nothing by it.

778
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:13,157
Anna. Anna, darling.

779
00:58:13,735 --> 00:58:15,896
You see what you've done?
You frightened her.

780
00:58:16,171 --> 00:58:19,334
-Go on, clear out of here.
-I'm going, I'm going.

781
00:58:19,508 --> 00:58:21,203
Let her alone.

782
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:23,909
Don't go.

783
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:26,110
I was lying, Matt.

784
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:28,579
I know her and she knows me.

785
00:58:29,017 --> 00:58:31,747
I recognized her the minute
she stepped across the room.

786
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,880
Shut up, kid. You don't have to
spill over for nobody.

787
00:58:37,225 --> 00:58:41,059
You ain't responsible
for what your old man does.

788
00:58:42,297 --> 00:58:45,528
I'll tell you why
she didn't want to talk to me.

789
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,669
Because I'm a tramp, that's why.

790
00:58:48,837 --> 00:58:53,604
And her old man kicked me off the barge
when she come there to live on it.

791
00:58:53,775 --> 00:58:59,213
Yeah, he didn't want any old wharf rat
around a nice young girl.

792
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:03,377
Well, it ain't so, though, Matt.
She's lying.

793
00:59:03,552 --> 00:59:05,076
Lying, I'm ly--?

794
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:09,121
Well,I like your nerve,
all right, all right.

795
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:13,660
Gee, I'm sorryI came here
to speak to you.

796
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:19,096
lnsulting me. Well, can you beat it?

797
00:59:20,168 --> 00:59:22,864
I'll be toddling along.

798
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:30,138
I'm glad you found yourseIf
such a nice, friendly gent.

799
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:36,048
I hope you're happy, kid.

800
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:43,622
I'm sorryI bothered you, honest, l--
Oh, forget it, Ann.

801
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:46,886
You only got one life to live.

802
00:59:47,395 --> 00:59:50,421
And it's a...of a life at that.

803
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:56,526
Say, skipper, you wouldn't stake me
to a quarter, would you?

804
00:59:56,705 --> 01:00:00,698
You know,I haven't had
a drink in a month.

805
01:00:06,615 --> 01:00:08,378
Take it and beat it.

806
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:11,951
With pleasure, captain.

807
01:00:12,787 --> 01:00:15,449
Well, so long.

808
01:00:15,824 --> 01:00:19,988
Be a good girl, Ann,
no matter how lonesome.

809
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:24,363
Happy days. Happy days.

810
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,102
The poor old devil.

811
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:35,875
SometimesI feeI sorry for them.

812
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,838
Come on, Anna. Don't let it get you down.
Sure, the world's full of them.

813
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:45,515
I know it's a sad sight for a decent
young girI the like of yourseIf, darling.

814
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:49,487
What would you say, Matt,
ifI told you that...?

815
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:53,285
Say what, me darling? Tell me what.

816
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:56,528
Oh, nothing.

817
01:00:57,165 --> 01:01:00,726
Sure,I know what you'll be wanting
to tell me soon, if not this minute...

818
01:01:00,902 --> 01:01:02,733
...that you love me.

819
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:09,567
Don't be so sure of yourseIf, Matt.
I'm loving nobody.

820
01:01:09,978 --> 01:01:14,847
And you'll be wanting to marry me,
and maybe I'll be accepting you.

821
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,710
Why, Matt.

822
01:01:20,188 --> 01:01:24,090
You want to marry me?

823
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:27,194
-Honest?
-Sure, I'll marry you.

824
01:01:27,929 --> 01:01:32,423
Only, don't be putting me to too many
tests, orI might change me mind.

825
01:01:38,473 --> 01:01:40,566
I'm tired, Matt.

826
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,336
I wanna go back to the barge.

827
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:09,033
You-- You think you love
that sailor fella, Anna?

828
01:02:09,204 --> 01:02:11,172
Well, what ifI do?

829
01:02:11,439 --> 01:02:14,340
You think maybe you marry him?

830
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:19,210
No.

831
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:24,751
I'm glad you don't marry sailor, Anna.
ls bad for woman.

832
01:02:24,919 --> 01:02:28,411
They don't never see their men
only once in long while.

833
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:32,424
You sit and wait all alone...

834
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:35,757
...and when their boys
grow up and go on sea...

835
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:38,524
...they sit and wait some more.

836
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,966
Any girI marry sailor is crazy fool,
I tell you.

837
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:46,869
Your mother, she tell you same thing
if she was alive.

838
01:02:47,042 --> 01:02:49,806
Well, that ain't whyI won't marry him.

839
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:53,004
I'm not thinking about myseIf...

840
01:02:53,181 --> 01:02:55,376
...but about him.

841
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:01,384
He's such a simple guy, a big kid.

842
01:03:02,557 --> 01:03:05,390
AndI haven't got the heart to fooI him.

843
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:10,597
You fooI him? Oh, you go crazy,I think.

844
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:14,394
I've been thinkingI was myseIf
the last few days.

845
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:19,664
I'll be outside.

846
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:22,674
I love to watch the ships passing.

847
01:03:25,613 --> 01:03:28,548
When Matt comes along,
tell him whereI am, will you?

848
01:03:28,717 --> 01:03:31,413
All right,I tell him.

849
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:51,799
Well, God bless who's here.

850
01:03:51,973 --> 01:03:54,703
How's the world treating you
this afternoon, Anna's father?

851
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:57,401
Oh, pretty good, if it ain't for some fellas.

852
01:03:57,579 --> 01:03:59,046
Meaning me, do you?

853
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:01,478
Well, if you ain't
the funny old crank of a man.

854
01:04:01,649 --> 01:04:03,344
Where's herseIf?

855
01:04:05,587 --> 01:04:08,750
-Where's Anna, I'm after asking you.
-She gone out to look on boat.

856
01:04:08,923 --> 01:04:11,050
Well, I'll be going out to her.

857
01:04:11,493 --> 01:04:14,189
But beforeI go, I'll take
this chance while we're alone...

858
01:04:14,362 --> 01:04:18,230
...to have a word with you.
And that word is soon done.

859
01:04:19,334 --> 01:04:21,495
I'm marrying your Anna
before this day is out.

860
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:24,137
You may as well make up
your mind to it, like it or no.

861
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:25,499
That's easy for saying.

862
01:04:25,673 --> 01:04:28,801
You meanI won't? ls it yourseIf
is after stopping me, do you think?

863
01:04:28,977 --> 01:04:33,414
-I stop it if it come to worst.
-Sure, it isn't trouble I'm looking for.

864
01:04:33,581 --> 01:04:37,312
You're her father. Wouldn't it be a shame
for us to be at each others' throats...

865
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:39,885
...like a pair of dogs,
andI married to Anna.

866
01:04:40,054 --> 01:04:44,388
So out with the truth, man alive.
What is it you're holding against me at all?

867
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,357
I don't want my Anna for got married.

868
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:50,464
Listen, you fella. I'm old man.

869
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:55,467
I don't see my Anna for 1 5 year.
She's alll got in the world.

870
01:04:55,637 --> 01:05:00,233
You think now when she come on first trip,
I want her for leave me alone again?

871
01:05:00,408 --> 01:05:04,208
Sure, let you not be thinking I've no heart
at all for the way you'd be feeling.

872
01:05:04,379 --> 01:05:06,711
Then you do right thing, eh?

873
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:10,908
You ship away again
and leave my Anna alone.

874
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:15,454
Say, big fella like you on sea,
he don't need a wife.

875
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:18,217
He got new girI in every port,
you know that.

876
01:05:18,393 --> 01:05:20,384
Oh, shut up.

877
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:23,222
Sure, there's a time come to every man,
on sea or land...

878
01:05:23,398 --> 01:05:27,300
...when he's sick of the lot of them cows,
and wearing his heart out to meet up...

879
01:05:27,469 --> 01:05:29,801
...with some fine, decent girl...

880
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:33,998
...and building a home to call his own,
rearing up children in it.

881
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:36,405
Sure, Anna's the one woman
in the world for me...

882
01:05:36,578 --> 01:05:38,842
...andI can't live without her now,
I'm thinking.

883
01:05:39,013 --> 01:05:42,676
You think I'm going let her life
be made sorry by you...

884
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:45,251
...just like her mother's was made by me?

885
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:51,255
No, she don't marry you.
Not ifI have to kill you first.

886
01:05:51,426 --> 01:05:54,657
Glory be to God, what talk
from a stumpy runt of a man.

887
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:59,357
lt is queer fooI's blather you have, about
the sea done this and the sea done that.

888
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:02,560
You ought to be ashamed to be saying
the like, you an old sailor.

889
01:06:02,737 --> 01:06:05,729
I'm hearing a lot from you,
and a lot more that Anna tells me...

890
01:06:05,907 --> 01:06:09,638
...you do be saying to her. I'm thinking
it is a poor weak thing you are.

891
01:06:09,811 --> 01:06:10,903
Not a man at all.

892
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:13,411
You see if I'm man
maybe quicker than you think.

893
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:17,483
You know the truth in your heart. The sea
hit you a clout once and knocked you down.

894
01:06:17,652 --> 01:06:21,782
You're not man enough to get up for
another, but you lie there howling murder.

895
01:06:21,956 --> 01:06:24,151
I'd like to see you
in the best of your youth.

896
01:06:24,325 --> 01:06:27,988
-Do whatI done in the storm and after.
-Why, you young fool, you.

897
01:06:28,162 --> 01:06:30,153
ln old days,
whenI was on windjammer...

898
01:06:30,331 --> 01:06:32,993
...I went through hundred storms
worse than that.

899
01:06:33,167 --> 01:06:37,570
Ships were ships then,
and men what sailing them reaI men.

900
01:06:37,739 --> 01:06:39,366
What you got on steamers now?

901
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,341
You got fellas on deck don't know
a ship from a mud scow...

902
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:48,107
...and below deck, you got fellas
just know how to shoveI coal.

903
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:51,116
You might as well
work on coaI wagon ashore, you.

904
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:54,687
ls it throwing insults at the men
in the stokehold you are, you old ape?

905
01:06:54,856 --> 01:06:57,882
One of them is worth any 1 0 squareheads
ever shipped on a windbag.

906
01:06:58,059 --> 01:07:02,223
-You lrish swine.
-So you don't like the lrish, you old baboon?

907
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:05,195
Sure, it's that you're needing
in your family. An lrishman.

908
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:07,891
A man of the stokehold
to put guts in it...

909
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:12,403
...so you'll not be rearing up grandchildren
to be jackasses like yourseIf.

910
01:07:21,316 --> 01:07:24,251
Sure, old men getting childish
shouldn't play with knives.

911
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:29,414
Faith, I've haIf a mind to hit you a clout
will put sense in your square head.

912
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:32,416
Keep away from me, now.

913
01:07:41,402 --> 01:07:44,701
Hello, Matt. Are you here already?

914
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,573
Say, what's up? How did that chair
get knocked over?

915
01:07:50,578 --> 01:07:53,843
Oh, Matt, you haven't been fighting
with him, after you promised?

916
01:07:54,015 --> 01:07:55,846
I've not laid a hand on him, Anna.

917
01:07:56,017 --> 01:07:59,714
I told him to his teethI love you.
That's God's truth, and well you know it.

918
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:02,651
He tell same thing
to girI in every port he goes.

919
01:08:03,691 --> 01:08:06,285
I know it's true, Matt.
Don't you mind what he says.

920
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:07,792
God bless you.

921
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:11,193
And thenI saidI thought maybe
you'd have a bit of love for me too.

922
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,593
So you told him that?

923
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:19,072
MaybeI have. I've been wondering
ifI do love you.

924
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,334
I didn't want to,I must own up to that.

925
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:26,742
But l--I guessI can't help it,
soI guessI do.

926
01:08:26,914 --> 01:08:31,214
Oh, sure,I do, Matt. What's the use
of kidding myseIf different?

927
01:08:31,386 --> 01:08:35,049
-Sure,I love you.
-God be praised.

928
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:39,125
AndI haven't ever loved a man
in my life before, never.

929
01:08:39,293 --> 01:08:43,855
Faith, we'll be having a grand, beautiful
life together to the end of our days.

930
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:53,206
Matt.

931
01:09:03,384 --> 01:09:06,547
-Goodbye, Matt.
-Goodbye, is it?

932
01:09:06,721 --> 01:09:09,884
I'll be coming at you in a second
for more of the same.

933
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:12,783
Own up like a man
when you're beat fair and square.

934
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,520
Here's me hand to you.
We'll be friends from this out.

935
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:19,394
No,I don't shake hands with you, fella.
Not whileI live.

936
01:09:19,567 --> 01:09:22,161
The back of me hand to you,
then, if that suits you.

937
01:09:22,336 --> 01:09:24,497
It's a rotten bad loser you are,
deviI mend you.

938
01:09:24,672 --> 01:09:28,164
No,I don't lose.
Anna said she like you little bit.

939
01:09:28,342 --> 01:09:31,209
But you don't hear her say
she marry you,I bet.

940
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:33,939
No, andI don't hear her say
the sun is shining, either.

941
01:09:34,115 --> 01:09:36,515
-No,I didn't say it, Matt.
-There, you hear?

942
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:38,652
You're waiting to be asked, you mean?

943
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,048
Well, I'm asking you now.

944
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:42,382
We'll be wedded this day,
with the help of God.

945
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:45,390
-You heard whatI said afterI kissed you.
-I don't remember.

946
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,189
I said goodbye.
That kiss was for goodbye, Matt.

947
01:09:49,363 --> 01:09:50,591
What do you mean?

948
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:54,394
I can't marry you.
We've said goodbye, that's all.

949
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:57,299
-I knew that was so.
-ls it making game of me you'd be?

950
01:09:57,472 --> 01:10:00,873
It's a queer time to joke with me.
Don't be doing it, for the love of God.

951
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:02,703
You don't think I'd kid you now.

952
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:04,936
I'm not joking, Matt.I mean whatI say.

953
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:07,707
You don't. You can't.
lt is mad you are, I'm telling you.

954
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:10,783
-No, I'm not.
-What's come over you so sudden?

955
01:10:10,952 --> 01:10:12,249
You were saying you love me.

956
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,514
I'll say that as often as you want me to.
It's true.

957
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,215
But why? What? What is it?

958
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,257
Because...

959
01:10:20,428 --> 01:10:23,397
...it's the best wayI can figure out, Matt.

960
01:10:23,564 --> 01:10:29,025
I've been thinking it over and thinking
it over, day and night, all week.

961
01:10:29,203 --> 01:10:31,728
Oh, don't think it isn't hard
on me too, Matt.

962
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:34,601
Well, will you tell me what's preventing
this wedding...

963
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:36,573
...when the two of us has love?

964
01:10:36,811 --> 01:10:39,336
I'm thinking it's listening
to that old fooI you are...

965
01:10:39,514 --> 01:10:42,278
...him hating me, filling your ears
full of lies against me.

966
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,977
Yes, Anna believe me, not you.
She know her old father don't lie like you.

967
01:10:46,587 --> 01:10:49,181
You sit down, do you hear?

968
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:52,383
Why do you come butting in
and making things worse?

969
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,755
You're like a devil, you are.

970
01:10:54,929 --> 01:10:58,262
HereI was, beginning to like you,
beginning to forget all the things...

971
01:10:58,432 --> 01:11:01,924
-...I've held up against you.
-You ain't got nothing for hold against me.

972
01:11:02,103 --> 01:11:05,971
Haven't l, though? Well, let me tell you.

973
01:11:07,408 --> 01:11:09,308
Matt, I'm surprised at you.

974
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:12,605
-You didn't think anything he'd said--
-Sure, what else would it be?

975
01:11:13,748 --> 01:11:15,875
Tell me, and don't keep me waiting.

976
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,348
I can't tell you, andI won't.

977
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:21,352
I've got a good reason,
that's all you need to know.

978
01:11:21,522 --> 01:11:25,014
I can't marry you,
and that's all there is to it.

979
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:28,287
So for heaven's sake,
let's talk of something else.

980
01:11:28,462 --> 01:11:30,225
No, I'll not.

981
01:11:30,398 --> 01:11:33,026
-ls it married to someone else you are?
-I should say not.

982
01:11:45,746 --> 01:11:48,214
You're like them women
can't make up their minds...

983
01:11:48,382 --> 01:11:51,408
...till they're drove to it.
Well, I'll make up your mind for you.

984
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:53,986
We've had enough talk.
Let's go to the other room...

985
01:11:54,155 --> 01:11:56,146
...and dress in your best.
We're going ashore.

986
01:11:56,324 --> 01:11:58,622
-She don't do that.
-Where do you get that stuff?

987
01:11:58,793 --> 01:12:00,488
Never mind,
get on with your dressing.

988
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:02,993
-We'll see who'll win in the end, me or you.
-Stay, Anna.

989
01:12:03,164 --> 01:12:06,463
She will not. She'll do whatI say.
You've had your hold on her long enough.

990
01:12:06,634 --> 01:12:08,795
-It's my turn now.
-Your turn? What amI anyway?

991
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:11,268
Never mind what you are.
It's what you're gonna be:

992
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:13,464
Wedded to me.
Come on with your dressing.

993
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:15,370
-Don't do one thing he say!
-She will!

994
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:17,511
-I'm her father.
-She will in spite of you.

995
01:12:17,678 --> 01:12:19,578
She's taking my orders
from now on, not yours.

996
01:12:19,747 --> 01:12:20,736
Orders is good.

997
01:12:20,915 --> 01:12:22,940
Never mind now.
We've no time to be wasting.

998
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:26,314
-Do you hear what I'm telling you?
-No, stay here, Anna!

999
01:12:26,921 --> 01:12:30,118
You can go to blazes, both of you.

1000
01:12:30,825 --> 01:12:35,194
You'd thinkI was a piece of furniture.
I'll show you. Sit down.

1001
01:12:35,363 --> 01:12:38,298
Sit down, do you hear?
Let me talk for a minute.

1002
01:12:38,466 --> 01:12:40,195
You're all wrong, see?

1003
01:12:40,368 --> 01:12:43,701
I'm gonna tell you two something,
and then I'm gonna beat it.

1004
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:45,862
I've been meaning
to turn it loose on you...

1005
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,406
...every time you get my goat
with your crazy talk...

1006
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:50,441
...about wanting to keep me safe inland.

1007
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:54,103
I wasn't going to tell you,
but you've forced me into it.

1008
01:12:54,282 --> 01:12:56,546
Oh, what's the use?

1009
01:12:56,717 --> 01:13:00,983
It's all wrong anyway. You might as well
get cured this way as any other.

1010
01:13:01,155 --> 01:13:05,319
Don't forget what you said about it not
mattering to you what reasonI got...

1011
01:13:05,493 --> 01:13:07,324
...as long asI wasn't married already.

1012
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:09,326
That's me word, and I'll stick to it.

1013
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:12,796
You make me laugh, honest.
Wanna bet you will?

1014
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:15,162
You wait and see.

1015
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:19,162
You was going on as if
one of you had to own me.

1016
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,276
But nobody owns me, see,
excepting myseIf.

1017
01:13:23,444 --> 01:13:28,108
I'll do whatI please. And no man,
I don't give a darn who he is...

1018
01:13:28,282 --> 01:13:31,911
...can tell me what to do.
I ain't asking either of you for a living.

1019
01:13:32,086 --> 01:13:34,316
I'll make it myseIf, one way or another.

1020
01:13:34,488 --> 01:13:38,754
I am my own boss. Now, put that
in your pipe and smoke it.

1021
01:13:38,926 --> 01:13:42,054
-You and your orders.
-I wasn't meaning it that way at all...

1022
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:43,457
...and well you know it.

1023
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:45,690
You've no call
to raise this rumpus with me.

1024
01:13:45,866 --> 01:13:48,391
-lt is him, you've a right.
-I'm coming to him.

1025
01:13:48,569 --> 01:13:51,504
But you, you did mean it that way.

1026
01:13:51,672 --> 01:13:53,867
You sounded just like all the rest.

1027
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:57,499
lt is queer, rough talk, that,
for a decent girI the like of yourseIf.

1028
01:13:57,678 --> 01:14:01,705
Decent. Who told youI was?

1029
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,347
I'm talking to you now.

1030
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:07,419
I don't want to hear.
You go out your head,I think.

1031
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:10,989
Well, living with you is enough
to drive anyone off their nut.

1032
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:14,286
Your bunk about the farm being so fine.

1033
01:14:14,462 --> 01:14:17,295
Didn'tI write you, year after year,
how rotten it was...

1034
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:20,059
...and what a dirty slave
them cousins made out of me?

1035
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:24,534
What did you care? Nothing. Not even
enough to come out and see me.

1036
01:14:24,705 --> 01:14:28,072
Your crazy stuff about wanting
to keep me away from the sea...

1037
01:14:28,242 --> 01:14:29,470
...don't go down with me.

1038
01:14:29,643 --> 01:14:32,476
You just didn't want
to be bothered with me.

1039
01:14:32,646 --> 01:14:36,377
-Oh, that ain't so, Anna.
-But one thingI never wrote you...

1040
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,815
...it was one of them cousins
that you think is such nice people...

1041
01:14:39,987 --> 01:14:41,750
...that started me wrong.

1042
01:14:41,922 --> 01:14:45,824
And it was none of my fault.
I hated him and he knew it.

1043
01:14:45,993 --> 01:14:50,191
But he was big and strong, like you.

1044
01:14:51,298 --> 01:14:53,232
That's whyI ran away from the farm.

1045
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:56,598
That's what made me get a job
as a nurse girI in St. Paul.

1046
01:14:56,771 --> 01:14:59,604
You think that was a nice job
for a girl, too, don't you?

1047
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:04,973
With all them nice inland fellas
just looking for a chance to marry me.

1048
01:15:05,146 --> 01:15:08,013
They weren't looking for marrying.

1049
01:15:10,351 --> 01:15:12,478
You don't say nothing.

1050
01:15:12,653 --> 01:15:16,487
Either one of you.
ButI know what you're thinking.

1051
01:15:16,657 --> 01:15:19,956
You're just like all the rest.

1052
01:15:21,295 --> 01:15:24,059
And who's to blame for it? Me or you?

1053
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:26,324
If you'd been a regular father
and had me with you...

1054
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,060
-...things would've been different.
-Don't talk that way.

1055
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:33,172
-I go crazy.I won't listen to you.
-You will listen.

1056
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:38,676
You, keeping me safe inland.
I was no nurse girI the last two years.

1057
01:15:38,846 --> 01:15:42,976
I lied whenI wrote you.
I was in a house, that's what.

1058
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,550
Yes, that kind of a house.

1059
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:48,847
The kind that sailors like Matt and you
go to in port...

1060
01:15:49,023 --> 01:15:51,218
...and your nice inland men too.

1061
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:52,654
And all men.

1062
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:54,988
I hate them,I hate them....

1063
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:59,030
-Oh, it's a lie, Anna, it's a lie....
-So...

1064
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,327
...that's what's in it.

1065
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:07,066
I suppose you remember your promise.

1066
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:11,678
No other reason was to count with you
as long asI wasn't married already.

1067
01:16:11,846 --> 01:16:15,145
You want me to get dressed
and go ashore, don't you?

1068
01:16:15,316 --> 01:16:18,513
Oh, yes, you do.

1069
01:16:21,555 --> 01:16:26,754
I suppose ifI tried to tell you
thatI wasn't that no more...

1070
01:16:26,927 --> 01:16:29,054
...you'd believe me, wouldn't you?

1071
01:16:29,296 --> 01:16:33,289
And ifI told you that just getting out
on this barge and being on the sea...

1072
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:36,231
...had changed me and made me
feeI different about things...

1073
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:40,301
...as if all that I've been through
wasn't me, didn't count...

1074
01:16:40,474 --> 01:16:42,635
...it was just like it never happened...

1075
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,971
...you'd laugh, wouldn't you?

1076
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:50,140
And you'd die laughing,
I'm sure, ifI told you...

1077
01:16:50,317 --> 01:16:54,083
...that meeting you that funny way
that night in the fog...

1078
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:58,214
...and afterwards, seeing that you were
straight good stuck on me...

1079
01:16:58,392 --> 01:17:02,328
...had got me to thinking
for the first time in my life.

1080
01:17:02,496 --> 01:17:08,435
AndI sized you up as different from
the ones on land, as water is from mud.

1081
01:17:09,136 --> 01:17:12,833
I couldn't marry you
with you believing a lie.

1082
01:17:13,007 --> 01:17:16,443
AndI was ashamed to tell you the truth.

1083
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,381
And now, give me
a bawling-out and beat it...

1084
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,246
...likeI can tell you're going to.

1085
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:31,684
Will you believe it...

1086
01:17:31,859 --> 01:17:37,661
...ifI tell you that loving you
has made me clean?

1087
01:17:37,831 --> 01:17:41,790
It's straight goods, honest.

1088
01:17:43,771 --> 01:17:48,708
Oh, yes, you will.
You're just like all the rest.

1089
01:17:48,876 --> 01:17:50,468
The rest, is it?

1090
01:17:50,644 --> 01:17:53,238
My curse on you. Clean, is it?

1091
01:17:53,414 --> 01:17:58,113
Oh, don't, Matt. Get out of here.
Let me alone. Get out of here!

1092
01:17:58,285 --> 01:18:00,845
I'll be going. And I'll be
drinking slews of whiskey...

1093
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:03,581
...so to wash that
black kiss of yours off me lips!

1094
01:18:03,757 --> 01:18:07,090
And I'd be getting dead, rotten drunk
so I'll not remember you at all!

1095
01:18:07,261 --> 01:18:10,822
I'll ship away on a boat to the end of the
world, where I'll never see your face again!

1096
01:18:10,998 --> 01:18:14,695
-Oh, don't go. It's better Anna marry you--
-Let go of me, you old ape!

1097
01:18:14,868 --> 01:18:17,735
Marry her, is it?
I'd see her dead at me feet first.

1098
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:20,032
I'm shipping away out of this,
I'm telling you.

1099
01:18:20,207 --> 01:18:23,574
My curse on you,
and the curse of all the saints.

1100
01:18:24,345 --> 01:18:27,781
-I go ashore too.
-Not after him,I tell you.

1101
01:18:27,948 --> 01:18:29,347
Don't you dare.

1102
01:18:29,516 --> 01:18:32,485
Oh,I go for get drink.

1103
01:18:33,153 --> 01:18:35,781
I'm driving you to drink too, huh?

1104
01:18:35,956 --> 01:18:39,255
You wanna get drunk
so you can forget, like him.

1105
01:18:39,426 --> 01:18:44,386
Aye. You thinkI like hear
them things? Oh, Anna.

1106
01:18:44,565 --> 01:18:48,831
Anna,I think you wasn't that kind of girl.

1107
01:18:49,003 --> 01:18:51,301
You want me to beat it, don't you?

1108
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:53,940
You don't want me here
disgracing you,I suppose.

1109
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:59,478
Oh, no, no, Anna. You stay here.
lt ain't your fault,I know that.

1110
01:18:59,647 --> 01:19:02,775
It's that old deviI do this to me.

1111
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:06,716
lt was all right on barge,
with just you and me.

1112
01:19:06,887 --> 01:19:10,050
Then she bring that lrish fellow in fog.

1113
01:19:10,224 --> 01:19:12,954
That fella, he don't
never come, you don't...

1114
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:15,459
...never tell me them things.

1115
01:19:15,629 --> 01:19:18,063
I don't never know.

1116
01:19:18,232 --> 01:19:20,894
Then everything is all right.

1117
01:19:21,068 --> 01:19:24,697
Oh, that dirty deviI sea.

1118
01:19:24,872 --> 01:19:27,397
Oh, what's the use?

1119
01:19:27,574 --> 01:19:29,769
Go ashore and get drunk.

1120
01:19:29,943 --> 01:19:31,706
You wait here, Anna?

1121
01:19:31,879 --> 01:19:35,474
Maybe. Maybe not.

1122
01:19:35,783 --> 01:19:38,980
Maybe I'll get drunk too. Maybe I'll....

1123
01:19:39,153 --> 01:19:43,783
0h, what do you care whatI do?
Go on and beat it.

1124
01:20:22,529 --> 01:20:25,362
It's foggy outside.

1125
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,165
Oh, God.

1126
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:41,806
-What's the trouble? Feeling sick?
-lnside my head feels sick.

1127
01:20:45,386 --> 01:20:50,050
Oh, Anna, you think maybe sometime
you forgive me, Anna?

1128
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:53,887
-I'll forgive you right now.
-Oh, Anna lilla.

1129
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:59,124
Oh, don't bawI about it.
There ain't nothing to forgive anyway.

1130
01:20:59,299 --> 01:21:03,497
lt ain't your fault, it ain't mine.
lt ain't his, neither.

1131
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:08,004
I fix everything all right
for you and me, Anna.

1132
01:21:08,175 --> 01:21:10,006
Yes?

1133
01:21:10,177 --> 01:21:12,702
Then you and me will stick together?

1134
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,872
We'll work for each other
and help each other, huh?

1135
01:21:16,049 --> 01:21:21,783
-What is it you fixed?
-Well,I sign on steamer Londonderry.

1136
01:21:21,955 --> 01:21:24,788
SaiI for Cape Town tomorrow.

1137
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:29,452
Oh, Anna,I only bring you bad luck.

1138
01:21:30,964 --> 01:21:33,364
That's how you fix me, is it?

1139
01:21:33,534 --> 01:21:37,026
Well,I think that old deviI get me back...

1140
01:21:37,204 --> 01:21:40,037
...maybe she leave you alone, then.

1141
01:21:41,408 --> 01:21:47,438
Oh, can't you see that you're doing
the same thing that you've always done?

1142
01:21:47,614 --> 01:21:50,242
Can't you see that?

1143
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:53,853
Oh, what's the use of talking?

1144
01:21:54,021 --> 01:21:58,754
You ain't right.
I'll never blame you anymore.

1145
01:21:58,926 --> 01:22:00,723
Oh, Anna.

1146
01:22:00,894 --> 01:22:03,829
You forgive me, sure?

1147
01:22:04,865 --> 01:22:07,959
SurelyI do. You ain't to blame.

1148
01:22:08,135 --> 01:22:10,763
You're just what you are, like me.

1149
01:22:10,938 --> 01:22:14,999
And you, you let me
kiss you once again, eh?

1150
01:22:15,175 --> 01:22:20,613
-Oh, sure, no hard feelings.
-Oh, Anna lilla.

1151
01:22:22,216 --> 01:22:24,946
I can't say it, Anna.

1152
01:22:25,118 --> 01:22:28,679
I thinkI go lie down, go to sleep.

1153
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:32,849
Oh, that booze, he don't go well, Anna.

1154
01:22:33,026 --> 01:22:36,962
I think I'm never going to drink again.

1155
01:23:03,624 --> 01:23:06,616
I can't stand this much longer.

1156
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:11,389
What amI waiting for, anyhow,
like a darn fool?

1157
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,480
Anna?

1158
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:41,423
-Anna?
-Yes, what do you want?

1159
01:23:42,796 --> 01:23:45,731
Don't say it.I know what's in your mind.

1160
01:23:45,899 --> 01:23:48,993
Yes, that's whatI was,
and that's what I'm going back to.

1161
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:51,637
I'd kill you first. And finish it up.

1162
01:23:51,805 --> 01:23:54,706
It's a dog's lifeI been living
sinceI found out what you are.

1163
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:58,038
Oh, why don't you leave me alone.
Go away.

1164
01:23:58,211 --> 01:24:01,237
Don't you see I'm licked? What do you
want to keep kicking me for?

1165
01:24:01,415 --> 01:24:03,747
Don't you deserve the worst I'd say,
God forgive you?

1166
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:07,216
All right, maybeI do. But don't rub it in.

1167
01:24:07,387 --> 01:24:09,685
Why haven't you done
what you said you were going to?

1168
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,984
Ship away to the other side of the earth,
where you don't have to see me.

1169
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,129
-I have.
-What?

1170
01:24:16,997 --> 01:24:18,430
You're going away, honest?

1171
01:24:18,599 --> 01:24:22,194
I signed on, drunk asI was,
and she's sailing tomorrow.

1172
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:26,465
-Where is she going? Far away?
-Cape Town. lt is at the end of Africa.

1173
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,039
That's far for you.

1174
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:31,200
-What's the boat's name?
-The Londonderry.

1175
01:24:31,378 --> 01:24:33,676
The Londonderry?

1176
01:24:35,015 --> 01:24:37,677
Oh, this is too much.

1177
01:24:38,585 --> 01:24:40,883
Faith,I don't blame you
for laughing at me.

1178
01:24:41,054 --> 01:24:44,182
True, it is the fooI of the worldI am
to come back to talk to you at all.

1179
01:24:44,358 --> 01:24:49,523
Oh, what's the use? What's the use of
me talking? What's the use of anything?

1180
01:24:49,696 --> 01:24:51,323
Anna....

1181
01:24:51,498 --> 01:24:54,729
Anna, ifI could only be believing
I was the only man in the world...

1182
01:24:54,901 --> 01:24:58,962
...ever you had love for,
I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.

1183
01:24:59,139 --> 01:25:02,165
Are you trying to accuse me
of being in love...

1184
01:25:02,342 --> 01:25:04,435
...really in love, with them?

1185
01:25:04,611 --> 01:25:08,377
You fool, you.
I've stood enough from you.

1186
01:25:08,548 --> 01:25:11,779
Love them, is it?I hated them,I tell you.

1187
01:25:11,952 --> 01:25:15,285
And may God strike me dead,
and my mother too, if she was alive...

1188
01:25:15,455 --> 01:25:17,446
...if I'm not telling you the honest truth.

1189
01:25:17,624 --> 01:25:21,219
Oh, sure, Anna, ifI could only
be believing you, now.

1190
01:25:21,395 --> 01:25:24,330
Why, Matt, you've got to believe it.

1191
01:25:24,498 --> 01:25:28,366
What canI do? What willl do
to prove to you I'm not lying?

1192
01:25:28,535 --> 01:25:33,131
Anna, would you--? Would you be willing
to swear an oath, a terrible, fearfuI oath?

1193
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:35,740
Oh, sure,I will, Matt, on anything.

1194
01:25:35,909 --> 01:25:37,809
Would you swear on this?

1195
01:25:37,978 --> 01:25:39,445
Oh, sure. Give it to me.

1196
01:25:39,613 --> 01:25:42,605
lt is a cross given to me by me mother,
God rest her soul.

1197
01:25:42,783 --> 01:25:44,944
And I'm telling you,
it has great power in it.

1198
01:25:45,118 --> 01:25:47,848
And I'm warning you now,
if you swear on this...

1199
01:25:48,021 --> 01:25:51,286
...it is me old woman herseIf who'd
be looking down on you from heaven...

1200
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:55,052
...and praying the saints to put a curse
on you if she hears you swear a lie.

1201
01:25:55,228 --> 01:25:58,629
I wouldn't have the nerve,
honest, Matt, if it was a lie.

1202
01:25:58,799 --> 01:26:01,768
But it's the truth,
andI ain't scared to swear it.

1203
01:26:01,935 --> 01:26:06,031
Give it to me. What do you
want me to swear? You say it.

1204
01:26:06,206 --> 01:26:08,902
Swear I'm the only man in the world
ever you felt love for.

1205
01:26:09,076 --> 01:26:13,069
I swear it.I swear it by God.

1206
01:26:13,246 --> 01:26:16,215
And may the blackest curse of God
strike you if you're lying.

1207
01:26:16,383 --> 01:26:19,477
And may the blackest curse of God
strike me if I'm lying.

1208
01:26:19,653 --> 01:26:22,781
Oh, glory be to God,
I'm after believing you now.

1209
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:27,655
-Now what's the matter?
-ls it Catholic you are?

1210
01:26:27,828 --> 01:26:30,695
-No, why?
-Oh, God pity me.

1211
01:26:30,864 --> 01:26:32,991
Sure, it's some deviI's treachery in it.

1212
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:35,999
You swearing on a Catholic cross,
and you one of the others.

1213
01:26:36,169 --> 01:26:39,832
-Well, don't you believe me, Matt?
-Oh, but if it ain't a Catholic you are....

1214
01:26:40,006 --> 01:26:42,440
I ain't nothing, Matt.
What's the difference?

1215
01:26:42,609 --> 01:26:43,940
Didn't you hear me swear?

1216
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:46,841
I'm afraidI love you, God forgive me,
no matter what you are.

1217
01:26:47,013 --> 01:26:49,447
I'd be going mad if I'd not be having you.

1218
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,581
I'd be killing the world.
We'll be wedded this day.

1219
01:26:51,752 --> 01:26:54,312
And we'll be happy, the two of us,
in spite of the devil.

1220
01:26:54,488 --> 01:26:57,423
Well, we gotta have a drink on this,
my good man.

1221
01:26:57,591 --> 01:27:00,151
-Blast you.
-That's the way to talk.

1222
01:27:00,327 --> 01:27:03,592
Oh, Matt, it's time for you two
to kiss and make up.

1223
01:27:03,764 --> 01:27:06,062
You'll be shipmates
on the Londonderry, you know.

1224
01:27:06,233 --> 01:27:10,067
-Shipmates? Has himseIf--?
-Aye, and I'm boatswain on her.

1225
01:27:10,237 --> 01:27:11,932
The devil!

1226
01:27:12,105 --> 01:27:15,268
You'd be shipping away to sea
and leaving her alone again, will you?

1227
01:27:15,442 --> 01:27:18,570
It's all right, Matt. That's where
he belongs, andI want him to go.

1228
01:27:18,745 --> 01:27:20,736
You've gotta go too.
We'll need the money.

1229
01:27:20,914 --> 01:27:23,815
And as for me being alone, why,
that runs in the family...

1230
01:27:23,984 --> 01:27:25,747
...and I'll get used to it.

1231
01:27:25,919 --> 01:27:31,755
I'll get a house somewhere and I'll make
a regular place for you two to come back.

1232
01:27:31,925 --> 01:27:36,259
And now you'll drink
and be friends, huh?

1233
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,125
Sure.

1234
01:27:39,299 --> 01:27:41,961
-Here's luck to you.
-Skoal.

1235
01:27:49,876 --> 01:27:53,209
Well, you'll not be lonesome long.
I'll see to that, God willing.

1236
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:56,713
Sure as himseIf will be having
a grandchild riding his foot,I tell you.

1237
01:27:56,883 --> 01:28:00,683
-Maybe twins.
-Oh, quit your kidding.

1238
01:28:00,854 --> 01:28:03,516
ls it any religion at all you have,
you and your Anna?

1239
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:06,250
Well, in the old country,
we was Lutherans.

1240
01:28:06,426 --> 01:28:08,053
Lutherans, is it?

1241
01:28:08,228 --> 01:28:11,391
Oh, then I'm damned entirely.

1242
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,398
Oh, well, what's the difference?

1243
01:28:14,568 --> 01:28:16,399
lt is God's will anyhow.

1244
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:21,564
It's queer, you and me
shipping on same boat that way.

1245
01:28:21,741 --> 01:28:23,208
That ain't right.

1246
01:28:23,376 --> 01:28:29,315
It's that funny way old deviI sea
do her worst dirty tricks.

1247
01:28:29,482 --> 01:28:30,744
Aye, is so.

1248
01:28:31,618 --> 01:28:35,076
Faith, I'm afraid you've the right of it
for once, deviI take you.

1249
01:28:35,255 --> 01:28:39,521
Why, gee, Matt, you ain't
agreeing with him, are you?

1250
01:28:41,127 --> 01:28:44,995
Come on. Here's to the sea,
no matter what.

1251
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:48,690
Be a game sport, man. Drink to that.

1252
01:28:52,305 --> 01:28:56,639
Fog, fog all time.

1253
01:28:56,877 --> 01:29:00,176
You can't tell where you was going.

1254
01:29:01,481 --> 01:29:05,679
Only that old deviI sea.

1255
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,354
She knows.

1256
01:29:22,936 --> 01:29:24,927
