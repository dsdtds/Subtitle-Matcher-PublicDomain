1
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,417
What a beautiful old man.

2
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:00,857
What a lovely head.

3
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:03,024
India is filled with old men, memsahib.

4
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,058
But not like the one in the yellow turban.

5
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,229
He's like a head of John the Baptist.

6
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,792
The memsahib refers to the storyteller?

7
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:17,677
Are these silent monsters
at peace with us?

8
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:21,062
It is but a truce they keep with man.

9
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:25,620
But I, who have seen their tusks
stained red with blood...

10
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:29,714
I could tell you a tale of the silent ones.

11
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:33,366
For a few coppers? Eh?

12
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:38,539
Yea, for a bowl of rice?

13
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,442
What would you do with my image,
memsahib?

14
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:44,378
I would keep it...
for a memory of India.

15
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:48,284
Verily, you would have
all India in your picture.

16
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:53,619
Nay, you would have the book
Of the jungle to read in my eyes.

17
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,309
In the beginning, you must think
Of nothing but silence...

18
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:11,492
a silence so vast that the ear can hear it.

19
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,927
Great trees like the pillars of the temple...

20
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,902
with ferns like green
carpets underneath.

21
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:28,004
While above, under the dome of heaven
Where lived the winged ones...

22
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:33,783
the wind moves restlessly,
Whistling across the roof of the world.

23
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:37,785
These are the eaters of grass
In a world of torn flesh.

24
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:42,524
Early the little fawns
Must learn their lesson...

25
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,030
feet that make no noise,
eyes that see in the dark...

26
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:51,035
ears that hear the leopard leaving his lair.

27
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:07,510
For the leopard lives by the law
Of claw and horn and fang...

28
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,461
He will kill for hunger and eat thereof...

29
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:12,897
but he will never kill fork killing's sake ...

30
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:17,435
a law all men break.
but the jungle folk obey.

31
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:54,601
These are the lords of the jungle.

32
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,893
The tribe of Hathi, the silent ones.

33
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:03,341
They go their way, eaters of grass
In a world of carnage.

34
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:23,993
For the wolves are the true
hunters of the jungle.

35
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:27,597
And like huntsmen,
They stick to their Clan...

36
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:32,224
with a strict regard
For hunting Calls and tribal law.

37
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:36,409
Free Companions of the woods, they may
Fight and quarrel amongst themselves...

38
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,379
until the strongest of them wins
The leadership of the pack.

39
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:59,039
Yet jungle folk say...

40
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:03,312
the wisest amongst them
is the tribe of Baloo, the bear.

41
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,490
He is a teacher of the jungle law.

42
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,189
Yet there is one who knows law...

43
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:20,525
the barrel-bodied mugger,
the Crocodile...

44
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:25,694
with his chin in the shallows
And lust in his cold heart...

45
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:31,384
hoping to drag down to the depths
All who wander along his river bank.

46
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,737
And in the legends of the jungle
There is a black prince...

47
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:50,831
shrewdest of the lords of claw,
Horn and fang...

48
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:55,616
As bold as a buffalo,
as reckless as a wounded elephant...

49
00:06:55,721 --> 00:07:00,508
with a voice as soft as wild honey
Dripping from a tree.

50
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:03,528
Unbridled, unmastered, unafraid.

51
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,199
Bagrheera the black panther.

52
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:11,704
And now...

53
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:15,409
Behold, the villain of my tale.

54
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,579
The killer, the man-eater...

55
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:22,051
the assassin who first brought murder
to the jungle Clans.

56
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:24,459
Shere Khan, the tiger.

57
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,798
It is said that in his first kill...

58
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,868
when he was Cain to some
Poor Abel of the glades...

59
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:37,205
when he ran from the scene of his crime...

60
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:40,009
the trees and creepers
Whipped him with their branches...

61
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:43,847
and striped his yellow hide
with the mark of Cain.

62
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:52,525
This evil lord must have his dish-lickers...

63
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,631
his bullies for attendants.

64
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,903
Tabaqui the jackal.

65
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:05,146
And the hyena...

66
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:09,936
hungry for the scraps
Of their murderous master's feast.

67
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,291
But my tale is not alone
Of outcasts and heroes.

68
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:21,205
I will tell you also of the snake, Kaa,
the wise one...

69
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:25,236
the oracle who taught Mother Eve
The speech men use...

70
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,310
for trickery and sin.

71
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:33,453
What is the book of life itself
but man's war with nature...

72
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:37,653
the struggle between village and jungle,

73
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:46,365
Under the mantle of wild creepers
And great trees...

74
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:50,036
many a ruined City lies forgotten
in the pages of time.

75
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:55,110
Yea, where a thousand war Chariots
Proclaimed the might of a great king...

76
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:58,583
before whom all men bowed their heads.

77
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:03,329
Nothing remains but a trellis
For wild figs to sun upon.

78
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,800
But what of the great maharaja,
The loser in this battle?

79
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:16,972
He has left many such a palace
To his Cousins, the monkey folk.

80
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:18,707
The bandar-logs

81
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,813
The outcasts of the jungle.

82
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:34,672
First you must picture me
as I was, milords...

83
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:38,102
Buldeo, the mighty hunter.

84
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:41,742
It was a long time ago...

85
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:44,743
and very far away...

86
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:48,893
on a summer's evening
in the Seeonee hills.

87
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:52,968
Ajao. Ajao.

88
00:09:57,732 --> 00:10:00,431
Again some palaver.
Its Buldeo, master.

89
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:03,234
That fool would make speeches
the whole day.

90
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,073
Come, Durga. Let, s listen to him.

91
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,108
Ajao.

92
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,719
You cannot build your houses
just anywhere.

93
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,357
We have to plan out our village.

94
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:22,593
Someday there will be a mighty city here.

95
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,568
A mighty city with marble houses.

96
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:30,738
The temple shall be there,
facing the marketplace.

97
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,707
That's where I wanted the bean patch.

98
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:36,078
No that's for the marketplace,
as Buldeo says.

99
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:38,916
And the barbershop will face the temple.

100
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,819
I shall find someplace
for the bean patches anyway-...

101
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,755
outside your mighty city.

102
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:48,028
Go Durga. Take the child
and the old man to the cart.

103
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,002
Nathoo.

104
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:56,874
Come Grandfather.

105
00:10:58,212 --> 00:10:59,710
Did you hear that?

106
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:04,417
We're going to have a marketplace
and a temple and a mighty city.

107
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:07,453
Aye we'll have all that
If we can beat the jungle.

108
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,428
But have you and your hundred years
seen man win a war with nature?

109
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:15,532
Sit here Grandfather.

110
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:25,746
There Nathoo.

111
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,282
Now.

112
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,390
Go back to your work.

113
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:52,013
Nathoo?

114
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,816
Where are you my baby?

115
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:02,926
Rao. Look. Our little Nathoo,
he has wandered away.

116
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,699
Now don't worry Messua.
The child couldn't go far.

117
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,803
I'll look for him right away.
Durga you search in there.

118
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,075
Nathoo.

119
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,040
Nathoo.

120
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:22,755
- Nathoo.
- Nathoo.

121
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,727
Nathoo.

122
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:27,995
Nat...

123
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:41,881
Buldeo.

124
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:46,021
Tiger. My husband.

125
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,254
Rao.

126
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,923
Abdullah. Singh.

127
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,561
Abdullah. Ali. Mohammed. Singh.

128
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:54,665
Tiger.

129
00:12:57,406 --> 00:13:00,073
No.

130
00:13:00,075 --> 00:13:03,077
No.

131
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:21,467
Poor master.

132
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:23,738
Poor Messua.

133
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,672
Let us all go and look for the child.

134
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,778
All men bring your spears.

135
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:33,216
Ali Singh Abdullah. Torches.

136
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,192
Follow me.

137
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:44,701
Nathoo.

138
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:47,704
Nathoo.

139
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:01,657
Nathoo.

140
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:04,659
Nathoo.

141
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:07,462
Poor little baby. Poor little Nathoo.

142
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,132
- And that poor mother.
- Poor mother

143
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:13,871
Is it every woman who can have
a wolf nurse her baby for her?

144
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:16,040
Do you believe that Subahdar?

145
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,876
Oh yes memsahib.

146
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,446
And His Excellency your father,
has many records...

147
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,216
of wolf children from the Indian hills.

148
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,822
- It is true.
- True?

149
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,354
In the beginning was it not written...

150
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,558
that the she-wolves
loved the children of man?

151
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:35,161
Were not the wolves the foster parents
Of many a child in India?

152
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:38,171
Little naked and bold...

153
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:41,632
the man's Cub entered the wolves' Cave.

154
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,627
Ahai.

155
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:59,037
He felt just as much at home with the cubs
as at his mother's side.

156
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,403
Nathoo.

157
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,405
Nathoo.

158
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:33,445
Nathoo.

159
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,704
Lost and tired,

160
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:43,797
he fell asleep among his
brothers of the jungle.

161
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:51,988
Akkela the father wolf,
And Rakksha the mother wolf...

162
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:56,841
knew that Shere Khan is prowling outside
Looking for the man Cub.

163
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:01,474
So they took him into their family.

164
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,799
Nathoo.

165
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,502
He grew up with the cubs.
They called him Mowgli-- the Little Frog.

166
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:21,341
Father wolf taught him his business
until every rustle in the grass...

167
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:24,345
meant just as much to him
as to his brothers the wolf cubs.

168
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,883
All the lords of the jungle
became his friends.

169
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,889
He had only one enemy-
Shere Khan the tiger.

170
00:16:32,296 --> 00:16:33,827
Did Mowgli live to hunt Shere Khan?

171
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:38,631
Did he live? Oh.
But had I known then what I know now.

172
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,805
Twelve years had passed...

173
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:46,077
and Shere Khan was on the trail
Of the wolf boy.

Wait. Wait.

193
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,007
Let me handle him.

194
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,527
Buldeo. Buldeo.

195
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:57,764
Ow. He bit me.

196
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,633
He is a wild boy.

197
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,203
Cover him up. Cover him up.

198
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:08,548
Who are you boy?

199
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:11,222
Can't you hear?

200
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,665
Give me a torch. A torch.

201
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,872
Give me that torch.

202
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,043
This boy has never seen fire before.
He's from the jungle.

203
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,413
Yes he is a wild boy.

204
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:31,617
We must be kind to him. Release him.

205
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,990
Release him?

206
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:36,194
Are you mad?

207
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,961
This is a thing of the jungle.

208
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,531
Let me look. Let me look.

209
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:44,094
Look at the scars on his arms and legs.

210
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:49,778
Those points on his bones--
He has run on all fours... with wolf cubs.

211
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,315
Poor child.

212
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,587
This boy has been reared in the jungle.

213
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,424
He has the evil eye.

214
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,861
I begin to think he has.

215
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:00,929
Moonshine.

216
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:06,439
I think this boy is Messua's little baby
which was stolen that day we built the wall.

217
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:09,544
Could this boy be your's Messua?

218
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,821
No. He's not mine.

219
00:23:13,822 --> 00:23:17,723
But he's a handsome boy.
Eyes like red fire.

220
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,484
Any woman would like to have
a son like him.

221
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:24,703
But my Nathoo was soft and plump.

222
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:27,537
But, mistress, how could he be plump
running naked in the woods?

223
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:30,835
I warn you all. He has the evil eye.

224
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:33,647
No, Buldeo.

225
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:37,120
He is some poor, lost lad--
though not my own.

226
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:40,858
But I am a lonely woman,
and if you would let me...

227
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,363
I will shelter him for some other woman
who has lost her son.

228
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:47,403
He is a wolf.
Let one in, and all will follow.

229
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:50,741
He will bring down the jungle upon us.

230
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:54,313
What the jungle has taken,
The jungle has restored, Buldeo.

231
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,586
Aye. Aye.

232
00:23:56,587 --> 00:23:58,886
Take this boy into thy house my sister.

233
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,059
And out of your little hoard of money,
forget not to honor me...

234
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,063
for I have saved his life on this day.

235
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,769
- Release him.
- Wait.

236
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,179
Are you going to turn this devil loose
before I can protect you?

237
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:14,878
A gun.

238
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,480
- Buldeo--
- Don't...

239
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:19,354
A gun.

240
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,592
Buldeo.

241
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,891
Now release him.

242
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:28,266
No.

243
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,835
No.

244
00:24:29,939 --> 00:24:32,642
Boy.

245
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:34,912
Boy.

246
00:24:34,914 --> 00:24:37,717
Will you come with me?

247
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:39,684
Come.

248
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:46,495
Oh. It's, it's all right.

249
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:50,667
Come on.

250
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:52,603
Come along. Come.

251
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,640
Come.

252
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:59,179
It's all right. Come along. Come.
It's all right.

253
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,462
Down upon our heads
even before the temple...

254
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,297
we have called the curse of the beast.

255
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,035
No more shall we prosper.

256
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,240
The wild pig will trample down our vines.

257
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:24,243
The tiger will stalk our streets.

258
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,282
We have opened our doors to the devil.

259
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:33,326
Don't look upon evil.

260
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:36,328
Mahala. Get home to bed.

261
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,627
At least I can keep my own daughter
from harm.

262
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:12,649
Get back, Kpota.

263
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,186
Is that anyway to treat
one who has come to live with us?

264
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:53,881
I remember the day I gave
the first little shoes to my Nathoo.

265
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,309
Wolf-- Uh, wolf boy.

266
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,944
Uh...

267
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:19,249
Oh, those feet have never worn shoes.

268
00:27:19,354 --> 00:27:22,354
No, you are not my son.

269
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:26,338
But you look very much like my son Nathoo.

270
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:32,369
Nathoo called me 'Mother'.

271
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,614
'Mother'.,

272
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,320
'Mother'.,

273
00:27:48,998 --> 00:27:51,533
M-- Mother.

274
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:52,998
Uhh.

275
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,295
And what did the wolves... call you?

276
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:04,417
Wolves.

277
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,620
M...

278
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,260
Mowgli.

279
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:33,725
Mowgli?

280
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,128
A little frog?

281
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:39,535
Yes, you were like a little frog to them,
the beasts of the jungle.

282
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,186
And so you are Mowgli to me.

283
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,014
Come.

284
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Come on.

285
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,730
For months and months after that night...

286
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:03,404
Mowgli was busy learning the ways,
Language and customs of men.

287
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,148
What are you doing?

288
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:57,652
You are like a little panther.

289
00:29:57,758 --> 00:29:59,755
I thought someone had found
the hiding place.

290
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:01,490
- Hiding place?
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:30:01,596 --> 00:30:03,798
- What is this?
- Money.

292
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,107
What is it for?

293
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,167
What is money for?
To protect us from hunger and cold.

294
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:10,836
It lives in a hole like a cobra?

295
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,404
No.

296
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:16,677
If we need a bag of rice, I give these
to the merchant in the square.

297
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,245
He gives us the rice.

298
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,915
- What a fool that merchant must be.
- No.

299
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:23,451
Will the Man-Pack give us
anything for this?

300
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:24,520
Yes.

301
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,160
Will Buldeo give me a tooth?

302
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:29,259
Tooth? You have all your teeth.

303
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:31,966
No. A -A sharp tooth.

304
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:33,265
Oh, a knife?

305
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,093
Yes. A knife tooth, like a tiger's knife.

306
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,105
What need have you for a knife?

307
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,142
To sink it in the throat of my enemy.

308
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:44,781
Your enemy? Ha. You talk about
Akela, the father wolf...

309
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,871
and Raksha, the
Mother wolf, and how much...

310
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:49,053
better it is in the jungle
with all your friends.

311
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:52,059
Now who could be your enemy?

312
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:55,062
Shere Khan, the tiger.

313
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,066
Tell Buldeo to sell you a knife.
Give him the money.

314
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:02,171
I shall have a tooth.

315
00:31:02,341 --> 00:31:05,710
I shall have a tooth.

316
00:31:29,711 --> 00:31:33,346
My father says I mustn't speak to you.

317
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:36,080
What happened to him?

318
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,187
My father shot him.

319
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:46,329
We missed you six moons ago.

320
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,097
He was Baloo's cousin.

321
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,367
He had no man for an enemy.

322
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:54,471
But my father kills every bear he sees.

323
00:31:54,575 --> 00:31:56,006
Why?

324
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,310
Because he is a great hunter.

325
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,914
He kills them even when he's not hungry?

326
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,183
Hungry? We don't eat bears.

327
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,119
Then why did he bring him here?

328
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,425
To show how brave he is.

329
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:11,505
And my father was very brave
to kill that tiger.

330
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,265
That old tiger?

331
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,133
He lived on lizards and rats.

332
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:19,905
He was too old to hunt rabbits.
He must have died in his sleep.

333
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:23,344
I see. You could kill the bear
and the tiger with one shot.

334
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:26,448
I kill Baloo's cousin?
I've gone fishing with him.

335
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:30,418
Fishing with a bear?
How can a bear bait a fishhook?

336
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,859
He looks in the river,
he sees the fish he wants, then who.

337
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:37,964
He knocks it out.

338
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:48,209
Didn't I tell you not to speak
with this thing?

339
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,083
I told Messua to keep you
away from this house.

340
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:57,201
Messua sent me here to talk to you.

341
00:32:57,326 --> 00:32:59,023
She sent me to get a tooth.

342
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,425
A tooth?

343
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,862
Yes. This is the tooth I want.

344
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:05,031
Put that knife down
before I send a shot through you.

345
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:08,069
And then you would put my head
on the wall...

346
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:11,174
like the old Khan there.

347
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:14,911
But I would spring as I die
and give this tooth back to you.

348
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:17,684
Now, now.

349
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:20,686
You're not in the jungle, boy.

350
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:22,354
No.

351
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,991
No, I am not in the jungle, Buldeo.

352
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:28,096
I am with the Man-Pack,
but I am not a man.

353
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,564
What are you, boy?

354
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:33,747
I was until now a cub.
But now I have my tooth.

355
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,685
I can run with the jungle as I please.
I am a wolf.

356
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:43,050
If you had a knife...

357
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:46,501
would you go back to the jungle?

358
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,461
The knife is yours for two annas.

359
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,900
Messua gave me three.

360
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:57,902
One, two, three.

361
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,704
There. Three is more than two.

362
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,810
Yes. More than two.

363
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:07,248
Now get out of my house.

364
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:21,065
See, Shere Khan?

365
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:25,159
- 'Tis for you-- deep in your throat.
- Mowgli.

366
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,512
Won't you be afraid
to go back to the jungle?

367
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:34,552
Afraid of the jungle? Why?

368
00:34:34,554 --> 00:34:38,100
I'm of the wolf pack.
They are my friends.

369
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:40,857
Then why did you buy the knife?

370
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:43,665
For Shere Khan, the tiger.

371
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,429
This is for him.

372
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:48,237
He drove me out of the jungle.

373
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:50,740
He went away far off...

374
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:53,874
but he swore he would lay my bones
in the river when he returned.

375
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,313
I also made a little promise.

376
00:34:57,418 --> 00:35:00,551
I have told the wolves I would kill him.

377
00:35:00,655 --> 00:35:04,589
You can speak their tongue?
You can speak to animals?

378
00:35:04,694 --> 00:35:07,258
Can you talk to Rama, the great herd bull?

379
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:09,261
Rama is a dumb slave.

380
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:11,897
He has been with the Man-Pack so long...

381
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:14,638
he cannot talk to anyone.

382
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,337
Can you speak to him?

383
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:47,546
What did he say?

384
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,682
Don't you know what the monkey people
always say?

385
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:55,090
'We, the monkey people,
are the greatest folk in all the jungle.

386
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:59,729
We know this is true
because we always say it is true.

387
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:03,567
Mowgli, will you let me
Hear you talk to the wolves?

388
00:36:03,671 --> 00:36:06,307
Yes.

389
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:09,309
Tonight when the moon rises.

390
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:34,407
- Are you afraid?
- No.

391
00:36:34,513 --> 00:36:37,513
Let's go.

392
00:37:01,147 --> 00:37:04,117
It's a wolf. What did he say?

393
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,329
Wood and water.

394
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,137
Wind and tree.

395
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:29,012
Jungle favor go with thee.

396
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:32,840
You have been given the favor of the jungle.

397
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,138
We be of one blood...

398
00:37:49,544 --> 00:37:52,545
you and I.

399
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:04,591
We be of one blood, you and I.

400
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:09,333
Come, Mowgli. Come.

401
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:13,740
Come. Come.

402
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,793
Ahai, Hathi.

403
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,864
I am with the Man-Pack now.

404
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:03,488
See, I have my tooth--
as sharp as a tiger's tooth.

405
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:09,806
He said Shere Khan is far away...

406
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,410
but I had better take care and hide
when he comes back here.

407
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:18,580
Hathi, will you warn me
when he comes back to our jungle?

408
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:25,052
Thank you, brothers.

409
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:28,221
Then we shall see whose bones
will be laid in the river.

410
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,800
Hold on. Tight.

411
00:39:56,216 --> 00:39:58,450
Bagheera.

412
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:01,451
Mowgli.

413
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:14,296
Your claws are sharp and strong.

414
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,462
But not as good as mine.

415
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,201
Look.

416
00:40:22,472 --> 00:40:25,603
Who is man that I should
care for his ways?

417
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,543
Brown digger, eater of earth.

418
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:32,265
I am Mowgli of the jungle,
back in the night.

419
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:36,547
Now that I have my tooth,
who shall stay me when I strike?

420
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:39,486
Mowgli, come back.
I'm afraid.

421
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:24,421
There.

422
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:27,423
Mighty hunters,
greater than your father...

423
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:31,326
who killed everything
until the jungle killed them.

424
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:32,928
Why did they go away?

425
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,266
Why did I go away?

426
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:38,900
Because I was a man cub,
afraid of a tiger.

427
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,436
The jungle knew I was afraid
and cast me out.

428
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,909
This was the king's palace.

429
00:41:48,113 --> 00:41:50,076
King?

430
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,011
What is a king?

431
00:41:52,116 --> 00:41:56,990
Oh, Mowgli. You know so much,
and yet you know so little.

432
00:41:57,887 --> 00:42:00,151
This was a great walled city...

433
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:05,189
a city with hundreds of elephants
and thousands of horses...

434
00:42:05,293 --> 00:42:08,191
and thousands and thousands of men.

435
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:10,427
And it all belonged to a great king.

436
00:42:14,502 --> 00:42:16,798
And where is this great king now?

437
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:20,168
And where is this great king now?

438
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,714
Where is he now?

439
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,819
Where is he now?

440
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,456
Mahala?

441
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,723
Mahala?

442
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:48,827
- Mahala?
- Mowgli. Mowgli.

443
00:42:49,364 --> 00:42:52,364
Here I am.

444
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:55,298
Mahala, are you hurt?

445
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:58,402
No, I'm all right.

446
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:09,179
The king's treasure chamber.

447
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:12,514
Look.

448
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:17,487
The emeralds.

449
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:20,488
Pearls.

450
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:57,351
This is like the stuff I gave Buldeo
for my tooth.

451
00:43:57,456 --> 00:44:02,722
The stuff that passes from hand to hand
and never grows warmer.

452
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:06,371
Only this is yellow, and that was brown.

453
00:44:10,433 --> 00:44:12,630
Let's get back to the light.

454
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,133
These pebbles are no good to eat.

455
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,651
There is nothing here. Nothing.

456
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,576
Am I nothing?

457
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:32,437
Father of cobras, we be of one blood,
you and I.

458
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,585
She's only a little cub from the Man-Pack.

459
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:38,252
She means thee no harm.

460
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:42,877
Who art thou with the knife
and the snake's tongue?

461
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:45,362
Mowgli, they call me.

462
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:49,085
I am of the jungle.
The wolves are my people.

463
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:51,530
Father of cobras, who art thou?

464
00:44:51,636 --> 00:44:55,091
I am the warden of the king's treasure.

465
00:44:55,939 --> 00:45:00,939
The great king built the stone above me
that I might teach death...

466
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:04,042
to those who come to steal.

467
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:08,366
Three times the stone
has been lifted by thieves.

468
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:12,147
Look at thy feet.

469
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:15,252
The thieves are still here.

470
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:21,990
But I am no thief.

471
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,629
Indeed.

472
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,030
Be still, Mahala. Be still.

473
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:34,831
Oh, no, boy.
Let her run to and fro a while.

474
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:38,140
Let her make some sport.

475
00:45:38,141 --> 00:45:41,597
The others did so until I touched them.

476
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,578
Then they whimpered a while...

477
00:45:45,947 --> 00:45:48,947
sighed and were still.

478
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:58,930
Kill him, Mowgli. Kill him.

479
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,166
Kill him?

480
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,070
Don't be afraid.

481
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:17,763
Look. Our father of cobras is so old,
he has outlived his poison.

482
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:23,225
Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.

483
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:26,330
I am ashamed.

484
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,100
There has been too much talk of killing.

485
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:32,206
Come, Mahala. We'll go now.

486
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:37,616
Keep that silly treasure.

487
00:46:38,822 --> 00:46:41,824
But I'll take this.

488
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:48,068
I can use it to prod Rama with.

489
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:51,073
Look at the ruby, Mowgli.

490
00:46:51,077 --> 00:46:53,576
You could buy hundreds of villages with it.

491
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,681
Aye, boy. Thousands of villages.

492
00:46:57,454 --> 00:46:59,757
Take it with thee.

493
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:04,329
But see that it does not kill thee at last.

494
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:07,435
Kill me? This stone?

495
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:10,440
Yes. I have outlived my poison...

496
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:16,135
but that ruby holds more death
than all my tribe.

497
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:19,990
It will kill and kill and kill...

498
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:23,332
for killing's sake.

499
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:28,123
My strength is dried up,
but this stone will do my work.

500
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:32,011
It is death, it is death, it is death.

501
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:35,918
But take the ruby if thou wilt.

502
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,671
Nay, father of cobras. I believe thee.

503
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,633
We shall go as we came.

504
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,503
Aye.

505
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:49,978
Ye be wise to take no death with thee.

506
00:47:51,883 --> 00:47:55,253
May I take just this one piece, Mowgli?

507
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,458
Keep it if you like.

508
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:08,433
Get up, lazy bones.

509
00:48:08,437 --> 00:48:13,407
I dreamed I was a princess
in the city of the great maharaja.

510
00:48:13,512 --> 00:48:14,810
Get up.

511
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:18,450
There's no fire in the grate,
and there is no rice here.

512
00:48:18,556 --> 00:48:20,691
But it was not a dream.

513
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,693
I saw the great king's city.

514
00:48:24,132 --> 00:48:27,235
Get on with you.
Enough of this talk.

515
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:37,353
Dream?

516
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:40,357
This is no dream.

517
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:43,729
Maybe I am dreaming.

518
00:48:47,472 --> 00:48:50,474
This is pure gold.

519
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:53,078
Who gave this to you, my darling child?

520
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:54,648
The white cobra.

521
00:48:54,752 --> 00:48:55,849
Cobra?

522
00:48:55,953 --> 00:48:57,619
Yes.

523
00:48:57,724 --> 00:48:59,523
I did not want the diamonds.

524
00:48:59,627 --> 00:49:01,092
Diamonds?

525
00:49:01,197 --> 00:49:03,566
Nor the big ruby.

526
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:05,099
Big ruby?

527
00:49:05,204 --> 00:49:07,573
This big.

528
00:49:07,574 --> 00:49:09,709
This big.

529
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:12,712
Where? What nonsense is this?

530
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:15,184
Where is this room-- this ruby?

531
00:49:15,288 --> 00:49:17,020
When did you go there?

532
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,024
Whose gold is this, Mahala?

533
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:21,497
The great king's gold.

534
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:24,799
In the treasure chamber
Of the king's palace.

535
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:28,473
I tell you, Father, Mowgli said
I might keep just this one.

536
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:31,048
Mowgli?

537
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:34,050
You have been in the jungle?

538
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:37,389
Last night Mowgli took me there.

539
00:49:37,494 --> 00:49:39,159
But, Father, you will not hurt him?

540
00:49:39,263 --> 00:49:42,456
I would not harm a hair on his head.

541
00:49:45,241 --> 00:49:48,741
But you must never let anyone
know about this.

542
00:49:48,846 --> 00:49:50,745
Not a living soul, do you hear?

543
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:53,852
Yes, Father.

544
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:17,424
Good morning, Buldeo.

545
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,532
Good morning.

546
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,804
I-I can't take you now, Buldeo.
It'll be at least another hour.

547
00:50:51,624 --> 00:50:54,524
Now wait a minute, Barber.
There-There is no river between us.

548
00:50:54,629 --> 00:50:58,264
Oh. Oh, my-- my poor leg.

549
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,767
Uh, uh -This lumbago is killing me.

550
00:51:00,872 --> 00:51:03,373
I can't go around with half my beard cut.

551
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,678
Ooh. Th--This lumbago is terrible.

552
00:51:05,782 --> 00:51:08,783
I-- I-I can hardly bend my knee.

553
00:51:09,888 --> 00:51:12,621
What makes you tremble
like wash upon a line?

554
00:51:12,727 --> 00:51:17,898
Now you keep out of this, Buldeo.
If I cut him, he-he doesn't have to pay.

555
00:51:18,002 --> 00:51:20,201
- Y-You want to cut me?
- No, no.

556
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:21,905
Now listen here, barber.

557
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:24,475
I'm not a man to be shorn
like a sheep in the midst of a brawl.

558
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,545
- Barber-
- I want...

559
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,014
- Barber?
- Hmm?

560
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,650
Move your left foot.

561
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,756
Well, uh...

562
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,562
I said the left foot.

563
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:38,669
Oh, oh, the-the l-l-l-l...

564
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:41,242
l-l-- left.

565
00:51:41,243 --> 00:51:42,941
Left.

566
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:46,048
This foot.

567
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,624
Excuse me, Buldeo.
You are standing on my money.

568
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,361
- Your money?
- I saw it first.

569
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:55,765
Jackals....

570
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,803
- It's mine.
- There's no need to quarrel.

571
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:01,642
- There's enough for all.
- Where? Where?

572
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:04,647
There's a lost city... in the jungle.

573
00:52:04,752 --> 00:52:06,384
- You have found a treasure.
- Where?

574
00:52:06,488 --> 00:52:09,153
Shh. Do you want to tell the whole village?

575
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,529
Not a word now.

576
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:15,078
My daughter found it with the jungle boy.

577
00:53:59,787 --> 00:54:01,618
Tiger's coming.

578
00:54:01,723 --> 00:54:04,726
Up, you dumb ones. Up.

579
00:54:08,068 --> 00:54:10,337
Up. Ho. Ho. Ho.

580
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:13,341
Ho. Ho. Ho.

581
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,528
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

582
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:27,531
Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.

583
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:29,333
Ho. Ho.

584
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:04,094
Tiger. Tiger.

585
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,905
- Th-Th-The--
- Tiger.

586
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,002
To the temple. To the temple.

587
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:12,710
To the temple.

588
00:55:15,684 --> 00:55:19,321
To the temple, all of you.

589
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:24,530
Shut the gates. Shut the gates.

590
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:41,330
Tiger. Tiger.

591
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:44,669
- Quickly, Little Frog, to the temple.
- No. Not I.

592
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:48,242
- I have my tooth.
- No, no. Don't go. Don't go.

593
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:51,348
Mowgli.

594
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:57,158
Wait.

595
00:55:57,263 --> 00:55:58,696
Don't go. He will kill you.

596
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,259
No. I shall bring back his yellow hide.

597
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,413
Mowgli.

598
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:11,153
Mowgli.

599
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:16,462
Where is your son, Messua?
Where did he go?

600
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:18,331
Stop him. He has gone after the tiger.

601
00:56:18,436 --> 00:56:21,108
Oh, that bragging of a child.

602
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:23,140
Don't be impatient, Buldeo.
He'll be back.

603
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:26,714
Suppose the tiger should kill him.
Ooh, what a tragic calamity.

604
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:31,076
No, no, we must save him.
We must bring him back.

605
00:56:31,428 --> 00:56:34,896
How kind you all are
to comfort me this way.

606
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:37,538
He really is a sweet boy.

607
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,639
I knew you would come to love him.

608
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:43,114
Love him? I wish I had a boy like him.

609
00:56:43,217 --> 00:56:44,715
Now, don't worry.

610
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:49,089
If he's not back in a short time,
I'll track him to the ends of the earth.

611
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:07,993
Kaa.

612
00:57:11,737 --> 00:57:13,035
Kaa.

613
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,714
I want to sleep.

614
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:21,121
Go away.

615
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:26,464
I have to talk to you.

616
00:57:26,466 --> 00:57:29,303
Who are you?

617
00:57:29,304 --> 00:57:32,307
Can't you see, Kaa?

618
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:36,161
What does the Law of the Jungle say?

619
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:40,156
We be of one blood...

620
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:41,689
ye and I.

621
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:44,797
Ye come.

622
00:58:00,229 --> 00:58:02,128
Ah.

623
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:05,038
It is a manling.

624
00:58:05,038 --> 00:58:08,042
It's I, Mowgli, Kaa.

625
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:11,952
The Little Frog...

626
00:58:11,953 --> 00:58:15,387
the one that used to throw stones at me?

627
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,861
I was a cub then, Kaa.

628
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:21,233
You called me a flat-headed earthworm.

629
00:58:21,436 --> 00:58:23,135
Forgive me...

630
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:26,434
for you are a wise, old, strong...

631
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:30,452
and most beautiful Kaa.

632
00:58:30,453 --> 00:58:33,457
True.

633
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:36,595
I am beautiful.

634
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:40,570
Yes.

635
00:58:40,572 --> 00:58:43,575
I am beautiful.

636
00:58:45,283 --> 00:58:48,387
Now that I am a man,
I have a tooth.

637
00:58:48,988 --> 00:58:51,789
I wish to pull the whiskers of death.

638
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:53,759
The striped one?

639
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,396
You know all things?

640
00:58:55,501 --> 00:58:58,694
I know that Shere Khan has killed...

641
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:01,777
and eaten...

642
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:04,684
and now sleeps by the bamboo.

643
00:59:04,686 --> 00:59:07,689
Tabaqui the jackal told me so...

644
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:11,227
uh, before he passed on.

645
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:13,598
Tabaqui?

646
00:59:13,703 --> 00:59:16,705
Yes, indeed.

647
00:59:19,012 --> 00:59:22,014
Here he is.

648
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:29,495
How may I slay his master, Kaa?

649
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,749
He'd kill you with one blow.

650
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,703
Let us go upstream.

651
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:47,324
Hold on, little brother.

652
00:59:58,117 --> 01:00:01,487
Shere Khan is nothing but a big cat...

653
01:00:02,592 --> 01:00:05,594
and all cats fear the water.

654
01:00:05,832 --> 01:00:08,366
But Shere Khan will not follow me
into the river.

655
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,375
Since you're a man...

656
01:00:11,377 --> 01:00:13,175
use your cunning.

657
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:16,283
And if I made him angry, Kaa...

658
01:00:16,421 --> 01:00:18,387
will he follow me into the river?

659
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:21,495
If he will not catch you first.

660
01:00:28,578 --> 01:00:30,845
Thank you, wisest of all.

661
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,817
Go on.

662
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,924
I'll wait for you here.

663
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,982
Wish me good hunting...

664
01:00:49,087 --> 01:00:52,724
O wise, strong and most beautiful Kaa.

665
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:56,365
Good hunting.

666
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:15,573
Good morning, Shere Khan.

667
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:17,711
Did I wake you up?

668
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:20,250
You hunter of worms...

669
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:23,088
you striped cattle thief.

670
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:26,106
Don't sneak away.

671
01:01:31,373 --> 01:01:33,005
Coward.

672
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,647
You mangy yellow dog.

673
01:01:35,649 --> 01:01:38,653
Come back.

674
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:45,969
Can't you jump?

675
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,972
Are you too old, you frog eater?

676
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:50,975
Fish killer.

677
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,978
I'll get your hide today.

678
01:02:22,311 --> 01:02:25,313
No, no. I won't come down.

679
01:02:29,993 --> 01:02:32,996
You come up to me.

680
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:37,171
Get this.

681
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:42,215
And this.

682
01:02:45,258 --> 01:02:48,260
Bah.

683
01:02:51,938 --> 01:02:54,941
Come on, Shere Khan. Catch me.

684
01:04:32,376 --> 01:04:34,677
- This is getting dangerous.
- Yes.

685
01:04:34,782 --> 01:04:37,249
Maybe there are tigers
waiting for us in this tall grass.

686
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:40,356
All right.

687
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:43,929
Stay here.

688
01:05:10,788 --> 01:05:13,791
Shere Khan is dead.

689
01:05:14,296 --> 01:05:16,699
I have killed Shere Khan.

690
01:05:22,378 --> 01:05:25,414
What if he finds the boy
and tears the secret from him...

691
01:05:25,518 --> 01:05:28,954
and-and then says he didn't find him?

692
01:05:29,059 --> 01:05:30,791
You're right.

693
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:33,600
We cannot trust him.

694
01:05:33,602 --> 01:05:37,506
Uh, you go first,
and I'll protect your rear.

695
01:05:37,676 --> 01:05:40,445
You go first,
and I'll protect your rear.

696
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:43,551
Go on.

697
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:48,093
By the Bull that bought me,
I made a promise...

698
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:50,502
a little promise.

699
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:54,496
Only thy coat is lacking
before I keep my word.

700
01:05:54,745 --> 01:05:57,761
Come, Shere Khan.
Lend me your coat.

701
01:05:57,952 --> 01:06:00,954
You won't need it anymore.

702
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:09,037
You don't need to shoot, Buldeo.
I have killed him.

703
01:06:09,141 --> 01:06:10,673
Look at him.

704
01:06:10,778 --> 01:06:13,780
This is the end of a very old war.

705
01:06:14,853 --> 01:06:17,855
Hmm. You have killed him.

706
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:21,094
You found him there.

707
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,978
I killed him with my tooth.
He is mine.

708
01:06:24,118 --> 01:06:27,313
Who are you to tell me what is yours?

709
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:30,662
Get up, boy.

710
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,601
You took my daughter
to the jungle last night.

711
01:06:33,705 --> 01:06:35,605
You took her to a lost city.

712
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:39,259
Come on.
Take me to the treasure chamber.

713
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,188
I will not take you, Buldeo.

714
01:06:42,293 --> 01:06:45,265
The Lost City is a city of death.

715
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,437
The treasure is death.

716
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:52,052
- I will never take you there.
- Come on, jungle brat.

717
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:58,093
Come on, or I'll shoot you.

718
01:07:00,736 --> 01:07:04,906
- Go ahead and shoot.
- You scum of the wolf cave.

719
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:11,221
I-I hope he didn't shoot the boy.

720
01:07:11,326 --> 01:07:14,330
No. No.

721
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,533
That's a sign for us.

722
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:28,395
Change back to a man...

723
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,836
and spare my life.

724
01:07:30,837 --> 01:07:33,840
Spare my life, Mowgli.

725
01:07:54,494 --> 01:07:59,374
I did not know you were anything
more than a herd boy.

726
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:03,076
May I rise up and go away...

727
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,813
my lord?

728
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:08,922
Get up.

729
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,836
Go. Tell Messua that Mowgli
has avenged her man.

730
01:08:15,942 --> 01:08:19,546
He has killed Shere Khan
and will bring home his yellow hide.

731
01:08:19,651 --> 01:08:21,383
Maharaja.

732
01:08:21,487 --> 01:08:24,492
Look.

733
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:27,701
Great king.

734
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,706
Go on.

735
01:08:33,182 --> 01:08:35,687
Maharaja.

736
01:08:35,688 --> 01:08:38,226
- Maharaja.
- Great king.

737
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:40,561
- Tell me the secret too.
- Tell me too.

738
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,867
They say there's enough for three.

739
01:08:42,972 --> 01:08:45,371
- Great king.
- Great king.

740
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:47,781
Three old vultures.

741
01:08:47,783 --> 01:08:51,155
- Go back to your village.
- Yes, milord.

742
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:57,335
- Ma-- Maharaja.
- My king.

743
01:08:58,173 --> 01:09:00,641
- Where -Where is the treasure?
- Go back to your village.

744
01:09:00,746 --> 01:09:04,295
Maharaja. Great lord.

745
01:09:05,523 --> 01:09:07,222
Here. Here, you.

746
01:09:07,327 --> 01:09:09,494
- Did he tell you the secret?
- Come on. Where's the treasure?

747
01:09:09,599 --> 01:09:12,501
Do ¡V Don't try to cheat us.
The boy told you where to go.

748
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,744
Boy indeed.

749
01:09:14,746 --> 01:09:19,183
Didn't I tell you the first time I saw him
he was a witch?

750
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:23,092
I saw him with my own eyes
change himself into a black panther.

751
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:26,065
Come on, Buldeo. No tricks now.

752
01:09:26,171 --> 01:09:30,577
If you try to cheat us, we'll change you
into something worse, I swear to you.

753
01:09:32,453 --> 01:09:35,155
Get down, Bagheera.
Stop their quarrel.

754
01:09:41,506 --> 01:09:44,709
The boy turned himself
into a black panther before my eyes.

755
01:09:44,815 --> 01:09:47,720
He is a witch, I tell you.

756
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:49,354
I must warn the village.

757
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:50,825
- Buldeo--
- Here.

758
01:09:50,929 --> 01:09:54,465
I still think you're lying,
and I'll soon find out.

759
01:10:25,742 --> 01:10:28,746
Ho.

760
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:39,504
Ho.

761
01:10:45,187 --> 01:10:47,424
Come, Shere Khan.

762
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:50,443
Look at Buldeo, the mighty hunter.

763
01:10:54,407 --> 01:10:57,411
Ho.

764
01:10:57,782 --> 01:10:59,749
Ho.

765
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:02,560
Now go get him. Get him.

766
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:04,828
What have I done?

767
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:07,635
Why do you stand there gaping so?
Gather branches. Build a fire.

768
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:09,705
Remember, he must have
a chance to confess.

769
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,844
Yes, the three of us
will deal with him alone.

770
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:13,915
We'll deal with him all right.

771
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:40,209
Clear the way.

772
01:12:09,581 --> 01:12:13,486
Buldeo, we are ready.
Bring the witch-boy.

773
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,925
Well, boy?

774
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:18,631
Witch or devil, whatever you are...

775
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:20,336
you heard them.

776
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:23,444
They are ready.

777
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:26,985
One last choice...

778
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:29,021
the secret or the fire.

779
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:31,497
Buldeo.

780
01:12:31,499 --> 01:12:33,398
Buldeo.

781
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:35,873
Let me talk to him.

782
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,878
Let me talk to him.

783
01:12:40,185 --> 01:12:42,389
Good.

784
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,394
You talk to him.

785
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:48,602
I will leave you alone.

786
01:12:57,559 --> 01:13:00,695
He won't tell.
I think we'll have to burn him.

787
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,907
Then we would never find the treasure.

788
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,596
We'll burn him...

789
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,268
but not now.

790
01:13:07,269 --> 01:13:10,498
The boy will lead us to the Lost City first.

791
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:13,601
Nathoo, my little son...

792
01:13:14,406 --> 01:13:17,683
why won't you tell them the secret?

793
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:21,471
Never will I take them into the jungle.

794
01:13:21,576 --> 01:13:23,772
But they will set you free...

795
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:26,010
free to live with me.

796
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:29,010
- Live with you?
- Aye.

797
01:13:29,014 --> 01:13:31,546
I have a jungle mother too...

798
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:34,512
and these two things
fight together in me...

799
01:13:34,616 --> 01:13:38,867
like the snakes fight
together in the spring.

800
01:13:38,985 --> 01:13:42,086
I was a wolf.
The jungle cast me out.

801
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:46,121
I am a man.

802
01:13:46,123 --> 01:13:48,455
The Man-Pack cast me out.

803
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,454
But you have killed Shere Khan.

804
01:13:50,558 --> 01:13:52,655
You can go back to the jungle.

805
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,759
Aye, you can be lord of the jungle.

806
01:13:56,862 --> 01:13:58,224
No.

807
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:01,229
I have nowhere to go...

808
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:04,507
but into the Red Flower-- the fire.

809
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:07,098
No.

810
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,333
But it does not matter.

811
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:13,467
The jungle will know from Bagheera
that I have killed Shere Khan.

812
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,067
No. The jungle will know from you, Mowgli.

813
01:14:17,172 --> 01:14:20,171
See? Here is your tooth.

814
01:14:21,508 --> 01:14:23,138
Mother.

815
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:26,241
Watch, watch, watch, watch.

816
01:14:29,112 --> 01:14:32,110
- See them'
- He'll escape.

817
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:36,379
Are you also too dumb to see it?

818
01:14:36,716 --> 01:14:40,413
Of course. He'll escape,
and then we'll follow him to the treasure.

819
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:43,517
That's right.

820
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:48,953
You two go to the edge of the jungle.

821
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:52,055
Wait there and mark his trail.

822
01:14:52,658 --> 01:14:55,657
Go.

823
01:15:04,564 --> 01:15:07,464
Your time is up.

824
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,514
It's the mother witch who freed him.

825
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,619
Get her.

826
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,992
Wait. Wait.

827
01:15:45,993 --> 01:15:49,025
Messua is no witch.

828
01:15:49,130 --> 01:15:52,131
But Buldeo is a bad...

829
01:15:54,404 --> 01:15:57,418
Tie both of them until I return.

830
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:10,224
Buldeo. He entered by this tree.

831
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,724
He never suspected we let him escape.

832
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:15,829
Don't say that.

833
01:16:17,636 --> 01:16:19,100
See?

834
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:22,204
There is his trail.

835
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:57,052
I'm ¡V I'm frightened.

836
01:16:57,123 --> 01:16:59,989
Hmm.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

837
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:01,924
We have our guns.

838
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:10,372
Let's go.

839
01:17:10,374 --> 01:17:13,374
We can't be very far away.

840
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,954
Listen, brothers.

841
01:17:24,059 --> 01:17:27,526
I have planted tracks for them
as deep as an elephant's.

842
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:36,606
They will be here soon.

843
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:45,451
Quiet, you grinning black shadow.

844
01:17:48,756 --> 01:17:49,955
Quiet, gray brother.

845
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:53,061
This is not our kill.

846
01:17:54,066 --> 01:17:57,066
- Look, look.
- Look.

847
01:17:59,573 --> 01:18:03,740
- Wait for me.
- Not so fast....

848
01:18:33,385 --> 01:18:35,283
I will be the maharaja.

849
01:18:35,388 --> 01:18:37,286
I will be the maharaja.

850
01:18:37,391 --> 01:18:40,925
I will be the maharaja
Of this mighty city.

851
01:18:41,029 --> 01:18:43,561
I will be the chief of all the temple.

852
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:47,133
I will be the chief of all the temple.

853
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:49,402
I will have all the barber shops.

854
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:52,140
I will have all the barber shops.

855
01:18:57,352 --> 01:18:59,249
Let's look for the treasure.

856
01:18:59,355 --> 01:19:02,989
Let's look for the treasure.

857
01:19:10,503 --> 01:19:13,503
You look over there.

858
01:19:42,012 --> 01:19:44,344
Uh--

859
01:19:44,449 --> 01:19:46,246
Look.

860
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:49,318
I found it. I found it.

861
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:51,420
He found it.

862
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:53,959
Come on. He found it.

863
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,527
Wait for me.
Wait for me.

864
01:19:56,632 --> 01:19:58,262
He found it. Come on.

865
01:19:59,368 --> 01:20:01,867
Wait for me, Buldeo.

866
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:04,170
- Let us go in there.
- Let us go in.

867
01:20:04,276 --> 01:20:06,240
I-I-- I found it.

868
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:08,477
I-I claim the right of first choice.

869
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:11,647
That's right. You deserve it.
He goes first.

870
01:20:12,653 --> 01:20:14,753
I'll help you.

871
01:20:17,193 --> 01:20:19,391
Help yourself. I'll help you.

872
01:20:35,518 --> 01:20:36,981
Shoot. Shoot.

873
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:39,588
Sh-Sh-- Shoot.

874
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:42,456
Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

875
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,325
Shoot. Shoot.

876
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,895
No, no. Don't ¡V Don't shoot. Don't.

877
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,866
Pull me out. Pull me out.
Pull me, Shoot, will you?

878
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:52,605
Pull me up.

879
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:57,536
You missed him.

880
01:21:01,559 --> 01:21:05,506
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

881
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:09,088
A million.

882
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:22,448
I'll never have to count again.

883
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,005
Maybe we've been cheated.

884
01:21:49,881 --> 01:21:52,886
It's gold. It's gold.

885
01:21:53,425 --> 01:21:58,487
It's the mother and father
Of all the rubies in the world.

886
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:03,351
Where's my royal turban?

887
01:22:04,556 --> 01:22:06,831
They're all pure gold...

888
01:22:10,377 --> 01:22:13,383
and they're all mine.

889
01:22:23,919 --> 01:22:26,091
I shall walk upon gold.

890
01:22:26,092 --> 01:22:28,498
I shall eat upon gold.

891
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,935
I shall use gold for a coverlet.

892
01:22:53,342 --> 01:22:54,676
- Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

893
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,167
- It's mine.
- Give it to me.

894
01:22:56,272 --> 01:22:58,106
No. Are you mad?
Shall I bash your heads in?

895
01:22:58,212 --> 01:23:00,280
- Give it to me. I had first choice.
- No, it's mine.

896
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:02,354
The old cobra was right.

897
01:23:02,459 --> 01:23:05,465
First, they go mad.

898
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,879
Don't forget, Buldeo, we are two to one.
I want that ruby.

899
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,552
- Let go.
- It's mine.

900
01:23:11,657 --> 01:23:13,624
- Let go.
- You miserable barber.

901
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:17,405
It belongs to my robe.
It belongs to me, you understand?

902
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:20,113
- It's mine.
- Have we lost our reason?

903
01:23:20,218 --> 01:23:21,852
Are we children?

904
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:25,687
Isn't there enough for three, 300, 3,000?

905
01:23:26,039 --> 01:23:29,310
We'll be the most powerful men in all India.

906
01:23:29,415 --> 01:23:30,882
Here.

907
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:34,796
I can buy thousand of rubies like this
with my share.

908
01:23:35,901 --> 01:23:38,632
Buldeo, you are wise and good.

909
01:23:39,617 --> 01:23:42,790
You saved my life.
You killed the cobra.

910
01:23:42,895 --> 01:23:44,428
You are my friend.

911
01:23:44,535 --> 01:23:46,736
Then stop quarrelling.
Load yourselves up.

912
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,037
We have to get out before nightfall.

913
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:30,817
Hurry. We've got to get out of here now.

914
01:24:56,074 --> 01:24:58,645
Thieves. Vultures.

915
01:24:58,751 --> 01:25:00,889
Get out of the jungle.

916
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:03,896
Get out.

917
01:25:05,204 --> 01:25:08,209
D-Did I hear what I heard?

918
01:25:09,319 --> 01:25:11,856
The panther spoke
with the tongue of the boy.

919
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,761
Yes.

920
01:25:13,867 --> 01:25:17,687
The boy spoke
with the tongue of the panther.

921
01:25:19,886 --> 01:25:22,891
This place is bewitched.

922
01:25:28,014 --> 01:25:31,020
Oh, the gold.

923
01:26:04,771 --> 01:26:07,776
This is the way.

924
01:26:18,717 --> 01:26:21,723
Where's the log? It was here.

925
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:24,868
How do we cross now?

926
01:26:34,339 --> 01:26:37,278
We can wade through.

927
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,530
Wait.

928
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:57,626
There are crocodiles in this river.

929
01:27:07,725 --> 01:27:10,718
What are you waiting for?

930
01:27:29,178 --> 01:27:31,570
- It's this way.
- No, no. We came past this tree.

931
01:27:31,675 --> 01:27:33,970
- I tell you, it's this way. Come on.
- No.

932
01:27:34,075 --> 01:27:36,367
Quiet. Don't argue, Barber.

933
01:27:36,473 --> 01:27:38,466
You're going the wrong way.
You're going the wrong way.

934
01:27:38,572 --> 01:27:40,399
Give it to me.

935
01:27:40,503 --> 01:27:43,097
- Wait here. Come on. Come on.
- Look.

936
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:45,796
They are heading back to the Lost City.

937
01:27:45,901 --> 01:27:48,495
- Here it is. There it is. Come on.
- Over there is right. Let's go.

938
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,319
Come on.

939
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:09,864
Now I shall see
if Father Cobra spoke the truth.

940
01:28:10,503 --> 01:28:13,037
If the thing is death...

941
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:16,038
these men will die.

942
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:52,451
You saw it.

943
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:55,452
I only wanted to look at the gold.

944
01:29:58,623 --> 01:30:01,621
And he-- he tried to kill me.

945
01:30:02,627 --> 01:30:05,625
I had to do it, Buldeo.

946
01:30:05,663 --> 01:30:07,293
I had to do it.

947
01:30:07,397 --> 01:30:10,396
Naturally.

948
01:30:12,736 --> 01:30:15,735
You -You must bear witness.

949
01:30:18,107 --> 01:30:21,385
Please, you must bear witness, Buldeo.

950
01:31:11,617 --> 01:31:14,615
Quiet, gray brother.

951
01:32:05,827 --> 01:32:07,724
He tried to kill me, Buldeo.

952
01:32:07,829 --> 01:32:10,325
You must bear witness.
I had to kill him.

953
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:12,828
I had to kill him, Buldeo.

954
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:15,931
He...

955
01:32:57,267 --> 01:33:00,266
Help. H-H-Help.

956
01:33:10,146 --> 01:33:13,144
Help.

957
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:15,844
Did I hear someone call?

958
01:33:24,489 --> 01:33:26,453
Now, gray brother...

959
01:33:26,557 --> 01:33:29,556
there is only one.

960
01:33:30,394 --> 01:33:33,393
Bagheera, gray brother...

961
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:35,960
chase him out of the jungle.

962
01:33:36,065 --> 01:33:39,064
Sing him home.

963
01:34:59,899 --> 01:35:02,566
You grinning monster.

964
01:35:02,568 --> 01:35:05,566
Change into any beast you will.

965
01:35:05,637 --> 01:35:08,103
Wolf, panther...

966
01:35:08,106 --> 01:35:10,439
any beast you will.

967
01:35:10,441 --> 01:35:12,807
I'm not afraid of you.

968
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:14,107
Change.

969
01:35:14,212 --> 01:35:17,210
Change.

970
01:35:24,419 --> 01:35:26,115
Scream.

971
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:30,086
Scream, you witches of the forest.

972
01:35:32,192 --> 01:35:36,002
Scream.

973
01:35:37,596 --> 01:35:41,139
I'll burn that mother witch Messua...

974
01:35:41,267 --> 01:35:43,763
and I'll come back
with a hundred strong...

975
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:46,298
and set fire to your jungle...

976
01:35:46,404 --> 01:35:48,300
when the east wind blows.

977
01:35:50,373 --> 01:35:52,739
I'll burn you all.

978
01:35:52,742 --> 01:35:54,372
Burn you all.

979
01:35:54,477 --> 01:35:56,677
Burn you all.

980
01:35:56,679 --> 01:36:01,144
Hathi. Thou knowest the village
Of the Man-Pack that cast me out.

981
01:36:02,884 --> 01:36:06,251
They're idle, senseless and cruel.

982
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:09,950
They do not kill the weaker for food...

983
01:36:10,055 --> 01:36:12,288
but for sport.

984
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:17,023
When they are full-fed, they would throw
their own breed into the Red Flower.

985
01:36:17,128 --> 01:36:19,394
This I have seen.

986
01:36:19,397 --> 01:36:22,728
It is not well that the Man-Pack
should live here anymore.

987
01:36:28,504 --> 01:36:31,038
Kill them? Why?

988
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,318
What good are their white bones to me?

989
01:36:34,977 --> 01:36:38,107
We shall let the jungle in upon them...

990
01:36:38,212 --> 01:36:42,731
and give the village back
to the wild gourd vine.

991
01:36:54,025 --> 01:36:56,825
They will burn us both.

992
01:36:56,827 --> 01:37:00,025
Why did you fight them, Durga?
Why did you defend me?

993
01:37:00,129 --> 01:37:03,093
It was I who brought him into the world.
He's my son.

994
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:05,598
Aye, mistress.

995
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,698
You could have saved yourself, Durga.

996
01:37:07,803 --> 01:37:09,433
No, mistress.

997
01:37:09,537 --> 01:37:16,094
If you must leave the world tonight,
it is written that I shall go with you.

998
01:37:19,345 --> 01:37:21,207
Buldeo is here. Look.

999
01:37:21,314 --> 01:37:24,312
Buldeo.

1000
01:37:25,884 --> 01:37:28,882
What happened?

1001
01:37:38,693 --> 01:37:41,258
- Where is the pundit?
- Where is the barber?

1002
01:37:41,363 --> 01:37:44,361
Dead. Both dead.

1003
01:37:44,932 --> 01:37:47,699
Killed by the wolfboy.

1004
01:37:47,702 --> 01:37:50,700
But I know how to deal with him.

1005
01:37:51,037 --> 01:37:52,700
I'll burn him.

1006
01:37:52,806 --> 01:37:54,368
Burn him up.

1007
01:37:54,473 --> 01:37:58,016
I'll burn him.

1008
01:38:43,881 --> 01:38:47,070
We're all lost if the wind turns.

1009
01:39:24,513 --> 01:39:27,791
The jungle is burning.
Hurry up, Hathi.

1010
01:39:38,357 --> 01:39:39,720
Mowgli.

1011
01:39:39,825 --> 01:39:42,823
Where's my mother?

1012
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:44,957
What have you done with her?

1013
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:48,059
They left Messua bound in her house.
They would not let me take her.

1014
01:39:48,165 --> 01:39:51,663
They said she was a witch
and that the fire would take her.

1015
01:39:51,768 --> 01:39:53,498
Now the same fire will take them.

1016
01:39:53,603 --> 01:39:56,201
But they were frightened, Mowgli.

1017
01:39:56,305 --> 01:39:59,869
Lead them, Mahala, to the little island
in the middle of the stream.

1018
01:39:59,974 --> 01:40:04,306
- Where we saw the elephants, Mowgli?
- Yes. The fire can't touch you there.

1019
01:40:04,411 --> 01:40:07,410
Hurry. The wind is shifting.

1020
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:39,934
Break the door, Hathi.
Break the door.

1021
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:42,641
Push. Push.

1022
01:40:42,642 --> 01:40:45,640
Harder. Push.

1023
01:40:48,579 --> 01:40:50,209
I knew you would come.

1024
01:40:50,314 --> 01:40:53,313
See, Durga?

1025
01:41:23,776 --> 01:41:27,306
You'll be safe among them now.
- But you, my son-- Come with us.

1026
01:41:27,411 --> 01:41:31,841
Not while one little cub is in danger.
Now, go too.

1027
01:41:53,466 --> 01:41:56,464
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.

1028
01:42:12,847 --> 01:42:14,978
Swim, gray brother. Follow me.

1029
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:18,082
This way. Follow me.

1030
01:42:28,995 --> 01:42:31,994
Come on, Bagheera.

1031
01:42:33,298 --> 01:42:36,297
Come on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.

1032
01:43:07,759 --> 01:43:10,757
Go on, Hathi. Go on. Go on.

1033
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:03,467
Mowgli.

1034
01:44:09,676 --> 01:44:12,674
Come back with us at last.

1035
01:44:17,249 --> 01:44:19,211
I am of the jungle.

1036
01:44:19,315 --> 01:44:21,748
Their lair is my lair.

1037
01:44:21,751 --> 01:44:24,585
Their trail is my trail.

1038
01:44:24,587 --> 01:44:26,821
Their fight is my fight.

1039
01:44:35,264 --> 01:44:36,593
Ahai.

1040
01:44:36,697 --> 01:44:39,695
He's no longer my son.

1041
01:44:43,703 --> 01:44:46,701
He's a godling of the woods.

1042
01:44:49,107 --> 01:44:53,625
So I didn't have my revenge after all.

1043
01:44:54,144 --> 01:44:56,911
I became no Mharaja...

1044
01:44:56,913 --> 01:44:59,245
of a mighty city.

1045
01:44:59,248 --> 01:45:03,147
Even the little village burned to the ground.

1046
01:45:03,552 --> 01:45:06,550
In my struggle with the jungle...

1047
01:45:06,821 --> 01:45:09,655
as you see, milords...

1048
01:45:09,657 --> 01:45:11,119
I was beaten.

1049
01:45:11,224 --> 01:45:12,987
And then? What happened then?

1050
01:45:13,092 --> 01:45:15,289
What became of Mowgli
and your daughter?

1051
01:45:15,395 --> 01:45:17,993
And how did you escape from the fire?

1052
01:45:18,097 --> 01:45:19,994
That, memsahib...

1053
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:22,184
is another story.
