1
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:28,109
This is the worst storm yet.

2
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:29,888
Yeah, almost
every night

3
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,164
for the last three months.

4
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,995
Well, it sure ain't natural.

5
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:40,690
I'm getting away from this
lightning while I still can.

6
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,521
Ah, you'll be soaked to the bone
before you get ten yards.

7
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,939
Well I'd better
be soaked than barbecued.

8
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,700
What if we ran for it?

9
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,120
It's impossible
to make it to the main road.

10
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:09,705
Maybe we can make it
to the old willows place?

11
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,204
Are you out of your mind?

12
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:13,738
Do you actually
believe in them monsters?

13
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,839
But the newspaper
story said...

14
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,143
Oh, act your age, Mac.

15
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:25,723
Here's the house.

16
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:28,095
Don't look good to me.

17
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:29,604
Ah, you're just spooked.

18
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:32,914
Well, spooked or not, that
place just don't look healthy.

19
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,911
It hasn't been lived in
in 15 years, it's deserted.

20
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:37,500
It is, huh?

21
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,380
Thought you said
this place was deserted?

22
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,426
Well, it's supposed
to be. I don't get it.

23
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,720
what do you want?

24
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:00,877
Let's get out of here.

25
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:03,963
Uh, we didn't
think anybody lived here.

26
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:05,519
It was all his idea.

27
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,675
We thought maybe
we could get out of the rain.

28
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:09,634
It looks like
it's going to last all night.

29
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,948
It's pretty bad out there.

30
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,380
Oh no, you can't stay.

31
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,380
Oh, be reasonable.

32
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,377
You can't stay.

33
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:16,886
We might catch pneumonia.

34
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,995
You're not welcome in my house.

35
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:22,503
Go away, now, go, go, go.

36
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:23,761
Lobo!

37
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:27,584
Lobo! No, no!

38
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:28,754
The monster!

39
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,076
Now you believe
those newspaper stories?

40
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:34,082
Do you hear that, lobo?
You're the monster.

41
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,079
Perhaps, one day
you will meet the monster.

42
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:38,168
Heh, heh, heh.

43
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:37,277
Wait, wait!
I can't run anymore.

44
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,273
We gotta keep going.

45
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,690
That was the monster.

46
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:44,653
Well, I wouldn't give to see a
couple of cops right about now.

47
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:45,750
Come on.

48
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:16,144
you, get these straps off of me.

49
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:21,893
Let me loose, do you hear me?

50
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:24,013
Lobo hears,

51
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:26,242
but he cannot speak.

52
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:29,043
Lobo is mute.

53
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:33,409
Because of
the storm, I was afraid

54
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:36,076
we were not going
to have guests tonight.

55
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:42,669
Lobo, you're too
rough with my patient.

56
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:52,834
Already, he tires
of our humble hospitality.

57
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,560
I said, let me out of here.

58
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,322
At the moment,
i am afraid it is impossible.

59
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,045
Who are you?

60
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:02,132
Vornoff, Dr. Eric vornoff.

61
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:05,577
The name will
mean little to you.

62
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:50,832
what are you doing to me?

63
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:54,356
You will be soon
as big as a giant.

64
00:08:57,276 --> 00:09:00,030
Strength of 20 men.

65
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:04,672
Or, like all the others,

66
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:06,416
dead.

67
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:22,814
Turn off the switch.

68
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,017
Isn't it strange, lobo?

69
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:22,025
Our friend always returns home
after his long, tiresome swim.

70
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,246
What's your name?

71
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,803
You find out.

72
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,689
We will.
Hey, watch that cigarette.

73
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:06,026
What were
you doing in the swamp?

74
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:06,782
What's it to you?

75
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,204
That's enough of that, buster.

76
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:12,080
No tank town jail
can hold me.

77
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,858
I'll be out of this
here rat trap in 24 hours.

78
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,585
That's what you think.

79
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:19,365
Vagrancy will
hold you for 72 hours.

80
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:20,757
Take him downstairs
and book him.

81
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,004
All right, let's go.

82
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:23,827
Let go of me, I said.

83
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,524
You can't do that to me.
Let go.

84
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:39,309
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

85
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,856
What do you mean,
where do I think I'm going?

86
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,740
I've got captain
Robbins' newspapers.

87
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:43,970
You have, have you?

88
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,055
And since when you don't leave
the captain's papers with me?

89
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:48,124
Since the captain told
me to bring 'em in myself.

90
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:49,840
When you read 'em first,
you mess 'em up.

91
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,440
Hold your tongue
and give me those papers

92
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,579
or I'll have you locked up
for peddling without a license.

93
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,667
I got a license.

94
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:58,438
Want to bet I can
make it expire all of a sudden?

95
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:19,715
Come in.

96
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,087
Here's the late
editions, captain.

97
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,085
Look, why can't
i work on this case?

98
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,534
Get back to your desk.

99
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:30,495
Yes, sir.

100
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:32,712
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?

101
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,158
I told the boy to bring
the papers in himself.

102
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:36,791
Yes, sir.
But if you ask me...

103
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,130
I didn't.

104
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:39,573
Yes, sir.

105
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,580
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?

106
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,070
Where's lieutenant Craig?

107
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,478
In his office, I think.

108
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:45,322
Send him in.

109
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,090
Yes, sir, right away, sir.

110
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,572
come in.

111
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:32,996
Hi, captain.

112
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:34,820
Hello, dick, sit down.

113
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:36,438
Seen today's papers?

114
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,397
Is there anyone who hasn't?

115
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:41,537
Well, there's the one
nice thing about birds.

116
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,620
They never cause
anybody any trouble.

117
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,392
Your girlfriend
writes a good story.

118
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,412
She thinks so.
Anything new.

119
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:49,501
No.

120
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:53,247
12 disappearances around this place
and nothing to go on.

121
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,184
And nothing this time either.

122
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:59,270
Been around that swamp so many
times, I'm getting web-footed.

123
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:02,757
It's been fired recently.

124
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,269
It's been fired
several times recently.

125
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,055
jake long's wife identified
it a little while ago.

126
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,412
The coat belonged to
Ralph mcrae, his partner.

127
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:15,229
They went hunting by
marsh lake and never returned.

128
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:16,361
Not much left of it.

129
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,185
Boys found
it floating in the lake.

130
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,389
What about the rifle?

131
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,713
About a mile from
the old willows place.

132
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:22,713
All ties together.

133
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,216
But it doesn't prove anything.

134
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:27,015
You think there's anything
in these monster stories?

135
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,474
Your girlfriend does.

136
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:29,523
What about you?

137
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:31,521
The police
don't believe in monsters.

138
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:32,868
Facts are our business.

139
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,075
Facts and only facts,
and don't you forget it.

140
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,003
I'm telling you,
the captain isn't seeing nobody.

141
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,083
Now please be a good girl,
miss lawton, and go.

142
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:43,202
Captain Robbins, will you tell
this junior g-man to let me go?

143
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,701
Kelton.
Yes, sir.

144
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,973
Let her go.

145
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:47,802
Just as you say, captain.

146
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,704
It used to
be a newspaper reporter

147
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:53,752
could get information
around this place.

148
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:55,981
What in the world do you mean?

149
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,781
Now, he makes like a comic.

150
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:59,987
Dick Craig, I don't put
much stock

151
00:15:00,077 --> 00:15:01,486
in the future success
of our married life

152
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,989
if already you're
holding out secrets on me.

153
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,071
You've been dodging me
all day.

154
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,746
Where'd you
get an idea like that?

155
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,712
You mean you
haven't been dodging me?

156
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:12,209
No.
And all those times I called.

157
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,850
And kelton said the line
was busy, it really was?

158
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,939
Yes.

159
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:19,512
Ok, let's have the story
on lake marsh and the monster.

160
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:22,778
Uh... monster, monster... aaah.

161
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:24,209
I thought so.

162
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,962
There is no
such thing as monsters,

163
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:27,750
this is the 20th century.

164
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,057
Don't count on it.

165
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,592
Monsters, I mean.

166
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:31,703
Now, Janet.

167
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,589
Don't you "now, Janet" me.

168
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,088
And you can count
our engagement off.

169
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:36,874
- You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.

170
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:37,963
No, she doesn't.

171
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:39,893
I most certainly do.

172
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,553
Well, then, give him back
the ring.

173
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:42,245
What?

174
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,629
If you're throwing over the
marriage, give him back the ring.

175
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,484
Now, chief, I...

176
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:48,017
Captain.
Give him back the rock.

177
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,516
It's the only fair thing.

178
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,145
I'd rather throw it
in lake marsh first.

179
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:55,666
Besides, we've got
to leave our personal lives

180
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:56,611
out of our business lives.

181
00:15:56,701 --> 00:15:57,664
As it should be.

182
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:59,162
As I've been saying
all along.

183
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:02,442
Dog! Now, what about
the monster story?

184
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:03,452
Well, that's your own story.

185
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,335
You wrote it
and you're stuck with it.

186
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,753
There's no
such thing as monsters.

187
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:10,362
But two more men
have vanished up at lake marsh.

188
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,507
That makes
12 in three months.

189
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,104
Everything points
to an inhuman violence.

190
00:16:15,593 --> 00:16:18,227
Or do you still stick to
the alligator devouring routine?

191
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:19,313
Oh!

192
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,401
You're withholding
news from the public.

193
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,721
Janet, you may not
believe this,

194
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:26,035
but you got
all the story there is.

195
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,987
You're right,
i don't believe it.

196
00:16:28,077 --> 00:16:29,784
Well, nevertheless,
it's the truth.

197
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:34,278
Except for the monster, figment
of your very vivid imagination.

198
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,276
While we've got
nothing more to go on

199
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,864
than what you reported
to the paper.

200
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:41,635
The figment of my imagination
is something I believe

201
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,766
and you haven't
been able to disprove it.

202
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,328
We've conducted
every possible search.

203
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:49,635
Monsters, it's fantastic.
You know that.

204
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,968
Our business
is dealing in facts, evidence.

205
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:54,411
Can't you see that?

206
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,433
Men disappearing. Huh.

207
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,298
There's plenty
of quicksand out there.

208
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,795
Yeah,
12 went down in the same place.

209
00:17:01,885 --> 00:17:04,042
Well, we're doing
our best to solve it.

210
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,822
Maybe your
best isn't good enough.

211
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:07,320
- Janet!
No, I mean it.

212
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,664
No clues.

213
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,066
What's this, a dancing costume?

214
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,447
And this, a pogo stick?

215
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:16,451
Well, I've got to admit
those we're found at the lake.

216
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,853
But remember,
they were in your own story.

217
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:21,179
No human did this.

218
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:22,806
So you say.

219
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:27,826
Well, looks like I've run
into a dead end around here.

220
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:32,165
Ok, if you boys wanna
play a game of secrets.,

221
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:33,754
there's nothing
left for me to do

222
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,153
but take a run out
to lake marsh myself.

223
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:38,077
Over my dead body.

224
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,565
That could be arranged.

225
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,040
Goodbye.

226
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,897
She's just crazy
enough to do what she says.

227
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,905
- You know what, captain?
What?

228
00:17:55,995 --> 00:17:57,713
I think you're right.

229
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:32,632
Hi, tillie.

230
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:34,983
Hi, Janet.
Long time no see.

231
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,501
Tillie, do you remember
a couple of years ago

232
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,616
in the real estate section

233
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:40,638
when the old willows
place out on lake marsh

234
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:43,145
was up for sale,
against back taxes?

235
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:48,140
Seems to me that was around
November or December of '48.

236
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,783
- Wanna see the files?
Yes.

237
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:51,337
Just a minute.

238
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,397
Here they are.

239
00:18:56,451 --> 00:18:58,900
October to December, '48.

240
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,218
In the top file there.

241
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,398
I won't be long.

242
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:05,484
Take your time I ain't going
anyplace, and neither are they.

243
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,356
Find what you wanted, Janet?

244
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,224
Yes, thanks. Sorry to leave
such a mess for you.

245
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:28,312
Well, that's
what I get paid for.

246
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,437
Be a dear, tillie.
Call the boss.

247
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:31,790
Tell him I'll be gone
the rest of the day,

248
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,877
- I'll report in later.
Sure thing.

249
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:35,231
On something hot?

250
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:36,829
Oh, it could be.

251
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,440
Oh, and dick.

252
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,437
Call him at headquarters,
break my dinner date with him.

253
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,944
Tell him I... I have
an ulcer or something.

254
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,442
Leave it to me. I fix.

255
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:48,030
Ok.

256
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,936
- Hi, Janet.
Oh, hi, Marge.

257
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,506
Janet. Still
on the monster hunt?

258
00:19:53,596 --> 00:19:54,644
What do you think?

259
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,198
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.

260
00:19:57,288 --> 00:20:01,060
Something about the police
wanting those monster stories 86'd.

261
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,978
You've got
the whole town in a panic.

262
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,197
I didn't hear you.

263
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,313
- I said...
I know what you said.

264
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:08,018
But I didn't hear you.

265
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,711
I get it. See you later.

266
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:35,778
Lieutenant Craig has
been working on the case

267
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:36,936
a long time, professor.

268
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,057
I'd like him to hear
what you just told me.

269
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,989
I should be happy
to cooperate.

270
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,369
Oh, hello, dick.

271
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:46,493
Professor Vladimir strowski,
lieutenant Craig.

272
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,604
Glad to meet you, professor.

273
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:48,853
How do you do?

274
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,368
Professor, will you
bring him up to date?

275
00:20:52,482 --> 00:20:56,454
Lieutenant Craig, have you
ever heard of loch ness?

276
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:59,647
I think so. That's
a lake in Scotland, isn't it?

277
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:02,810
Mm. Then perhaps
you are familiar

278
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,367
with the loch ness monster.

279
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,436
Vaguely.

280
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:10,705
A few years ago, I was
called in by the British police

281
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:14,759
to investigate the appearance
of a monster at loch ness.

282
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,023
Well, they thought
that it was some creature

283
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:19,306
left over from a bygone age.

284
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:23,002
I am considered
an authority on the subject

285
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:26,099
of prehistoric monsters.

286
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,993
However, I must admit
that my investigation failed

287
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,951
to get the desired results,

288
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:36,178
in that I did not
see the monster myself.

289
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:37,862
But others did.

290
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:39,632
There are sworn statements.

291
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,951
Professor, is it
your theory that perhaps

292
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,548
the loch ness monster crossed
the ocean and came to the swamp?

293
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:50,366
I consider that possibility
extremely remote.

294
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:54,232
But the cases
do bear a certain similarity,

295
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:57,240
in that there are
so many varied descriptions

296
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,861
of this so-called monster.

297
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:04,003
And I thought perhaps, with
my knowledge of such things,

298
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,321
and with your
permission, of course,

299
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,363
that I might be able to shed
some light on this mystery.

300
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:13,859
That is the reason
for my presence here.

301
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:15,983
What do you think, dick?

302
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:20,063
Well, there's no denying
we need help of some sort.

303
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:23,280
And you'll keep your findings
secret for the time being?

304
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:25,041
As you will.

305
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,262
And you don't
mind a little company?

306
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:29,869
How do you mean, company?

307
00:22:30,823 --> 00:22:32,068
Lieutenant Craig.

308
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:34,655
At times, the police
can be quite useful.

309
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:38,203
I should be most happy to have
lieutenant Craig's assistance.

310
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:41,842
How soon can you be ready to leave
for lake marsh, lieutenant Craig?

311
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:43,142
I'm ready.

312
00:22:43,232 --> 00:22:46,506
Well, I suggest
we wait until morning.

313
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:49,011
There was a storm
brewing when I came in.

314
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,080
And it is
so close to nightfall.

315
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,080
According to reports,

316
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,836
the monster
strikes only at night.

317
00:22:57,624 --> 00:23:01,031
Undoubtedly true, but
the preliminary investigation

318
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,491
should take
place in daylight.

319
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:07,664
The night,
the monster, all in good time.

320
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:10,132
Sounds logical.

321
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,272
Whatever you say.

322
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:15,268
Now, gentlemen, since I just
arrived in town this afternoon,

323
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:16,776
if you will excuse me,

324
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,742
i should like
to return to my hotel.

325
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:21,127
Certainly, sir.

326
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:22,272
Good day, captain.

327
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:23,585
Professor.

328
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,272
Until morning, lieutenant Craig.

329
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:32,572
I'll be here.

330
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,198
Strange sort of bird.

331
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,145
Where do I meet him?

332
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:46,977
Here, ten o'clock.

333
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:49,058
That will give
him plenty of daylight.

334
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,755
Well, see you later.

335
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:52,245
Hmm, got a date?

336
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,159
What do you think?

337
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:56,125
I'll say you don't.

338
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:58,237
I don't?

339
00:23:58,327 --> 00:23:59,667
Girl from her office called in.

340
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:03,653
Said that Janet had a headache
or some such thing.

341
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:05,539
If she's
gone to lake marsh alone.

342
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,369
I'll take her across my knee,

343
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:08,610
if it's the last thing I do.

344
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,021
Well, it probably would be.

345
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,531
Watch him, dick.

346
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:13,498
Strowski?

347
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:14,819
Just a hunch.

348
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:16,096
Right.

349
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,074
you are all right now, my dear.

350
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:25,756
What?

351
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:28,657
Who... who are you?

352
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:32,156
I'm... I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.

353
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:34,750
You had a severe shock.

354
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,163
Oh.

355
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:38,613
How did I get here?

356
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,224
Oh.

357
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:44,115
That's not
important for the moment.

358
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:48,044
What you need now is rest.

359
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,043
Rest.

360
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,327
You will sleep.

361
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,331
Sleep.

362
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:07,326
For the lovely young lady,

363
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,111
sleep.

364
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,243
Well, here we are
at the fork in the road.

365
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,241
Like they say
in all good westerns,

366
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,674
which way to go?

367
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,532
Well, that's
the road to the willows place.

368
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:49,244
Let's take a chance on that one.

369
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,114
Ok. You know,
i get to hate this swamp more

370
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,938
every time I come out here.

371
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:56,848
You just weren't
born for swamp duty, Marty.

372
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:58,204
Yeah, I guess you're right.

373
00:27:58,294 --> 00:28:00,212
I'd like to
transfer to a department

374
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:01,806
as far away
from here as possible.

375
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:04,313
The wind and the rain.

376
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,795
Gives this place a gleam
that just isn't natural.

377
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,898
The ground
alive with crawling things,

378
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:13,665
crawling death.

379
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:15,343
You're right there, Marty.

380
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:18,056
This swamp
is a monument to death.

381
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:22,059
Snakes, alligators, quicksand,

382
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:24,773
all bent on one thing.

383
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:26,149
Destruction.

384
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:34,653
Something strange
about all this rain.

385
00:28:34,743 --> 00:28:36,862
The lightning's
been going crazy too.

386
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,150
Maybe it's like the papers said.

387
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,646
All these atom bomb explosions
distorted the atmosphere.

388
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:42,735
Maybe.

389
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:45,152
You know, if I was
this professor strowski guy,

390
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:47,535
i wouldn't come out in
this swamp without a guide.

391
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,530
You know, that's
the one thing I can't figure.

392
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:54,848
He comes to the office
with all these monster stories,

393
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:57,735
makes an appointment
to come out here with us,

394
00:28:58,146 --> 00:28:59,968
then he goes off by himself.

395
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:01,736
Are you sure he came out here?

396
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:05,121
Where else could he go?

397
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:08,852
Well, let's get at it.
Hm.

398
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,458
Janet's car?

399
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,657
Yeah,
there's not a trace of her.

400
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,130
Well, maybe
after the accident

401
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,733
she found her way down to the
road and then back into town.

402
00:29:48,823 --> 00:29:50,230
I've gotta be sure.

403
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,931
Look, there's a coffee joint
about ten miles back,

404
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:52,941
let's go and check.

405
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:54,496
- Let's go.
Ok.

406
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,205
Where did you find her car?

407
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,826
Not a sign of her?

408
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:22,787
Where's strowski?

409
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,837
I told you not
to let him out of your sight.

410
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,424
Right, captain.

411
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:29,769
I don't like
the looks of things.

412
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:32,959
Well, get back to strowski.

413
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,094
I'll get word to you later.

414
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,314
Yeah.

415
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,495
You look worried, dick.

416
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,019
No one.

417
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:46,214
Captain Robbins,
her apartment, her office.

418
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:48,817
No one has heard from
her since yesterday afternoon.

419
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:51,746
Captain Robbins
is checking further.

420
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:53,432
Ok, but what do we do?

421
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:55,958
Orders, find strowski.

422
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,237
Ah, get me the city desk.

423
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:19,552
Hello, Jim.

424
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:21,971
Yeah, about the lawton girl.

425
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,522
Uh, he just called me too.

426
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:27,317
Who saw her
last around your office?

427
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,655
Don't be afraid of lobo.

428
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,088
He's as gentle as a kitten.

429
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,306
Put the tray down here.

430
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,219
That is all.

431
00:32:58,387 --> 00:32:59,464
Get out.

432
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:08,893
I said, get out!

433
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,103
that is all.

434
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,270
Now come, my dear.

435
00:33:41,267 --> 00:33:42,945
Some cream or sugar?

436
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,842
You didn't
have your breakfast yet.

437
00:33:46,146 --> 00:33:47,729
Now it's past noon.

438
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:49,633
You must be hungry.

439
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:51,631
What happened to me?

440
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,722
Your automobile, an accident.

441
00:33:55,309 --> 00:33:57,949
Lobo brought you here.
To me.

442
00:33:58,104 --> 00:34:00,518
What is this place?
And who are you?

443
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:04,568
Don't you remember
i told you last night?

444
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,462
Did you tell me?

445
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:10,395
Yes, I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.

446
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,025
Oh. This is
the old willows place.

447
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,483
Yes.

448
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:20,681
How did you know?

449
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:22,680
I checked our real estate files.

450
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,990
A Dr. Eric vornoff
bought the willows place

451
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,653
in November of 1948.

452
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:32,148
You are a newspaper reporter,
huh?

453
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,237
Yes.

454
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:36,588
My name seems
to mean much to you.

455
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:41,229
Well, actually it wasn't
your name I was interested in.

456
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:43,595
Through
the mysteries of lake marsh,

457
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:46,076
and the willows place
being right on the lake.

458
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:49,189
I looked in the files
to see what happened to it.

459
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:52,006
Your name was
there as the purchaser.

460
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,218
I thought perhaps
you might have heard

461
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:55,650
something about the monster.

462
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,961
Oh, my dear miss lawton. I...

463
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:01,059
When did I tell you my name?

464
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:03,556
You didn't.

465
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,709
But since you were unconscious,

466
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:10,637
i took the Liberty
looking into your purse.

467
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,847
You must have
seen my press card.

468
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,621
Yes, I did.

469
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:17,751
Well, since you knew the answers
already, why the third degree?

470
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:19,728
And who or what
was that monster?

471
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:22,226
Oh, he's quite human.

472
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:24,723
I discovered him in
the wilderness of Tibet.

473
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:28,543
He has been quite
useful to me... at times.

474
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,392
But now, since
your tiring experience,

475
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:42,801
i think we have talked too much.

476
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:45,251
I'm not the least bit tired.

477
00:35:47,577 --> 00:35:49,864
But you are tired.

478
00:35:56,078 --> 00:36:00,584
You are so tired.

479
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:03,955
Strange.

480
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:06,482
Suddenly, I...

481
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,771
I do feel very tired.

482
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:16,235
Yes.

483
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:21,948
Very tired.

484
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:27,271
Very tired.

485
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:43,170
Lobo! Take the girl
to my quarters.

486
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,918
My dear professor strowski.

487
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:56,389
Well, it has been
a very long time.

488
00:38:56,938 --> 00:38:57,939
Vornoff.

489
00:38:58,251 --> 00:38:59,620
It is you.

490
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:01,951
You can see.

491
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:04,681
In Paris,
i missed you by a month.

492
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:06,169
In London, a week.

493
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:08,346
At loch ness,
by only one day.

494
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,876
The monster of lake marsh
sounded again like you.

495
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:15,972
Why the sudden interest in me,
professor strowski?

496
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:22,466
Your experiments
in atomic energy, of course.

497
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:28,690
Ah, so my dear country
now believes in my work.

498
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,284
And that it can be a success.

499
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:33,685
Our government wants
you to return, vornoff,

500
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,871
to continue your research
and experiments there,

501
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,361
where you can have
everything at your disposal.

502
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,915
Why do you laugh?

503
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,619
Surely this is not
a laughing matter?

504
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:48,462
My dear professor strowski.

505
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:54,240
20 years ago,
i was banned from my homeland.

506
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,617
Parted from my wife and son,

507
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:00,043
never to see them again.

508
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:01,670
Why?

509
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:06,014
Because I suggested
to use the atom elements

510
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,454
for producing super beings.

511
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:13,402
Beings of unthinkable
strength and size.

512
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,501
I was classed as a madman,

513
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:20,649
a charlatan,

514
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:24,144
outlawed in the world of science

515
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:27,241
which previously
honored me as a genius.

516
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:34,029
Now, here in this
forsaken jungle hell,

517
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:37,241
i have proven
that I'm all right!

518
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:41,692
Now, professor strowski,

519
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:45,853
it is no laughing matter.

520
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:50,864
Yes. Yes, indeed
it was a tragic error.

521
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:54,849
But, as soon as I had learned
how correct your findings were,

522
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:56,346
always have been,

523
00:40:56,436 --> 00:40:58,450
I informed those in authority.

524
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:02,436
Vornoff, I have
searched for you everywhere,

525
00:41:02,555 --> 00:41:05,845
everywhere I hear
stories of monsters.

526
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:08,386
Now, I am here,

527
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,969
sent to bring you home.

528
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:14,237
Home?

529
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:29,552
I have no home.

530
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:36,597
Hunted, despised,

531
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,539
living like an animal,

532
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:44,567
the jungle is my home.

533
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,945
But I will show the world

534
00:41:49,136 --> 00:41:51,269
that I can be its master.

535
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:57,600
I will perfect
my own race of people.

536
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:04,595
A race of atomic supermen
which will conquer the world.

537
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:11,750
Yes. Yes, of course.

538
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,243
A truly great master race,

539
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:19,057
such as I convinced my superiors
only you could create.

540
00:42:20,035 --> 00:42:21,443
One with which our government

541
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:24,530
can rule the world
without debate.

542
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:29,102
You misunderstand me, strowski.

543
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:33,969
I don't intend to return home.

544
00:42:35,283 --> 00:42:39,499
My plans are for myself.

545
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:41,988
Are you mad, vornoff?

546
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:45,918
One is always considered mad,

547
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:51,243
when one discovers something
that others cannot grasp.

548
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:00,015
Our government ordered
me to bring you back.

549
00:43:01,426 --> 00:43:05,258
I'm afraid you will
find that rather difficult.

550
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:10,338
You see, vornoff,
i did not come alone.

551
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:13,345
Neither did I,
my dear strowski.

552
00:43:13,435 --> 00:43:15,943
Bring him along, lobo.

553
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:22,799
Come, come.

554
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:24,347
Hurry!

555
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,017
You are a fool, vornoff.

556
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:34,054
You... you may... you may kill me,

557
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,302
but others will come.
Silence.

558
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:37,551
You will never get
away with this.

559
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:38,777
Put him in there.

560
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:41,422
Vornoff! Vornoff! No! No!

561
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:49,471
Help! Help!

562
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,129
Vornoff! Vornoff!

563
00:43:55,315 --> 00:43:56,560
Vornoff!

564
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,492
Now, professor strowski,

565
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:09,213
you will get a much closer view
of the product of my genius.

566
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:16,673
The alleged
monster of lake marsh.

567
00:44:22,558 --> 00:44:23,967
Vornoff! Vornoff!

568
00:44:24,057 --> 00:44:25,412
Vornoff! Vornoff!

569
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:30,452
Your country offers fame
and fortune for my return,

570
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:35,687
but my price is
so much more great.

571
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:43,455
You will disappear,
professor strowski,

572
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:47,184
just as all the others
have disappeared.

573
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:10,187
vornoff! Vornoff!

574
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:43,174
It's a rental car.

575
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:44,762
Think it's the one
strowski used?

576
00:45:44,852 --> 00:45:46,268
I'd make book it is.

577
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:48,229
It's getting dark now.

578
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,768
You take the car,
and go down to the beach.

579
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:53,061
I'll go through the swamp
to the old willows place.

580
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:54,071
Ok.

581
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:55,905
Oh, here.
You'd better take this with you.

582
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:56,921
Right.

583
00:45:57,011 --> 00:45:58,403
- Oh, Marty?
- Yeah?

584
00:45:58,493 --> 00:46:00,901
You see anything suspicious,
you know where I am.

585
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,488
Trouble is, everything
in this swamp is suspicious.

586
00:48:06,773 --> 00:48:08,042
What can I do for you, sir?

587
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:10,539
Captain Robbins, homicide.

588
00:48:10,629 --> 00:48:13,923
Why, captain I haven't murdered
anyone in a month of Sundays.

589
00:48:14,135 --> 00:48:16,444
Did Janet lawton stop by here
late yesterday afternoon?

590
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:19,085
Oh, just a like a policeman,
no sense of humor.

591
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:21,033
Yes, she stopped by
late in the afternoon.

592
00:48:21,123 --> 00:48:21,949
Remember the time?

593
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,089
Well, not to the second.

594
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:26,571
She came in around two,
and left around 3:30.

595
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:28,306
Then again,
that isn't so late, is it?

596
00:48:28,396 --> 00:48:29,306
What'd she want?

597
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:30,933
She was looking
for information.

598
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:32,164
That I'm sure of.

599
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:33,674
Do you happen to know
what that information was?

600
00:48:33,764 --> 00:48:34,674
Well, sure.

601
00:48:34,764 --> 00:48:36,465
- Well?
Well, what?

602
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:37,622
Must we play games?

603
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:38,931
I didn't know we were.

604
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:40,917
What was miss lawton
looking for in the files?

605
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:42,915
Oh, well, why didn't you
ask that in the first place

606
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:45,003
instead of all
your chit-chat?

607
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,131
She was looking over
the real estate files

608
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:51,432
in October, November
and December of 1948.

609
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:54,014
In particular, the sale
of the old willows place,

610
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:55,552
out on lake marsh.

611
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:57,693
Did she find what
she was looking for?

612
00:48:57,783 --> 00:49:00,695
Well I guess she did. At least,
she found the sales notice.

613
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:02,777
I saw it myself
after she rushed out.

614
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:05,395
She left the paper open
at the November 26th date.

615
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:06,161
Wanna see it?

616
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,403
Why, very much.

617
00:49:07,493 --> 00:49:10,050
Well, it's right up there.
I haven't had time to put it back yet.

618
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:18,771
Yeah, Dr. Eric vornoff.

619
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,849
Give me all you have on him.

620
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,074
I'll hang on.

621
00:49:34,213 --> 00:49:36,178
Are we ready for the girl?

622
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:34,018
Here.

623
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:36,970
Oh, lovely.

624
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:40,697
Strap her to the table.

625
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:44,208
Do as I command you.

626
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,347
I'll teach you to disobey.

627
00:51:49,727 --> 00:51:51,225
You will obey.

628
00:51:52,372 --> 00:51:53,819
Strap her in.

629
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,008
Strap her in, I command you.

630
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:53,570
Get the equipment ready.

631
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:09,676
It will hurt just for a moment,

632
00:53:10,473 --> 00:53:13,380
and then you will emerge a woman

633
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:16,352
of super strength and beauty.

634
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:19,382
The bride of the atom.

635
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:21,391
You are insane.

636
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:22,694
My paper knows where I am.

637
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:24,861
You can't hurt me
and get away with it.

638
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,979
As soon as my experiments
are completed,

639
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:30,040
no one can ever touch me,

640
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,671
I will make the law.

641
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:36,672
Either way,
whether I succeed or fail,

642
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:39,723
it will not
hurt you very long.

643
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:42,234
Let me go! Let me go!

644
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,349
You heard what she said.

645
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:48,846
Who are you?

646
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:50,117
For one thing, the police.

647
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,020
Now turn her loose
and make it fast.

648
00:53:53,411 --> 00:53:55,743
You have the advantage
for the moment.

649
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,831
Stop talking
and turn her loose.

650
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:06,914
Dick.

651
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:09,395
Take him out, quickly.

652
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:42,934
Where's lieutenant Craig?

653
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:44,704
We found strowski's
car down the road.

654
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:46,212
Lieutenant took off
through the swamp.

655
00:54:46,302 --> 00:54:48,092
Sent me down here to
the beach to wait for him.

656
00:54:48,182 --> 00:54:48,992
Where was he heading?

657
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:50,116
Old willows place.

658
00:54:50,206 --> 00:54:51,614
- Kelton.
Yes, sir.

659
00:54:51,704 --> 00:54:53,138
Now, this is
your first time out.

660
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:55,495
- Don't mess up the operation.
Yes, sir.

661
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,208
I mean no, sir.

662
00:54:57,592 --> 00:54:58,997
martin,
you stay with me.

663
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,160
Yes, sir.

664
00:55:00,407 --> 00:55:01,412
Come on.

665
00:55:09,408 --> 00:55:11,316
I'm sure my experiments

666
00:55:11,406 --> 00:55:12,814
on the young lady
will interest you.

667
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:15,139
I'll live to see you hang.

668
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,252
There are much more
important things to attend.

669
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:37,702
I hope the straps
are not cutting.

670
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:42,354
Such lovely skin
should not be marred.

671
00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:22,093
Lobo, stop.

672
00:56:22,654 --> 00:56:25,833
Stop. Stop, I command!

673
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:30,851
Stop!

674
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:08,417
easy, Janet.

675
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:44,403
Janet, get me the gun.

676
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:49,704
Easy.

677
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,252
I've gotta stop him.

678
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,249
You can't, he'll kill you.

679
00:59:12,339 --> 00:59:13,961
He probably will anyway.

680
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:21,024
Stay here.

681
00:59:23,151 --> 00:59:24,404
Turn that thing off.

682
01:00:40,653 --> 01:00:41,774
Lobo!

683
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:46,406
No! No!

684
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:48,933
Stop.

685
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:51,028
I beg you!

686
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:05,881
stop!

687
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,791
Kelton,
you station yourself here.

688
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,563
You men surround the house.

689
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:42,705
martin, you come with me.

690
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:43,916
All right, captain.

691
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:47,307
- Ready?
Right.

692
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:57,187
look, the place is on fire.

693
01:03:57,277 --> 01:03:59,390
Let's get out of here
before we get roasted.

694
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:08,276
Ca... captain, look!

695
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:19,362
What do you suppose
that was?

696
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:20,859
Well, whatever
it is, get it.

697
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:22,957
Oh, wait a minute.
Here comes dick.

698
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:28,446
He's got Janet.

699
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:29,580
Get him!

700
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:32,019
No, don't shoot!
You might hit Janet.

701
01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:33,208
Let's go.

702
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:42,660
- Marty.
Yeah?

703
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,749
Give me a gun.

704
01:04:43,975 --> 01:04:45,235
Here you go.

705
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,739
There he goes!

706
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,158
Can I suggest
something, captain?

707
01:05:15,248 --> 01:05:17,155
No!
Now get on up over that ledge.

708
01:05:17,245 --> 01:05:18,218
Get up over on top of him.

709
01:05:18,308 --> 01:05:19,481
That's what I was gonna suggest.

710
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:20,481
Well, stop the chattering.

711
01:05:20,571 --> 01:05:22,068
- Get in action.
Yes, sir.

712
01:05:28,572 --> 01:05:30,221
Now he's clear.
Give it to him.

713
01:06:43,527 --> 01:06:45,525
I think it's broken.
Don't move, buddy.

714
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:03,630
he tampered in god's domain.
