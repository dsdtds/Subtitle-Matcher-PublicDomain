00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:19,915
Spirituality is a particular term which
actually means: a dealing with intuition.

3
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:31,354
In the theistic tradition there is
a notion of clinging into a word.

4
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:41,843
A certain act is regarded as
displeasing to a divine principle...

5
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:48,281
A certain act is regarded as
pleasing for the divine... whatever.

6
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,044
In the tradition of non-theism,
however, it is very direct...

7
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,653
that the case histories are
not particularly important.

8
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:04,795
What is actually important
is Here and Now.

9
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,734
Now is definitely now.

10
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:13,942
We try to experience what is
available there... on the spot.

11
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:22,982
There is no point in thinking that a
past did exist that we could have now.

12
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:29,391
This is now.
This very moment.

13
00:01:30,628 --> 00:01:34,325
Nothing mystical, just 'Now',
very simple, straightforward.

14
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:42,931
And from that Now-ness, however,
arises a sense of intelligence always

15
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:50,148
that you are constantly
interacting with reality one by one.

16
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,021
Spot by spot.
Constantly.

17
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,884
We actually experience
fantastic precision, always.

18
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:06,155
But we are threatened by the Now so
we jump to the past or the future.

19
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:14,927
Paying attention to the materials
that exist in our life...

20
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:17,219
such rich life that we lead

21
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:22,146
all these choices take
place all the time...

22
00:02:22,214 --> 00:02:25,412
but none of them are
regarded as bad or good per se.

23
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:29,793
Everything we experience
are unconditional experiences.

24
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:33,093
They don't come along
with a label saying

25
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:35,824
'this is regarded as bad'
or 'this is good'.

26
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:42,289
But we experience them but we don't
actually pay heed to them properly.

27
00:02:42,324 --> 00:02:46,500
We don't actually regard
that we are going somewhere.

28
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:47,604
We regard that
as a hassle.

29
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:55,112
Waiting to be dead.

30
00:02:55,182 --> 00:03:03,521
Waiting to be dead.

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,857
That is a problem. That is not
trusting the Now-ness properly;

32
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:17,664
that what is actually experienced Now
possesses a lot of powerful things.

33
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,673
It is so powerful
that we can't face it.

34
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:27,407
Therefore,
we have to borrow from the past

35
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,391
and invite the future
all the time.

36
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:34,987
And maybe that's
why we seek religion.

37
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:40,353
Maybe that's why
we march in the street.

38
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:45,293
Maybe that's why
we complain to society.

39
00:03:46,168 --> 00:03:50,629
Maybe that's why
we vote for the presidents.

40
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,009
It is quite ironical...

41
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:57,412
Very funny indeed.

The more you begin to investigate...
What we think we understand,

44
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,644
where we came from,
what we think we're doing,

45
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,243
the more you begin to see
we've been lied to.

46
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:26,552
We've been lied to
by every institution.

47
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:29,425
What makes you think for one minute
that the religious institution

48
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,286
is the only one that's
never been touched?

49
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:38,795
The religious institutions of this
world are at the bottom of the dirt.

50
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,894
The religious institutions in this
world are put there by the same people

51
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,786
who gave you your government,
your corrupt education,

52
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,500
who set up your
international banking cartels.

53
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:57,467
Because our masters don't give
a damn about you or your family.

54
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:01,036
All they care about is what
they have always cared about

55
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,060
and that's controlling
the whole damn world.

56
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:10,489
We have been misled away from the true
and divine presence in the universe

57
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,224
that men have called God.

58
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,706
I don't know what God is
but I know what he isn't,

59
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:21,022
and unless and until you are
prepared to look at the whole truth,

60
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:24,567
and wherever it may go,
whoever it may lead to,

61
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:28,090
if you want to look the other way
or if you want to play favorites,

62
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,270
then somewhere along the line
you're going to find out

63
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,819
you're messing with
divine justice.

64
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:38,193
The more you educate yourself, the more
you understand where things come from

65
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:42,417
the more obvious things become and
you begin to see lies everywhere.

66
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:46,503
You have to know the truth and seek the
truth and the truth will set you free.

67
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,795
Because I gotta tell you the truth,
folks, I gotta tell you the truth.

68
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:53,580
When it comes to bullshit,
big-time, major league bullshit,

69
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,844
you have to stand in awe,

70
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,790
of the all-time champion of false
promises and exaggerated claims--

71
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,917
Religion.

72
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:05,447
Think about it.

73
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:08,992
Religion has actually
convinced people that

74
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:13,174
there's an invisible man
living in the sky

75
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,099
who watches everything you do,
every minute of every day.

76
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,332
And the invisible man
has a special list

77
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:22,096
of ten things he does
not want you to do.

78
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:28,080
And if you do any of these ten things,
he has a special place, full of fire

79
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,782
and smoke and burning
and torture and anguish,

80
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,309
where he will send you to live
and suffer

81
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:35,609
and burn and choke
and scream and cry

82
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:38,214
forever and ever
'til the end of time!

83
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:43,190
But He loves you.

84
00:12:53,937 --> 00:13:00,377
He loves you, and he needs money!
He always needs money!

85
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,976
He's all-powerful, all-perfect,
all-knowing, and all-wise,

86
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,875
somehow
just can't handle money!

87
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:14,008
Religion takes in billions of dollars,
they pay no taxes,

88
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,110
and they always need
a little more.

89
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:22,661
Now, you talk about a good
bullshit story. Holy Shit!

90
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:04,412
This is the sun.

91
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:07,356
As far back as 10 thousand B.C.,

92
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,831
history is abundant
with carvings and writings

93
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,681
reflecting peoples respect
and adoration for this object.

94
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,967
And it is simple to understand why
as every morning the sun would rise,

95
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:21,497
bringing vision, warmth, and security,
saving man from the cold, blind,

96
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:23,328
predator-filled darkness of night.

97
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:28,004
Without it, the cultures understood
the crops would not grow,

98
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,935
and life on the planet
would not survive.

99
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:34,940
These realities made the sun the
most adored object of all time.

100
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:40,550
Likewise, they were also
very aware of the stars.

101
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:43,476
The tracking of the stars
allowed them to recognize

102
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:46,489
and anticipate events which
occurred over long periods of time,

103
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:48,787
such as eclipses and full moons.

104
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,764
They in turn
catalogued celestial groups

105
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,586
into what we know
today as constellations.

106
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,518
This is the
cross of the Zodiac,

107
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:02,200
one of the oldest conceptual
images in human history.

108
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,902
It reflects the sun as
it figuratively passes

109
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,509
through the 12 major constellations
over the course of a year.

110
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:12,382
It also reflects the
12 months of the year,

111
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:15,954
the 4 seasons,
and the solstices and equinoxes.

112
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,927
The term Zodiac
relates to the fact that

113
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:24,684
constellations were anthropomorphized,
or personified, as figures, or animals.

114
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:29,241
In other words, the early civilizations
did not just follow the sun and stars,

115
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,699
they personified them
with elaborate myths

116
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:34,055
involving their movements
and relationships.

117
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,885
The sun, with its life-giving
and life-saving qualities

118
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,393
was personified
as a representative

119
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,941
of the unseen creator,
or God.

120
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:45,853
"God's Sun," the light of the world,
the savior of human kind.

121
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,733
Likewise,
the 12 constellations

122
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:51,265
represented places of
travel for God's Sun

123
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,708
and were identified by names,
usually representing

124
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:55,960
elements of nature that happened
during that period of time.

125
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,394
For example, Aquarius, the water bearer,
who brings the Spring rains.

126
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:06,427
This is Horus.

127
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:10,836
He is the Sun God of Egypt
of around 3000 BC.

128
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:13,670
He is the sun,
anthropomorphized, and his life

129
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,978
is a series of allegorical myths
involving the sun's movement in the sky.

130
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:21,749
From the ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt,
we know much about this solar messiah.

131
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:25,285
For instance, Horus,
being the sun, or the light,

132
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,458
had an enemy known as Set,
and Set was the

133
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:31,465
personification of
the darkness or night.

134
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,367
And metaphorically speaking, every
morning Horus would win the battle

135
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,823
against Set;
while in the evening,

136
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:40,966
Set would conquer Horus and
send him into the underworld.

137
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,644
It is important to note
that "dark vs. light"

138
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,193
or "good vs. evil" is
one of the most ubiquitous

139
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:51,040
mythological dualities
ever known and is

140
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,853
still expressed on
many levels to this day.

141
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,590
Broadly speaking, the story
of Horus is as follows:

142
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,732
Horus was born on December
25th of the virgin Isis-Meri.

143
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:06,315
His birth was accompanied
by a star in the east,

144
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,866
and upon his birth,
he was adored by three kings.

145
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:13,504
At the age of 12, he was
a prodigal child teacher,

146
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,327
and at the age of 30
he was baptized by a

147
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,880
figure known as Anup and
thus began his ministry.

148
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:21,097
Horus had 12 disciples
he traveled about with,

149
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:23,678
performing miracles such as healing
the sick and walking on water.

150
00:17:24,437 --> 00:17:27,021
Horus was known
by many gestural names such as

151
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:29,359
The Truth, The Light,
God's Anointed Son,

152
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:32,385
The Good Shepherd, The Lamb of God,
and many others.

153
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:36,671
After being betrayed by Typhon,
Horus was crucified,

154
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,894
buried for 3 days,
and thus, resurrected.

155
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:46,502
These attributes of Horus, whether
original or not, seem to permeate

156
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:49,507
in many cultures of the world, for
many other Gods are found to have

157
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,613
the same
general mythological structure.

158
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:54,958
Attis, of Phrygia,
born of the virgin Nana

159
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:57,673
on December 25th,
crucified, placed in a tomb

160
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,919
and after 3 days,
was resurrected.

161
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:04,257
Krishna, of India,
born of the virgin Devaki

162
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,365
with a star in the east
signaling his coming,

163
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:08,947
he performed miracles
with his disciples,

164
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,999
and upon his death
was resurrected.

165
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:19,087
Dionysus of Greece, born of a virgin on
December 25th, was a traveling teacher

166
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:21,613
who performed miracles such
as turning water into wine,

167
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,930
he was referred to as
the "King of Kings,"

168
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:26,448
"God's Only Begotten Son,"
"The Alpha and Omega,"

169
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:28,695
and many others,
and upon his death,

170
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,082
he was resurrected.

171
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:34,403
Mithra, of Persia, born of
a virgin on December 25th,

172
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:37,165
he had 12 disciples
and performed miracles,

173
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,378
and upon his death was buried for 3 days
and thus resurrected,

174
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,969
he was also referred to as

175
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:43,768
"The Truth," "The Light,"
and many others.

176
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:47,865
Interestingly, the sacred day
of worship of Mithra was Sunday.

177
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,955
The fact of the matter is
there are numerous saviors,

178
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,205
from different periods,

179
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,114
from all over the world, which subscribe
to these general characteristics.

180
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:01,124
The question remains:

181
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:05,157
Why these attributes, why the
virgin birth on December 25th,

182
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:07,812
why dead for three days and
the inevitable resurrection,

183
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,152
why 12 disciples or followers?

184
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:14,934
To find out, let's examine the
most recent of the solar messiahs.

185
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,161
Jesus Christ was born
of the virgin Mary on

186
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:22,584
December 25th in Bethlehem,
his birth was announced

187
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,843
by a star in the east,
which three kings or magi

188
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,166
followed to locate and
adore the new savior.

189
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,199
He was a child teacher at 12,
at the age of 30

190
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,263
he was baptized by
John the Baptist,

191
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:33,045
and thus began his ministry.

192
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,780
Jesus had 12 disciples
which he traveled about

193
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:37,861
with performing miracles
such as healing the sick,

194
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:40,564
walking on water, raising the dead,
he was also known

195
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,214
as the "King of Kings,"
the "Son of God,"

196
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,705
the "Light of the World,"
the "Alpha and Omega,"

197
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,066
the "Lamb of God,"
and many others.

198
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,436
After being betrayed by
his disciple Judas and

199
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,130
sold for 30 pieces of
silver, he was crucified,

200
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:54,766
placed in a tomb and after 3 days was
resurrected and ascended into Heaven.

201
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:03,251
First of all, the birth sequence
is completely astrological.

202
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:06,701
The star in the east is Sirius,
the brightest star

203
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:09,052
in the night sky,
which, on December 24,

204
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,601
aligns with the 3 brightest
stars in Orion's Belt.

205
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:16,131
These 3 bright stars are
called today what they

206
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,436
were called in ancient times:
The Three Kings.

207
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,804
And the Three Kings and the
brightest star, Sirius,

208
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:27,277
all point to the place of
the sunrise on December 25th.

209
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:31,865
This is why the Three Kings "follow"
the star in the east, in order

210
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,111
to locate the sunrise...
the birth of the sun.

211
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,641
The Virgin Mary is the
constellation Virgo,

212
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,504
also known as
Virgo the Virgin.

213
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,963
Virgo in Latin
means virgin.

214
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:51,668
Virgo is also referred
to as the House of Bread,

215
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:55,574
and the representation of Virgo is
a virgin holding a sheaf of wheat.

216
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:58,359
This House of Bread
and its symbol of wheat

217
00:20:58,394 --> 00:21:00,978
represents August and September,
the time of harvest.

218
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:06,083
In turn, Bethlehem, in fact, literally
translates to "house of bread".

219
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:09,778
Bethlehem is thus a reference
to the constellation Virgo,

220
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,717
a place in the sky,
not on Earth.

221
00:21:13,158 --> 00:21:15,335
There is another very
interesting phenomenon

222
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,295
that occurs around December 25th,
or the winter solstice.

223
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,927
From the summer solstice
to the winter solstice,

224
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,601
the days
become shorter and colder.

225
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,903
And from the perspective of
the northern hemisphere,

226
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:28,237
the sun appears to move south
and get smaller and more scarce.

227
00:21:28,508 --> 00:21:30,704
The shortening of the
days and the expiration

228
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,363
of the crops when approaching
the winter solstice

229
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:36,383
symbolized the process
of death to the ancients.

230
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:38,545
It was the death of the Sun.

231
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:45,025
And by December 22nd, the Sun's
demise was fully realized,

232
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,842
for the Sun, having moved
south continually for 6 months,

233
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:51,163
makes it to it's lowest point
in the sky.

234
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,962
Here a curious thing
occurs:

235
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:59,707
The Sun stops moving south,
at least perceivably, for 3 days.

236
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:02,657
And during this 3 day pause,
the Sun resides

237
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:07,683
in the vicinity of the Southern Cross,
or Crux, constellation.

238
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:11,621
And after this time on
December 25th, the Sun

239
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:14,739
moves 1 degree,
this time north,

240
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,260
foreshadowing longer days,
warmth, and Spring.

241
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,797
And thus it was said:
the Sun died on the cross,

242
00:22:22,832 --> 00:22:27,461
was dead for 3 days,
only to be resurrected or born again.

243
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:31,138
This is why Jesus and
numerous other Sun Gods

244
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:36,145
share the crucifixion, 3-day
death, and resurrection concept.

245
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,333
It is the Sun's transition
period before it shifts

246
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:41,867
its direction back into
the Northern Hemisphere,

247
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,552
bringing Spring,
and thus salvation.

248
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:48,276
However, they did not celebrate
the resurrection of the Sun

249
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:50,851
until the spring equinox,
or Easter.

250
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,429
This is because
at the spring equinox,

251
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:56,566
the Sun officially
overpowers the evil darkness,

252
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,817
as daytime thereafter
becomes longer in duration

253
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:04,907
than the night, and the revitalizing
conditions of spring emerge.

254
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:09,580
Now, probably the most obvious of all
the astrological symbolism around Jesus

255
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,425
regards the 12 disciples.

256
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:14,485
They are simply the
12 constellations of the Zodiac,

257
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,013
which Jesus, being the Sun,
travels about with.

258
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:25,026
In fact, the number 12 is
replete throughout the Bible.

259
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,519
Coming back
to the cross of the Zodiac,

260
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:34,072
the figurative life of the Sun,

261
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:40,823
this was not just an artistic expression
or tool to track the Sun's movements.

262
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:46,976
It was also a Pagan spiritual symbol,
the shorthand of which looked like this.

263
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,270
This is not
a symbol of Christianity.

264
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:55,893
It is a Pagan adaptation
of the cross of the Zodiac.

265
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:11,663
This is why Jesus in early occult art is
always shown with his head on the cross,

266
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:15,918
for Jesus is the Sun,
the "Sun of God",

267
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,207
the "Light of the World",
the "Risen Savior",

268
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:22,319
who will "come again,"
as it does every morning,

269
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:27,582
the "Glory of God" who defends
against the "works of darkness",

270
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:30,665
as he is "born again"
every morning,

271
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,164
and can be seen
"coming in the clouds,"

272
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:42,137
"up in Heaven," with his
"Crown of Thorns," or sun rays.

273
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,512
Now, of the many
astrological-astronomical metaphors

274
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:53,633
in the Bible,
one of the most important

275
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:55,281
has to do with the ages.

276
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:59,795
Throughout the scripture there are
numerous references to the "Age."

277
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,649
In order to understand this,

278
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:03,745
we need to be familiar
with the phenomenon

279
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:06,362
known as the
Precession of the Equinoxes.

280
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,262
The ancient Egyptians
along with cultures

281
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:12,111
long before them recognized
that approximately every

282
00:25:12,146 --> 00:25:14,913
2150 years,
the sunrise on the morning

283
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:18,681
of the spring equinox would occur
at a different sign of the Zodiac.

284
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,829
This has to do with a
slow angular wobble that

285
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:25,281
the Earth maintains
as it rotates on it's axis.

286
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:29,238
It is called a precession because
the constellations go backwards,

287
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:31,025
rather than through
the normal yearly cycle.

288
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,862
The amount of time
that it takes for

289
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:35,053
the precession to go
through all 12 signs

290
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:38,724
is roughly 25,765 years.

291
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,237
This is also called
the "Great Year,"

292
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:44,733
and ancient societies
were very aware of this.

293
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:49,606
And they referred to each 2150
year period as an "age."

294
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:56,087
From 4300 B.C. to 2150 B.C.,
it was the Age of Taurus, the Bull.

295
00:25:56,122 --> 00:26:00,858
From 2150 BC to 1 AD.,
it was the Age of Aries, the Ram

296
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:05,095
and from 1 AD. to 2150 AD.
it is the Age of Pisces,

297
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,859
the age we are still
in to this day.

298
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:12,196
And in and around 2150,
we will enter the new age.

299
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,067
The Age of Aquarius.

300
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,890
Now, the Bible reflects,
broadly speaking,

301
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:21,410
a symbolic movement
through 3 ages,

302
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:23,039
while foreshadowing a 4th.

303
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,746
In the Old Testament,
when Moses comes

304
00:26:25,781 --> 00:26:27,820
down Mount Sinai with
the 10 Commandments,

305
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:32,280
he is very upset to see his people
worshiping a golden bull calf.

306
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,610
In fact,
he shattered the stone tablets

307
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:39,398
and instructed his people to kill each
other in order to purify themselves.

308
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,648
Most Biblical scholars
would attribute this anger

309
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:45,816
to the fact that the Israelites
were worshiping a false idol,

310
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:46,839
or something
to that effect.

311
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:49,531
The reality is
that the golden bull

312
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:54,381
is Taurus the Bull, and Moses represents
the new Age of Aries the Ram.

313
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,883
This is why Jews even today
still blow the Ram's horn.

314
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:03,105
Moses represents the new Age of Aries,
and upon the new age,

315
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,086
everyone must shed
the old age.

316
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:09,707
Other deities mark these
transitions as well, such as Mithra

317
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:13,789
a pre-Christian God who kills
the bull, in the same symbology.

318
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:19,163
Now Jesus is the figure who
ushers in the age following Aries,

319
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:21,766
the Age of Pisces,
or the Two Fish.

320
00:27:22,877 --> 00:27:26,863
Fish symbolism is very
abundant in the New Testament,

321
00:27:26,898 --> 00:27:30,850
as Jesus feeds 5000 people
with bread and "2 fish."

322
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:34,926
When he begins his ministry
walking along Galilee,

323
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,824
he befriends 2 fishermen,
who follow him.

324
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:40,412
And I think
we've all seen the

325
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:42,431
Jesus-fish on the
backs of people's cars.

326
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:45,058
Little do they know
what it actually means.

327
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,449
It is a Pagan astrological
symbolism for

328
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,198
the Sun's Kingdom
during the Age of Pisces.

329
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:59,244
Also, Jesus' assumed birth date is
essentially the start of this age.

330
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:04,938
At Luke 22:10 when Jesus
is asked by his disciples

331
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:08,685
where the last passover
would be, Jesus replies:

332
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,163
"Behold, when ye are
entered into the city, there

333
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:15,437
shall a man meet you
bearing a pitcher of water...

334
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:18,531
follow him into the house
where he entereth in."

335
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,649
This scripture is
by far one of the most

336
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,714
revealing of all the
astrological references.

337
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:27,646
The man bearing a pitcher
of water is Aquarius,

338
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:32,644
the water-bearer, who is always pictured
as a man pouring out a pitcher of water.

339
00:28:33,217 --> 00:28:36,201
He represents
the age after Pisces,

340
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:40,458
and when the Sun (God's Sun)
leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus),

341
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:42,458
it will go into the House of Aquarius,

342
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:45,691
as Aquarius follows Pisces in
the precession of the equinoxes.

343
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:49,556
All Jesus is saying is that
after the Age of Pisces

344
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:51,402
will come
the Age of Aquarius.

345
00:28:56,173 --> 00:29:00,649
Now, we have all heard about the
end times and the end of the world.

346
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:04,449
The cartoonish depictions
in the Book of Revelation,

347
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:08,585
the main source of this idea
comes from Matthew 28:20,

348
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,190
where Jesus says: "I will be with
you even to the end of the world."

349
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,414
However,
in King James Version,

350
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:19,927
"world" is a mistranslation,
among many mistranslations.

351
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:25,432
The actual word being used is "aeon",
which means "age."

352
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:28,907
"I will be with you even
to the end of the age."

353
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:34,038
Which is true, as Jesus' Solar
Piscean personification will end when

354
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,598
the Sun enters
the Age of Aquarius.

355
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:40,206
The entire concept of end
times and the end of the world

356
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,856
is a misinterpreted
astrological allegory.

357
00:29:42,891 --> 00:29:46,019
Let's tell that
to the approximately

358
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,426
100 million people in America who
believe the end of the world is coming.

359
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:53,784
Furthermore,
the character of Jesus,

360
00:29:53,785 --> 00:29:56,280
being a literary
and astrological hybrid,

361
00:29:56,315 --> 00:30:01,708
is most explicitly a plagiarization
of the Egyptian Sun-God Horus.

362
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:06,118
For example,
inscribed about 3500 years ago,

363
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,345
on the walls of the
Temple of Luxor in Egypt

364
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,164
are images of the enunciation,
the miracle conception,

365
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:16,949
the birth,
and the adoration of Horus.

366
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:20,505
The images begin with
Thaw announcing to the virgin Isis

367
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,961
that she will conceive
Horus,

368
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:25,699
then Nef the holy ghost
impregnating the virgin,

369
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:29,403
and then the virgin birth
and the adoration.

370
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:34,131
This is exactly the story of
Jesus' miracle conception.

371
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:37,963
In fact,
the literary similarities between

372
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,884
the Egyptian religion and the
Christian religion are staggering.

373
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:54,863
And the plagiarism is
continuous.

374
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:59,067
The story of Noah and Noah's Ark
is taken directly from tradition.

375
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:02,669
The concept of a Great Flood is
ubiquitous throughout the ancient world,

376
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:06,236
with over 200 different cited claims
in different periods and times.

377
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:09,096
However,
one need look no further for

378
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:11,716
a pre-Christian source
than the Epic of Gilgamesh

379
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,378
written in 2600 B.C.

380
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:18,695
This story talks of a Great Flood
commanded by God,

381
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,040
an Ark
with saved animals upon it,

382
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:24,891
and even the release
and return of a dove,

383
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:27,164
all held in common
with the biblical story,

384
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:30,065
among many other similarities.

385
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:34,688
And then there is the
plagiarized story of Moses.

386
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,507
Upon Moses' birth,
it is said that he was placed

387
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:42,462
in a reed basket and set adrift in
a river in order to avoid infanticide.

388
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:47,382
He was later rescued by a daughter of
royalty and raised by her as a Prince.

389
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:51,381
This baby in a basket story
was lifted directly

390
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,540
from the myth of Sargon of Akkad,
of around 2250 B.C.

391
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:59,334
Sargon was born,
placed in a reed basket,

392
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:03,094
in order to avoid infanticide,
and set adrift in a river.

393
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:07,533
He was in turn rescued and
raised by Akki, a royal mid-wife.

394
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:10,825
Furthermore,
Moses is known as the Law Giver,

395
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:13,476
the giver of the Ten Commandments,
the Mosaic Law.

396
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:16,328
However, the idea of a
Law being passed from God

397
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:20,313
to a prophet, up on a mountain,
is also a very old motif.

398
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:25,317
Moses is just a law giver in a long line
of law givers in mythological history.

399
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:28,294
In India,
Manou was the great law giver.

400
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:32,697
In Crete, Minos ascended Mount Dicta,
where Zeus gave him the sacred laws.

401
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:36,335
While in Egypt there was Mises,
who carried stone tablets

402
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,573
and upon them,
the laws of God were written.

403
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:44,708
Manou, Minos,
Mises, Moses.

404
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:46,712
And as far
as the Ten Commandments,

405
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:50,985
they are taken outright from Spell 125
of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

406
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,452
What the
Book of the Dead phrased

407
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:55,406
"I have not stolen" became
"Thou shall not steal,"

408
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:58,291
"I have not killed" became
"Thou shall not kill,"

409
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:01,899
"I have not told lies" became
"Thou shall not bare false witness",

410
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,632
and so forth.

411
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:06,132
In fact,
the Egyptian religion is likely

412
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:10,870
the primary foundational basis for the
Judeo-Christian theology.

413
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:15,232
Baptism, afterlife,
final judgement, virgin birth,

414
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,713
death and resurrection,
crucifixion,

415
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:20,482
the ark of the covenant,
circumcision,

416
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:23,417
saviors, holy communion,
the great flood,

417
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:27,736
Easter, Christmas, Passover,
and many many more,

418
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:30,459
are all attributes of
Egyptian ideas,

419
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:33,327
long pre-dating
Christianity and Judaism.

420
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:36,147
Justin Martyr,
one of the first Christian

421
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:39,293
historians and defenders,
wrote:

422
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:42,772
"When we say that he,
Jesus Christ, our teacher,

423
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,709
was produced without sexual union,
was crucified

424
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:48,529
and died, and rose again,
and ascended into Heaven,

425
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:51,314
we propound nothing different
from what

426
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:55,683
you believe regarding those who
you esteem Sons of Jupiter."

427
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:58,587
In a different writing,
Justin Martyr said:

428
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,570
"He was born of a virgin,
accept this in common,

429
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:03,761
with what you believe
of Perseus."

430
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:08,900
It's obvious that Justin and other early
Christians knew how similar Christianity

431
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:11,267
was to the
Pagan religions.

432
00:34:11,302 --> 00:34:13,368
However,
Justin had a solution.

433
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:18,142
As far as he was
concerned, the Devil did it.

434
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:21,357
The Devil had the foresight
to come before Christ,

435
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,537
and create these characteristics
in the Pagan world.

436
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,987
Fundamentalist Christianity,
fascinating.

437
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:34,652
These people actually believe
the World is 12,000 years old.

438
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,432
I actually asked one of these guys:
"OK, dinosaur fossils?"

439
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:47,896
He says: "Dinosaur fossils?
God put those here to test our faith!"

440
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:56,279
"I think God put you here
to test my faith, dude!"

441
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:04,757
The Bible is nothing more than an
astro-theological literary hybrid,

442
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,861
just like nearly all
religious myths before it.

443
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:10,328
In fact,
the aspect of transference,

444
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:12,866
of one character's attributes
to a new character,

445
00:35:12,867 --> 00:35:15,369
can be found
within the book itself.

446
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,272
In the Old Testament,
there's the story of Joseph.

447
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:21,571
Joseph
was a prototype for Jesus.

448
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:26,241
Joseph was born of a miracle birth,
Jesus was born of a miracle birth.

449
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:30,216
Joseph was of 12 brothers,
Jesus had 12 disciples.

450
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:34,620
Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver,
Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver.

451
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:38,387
Brother "Judah" suggests
the sale of Joseph,

452
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:42,119
disciple "Judas" suggests
the sale of Jesus.

453
00:35:42,497 --> 00:35:47,068
Joseph began his work at the age of 30,
Jesus began his work at the age of 30.

454
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,434
The parallels go
on and on.

455
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:53,217
Furthermore, is there any
non-Biblical historical evidence

456
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,745
of any person,
living with the name Jesus,

457
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,780
the Son of Mary,
who traveled about with 12 followers,

458
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:00,214
healing people
and the like?

459
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:02,717
There are numerous historians
who lived in

460
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:05,186
and around the Mediterranean
either during or soon

461
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,712
after the assumed life of Jesus.

462
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,093
How many of these historians
document this figure?

463
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,754
Not one.

464
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:16,197
However, to be fair,
that doesn't mean defenders

465
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:19,333
of the Historical Jesus
haven't claimed the contrary.

466
00:36:19,368 --> 00:36:23,240
Four historians are typically
referenced to justify Jesus's existence.

467
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:26,944
Pliny the younger, Suetonius,
Tacitus are the first three.

468
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:29,177
Each one of their entries
consists of only a few

469
00:36:29,212 --> 00:36:33,364
sentences at best and only refer
to the Christus or the Christ,

470
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:37,059
which in fact is not name but a title.
It means the Anointed One.

471
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,696
The fourth source is
Josephus

472
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:44,222
and this source has been proven to
be a forgery for hundreds of years.

473
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:46,743
Sadly,
it is still cited as truth.

474
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,819
You would think that a guy
who rose from the dead

475
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,438
and ascended into Heaven
for all eyes to see

476
00:36:55,473 --> 00:36:58,142
and performed the wealth of miracles
acclaimed to him

477
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:00,812
would have made it into
the historical record.

478
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,613
It didn't because once
the evidence is weighed,

479
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:08,382
there are very high odds that the figure
known as Jesus, did not even exist.

480
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:26,127
We don't want to be unkind,
but we want to be factual.

481
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:32,011
We don't want to cause hurt feelings,
but we want to be academically correct,

482
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:34,640
in what we understand
and know to be true.

483
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:39,417
Christianity
just is not based on truth.

484
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:42,907
We find that Christianity
was in fact nothing more

485
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:47,231
than a Roman story,
developed politically.

486
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:55,935
The reality is, Jesus was the Solar
Deity of the Gnostic Christian sect,

487
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,071
and like all other Pagan Gods,
he was a mythical figure.

488
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:02,942
It was the political establishment
that sought

489
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:07,513
to historize the Jesus figure
for social control.

490
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:14,353
By 325 AD. in Rome, Emperor Constantine
conviened the Council of Nicea,

491
00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:15,684
It was
during this meeting that

492
00:38:15,704 --> 00:38:19,261
the politically motivated
Christian Doctrines were established

493
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:24,297
and thus began a long history of
Christian bloodshed and spiritual fraud.

494
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:26,131
And for the next
1600 years,

495
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:31,506
the Vatican maintained a political
stranglehold on all of Europe,

496
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:34,839
leading to such joyous periods
as the Dark Ages,

497
00:38:35,377 --> 00:38:40,644
along with enlightening events such
as the Crusades, and the Inquisition.

498
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:47,778
Christianity, along with all
other theistic belief systems,

499
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:50,092
is the fraud of the age.

500
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:55,798
It serves to detach the species from the
natural world, and likewise, each other.

501
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,767
It supports blind
submission to authority.

502
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:03,439
It reduces human responsibility to the
effect that "God" controls everything,

503
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:09,496
and in turn awful crimes can be
justified in the name of Divine Pursuit.

504
00:39:09,531 --> 00:39:15,519
And most importantly, it empowers those
who know the truth but use the myth

505
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:18,821
to manipulate and control societies.

506
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,292
The religious myth is the most
powerful device ever created,

507
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,729
and serves
as the psychological soil

508
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:29,894
upon which other myths
can flourish.

509
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:37,800
A myth is an idea that,
while widely believed, is false.

510
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:45,091
In a deeper sense,
in the religious sense,

511
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:49,519
a myth serves as an orienting
and mobilizing story for people.

512
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,655
The focus is not on the story's relation
to reality but on its function.

513
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:02,641
A story cannot function,
unless it is believed to be true

514
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:04,988
in the community
or the nation.

515
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:10,504
It is not a matter of debate
if some people have the bad taste

516
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:14,367
to raise the question of
the truth of the sacred story.

517
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,604
The keepers of the faith do not
enter into the debate with them.

518
00:40:17,316 --> 00:40:21,370
They ignore them,
or denounce them as blasphemers.

519
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:24,129
It is wrong, blasphemous
and sinful for you

520
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,456
to suggest,
imply or help other people

521
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,944
to come to conclusion
that the U.S. Government

522
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:30,642
killed 3,000
of its own citizens.

523
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,042
As if a demolition team
set off,

524
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:20,240
when you do the demolition
of an old building.

525
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:22,549
It looks like one of those scenes
of an old building

526
00:41:22,584 --> 00:41:24,786
being purposely dynamited
and blown up.

527
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:27,666
Anybody who ever watched
a building being demolished,

528
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:29,855
on purpose, knows that if
you're going to do this

529
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,821
you have to get the under-infrastructure
of the building and bring it down.

530
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:35,461
The way the structure
is collapsing...

531
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,189
This was the result of something
that was planned.

532
00:41:38,224 --> 00:41:42,166
It's not accidental that the
first tower just happened to collapse

533
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,888
and then the second tower just happened
to collapse in exactly the same way.

534
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:48,399
How they accomplished this,
we don't know.

535
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:50,741
The building
collapsed to dust.

536
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:55,376
You don't find a desk,
you don't find a chair,

537
00:41:55,411 --> 00:41:58,367
you don't find a telephone
or computer.

538
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:03,133
The biggest piece of a telephone I found
was half of the keypad,

539
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:04,190
and it was about this big.

540
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:06,196
What happened
to the concrete?

541
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,630
The concrete was pulverized.

542
00:42:07,665 --> 00:42:09,633
From river to river,

543
00:42:09,634 --> 00:42:12,027
this dust powder,
two or three inches thick,

544
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:15,401
The concrete was just uh...
pulverized!

545
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:19,075
Reminiscence of pictures
we've all seen too much in TV before,

546
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,773
a building is deliberately destroyed by
well placed dynamite to knock it down.

547
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:26,780
It's as if they had detonators,
yes, detonators,

548
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:29,651
planted to take down the building,
boom, boom, boom!

549
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:31,216
I heard a second explosion.

550
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,184
There was a heavy-duty explosion.

551
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:36,036
There was a secondary explosion
and then a subsequent collapse.

552
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:38,934
...explosion blow and then
it knocked everybody over.

553
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:40,549
To me it sounded like an explosion.

554
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:43,085
It sounded like gun-fire,
bang-bang-bang.

555
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,493
And then all of a sudden,
three big explosions.

556
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:47,201
...and we heard big explosion
coming down.

557
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:48,773
...and then the entire top
of the building just blew up.

558
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,100
We saw
some kind of explosion.

559
00:42:50,376 --> 00:42:51,934
...by the force of the explosions...

560
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,509
- ...big explosion...
- It blew us back into the 8th floor...

561
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:57,714
...then we got to lobby,
there was a big explosion.

562
00:42:57,749 --> 00:42:59,374
The lobby looked as though,
a bomb had exploded there.

563
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:03,137
...huge explosion,
now raining debris...

564
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:05,213
...there's been a huge explosion...

565
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:06,715
...huge explosion that
we all heard and felt.

566
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,033
We just witnessed some
kind of explosion...

567
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,934
...it was very loud... it blasted...
explosion...

568
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:17,095
...smoke and secondary
explosion in Tower 1...

569
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,828
...that is another bomb
going off...

570
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:21,207
He thinks that there
were actually devices

571
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:22,924
that were planted
in the building...

572
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:24,297
...planted in the building...

573
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,863
I don't think anybody
could have predicted

574
00:44:06,898 --> 00:44:09,448
that they would try to use
an airplane as a missile,

575
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,324
a hijacked airplane
as a missile.

576
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:12,739
...nobody in our government at least,

577
00:44:12,774 --> 00:44:14,535
and I don't think the prior government
could have envisioned

578
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,661
flying airplanes
into the buildings.

579
00:44:15,899 --> 00:44:19,385
No specific threats involving,
really domestic operations

580
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:22,872
involving what happened obviously,
the cities, airlines and so on.

581
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:26,568
There were no warning
signs that I am aware of.

582
00:44:26,876 --> 00:44:31,245
USAToday reports that in the two years
before the attacks on September 11th

583
00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:36,981
NORAD conducted exercises using
hijacked airliners as weapons.

584
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,712
And one target was
the World Trade Center.

585
00:44:50,868 --> 00:44:53,558
In confidential documents
from the Philippines

586
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:55,568
obtained by CNN,
the plan was clear:

587
00:44:55,841 --> 00:44:59,390
He would board any American
commercial aircraft,

588
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:02,939
control its cockpit, and dive
it at the CIA headquarters.

589
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,616
Other buildings targeted
the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.

590
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:10,876
Security and counter-terrorism
was blinking red,

591
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:11,952
in the words of
George Tenet,

592
00:45:12,257 --> 00:45:16,402
that the warnings of an
imminent attack were so severe,

593
00:45:16,437 --> 00:45:18,163
that something dramatic
should have been done.

594
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:19,858
It was unparalleled.

595
00:45:20,098 --> 00:45:23,397
Instead, our president went
on a month long vacation?

596
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:36,843
The head of Pakistani Intelligence
of the ISI, Mahmood Ahmed

597
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:42,053
requested Omar Sheikh
to wire $100,000

598
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:44,217
to Mohammed Atta,
who was the lead hijacker.

599
00:45:44,252 --> 00:45:48,985
...hijacker Mohammed Atta received
wire transfers via Pakistan.

600
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,766
The man sending the money
to Atta is

601
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:53,332
believed to be
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.

602
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,968
Omar Sheikh admitted
he was supported by

603
00:45:57,003 --> 00:45:59,295
the Pakistani Government's
Intelligence service; the ISI.

604
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:23,250
Although we are told that 4 or 5
of the alleged hijackers

605
00:46:23,285 --> 00:46:24,734
were on each of the flights,

606
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:26,725
if so their names should have
been on the flight manifest.

607
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:30,321
But the flight manifest
that had been released

608
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:32,910
contained neither the names
of the alleged hijackers

609
00:46:32,945 --> 00:46:35,125
nor any
Arab names whatsoever.

610
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,987
We know that the men who
were supposedly the hijackers

611
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:42,261
had their houses, cars, credit cards
paid for by the U.S. Government.

612
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:44,268
They were, in truth,
agents.

613
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:46,676
Evidence was also
apparently planted.

614
00:46:46,711 --> 00:46:49,285
The passport of
one of the hijackers on

615
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,692
Flight 11 was allegedly
found in the rubble.

616
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:54,460
...it goes through the fireball,
through the side of the plane

617
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:56,750
and comes down
on the ground unscathed.

618
00:46:56,785 --> 00:46:58,255
But something happened.

619
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,109
For 6 months they reported
they had this passport...

620
00:47:01,144 --> 00:47:02,871
"Boy, we got it,
we got the proof"

621
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,021
and then the guy stood up
and was alive.

622
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:08,425
Several of these 19 men
are still alive.

623
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:44,470
Of course we're after Saddam Hussein,
I mean bin Laden, he's, he's, he's...

624
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:46,151
January 2001.

625
00:47:46,332 --> 00:47:51,635
The Bush Administration orders
the FBI and intelligence agencies

626
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,695
to back off investigations
involving the bin Laden family,

627
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,226
including two of
Osama bin Laden's relatives

628
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:02,616
who were living, guess where?
In Falls Church, Virginia,

629
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:03,695
right next to CIA headquarters.

630
00:48:04,136 --> 00:48:06,366
When he was already America's
"most wanted criminal"

631
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:11,320
he reportedly spent two weeks in
the American hospital in Dubai,

632
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:16,127
was treated by an American doctor
and visited by the local CIA agent,

633
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:20,893
We have not seen one piece of
evidence that links Osama bin Laden

634
00:48:20,928 --> 00:48:23,711
directly to the planning stages
of September 11th.

635
00:48:23,746 --> 00:48:27,183
This failure to provide proof
was later said to be unnecessary

636
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:30,723
because bin Laden in the video
allegedly found in Afghanistan,

637
00:48:30,758 --> 00:48:33,176
admitted responsibility
for the attacks.

638
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:35,097
This confession is now
widely cited as proof.

639
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:38,614
But the man in this
video has darker skin,

640
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,481
fuller cheeks
and a broader nose

641
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:42,737
than the Osama bin Laden
of all other videos.

642
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:45,216
We again seem to have
the planted evidence.

643
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:50,614
In 1976, Osama's older brother,
Saleem bin Laden,

644
00:48:50,649 --> 00:48:53,964
hired a man in Texas
by the name of Jim Bath

645
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:57,056
to handle all the investments in the
United States for the bin Laden family.

646
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:01,752
Jim Bath also happens to be a personal,
almost life-long friend

647
00:49:01,787 --> 00:49:04,549
and former international guard pilot,
with George W. Bush.

648
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:07,719
The connections between the
Bushes and the bin Ladens

649
00:49:07,754 --> 00:49:09,665
become much more
clearer when

650
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,803
George Herbert Walker Bush made
trips to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 2000

651
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:17,620
to meet
with the bin Laden family

652
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,943
on behalf of the company
called the Carlyle Group.

653
00:49:46,596 --> 00:49:50,917
How could anyone fly a 60 ton,
125 ft wide,

654
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:54,309
44 ft tall plane
through this obstacle course.

655
00:49:54,344 --> 00:49:56,379
The aircraft,
before striking the Pentagon,

656
00:49:56,399 --> 00:50:00,483
reportedly executed a
270 degree downward spiral

657
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:05,158
and yet Hani Hanjour
was known as a terrible pilot

658
00:50:05,193 --> 00:50:08,168
who could not safely fly,
even a small plane.

659
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:24,108
No seats, no luggage, no bodies.
Nothing but bricks and limestone.

660
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:27,049
The official explanation is that
the intense heat

661
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:29,346
from the jet fuel
vaporized the entire plane.

662
00:50:29,381 --> 00:50:33,653
Flight 77 had two Rolls Royce engines
made of steel and titanium alloy

663
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:35,198
and weighed 6 tons each.

664
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:37,379
It is scientifically impossible

665
00:50:37,479 --> 00:50:41,188
that 12 tons of steel and titanium
was vaporized by jet fuel.

666
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:44,457
We're also told that the bodies
were able to be identified

667
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:48,005
either by the
fingerprints or by the DNA.

668
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,053
So what kind of fire can vaporize
aluminum and tempered steel

669
00:50:53,088 --> 00:50:56,355
and yet leave
human bodies intact?

670
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,386
From my close-up inspection,
there's no evidence of a plane

671
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:02,291
having crashed anywhere
near the Pentagon

672
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:05,784
and as I say the only
pieces left that you can see

673
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,118
are small enough that you
can pick up in your hand.

674
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:09,312
Shortly after the strike,

675
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:11,593
government agents picked up
debris and carried it off.

676
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:15,703
The entire lawn was covered
with dirt and gravel

677
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:18,734
so that any remaining
forensic evidence

678
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:20,169
was literally covered up.

679
00:51:20,204 --> 00:51:24,871
The videos from security cameras which
would show what really hit the Pentagon

680
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:27,812
were immediately confiscated
by agents of the FBI.

681
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,747
And the Department of Justice has to
this day, refused to release them.

682
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:36,918
If these videos would prove that
the Pentagon was really hit by a 757,

683
00:51:37,697 --> 00:51:40,224
most of us would assume
the Government would release them.

684
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:56,143
It looks like there's nothing there
except for a hole in the ground.

685
00:51:56,478 --> 00:51:57,604
Basically,
that's right.

686
00:51:57,913 --> 00:52:00,866
The only thing you could see
from where we were, uh, was

687
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:02,612
a big gouge in the earth
and some broken trees.

688
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:06,244
You could see some people working,
walking around in the area,

689
00:52:06,888 --> 00:52:09,186
but from where we can see
there wasn't much left.

690
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,183
Any large pieces of debris
at all?

691
00:52:11,459 --> 00:52:12,751
No, there was nothing.

692
00:52:12,973 --> 00:52:16,362
Nothing, that you can distinguish
that a plane had crashed there.

693
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,951
Pancake theory,
according to which the fires,

694
00:52:44,986 --> 00:52:46,022
although not
melting the steel,

695
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,602
heated up sufficiently to cause the
floors weakened by the airplane strikes

696
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:54,334
to break loose from the steel columns,
and this started a chain reaction.

697
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:58,077
So, you would expect then from that
theory, which is the official theory,

698
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:01,933
to see a whole stack of floors
piled up on top of each other

699
00:53:01,968 --> 00:53:04,143
and then a spindle of core columns
standing too.

700
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:08,782
The core of each of the Twin Towers
consisted of 47 massive steel columns.

701
00:53:09,365 --> 00:53:10,917
If the floors had
broken loose from them,

702
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:14,556
these columns would have still been
sticking up in the air a thousand feet.

703
00:53:15,227 --> 00:53:17,787
The plane did not cut
all those core columns.

704
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:22,917
We designed the buildings
to take the impact of the Boeing 707,

705
00:53:23,459 --> 00:53:26,103
hitting the building
at any location.

706
00:53:26,138 --> 00:53:30,932
The building probably could sustain
multiple impacts of jetliners.

707
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,575
...that the plane flew
straight into the building.

708
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:34,806
Straight through, right.

709
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:36,563
So you're saying
that the building

710
00:53:36,564 --> 00:53:39,309
was actually designed to cope
with a hole like that

711
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,110
- and would still survive?
- Yes, it was.

712
00:53:41,687 --> 00:53:44,640
If you would drop,
say a billiard ball

713
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:48,019
from the top of the World Trade Center,
110 floors up there

714
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:50,856
it would have taken 8 to 10 seconds
to hit the ground,

715
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:52,662
encountering no resistance
whatsoever.

716
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:55,498
The Twin Towers came down
in nearly free fall speed.

717
00:53:56,035 --> 00:54:00,496
200,000 tons of steel shatters
and explodes outwards over 500 ft.

718
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:04,112
This means that floors shattered
at an average rate

719
00:54:04,147 --> 00:54:05,868
of about
ten floors per second.

720
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:09,440
There is no scenario for a
pancake effect of buildings falling

721
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:11,480
that allows them to fall
at a rate of free fall.

722
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:14,554
And what can do that? What
can move mass out of the way?

723
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:16,123
Explosives.

724
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:27,629
47 huge steel columns going up
the core that are interconnected,

725
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,530
how do you get them to fail
simultaneously so the core disappeared.

726
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:34,932
It looks like
those core columns were cut.

727
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,969
The way we do this is by
cutting the beam at an angle.

728
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:58,894
I started looking
at the molten metal.

729
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:02,398
All three buildings,
both towers in the rubble,

730
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,767
in the basement areas,
and Building 7

731
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:07,141
there were
these pools of molten metal.

732
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:21,377
You get down below and
you see molten steel.

733
00:55:22,049 --> 00:55:24,420
Molten steel
running down the channel rails.

734
00:55:25,062 --> 00:55:28,998
Like you were in a foundry.
Like lava of a volcano.

735
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:33,188
The molten steel was found
'three, four and five weeks later

736
00:55:33,188 --> 00:55:34,984
when the rubble
was being removed.'

737
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:38,736
He said that molten steel was also
found underneath World Trade Center 7.

738
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:41,427
So I'm looking through
the official reports,

739
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:43,323
what do they say about
the molten metal?

740
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:44,909
They say nothing.

741
00:55:45,883 --> 00:55:48,613
Wait a minute.
This is important evidence.

742
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:50,277
Where did that come from?

743
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,966
Thermite is so hot
that it'll just cut through steel,

744
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:58,888
through the structural steel,
for example,

745
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:00,561
like a knife through butter.

746
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:05,457
The products are molten iron
and aluminum oxide

747
00:56:05,492 --> 00:56:07,604
which goes off primarily
as a dust.

748
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,936
You know,
those enormous dust clouds

749
00:56:11,443 --> 00:56:14,435
you can imagine, when you assemble
these chemicals on a large scale.

750
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:35,068
Molten metal pools under both towers
after they collapsed, and Building 7.

751
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,593
Now, Building 7 wasn't even
hit by a jet.

752
00:56:38,772 --> 00:56:42,230
Part of the problem is that most people
simply don't know much about Building 7.

753
00:56:42,676 --> 00:56:45,702
due to the extraordinary secrecy
surrounding its collapse.

754
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,673
This was a
47 story skyscraper.

755
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:52,518
This building fell at 17:25.

756
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:54,045
It was not hit by a plane.

757
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:57,824
This building had fires
on only 2 or 3 floors.

758
00:56:58,124 --> 00:57:02,288
...and it was brought down by what
we know was a controlled demolition.

759
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:04,964
Demolitions look just like that,
kink in the middle,

760
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:08,633
and then that building just comes
straight down almost at free fall speed.

761
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,504
They first blow
one of the central columns

762
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:13,464
so the building falls in
on itself.

763
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:16,710
Building 7
had a classic crimp or wedge.

764
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:18,876
Its central column
was blown out first

765
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:22,775
so it didn't structurally damaged
buildings just a few feet away from it.

766
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,329
Our office
was on the B-1 level.

767
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:47,119
As I was talking to a supervisor
at 8.46

768
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:51,325
and all of a sudden,
we hear, boom!

769
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:55,074
An explosion so hard
that pushed us upwards.

770
00:57:56,419 --> 00:58:00,618
And it came from the basement,
between the B-2 level and the B-3 level.

771
00:58:01,425 --> 00:58:04,755
And when I went to verbalize,
we heard boom!

772
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,465
That impact
of the plane on the top.

773
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:10,996
As I'm walking by the main freight car
of the building in the corridor,

774
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,539
that's when I got blown.

775
00:58:15,072 --> 00:58:19,065
I mean, the impact of the
explosion threw me to the floor

776
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:20,873
and that's when everything
started happening.

777
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:22,677
All of a sudden,
a big impact happened again

778
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:25,322
and all the ceiling tiles
were falling down,

779
00:58:25,357 --> 00:58:26,678
the light fixtures
were falling...

780
00:58:26,984 --> 00:58:30,751
You know, you gotta go clear across
the whole from 1 to 2 World Trade Center

781
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:33,318
and then all of a sudden,
it happened all over again.

782
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:36,957
Something else hit us to the floor...
right in the basement you felt it,

783
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:39,195
the walls were caving in on,
everything that was going on.

784
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:42,599
I mean, I know people that
got killed in the basement,

785
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:45,199
I know people that got
broken legs in the basement,

786
00:58:45,537 --> 00:58:48,665
people got reconstructive surgery
because the walls hit them in the face.

787
00:58:58,718 --> 00:59:00,505
According to
standard operating procedure,

788
00:59:00,556 --> 00:59:03,121
if an FAA flight control
notices anything

789
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,980
that suggests a possible hijacking,

790
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,849
controllers are to
contact the superior.

791
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:09,127
If the problem cannot be
fixed within about a minute

792
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:12,694
the superior should ask NORAD
(North American Aerospace Command)

793
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,991
to send up or scramble jet fighters
to find out what is going on.

794
00:59:16,435 --> 00:59:18,500
NORAD then issues
a scramble order to

795
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:20,565
the nearest air force base,
with fighters on alert.

796
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,641
And although interceptions usually
occur within 10 or so minutes,

797
00:59:24,944 --> 00:59:28,460
in this case,
80 or so minutes had elapsed

798
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:30,110
before the fighters
were even airborne.

799
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:32,448
It's a mind-bending anomaly.

800
00:59:32,886 --> 00:59:37,152
Not a single US Air Force interceptor
turns a wheel until it's too late.

801
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:39,420
There are no jets at all.

802
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,337
What if they were
so confused,

803
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:46,134
and had been so deliberately confused
that they couldn't respond?

804
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:49,002
The reason that they
didn't know where to go

805
00:59:49,037 --> 00:59:51,784
was because a number of
conflicting and overlapping

806
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:54,532
war game exercises
were taking place

807
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:57,727
that involved the insertion
of false radar blips

808
00:59:57,975 --> 01:00:01,000
on the radar screens in the
north-east air defense sector.

809
01:00:13,996 --> 01:00:16,445
There was another exercise;
"Vigilant Warrior",

810
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,895
which was in fact,
according to a NORAD source,

811
01:00:19,234 --> 01:00:22,260
a live-fly hijack drill
being conducted at the same time.

812
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:26,965
With only 8 available fighter aircrafts,
and that have to be dispatched in pairs,

813
01:00:27,026 --> 01:00:32,345
they were dealing with as many as 22
possible hijacks on the day of 9/11

814
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:37,381
and they couldn't separate the war
game exercises from the actual hijacks.

815
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:05,948
Page 172:

816
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:08,463
"The US Government has
not been able to determine

817
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,943
the origin of the money
used for the 9/11 attacks.

818
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:14,151
Ultimately, the question is of
little practical significance."

819
01:01:14,692 --> 01:01:16,910
The American authorities
have not managed

820
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,129
to trace
the source of the funding.

821
01:01:19,498 --> 01:01:22,549
And then the most amazingly
disingenuous statement,

822
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:25,203
"Ultimately is it of
little consequence".

823
01:01:25,238 --> 01:01:27,564
It is of
massive consequence!

824
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:29,340
Doesn't it matter
who paid for 9/11?

825
01:01:29,774 --> 01:01:32,442
The collapse of Building 7
has been recognized

826
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:35,111
as especially
difficult to explain.

827
01:01:35,414 --> 01:01:38,297
The 9/11 Commission Report
implicitly admitted

828
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:41,181
that it could not explain the
collapse of this building

829
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,148
by not even mentioning it.

830
01:01:43,588 --> 01:01:45,564
Mr. President,
why are you and the Vice President

831
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:48,649
insisting on appearing together
before the 9/11 Commission?

832
01:01:49,128 --> 01:01:52,120
Because the 9/11 Commission wants to ask
us questions, that's why we are meeting,

833
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:55,997
and I look forward to meeting with
them and answering their questions.

834
01:01:56,169 --> 01:01:58,219
The question was:
Why are you appearing together,

835
01:01:58,259 --> 01:02:00,450
rather than separately,
which was their request?

836
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:03,677
Because it's a good chance
for both of us

837
01:02:03,707 --> 01:02:06,106
to answer questions
that the 9/11 Commission

838
01:02:06,513 --> 01:02:10,677
is looking forward to asking us, and
I am looking forward to answering them.

839
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:15,809
Do you think they should be able to
stand up and speak their own words?

840
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:17,049
They should go under oath.

841
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,289
- They should be--
- Yeah. In public.

842
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,935
Don't you think that
the families deserve

843
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:37,287
to have a transcript
or to be able to see--

844
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:39,866
Adam, you asked me
this question yesterday,

845
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,714
I got the same answer.
Yeah.

846
01:02:42,617 --> 01:02:44,754
The final report
was a unanimous report.

847
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:46,780
That means that if
there was a single commissioner

848
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,438
who had any objection
about anything,

849
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:51,937
that fact would be
dropped from the report.

850
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:55,133
We have found out that
he not only served on

851
01:02:55,134 --> 01:02:57,867
the transition team
of the Bush Administration,

852
01:02:58,131 --> 01:03:01,412
that he was a person
who wrote a draft memo for the

853
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:04,251
setup of the Bush Administration's
National Security Council,

854
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:07,502
that he was an individual who
wrote the preemptive war strategy

855
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,820
that was eventually
used for the war on Iraq,

856
01:03:09,872 --> 01:03:12,059
that he's a close friend
of Condoleezza Rice's...

857
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,881
We want him to resign.

858
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:17,799
There is literally nothing
in the 9/11 report

859
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,313
that the Bush Administration
did not approve of.

860
01:03:21,091 --> 01:03:24,890
We can understand therefore why that
commission under Zelikow leadership

861
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,731
would have ignored all the evidence
that would point to the truth

862
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:31,865
that 9/11
was a false flag operation

863
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:35,486
intended to authorize the doctrines
and funds needed

864
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:38,604
for a new level of
imperial mobilization.

865
01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:59,197
Armed with knives. Armed with chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.

866
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:01,816
Fanatics. Terrorists. September 11th.
September 11th. Killers.

867
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:04,491
September 11th. Terrorists.
Terrorists. Al Qaeda, Terrorists.

868
01:04:04,526 --> 01:04:07,132
Nuclear weapons. Terror. 9/11.
Terror. Terror. Terror. Evil.

869
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:11,543
September 11th. September 11th.
The terrorists. War and danger.

870
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:15,047
September 11th. Terrorism.
Global terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorist.

871
01:04:15,082 --> 01:04:18,081
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist,
Terrorist. The terrorists.

872
01:04:18,116 --> 01:04:22,120
Terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorism.
September 11th. Global terrorism.

873
01:04:22,155 --> 01:04:26,125
Terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorists.
September 11th. World terrorism.

874
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,650
Terrorists. Terrorism.
September 11th. Global Terrorism.

875
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:31,331
September the 11th. Terrorist.
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist,

876
01:04:31,366 --> 01:04:34,098
Terrorist. Weapons of mass destruction.
September the 11th.

877
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:38,898
September the 11th. Terrorists. The evil
terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorists know!

878
01:04:38,933 --> 01:04:42,450
Terrorism. The words are
hypnotically repeated:

879
01:04:42,485 --> 01:04:45,616
Terrorism. Terrorists.
Terrorist threat.

880
01:04:45,617 --> 01:04:48,748
And of course,
believe-to-be-linked-to-al-Qaeda.

881
01:04:49,294 --> 01:04:52,873
But, it's the so-called
"War on Terrorism"

882
01:04:52,908 --> 01:04:54,449
that's in our faces,
practically 24/7

883
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:57,290
as the inescapable focus
of our existence.

884
01:04:57,558 --> 01:05:02,689
One day, our grandchildren will
look back on this time and ask:

885
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:04,785
"How was
the war on terror won?"

886
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,103
The entire US ruling class,
ruling elite

887
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:13,049
comes to see terrorism as the
preferred means, indeed the only means,

888
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:15,643
to provide social cohesion,

889
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:19,275
to provide an enemy image for
the society, to keep it together.

890
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,663
According to NeoCon Theory
from Carl Schmitt,

891
01:05:20,714 --> 01:05:22,429
you have to have
an enemy image,

892
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:23,894
in order
to have a society.

893
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:27,268
A very dangerous thing because now
it means that the entire social order,

894
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:30,419
the political parties, intellectual life,
politics in general,

895
01:05:30,454 --> 01:05:32,858
are all based
on a monstrous myth.

896
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:09,834
Look, what the CIA has
done in this country.

897
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:12,090
What they have done to us
is unbelievable.

898
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:14,453
Look at the terrorist acts
that have occurred.

899
01:06:14,488 --> 01:06:15,431
The CIA behind most,
if not, all of them.

900
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,973
We had the Marine Barracks,
then embassy in Kenya,

901
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:25,757
We had Pan Am 103,
we had the USS Cole,

902
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:30,372
we had Oklahoma City, we had
the World Trade Center in 1993.

903
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:35,254
...that helped the terrorists
to blow up the WTC the first time.

904
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:37,120
They built the bomb,
they got the driver's license.

905
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:41,616
The informer
Emad A. Salem,

906
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:44,727
a 43-year-old former
Egyptian Army officer,

907
01:06:44,762 --> 01:06:47,993
he was given the assignment
to put the bomb together

908
01:06:48,028 --> 01:06:50,492
and he went to the supervisor,
that's the FBI supervisor,

909
01:06:50,527 --> 01:06:52,679
and he said,
"We're gonna put a dummy bomb" right?

910
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:55,928
and the FBI supervisor says
"No, we're gonna put a real bomb."

911
01:06:55,963 --> 01:07:01,557
The FBI actually carried out the attack
on the World Trade Center in 1993.

912
01:07:01,592 --> 01:07:06,301
They actually hired Emad Salem
and paid him 1 million dollars

913
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:10,766
and gave him real explosives,
a detonator and told him to build a bomb

914
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:13,726
and to give it to the foolish people
that he was controlling

915
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:17,232
to allow them to attack
the World Trade Center complex.

916
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:22,447
Unfortunately for them,
there were only six people killed,

917
01:07:22,482 --> 01:07:24,156
not enough
to pass the legislation.

918
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:26,754
So, what happened
is two years later,

919
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:32,269
April 19, 1995 down comes
Oklahoma City, the Murrah Building,

920
01:07:32,304 --> 01:07:37,077
168 people killed... one year later,
the anti-terror legislation,

921
01:07:37,112 --> 01:07:38,662
which takes away
many of our constitutional rights

922
01:07:38,682 --> 01:07:40,422
and civil liberties,
is passed.

923
01:08:12,192 --> 01:08:13,936
It was at half past 9
this morning.

924
01:08:13,971 --> 01:08:16,906
We were actually running an exercise
for a company

925
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:17,939
of over a thousand people
in London

926
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:21,117
based on simultaneous bombs
going off precisely

927
01:08:21,152 --> 01:08:22,824
at the railway stations
where it happened this morning,

928
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:25,586
so I still have the hairs on the back
of my neck standing up right!

929
01:08:25,621 --> 01:08:28,626
To get this quite straight,
you were running an exercise

930
01:08:28,661 --> 01:08:30,266
to see how you would
cope with this

931
01:08:30,301 --> 01:08:32,025
and it happened
while you were running the exercise?

932
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:32,955
Precisely.

933
01:08:38,955 --> 01:08:41,642
We're supposed to believe it
was some kind of coincidence.

934
01:08:41,677 --> 01:08:45,943
There was also an anti-terrorist
drill going on on 7/7.

935
01:08:45,978 --> 01:08:48,186
And again,
just like on 9/11,

936
01:08:48,221 --> 01:08:52,710
they were talking about attacks on the
same targets, the same tube stations

937
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:56,684
at the exactly the same time
as the actual attack happened

938
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,849
providing some
kind of cover for what

939
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,979
must be operations orchestrated
in some way by the State.

940
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:37,074
I am absolutely appalled at how much
people in this country do not think.

941
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:45,516
We are given to understand that an
Arabic guy out there up in the mountains

942
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:49,677
financed the most elaborate
attack on this country.

943
01:09:49,712 --> 01:09:56,239
Do you think some people in a cave
were able to have NORAD stand down?

944
01:09:56,274 --> 01:10:01,125
Do you think that people in the cave
were able to have all of this happen?

945
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:06,276
And when I think about how many
Americans were killed in New York City

946
01:10:06,311 --> 01:10:10,719
and believing as I do that
this thing was a set up job,

947
01:10:10,754 --> 01:10:14,431
this is a textbook operation
that Nazis used

948
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:17,540
and they've used it
over and over again.

949
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:21,086
America has been suckered in
one more time.

950
01:10:24,822 --> 01:10:28,827
I don't have to tell you things are bad.
Everybody knows things are bad.

951
01:10:28,862 --> 01:10:32,097
The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
Banks are going bust,

952
01:10:32,132 --> 01:10:34,392
shopkeepers keep a gun
under the counter.

953
01:10:34,427 --> 01:10:36,498
Punks are running wild
in the streets.

954
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:38,230
There's nobody anywhere who
seems to know what to do,

955
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:39,193
and there's no end to it.

956
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:44,780
We know the air is unfit to breathe
and our food is unfit to eat.

957
01:10:44,815 --> 01:10:48,834
We sit watching our TVs
while some local newscaster tells us

958
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:52,152
that today we had
15 homicides and 63 violent crimes

959
01:10:52,187 --> 01:10:53,967
as if that's the way
it's supposed to be!

960
01:10:54,002 --> 01:10:57,750
We know things are bad.
Worse than bad. They're crazy.

961
01:10:57,785 --> 01:10:59,594
It's like everything everywhere
is going crazy,

962
01:10:59,629 --> 01:11:00,977
so we don't go out anymore.

963
01:11:01,012 --> 01:11:04,560
We sit in the house and slowly the world
we're living in is getting smaller.

964
01:11:04,595 --> 01:11:08,177
And all we say is, "Please, at least
leave us alone in our living rooms.

965
01:11:08,212 --> 01:11:11,735
Let me have my toaster and my TV,
my steel-belted radials

966
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,658
and I won't say anything.
Just leave us alone."

967
01:11:13,693 --> 01:11:16,516
Well I'm not gonna leave you alone.
I want you to get mad!

968
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:20,467
I don't want you to protest,
I don't want you to riot.

969
01:11:20,502 --> 01:11:22,101
I don't want you to
write to your congressman

970
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:22,619
because I wouldn't know
what to tell you to write.

971
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:26,213
I don't know what to do about
the depression and the inflation

972
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,234
and the Russians and
the crime in the street,

973
01:11:28,269 --> 01:11:31,044
All I know is that first
you've got to get mad!

974
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:34,365
You've got to say,
"I'm a human being, goddamn it!

975
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,922
My life has value!

976
01:12:31,163 --> 01:12:32,249
Oh God!

977
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:04,226
"When hostilities
commenced in Europe in 1939

978
01:13:04,497 --> 01:13:08,900
it was realized that the American people
had no intention of entering the war

979
01:13:10,036 --> 01:13:12,581
but they believed that
this country could be enticed

980
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,431
into the war,
in very much the same way,

981
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:17,676
that it was enticed
into the last one

982
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:23,356
They planned, first, to prepare
the United States for foreign war,

983
01:13:23,391 --> 01:13:26,124
under the guise
of American defense

984
01:13:27,623 --> 01:13:33,026
Second, to involve us in the war,
step by step without our realization.

985
01:13:34,095 --> 01:13:37,100
Third,
to create a series of incidences,

986
01:13:37,135 --> 01:13:39,788
which would force us
into the actual conflict.

987
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:44,929
These plans were, of course,
to be covered and assisted

988
01:13:44,964 --> 01:13:47,247
by the full power
of their propaganda,

989
01:13:48,877 --> 01:13:51,962
Our theaters soon became
filled with plays,

990
01:13:51,997 --> 01:13:53,939
portraying
the glory of war.

991
01:13:54,907 --> 01:13:57,914
News reels lost all
semblance of objectivity.

992
01:13:59,055 --> 01:14:03,867
and they have used the war to justify
the restriction of congressional power

993
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:07,433
and the assumption of
dictatorial procedures,

994
01:14:07,468 --> 01:14:09,948
on the part of
the President and his appointees.

995
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:14,662
A fear campaign was inaugurated.

996
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:22,561
We cannot allow the natural passions
and prejudices,

997
01:14:22,562 --> 01:14:26,714
of other peoples,
to lead our country to destruction"

998
01:15:01,906 --> 01:15:06,145
1775, the
American Revolutionary War began,

999
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,677
as the American colonies
sought to detach from England,

1000
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:09,628
and it's oppressive monarchy.

1001
01:15:09,663 --> 01:15:13,075
Although many reasons are
cited for the revolution,

1002
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:16,056
one in particular sticks
out as the prime cause:

1003
01:15:16,064 --> 01:15:21,417
that King George III of England outlawed
the interest free independent currency

1004
01:15:21,452 --> 01:15:24,426
the colonies were producing
and using for themselves,

1005
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:27,374
in turn forcing them
to borrow money from

1006
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:29,842
the Central Bank of England,
at interest,

1007
01:15:29,877 --> 01:15:32,058
immediately putting
the colonies into debt.

1008
01:15:32,093 --> 01:15:34,938
And as Benjamin Franklin
later wrote:

1009
01:15:34,973 --> 01:15:38,154
The refusal of King George III
to allow the colonies

1010
01:15:38,189 --> 01:15:39,707
to operate
an honest money system,

1011
01:15:39,742 --> 01:15:42,978
which freed the ordinary man from
the clutches of the money manipulators

1012
01:15:43,013 --> 01:15:46,268
was probably
the prime cause of the revolution.

1013
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:49,744
In 1783, America won its independence
from England.

1014
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:53,522
However, its battle against the
central bank concept and the corrupt,

1015
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:56,033
greed-filled men associated with it,
had just begun.

1016
01:15:57,592 --> 01:15:59,027
So what is a Central Bank?

1017
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:01,613
A Central Bank
is an institution

1018
01:16:01,648 --> 01:16:03,963
that produces the currency
of an entire nation.

1019
01:16:03,998 --> 01:16:07,370
Based on historical precedent,
two specific powers

1020
01:16:07,405 --> 01:16:09,474
are inherent in
central banking practice.

1021
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:12,387
The control of interest rates,
and the

1022
01:16:12,422 --> 01:16:14,962
control of the money supply,
or inflation.

1023
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:18,851
The central bank does not simply supply
a government's economy with money,

1024
01:16:18,886 --> 01:16:21,235
it loans it to them
at interest.

1025
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:25,680
Then, through the use of increasing
and decreasing the supply of money,

1026
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:29,641
the central bank regulates the
value of the currency being issued.

1027
01:16:30,432 --> 01:16:34,556
It is critical to understand that
the entire structure of this system

1028
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:37,670
can only produce one thing
in the long run:

1029
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:39,215
Debt.

1030
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,907
It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity
to figure this scam out.

1031
01:16:42,942 --> 01:16:48,136
For every single dollar produced by the
central bank is loaned at interest.

1032
01:16:48,171 --> 01:16:51,690
That means every single dollar
produced is actually the dollar,

1033
01:16:51,725 --> 01:16:55,282
plus a certain percent of debt
based on that dollar.

1034
01:16:55,317 --> 01:16:58,203
And since a central bank
has a monopoly

1035
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,890
over the production of the currency
for the entire country,

1036
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:05,913
and they loan each dollar out
with immediate debt attached to it,

1037
01:17:06,258 --> 01:17:08,766
where does the money to
pay for the debt come from?

1038
01:17:09,287 --> 01:17:11,848
It can only come from
the central bank again.

1039
01:17:11,883 --> 01:17:15,430
Which means the central bank
has to perpetually increase

1040
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:19,364
its money supply to temporarily cover
the outstanding debt created,

1041
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:23,518
which in turn, since that new money
is loaned out at interest as well,

1042
01:17:23,553 --> 01:17:25,124
creates even more debt!

1043
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:28,806
The end result of this system
without fail is slavery.

1044
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:31,775
For it is impossible for the government
and thus the public,

1045
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:34,932
to ever come out of the
self-generating debt.

1046
01:17:34,967 --> 01:17:38,243
The founding fathers of this country
were well aware of this.

1047
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:09,569
By the early 20th century,
the US had already implemented,

1048
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:11,981
and removed a few
central banking systems,

1049
01:18:12,016 --> 01:18:15,515
which were swindled into place
by ruthless banking interests.

1050
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:19,487
At this time, the dominant families
in the banking and business world were:

1051
01:18:19,522 --> 01:18:24,567
the Rockefellers, the Morgans,
the Warburgs, the Rothschilds.

1052
01:18:24,602 --> 01:18:28,429
And in the early 1900's,
they sought to push once again,

1053
01:18:28,484 --> 01:18:32,031
legislation to create
another central bank,

1054
01:18:32,753 --> 01:18:34,091
However,
they knew the government

1055
01:18:34,092 --> 01:18:36,485
and public were weary
of such an institution.

1056
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:40,379
So they needed to create
an incident to affect public opinion.

1057
01:18:40,414 --> 01:18:45,045
So, J.P. Morgan, publicly considered
a financial luminary at the time,

1058
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,941
exploited his mass influence
by publishing rumors

1059
01:18:48,976 --> 01:18:51,522
that a prominent bank in New York
was insolvent, or bankrupt.

1060
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:55,355
Morgan knew this would
cause mass hysteria

1061
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:58,432
which would affect other banks
as well, and it did.

1062
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:01,010
The public,
in fear of losing their deposits,

1063
01:19:01,045 --> 01:19:03,451
immediately began
mass withdrawals.

1064
01:19:03,486 --> 01:19:06,540
Consequently, the banks were
forced to call in their loans,

1065
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,684
causing the recipients
to sell their property,

1066
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,880
and thus a spiral of bankruptcies,
repossessions, and turmoil emerged.

1067
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,524
Putting the pieces together
a few years later,

1068
01:19:15,559 --> 01:19:17,553
Fredrik Allen of
LIFE Magazine wrote:

1069
01:19:17,588 --> 01:19:21,690
"The Morgan interests took advantage
to precipitate the panic of 1907

1070
01:19:21,725 --> 01:19:24,031
guiding it shrewdly,
as it progressed."

1071
01:19:24,066 --> 01:19:27,665
Unaware of the fraud,
the Panic of 1907 led to

1072
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,990
a Congressional investigation,
headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich,

1073
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,119
who had intimate ties
to the banking cartels,

1074
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,972
and later became part of the
Rockefeller family through marriage.

1075
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:39,714
The Commission led by Aldrich
recommended

1076
01:19:39,749 --> 01:19:41,544
a Central Bank
should be implemented,

1077
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:44,879
so a panic like 1907
"could never happen again".

1078
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:49,484
This was the spark the international
bankers needed to initiate their plan.

1079
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:53,624
In 1910, a secret meeting was
held at a J.P. Morgan estate

1080
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:55,459
on Jekyll Island off
the coast of Georgia.

1081
01:19:55,494 --> 01:19:57,909
It was there that the
central banking bill

1082
01:19:57,944 --> 01:19:59,920
called the Federal Reserve Act
was written.

1083
01:19:59,955 --> 01:20:03,654
This legislation was written by bankers,
not law-makers.

1084
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,158
This meeting
was so secretive,

1085
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,556
so concealed from government
and public knowledge,

1086
01:20:08,591 --> 01:20:10,916
that the 10 or so figures
who attended,

1087
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:13,242
disguised their names
when in route to the island.

1088
01:20:13,277 --> 01:20:16,837
After this bill was constructed,
it was then handed over

1089
01:20:16,872 --> 01:20:19,756
to their political front-man,
Senator Nelson Aldrich,

1090
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:21,233
to push through Congress.

1091
01:20:21,268 --> 01:20:25,776
And in 1913, with heavy political
sponsorship by the bankers,

1092
01:20:25,811 --> 01:20:27,703
Woodrow Wilson
became President,

1093
01:20:27,738 --> 01:20:30,410
having already agreed
to sign the Federal Reserve Act

1094
01:20:30,445 --> 01:20:32,262
in exchange
for campaign support.

1095
01:20:32,297 --> 01:20:35,042
And 2 days before Christmas,
when most of Congress

1096
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:37,994
was at home with their families,
the Federal Reserve Act was voted in,

1097
01:20:38,029 --> 01:20:39,759
and Wilson in turn made it law.

1098
01:20:40,094 --> 01:20:43,386
Later, Woodrow Wilson wrote,
in regret:

1099
01:21:15,174 --> 01:21:18,200
Congressman Louis McFadden
also expressed

1100
01:21:18,235 --> 01:21:20,162
the truth
after the passage of the bill:

1101
01:21:20,197 --> 01:21:22,715
"A world banking system
was being set up here...

1102
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:25,705
a superstate controlled
by international bankers,

1103
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:29,059
acting together to enslave the world
for their own pleasure.

1104
01:21:29,094 --> 01:21:31,021
The Fed has usurped
the government."

1105
01:21:31,847 --> 01:21:34,639
Now, the public was told that
the Federal Reserve System

1106
01:21:34,674 --> 01:21:36,644
was an economic stabilizer.

1107
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:40,569
And inflation and economic crisis
were a thing of the past.

1108
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:44,637
Well, as history has shown,
nothing is further from the truth.

1109
01:21:44,672 --> 01:21:47,037
The fact is the international bankers
now had

1110
01:21:47,087 --> 01:21:50,506
a streamlined machine
to expand their personal ambitions.

1111
01:21:54,048 --> 01:21:57,258
For example,
from 1914 to 1919,

1112
01:21:57,293 --> 01:22:00,313
the Fed increased the
money supply by nearly 100%.

1113
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:04,185
Resulting in extensive loans
to small banks and the public.

1114
01:22:04,527 --> 01:22:07,132
Then in 1920, the Fed called in
massive percentages

1115
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,418
of the outstanding
money supply,

1116
01:22:08,453 --> 01:22:12,629
thus resulting in the supporting banks
having to call in huge numbers of loans,

1117
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:17,955
and just like in 1907: bank runs,
bankruptcy, and collapse occurred.

1118
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:22,772
Over 5400 competitive banks outside of
the Federal Reserve System collapsed.

1119
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:26,680
Further consolidating the monopoly to
a small group of international bankers.

1120
01:22:27,577 --> 01:22:32,126
Privy to this crime, Congressman
Lindberg stepped up, and said in 1921:

1121
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:36,370
"Under the Federal Reserve Act,
panics are scientifically created.

1122
01:22:36,405 --> 01:22:39,450
The present panic is the first
scientifically created one,

1123
01:22:39,485 --> 01:22:41,960
worked out as we figure
a mathematical equation."

1124
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:45,502
However, the panic of
1920 was just a warm-up.

1125
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:50,125
From 1921 to 1929, the Fed again
increased the money supply,

1126
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,766
resulting once again in extensive
loans to the public and banks.

1127
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:55,883
There was also
a fairly new type of loan

1128
01:22:55,918 --> 01:22:57,805
called a margin loan
in the stock market.

1129
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,464
Very simply,
a margin loan allowed an investor

1130
01:23:00,499 --> 01:23:02,590
to put down
only 10% of a stocks price,

1131
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:05,631
with the other 90%
being loaned through the broker.

1132
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:10,208
In other words, a person could own $1000
worth of stock with only $100 down.

1133
01:23:10,243 --> 01:23:13,018
This method was very popular
in the roaring 1920's,

1134
01:23:13,053 --> 01:23:14,922
as everyone seemed to be
making money in the market.

1135
01:23:15,267 --> 01:23:17,227
However,
there was a catch to this loan.

1136
01:23:17,262 --> 01:23:21,624
It could be called in at any time,
and had to be paid within 24 hours.

1137
01:23:21,659 --> 01:23:23,140
This is termed a margin call,

1138
01:23:23,175 --> 01:23:25,405
and the typical result
of a margin call is

1139
01:23:25,406 --> 01:23:27,636
the selling of the stock
purchased with the loan.

1140
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:31,293
So, a few months
before October of 1929,

1141
01:23:31,534 --> 01:23:33,454
J.D. Rockefeller,
Bernard Baruck,

1142
01:23:33,489 --> 01:23:35,862
and other insiders
quietly exited the market,

1143
01:23:35,897 --> 01:23:39,916
and on October 24th, 1929,
the New York financiers who

1144
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:42,490
furnished the margin loans
started calling them in, in mass.

1145
01:23:43,196 --> 01:23:46,976
This sparked an instantaneous
massive sell-off in the market,

1146
01:23:47,011 --> 01:23:48,823
for everyone had to
cover their margin loans.

1147
01:23:48,858 --> 01:23:51,447
It then triggered mass bank runs
for the same reason,

1148
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:54,586
in turn collapsing over
16,000 banks,

1149
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:56,955
enabling the conspiring
international bankers

1150
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,107
to not only buy up rival banks
at a discount,

1151
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:02,317
but to also buy up whole corporations
at pennies on the dollar.

1152
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:04,485
It was the greatest robbery
in American history.

1153
01:24:04,585 --> 01:24:06,221
But that didn't stop there.

1154
01:24:06,256 --> 01:24:10,139
Rather than expand the money supply
to recover from this economic collapse,

1155
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:12,128
the Fed actually
contracted it,

1156
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:14,461
fueling one of the largest
depressions in history.

1157
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:18,232
Once again outraged,
Congressman Louis McFadden,

1158
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,324
a long-time opponent
of the banking cartels,

1159
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:23,533
began bringing impeachment proceedings
against the Federal Reserve Board,

1160
01:24:23,568 --> 01:24:25,192
saying of
the crash and depression:

1161
01:24:25,407 --> 01:24:26,806
"It was a carefully
contrived occurrence.

1162
01:24:27,142 --> 01:24:30,490
International bankers sought to
bring about a condition of despair,

1163
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:32,773
so that they might emerge
the rulers of us all."

1164
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:36,954
Not surprisingly, and after 2
previous assassination attempts,

1165
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,236
McFadden was
poisoned at a banquet

1166
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:41,010
before he could push
for the impeachment.

1167
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,754
Now, having reduced
the society to squalor,

1168
01:24:44,755 --> 01:24:48,248
the Federal Reserve bankers decided that
the Gold Standard should be removed.

1169
01:24:48,396 --> 01:24:50,335
In order to do this,
they needed to acquire

1170
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,060
the remaining gold in the system.

1171
01:24:52,095 --> 01:24:54,745
So, under the pretense
of helping to end

1172
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:57,945
the Depression came
the 1933 Gold Seizure.

1173
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:01,150
Under threat of imprisonment
for 10 years, everyone in America

1174
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,990
was required to turn in all
gold bullion to the Treasury,

1175
01:25:04,025 --> 01:25:06,740
essentially robbing the public of
what little wealth they had left.

1176
01:25:07,558 --> 01:25:10,663
At the end of 1933,
the gold standard was abolished.

1177
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:13,605
If you look at a dollar bill
from before 1933,

1178
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,912
it says
it is redeemable in gold.

1179
01:25:16,771 --> 01:25:18,317
If you look
at a dollar bill today,

1180
01:25:18,352 --> 01:25:22,328
it says it is legal tender, which means
it is backed by absolutely nothing.

1181
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:24,114
It is worthless paper.

1182
01:25:24,234 --> 01:25:26,065
The only thing that
gives our money value

1183
01:25:26,066 --> 01:25:27,897
is how much of it
is in circulation.

1184
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:31,763
Therefore the power
to regulate the money supply

1185
01:25:31,815 --> 01:25:34,220
is also the power
to regulate its value,

1186
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:39,108
which is also the power to bring entire
economies and societies to its knees.

1187
01:25:47,091 --> 01:25:49,308
It's important
to clearly understand:

1188
01:25:49,343 --> 01:25:51,512
The Federal Reserve
is a private corporation.

1189
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:54,063
It is about as "Federal"
as "Federal Express."

1190
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:56,657
It makes its own policies,
and is under

1191
01:25:56,692 --> 01:25:58,360
virtually no regulation
by the US government.

1192
01:25:58,671 --> 01:26:02,241
It is a private bank
that loans all the currency

1193
01:26:02,276 --> 01:26:03,631
at interest
to the government,

1194
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:06,474
completely consistent
with the fraudulent

1195
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:09,608
central banking model that the
country sought to escape from

1196
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:12,511
when it declared independence in
the American Revolutionary War.

1197
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:16,325
Now, going back to 1913,
the Federal Reserve Act was not

1198
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,554
the only unconstitutional bill
pushed through Congress.

1199
01:26:18,825 --> 01:26:22,283
They also pushed
the federal income tax.

1200
01:26:22,462 --> 01:26:24,103
It's worthwhile
to point out that

1201
01:26:24,154 --> 01:26:27,355
the American public's ignorance
towards the federal income tax

1202
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:30,431
is a testament to how
dumbed-down and oblivious

1203
01:26:30,466 --> 01:26:32,267
the American population
really is.

1204
01:26:32,573 --> 01:26:36,508
First of all, the federal income
tax is completely unconstitutional,

1205
01:26:36,676 --> 01:26:38,940
as it is a direct,
unapportioned tax.

1206
01:26:39,245 --> 01:26:43,204
All direct taxes have to be apportioned
to be legal based on the Constitution.

1207
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:46,118
Secondly, the required
number of states in order to

1208
01:26:46,119 --> 01:26:49,420
ratify the amendment to allow
the income tax was never met,

1209
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:51,616
and this has even been cited in
modern court cases.

1210
01:26:57,566 --> 01:27:00,706
Third, at the present day,
roughly 25%

1211
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:02,999
of the average worker's income
is taken via this tax.

1212
01:27:03,205 --> 01:27:05,227
and guess where that money goes.

1213
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:09,286
It goes to pay the interest on
the currency being produced

1214
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:11,995
by the fraudulent
Federal Reserve Bank,

1215
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:14,693
a system that does not
have to exist, at all.

1216
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:17,604
The money you make working
almost three months

1217
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:19,369
out of the year
goes almost literally

1218
01:27:19,371 --> 01:27:21,869
into the pockets of the
international bankers,

1219
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:24,721
who own the private
Federal Reserve Bank,

1220
01:27:24,893 --> 01:27:27,421
And fourth, even with
the fraudulent government

1221
01:27:27,456 --> 01:27:29,058
claim as to the legality
of the income tax,

1222
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:34,514
there is literally no statute,
no law in existence,

1223
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:36,683
that requires you
to pay this tax.

1224
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:37,632
Period.

1225
01:27:37,707 --> 01:27:41,584
I really expected that
of course there's a law,

1226
01:27:41,619 --> 01:27:46,836
that you can point to in the law book
that requires you to file a tax return.

1227
01:27:46,871 --> 01:27:47,344
Of course there is.

1228
01:27:47,683 --> 01:27:50,638
I was at that point
where I couldn't find

1229
01:27:50,673 --> 01:27:53,255
the statute that clearly
made a person liable,

1230
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:56,709
at least not me,
and most people I know,

1231
01:27:56,744 --> 01:28:00,872
and I had no choice in
my mind except to resign.

1232
01:28:00,907 --> 01:28:03,160
Based on the research
that I did throughout

1233
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:05,211
the year 2000
and that I'm still doing,

1234
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:07,040
I have not found that law.

1235
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:09,530
I've asked Congress,
a lot of people,

1236
01:28:09,565 --> 01:28:11,486
we've asked the
IRS Commissioner's helpers,

1237
01:28:12,027 --> 01:28:14,060
they can't answer,
because if they answer,

1238
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:17,450
the American people are gonna know
that this whole thing is a fraud.

1239
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:22,265
I haven't filed a federal income
tax return since I left.

1240
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,723
I have not filed a
tax return since 1999.

1241
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:29,459
The income tax is nothing less than
the enslavement of the entire country.

1242
01:28:30,295 --> 01:28:34,934
Now, the control of the economy
and the perpetual robbery of wealth

1243
01:28:34,969 --> 01:28:38,303
is only one side of the Rubik's Cube
the bankers hold in their hands.

1244
01:28:38,338 --> 01:28:41,967
The next tool
for profit and control is war.

1245
01:28:43,612 --> 01:28:45,859
Since the inception of the
Federal Reserve in 1913,

1246
01:28:45,894 --> 01:28:48,862
a number of large and
small wars have commenced.

1247
01:28:48,897 --> 01:28:52,813
The 3 most pronounced were
World War I, World War II, and Vietnam.

1248
01:28:53,865 --> 01:28:55,049
World War I.

1249
01:28:55,084 --> 01:28:59,540
In 1914, European wars broke out
centered around England and Germany.

1250
01:28:59,575 --> 01:29:02,212
The American public wanted
nothing to do with the war,

1251
01:29:02,247 --> 01:29:05,163
in turn President Wilson
publicly declared neutrality.

1252
01:29:05,364 --> 01:29:07,430
However, under the surface,

1253
01:29:07,729 --> 01:29:10,668
the US administration was looking for
any excuse they could find to enter it.

1254
01:29:10,837 --> 01:29:14,834
In a noted observation by
Secretary of State William Jennings:

1255
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:18,190
"The large banking interests were
deeply interested in the World War,

1256
01:29:18,225 --> 01:29:19,909
because of the wide opportunities
for large profits."

1257
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:23,978
It's important to understand
that the most lucrative thing

1258
01:29:23,979 --> 01:29:26,763
that can happen for
international bankers, is war.

1259
01:29:26,798 --> 01:29:29,617
For it forces the county
to borrow even more money

1260
01:29:29,652 --> 01:29:31,420
from the Federal Reserve Bank,
at interest.

1261
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:36,980
Woodrow Wilson's top adviser
and mentor was Colonel Edward House,

1262
01:29:37,015 --> 01:29:38,988
a man with
intimate connections with

1263
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:41,353
the international bankers
who wanted in the war.

1264
01:29:41,388 --> 01:29:45,647
In a documented conversation between
Colonel House, Wilson's Advisor,

1265
01:29:45,682 --> 01:29:48,282
and Sir Edward Grey,
The Foreign Secretary of England,

1266
01:29:48,317 --> 01:29:50,521
regarding how to get America
into the war.

1267
01:29:50,556 --> 01:29:52,138
Grey inquired:

1268
01:29:52,173 --> 01:29:54,943
"What will Americans do if Germans
sink an Ocean Liner

1269
01:29:54,978 --> 01:29:56,500
with American passengers
on board?"

1270
01:29:56,535 --> 01:29:57,905
House responded:

1271
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:01,419
"I believe that a flame of indignation
would sweep the United States

1272
01:30:01,454 --> 01:30:04,488
and that by itself would be
sufficient to carry us into war."

1273
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,656
So, on May 7th 1915 on essentially
the suggestion of Sir Edward Grey,

1274
01:30:10,691 --> 01:30:13,316
a ship called the Lusitania
was deliberately sent

1275
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:15,083
into German controlled waters

1276
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:17,458
where German
military vessels were know to be.

1277
01:30:17,493 --> 01:30:21,012
And, as expected,
German U-boats torpedoed the ship,

1278
01:30:21,047 --> 01:30:24,686
exploding stored ammunition,
killing 1200 people.

1279
01:30:26,852 --> 01:30:30,134
To further understand the
deliberate nature of this setup,

1280
01:30:30,169 --> 01:30:33,899
the German Embassy actually put
advertisements in the New York Times,

1281
01:30:33,934 --> 01:30:36,244
telling people that if
they boarded the Lusitania,

1282
01:30:36,279 --> 01:30:37,898
they did so
at their own risk,

1283
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:40,282
as such a ship sailing
from America to England

1284
01:30:40,317 --> 01:30:42,621
through the war zone,
would be liable to destruction.

1285
01:30:42,656 --> 01:30:46,486
In turn and as anticipated,
the sinking of the Lusitania

1286
01:30:46,521 --> 01:30:49,276
caused a wave of anger
among the American population

1287
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:52,383
and America entered the
war a short time after.

1288
01:30:54,098 --> 01:30:58,249
The 1st World War caused
323,000 American deaths.

1289
01:30:59,684 --> 01:31:02,549
J.D. Rockefeller made
200 million dollars off of it.

1290
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:07,080
Not to mention the war cost about
30 billion dollars for America,

1291
01:31:07,425 --> 01:31:11,448
most of which was borrow from the
Federal Reserve Bank at interest,

1292
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:14,116
furthering the profits of
the international bankers.

1293
01:31:14,898 --> 01:31:16,174
World War 2.

1294
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:20,963
On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked
the American fleet at Pearl Harbor,

1295
01:31:20,998 --> 01:31:22,101
triggering our entry
into that war.

1296
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,535
President Franklin D. Roosevelt
declared that

1297
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:28,093
the attack was a
"day that will live in infamy".

1298
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,828
A day of infamy indeed,

1299
01:31:29,863 --> 01:31:32,771
but not because of the alleged
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

1300
01:31:33,002 --> 01:31:36,897
After 60 years of surfacing information,
it is clear that not only

1301
01:31:36,932 --> 01:31:39,599
was the attack on Pearl Harbor
known weeks in advance,

1302
01:31:39,634 --> 01:31:42,309
it was outright wanted
and provoked.

1303
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:46,441
Roosevelt, whose family had been
New York bankers since the 18th century,

1304
01:31:46,476 --> 01:31:49,430
whose uncle Fredrik was on the
original Federal Reserve Board,

1305
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:52,926
was very sympathetic to the
interests of the international bankers

1306
01:31:52,961 --> 01:31:55,226
and the interest
was to enter the war.

1307
01:31:55,261 --> 01:31:57,664
And as we have seen,
nothing is more profitable

1308
01:31:57,699 --> 01:31:59,634
for international bankers,
than war.

1309
01:31:59,669 --> 01:32:02,660
In a journal entry,
by Roosevelt's Secretary of War

1310
01:32:02,695 --> 01:32:06,282
Henry Stimson,
dated November 25th, 1941,

1311
01:32:06,317 --> 01:32:08,806
he documented a conversation
he had with Roosevelt:

1312
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:12,332
"The question was how should we maneuver
them into firing the first shot.

1313
01:32:12,367 --> 01:32:15,786
It was desirable to make sure the
Japanese be the ones to do this

1314
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:19,259
so that there should remain no doubt
as to who were the aggressors."

1315
01:32:19,294 --> 01:32:22,020
In the months leading up to
the attack on Pearl Harbor,

1316
01:32:22,055 --> 01:32:25,723
Roosevelt did everything
in his power to anger the Japanese,

1317
01:32:25,758 --> 01:32:27,429
showing a posture
of aggression.

1318
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:29,505
He halted all of Japans' imports
of American Petroleum.

1319
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:33,015
He froze all the Japanese assets
in the United States.

1320
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:35,458
He made public loans
to Nationalist China

1321
01:32:35,493 --> 01:32:37,426
and supplied military aid
to the British,

1322
01:32:37,461 --> 01:32:39,262
both enemies
to Japan in the war...

1323
01:32:39,297 --> 01:32:43,078
Which, by the way, is completely in
violation of international war rules.

1324
01:32:43,113 --> 01:32:45,629
And, on December 4th,
3 days before the attack,

1325
01:32:45,664 --> 01:32:48,318
Australian Intelligence
told Roosevelt about

1326
01:32:48,353 --> 01:32:51,851
a Japanese task force
moving towards Pearl Harbor.

1327
01:32:51,886 --> 01:32:53,094
Roosevelt ignored it.

1328
01:32:53,129 --> 01:32:57,086
So, as hoped and allowed,
on December 7th 1941,

1329
01:32:57,121 --> 01:33:00,267
Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,
killing 2400 soldiers.

1330
01:33:00,302 --> 01:33:03,794
Before Pearl Harbor,
83% of the American public

1331
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:05,009
wanted nothing
to do with the war.

1332
01:33:05,044 --> 01:33:08,409
After Pearl Harbor, 1 million men
volunteered for the war.

1333
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:13,509
It is important to note,
Nazi Germany's war effort

1334
01:33:13,544 --> 01:33:16,261
was largely supported
by two organizations,

1335
01:33:16,296 --> 01:33:18,112
one of which
was called I.G. Farben.

1336
01:33:18,147 --> 01:33:22,696
I.G. Farben produced 84% of Germany's
explosives and even the Zyklon B

1337
01:33:22,731 --> 01:33:24,793
used in the concentration camps
to kill millions.

1338
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:27,920
One of the unspoken partners
of I.G. Farben was

1339
01:33:27,955 --> 01:33:31,353
J.D. Rockefeller's
Standard Oil Company in America,

1340
01:33:31,388 --> 01:33:33,749
In fact, the German Air Force
could not operate without

1341
01:33:33,784 --> 01:33:36,737
a special additive patterned
by Rockefeller's Standard Oil.

1342
01:33:36,772 --> 01:33:40,343
The drastic bombing of London
by Nazi Germany, for example,

1343
01:33:40,378 --> 01:33:43,543
was made possible by a 20
million dollar sale of fuel

1344
01:33:43,578 --> 01:33:46,638
to I.G. Farben by the
Rockefeller Standard Oil Company.

1345
01:33:46,673 --> 01:33:48,823
This is just one small point
about how

1346
01:33:48,824 --> 01:33:51,656
American business funded
both sides of World War 2.

1347
01:33:51,896 --> 01:33:54,615
One other treasonous organization
worth mentioning

1348
01:33:54,616 --> 01:33:58,101
is the Union Banking Corporation
of New York City.

1349
01:33:58,136 --> 01:34:01,703
Not only did it finance numerous
aspects of Hitler's rise to power,

1350
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:03,950
along with actual
materials during the war,

1351
01:34:03,985 --> 01:34:06,423
it was also a Nazi
money laundering bank,

1352
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:07,926
which was eventually exposed
for having

1353
01:34:07,927 --> 01:34:10,542
millions of dollars
of Nazi Money in its vaults.

1354
01:34:10,577 --> 01:34:13,358
The Union Banking Corporation
of New York was eventually

1355
01:34:13,393 --> 01:34:16,430
seized for violation of the
Trading with the Enemy Act.

1356
01:34:16,465 --> 01:34:19,409
Guess who the director and
vice-president of the Union Bank was?

1357
01:34:20,124 --> 01:34:23,523
Prescott Bush,
our current president's grandfather,

1358
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:25,289
and of course,
our former President's father.

1359
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:28,028
Keep that in mind,
when considering

1360
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:30,785
the moral and political
dispositions of the Bush family.

1361
01:34:34,139 --> 01:34:34,972
Vietnam.

1362
01:34:35,392 --> 01:34:39,959
The United States official declaration
of war on North Vietnam in 1964,

1363
01:34:39,994 --> 01:34:44,036
came after an alleged incident involving
two US destroyers being attacked

1364
01:34:44,071 --> 01:34:47,710
by North Vietnamese
PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.

1365
01:34:47,745 --> 01:34:49,999
This was known as the
Gulf of Tonkin Incident.

1366
01:34:50,034 --> 01:34:53,358
This single situation
was the catalystic pretext

1367
01:34:53,393 --> 01:34:55,625
for massive troop deployment
and full fledged warfare.

1368
01:34:56,296 --> 01:34:58,051
One problem however.

1369
01:34:58,086 --> 01:35:01,873
The attack on the US destroyers
by Vietnamese PT boats...

1370
01:35:01,908 --> 01:35:03,228
never happened.

1371
01:35:03,263 --> 01:35:07,635
It was a completely staged event
to have an excuse to enter the war.

1372
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:11,247
Former Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara, stated years later

1373
01:35:11,282 --> 01:35:14,055
that the Gulf of Tonkin incident
was a "mistake",

1374
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:16,946
while many other insiders
and officers have come forward

1375
01:35:16,981 --> 01:35:20,420
relaying that it was a contrived farce,
a complete lie.

1376
01:35:20,623 --> 01:35:23,574
Once in the war,
it was business as usual.

1377
01:35:23,609 --> 01:35:26,299
In October 1966,
President Lyndon Johnson

1378
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:28,717
lifted trading restrictions
on the Soviet Block,

1379
01:35:28,752 --> 01:35:31,030
knowing full well that the Soviets
were providing

1380
01:35:31,031 --> 01:35:34,074
upwards of 80% of
North Vietnam's war supplies.

1381
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:38,606
Consequently, Rockefeller interests
financed factories in the Soviet Union,

1382
01:35:38,641 --> 01:35:40,893
which the Soviets
used to manufacture

1383
01:35:40,928 --> 01:35:43,041
military equipment and
send to North Vietnam.

1384
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:45,414
However, the funding
of both sides of

1385
01:35:45,415 --> 01:35:48,091
this conflict was only
one side of the coin.

1386
01:35:48,126 --> 01:35:51,913
In 1985, Vietnam's Rules of Engagement
were declassified.

1387
01:35:52,155 --> 01:35:55,921
This detailed what American troops were
and were not allow to do in the war.

1388
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,357
It included absurdities like:

1389
01:35:58,392 --> 01:36:02,016
North Vietnamese anti-aircraft
missile systems could not be bombed

1390
01:36:02,051 --> 01:36:04,234
until they were known
to be fully operational.

1391
01:36:04,402 --> 01:36:08,394
No enemy could be pursued once they
crossed the border of Laos or Cambodia.

1392
01:36:08,605 --> 01:36:11,751
And most revealing of all,
the most critical,

1393
01:36:11,786 --> 01:36:14,275
strategic targets were
not allowed to be attacked,

1394
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,412
unless initiated by
high military officials.

1395
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,584
Apart from
these imposed limitations,

1396
01:36:19,619 --> 01:36:23,017
North Vietnam was informed
of these restrictions

1397
01:36:23,052 --> 01:36:25,395
and therefore could create
entire strategies

1398
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:27,467
around the limitations
of the American Forces.

1399
01:36:27,502 --> 01:36:31,153
This is why the war went on so long
and the bottom line is this:

1400
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:34,356
The Vietnam War
was never meant to be won...

1401
01:36:34,391 --> 01:36:36,194
Just sustained.

1402
01:36:36,401 --> 01:36:40,305
This war for profit resulted in
58,000 American deaths

1403
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:46,852
and 3 million
dead Vietnamese.

1404
01:36:46,887 --> 01:36:49,275
So, where are we now.

1405
01:36:49,648 --> 01:36:52,599
September 11th was the jumpstart
for what is now

1406
01:36:52,634 --> 01:36:54,813
an accelerating agenda
by the ruthless elite.

1407
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:57,170
It was
a staged war pretext,

1408
01:36:57,171 --> 01:36:59,321
no different than the
sinking of the Lusitania,

1409
01:36:59,492 --> 01:37:02,590
the provoking of Pearl Harbor
and the Gulf of Tonkin lie.

1410
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:06,061
In fact if 9/11 wasn't
a planned war pretext,

1411
01:37:06,096 --> 01:37:07,800
it would be an exception
to the rule.

1412
01:37:07,967 --> 01:37:11,839
It has been used to launch
two unprovoked illegal wars.

1413
01:37:11,874 --> 01:37:14,305
One against Iraq and
one against Afghanistan.

1414
01:37:14,608 --> 01:37:17,371
However, 9/11 was the pretext
for another war as well.

1415
01:37:18,019 --> 01:37:18,874
The war against you.

1416
01:37:19,045 --> 01:37:21,398
The Patriot Act,
Homeland Security,

1417
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,463
the Military Tribunals Act
and other legislations,

1418
01:37:24,498 --> 01:37:28,582
are all completely and entirely designed
to destroy your civil liberties

1419
01:37:28,617 --> 01:37:31,620
and limit your ability to fight back
against what is coming.

1420
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,976
Currently
in the United States,

1421
01:37:33,977 --> 01:37:36,348
unannounced to most
brainwashed Americans,

1422
01:37:36,383 --> 01:37:38,732
your home can be searched
without a warrant,

1423
01:37:38,767 --> 01:37:40,228
without you being home,

1424
01:37:40,263 --> 01:37:43,486
you can, in turn, be arrested
with no charges revealed to you,

1425
01:37:43,521 --> 01:37:47,768
detain indefinitely with no access
to a lawyer and legally tortured.

1426
01:37:48,009 --> 01:37:51,945
All under the suspicion
that you might be a "terrorist".

1427
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:55,148
If you need a painted picture of
what is happening in the country,

1428
01:37:55,349 --> 01:37:57,716
let's recognize
how history repeats itself.

1429
01:37:58,586 --> 01:38:03,517
In February 1933,
Hitler staged a false flag attack,

1430
01:38:04,183 --> 01:38:07,023
burning down his own
German parliament building,

1431
01:38:07,024 --> 01:38:10,289
the Reichstag,
and blamed it on communist terrorists.

1432
01:38:10,499 --> 01:38:13,059
Within the next few weeks,
he passed the Enabling Act,

1433
01:38:13,302 --> 01:38:16,436
which completely eradicated
the German Constitution

1434
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:18,039
destroying people's liberties.

1435
01:38:18,074 --> 01:38:20,141
He then let
a series of preemptive wars

1436
01:38:20,376 --> 01:38:22,700
all justified
to the German people as

1437
01:38:22,779 --> 01:38:25,781
necessary to maintaining
"homeland security".

1438
01:38:58,814 --> 01:39:01,213
Our enemy is a
radical network of terrorists

1439
01:39:01,596 --> 01:39:04,809
and every government
that supports them.

1440
01:39:07,325 --> 01:39:08,724
It's time to wake up.

1441
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:11,661
The people in power
go out of their way

1442
01:39:11,896 --> 01:39:16,281
to make sure you are perpetually
mislead and manipulated.

1443
01:39:16,316 --> 01:39:18,817
The majorities perception
of reality,

1444
01:39:18,818 --> 01:39:21,668
especially in the political arena
is not their own.

1445
01:39:21,907 --> 01:39:25,900
It is shrewdly imposed upon them,
without them even knowing it.

1446
01:39:26,411 --> 01:39:29,752
For example, the public
at large actually believes

1447
01:39:29,787 --> 01:39:31,371
the invasion of Iraq
is going badly,

1448
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:34,551
as sectarian violence
doesn't seem to stop.

1449
01:39:34,753 --> 01:39:36,415
What the public fails to see,

1450
01:39:36,589 --> 01:39:40,006
is that the destabilization
of Iraq is exactly

1451
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:42,026
what the people
behind the government want.

1452
01:39:42,327 --> 01:39:45,956
This war is to be sustained,
so the region can be divided up,

1453
01:39:46,164 --> 01:39:48,496
domination
of the oil maintained,

1454
01:39:48,497 --> 01:39:51,290
continual profits reaped
for the defense contractors

1455
01:39:51,325 --> 01:39:54,505
and most importantly,
permanent military bases established

1456
01:39:54,774 --> 01:39:58,253
to be used as a launching pad
against other oil bearing,

1457
01:39:58,288 --> 01:40:00,974
non-conforming countries,
such as Iran and Syria,

1458
01:40:01,609 --> 01:40:03,114
For further implication,

1459
01:40:03,155 --> 01:40:06,447
that the civil war and destabilization
is purely intentional--

1460
01:40:06,482 --> 01:40:11,725
In 2005, 2 elite British SAS officers
were arrested by Iraq police

1461
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,636
after being caught driving around
in their car shooting at civilians,

1462
01:40:15,671 --> 01:40:17,829
while dressed up as Arabs.

1463
01:40:17,997 --> 01:40:20,990
After being arrested and
taken to a jail in Basra,

1464
01:40:21,235 --> 01:40:23,897
the British army immediately
requested the release of these men.

1465
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:28,283
When the Basra government refused,
British tanks came in

1466
01:40:28,318 --> 01:40:32,040
and physically broke out the
men from the Basra prison.

1467
01:40:32,546 --> 01:40:36,745
If you wish to destroy an area,
how do you do it?

1468
01:40:36,918 --> 01:40:37,969
Well there are two ways:

1469
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:40,718
You can go in there and bomb it, and so
forth, but that is not very efficient.

1470
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:44,315
What you do is try to get the people
in that area to kill each other

1471
01:40:44,559 --> 01:40:48,360
and to destroy there own territory,
their own farms.

1472
01:40:48,564 --> 01:40:50,327
And that's what
has been done in that area.

1473
01:40:50,565 --> 01:40:56,003
The way in which you destroy an
opponent is get him to destroy himself,

1474
01:40:56,271 --> 01:40:58,398
by dividing his ranks
against one another.

1475
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,092
Then you feed both sides,

1476
01:41:00,123 --> 01:41:02,997
you have agents feeding both sides,
inflaming both sides.

1477
01:41:03,514 --> 01:41:04,677
And they kill each other off.

1478
01:41:06,082 --> 01:41:09,882
And it's time that some of us
woke up to this reality.

1479
01:41:10,086 --> 01:41:15,855
To understand that people who try to
maintain empires and create empires,

1480
01:41:15,993 --> 01:41:20,828
do it by manipulating the people
they are trying to conquer.

1481
01:41:21,231 --> 01:41:24,200
You might to ask yourself
why the entire culture

1482
01:41:24,235 --> 01:41:28,572
is utterly saturated with
mass media entertainment from all sides,

1483
01:41:28,771 --> 01:41:33,641
while the educational system in America
continues it stupefying downward slide

1484
01:41:33,810 --> 01:41:36,193
since the US government
decided to take over

1485
01:41:36,228 --> 01:41:38,251
and subsidize
the public school system.

1486
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:43,682
What your government pays for,
it gets.

1487
01:41:44,155 --> 01:41:47,486
When we understand that,
then we look at

1488
01:41:47,486 --> 01:41:51,391
government financed institutions
of education

1489
01:41:51,629 --> 01:41:55,082
and see the kind of students
and the kind of education that is

1490
01:41:55,083 --> 01:41:58,536
being turned out by these
government financed schools,

1491
01:41:58,737 --> 01:42:03,730
logic will tell you that if what is
being turned out in those schools

1492
01:42:03,908 --> 01:42:08,277
was not in accord with what the state
and the federal government wanted,

1493
01:42:08,446 --> 01:42:11,313
then it would change it.

1494
01:42:11,449 --> 01:42:15,716
The bottom line is that the government
is getting what they have ordered.

1495
01:42:15,854 --> 01:42:21,527
They do not want
your children to be educated.

1496
01:42:21,562 --> 01:42:25,395
They do not want you
to think too much.

1497
01:42:25,631 --> 01:42:28,828
That is why our country
and our world has become

1498
01:42:28,863 --> 01:42:31,596
so proliferated
with entertainments,

1499
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:37,971
mass media, television shows,
amusement parks, drugs, alcohol

1500
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,007
and every kind
of entertainment,

1501
01:42:40,212 --> 01:42:43,512
to keep the human mind
entertained.

1502
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:46,455
So that you don't get
in the way of

1503
01:42:46,476 --> 01:42:50,653
important people by
doing too much thinking.

1504
01:42:50,957 --> 01:42:53,255
You had better wake up
and understand

1505
01:42:53,426 --> 01:42:57,158
that there are people who are guiding
your life and you don't even know it."

1506
01:42:57,498 --> 01:43:00,228
We are
in a lot of trouble!

1507
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:05,443
Because you people and
62 million other Americans

1508
01:43:05,478 --> 01:43:07,071
are listening to me right now.

1509
01:43:07,106 --> 01:43:10,808
Because less than 3 percent
of you people read books.

1510
01:43:11,213 --> 01:43:15,979
Because less 15 percent
of you read newspapers.

1511
01:43:16,117 --> 01:43:19,575
Because the only truth you know
is what you get over this tube.

1512
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:23,475
Right now there is a whole,
an entire generation

1513
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:24,959
that never knew anything

1514
01:43:24,994 --> 01:43:26,223
that didn't come out
of this tube.

1515
01:43:27,929 --> 01:43:32,025
This tube is the gospel,
the ultimate revelation.

1516
01:43:32,267 --> 01:43:37,136
This tube can make or break
presidents, popes, prime ministers...

1517
01:43:37,305 --> 01:43:41,001
This tube is the most
awesome goddamn force

1518
01:43:41,036 --> 01:43:43,472
in the whole godless world
and woe is us,

1519
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:45,613
if it ever falls in the
hands of the wrong people.

1520
01:43:45,748 --> 01:43:48,925
And when the largest company
in the world controls

1521
01:43:49,018 --> 01:43:54,087
the most awesome goddamn propaganda
force in the whole godless world,

1522
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:58,488
who knows what shit will be
peddled for truth on this network!

1523
01:43:58,694 --> 01:44:01,369
So you listen to me...
Listen to me:

1524
01:44:01,404 --> 01:44:04,332
Television
is not the truth.

1525
01:44:04,367 --> 01:44:06,739
Television is a
goddamned amusement park,

1526
01:44:06,937 --> 01:44:09,536
television is a circus,
a carnival,

1527
01:44:09,537 --> 01:44:12,285
a traveling troop of acrobats,
story tellers,

1528
01:44:12,342 --> 01:44:13,890
dancers,
singers, jugglers,

1529
01:44:13,919 --> 01:44:17,336
sideshow freaks,
lion tamers and football players.

1530
01:44:17,548 --> 01:44:20,108
We are in the
boredom killing business!

1531
01:44:20,317 --> 01:44:24,410
But you people sit there,
day after day, night after night,

1532
01:44:24,445 --> 01:44:26,586
all ages, colors, creeds...

1533
01:44:26,824 --> 01:44:28,689
We are all you know.

1534
01:44:28,859 --> 01:44:31,555
You're beginning to believe
the illusions we are spinning here,

1535
01:44:31,762 --> 01:44:33,776
you are beginning to think
the tube is reality

1536
01:44:33,777 --> 01:44:35,522
and that your own lives
are unreal.

1537
01:44:35,867 --> 01:44:37,979
You do
whatever the tube tells you.

1538
01:44:38,103 --> 01:44:40,116
You dress like the tube,
you eat like the tube,

1539
01:44:40,166 --> 01:44:43,239
you raise your children like the tube,
you even think like the tube...

1540
01:44:43,275 --> 01:44:46,508
This is mass madness,
you maniacs.

1541
01:44:46,978 --> 01:44:49,539
In God's name,
you people are the real thing.

1542
01:44:49,748 --> 01:44:52,273
We are the illusion!

1543
01:44:55,054 --> 01:44:57,579
The last thing the men
behind the curtain want

1544
01:44:57,823 --> 01:45:01,588
is a conscious informed public,
capable of critical thinking.

1545
01:45:01,993 --> 01:45:06,158
Which is why a continually fraudulent
zeitgeist is output via religion,

1546
01:45:06,398 --> 01:45:09,231
the mass media,
and the educational system.

1547
01:45:09,635 --> 01:45:12,832
They seek to keep you in
a distracted, naive bubble.

1548
01:45:13,672 --> 01:45:16,266
And they are doing a
damn good job of it.

1549
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:21,374
In 2005, an arrangement between Canada,
Mexico and the United States was made.

1550
01:45:21,781 --> 01:45:23,853
This arrangement,
unannounced to the public,

1551
01:45:23,888 --> 01:45:25,395
unregulated by Congress,

1552
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:28,542
merges the United States,
Canada and Mexico

1553
01:45:28,543 --> 01:45:31,654
into one entity,
erasing all borders.

1554
01:45:32,393 --> 01:45:34,227
It's called
the North American Union.

1555
01:45:34,262 --> 01:45:36,752
You might want to ask yourself
why you have never heard of this.

1556
01:45:37,364 --> 01:45:40,595
In fact, there is only one mainstream
reporter who has actually heard of,

1557
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:42,632
and has had the courage
to cover this issue.

1558
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:46,336
The Bush Administration's
Open Borders Policy

1559
01:45:46,371 --> 01:45:47,643
and its decision to ignore

1560
01:45:47,683 --> 01:45:50,370
the enforcement of this country's
immigration laws

1561
01:45:50,578 --> 01:45:52,808
is part
of a broader agenda.

1562
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:55,093
President Bush
signed a formal agreement

1563
01:45:55,094 --> 01:45:57,073
that will end the United States,
as we know it.

1564
01:45:57,585 --> 01:46:01,454
And he took the step without approval
from either the US Congress,

1565
01:46:01,657 --> 01:46:03,476
or the people
of the United States.

1566
01:46:04,093 --> 01:46:06,227
It's a deal that few
have even heard of.

1567
01:46:06,395 --> 01:46:09,922
It's been done again,
by very few people, at the very top,

1568
01:46:10,098 --> 01:46:12,062
on behalf
of the investment class.

1569
01:46:12,113 --> 01:46:13,863
But the working class
of people,

1570
01:46:14,502 --> 01:46:18,906
political officials across our country
from communities and cities,

1571
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:20,838
they don't know anything
about this.

1572
01:46:21,276 --> 01:46:22,971
This isn't some trade agreement.

1573
01:46:23,178 --> 01:46:25,942
It is a total removal of
sovereignty from these countries

1574
01:46:26,181 --> 01:46:29,618
which will also result in a completely
new currency called the Amero.

1575
01:46:29,919 --> 01:46:33,199
Apart from that, I think the one thing
that people who are

1576
01:46:33,234 --> 01:46:35,311
dollar based need to focus on
is the Amero,

1577
01:46:35,426 --> 01:46:37,435
that's the one thing that
nobody is talking about.

1578
01:46:37,476 --> 01:46:39,437
I think it's going
to have a big impact on

1579
01:46:39,477 --> 01:46:44,199
everybody's life in
Canada, the US and Mexico.

1580
01:46:44,335 --> 01:46:47,963
The Amero is the proposed new currency
for the North American Community,

1581
01:46:48,104 --> 01:46:51,904
which is being developed right now
between Canada the US and Mexico

1582
01:46:52,075 --> 01:46:55,169
to make a borderless community,
much like the EU,

1583
01:46:55,345 --> 01:46:58,684
and the Dollar, the Canadian Dollar
and the Mexican Peso

1584
01:46:58,719 --> 01:46:59,838
will be replaced
by the Amero.

1585
01:47:00,217 --> 01:47:02,692
By default of this agreement,
the American Constitution

1586
01:47:02,727 --> 01:47:04,551
will eventually be obsolete.

1587
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:06,710
You would think that
a situation like this

1588
01:47:06,741 --> 01:47:09,558
would be on the cover
of every major newspaper.

1589
01:47:09,793 --> 01:47:12,592
That is until you realize that
the people behind this movement

1590
01:47:12,897 --> 01:47:15,530
are the same people who are
behind the main stream media

1591
01:47:15,565 --> 01:47:18,163
and you are not told what
you are not supposed to know.

1592
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:21,405
The North American Union is the
same concept as the European Union,

1593
01:47:21,573 --> 01:47:24,132
the African Union and
the soon-to-be Asian Union

1594
01:47:24,341 --> 01:47:26,435
and the same people
are behind all of them.

1595
01:47:26,645 --> 01:47:28,876
And when the time is right,
the North American Union,

1596
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:32,147
the European Union, the African Union
and the Asian Union

1597
01:47:32,187 --> 01:47:35,508
will be merged together,
forming the final stages of a plan

1598
01:47:35,547 --> 01:47:39,289
these men have been working on
for over 60 years.

1599
01:47:39,457 --> 01:47:42,018
A one world government.

1600
01:48:40,288 --> 01:48:44,349
One bank, one army,
one center of power.

1601
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:47,222
And if we have learned
anything from history.

1602
01:48:47,262 --> 01:48:53,399
It is that power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1603
01:48:53,602 --> 01:48:56,537
This is Aaron Russo,
a filmmaker and former politician.

1604
01:48:57,139 --> 01:48:59,628
To his left is
Nicholas Rockefeller

1605
01:48:59,678 --> 01:49:03,135
of the infamous Rockefeller
Banking and Business Dynasty.

1606
01:49:03,378 --> 01:49:05,882
After maintaining a close
friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller,

1607
01:49:05,912 --> 01:49:08,020
Aaron eventually
ended the relationship,

1608
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:12,244
appalled by what he had learn about
the Rockefellers and their ambitions.

1609
01:49:12,788 --> 01:49:17,184
I got a call one day from an attorney
I knew and she said:

1610
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:18,701
"Would you like to meet
one of the Rockefellers?"

1611
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:21,022
And I said:
"Sure I would love to."

1612
01:49:21,231 --> 01:49:27,067
And we became friends and he began
to divulge a lot of things to me,

1613
01:49:27,403 --> 01:49:29,098
so he said to me,
one night, he said:

1614
01:49:29,272 --> 01:49:30,619
"There's going to be
an event, Aaron,

1615
01:49:31,323 --> 01:49:34,939
and out of that event,
we are going to go into Afghanistan,

1616
01:49:35,246 --> 01:49:37,976
so we can run pipelines
from the Caspian Sea,

1617
01:49:38,149 --> 01:49:40,197
we are going to go into Iraq
to take the oil

1618
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:41,855
and establish a base
in the Middle East

1619
01:49:41,894 --> 01:49:46,252
and we are gong to go into
Venezuela and get rid of Chavez."

1620
01:49:46,656 --> 01:49:49,990
The first 2 they have accomplished,
Chavez they didn't accomplish.

1621
01:49:50,261 --> 01:49:53,992
And he said: "You are going to see
guys going into caves looking for...

1622
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:58,333
looking for people they
are never going to find."

1623
01:49:58,536 --> 01:50:01,739
He was laughing about the fact
that you have this war on Terror,

1624
01:50:01,774 --> 01:50:03,605
and there is no real enemy.

1625
01:50:03,842 --> 01:50:07,844
He was talking about how by having
this war on terror you can never win it,

1626
01:50:07,879 --> 01:50:09,608
because it is
an eternal war,

1627
01:50:09,658 --> 01:50:12,646
and so you can always keep
taking peoples liberties away.

1628
01:50:12,818 --> 01:50:16,551
And I said: "How are you going to
convince people that this war is real?"

1629
01:50:16,755 --> 01:50:20,776
And he said: "By the media, the media
can convince everybody that it's real."

1630
01:50:20,811 --> 01:50:24,796
You just keep talking about things and
saying them over and over and over again

1631
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:26,730
and eventually,
people believe it.

1632
01:50:26,932 --> 01:50:29,760
You know, they create the Federal
Reserve in 1913 through lies.

1633
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,356
They create 9/11,

1634
01:50:31,406 --> 01:50:33,342
which was another lie.

1635
01:50:33,392 --> 01:50:37,857
Through 9/11, then you are fighting a war on
terror and all the sudden you go into Iraq,

1636
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:39,111
which was another lie,

1637
01:50:39,162 --> 01:50:40,950
and now,
they are going to do Iran.

1638
01:50:41,562 --> 01:50:43,221
It's all one thing
leading to another,

1639
01:50:43,222 --> 01:50:44,881
leading to another,
leading to another...

1640
01:50:44,985 --> 01:50:47,451
I would say to him:
"What are you doing this for?

1641
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:48,326
What's the point of this thing?

1642
01:50:48,366 --> 01:50:50,195
You have all the money in the world
you would ever want,

1643
01:50:50,196 --> 01:50:51,435
you have all the power,

1644
01:50:51,475 --> 01:50:54,255
you're hurting people.
It's not a good thing."

1645
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:57,597
And he would say:
"What do you care about the people for?

1646
01:50:57,632 --> 01:50:59,219
Take care of yourself and
take care of your family".

1647
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:03,122
And then I said:
"So what are the ultimate goals here?"

1648
01:51:03,904 --> 01:51:06,226
He said:
"The ultimate goal is to get

1649
01:51:06,275 --> 01:51:08,956
everyone in this world
chipped with an RFID chip.

1650
01:51:09,289 --> 01:51:13,401
And have all money be on those chips
and have everything on those chips,

1651
01:51:13,401 --> 01:51:16,673
and if anyone wants to protest
what we do or violate what we want,

1652
01:51:16,724 --> 01:51:18,509
we can just
turn off their chip."

1653
01:51:19,543 --> 01:51:21,006
That's right--
micro chipped.

1654
01:51:21,066 --> 01:51:24,227
In 2005, Congress,
under the pretense of immigration

1655
01:51:24,228 --> 01:51:27,389
control and the
so-called war on terrorism,

1656
01:51:27,562 --> 01:51:31,685
passed the Real ID act,
under which it is projected by May 2008,

1657
01:51:31,715 --> 01:51:35,367
you will be required to carry
around a Federal Identification card

1658
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:37,616
which includes on it
a scannable barcode

1659
01:51:37,651 --> 01:51:38,880
with your personal information.

1660
01:51:39,474 --> 01:51:42,375
However this barcode is
only an intermediary step,

1661
01:51:42,577 --> 01:51:47,069
before the card is equipped with
a VeriChip RFID Tracking Module,

1662
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:51,080
which will use radio frequencies to
track your every move on the planet,

1663
01:51:52,024 --> 01:51:53,980
If this sounds foreign to you,
please note

1664
01:51:54,256 --> 01:51:58,921
that the RFID tracking chip is already
in all new American passports.

1665
01:52:00,163 --> 01:52:02,354
And the final step
is the implanted chip,

1666
01:52:02,404 --> 01:52:05,116
which many people have
already been manipulated

1667
01:52:05,117 --> 01:52:06,940
into accepting
under different pretenses.

1668
01:52:07,503 --> 01:52:11,987
We have a Florida family who are
really pioneers in a brave new world.

1669
01:52:12,676 --> 01:52:14,676
They have volunteered
to be the first ever,

1670
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:17,976
to have microchip
identification devices

1671
01:52:18,015 --> 01:52:19,921
implanted into their bodies.

1672
01:52:20,483 --> 01:52:24,351
After 9/11, I was really concerned
with the security of my family.

1673
01:52:27,224 --> 01:52:29,791
I wouldn't mind having something
planted permanently in my arm,

1674
01:52:29,831 --> 01:52:31,991
that would identify me.

1675
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:36,356
In the end, everybody will be
locked into a monitored control grid,

1676
01:52:36,396 --> 01:52:39,138
where every single action
you perform is documented,

1677
01:52:39,178 --> 01:52:42,378
and if you get out of line,
they can just turn off your chip,

1678
01:52:42,429 --> 01:52:45,090
for at that point in time,
every single aspect of society

1679
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:47,830
will revolve around
interactions with the chips.

1680
01:52:48,612 --> 01:52:50,580
This is the picture
that is painted for the future

1681
01:52:50,581 --> 01:52:51,936
if you open your eyes
to see it.

1682
01:52:52,483 --> 01:52:55,106
A centralized one world economy,
where everyone's moves

1683
01:52:55,146 --> 01:52:58,086
and everyone transactions
are tracked and monitored.

1684
01:52:58,123 --> 01:52:59,577
All rights removed.

1685
01:53:03,395 --> 01:53:05,156
The incredible aspect of all:

1686
01:53:06,331 --> 01:53:09,699
These totalitarian elements
will not be forced upon the people,

1687
01:53:09,936 --> 01:53:12,302
the people will demand them.

1688
01:53:12,505 --> 01:53:15,838
For the social manipulation of society,
through the generation of fear

1689
01:53:16,209 --> 01:53:18,264
and division has completely
detached humans

1690
01:53:18,295 --> 01:53:20,231
from their sense
of power and reality.

1691
01:53:21,348 --> 01:53:23,748
A process, which has been going on
for centuries if not millennia...

1692
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:24,939
Religion.

1693
01:53:25,151 --> 01:53:26,516
Patriotism.

1694
01:53:26,586 --> 01:53:27,265
Race.

1695
01:53:27,314 --> 01:53:28,289
Wealth.

1696
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:29,232
Class.

1697
01:53:29,272 --> 01:53:30,906
And every other form
of arbitrary,

1698
01:53:30,937 --> 01:53:33,686
separatist identification
and thus conceit,

1699
01:53:33,736 --> 01:53:36,329
has served to create a
controlled population,

1700
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:38,695
utterly malleable
in the hands of the few.

1701
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:41,787
Divide and Conquer
is the motto,

1702
01:53:41,828 --> 01:53:44,225
and as long as people continue
to see themselves

1703
01:53:44,243 --> 01:53:46,002
as separate from everything else,

1704
01:53:46,051 --> 01:53:48,768
they lend themselves to
being completely enslaved.

1705
01:53:49,977 --> 01:53:53,045
The men behind the curtain know this.
And they also know,

1706
01:53:53,214 --> 01:53:56,846
that if people ever realize the
truth of their relationship to nature,

1707
01:53:56,846 --> 01:53:59,742
and the truth
of their personal power...

1708
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,329
The entire manufactured
Zeitgeist they prey upon,

1709
01:54:02,371 --> 01:54:04,787
will collapse
like a house of cards.

1710
01:54:15,904 --> 01:54:23,024
The whole system that we live in,
drills into us that we are powerless,

1711
01:54:23,059 --> 01:54:26,878
that we are weak, that society is evil,
that it's crime ridden and so forth.

1712
01:54:26,882 --> 01:54:29,787
It is all a big fat lie!

1713
01:54:29,822 --> 01:54:32,507
We are powerful,
beautiful, extraordinary.

1714
01:54:33,761 --> 01:54:37,362
There is no reason
why we cannot understand

1715
01:54:37,397 --> 01:54:40,212
who we truly are;
where we are going.

1716
01:54:40,247 --> 01:54:44,549
There is no reason why the average
individual cannot be fully empowered.

1717
01:54:44,584 --> 01:54:47,137
We are
incredibly powerful beings.

1718
01:54:48,944 --> 01:54:51,069
I think
I spent 30 years of my life,

1719
01:54:51,682 --> 01:54:54,158
the first 30,
trying to become something.

1720
01:54:54,193 --> 01:54:56,248
I wanted to become
good at things,

1721
01:54:56,288 --> 01:54:58,774
I wanted to become good
at tennis and school and grades.

1722
01:54:58,915 --> 01:55:01,008
And everything I kinda
viewed in that perspective,

1723
01:55:01,218 --> 01:55:04,313
I'm not okay the way I am,
but if I got good at things...

1724
01:55:05,022 --> 01:55:07,319
I realized that
I had the game wrong.

1725
01:55:07,591 --> 01:55:10,788
Because the game was to
find out what I already was.

1726
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:38,150
Now, in our culture we have been trained
for individual differences to stand out.

1727
01:55:38,185 --> 01:55:40,516
So you look at each person
and the immediate hit is.

1728
01:55:40,692 --> 01:55:44,061
Brighter, dumber, older,
younger, richer, poorer...

1729
01:55:44,096 --> 01:55:46,960
And we make all these
dimensional distinctions,

1730
01:55:46,995 --> 01:55:48,957
put them in categories
and treat them that way.

1731
01:55:48,992 --> 01:55:53,092
And get so we only see others
as separate from ourselves

1732
01:55:53,127 --> 01:55:54,808
in the ways
in which they are separate.

1733
01:55:55,173 --> 01:55:59,685
And one of the dramatic
characteristics of experience

1734
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,608
is being with another person
and suddenly seeing

1735
01:56:01,781 --> 01:56:05,292
the ways in which they are like you,
not different from you.

1736
01:56:05,327 --> 01:56:08,835
And experiencing the fact
that which is essence in you,

1737
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:11,163
which is essence in me,
is indeed, One.

1738
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:15,190
The understanding that there
is no other. It is all One.

1739
01:56:19,232 --> 01:56:22,360
I wasn't born Richard Albert,
I was just born as a human being

1740
01:56:22,602 --> 01:56:26,582
and then I learned
this whole business of who I am,

1741
01:56:26,617 --> 01:56:30,165
and whether I'm good or bad,
or achieving or not...

1742
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:31,721
All that's learned
along the way.

1743
01:56:47,662 --> 01:56:52,725
The old appeals to racial,
sexual and religious shovanism,

1744
01:56:52,968 --> 01:56:55,697
to rabid nationalistic fervor,

1745
01:56:56,003 --> 01:56:57,938
are beginning
not to work.

1746
01:56:58,173 --> 01:57:03,829
A new consciousness is developing which
sees the earth as a single organism,

1747
01:57:03,864 --> 01:57:09,491
and recognizes, that an organism
at war with itself is doomed.

1748
01:57:41,184 --> 01:57:44,483
Bill Hicks
used to finish his shows

1749
01:57:44,755 --> 01:57:46,814
with this:

1750
01:57:48,492 --> 01:57:51,620
Life's like a ride
in an amusement park,

1751
01:57:51,795 --> 01:57:54,192
and when you go on it,
you think it's real

1752
01:57:54,227 --> 01:57:55,935
because that's how powerful
our minds are.

1753
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:59,338
The ride goes up and down
and round and round,

1754
01:57:59,373 --> 01:58:01,794
it has thrills and chills
and it's very brightly colored.

1755
01:58:01,829 --> 01:58:05,197
And it's very loud and
it's fun for a while.

1756
01:58:05,475 --> 01:58:08,951
Some have been on the ride for a
long time and they begin to question:

1757
01:58:08,986 --> 01:58:11,211
Is this real?
Or is this just a ride?

1758
01:58:11,783 --> 01:58:15,464
And other people have remembered and
they come back to us and they say:

1759
01:58:15,499 --> 01:58:17,652
'Hey, don't worry,
don't be afraid ever.

1760
01:58:18,089 --> 01:58:19,909
Cause this is just a ride.'

1761
01:58:21,225 --> 01:58:23,312
And we kill those people.

1762
01:58:23,829 --> 01:58:27,306
Shut him up, I have got a lot
invested in this ride, shut him up!

1763
01:58:28,165 --> 01:58:29,700
Look at my frowns of worry...

1764
01:58:29,735 --> 01:58:32,159
Look at my big bank account
and my family...

1765
01:58:32,194 --> 01:58:33,162
This has to be real...

1766
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:35,768
It's just a ride.

1767
01:58:36,075 --> 01:58:38,681
But we always kill those good guys
who try and tell us that,

1768
01:58:38,716 --> 01:58:39,204
you ever notice that?

1769
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:41,508
And we let the demons
run a muck...

1770
01:58:42,047 --> 01:58:44,777
But it doesn't matter,
because it is just a ride

1771
01:58:44,983 --> 01:58:47,211
and we can change it
anytime we want.

1772
01:58:47,486 --> 01:58:49,019
It is only a choice.

1773
01:58:49,054 --> 01:58:52,187
No effort, no work, no job,
no savings of money.

1774
01:58:52,392 --> 01:58:54,476
Just a choice right now.

1775
01:58:54,928 --> 01:58:56,543
Between fear,

1776
01:58:57,964 --> 01:58:59,274
and love.
