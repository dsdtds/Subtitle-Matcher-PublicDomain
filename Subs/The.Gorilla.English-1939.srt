2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,280
Good night, good night.

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

4
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,600
That I shall say good night
til it be 'morrow.

5
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,400
Good night, good night.

6
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

7
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,320
That I shall say good night
til it be 'morrow.

8
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
Good night...

9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
Good night!

10
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,720
Help! Help!

11
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,600
Murder! Police!

12
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,720
Help!

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
Mr. Stevens!

14
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,040
Peters, help!

15
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,000
Help! Help!

16
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,400
Help!

17
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Help!

18
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,800
Help! It's after me!

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,760
Help! Help!

20
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
Please, help!

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
Help! It's after me!

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,600
Help!

23
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Peters!

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Stevens!

25
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
Mr. Stevens!

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Help!

27
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,760
Help!

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,480
Please!

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,520
Help!

30
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,200
Help!

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,280
Well, Kitty,
what is all this racket about?

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Peters! Oh, Peters!
I saw 'em! I saw 'em!

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,260
He's here in this house! He almost 
killed me! The Gorilla! The Gorilla!

34
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,150
- It was awful! He'd've gotten ahold of...
- Be quiet!

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
- You have been dreaming.
- Oh, no!

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,280
- What's that?
- I don't know. I tell you, I don't know anything!

37
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,360
Call the police! Call Mr. Stevens!
He'll kill somebody!

38
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
- Be quiet, can't you!
- No, I can't!

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,520
I can't stay here or
we'll all be murdered!

40
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,200
Mr. Stevens! Mr. Stevens!

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
- Were you calling me, Kitty?
- Oh, Mr. Stevens!

42
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,600
We'll all be murdered in our beds!

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,760
It's that gorilla fellow
the papers are so full of!

44
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,080
The killer!
He was just up in my room!

45
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Why, now, come, Kitty,
you're hysterical.

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,760
Oh, no, sir, I ain't hysterical!
I've seen him like I said, sir!

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,120
Oh, Kitty, you're imagining things.
Just you go back to bed.

48
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,880
That's what I said, sir,
only there is this.

49
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,160
The Gorilla's paw.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,560
Shall I call the police, sir?

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,840
The police? Yes, yes,
call them right away.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
Just a minute.

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,560
I'll handle this my own way.

54
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,480
- Yes, sir. Only...
- Only what?

55
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,440
You're thinking of the time, sir.

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,200
The time?

57
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,600
According to the newspapers, the Gorilla 
gives his victim only 24 hours notice.

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
Oh, nonsense!

59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
Now you go back to bed
and don't worry about this.

60
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,220
- Back to bed?
- Who, me?

61
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,599
Or don't go back to bed. I'm not
particularly interested in where you go.

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,990
- Oh, but, Mr. Stevens!
- Kitty...

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,320
- Yes, but...
- I...

64
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Hello?

65
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,040
Oh, now, come please...

66
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,360
Just a minute.

67
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,840
That'll be all.

68
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,480
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah, but...

69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,680
I wouldn't be frightened like that
if I were you, Kitty.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
Look, you be frightened any way you want.
This is my way.

71
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Hello?

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,440
I begged you not to telephone me here.

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Yes, I know I promised, but...

74
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
You gave me until Monday.

75
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160
Saturday?

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
Tomorrow?

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,360
That's impossible!

78
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,200
I can't possibly raise that amount
of money.

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes, I know I owe it to you, but..

80
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,200
A quarter of a million dollars?

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,360
Look, please, now...

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,920
Oh, please be patient.

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,000
I have a plan.

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
But it's only just started.

85
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,600
Give me time to work it out
and I'll repay you dollar for dollar.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hello?

87
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,480
I want to send a radiogram, please.

88
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,560
To whom is the radiogram going, please?

89
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
Ms. Norma Denby.

90
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
'D' as in 'Denver'.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,040
Aboard the S.S. Paris.

92
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,760
'Regret unable to meet you at boat.'

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,920
'Mightily important that I see you at
my home, tomorrow evening, without fail.'

94
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,120
Sign it, 'Fondly, Uncle Walter.'

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
Read that back please.

96
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,680
I'm Norma Denby.

97
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,640
Mr. Stevens is expecting you, Ms. Denby.

98
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
- May I take your coat?
- No, thank you. I'll keep it on.

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,960
Nice cozy little place your uncle has here.

100
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,280
He likes it.

101
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
He'd have to live in it.

102
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,400
This way, please.

103
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,480
Well, well, well!
If it isn't the prodigal niece!

104
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Oh, it's swell seeing you again, darling.

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,400
And good to see you again, too, dear.

106
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,400
I took the liberty of bringing
along my accomplice.

107
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,800
- Good, I'm glad you did.
- This is Jack, Uncle Walter.

108
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,940
This niece of mine
isn't much of a corrispondent

109
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
but the few letters she did write,
they were full of you.

110
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,280
Congratulations, young man.

111
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you, and I hope you'll excuse me
for barging in like this.

112
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,120
Nonsense, I'm delighted.

113
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,480
I was more than pleasantly surprised to
hear that you set your marriage for June.

114
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,640
Do you realize it's only a month away?

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,960
Well, we decided we didn't wanna
rush things too much, so...

116
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,000
- So we put it off until...
- The day after tomorrow.

117
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
The day after tomorrow?

118
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,280
Does it startle you?

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,040
Why... Why, no, no, that's fine.

120
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,560
That's one of the things I wanted
to talk to you about.

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,800
But I'm forgetting my role as host.

122
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Sit down, my dear, sit down.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,400
We may as well come to the point...

124
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,560
Perhaps you'd rather talk to Norma alone
Mr. Stevens.

125
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,115
Oh, no, no.

126
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,680
No, not at all. As Norma's future husband,
what I have to say concerns you, too.

127
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,760
Now, as Norma knows, she and I were named joint
heirs under the terms of her father's will.

128
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,720
And until she marries,
I'm the executer of her estate.

129
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
But should anything happen to either of us...

130
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,960
Why then, the survivor is the head of the
entire estate.

131
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
And I think that you, Norma, and you, Jack,
as her future husband...

132
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,480
...should know of what that estate consists.

133
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,000
To that end, I have prepared a record
of your estate's holdings.

134
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,800
And I want to talk it over with you both
after dinner.

135
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
But your radiogram said there was
something urgent.

136
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,720
Well, if it hadn't been urgent,
I wouldn't have sent it.

137
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,800
Well, something's worrying you.
What is it, Uncle Walter?

138
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Well, perhaps I'm unduly alarmed, but...

139
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,160
Last night, I received this note of warning.

140
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,520
From the Gorilla.

141
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,800
The Gorilla?

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,160
You mean that murderer, the ones the papers
have been so full of?

143
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,560
I do.

144
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,940
Well, isn't it possible 
that this is all just a joke,

145
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:51,240
that someone's playing a prank on you?

146
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,640
I wish I could think so.

147
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,080
But, Uncle Walter,
why should he or anyone want to kill you?

148
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
I don't know.

149
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,680
Oh, it's possible some old enemy of mine...
I bet I made enemies in my day...

150
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,920
It's possible that one of them in a spurt
of revenge has hired this maniac...

151
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,000
...this professional killer,
or whatever the Gorilla is.

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
But this note is exactly like the one
that was in the newspapers.

153
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,720
After he murdered that widow.

154
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,520
Still, I can't bring myself to believe it.

155
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,240
Of course, you've notified the police?

156
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,520
No, I haven't.

157
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,920
- But surely, if there was anything in all this.
- I'm taking other precautions.

158
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,840
Peters and I are armed,

159
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,440
and in addition, I've engaged the
services of a private detective agency.

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
Their operative should be here any moment now.

161
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,320
Well, obviously,
this Gorilla is no ordinary murderer at all.

162
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,440
And judging by his past,
shall we say, successes...

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,840
It is apparent the workings of the police
were a load of bullock to him.

164
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,440
Of course there's a slim chance that, by not
notifying the police, we might upset his plans.

165
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,080
Ordinarily, I'm not easily frightened, but...

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
I must admit this whole affair's
giving me the creeps.

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,240
Well, it's nearly nine o'clock. Now suppose you
freshen up a bit. We'll talk it over after dinner.

168
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,640
Oh, Kitty, show Ms. Denby to the green room,
and Mr. Marsden to my room.

169
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,160
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, Uncle Walter.

170
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,560
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Stevens.

171
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,400
- Yes, Kitty?
- Oh, I know it's customary to give notice...

172
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,680
Why, Kitty, you're not trying to tell me
you're going to leave me?

173
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Oh, no, sir.
I'm trying to tell you I have left you.

174
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,800
But, Kitty, you're perfectly safe here!

175
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Besides, we have guests.
You haven't the heart to leave me now!

176
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,100
Well, my heart is willing,

177
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:33,400
but I'm gonna have an awful time trying
to convince the rest of my body.

178
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,680
I'll bet there's a dead body in every room.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,520
Dead body won't hurt you.

180
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,960
Can't do you any good.

181
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,840
Well? What are we waiting for?

182
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,840
Let's go.

183
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,960
- Who did it?
- You!

184
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,320
- Who's with it tonight, chief?
- Make a note, then.

185
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,800
Keep doing it every once in a while.
It keeps me on edge and thinking.

186
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:28,560
Right.

187
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
Now what do you suppose
they want detectives for?

188
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,640
I've got an idea.
Let's go in and find out.

189
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,000
You're terrific.

190
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,360
By George, it's Peters!

191
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,920
- Who are you?
- Me? Why I'm Peters sir.

192
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:55,800
Nevermind that, nevermind that.
What's your name?

193
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,480
- Peters, sir.
- Just a minute, just a minute.

194
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,320
Where were you last night?

195
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,400
- I beg your pardon!
- Oh, so you did do something.

196
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,900
I don't like your looks.

197
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,500
What's that got to do with it?
This is no beauty contest.

198
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,840
- Who's Stevens?
- I am.

199
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
- I'm Harrigan.
- I'm Mulligan.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm Garrity.

201
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,720
Harrigan? Mulligan? Garrity?

202
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,320
I sent for you because I need protection.

203
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,280
- My life's been threatened.
- Now, tell me. Any clues?

204
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
One very vital one.

205
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,920
This warning from the Gorilla.

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
That's weird.
You got nothing to worry about.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,880
Mark that down, Garrity.

208
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:47,680
Right. How do you spell Gorilla?
Two R's or two L's?

209
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,520
Gorilla? Gorilla...

210
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
G- O-R... G! G?

211
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,520
G- O... Oh!

212
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,320
Gori...?

213
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,160
Did you... did you...?

214
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
Did you say Gorilla?

215
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,240
Why, gentlemen, you're not afraid?

216
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,040
- Oh, no, no, no. We're not afraid.
- We just thought maybe we...

217
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,280
- Thank you.
- The Gorilla coming here?

218
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,960
- It was nice to have met you, Mr. Stevens.
- Quiet!

219
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,920
Quiet!

220
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,840
Ah, yes.

221
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,880
I've already taken the precaution
of arming my servant and myself.

222
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,600
And I think you'll find every door
and window securely bolted.

223
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,440
I couldn't've done better myself.

224
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,120
With that sort of job, Mr. Stevens, 
you've got nothing to worry about.

225
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,920
What's your plan, Mr. Harrigan?

226
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,920
Well, first we'll take a look 
around the house. Come on, men.

227
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,880
Now, you just sit tight, Mr. Stevens.

228
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,040
The Gorilla will get you over our 
dead bodies.

229
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,040
- Jack?
- Yes, darling?

230
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
- Who were those men?
- Probably the detectives your uncle hired.

231
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,720
Jack, I'm terribly worried.
What are we going to do?

232
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,200
Well, it seems there isn't anything
we can do yet.

233
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,360
Listen, darling. It isn't that I'm trying to
appear skeptical. It's just that, well...

234
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,320
Somehow I can't make myself believe all this.

235
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
But that note! You saw the note.

236
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,720
Of course I did. But, still, I...

237
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,360
Look, darling. We'll wait.

238
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,440
We'll wait and see if something
really does happen.

239
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
But what if it does?

240
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
I just don't believe it will.

241
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
Jack!

242
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,540
Excuse me, sir.

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,840
I try to put your car away. But unfortunately 
there's something wrong with it.

244
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,480
What do you mean?

245
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,640
It won't start.

246
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
Excuse me, sir.

247
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,480
He gives me the creeps.

248
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,680
He doesn't exactly give me an
appetite either.

249
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
But I wouldn't let him worry you
if I were you.

250
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,120
Honestly darling, don't you think
there's any cause for alarm?

251
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,360
I'm afraid I don't.

252
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,480
Oh, there you are.
Have a sherry before dinner?

253
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,640
Thank you, no.

254
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,840
Uncle Walter,
how long have you had that butler?

255
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,000
Not very long. Why?

256
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,880
Well, are you sure he's alright?

257
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,760
I've found him so. Why?

258
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,800
Well, because I...

259
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,480
Dinner is served, sir.

260
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
Oh. Shall we go in?

261
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,400
You'd better drink a little of that,
Kitty.

262
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
It'll quiet your nerves.

263
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,760
Why? Can you hear them?

264
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Oh, here, take it.

265
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,640
What my nerves really need is a good,
long trip!

266
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,840
Here!

267
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
Now, look here,
where were you last night?

268
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,200
- Me? Why, I...
- Answer yes or no!

269
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,080
- I was...
- What were you doing there?

270
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,880
- Doing where?
- Well, how do we know?

271
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,520
Besides, I don't like your looks.

272
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,840
Did you ever take a good look
at yourself?

273
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,360
- Yeah!
- Yeah, did you ever take a look...?

274
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,840
Here, now wait a minute you.
Where were you last night?

275
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,200
I spent the night with Shakespeare.

276
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,720
Yeah? Where is he?

277
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,840
He's dead.

278
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,600
Dead!

279
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,040
A murder mystery!

280
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Have any idea who did it?

281
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,360
Look, Shakespeare's been dead
hundreds of years!

282
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,880
Hundreds of...? This is a fine time to
call us in on the case.

283
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,920
Say, but she couldn't've done it.

284
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
- How do you know?
- She can't be hundreds of years old.

285
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,240
That's write. Mark that down, Garrity.

286
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah, what do we do now, chief?

287
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,040
Well, you two have a look out there.
I'll look here.

288
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

289
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,440
What's this?

290
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,880
That's a door.

291
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,360
It leads to the back stairs.

292
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Back stairs?

293
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,840
Well, remind me to have a look
up there sometime.

294
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,520
That's an ironing board.

295
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Yes.

296
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,200
It's an ironing board.

297
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,880
Look, do you want this thing?

298
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,880
Certainly we want it.
Why do you think we iron on it?

299
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Well, I...

300
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,320
Well, here, take it!

301
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,800
Garrity! Garrity! Garrity!

302
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,720
Come in here! We found it!

303
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,120
- You found what?
- The mystery.

304
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,080
- Well, that's hash.
- Ain't that a mystery?

305
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,400
- Some very good turkey, chief.
- I'll be the judge of that.

306
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm afraid gentlemen,
you won't find the Gorilla in there.

307
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Why will we not find the Gorilla in there?

308
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,880
Now, listen you! I've had...!

309
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,200
Let that be a lesson to you.

310
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,920
Perhaps you gentlemen had better look
outside for clues.

311
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,520
Maybe he killed Shakespeare.
Mark that down, Garrity.

312
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,880
Yeah.

313
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,680
Look, how do you get out of here?

314
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,080
That's what I'd like to know.

315
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,720
- Where's the back door?
- In back of you.

316
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,000
In back of me?

317
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,899
Don't you recall that the paper said
the Gorilla always sends a warning

318
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,480
to as many as half a dozen people
at the same time?

319
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,920
To sorta throw the police off.

320
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
Maybe that's what he's doing now.

321
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,560
Perhaps it's just a ruse.

322
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,920
Well, let's hope so.

323
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,120
You know, it's wonderful how much
more optimistic

324
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,420
a good dinner can make one feel.

325
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,880
Shall we have licueurs in the study?

326
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
- Walter!
- Peters, Peters, a light, quickly!

327
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,600
Jack!

328
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,240
What is it? What happened?

329
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,920
Oh, uncle, are you hurt?

330
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,720
Why, no. No.

331
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,200
I don't know what happened.

332
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,520
Look here.

333
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,820
It seems to have been thrown in,
through that window.

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Oh, Uncle Walter!

335
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,560
What are we going to do?

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,760
The first thing you're going to do, or
rather Jack is going to do...

337
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,600
Is to take you away from here.

338
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,960
But you're coming with us.

339
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,000
It's him! It's him!

340
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,160
Uncle Walter!

341
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,320
Who is it?

342
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,960
Oh! It's alright.
It's one of those detectives.

343
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,120
He did give me a turn!

344
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,040
Did you see that face?

345
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
I bet when he gets drunk,
snakes see him.

346
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
What's the matter with you,
scaring us half to death?

347
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm just trying to let you know,
I'm not the Gorilla!

348
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,360
This is my niece, Ms. Denby,
and her fiance, Mr. Marsden.

349
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,080
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.

350
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,560
This seems to be a bit more serious
than I thought.

351
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,760
I just received this from the Gorilla.

352
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
A note. Who brought it?

353
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,440
No one brought it.
It was thrown in through that window.

354
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,640
Through that window? Ha,
through that window!

355
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,480
- He's right!
- Wait a minute.

356
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,560
This is my good ear.

357
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,880
Oh, say, that's right!
You can't kid us!

358
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,280
We were outside patrolling the grounds!

359
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,880
What do you mean?

360
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,520
Why, the note couldn't have come through
that window.

361
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,720
- Why not?
- Well, I'll just show you. Stand back, ma'am.

362
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,080
- That's why.
- But it was wrapped around a stone.

363
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
It was... a stone?

364
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
Well, why didn't you say so?

365
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,000
Anyway, what do you know about this thing?

366
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
Well, I don't know anything about it.
We were preparing to leave the room...

367
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,720
...and suddenly the lights went out and...

368
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,160
...then there was a crash and...

369
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,720
So the lights went out, eh?

370
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,520
- Make a note of that, Garrity.
- Fine.

371
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,200
You were outside a few minutes ago.
Didn't you see anybody?

372
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,240
Nobody but us. Say,
this note says at midnight.

373
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,840
- At midnight?
- Yeah.

374
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,080
What time's it now?

375
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,960
- It's 10:30.
- I got 11:10.

376
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,480
I got 11:30.

377
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,680
It is exactly 11:45.

378
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
Remind me to put some hands on this watch.

379
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,120
- Yes. Well, make a note of that, Garrity.
- Right.

380
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,720
Now, look. The Gorilla's after Stevens.

381
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,920
We'll have to keep an eye on 'em.
Everybody, into the study.

382
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,080
Come on, let's go.

383
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,160
Who said that if you give a criminal
enough rope, he'll hang himself?

384
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
- You, chief!
- Oh, that's where I heard it before.

385
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,160
Come on.

386
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,580
Now that you're all here, I don't want
anybody to move, understand?

387
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,900
Is it alright if I breathe?

388
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,260
Yes, but come right back.

389
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,380
Quiet!

390
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,980
Personally, I don't believe the Gorilla's
coming here.

391
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,340
Neither do I.

392
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,900
Why not?

393
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,620
I'll give you three good reasons, pal.

394
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,140
Harrigan, Mulligan and Garrity.

395
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,620
It ain't enough.

396
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,020
Now, look here!

397
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,540
- I don't wanna have no
... Now, wait a minute. I'll handle this.

398
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,500
- Yeah, but you always...
- Yeah, but you...

399
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,900
You have received the Gorilla's warning,
Walter Stevens.

400
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,900
You've just five minutes to live.

401
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,780
Oh, Uncle Walter! Jack...

402
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,420
- Excuse me.
- Here, here, here. Now where you going?

403
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,460
- I'm getting out of here.
- There's no door there!

404
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,760
Well, that's alright. I'll make one.

405
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,620
Quiet, quiet everybody!

406
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,300
Did you hear that?

407
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,700
I wish I didn't.

408
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,820
He's up there, men!

409
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,980
- Where you going?
- I say, he's up there!

410
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,260
That's what I thought you said.

411
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,900
Quiet.

412
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,060
Alright, men. Follow me!

413
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,820
Stick 'em up! I got you covered!

414
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,540
- What happened? What was it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

415
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,700
Hey! Did you just pass here?

416
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,580
Yes. Yes, of course. I brought the 
trunk down from the attic.

417
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,740
- A trunk?
- Yes.

418
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,500
Were we here?

419
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,700
I couldn't say.

420
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,220
Well, maybe we're not here now.

421
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,260
Maybe.

422
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
May...

423
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,620
It's two minutes of twelve.
What about Uncle Walter?

424
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,900
Uncle Walter, yes...
Uncle Walter, we've...

425
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,780
Just going in here... We'll...

426
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,580
Now, everybody!

427
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,380
Stay just where you are.

428
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,900
Mulligan, you watch those doors.
Garrity, you watch that one.

429
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,140
Mr. Stevens, you've...
got nothing to worry about.

430
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,580
I wish I thought so.

431
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,820
Me, too.

432
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,940
You have one more minute,
Walter Stevens.

433
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,260
I can't stand it any longer! I can't!

434
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,100
You've got to call the police!
You've got to!

435
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,820
Mr. Stevens, I'm sorry,
but Norma's right.

436
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,020
I don't know what this is all about,

437
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,620
but certainly if there's something to it,
the police oughta know about it.

438
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,460
I no longer know what to think.

439
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,100
Perhaps you'd better.

440
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,020
Hello? Hello?

441
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,340
The phone,
there's something wrong with it!

442
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,100
Mulligan, Garrity, it's me!

443
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,780
Uncle Walter! He's gone!

444
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
Gone? How can he be gone when every door
and window in this room has been locked?

445
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,740
Mulligan, check those windows! Garrity,
check that door!

446
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,700
How did you get in here?

447
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,820
Why, through this door, sir.

448
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,420
How can you when the doors are locked?

449
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,260
- I beg your pardon, it was not locked.
- I locked it myself.

450
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,500
- It is locked.
- That leaves us deadlocked.

451
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,900
It would be impossible for me to walk
through the woodwork.

452
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,740
Why? Termites do.

453
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,340
Oh, this isn't getting us anywhere!

454
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,100
Now, leave everything to me!

455
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,300
Gorilla ain't gonna make a monkey out of me.

456
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,460
Now, you...

457
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,180
Come on, boys.

458
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,380
- Where do these stairs lead to?
- To the bedroom.

459
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,220
Mulligan, Garrity, you have a look upstairs.

460
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,420
Marsden, you come with me and we'll
have a look around the grounds.

461
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,700
You two to the servants' wing.

462
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,780
With the Gorilla prowling around? Not me!

463
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,060
Well, alright, then, come with me!

464
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,780
Oh, nevermind. I'll take my chances
with the other Gorilla.

465
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,100
But, wait a minute. We can't leave
Ms. Denby here alone.

466
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,680
Well, what are you waiting for?

467
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
I don't know, but I wish I could think
of something.

468
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,820
- Me, too.
- Oh, go on!

469
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,620
- Don't worry, darling.
- Oh, that's alright. I'll do all the worrying.

470
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,340
Marsden, come with me.

471
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,740
Oh, you first, sir.

472
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,460
Thank you very much.

473
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,580
Why couldn't this've all happened tomorrow?

474
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,860
What difference would that make?

475
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,460
Tomorrow's my day off.

476
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,740
Poor Uncle Walter.
Right from under our very eyes!

477
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,540
I don't understand how he got
out of here.

478
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,700
All that's worrying me is how
I'm gonna get outta here.

479
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,060
Oh, it's him, it's him!

480
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,140
I seen 'em! I seen 'em!
It's the Gorilla! I seen 'em!

481
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,780
What's up?

482
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,180
I seen 'em, it's the Gorilla! I tell you!
He's in the closet there!

483
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,260
Oh, Jack, I'm so frightened!

484
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,180
- Come outta there, you.
- Get 'em, Mulligan.

485
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,460
- You heard him, Garrity.
- What did he say?

486
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,700
Are you sure it wasn't a hallucination?

487
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,180
Not unless a hallucination has hair on it.

488
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,380
Come on.

489
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
- Now, ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

490
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,260
Is he dead?

491
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,220
- Who's he?
- I've never seen him before.

492
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,699
Do you know him?

493
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,980
No, sir. And this is no time for
no introductions.

494
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,940
He's not dead.

495
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,300
- Mark that down, too.
- Right.

496
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,700
Come on, darling. We're getting out
of here. I'm afraid now, too. For you!

497
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,500
And I'm afraid now, too, for me!

498
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,620
Oh, Jack, it's horrible.

499
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,260
I don't know what to make of it.

500
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,580
All I can say is the Gorilla's
around here somewhere!

501
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,020
And I know Mr. Stevens is
around here somewhere!

502
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,940
And if you all look, we'll
find 'em somewhere!

503
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,740
- Where you going?
- Somewhere!

504
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,060
Alright, men. Take 'em upstairs.

505
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,380
- Come on, Garrity.
- You! Lead the way.

506
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,320
I'll take care of 'em. Kitty,
get a basin of hot water.

507
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,940
Do you mind if I go out of town
to get it?

508
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,020
You and I have a look around the house.

509
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,420
Wait a minute. There's something
funny about this.

510
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,940
Kitty said she saw the Gorilla's arm.

511
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,900
We open the closet and find the sailor's body.
Now, how did the body get in there?

512
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,060
And how'd the Gorilla get out
without our seeing him?

513
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,100
That's just what I was about to ask you.

514
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,500
Stevens was sitting right here in this
chair until the lights went out.

515
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,620
Gorilla? Night-night!

516
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,780
That's funny.

517
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,060
What's funny?

518
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,460
Nothing. I think I'll have a look
around this house.

519
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,700
Have a look around the house?

520
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,700
Yes... and have a look around the house.

521
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,900
Yes. I'll go, too.

522
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,300
Hey, that guy won't talk.

523
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,420
- Why not?
- He's still unconscious.

524
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,340
You're unconscious and you talk.

525
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,300
- Hey, that's great, chief.
- Mark that down, Garrity.

526
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,820
- Right.
- What do we do now?

527
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,740
Well, first we'll have to reenact
the crime.

528
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,700
So how do we do that?

529
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,420
Now, let's see. When the lights went out,
Stevens was sitting in that chair.

530
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,820
You're Stevens. Sit down.

531
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,660
- I'm Stevens.
- Mulligan, close the doors.

532
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,860
Hey! I'm Garrity!

533
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,540
You're Stevens! Now sit down!

534
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,260
I'll work the lights.

535
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,300
One, two, three.

536
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,060
Ah, it's no use.

537
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,020
I don't know.
It works for Sherlock Holmes.

538
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,300
I don't know why it won't work for me!

539
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,660
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

540
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,500
- He's gone.
- He's gone?

541
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,100
Gone... Garrity!

542
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,340
Garrity!

543
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,140
Now we have two mysteries to solve.

544
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:11,980
- Look, I've got an idea.
- What is it?

545
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,020
If we can find out how Garrity disappeared,
we'll find out what happened to Stevens.

546
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
That's a very good idea.

547
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Shoulda thought of that myself.

548
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,340
Alright, we'll reenact the crime.
Sit down.

549
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,020
- But I'm not tired.
- Do you have to be tired to sit down?

550
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,460
I do.

551
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,820
You make me tired!

552
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,260
Well, then, why don't you sit down?

553
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,260
If I sit down,
who's gonna work the lights?

554
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,660
- I never thought of that.
- Yeah, well, sit down.

555
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,900
- Yeah, sit down.
- Sit down...

556
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,140
One... two... three!

557
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,700
Mulligan!

558
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,620
Mulligan!

559
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,100
Did you lose something?

560
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,580
Yes, Mulligan and Garrity!

561
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,900
Go over there.

562
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,180
Now, look. Sit down.

563
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,940
Oh, I don't wanna sit down.

564
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
You don't have to want to!
You'll sit down and like it!

565
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,060
Oh, alright.
I'll sit down but I won't like it.

566
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
What're you gonna do?

567
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,780
What I'm gonna do ain't important.

568
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,740
Well, what am I gonna do?

569
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,700
That's just what I wanna find out.

570
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,260
One...

571
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,260
Two...

572
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,060
Two and a... two.

573
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,820
Two...

574
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,100
Two...

575
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,460
Three!

576
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,580
Did I hear somebody scream?

577
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,340
Well, if you didn't, you ought to
have your ears cleaned out!

578
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,300
Say, where's Mr. Harrigan?

579
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,700
The detective! He's disappeared!

580
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,780
Disappeared? What a pity.

581
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,820
Pity? Why, it's entirely...

582
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,780
How did you get in here?

583
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,220
We... Why, you're...

584
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,500
Don't be frightened.
You're safe with me.

585
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,020
Safe with you, I?

586
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,340
Who wants to be safe?

587
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,620
Now, look. I'm very sociable.
I wanna go where there's people!

588
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,420
Hey, what's the matter?
What's happened?

589
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,400
Uh look,

590
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm standing here,
and all of a sudden...

591
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,020
Everything goes black.

592
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,080
The next thing I know, I'm here.

593
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,500
That's funny.

594
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,620
Hello?

595
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,660
Hello, I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

596
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,840
No, no. You turn on Willow Drive.

597
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,340
Off Highway 22, and hurry, will you?

598
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,980
Thank you.

599
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,360
Look, it ain't human, I tell you.

600
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:47,520
It ain't human!

601
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,500
What isn't human?

602
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,180
For a guy to be standing here one minute...

603
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,620
...and the next minute, he's gone!

604
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,220
- Who's gone?
- I'm gone, they're gone, everybody's gone!

605
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,860
It don't make sense.

606
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,660
Certainly doesn't.
Will you have a cigarette?

607
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,140
I don't mind if I do.

608
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,100
He takes us right from
under his very eyes.

609
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,380
Who does?

610
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,580
The Gorilla!

611
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,780
Hey! Who are you?

612
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,860
What do you want?

613
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,340
What are you doing here?

614
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,819
Listen, man. You got me all wrong.
I just came in to use the telephone.

615
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,099
You see, my car broke down and...

616
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,620
This phone?

617
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,940
Look, that phone is out of order.

618
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,380
- Is it?
- Yes.

619
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,700
Number, please?

620
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,780
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be on my way.

621
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,180
Now, wait a minute, you!

622
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,660
You're the guy we're looking for!

623
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,820
- You're the Gorilla!
- Surely you don't think I'm the Gorilla!

624
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
I stopped thinking two hours ago.

625
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,380
- But you don't understand!
- I don't have to understand!

626
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,220
- Shall I try?
- No, you've tried enough, not get 'em up!

627
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,580
Listen, you're making a big mistake.

628
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,180
Well, it won't be the first time.

629
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,940
No... alright...

630
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Alright, I got you covered.

631
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,700
Help!

632
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,420
Shake 'em up... shake 'em up.

633
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,780
Help!

634
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,140
Help!

635
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,780
Oh, help.

636
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,340
Help!

637
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,980
Help!

638
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,380
Help!

639
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,180
Help!

640
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,980
Help me!

641
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,900
What's the matter? What is it?

642
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,580
I got 'em, I got 'em. I tell you,
I got 'em!

643
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,940
- Got 'em, where?
- Yes, he... Well, I did have 'em.

644
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,700
Here, get me out of these.

645
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,940
Keys are in my pocket.

646
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,260
They're right there.

647
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,460
Oh, it was terrible. The Gorilla,
the Gorilla!

648
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,100
How'd you get all tied up like this?

649
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,980
The Gorilla, I tell you.
It wasn't my fault.

650
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,540
He came in and hit me.

651
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,860
It was... Did I leave him in there?

652
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,340
I'm Stevens...

653
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,940
Wait a minute!
How'd you fellows get in there?

654
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,140
You tell me. What're you doing
with those things on?

655
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,460
Oh, look. A fellow walks right in.
It was the Gorilla, I tell you!

656
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,020
- Yeah?
- And starts to use that phone!

657
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,380
But he didn't get very far,
not with me on the job.

658
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,420
Lucky thing for him you had your
handcuffs with you.

659
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,700
Where is he? Where'd he go?

660
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,540
See, I'm the victim. How should I know?

661
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,580
Look, boys, I'm telling you, he walked in,
six of 'em. Six big gorillas, they attacked me.

662
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,820
Hit me right on my crown. Look at that lump.

663
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,300
Yeah, look at this lump.

664
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,260
Right there.

665
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,980
These windows are locked.

666
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,220
From the inside.

667
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,460
You're not kidding.

668
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,120
Kidding? With the Gorilla right under
my nose

669
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:50,079
and a ten thousand dollar reward,
he says I'm kidding!

670
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,540
Well, are you?

671
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,180
Who belongs to this?

672
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,940
What is it?

673
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,100
- A coat.
- Why, gorillas don't wear coats.

674
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
Sure, they do. Fur coats.

675
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,560
There's something screwy about all this.

676
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,640
Look, if there's anything screwy about this...

677
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,240
...it's me.

678
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,360
It's me!

679
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,800
But I'll soon find out.
Each of you grab a wall.

680
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,040
What do we do with it?

681
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,000
Mulligan, you take that one.

682
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,680
Marsden, you take that one.

683
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,240
- I'll take that one.
- I'll sit this one out.

684
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,240
You won't sit anyone out! Grab it!
Grab a wall.

685
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,520
Now, take it easy.

686
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,480
Alright, now tap, each one of you.

687
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,920
See if you can find some trap doors.

688
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,360
Oh, must be out there. Come on, men,
right out here.

689
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,200
Alright, cover the door, men.

690
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,900
What's the matter with all of you,
you deaf?

691
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:53,800
I've been pounding on that door
for the last ten minutes!

692
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,360
- Who are you?
- That's right. Who are you?

693
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Nevermind who I am.
I wanna know where Walter Stevens is.

694
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,800
Oh, you want to know where
Mr. Stevens is, eh?

695
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,800
He wants to know where Walter Stevens is!

696
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,520
Who do you think we're looking for?

697
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,480
I didn't come here to play games.

698
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,040
I wanna see Walter Stevens
and I wanna see 'em right now!

699
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,890
You don't understand.
These gentlemen are detectives.

700
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Detectives, bah!
What are you trying to pull on me?

701
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,120
I talked to Stevens on the telephone
last night.

702
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,960
He told me he had a plan to pay his debt.

703
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,520
- Plan?
- Yes, said he'd only just started working on it.

704
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,040
Well, did he tell you what this plan is?

705
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,680
I wasn't interested.

706
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,320
He wants to square up with me here tonight!

707
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,920
When I talked to him,

708
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:31,520
he wanted a couple of days more
to raise the money that he owes me!

709
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,240
Now where is he?

710
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,160
Well, Mr. Stevens' been kidnapped
by the Gorilla!

711
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,640
Kidnapped by... Poppycock!

712
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,320
Now, look here!
I don't know who any of you are!

713
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,720
But I do know this. Walter Stevens owes
me two hundred and fifty thousand dollars!

714
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,680
And I'm going to collect it!
Tonight! Or else!

715
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,560
- Now, wait a minute.
- Don't, buddy.

716
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,000
How do we know you're...
Say, who are you, anyway?

717
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,800
I'm one of Stevens' clients.

718
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,760
I have proof that Stevens has been stealing
from his clients' accounts for over a year.

719
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,960
I gave him until tonight to return my money.

720
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,800
And I'm not going to leave this house
until I get it.

721
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,520
Yeah, but wait a minute, wait a minute...

722
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,640
I think he's mad.

723
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,200
Jack! If what that man says is true...

724
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,860
I don't believe Uncle Walter could...

725
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,360
It's almost impossible to know
what to believe, darling.

726
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,520
Yet things are adding up.
If your uncle did have a plan,

727
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
if this business of sending for you
was part of the plan...

728
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,720
Take her upstairs and keep an eye on her.
This has gone far enough!

729
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,240
- It's gone too far!
- It's even gone farther than that.

730
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,480
I'll be alright.
It's just too much excitement for one night.

731
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,920
Get your hat and coat, darling.

732
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,520
I'm gonna see that you get to town if I have
to push the car all the way myself.

733
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,800
I can't go til we find Uncle Walter.

734
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,960
We'll take care of that.
We'll break this case, won't we, boys?

735
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,400
- Won't we?
- Oh, sure we will! Sure!

736
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,480
Like it was walnuts.

737
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,800
- You know, I feel sorry for that poor girl.
- Yeah? What about poor us?

738
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,760
Strange men zooming in an out. Animals
running around like this was a zoo!

739
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,880
Crazy goes on! I wanna go home.

740
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,920
Oh, so you wanna go home?
I'm ashamed of you.

741
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,400
I'm ashamed of you!

742
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,400
You wanna take a run off and leave
that girl here to take the blame alone?

743
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,300
- We're detectives, aren't we?
- Are we?

744
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,680
Haven't we looked all over this house?

745
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
- Yes.
- No.

746
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,040
Where haven't we looked?

747
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,640
Well, if there's a cellar,
we haven't looked there.

748
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,680
- I'm glad I thought of that.
- Say, this looks like a cellar.

749
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,720
Where?

750
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,800
- It's locked.
- Well, turn the key.

751
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,160
Oh, yes, never thought of that.

752
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,120
Alright, come on, men.

753
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,560
- Anybody down there?
- Uh, yes. We are.

754
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
- Now, look for a switch.
- It's around here somewhere.

755
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,680
Alright, come on out of there, you.

756
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,040
Come on. Get out of there.

757
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,840
Alright, come on...

758
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,840
Alright, come on out of there!

759
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,320
Mulligan?

760
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,280
- Where are you?
- I'm right here, chief.

761
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,360
Garrity, where are you?

762
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,560
Over here, chief.

763
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,160
Is anybody with me?

764
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
No, you're alone.

765
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,990
Ow! Mulligan, Harrigan. Something bit me!

766
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,240
What? First time I saw a mousetrap
catch a piece of cheese.

767
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,360
Harrigan! Garrity! Please get me outta this!

768
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,200
Get me outta this thing!

769
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,320
- Maybe you'd like a ride.
- Oh, come on, Garrity...

770
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,560
Garrity! Harrigan!

771
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,520
Garrity! Harrigan!

772
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,160
Now, don't worry. I'll handle this.

773
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,440
- It's a pleasure.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

774
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,200
Okay, buddy. Come on, bud.
Get that raccoon coat off.

775
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,320
Come on! Get that thing off!

776
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,400
Want me to hit you over the head
with this thing?

777
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,880
Well...

778
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,600
We've been double-crossed!

779
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,280
Let's get out of here!

780
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,340
- Peters?
- Yes, sir?

781
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,040
What's all that commotion?

782
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Sounds like our friends, the detectives.

783
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
You stay here with Ms. Denby.
I'll go see what's up.

784
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,160
Cognac, Ms. Denby?

785
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,720
No. No, thank you.

786
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,080
What's the matter? What's all the racket?

787
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
I got him, I tell you! I got him!

788
00:45:58,235 --> 00:45:59,045
You got him? Got who?

789
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,960
- Yes, the Gorilla! He's in there!
- He's in there!

790
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,320
- I can hear him breathe!
- That's you.

791
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,600
Well, open it, open it!

792
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,000
Have you men been drinking?

793
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,520
No, but it's a good idea.

794
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,480
What was that?

795
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,840
- Norma, what's happening?
- It's the Gorilla!

796
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,280
Norma, where are you?

797
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,720
Jack!

798
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,560
A couple of you get after 'em, quick!

799
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,080
- You heard 'em, Mulligan.
- So did you.

800
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,560
Nevermind, then. You take the hall.
I'll go this way.

801
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,640
I'll stay here.

802
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,200
- Is something wrong?
- Where were you?

803
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,920
- I just went to get some tea, sir.
- Didn't I tell you to stay here with Ms. Denby?

804
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,560
I'm very sorry, sir. But I thought that perhaps
a little tea...

805
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,440
What right have you got to think?
We're not even thinking!

806
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,960
Ms. Denby might've been killed.

807
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,640
It's fortunate she wasn't, sir.

808
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,240
Why is it that something always happens
when you're not here?

809
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,560
An unfortunate coincidence, sir.

810
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,760
- What did you find?
- An empty closet with Harrigan in it.

811
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,440
- Harrigan, Harrigan, Harrigan! Wake up.
- Get up.

812
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,160
- Wake up.
- The Gorilla, the Gorilla!

813
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,720
Did you get him? Did you get him?

814
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,760
- No, he got you.
- Well, it won't happen again.

815
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,920
- Okay, men. Follow me.
- Okay.

816
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,280
Follow me.

817
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,600
Go down and see where these stairs lead to.

818
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,840
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

819
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,080
- Oh, me!
- It's awful dark. I shoulda brung my glasses.

820
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,520
- You never wore any glasses.
- That's right. I forgot.

821
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,960
- What's that funny tapping?
- Yeah!

822
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,280
It's my knees.

823
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,800
It's a fine time to be scared!

824
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,840
- You try and think of a better time.
- Yeah, well...

825
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,320
Look, look.

826
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,880
I've had about enough of this!

827
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,040
Me and the Gorilla's gonna have a
showdown right now!

828
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,480
- That's right, chief.
- I'm telling you I can't stand it!

829
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,280
Now, don't argue with me!

830
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,960
I know what I'm talking about!

831
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,050
I'm going in there, 
and we'll look over this house.

832
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,280
And he'll take orders from me, understand?

833
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,320
I'm gonna tear this house apart!

834
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,720
Tear it limb from limb!

835
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,080
Now, come on, follow me!

836
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,960
I'll show this monk who's a monk!

837
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,000
You fellows stay close behind me.

838
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,160
If anything happens, leave it to me.

839
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,880
I'll do all the talking.

840
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,960
Come on, men.

841
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,080
People here running here to there all day.

842
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,400
All day long. I've never seen anything
like this in all my life.

843
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,360
First... Hey, where are you going?

844
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,160
What's eating you?

845
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,240
What've you got there?

846
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,320
That dame musta saw something or she
wouldn't be running away like that.

847
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
Make a note o' that, Garrity.

848
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,440
Garrity! Mulligan!

849
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,840
- Good evening.
- Good evening...

850
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,360
- What do you want?
- Don't be frightened.

851
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,200
Frightened? Who's frightened?

852
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,520
Don't you come near me! I'll wrap this
thing around your neck like it was a pretzel!

853
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,760
- There's nothing to worry about.
- That's what you think.

854
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,800
- May I give you some advice?
- No!

855
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,720
If I were you, I'd go to my room and stay there.

856
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,400
Why, yes, sir. I was just planning on that!

857
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,160
Wait a minute. Where have you been?

858
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,240
No place. Honest, sir! I was just getting
ready to go to town!

859
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,120
- Good.
- Don't open that!

860
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,360
- Why not?
- The Gorilla! He's in there!

861
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,880
Don't be silly.

862
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,640
- Get going now. Get going.
- Yes, sir. I'm practically there!

863
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,960
That ain't a man. It's a gorilla.
We saw it and we felt it!

864
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,040
I tell you, the Gorilla is a man. I ought
to know. I've read enough about him.

865
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,880
But how could a monkey possibly have
written those notes to Uncle Walter?

866
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,640
Maybe it's got an education.

867
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,040
Poe! Poe!

868
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,680
Poe! Where is he, have any of you seen him?

869
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,280
- Who?
- Poe.

870
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,200
- Who's Poe?
- Poe's the gorilla.

871
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,940
- The Gorilla?
- Oh, you know 'em, too, eh?

872
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,800
Know 'em? I trained 'em
since he was that high.

873
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,520
You're just the one we're looking for.

874
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,520
Don't any of you understand?
Poe is a gorilla, a trained gorilla.

875
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,640
- A real gorilla?
- Sure, a real gorilla.

876
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,120
Well, so we don't know what we're talking
about, eh?

877
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,320
Yeah, we know a monkey when we see one.

878
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,560
Listen, this is serious. Poe ain't no pet.

879
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,680
There's no telling what he's liable
to do when I ain't around.

880
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,120
'Specially with women. He hates women.

881
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,040
Well, what's he doing here?
What're you doing here?

882
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,080
We was hired to come here.
We're working at the County Fair.

883
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,960
Yesterday, a guy comes along, says
he wants me to bring Poe here.

884
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,600
He says he's giving a party,
wants us to put on our act.

885
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,280
- Who hired you?
- I don't know. I don't know nothing.

886
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,760
All I know is I bring Poe here, we're
waiting out in the garage like he tells me.

887
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,320
Waiting to do our stuff.

888
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:47,880
All of a sudden,

889
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:50,280
somebody gives me a clunk over the head
and I wake up in a lady's boudoir.

890
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,920
But the gorilla... how'd he get loose?

891
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,960
You're asking me! That's what I wanna find out.

892
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,360
Listen, this is serious. We gotta find 'em.

893
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,240
We gotta. Somebody's liable to get killed.

894
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,960
The note from the Gorilla!

895
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,720
Fall against your fifty, 
they were addressed to me!

896
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,080
Notes? Poe can't write no notes!

897
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,600
Even I don't know how to write.

898
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,720
Now, look. The next time I buck up 
against that gorilla...

899
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,720
I'm telling you, I'll...

900
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,920
Well, I'll...
He'll never know!

901
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,480
He'll do it!

902
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,960
- Listen, have you seen 'em?
- Yes, he's in the kitchen.

903
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,880
- Which way is the kitchen?
- Through the panel.

904
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,280
We'll go with you.

905
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,760
Listen, you fellows better wait here.
There's no telling what that ape'll do.

906
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,440
Oh, Jack, I'm so confused.

907
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,960
A real gorilla, and those notes, and...

908
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,080
Listen to me, everybody.

909
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,280
The Gorilla has done his work.

910
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,240
Walter Stevens is dead.

911
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,840
You will find his body in the garage.

912
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,960
Oh, Jack!

913
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,120
Alright, everybody. 
Follow me to the garage!

914
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,200
Come on.

915
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,360
- Come on.
- Come on.

916
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,480
He's gone! Poe's gone!

917
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,800
I tell you, he's in the kitchen!

918
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:00,000
The kitchen's a wreck. 
He must be on a rampage!

919
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,960
Outta my way, brother. I got my own
troubles to worry about.

920
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,200
Alright, all of you! 
Out in the garage! Come on!

921
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,760
I'll stay here and protect Ms. Denby.

922
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,360
This way, please.

923
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,720
I'll never forgive myself for not
calling the police.

924
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,400
Why call the police with us around, lady?

925
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,160
You couldn't save Uncle Walter.

926
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,160
We couldn't, eh?

927
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,800
- Well, you didn't, did you?
- Well, we...

928
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
That's right, we didn't.

929
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,200
I gotta find out how that gorilla
gets in and outta here.

930
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,720
There must be a secret spring
around here someplace.

931
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,200
I think I'll look in back o' these books.

932
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,320
Help!

933
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,680
Help!

934
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,560
Somebody! Get me outta here somebody!

935
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,600
Don't tell me she's the Gorilla!

936
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,240
I told you I didn't like her looks.

937
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,920
- Oh, wise guy!
- Come on, we gotta find the body.

938
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,560
- What'd I do with them keys?
- Look under the mat.

939
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,760
- That's funny!
- Oh, very funny. Will you get me out of here?

940
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,560
Listen, what're you doing in Poe's cage?

941
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,520
What do you think I'm doing, waiting for
somebody to feed me peanuts?

942
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,600
Get me outta here!

943
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,240
Don't you know Poe hates women?

944
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,440
So does Kipling. So what? Will you please
get me out of here?

945
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,880
Alright, don't get excited.

946
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,000
Say, wait a minute. I think this 
was a trick to get us outta the house.

947
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,000
Come on.

948
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,880
- Who are you anyway?
- I'm the gorilla's keeper!

949
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,540
Are you the one that gave me 
the clunk on the head?

950
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:28,640
No, but it was a good idea.

951
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,880
Oh, yeah?

952
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,640
Look!

953
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,760
- He's got her!
- Don't talk! He'll drop her!

954
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,000
Poe! Bring her down, Poe!

955
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,600
Bring her down to me!

956
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,800
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!

957
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,520
Put her down, Poe!

958
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,640
Down, Poe! Down to the ground!

959
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,640
Poe! Stop it, Poe!

960
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,400
Bring her down, Poe!

961
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
Bring her down to me!

962
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,040
Put her down, Poe.

963
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,400
Come on.

964
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,480
Poe, Poe, come back here! 
Help me catch him!

965
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,480
Oh, thank you, thank you.

966
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,680
He hit me again!

967
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,480
Right here, he hit...

968
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,520
Poe! Let him alone!

969
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,480
That's a fine way to treat me.

970
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,360
After I give you the 
best years of my life.

971
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,000
You act like that... Listen here.

972
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,800
No, no. No kisses.

973
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,600
He might have killed somebody!

974
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,920
What do you mean, might have?

975
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:28,960
That's alright, lady. I got him.

976
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,240
You can keep him!

977
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,120
Okay. Scram, but take this
character with you.

978
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,960
I was only kidding.

979
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,480
Just for that, he gets no c-a-n-d-y.

980
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,880
Oh, well, that's just c-a-n-d-y.

981
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,880
Sorry if I caused you any trouble, folks.

982
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,000
Yeah, and just for that, I won't
read you the funny papers tonight.

983
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,800
Put you in bed without any supper, 
you bad boy.

984
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,000
You wait'll I get you home!

985
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,000
You have heard the last of this!

986
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,240
Come on!

987
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:00,960
Look at that.

988
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,800
Why, it's somebody's coat!

989
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,400
Alright, come on outta there, buddy.

990
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,040
So that's how I got clunked on the head.

991
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,800
Come on, come on outta there, you!

992
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,320
Look! It's opening!

993
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,400
Come on, come on...

994
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,440
Oh, so it's you!

995
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,660
Do you know him?

996
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,360
Do I know him? He's the guy I caught
using the telephone!

997
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,760
- There's no law against that.
- Nevermind law, buddy. Get 'em up.

998
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,120
Now, just a minute. Don't you think 
you're a little premature?

999
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,440
Prema... Well, 
I can't remember that far back.

1000
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,960
Just who are you?

1001
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,720
I'm Detective Kletty.

1002
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,000
An investigator for the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

1003
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,600
And I'm on the trail of the Gorilla,
just as you are.

1004
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,480
- A detective?
- How do we know that?

1005
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,240
Yes, we...

1006
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,720
Yeah, well, what were you doing in there?

1007
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,040
Investigating. I've been on this case
for some weeks now.

1008
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,840
And I've discovered a little about
the construction of this house...

1009
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,280
...that my good friend here don't seem
to have found out yet.

1010
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,240
What do you mean?

1011
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,720
This house is a maze of secret panels.

1012
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,880
Now, undoubtedly, the voice of the Gorilla 

1013
01:00:00,881 --> 01:00:02,880
came through that radio from 
someplace right in this house.

1014
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,240
That means that if we find the wire 
leading away from the radio...

1015
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,960
We'd at least find the Gorilla's hideout!

1016
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,760
And what's going on here!

1017
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,600
Well, here it is.
Here's the wire going right in here.

1018
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,360
It's found.

1019
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,400
Now, let's see...

1020
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,360
Just as I thought!

1021
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,800
Here's the wire!

1022
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,000
Now, by tracing this, I think we may 
find the answer to this entire riddle.

1023
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,000
The wire goes in here.

1024
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,040
Back of this wall is the man we want.

1025
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,680
Now, make a note o' that, Garr...

1026
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,200
- Are you all armed?
- Yes, I'm armed.

1027
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,600
Quiet, you!

1028
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,800
Here it is.

1029
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,840
There's your microphone, and as I 
expected, there's your Gorilla.

1030
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,000
Mr. Stevens, the Gorilla?

1031
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,120
Why, sure, I could have told you that
all the time!

1032
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,480
I guess the party's over, 
my Gorilla friend.

1033
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,040
Yeah, but who tied 'em up like that?

1034
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,920
I don't know. He figured the game was
up and that this would throw off suspicion.

1035
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,040
This is a homemade job. 
A child could've done it.

1036
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,840
Ah, proposterous! Don't believe him!

1037
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,200
I never saw this man before in my life!
He's insane!

1038
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,120
Now, what's that?

1039
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,680
Why is it, with all the men in the house, 
they have to leave us here with you?

1040
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,560
Quiet!

1041
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,960
Why, it's Mr. Stevens!

1042
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,040
- Alias, the Gorilla.
- The Gorilla?

1043
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,960
Him?

1044
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,040
Oh, I'll never trust another man
if I live to be a thousand!

1045
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,560
You can make that two thousand.

1046
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,600
Uncle Walter, the Gorilla?

1047
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,680
I don't believe it!

1048
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,320
I think I can make it very clear.

1049
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,880
- Oh, sure we can!
- Now, first of all...

1050
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,960
- What's that?
- I didn't hear a thing!

1051
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,360
Neither did I, but what was it?

1052
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,320
We'll soon find out.

1053
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,800
Hey, what is this?

1054
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,960
Who hit me?

1055
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,400
What's going on around here?

1056
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,520
- It's that man again.
- Oh, there you are!

1057
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,920
Kidnapped! Kidnapped by the Gorilla!

1058
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,120
- Not kidnapped by the Gorilla, Mister...
- Conway. A.P. Conway.

1059
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,440
Ah, the A.P. stands for ape!

1060
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,720
Mr. Conway, this gentleman is the Gorilla!

1061
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,720
- The Gorilla?
- But if Uncle Walter's the Gorilla...

1062
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,000
...I don't understand why he should 
send himself those notes of warning.

1063
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,680
For two reasons!

1064
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,360
To keep you here and to throw off
suspicion from himself.

1065
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,840
Ms. Denby,

1066
01:02:16,841 --> 01:02:19,840
under the terms of your father's will,
if anything were to happen to you...

1067
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,480
...who would inherit your estate?

1068
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,840
Uncle Walter.

1069
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,040
My hunch was right.

1070
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,320
Your uncle brought you here tonight
to kill you for your money.

1071
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,200
Well, at least he had a reason!

1072
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,360
So that's why he wouldn't 
let us call the police.

1073
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,600
That's exactly why.

1074
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,560
But what about these men,
these private detectives?

1075
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,800
They almost speak for themselves.

1076
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,040
Do you think if Stevens life 
had actually been threatened...

1077
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,360
...he would've called in three morons 
such as these for protection?

1078
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,480
- Protection...
- Morons!

1079
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,240
Hey! Wait a minute, I resent that!

1080
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,440
But I tell you, I saw the Gorilla! Right there 
in that closet! I saw his hand, then his arm

1081
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,120
and it was no optical confusion!

1082
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,440
What you saw was this sleeve!

1083
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,880
Another ingenious little invention of 
Mr. Stevens.

1084
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,600
A very cute little idea!

1085
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,000
Well, that about clears the whole matter up.

1086
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,040
And since it's stopped raining, 
I think I better go.

1087
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,440
- You're okay, buddy!
- You're okay!

1088
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,200
Congratulations! Let me congratulate you!
You were wonderful!

1089
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,520
Oh, no you don't, buddy! Okay, folks.
Say howdy to the Gorilla!

1090
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,080
Howdy. 

1091
01:03:25,581 --> 01:03:28,280
Alright, give out or this moron is
gonna blow your brains out.

1092
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,080
Well, you see...

1093
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,240
Now, all of you stick your hands up.

1094
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,960
I'm the Gorilla, alright.

1095
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,720
But the cops haven't been able to get me, 
so don't you halfwits get any crazy notions.

1096
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,360
And as for Mr. Stevens, he's just as
crooked as I told you he was.

1097
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,000
The trouble with him is he
talks too much and too loud.

1098
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,360
I got tipped off on what was gonna
happen here tonight.

1099
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,360
How he was gonna pretend to be me!

1100
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,960
How he was gonna get the two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars and at the same time...

1101
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,960
...let him get the blame for
all the Gorilla murders.

1102
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,560
We were careful.

1103
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,205
I'm a little nervous tonight.

1104
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,640
Drop that gun. And I advise you not to move.

1105
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,760
Hello? Police station, quickly.

1106
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,800
What is this?
I thought the phone was out of order!

1107
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:13,320
- Maybe he paid his bill.
- Hello?

1108
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,920
This is Walter Stevens speaking.

1109
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,920
Send a squad car to my house.

1110
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,280
We've got the Gorilla.

1111
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,160
Things are so mixed-up around here that even 
the Gorilla doesn't know who the Gorilla is!

1112
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,040
He's the Gorilla, he's the Gorilla.
Do I know what I'm doing?

1113
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,600
Look, what's going on here?

1114
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:33,200
Don't look so sad, darling. Your uncle isn't 
a crook! The estate's all safe and sound now.

1115
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,440
You know, you never can tell. This is liable
to wind up to be a mystery!

1116
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,360
You see, the Gorilla murders were threatening 
to bankrupt our insurance company.

1117
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,480
Most of the victims were clients of ours.

1118
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,560
So Conway, our special investigator, cooked up
his little scheme to trap the killer.

1119
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,680
I'm sorry I had to frighten you, dear.

1120
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,120
- And you, too, Kitty.
- Oh, I wasn't frightened. I was numb.

1121
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,040
You fellows are certainly great detectives.

1122
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,040
- Oh, yes.
- We could have told you that!

1123
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,480
Did you know that Kletty was the Gorilla 
all along?

1124
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,320
- Sure we did!
- No, we didn't.

1125
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,880
When did you find out he was the Gorilla?

1126
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,160
When I shook hands with him.

1127
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,440
- I don't get you.
- Well, you see, I was a window trimmer.

1128
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:05,800
In a department store.

1129
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,240
And I oughtta know a phony feel 
when I feel one.

1130
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,880
We'll never be able to thank you, 
Mr. Harrigan.

1131
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,480
Oh, well, that's alright. I understand 
you two are getting married soon.

1132
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,280
Well, if you call tomorrow soon...

1133
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,760
Well remember, if you have any trouble with her, 
our specialty is following wives!

1134
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,960
You know where to send the check.
And be sure it's certified.

1135
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,040
From a detective's bank.

1136
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,360
- Bye.
- Bye.

1137
01:05:37,305 --> 01:06:37,368
