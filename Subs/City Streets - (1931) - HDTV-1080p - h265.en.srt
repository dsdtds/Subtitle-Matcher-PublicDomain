00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,195
Hey, you got to admit, it's a
pretty swell-looking layout.

3
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,587
- I'll buy.
- Yeah?

4
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,711
But I can't do nothing
until the big fella gets here.

5
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:28,562
Here he comes now. He's the boss, you know.

6
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,047
Hello, Big Fella. How's tricks?

7
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,473
- Well, how about it?
- Sold.

8
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:48,959
But you're lucky you're getting paid for it.

9
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,096
You ain't got no right on this
side of the river anyway.

10
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:56,130
No hard feelings.

11
00:02:57,471 --> 00:02:59,497
No, sure not.

12
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,200
- I'm moving my mob in tomorrow.
- Ok, tomorrow.

13
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,591
No hard feelings.

14
00:05:46,352 --> 00:05:48,628
Nobody can hit nothing
with this piece of tin.

15
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:53,265
- Now what do you want Poppa to hit?
- You ain't hit anything yet.

16
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,158
Try the ceiling, aim straight up.

17
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,659
Hey, look out. What do
you think you're doing?

18
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:05,426
- I guess I know what I'm aiming at.
- You may be, but not with your head.

19
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,919
I'm aiming at that little duck
over in the corner.

20
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:12,950
By the way you're shooting Mister,
I'd rather you aimed at me.

21
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:17,949
You can't hit anything with that.

22
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:23,575
You do it for me. Come on, show me.

23
00:06:55,859 --> 00:07:00,866
Showing off again.
Shooting all my profits away.

24
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:02,866
Every cent I make.

25
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:05,667
That's what you do every time I turn my back.

26
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:10,214
Why, you'll pay for every one
of them out of your salary.

27
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,631
And the next time you are
caught shooting, you are fired.

28
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:18,719
- Where you going?
- Supper.

29
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:19,914
Alright...

30
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:23,644
but see that you're back in half an hour.

31
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,890
Alright boys, see how good you can shoot.

32
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,751
Would he really fire you?

33
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,909
No, he's just like an old bull
we used to had back on the ranch.

34
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,350
He stamps around a lot,
but he hasn't got any horns.

35
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:42,013
- Hi, Nelly.
- Hi there Kid.

36
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,033
I almost wish he would fire you.

37
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:46,272
How's that?

38
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:52,766
Then you could get into a
regular act, something good.

39
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:56,362
You're in your usual number again?

40
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:00,195
You think you're pretty tall
and smart, don't you?

41
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,069
Come here.

42
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,713
That's what you really look like.

43
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:10,046
Yeah? Take a look at yourself.

44
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:15,054
I don't look like that. Let me go.

45
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:34,481
- Aren't you going to get any supper?
- I'd not hunger.

46
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,788
Well, I am, I'm starved.

47
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:39,328
- Want a weenie?
- May help.

48
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:41,269
- How many?
- Two.

49
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,101
Well, I can't eat two.

50
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,575
I didn't think you do.

51
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,492
- Elephant.
- You again?

52
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:32,865
Say, listen Kid, I've had about
enough of you round here.

53
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,772
This ain't even for a person anyway.

54
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,126
Didn't I tell you about that guy before?

55
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:43,190
You oughtn't be wasting your
dough in these joints.

56
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,543
- I won something, didn't I?
- Another elephant.

57
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,430
- Don't you want it?
- Sure.

58
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,465
- Thank you.
- That's alright.

59
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,424
Gosh, is great.

60
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,973
It sure is.

61
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,083
I love it when is really rough...

62
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,915
And the big ones come tearing in.

63
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,792
I remember summers, it is a mile high.

64
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:14,978
And when they hit...

65
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:17,140
Boy.

66
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:19,889
I got all soaked.

67
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:24,242
- Gee, was swell.
- Yeah, I know.

68
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,518
I used to want to be a sailor before I
made up my mind about the circus.

69
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,681
You sure go for jobs with no dough.

70
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,278
There is plenty of money in the circus.

71
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,677
I can shoot and throw a
rope and do trick-riding.

72
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:39,931
I used to ride some pretty tough
broncs back on the ranch.

73
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:42,972
Yeah, you'll probably get stranded
again the way you did with the rodeo.

74
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:46,034
Only next time maybe you won't
even land with a Top-gun joint.

75
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:48,918
Money isn't everything.

76
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,680
People use it sometimes to get married on.

77
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,965
Don't you worry, I'm going to make
plenty of money for both of us.

78
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,368
Oh Kid, why won't you let me talk to Pop?

79
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,157
He could put you in right.

80
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:02,848
Doing what?

81
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:04,167
Beer.

82
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,916
I wouldn't like that kind of work.

83
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:10,286
It isn't work...

84
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:12,800
You just go round and
collect from saps that do.

85
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,805
That's all Pop does.
And he's always got a big roll.

86
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:18,567
Gee, you could be smarter than him.

87
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:22,883
We could've cars and servants and everything.

88
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,462
I wish you weren't in that racket.

89
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,035
You'd have different ideas about things.

90
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,145
Where your ideas got you?

91
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,346
We can't even afford to get married.

92
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,563
If you love me you'd marry me anyway.

93
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:39,409
Yeah and live in a tent.

94
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:42,551
Why not?

95
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,110
I don't like tents.

96
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:47,872
It isn't the tents.

97
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:49,920
It's me.

98
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:55,053
You don't really love me.

99
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:56,314
Don't be a sap.

100
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:58,745
I want to see you make something of yourself.

101
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:03,510
A racketeer like that stepfather of yours.

102
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:05,585
What's the matter with racketeers?

103
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,228
Anyway, they're smart.

104
00:13:08,148 --> 00:13:09,127
They're not dumb...

105
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,063
like somebody I know.

106
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,001
Yeah?

107
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:18,426
Well then, why don't
you get yourself a racketeer.

108
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,507
Well, maybe I will.

109
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,872
Go ahead, you big dummy.

110
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:41,696
Wait a minute.

111
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:52,404
- That's yours.
- Thanks.

112
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:58,068
- Oh Kid Kid I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
- Yes you did.

113
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:01,166
- Why, I didn't Kid, honest I didn't.
- Yes, you did. You think I'm a sap.

114
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:03,497
Of course I do Kid, but
I love you on the level.

115
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:04,206
No you don't.

116
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:06,179
- Yes I do, I do.
- I don't believe you.

117
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:07,306
I do.

118
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:08,833
- I do love you.
- I don't believe you.

119
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,043
- No you don't.
- I do.

120
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:12,040
I love you, love you.

121
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,172
Gee...

122
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:31,970
I got to get back.

123
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:34,094
Gosh, your late too. Happened before.

124
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,526
- Meet me when the shooting gallery closes?
- Yeah.

125
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,984
Pop got to go out, but
I'll be back at 22 o'clock.

126
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,653
- Hello.
- Come here.

127
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,501
Come here.

128
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:49,883
Where you've been?

129
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,344
Where you been?

130
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,930
I said where you've been.

131
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,109
Out with that shooting gallery mug again?

132
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,017
Answer me.

133
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,802
Come on. Spill it.

134
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,049
Good kid.

135
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,663
You'll never tell nobody nothing.

136
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:15,717
Here...

137
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,359
for keeping your trap shut.

138
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,180
A good kid.

139
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:21,585
Yeah, I got to go over to Blackie.

140
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,646
Stick around, till I get back.

141
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:27,641
Lay off.

142
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,829
Is mine.

143
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:33,449
You picked yourself a big-shot alright.

144
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,369
Go ahead, laugh.

145
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,944
He may not be a big-shot but he can
shoot better than anybody in this mob.

146
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:40,971
Yeah?

147
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,390
I saw him shoot a cigar
out of a guy's mouth, once...

148
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,250
when the guy got fresh.

149
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,089
Cigar? You don't say.

150
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:04,028
Jackie ain't sung a tune all day.
I'm worried about it.

151
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:51,083
Well, goodnight, Blackie.

152
00:17:56,402 --> 00:18:00,453
- Get in there, you.
- Ah, don't get sore, Blackie.

153
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,643
It was just a good-night kiss.

154
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,773
A goodbye kiss, you mean.

155
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,043
Oh, you don't scare me.

156
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,309
Just because you're running this Mob,

157
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:13,421
don't mean you can pull anything like that.

158
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:14,717
Forget it.

159
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,430
It didn't mean nothing.

160
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:19,066
No hard feelings.

161
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:21,647
No...

162
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:24,739
not as long as you stay away from my girl.

163
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,336
Hello, Big Fella. How tricks?

164
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,440
Hey Pop...

165
00:19:05,094 --> 00:19:08,917
If anything happened to Blackie, do you
think you could hold his mob together?

166
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:12,944
Sure.

167
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,118
It'd suit me better.

168
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,623
You've a nice sunny disposition.

169
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:20,044
I'd be willing to do business with you...

170
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,816
if anything happened to Blackie.

171
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,534
Thanks for the confidence in me, Big Fella.

172
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:25,192
Hello, Blackie, how things?

173
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,482
Hello, Aggie. How is trick?

174
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,059
- What's been keeping you?
- Me? Nothing. Why?

175
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,661
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

176
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,690
I'll be with you in a minute.

177
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,649
You little bum, you.

178
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:45,872
Use your phone?

179
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:06,116
Say, listen, Babe.

180
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,785
Blackie and me is just going over to Joe's.

181
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,242
Meet me around the
corner from there in 25 minutes

182
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:13,340
if you have to break your arm to get there.

183
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:16,139
I said...

184
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,517
if you have to break your arm to get there.

185
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,358
Yeah.

186
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:55,141
Anything wrong, sweetheart?

187
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:02,027
He better stop slapping me around
or he's going to get his some day.

188
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,283
Suppose he don't live that long?

189
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:15,151
It'd be alright with you, wouldn't it?

190
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,795
I don't hear you saying no.

191
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,090
You know, it's tough
keeping the ash on a cigar...

192
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:38,079
If you don't keep smoking them, they go out.

193
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,589
And the ash drops off.

194
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,800
- Ready?
- Hey...

195
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,881
You didn't happen to run into the
big fella on your way in, did you?

196
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:54,888
No.

197
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,233
See you soon, Aggie.

198
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,803
- I think I'll carry your rod for tonight.
- Ah?

199
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,138
What's up?

200
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:47,717
- Have I done anything?
- No, not yet.

201
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:51,189
Come on, get it out.

202
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:54,042
What kind of a bodyguard does that make me?

203
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,053
Well, Come on.

204
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:42,957
- I ain't going in there.
- Eh? Why not?

205
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,577
What's the good of me without a rod?

206
00:24:52,178 --> 00:24:54,329
I ain't taking any chances tonight.

207
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,770
Now, listen Blackie...

208
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:01,569
you know the big fella wouldn't try
to put the fix on you through me.

209
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,687
- No?
- No.

210
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,593
Not him, nor nobody else.

211
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,677
They know what I think of you.

212
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,193
- Alright.
- Thanks.

213
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:26,842
Everything Ok?

214
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,180
- I guess so.
- No hard feelings.

215
00:25:29,214 --> 00:25:29,943
No.

216
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:32,825
What's the idea.
Let go of my hand. Let go of my hand.

217
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,799
What's happening?

218
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:50,538
In the river.

219
00:26:58,314 --> 00:26:59,418
Hey, you.

220
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:03,218
What do you know about this murder?

221
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:04,800
What murder?

222
00:27:06,043 --> 00:27:08,444
Well, a fellow got bumped off back there.

223
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:11,864
And the guy passed his gun to a girl.

224
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:15,300
Oh, I saw a girl running down the street.

225
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,699
Oh, you did? Which way did she go?

226
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:20,568
She went down that street.

227
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:23,098
Oh?

228
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:25,973
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

229
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:43,211
Why, Blackie and me was pals.

230
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:46,058
I'd like to get the guy who did it, myself.

231
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,646
You ain't figuring on suicide, are you?

232
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:49,988
Oh, lay off.

233
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,463
- Why Pop and Blackie was just like that.
- Yeah?

234
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:58,000
- Just like that when you give it to him.
- Me?

235
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,424
Why he went out before I got here.

236
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,788
I've just been sitting here playing
checkers with Aggie and...

237
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,441
- smoking.
- That's right.

238
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:07,958
Yeah?

239
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,717
- For how long?
- Oh...

240
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,223
Half an hour.

241
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:43,063
- Why don't you get wise Sister?
- We're your friends.

242
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:50,567
Everybody knows you didn't kill him.
So why not spill who did?

243
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:55,068
The Inspector would still give you a break.

244
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:05,818
We're just trying
to give you the right steer.

245
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:13,300
Well, how about it?

246
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:20,002
Decided to come through
with who gave you that gun?

247
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:23,921
No?

248
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,050
Ok...

249
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:32,520
possession of the gun makes you
an accessory-after-the-fact anyway.

250
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:39,241
Listen sweetheart, why
get left with an empty sack.

251
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,945
Why take the rap for Cooley?

252
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,747
You want to do a couple
of years up the river for him?

253
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:49,020
He turn you in.

254
00:29:50,895 --> 00:29:53,114
It was Cooley, wasn't it?

255
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:54,756
Told you Pop isn't in this.

256
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:56,535
Well...

257
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:58,839
Maybe not.

258
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:03,098
- Bring Cooley in.
- Yes sir.

259
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:15,892
Well, Cooley, I guess
this is once you'll come clear.

260
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,698
She says you're out of it,
so I'm letting you go.

261
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:22,367
But I'm holding her unless
she'll spill who gave her that gun.

262
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,038
Don't hold out on the Inspector, Babe.

263
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:28,734
I'll leave you two alone.

264
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,585
Maybe you can make
her see what's good for her.

265
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,958
Sure, she'll listen to Pop.

266
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,569
Won't you, Babe?

267
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:40,428
Listen Pop, I was...

268
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,515
The Inspector is right, Babe.

269
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:46,335
Think it over.

270
00:30:46,893 --> 00:30:49,101
You should tell him all you know about this.

271
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,182
Never hold anything out
on the Inspector, Babe.

272
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:58,068
Probably a plant, dictograph.

273
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,638
Safer to talk this way.

274
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,625
Play ball with them babe,
they let you take a plea.

275
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,809
Sit tight, keep your trap shut.
I'll get you out of this.

276
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:11,409
- The mob will stick by you.
- Pop, I was to meet The Kid at 22 o'clock.

277
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,254
You go to him, tell him.

278
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,424
So you won't even answer me, eh?

279
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,338
You'll never do a day's time.

280
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,629
Trust Pop.

281
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:22,952
You play ball and the mob won't let you down.

282
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:25,373
Gee Pop, supposing they do send me up...

283
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,428
I won't see The Kid maybe
for an awful long time.

284
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,994
Forget it. Don't squawk.

285
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:32,138
Nobody in the beer racket
ever welshed out on a pal yet.

286
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:36,571
What you doing traveling around
with that West Side mob, anyhow?

287
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:40,532
Pop, he might get troubled
being in a spot like this.

288
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:42,394
Tell him I love him Pop.

289
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:43,808
No matter what happens.

290
00:31:44,156 --> 00:31:47,580
Be sure and tell him, I love him.

291
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:51,573
Sure, but don't you spill nothing to
that cop, I don't care what he promises.

292
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,767
Keep your shirt on. I won't.

293
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:56,206
Well, how about it?

294
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:57,630
Just drool.

295
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:05,015
Open now Babe, tell the Inspector...

296
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:07,659
Nice view you got from here, Inspector.

297
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:09,470
Glad you like it.

298
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,447
You'll probably see it plenty more times.

299
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:15,665
Why, you act as if I
wasn't trying to do you a favor.

300
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:17,677
Could I help it if she won't talk?

301
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:22,851
You know how kids are nowadays, they ain't
got no respect for parents or the law or...

302
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,212
Alright, alright, clear out a here.

303
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:28,055
But don't kid yourself I want to let you go.

304
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,268
There's a shyster with a writ for you
downstairs, so I've got to do it.

305
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:35,576
The law don't look so good when
it works both ways, eh Inspector?

306
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:38,324
Goodbye Pop.

307
00:32:38,806 --> 00:32:43,426
- Goodbye, Babe. See you soon.
- Maybe not so soon as you think.

308
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:53,708
What you worried about
the time for, sweetheart?

309
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:59,111
Where you're going,
you'll have plenty to spare.

310
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,969
Hello Kid. Still open?

311
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:23,024
- Where's Nan?
- I don't know.

312
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,139
Try one Mac.

313
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,200
Get that cigarette over there.

314
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:59,177
Say...

315
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,654
they tell me you shoot
pretty good, is that right?

316
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,056
I shoot some.

317
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:05,525
Well, go ahead and show us what you can do.

318
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:18,502
Oh boy.

319
00:34:21,237 --> 00:34:24,355
- Ah, what's funny?
- That you couldn't even hit it.

320
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,079
I can hit you.

321
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,289
Your initial?

322
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,193
Hey, give me that.

323
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,874
Right over the bump.

324
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,729
Say, you...

325
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:47,771
Say, listen Kid...

326
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,583
Why don't you get out
of this dime-a-throw racket?

327
00:34:52,028 --> 00:34:53,951
I can use a guy that can shoot like you.

328
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:55,958
- Beer?
- Yeah.

329
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,379
- No.
- Why?

330
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,367
A man tried to sell me that number,
too, but it was no sale...

331
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,190
I'd just as soon be a cop, as that.

332
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,329
Oh, you would.

333
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,278
What would say if I told you
the cops framed Nan?

334
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:11,762
What do you mean?

335
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,472
They got her down at Headquarters.

336
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,228
- What for?
- Nothing.

337
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:18,469
A guy gets bumped off and
they plant the gun on her.

338
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,016
- The police did?
- Yeah.

339
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:22,695
That's cops for you.

340
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:25,232
But let's go up there.

341
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:27,236
- I got to see her.
- Not a chance.

342
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:28,737
They wouldn't let you see her.

343
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,457
Besides, she wants you to keep out of this.

344
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,544
But somebody is got to do something.

345
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,964
- Get her out.
- Not so easy.

346
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:37,997
Takes money.

347
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,515
Lots of it.

348
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,577
Big lawyers and expenses.

349
00:35:43,063 --> 00:35:44,042
Have you got any?

350
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,621
Me?

351
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:46,929
No.

352
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,801
Well, I'm willing to do
all I can but it ain't enough.

353
00:35:50,923 --> 00:35:52,050
Don't you want to help?

354
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:53,371
Yeah, but...

355
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,839
I haven't got any money.

356
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,129
Now, listen...

357
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:58,977
Why not play along with me?

358
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,712
You can make a lot of dough
in the beer business.

359
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:03,760
We can work together to get Nan out, see.

360
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:07,478
Well, what will I have to do?

361
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,189
Just pack around with me, I'll show you.

362
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,610
Here, take this and keep it on you.

363
00:36:14,677 --> 00:36:15,804
What do you afraid of?

364
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:19,253
You won't have to shoot anybody.

365
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,252
Don't you want to help Nan?

366
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:24,190
Yeah...

367
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:25,527
But...

368
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,078
Alright.

369
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:31,300
Good boy.

370
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:34,099
Nan will be tickled to death.

371
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,341
When they open those gates and let me out.

372
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,964
Johnnie is going to be
sitting there waiting for me.

373
00:37:23,996 --> 00:37:25,862
- He promised.
- Yeah.

374
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:28,564
Pop promised I wouldn't do a day in stir.

375
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,130
I'm doing it, ain't I?

376
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:32,653
Oh, well, you got a dirty deal.

377
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,053
Johnnie never pull a thing like that.

378
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,997
Look up and see me laughing
when you don't find him there.

379
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:40,458
And If I wave my handkerchief you're wrong.

380
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,659
I won't be.

381
00:37:42,624 --> 00:37:44,570
They all leave you holding the bag.

382
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:46,636
Oh, I know the line they gave you.

383
00:37:46,793 --> 00:37:49,581
Play ball with us Babe and
the mob will stick by you.

384
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:52,007
They never welsh
out on you in the beer racket.

385
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,984
I know, believe me.

386
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,417
They can all kiss my foot when I get out.

387
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,687
Well, I rather have a guy
in the beer racket...

388
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:03,196
- than a circus act.
- That's what I thought.

389
00:38:03,465 --> 00:38:06,025
I thought the mob stuck
by you if you didn't squawk.

390
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:09,356
Now I'm glad The Kid
ain't mixed up with them.

391
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:10,921
With mugs like that.

392
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:43,053
- What's that?
- I don't see anything.

393
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:46,165
What's that car doing there?

394
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:50,137
Hijackers.

395
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:52,401
I better stop before they give it to us.

396
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:55,201
No, turn your lights off. Keep rolling.

397
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:56,403
Step on it.

398
00:39:06,228 --> 00:39:07,400
Keep on rolling.

399
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,602
- I've come for Esther March.
- Alright.

400
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:43,220
A party for Esther March.

401
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:52,837
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

402
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,300
She's waving. Johnnie alright.

403
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,463
Long may she wave.

404
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:11,398
Oh Johnnie. Johnnie,
Johnnie, what's the matter?

405
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:15,023
Talk to me Johnnie. Better get the...

406
00:40:33,905 --> 00:40:36,079
I thought there was something funny about it.

407
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,610
Poor Johnnie.

408
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:41,985
That's being Johnnie-on-the-spot alright.

409
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:44,743
They all get it, sooner or later.

410
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:50,198
Your lucky your boyfriend isn't
mixed up in the booze racket.

411
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:52,267
Don't know I know it.

412
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:08,828
4753.

413
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:12,254
It's no use the rest of you
people waiting, it's nearly 4 now.

414
00:41:12,282 --> 00:41:13,739
I've been waiting so long.

415
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:17,468
Well, I'm sorry, it isn't my fault if
we've had such a crowded day.

416
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:19,537
Better hurry, you only have a minute.

417
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:06,500
- Is swell seeing you.
- Well, is great seeing you.

418
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,928
- Boy, you're good to see.
- And you too, Babe.

419
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,139
Yet...

420
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:18,246
I wish...

421
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:22,647
What?

422
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,505
I wish I could just touch you.

423
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:29,948
Babe...

424
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:37,535
Oh Kid...

425
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:45,705
See...

426
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,431
I thought you might never come.

427
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:53,250
I had to tell them that we're married
or they wouldn't let me see you.

428
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:57,127
- Did you? Did you say that?
- And how.

429
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,107
- Have you missed me?
- I'll say I have.

430
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:12,205
Kid...

431
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,307
What have you done to yourself?

432
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,285
Do you like my get-up?

433
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:20,876
- The circus is in town?
- Not much.

434
00:43:22,592 --> 00:43:23,571
Say...

435
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:27,663
Oh, gee, you must be come up in the world.

436
00:43:28,248 --> 00:43:30,717
- I'll say I have.
- Doing what?

437
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,356
Beer.

438
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:39,106
Beer?

439
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,200
I'm working with Pop.

440
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:44,073
Pop?

441
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:45,847
Oh Kid.

442
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:57,239
You had it right, Babe.
It's great, I love it.

443
00:43:57,627 --> 00:44:00,406
Oh, don't kid me please.

444
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:02,818
I'm not. What's the matter with you?

445
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:08,613
- No, no, no, it can't be true, it mustn't.
- Why, I thought you'd be tickled to death.

446
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:12,127
- Oh Kid Kid...
- Time is up.

447
00:44:14,004 --> 00:44:15,449
Sorry, but you came late.

448
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:19,825
- Just a minute please.
- No, I'm sorry.

449
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,525
Goodbye Nan.

450
00:44:31,147 --> 00:44:33,525
I'll be waiting outside for you
when you come out.

451
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:36,157
- Come along, come along.
- Goodbye Kid.

452
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:38,895
Goodbye.

453
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,977
You must've come up in the world.

454
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,020
I certainly have.

455
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:37,888
Doing what?

456
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:40,802
Beer.

457
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:42,576
Beer?

458
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:45,868
- I'm working with Pop.
- Oh Kid.

459
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:47,103
No, no.

460
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:48,772
Is great.

461
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,653
- I love it.
- Oh, no Kid. No.

462
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,836
Time is up.

463
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,269
- You certainly had it right, Babe.
- Time is up.

464
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:57,286
It's great.

465
00:45:57,576 --> 00:46:00,228
- I love it.
- No Kid, no.

466
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:01,657
Come along, come along.

467
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:05,112
Lucky your boyfriend isn't
mixed up in the booze racket.

468
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:06,912
Beer.

469
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:08,271
I love it.

470
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:12,100
That's being Johnnie-on-the-spot alright.

471
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,656
- Beer.
- Johnnie-on-the-spot.

472
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:17,424
It can't be true, can't.

473
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:20,736
You had it right.

474
00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:00,151
- A party for Nan Cooley.
- Alright Nan.

475
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:32,578
- How do you like it?
- Swell.

476
00:48:40,194 --> 00:48:44,222
- Hello, you must be Nan.
- Yeah, to my friends.

477
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,770
- Then it is to me.
- You know the big fella, don't you?

478
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,192
OH, no, she doesn't.

479
00:48:49,812 --> 00:48:52,623
But she will. I'm glad to see you out.

480
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:56,096
You know, you're a lucky mug Kid.

481
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:03,386
Hot stuff, eh Chief?

482
00:49:03,848 --> 00:49:04,827
Red hot.

483
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:09,635
- See, what did I tell you?
- Yeah?

484
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:12,034
It's a swell joint alright.

485
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:15,155
Nan baby you're looking Ok.

486
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:17,386
- I'm alright.
- Well, what's eating you?

487
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:19,968
You ain't sore? Not at Pop.

488
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:22,407
Can the Pop stuff. Sell it
to somebody who wants it.

489
00:49:22,435 --> 00:49:25,769
Now, is that any way to talk,
and me so glad to see you?

490
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:26,783
Yeah.

491
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:28,747
What did you do to get me out?

492
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:30,967
He did everything he could, I know he did.

493
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:33,562
Sure. Oh Pansy...

494
00:49:35,135 --> 00:49:37,309
Pansy.

495
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:53,819
She's your new Mom.

496
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:55,714
Oh, I'm glad to meet the family.

497
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:58,678
- Be yourself, I'm dieting.
- Don't let Nan get your goat.

498
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:01,408
Oh, I don't blame her.
Going up the river is no picnic.

499
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:02,485
I thought you'd gone.

500
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,256
- Hey, I have an idea.
- They must be giving them away.

501
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:08,032
I'm giving a party for Nan.

502
00:50:08,596 --> 00:50:11,418
Tomorrow night at the Club Villa,
so the mob can meet her.

503
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,433
- Coming-out party?
- That's right.

504
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,704
- What do you say?
- I'm tired.

505
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,165
It do you good.

506
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:19,234
Thanks Chief, we'll be there.

507
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:21,248
Mighty nice of you to do that for Nan.

508
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:23,945
I'll do a lot more for you too.

509
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:25,408
How do you spell it?

510
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:27,019
T - W - O?

511
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:31,327
Well, I'll see you tomorrow night. Goodbye.

512
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:34,304
Oh Nan, we got a lot
of swell dresses for you.

513
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:35,921
Pansy picked them out herself.

514
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:38,368
Come on Pop, you and me got a date.

515
00:50:38,408 --> 00:50:39,205
What for?

516
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:42,390
- To buy a new dress for the party.
- But you got lots of new dresses.

517
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:46,101
Oh Pop. Don't be mean to Pansy.

518
00:50:46,683 --> 00:50:49,369
Ain't she clever to speak of answers?

519
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:56,632
Why don't you like
the big fella? He's a great guy.

520
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:58,495
Yeah? Well, I know better.

521
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:01,212
Oh Kid, let's not go to that party tomorrow.

522
00:51:01,243 --> 00:51:03,417
Let's drop this mob, before anything happens.

523
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,513
I thought we settled all that out in the car.

524
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,042
If you call not listening
to me, settling anything.

525
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,737
- Kiss me.
- Let's both beat it tonight.

526
00:51:11,716 --> 00:51:12,388
Kiss me.

527
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,534
Kid, there's going to be trouble, I know it.

528
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:15,811
Let's be sensible.

529
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:17,393
That's what I am being.

530
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,303
Mighty sensible.

531
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:32,147
Get a load of the big fella.
He's all steamed up.

532
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:34,526
Yes, he sure is.

533
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,414
And is it a burn-up for The Kid. Oh boy.

534
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:42,145
That brat of yours is certainly a queer one.

535
00:52:42,303 --> 00:52:45,683
She's got The big fella out
on his feet and don't like it.

536
00:52:45,835 --> 00:52:46,814
She'll learn.

537
00:52:47,113 --> 00:52:50,185
Oh, stop worrying about The Kid, Baby.

538
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,948
I just don't want to dance
with you all the time.

539
00:52:54,352 --> 00:52:55,888
Can't you give The Kid a break?

540
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,849
At least let me sit with him for a while.

541
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:02,827
I will give him all the break he needs.

542
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,771
Hey Baldy, Come on, sit down.

543
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,861
Sorry old man, but this is my chair here.

544
00:53:38,895 --> 00:53:39,874
No, it isn't.

545
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,127
But this is my lady's wrap here.

546
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:44,821
Well, you can have that, we don't need it.

547
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,559
Pick that up.

548
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:53,912
Pick that up, I said.

549
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:23,093
Let's have another dance.

550
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:27,427
- No, thank you, but if you don't mind...
- Oh, no excuses. Come on.

551
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:29,472
Really I don't...

552
00:54:33,109 --> 00:54:36,625
And if you start anything, you'll
get more than a fork in your hand.

553
00:54:42,689 --> 00:54:45,670
He must know about us.
We're going to get married.

554
00:54:45,766 --> 00:54:47,394
That's more of a reason...

555
00:54:48,527 --> 00:54:50,496
He wants to show you where you get off.

556
00:54:52,426 --> 00:54:54,497
You're getting too big in this mob.

557
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:02,458
- I thought, I thought you and him were...
- Yeah.

558
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:04,219
Were...

559
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:07,372
Until he got a look at her.

560
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:12,090
She better lay off him or...

561
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,017
I can make you very happy, Baby.

562
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:20,116
You could have everything.

563
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,720
A car of your own...

564
00:55:25,027 --> 00:55:28,088
Chauffeur and all the clothes you can buy.

565
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:31,671
No thanks, not tonight, or any otter night.

566
00:55:31,727 --> 00:55:33,593
Oh, think it over.

567
00:55:34,312 --> 00:55:36,065
I'll leave the offer open.

568
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:41,181
You think I'll change my mind, don't you?

569
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,291
Others have.

570
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:01,949
It's about my turn, isn't it?

571
00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:04,301
Oh Kid, I thought
you were never going to ask.

572
00:56:17,075 --> 00:56:18,737
Hey Pop...

573
00:56:24,322 --> 00:56:29,898
- That kid of yours made a big hit with me.
- Yeah, so I've noticed.

574
00:56:32,116 --> 00:56:34,676
- Any objections?
- No, sure not.

575
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,359
- But...
- But what?

576
00:56:37,669 --> 00:56:39,740
Well you know how it is with The Kid.

577
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,736
- He's pretty handy with that gat of his.
- Yeah?

578
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:48,165
- I take care of him.
- So could we Chief.

579
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:01,379
- The rest of this is mine.
- What's the idea?

580
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:04,406
We just started and I've been
dancing with you all evening.

581
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:06,699
- But I want this one too.
- No you don't.

582
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,631
Oh, who do you think you're talking to?

583
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:10,649
Come on, Baby.

584
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,464
Wait a minute.

585
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:15,160
Hey, trying to get tough?

586
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:18,407
Nobody takes my girl
away from me, not even you.

587
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:19,647
Get that?

588
00:57:28,647 --> 00:57:29,626
Ok.

589
00:57:31,334 --> 00:57:32,779
No hard feelings.

590
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:41,858
Get off the floor,
what's the matter with you?

591
00:57:42,451 --> 00:57:44,499
Don't get excited, buddy.

592
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:50,105
Kid, you shouldn't have done that.
There'll be trouble.

593
00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:53,607
- I can take care of myself.
- Blackie didn't do any more than you did.

594
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:56,645
Nobody is taking you away
from me, Blackie or no Blackie.

595
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:58,200
Well, forget it.

596
00:58:01,286 --> 00:58:02,595
What's the matter?

597
00:58:14,732 --> 00:58:17,145
- Take me home, will you Kid?
- Home, why?

598
00:58:17,558 --> 00:58:18,708
I'm tired.

599
00:58:19,714 --> 00:58:21,159
Let's get out of here.

600
00:58:23,482 --> 00:58:26,680
How about those two guys from Detroit?
We don't owe them.

601
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:34,395
Alright, that will be fine..

602
00:58:50,629 --> 00:58:53,554
What do you suppose
we want guys from out of town for?

603
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:57,890
They're gone.

604
00:58:58,495 --> 00:59:00,543
He's taken her home. Pop's house.

605
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:06,012
Now listen, make it fast.
Here is the address.

606
00:59:39,602 --> 00:59:41,742
Listen Kid, I know what I'm talking about.

607
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:43,204
What about Blackie?

608
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,751
Nan baby, you're seeing ghosts.

609
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:48,524
Things won't look so tough in the morning.

610
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:51,965
You're not going back to the party?

611
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:55,507
- No. Home.
- Promise?

612
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,110
Sure, the party is no fun without you.

613
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,559
Goodnight Nan.

614
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,264
No more nightmare, see?

615
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:12,988
Excuse me sir, there's
a man outside to see you.

616
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:16,177
- Who is it?
- I don't know sir.

617
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,692
Don't go Kid.

618
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:22,277
- Didn't he say what he wanted?
- No Sir.

619
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:23,733
Just that it was important.

620
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:28,968
Alright.

621
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:33,124
Do go out Kid, It's a plant, sure.

622
01:00:33,402 --> 01:00:34,734
That's what I want to find out.

623
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:35,955
Don't Kid, don't.

624
01:00:37,194 --> 01:00:38,173
Don't worry.

625
01:00:38,216 --> 01:00:39,286
I know what I'm doing.

626
01:00:39,463 --> 01:00:40,328
No Kid.

627
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,890
Kid, don't, don't be foolish.

628
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:44,707
- Kid please don't go.
- I'm alright. You stay here.

629
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:45,951
Here?

630
01:00:46,687 --> 01:00:48,906
Kid Kid, don't go.

631
01:00:49,573 --> 01:00:51,280
Kid, come back here.

632
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:07,045
- Looking for me?
- Who are you?

633
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,964
You ought to know
who I am, if it's so important.

634
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:12,916
Drop those.

635
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:23,264
Kick them out.

636
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:33,903
Now go home and tell your mommas
you've been born again tonight.

637
01:01:34,484 --> 01:01:35,463
Step on it.

638
01:01:58,223 --> 01:01:59,282
What I tell you?

639
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,138
I'll take you upstairs to your room.

640
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:11,091
We got to beat it
tonight, catch a train, go now.

641
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:13,710
No. You're going right to bed.

642
01:02:14,142 --> 01:02:15,121
Good night.

643
01:02:15,246 --> 01:02:16,418
Where you going?

644
01:02:17,272 --> 01:02:19,912
Back to have a little
session with the big fella.

645
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,495
Please Kid please don't go.

646
01:02:21,752 --> 01:02:23,675
If you love me, they'll get you sure.

647
01:02:24,337 --> 01:02:26,203
They're not getting me now nor anytime.

648
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:29,129
Kid please don't go.
Please, if you love me, don't go.

649
01:02:31,742 --> 01:02:32,721
I won't let you.

650
01:02:32,779 --> 01:02:35,374
- What you want me to do, crawl?
- This is no crawling.

651
01:02:35,408 --> 01:02:36,171
Listen Nan,

652
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:37,919
I've got to handle this my own way.

653
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:40,407
I'm having a showdown with
them tonight and that's flat.

654
01:02:40,436 --> 01:02:41,950
Oh, no Kid, no.

655
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:44,914
Kid please please don't go.

656
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:46,431
Please, if you love me.

657
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,386
Kid, don't...

658
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,387
Kid, come back.

659
01:03:01,464 --> 01:03:03,239
Come back, you fool.

660
01:03:16,674 --> 01:03:19,508
Fool.

661
01:04:32,538 --> 01:04:33,517
Hello...

662
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:35,200
Club Villa?

663
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:36,820
Mr Maskal please.

664
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,372
Tell him to hurry. It's very important.

665
01:04:59,732 --> 01:05:00,711
Big Fella?

666
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:02,392
It's Nan.

667
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,419
Well...

668
01:05:19,848 --> 01:05:22,897
Does that offer of yours still hold?

669
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:24,535
I'll say it does.

670
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:27,898
Tonight?

671
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:29,816
Great.

672
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,580
I'm leaving for home right now.

673
01:06:12,629 --> 01:06:16,122
I'll give you 5 minutes
to pack up and get out.

674
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,826
You think you're a fast worker, don't you?

675
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,610
Throw me out, grab the kid's girl,
knock him off. All before morning.

676
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,817
But, you're not giving this
baby the air. I'm not leaving.

677
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:29,162
No?

678
01:06:35,991 --> 01:06:37,755
Look who's here.

679
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:45,118
Hello, pal.

680
01:06:47,389 --> 01:06:50,154
- Where's the big fella?
- He's gone home.

681
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,551
- Why?
- Nothing.

682
01:06:54,328 --> 01:06:58,311
Where's Nan? Did she
fall without being pushed?

683
01:07:27,772 --> 01:07:30,958
- Listen big fella, have a heart.
- Oh, no, it's top stuff.

684
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,038
- Get out and step on it.
- In a hurry, ain't you?

685
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:36,650
What's the matter? You expecting company?

686
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:45,756
You know your way out.

687
01:08:38,044 --> 01:08:40,878
- Well hello Baby.
- Hello.

688
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:42,700
Is nice of you to come.

689
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:45,598
Oh, let me help you to take off your clothes.

690
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,074
Oh, heavy, isn't it?

691
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:53,993
What you carrying, gold?

692
01:08:55,282 --> 01:08:56,739
Haven't said.

693
01:09:00,363 --> 01:09:01,797
Now, is that nice?

694
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:04,397
I always carry it with me.

695
01:09:07,104 --> 01:09:08,481
You won't need it here.

696
01:10:12,579 --> 01:10:13,279
No.

697
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:16,621
Oh now, is that living up
to your side of the bargain?

698
01:10:16,769 --> 01:10:21,321
- I told you it was COD.
- Oh, Ok baby.

699
01:10:21,576 --> 01:10:23,226
Don't get so fussed about it.

700
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:28,200
I'll call McCoy now and tell him
to lay off, if that's all you want.

701
01:10:31,074 --> 01:10:34,124
I'll do more than that for you, Baby.

702
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:43,275
Hello? Club Villa?

703
01:10:44,477 --> 01:10:46,525
This is Maskal, get me McCoy.

704
01:10:47,131 --> 01:10:48,599
Only with Kid out of the mob.

705
01:10:48,757 --> 01:10:50,874
Run him out of the rackets, that's the deal.

706
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:53,117
When you come through, I will, not before.

707
01:10:53,267 --> 01:10:56,271
Alright baby, have it your own way.

708
01:10:56,814 --> 01:10:58,806
You'll see, I'll treat you square.

709
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:00,945
Oh darling.

710
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,159
I'm crazy about you.

711
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,247
And you'll see how happy I'll
make you, you can have everything.

712
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,354
Car, clothes, everything.

713
01:11:10,681 --> 01:11:13,310
- What about Agnes?
- OH, who cares about Agnes?

714
01:11:13,988 --> 01:11:14,967
Hello Mac...

715
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,893
Say Mac, forget it that about The Kid.

716
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:21,032
Yeah, I want you to lay off him.

717
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:23,841
Baby, you sure have me on the run.

718
01:11:23,998 --> 01:11:26,183
Yeah, you heard me, forget it.

719
01:11:26,896 --> 01:11:28,467
And don't you worry about Agnes.

720
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,579
I am through with her for good.

721
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:33,251
Yes, I want you to lay off him, yes.

722
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:36,595
But listen Chief, he just took a sock at me.

723
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:45,927
Hello hello...

724
01:11:50,157 --> 01:11:54,811
Let me in. Big Fella. Open the door.

725
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,728
Help. Help.

726
01:11:58,766 --> 01:12:00,792
A shot. I heard it and the door is locked.

727
01:12:02,122 --> 01:12:03,101
Open the door.

728
01:12:04,224 --> 01:12:05,897
Open the door or we'll kick it in.

729
01:12:16,745 --> 01:12:18,407
Come on boys, hurry up.

730
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:40,079
Big fella, speak to me.
Speak to me. Oh, he's dead.

731
01:12:41,476 --> 01:12:44,878
- You'll get plenty for this.
- I didn't do it, I tell you.

732
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,599
- I didn't do it.
- Then who did?

733
01:12:46,684 --> 01:12:48,880
- What's going on here?
- The big fella, look.

734
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:52,012
Kid Kid, they think I did it, but I didn't.

735
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:55,154
I just heard 2 shots and somebody
threw the gun in and locked the door.

736
01:12:55,186 --> 01:12:57,223
- That's true Kid, honest.
- Honest?

737
01:12:57,922 --> 01:13:00,801
- Why, you killed him, you...
- I didn't do that, swear I didn't.

738
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:01,855
Of course you didn't.

739
01:13:02,092 --> 01:13:03,071
Now, wait a minute.

740
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,600
- You believe me, don't you Kid?
- Sure, I believe you.

741
01:13:11,984 --> 01:13:14,533
But what was you doing
here? Why did you come?

742
01:13:16,965 --> 01:13:18,092
That's my business.

743
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:23,806
It wasn't because you thought you
could get me out of a tough spot, eh?

744
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,143
- No.
- Well, I know better.

745
01:13:27,296 --> 01:13:29,515
- Now, get out of here.
- Say...

746
01:13:30,332 --> 01:13:32,779
- Who's going? What right have you got to...
- Beat it.

747
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:34,264
Well, I like that.

748
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:35,391
Look here Kid.

749
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,075
- We ought to wait till McCoy gets here.
- I'm running this show.

750
01:13:39,306 --> 01:13:40,285
Good night.

751
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:50,552
Maybe Mac will have
something to say about this.

752
01:13:50,621 --> 01:13:51,725
Maybe he will.

753
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,000
I'll just stick around and see.

754
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:06,871
Well, what's the good of all this arguing?

755
01:14:07,023 --> 01:14:10,084
It's a cinch, sure.
If Nan didn't do it, who did?

756
01:14:10,234 --> 01:14:12,396
- Yeah, who?
- That's what I'd like to know.

757
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:13,472
How should I know?

758
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,583
Plenty of people would've
been glad to knock him off.

759
01:14:15,614 --> 01:14:16,593
Who, for instance?

760
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:20,377
- Agnes, for one.
- Me? How do you get that way?

761
01:14:20,459 --> 01:14:21,472
Why should I?

762
01:14:22,046 --> 01:14:24,663
The big fella told Nan
that he'd given you the air.

763
01:14:24,724 --> 01:14:27,592
Ah, that's just about of lucky as that
little rubbish that yarn of hers.

764
01:14:27,624 --> 01:14:29,513
Me and the boys think it was Nan.

765
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,334
We want to know who's
running this mob now, anyhow.

766
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,182
- I am.
- Who says so?

767
01:14:36,883 --> 01:14:38,533
I say so, for one.

768
01:14:42,762 --> 01:14:44,037
He's right boys.

769
01:14:44,858 --> 01:14:46,030
It's alright, the Kid.

770
01:14:46,088 --> 01:14:47,727
- Sure.
- That's right.

771
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:52,024
And when you talk to me take
that toothpick out of your mouth.

772
01:15:02,343 --> 01:15:03,993
Ah, you dumb egg.

773
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:06,086
Are you going to let him get
away with a thing like this?

774
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:09,026
If he's running this mob, what you're
going to do about the big fella?

775
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:10,664
He was knocked off, wasn't he?

776
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:14,422
Yeah, what do you going to do about it?

777
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,172
The payoff is up to you.

778
01:15:17,325 --> 01:15:19,476
- Sure.
- It's up to you Kid.

779
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,821
- Are you going to let her get away with it?
- Not much.

780
01:15:24,622 --> 01:15:25,658
Don't worry.

781
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:28,185
Whoever it is, will get what's coming to him.

782
01:15:28,216 --> 01:15:29,388
To her you mean.

783
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:32,573
If it wasn't her, what's that gun
doing here? It's hers.

784
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:35,236
She said it was. And the door locked.

785
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:36,945
- That's right Kid.
- Say...

786
01:15:37,222 --> 01:15:38,713
Are you trying to kid us?

787
01:15:38,864 --> 01:15:41,629
- Trying to give us the run-around.
- What's your idea?

788
01:15:41,778 --> 01:15:43,098
Well, what about it?

789
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:45,486
- Who said it was her gun?
- She did.

790
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:47,130
That's right, she said so herself.

791
01:15:47,163 --> 01:15:48,904
- The door...
- The door was locked.

792
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:51,454
- If she didn't do it, who did?
- He knows what he is doing.

793
01:15:51,484 --> 01:15:52,474
Don't be a sap.

794
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:55,835
Well, what do you going to do about it?

795
01:15:56,904 --> 01:15:57,883
Leave it to me.

796
01:15:58,539 --> 01:16:01,008
Don't bother, big fella.

797
01:16:01,685 --> 01:16:03,130
We'll handle this.

798
01:16:06,225 --> 01:16:08,387
We'll take him for a buggy-ride.

799
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:28,113
I'm running this show,
and I'm driving that buggy.

800
01:16:40,914 --> 01:16:45,658
Hello Nan? Listen, meet me outside
your house in 5 minutes, will you?

801
01:16:47,155 --> 01:16:48,487
No, I can't explain now.

802
01:16:49,377 --> 01:16:51,016
No, everything is alright.

803
01:16:54,897 --> 01:16:56,433
So far, so good.

804
01:16:56,841 --> 01:16:58,764
But be sure that you go through with it.

805
01:16:58,908 --> 01:17:00,490
I said I would, didn't I?

806
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:03,029
And don't try to pull any fast ones.

807
01:17:03,322 --> 01:17:05,757
Or we'll pay double. You get me?

808
01:17:07,516 --> 01:17:09,985
You wouldn't try to frighten me,
would you mister?

809
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:11,763
Wait a minute.

810
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:13,729
Don't be in such a hurry Chief.

811
01:17:14,192 --> 01:17:15,376
We're going your way.

812
01:17:24,718 --> 01:17:26,186
He thinks he can put one over.

813
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:27,752
We'll let the both of them have it.

814
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:28,752
Suits me.

815
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:51,091
- Kid?
- Yeah, Come on.

816
01:17:53,494 --> 01:17:56,111
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, nothing. Get in.

817
01:17:59,038 --> 01:18:02,702
- What for? Where we going?
- Get in, get in. It's alright.

818
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:27,969
What's the matter, Aggie?

819
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:29,524
Why are you in such a sweat?

820
01:18:29,554 --> 01:18:30,533
Me?

821
01:18:30,858 --> 01:18:31,837
I'm alright.

822
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,811
I thought you said the big fella
hadn't given you the air?

823
01:18:35,869 --> 01:18:36,848
Sure.

824
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:37,900
You heard me.

825
01:18:38,643 --> 01:18:40,111
Where were you going with this?

826
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:42,466
What you're hiding it
back of the curtain for?

827
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:47,573
Hey, what you trying to do?

828
01:19:47,604 --> 01:19:50,278
- Can't you see that train?
- Slow down. Are you crazy?

829
01:20:17,544 --> 01:20:18,523
Stop.

830
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:19,543
Pull up.

831
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:21,840
Slow down.

832
01:20:30,587 --> 01:20:31,782
Hey, what's the idea?

833
01:20:31,935 --> 01:20:33,904
Hey, are you crazy? Slow down.

834
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:35,791
Put on those brakes or I'll...

835
01:20:43,427 --> 01:20:46,795
- Well, why don't you go ahead and shoot?
- Go ahead, give it to him.

836
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,687
At this speed? Don't be a fool.

837
01:20:48,838 --> 01:20:51,512
- Feed it to her, That will stop him.
- Yeah.

838
01:20:51,997 --> 01:20:54,216
You put a slug in her
and you'll get the clip.

839
01:20:56,805 --> 01:20:58,376
That help you make up your mind.

840
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:00,598
Cover them.

841
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,509
Now shoot or tip your hardware overboard.

842
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:21,640
Thanks boys. We're slowing up here.

843
01:21:33,617 --> 01:21:34,596
This way out.

844
01:21:42,171 --> 01:21:44,447
Maybe the walk back home
will clear your heads.

845
01:21:44,773 --> 01:21:48,699
And you can figure out for yourselves,
that it was Agnes that got the big fella.

846
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:50,392
And get out.

847
01:21:51,831 --> 01:21:54,767
And you can kiss a beer barrel
goodbye for me, forever.

848
01:21:55,358 --> 01:21:56,621
Oh?

849
01:22:03,767 --> 01:22:04,746
Hey...

850
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,257
No hard feelings.
