1
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,937
Come in.

2
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:16,839
What is it, Poole?

3
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:18,884
It's a quarter to three, sir.

4
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,804
And your address at the university
is at 3:00.

5
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,054
So it is, Poole.

6
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,015
So it is.

7
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:30,019
You know, Poole, you're a nuisance.

8
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:30,978
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,147
But I don't know
what I should do without you.

10
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,440
Thank you, sir.

11
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:38,486
Your sense of duty
is as impregnable as Gibraltar.

12
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,405
Even Bach can't move it.

13
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:42,448
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

14
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:44,492
I'm afraid you'll be late, sir.

15
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:46,661
I see you want to get rid of me.

16
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:51,124
All right, Poole. All right.

17
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,633
Those are lovely roses, Poole.

18
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:03,509
Thank you, sir.

19
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,483
Will you wear your overcoat or cape, sir?

20
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:18,816
Give me my cape.

21
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:02,903
Good afternoon, Jasper.

22
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:04,320
Good afternoon, sir.

23
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,239
- Nice day, isn't it?
- Isn't it, sir?

24
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:10,242
- St. Simons.
- Yes, sir.

25
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:24,965
- How do you do, sir?
- Constable.

26
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,053
- How are you, Stubbs?
- Very good, thank you, sir.

27
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,351
I won't need you anymore today, Jasper.

28
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,561
Dr. Lanyon will take me
where I'm going later.

29
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,645
Yes, sir.

30
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,528
- How do you do, Dr. Jekyll?
- How do you do?

31
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,700
- Hello, Hampton.
- Afternoon, sir.

32
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,746
The auditorium is full, sir.
Always is when you speak, sir.

33
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:58,455
Flattery!

34
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,813
- I hope Jekyll's in form today.
- He's always in form.

35
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,107
The old codgers are in for another jolt.

36
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,527
I'd wager your friend has something
up his sleeve again, Dr. Lanyon.

37
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:30,280
Jekyll is always sensational.

38
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,698
Always indulging in spectacular theories.

39
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:36,743
Gentlemen... London is so full of fog...

40
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,913
that it has penetrated our minds,

41
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,749
set boundaries for our vision.

42
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:46,211
As men of science, we should be curious,

43
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,714
and bold enough to peer beyond it,

44
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,383
into the many wonders it conceals.

45
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:54,845
I shall not dwell today
on the secrets of the human body

46
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,763
in sickness and in health.

47
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:59,766
Today, I want to talk to you
of a greater marvel.

48
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,602
The soul of man.

49
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,147
My analysis of this soul,

50
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:07,523
the human psyche,

51
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,319
leads me to believe that
man is not truly one,

52
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,863
but truly two.

53
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:18,743
One of him
strives for the nobilities of life.

54
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,745
This, we call his good self.

55
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:25,207
The other, seeks an expression of impulses

56
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,878
that bind him to
some dim animal relation with the earth.

57
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:32,048
This, we may call the bad.

58
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:37,053
These two carry out an eternal struggle
in the nature of man,

59
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,096
yet they are chained together.

60
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,558
And that chain
spells repression to the evil,

61
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,268
remorse to the good.

62
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:49,190
Now, if these two selves
could be separated from each other,

63
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:52,068
how much freer the good in us would be.

64
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,570
What heights it might scale.

65
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,197
And the so-called evil,

66
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:01,661
once liberated, would fulfill itself
and trouble us no more.

67
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,290
I believe the day is not far off,
when this separation will be possible.

68
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:10,543
In my experiments, I have found that

69
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:13,630
certain chemicals have the power and the...

70
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:19,761
Tell me, he can split me in two
like a jolly amoeba.

71
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,429
By Jove, it's marvelous.

72
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,210
I confess, it's too much for me.

73
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:25,863
Why don't you stay at home
and send your other self to the lecture?

74
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:28,978
To divide a human being in two?
Ridiculous!

75
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:31,356
I'm going to try to analyze my psyche.

76
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,441
I didn't expect you to
agree with me, Lanyon.

77
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:35,192
Agree with you? You talk like a lunatic.

78
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,811
However I hope you're sane enough
to remember that

79
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:40,365
we're expected for a consultation
at the Duchess of Densmore's.

80
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:41,448
- I'm not going.
- What?

81
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:44,993
Please give the duchess my compliments
and some castor oil.

82
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:45,911
Now Jekyll.

83
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:47,747
I saw her yesterday.
She's a bit bilious.

84
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,623
More in spirit than in body, I'm afraid.

85
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,365
I'm going along to the free wards.

86
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,793
My dear fellow, be reasonable.

87
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,247
You know how insistent the duchess was
on your coming.

88
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:56,380
Heaven knows why.

89
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:58,590
You can't neglect her
for a lot of charity cases.

90
00:07:58,674 --> 00:07:59,758
Can't I, though, Lanyon?

91
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:02,386
It's the things one can't do
that always tempt me.

92
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:03,972
Oh, well, just as you like.

93
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:05,671
But you will remember
we have a dinner engagement

94
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,515
at the Carews' tonight.

95
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:07,756
- Yes, indeed.
- I'll pick you up later.

96
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,646
Thanks, old fellow.
You'll find me in the wards.

97
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:10,894
See you anon.

98
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,858
Mary, what are you doing
with those crutches?

99
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,944
I can't do without them, sir.

100
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:21,070
Yes, you can do without them, Mary.

101
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:22,823
I told you yesterday.

102
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,075
Believe me, I can do anything for you.

103
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,871
I believe you, sir,

104
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,915
but I can't walk without them, sir.

105
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,041
Yes, you can. Give them to me.

106
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:35,794
Don't be afraid.

107
00:08:37,837 --> 00:08:40,506
Now walk, Mary. Come on. Come to me.

108
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,674
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,180
Walk, Mary. Come on.

110
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,933
All right, sir.

111
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:54,729
- I can walk, sir.
- Of course you can.

112
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:56,606
I can walk, sir!

113
00:08:56,898 --> 00:09:00,943
Oh! Oh! I can walk, sir!

114
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:02,820
I can walk, sir.

115
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:12,871
There, there, Mrs. Lucas.

116
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,502
- It hurts, doesn't it?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:20,963
Sometimes a doctor must
hurt you a little to make you well.

118
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:22,048
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:25,051
And if a doctor thinks
a slight operation is necessary,

120
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:26,541
there's no need to be afraid, is there?

121
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,427
No, sir.

122
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,429
I want you to know it's going to cure you.

123
00:09:29,513 --> 00:09:31,432
I believe you, sir.

124
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,769
Jekyll, we haven't much time, you know?

125
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:37,229
I'm sorry, Lanyon.
I'm afraid I must miss the dinner.

126
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:38,792
I'll come afterwards for the dancing.

127
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:39,898
Why, what's keeping you?

128
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:41,734
I must operate on this patient at once.

129
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,985
Well, why not leave it to
one of the house surgeons?

130
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:45,695
They're quite competent.

131
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,489
Perhaps, but I prefer to do it myself.

132
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:51,909
Will you make my excuses
to General Carew and Muriel, please?

133
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,369
As you like.

134
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,248
Oh, Lanyon.
You make my excuses to the General,

135
00:09:56,706 --> 00:09:58,666
and I'll make mine to Muriel myself.

136
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,043
Oh, well, all right.

137
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,336
Yes, Miss Muriel?

138
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,213
Will it be almond cakes
with coffee, Hobson?

139
00:10:03,296 --> 00:10:04,922
I'm sorry, miss, but I don't think so.

140
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:06,842
Oh, but we must have almond cakes.

141
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,874
- Send for them immediately.
- Very good, miss.

142
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:11,179
What's this?
What's this about almond cakes?

143
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,972
Dr. Jekyll likes them, Father.

144
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:15,224
You know,
you'll spoil that fiance of yours.

145
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:17,602
- I like spoiling him.
- Mm, so I observe.

146
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,311
And what about your father?

147
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,715
Well, you're already
the most spoiled darling in the world.

148
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:22,815
Dr. Lanyon.

149
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:25,359
Ah, Lanyon, delighted to see you.

150
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,653
Punctual for dinner,
punctual in everything, eh?

151
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:30,030
- How do you do, sir?
- What an astonishing motto, Father.

152
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:31,754
- How do you do, Muriel?
- Where's Jekyll?

153
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,409
He stayed to perform an operation.

154
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:35,526
- Oh, isn't he coming?
- He will be in after dinner.

155
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,204
He asked me to make his excuses.

156
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,915
I hope the patient is
worthy of Jekyll's attention.

157
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,792
A woman in the free wards.

158
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,501
Free ward?

159
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:46,547
Jekyll gives entirely too much time
to his charity patients.

160
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,216
- Oh, I love him for that.
- Nonsense, my dear.

161
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,884
He ought to come down to earth.

162
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,678
- Mr. Utterson.
- Ah, Utterson.

163
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,056
However, I've promised Harry
the first waltz.

164
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,643
If he's late, I shall be furious.

165
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,352
Oh, no.

166
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,828
You know, I'm very glad Jekyll is late.

167
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,415
I'm obliged to him
for a most delightful waltz.

168
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,716
Thank you.

169
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:37,472
Hello, General.
I'm very sorry to be late, sir. Muriel.

170
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,808
Well, repentance is a virtue, Jekyll,
but it's better to be punctual.

171
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,727
In 40 years,
I've never been late for dinner.

172
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,219
It's indeed a remarkable record, sir.

173
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:47,397
Oh, merely a matter of training, my boy.

174
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:48,650
- At the age of...
- General?

175
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,153
You've not forgotten this is our dance?

176
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,904
Oh, certainly not, Lady Dakin.

177
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,490
I've been looking forward to it.
Uh, see you later, Jekyll.

178
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,742
- May I?
- I shouldn't.

179
00:11:58,825 --> 00:11:59,825
But you will.

180
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:06,166
- Was she pretty?
- Ravishing.

181
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,168
- Who?
- Your patient.

182
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,045
Oh, I was thinking of someone else.

183
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:11,837
Someone to make you late again?

184
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,132
- Are you chiding me?
- Of course.

185
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,802
- Because you hate me?
- Of course, silly.

186
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,722
Well, then, will you come
into the garden where I can bear it?

187
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,557
- Certainly not.
- Why not?

188
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,892
Father. He'd be furious.

189
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:26,436
It will do him good.

190
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,437
Well, he's not looking.

191
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:30,315
He's teaching Lady Dakin how to waltz.

192
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,784
- We shan't stay long.
- Just forever.

193
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,952
Oh, no. Not even half as long as that.

194
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:55,756
Now, my farthing, chide me,
mock me, hate me,

195
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,466
but don't send me away.

196
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,719
Silly. Are you sorry you were late?

197
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,805
- Oh, no.
- You're not?

198
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,630
If I hadn't been late,
you wouldn't have pouted.

199
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,516
I shall never forgive...

200
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:06,716
If you hadn't pouted,
you wouldn't have looked

201
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:07,726
so divinely pretty.

202
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,719
Do you talk this way to your patients?

203
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,329
If you hadn't looked so divinely pretty,
I might have postponed...

204
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:15,067
- Pardon?
- Not another word.

205
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,652
Well?

206
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,822
I might have postponed telling you
that I love you so much

207
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,825
that I don't want to wait any longer.

208
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:24,701
I want you to marry me now.

209
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,454
Oh, darling, I want to with all my heart.

210
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:30,749
You know I do, but father's so difficult.

211
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,668
I don't wanna marry your father.

212
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,118
I don't mind having
a difficult father-in-law.

213
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,380
You'd be worth it, my darling.

214
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,007
I don't think you love me seriously.

215
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,717
Oh, I love you better than that.

216
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,595
I love you gaily, happily, high-heartedly.

217
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,431
I love you so much
that I could laugh and sing and...

218
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,851
Oh, no, I shouldn't spoil it
by trying to sing.

219
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,603
Oh, my darling,

220
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,815
I shall persuade your father
to let us marry now.

221
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,523
I can't wait any longer.

222
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,901
We shall go to Devon for our honeymoon,

223
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:01,362
and live on love and strawberries,
and the sight of the sea.

224
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:03,530
- And moonlight.
- Endless moonlight.

225
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,535
Oh, I do love you seriously.

226
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:12,082
So seriously that it frightens me.

227
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:17,669
You've opened a gate for me
into another world.

228
00:14:18,713 --> 00:14:21,800
Before that, my work was everything.

229
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:24,928
I was drawn to the mysteries of science,
to the unknown.

230
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:29,098
But now, the unknown wears your face.

231
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:34,186
Looks back at me with your eyes.

232
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:39,358
Darling, I wish
this moment would last forever.

233
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,443
You can make it last, dear.

234
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,071
Oh, I love you.

235
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,323
Be near me always.

236
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:52,120
- Always? You and I?
- Apart from the world.

237
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:56,082
I love you, darling. I love you.

238
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,252
Then who shall ever separate us?

239
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:05,466
- My sweet friend.
- Oh, my love. My love.

240
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:38,457
You ought to wear squeaky shoes, Hobson.

241
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,750
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

242
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,573
The General asks you to
come into the house, Miss Muriel.

243
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:44,379
Your guests are enquiring about you.

244
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:45,713
Coming, Hobson.

245
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:30,790
- Charming evening, sir.
- Glad you came, Bonner.

246
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,917
- Good night, Muriel.
- Good night.

247
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,334
You looked perfectly lovely tonight, dear.

248
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,179
Thank you.

249
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,638
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye.

250
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:36,764
Good night, General.

251
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:39,058
I don't know when
I've enjoyed myself so much.

252
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:40,017
I'm glad.

253
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,603
I'll see you at tea tomorrow, dear.

254
00:16:41,686 --> 00:16:44,146
Yes. I won't forget, Lady Dakin.
Good night.

255
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,522
- Good night.
- Good night.

256
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,068
Ah, Jekyll, my boy. Waiting to see me?

257
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:49,193
I beg your pardon, sir,

258
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,768
but you would make Muriel and me very happy

259
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,538
if you'd set an earlier date
for our wedding.

260
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,949
I've already announced to you

261
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,868
that you would be married
on the anniversary of my own wedding.

262
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,312
That's eight months from now, sir.

263
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:00,621
Well, what of it?

264
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:02,424
We've already been engaged two months, sir.

265
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,916
We see no reason to...

266
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,418
I presume I have some rights in the matter.

267
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,302
Quite right, sir.
That's why we're asking you.

268
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:09,880
Well, why this impatience?

269
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:12,716
Hang it all, man. It isn't done.
It isn't done.

270
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,802
I'm sorry, sir, but I cannot regard that
as a serious objection.

271
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:17,513
Do you hear this, Lanyon?

272
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,808
Is this another evidence
of your eccentricity?

273
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,894
If it is eccentric
to be impatient in love, sir, I am.

274
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,396
This is positively indecent.

275
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,940
Father, do you think it's fair
to keep us apart for so long?

276
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,567
I waited five years for your mother.

277
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,211
You have a sturdy temperament, General.

278
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,655
Yes, yes, I pride myself on it.

279
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,824
Please don't make me wait that long
for Muriel.

280
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:40,118
Now, my boy,
you must leave these matters to me.

281
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,787
There's such a thing as
decent observance, you know?

282
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:45,623
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

283
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,976
- Good night, Lanyon.
- Good night, sir.

284
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,585
Au revoir, my sweet.

285
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,505
Come, Lanyon.

286
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,990
- Good night, Muriel.
- Good night.

287
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,308
Well, I'm afraid you offended the General.

288
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:05,476
Offended him?

289
00:18:06,227 --> 00:18:08,395
It's a pity I didn't strangle
the old walrus.

290
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:11,440
Did you hear him? "Wait. Wait."

291
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,525
What the devil does one wait for?

292
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:18,155
Well, I hope
the responsibilities of marriage

293
00:18:18,238 --> 00:18:19,282
will sober you up.

294
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:21,734
I'm not marrying to be sober.
I'm marrying to be drunk.

295
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,202
Drunk with love and life and experiments.

296
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,080
Your experiments are absurd,
my dear fellow.

297
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:27,998
Ha! You have no interest
in science at all.

298
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,292
You have no dreams, no curiosity.

299
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,877
There are bounds
beyond which one should not go.

300
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:34,463
Yes. It isn't done, I suppose.

301
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,548
I tell you, there are no bounds, Lanyon.

302
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:38,300
Look at that gas lamp.

303
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,542
But for some man's curiosity,
we should not have had it.

304
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,512
London would still be lighted by linkboys.

305
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:46,098
And wait. One day,
London will glow with incandescence,

306
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:49,226
and will be so beautiful
that even you will be moved by it.

307
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,855
Well, I find London
quite satisfactory as it is,

308
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,608
and I'm not interested in your shortcuts
and your byways.

309
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,694
But it's in the byways
that the secrets and wonders lie.

310
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:00,321
In science and in life. Look at the...

311
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,032
Let go, or I'll bash you in the jaw.

312
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:05,035
Go on, you big brute.
Hit me. Hit me.

313
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,577
I'll put the police on you.

314
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,330
You'll put the police on me?

315
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,836
Are you badly hurt?

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,796
Oh, you poor girl.

317
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,912
Where does this girl live?

318
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:20,549
Upstairs, first door to the left
at the top of the stairs.

319
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,510
Bring her up here.

320
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,471
Oh, sweetheart.

321
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:28,598
Make way for the governor.
Have you got her, governor?

322
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,893
- Right up here?
- Yes. Look out for her head.

323
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:34,938
Oh, shut up, you lot!

324
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:40,486
What was this all about?

325
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:42,028
Ivy Pearson, sir.

326
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:43,938
- One of Ivy Pearson's callers...
- I can tell you...

327
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,907
Now, shut up! One of Ivy...

328
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:50,329
That swine. Hit me, will he?

329
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:53,499
He'll wish he hadn't!
He'll wish he hadn't!

330
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:56,709
I ain't afraid of him, I ain't.
Blast his dirty mug!

331
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,045
He's killed me, that's what he's done.

332
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,548
He's broken me jaw and me knee, too.

333
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,174
I'll get him for this.

334
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:09,639
Look where he kicked me.

335
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,226
It's only a bruise.

336
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,218
It will be quite well in a few days.

337
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:17,788
By the way, you mustn't wear
so tight a garter. It's bad for you.

338
00:20:20,482 --> 00:20:22,485
It impedes the circulation.

339
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:28,157
It's awful kind of you to look after me.

340
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,786
Anybody can see now
that you're a real gent, you are.

341
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:35,498
Now you're the kind
a woman would do something for.

342
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,416
You'll be all right.

343
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,586
Good night.

344
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,254
- What is it?
- He's hit me here, too, the blighter.

345
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,506
He's broken me ribs, that's what he's done.

346
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,217
I'm going to faint.

347
00:20:49,052 --> 00:20:50,471
You're not seriously hurt.

348
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,483
A bit of rest would do you no harm, though.

349
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,101
You think I ought to go to bed?

350
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,271
I know of no better place for a rest.

351
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:01,273
Oh. All right.

352
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:03,525
You turn your eyes away now.

353
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,672
How is the pain now?

354
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:13,968
I say!

355
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:16,555
Oh. Lanyon.

356
00:22:17,431 --> 00:22:19,349
Coming.

357
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:24,688
I'm a doctor, you know,
and I'll call that kiss my fee.

358
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:30,026
Well?

359
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,574
Come back soon, won't you?

360
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:37,116
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't.

361
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,660
Oh, yes, you can.

362
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:39,953
Soon.

363
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,789
- Good night.
- Come back.

364
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:54,258
Come back soon, won't you?

365
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:57,011
Oh, yes, you can.

366
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:58,845
Soon.

367
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,599
Come back.

368
00:23:03,392 --> 00:23:05,561
I thought your conduct
quite disgusting, Jekyll.

369
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,479
Conduct? Why, a pretty girl kissed me.

370
00:23:07,771 --> 00:23:09,171
Should I have called the constable?

371
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,025
- Even suppose I'd liked it.
- What?

372
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,109
Yes.

373
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:14,393
That's not a matter of conduct,
but of elementary instinct.

374
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:15,883
You ought to control those instincts.

375
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:18,991
Are you pretending that
you either can or do?

376
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,827
We may control our actions,
but not our impulses.

377
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:24,288
Perhaps you've forgotten
you're engaged to Muriel.

378
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,247
Forgotten it?

379
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,043
Can a man dying of thirst forget water?

380
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:34,509
And do you know what would happen
to that thirst if it were denied water?

381
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,843
If I understand you correctly,
you sound almost indecent.

382
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:40,596
What names you give things.

383
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:42,735
Well, why aren't you frank enough to admit

384
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:44,600
that other indecent self in you?

385
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:47,185
No. You prefer to hide it,
pretend it isn't there.

386
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,908
- You have to accept certain things.
- I don't want to accept them.

387
00:23:50,063 --> 00:23:51,815
I want to be clean, not only in my conduct,

388
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,539
but in my innermost thoughts and desires.

389
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,194
- There's only one way to do it.
- How?

390
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:58,655
Separate the two natures in us.

391
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:00,531
Oh, that absurd theory of yours.

392
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:02,158
I tell you, it's unscientific

393
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,881
not to admit the possibility of anything.

394
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,788
- Oh, you're mad.
- Mad, eh, Lanyon?

395
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:08,914
Oh, we'll see.

396
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,375
We'll see.

397
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,790
Come in.

398
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:01,881
What is it, Poole?

399
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,812
Begging your pardon for the intrusion, sir,

400
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,762
but did you sleep last night, sir?

401
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:07,388
Don't worry about me.

402
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:10,683
Yes, sir, but you had only a cup of tea
for breakfast for three days.

403
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:11,766
Your health.

404
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,738
Now, Poole, you didn't come here
to enquire after my health, did you?

405
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,356
One of General Carew's servants
brought this, sir.

406
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:29,817
Miss Muriel is scolding me
for having missed a dinner last night.

407
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:30,661
Yes, sir.

408
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:31,777
Go to her at once and tell her that

409
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,320
I shall certainly come to dinner
tomorrow night.

410
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,330
Very good, sir.

411
00:28:15,573 --> 00:28:16,615
Marry me now.

412
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:19,075
I can't wait any longer.

413
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:20,703
Positively indecent.

414
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:22,163
Look where he kicked me.

415
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,748
Your conduct was disgusting.

416
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:26,625
It isn't done. It isn't done.

417
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,085
Pity I didn't strangle him.

418
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:30,128
Strangle him.

419
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,839
Indecent. Indecent.

420
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:35,550
Can a man dying of thirst forget water?

421
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:36,634
Disgusting.

422
00:28:37,177 --> 00:28:38,179
You're mad. Mad.

423
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:40,055
Come back soon, won't you?

424
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,599
Come back.

425
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:44,391
Come back.

426
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:46,727
Come back.

427
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:49,272
Come back.

428
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,578
Free!

429
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,625
Free at last!

430
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:58,882
Mad eh, Lanyon? Eh, Carew?

431
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:02,302
You hypocrites.
Deniers of life.

432
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:07,223
If you could see me now,
what would you think, hm?

433
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,636
Who is there? Who is there?

434
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,219
Who's there?

435
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,395
Dr. Jekyll?

436
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,147
Dr. Jekyll, sir?

437
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,357
Is that you?

438
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:02,277
Do you hear me, sir?

439
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,199
Please let me in, sir. Let me in!

440
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,753
I beg your pardon, sir.

441
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,255
I thought I heard a strange voice.

442
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,039
That's quite all right, Poole.
There was someone here.

443
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,049
A friend of mine.

444
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,302
His name is Hyde. Mr. Hyde.

445
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:30,128
He's just gone out the back door.

446
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,138
Yeah.

447
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,086
Marry me now, my darling.

448
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:04,505
You don't know how much I need you.

449
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:08,634
I want to with all my heart, but Father...

450
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:10,197
I'll speak to him. I'll convince him.

451
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,303
No, no. Let me talk to him.

452
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:14,347
I'll try to change his mind
while we're away.

453
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,808
- Away?
- Yes.

454
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,204
Oh, darling, I've dreaded telling you,

455
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,812
but Father's taking me to Bath tomorrow.

456
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,398
He has no right to take you away from me.

457
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,359
Why must we put up with this?

458
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
You want to marry me?

459
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:29,946
With all my heart.

460
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:31,309
We'll marry without his consent.

461
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:32,700
Say you will, my darling.

462
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,242
We'll go to Paris for our honeymoon.

463
00:32:34,784 --> 00:32:36,452
We'll be so gloriously happy

464
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:38,830
that even the French will be jealous of us.

465
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,874
I'm so thrilled and tempted,

466
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:43,116
but I don't want to hurt my father.

467
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:44,646
It's only a little hurt to his vanity.

468
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:47,881
You'll do me a greater hurt if you refuse.

469
00:32:48,006 --> 00:32:49,966
Do be patient just a little while.

470
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:52,894
I'm sure I can persuade him
while we're gone.

471
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:55,722
- But, Muriel...
- Darling, don't you love me enough...

472
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:57,639
to wait a little while?

473
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:00,308
Of course.

474
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:03,044
Of course, I love you enough, dear.

475
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:06,523
I'll wait.

476
00:33:09,902 --> 00:33:10,904
I'll wait.

477
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:18,286
Wait.

478
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,414
Wait.

479
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,679
Come in.

480
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:46,688
A letter from Bath, sir.

481
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:00,962
Miss Muriel won't be home
for another month.

482
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:05,581
- Can't even go to see her.
- I'm sorry to hear it, sir.

483
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,667
Another month.

484
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,043
I beg your pardon, sir,

485
00:34:09,126 --> 00:34:12,338
but may I suggest that
you ought to amuse yourself.

486
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,800
Amuse myself?
Now, what do you suggest, Poole?

487
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,426
Well, you ought to go out, sir.

488
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,347
London offers many amusements
for a gentleman like you, sir.

489
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:24,487
Yes, but a gentleman like me
daren't take advantage of them, Poole.

490
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:27,728
Gentlemen like me have to be
very careful of what they do and say.

491
00:34:28,771 --> 00:34:30,356
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:03,772
Here! Here!

493
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:05,816
What are you after down there?

494
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:10,529
Ah! I was calling on the young lady
who occupies the little nest.

495
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:12,239
- If it's Ivy Pearson you mean...
- Yeah.

496
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,908
She ain't in.

497
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,744
Do you know where I can find her?

498
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:20,748
If I was wanting her,
I'd try the Variety Music Hall.

499
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,625
Oh! Thank you.

500
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,335
I thank you.

501
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,420
You get out! What do you take me for?

502
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,757
Get out!

503
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:53,489
- Stay out of here.
- I didn't do nothing, mister.

504
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,941
A bottle of champagne
and be quick about it.

505
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:33,069
What are you staring at?

506
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:34,485
Nothing, sir.

507
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:18,059
Well, what are you waiting for?

508
00:40:18,946 --> 00:40:20,949
A tip, eh? Get out!

509
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:23,283
Blighter.

510
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:30,917
- Sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
- You swine!

511
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:34,838
He's a rum'un.

512
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:41,718
Let's have a drink.

513
00:41:01,113 --> 00:41:04,158
Champagne Ivy is my name

514
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:06,952
Champagne Ivy is my name

515
00:41:07,036 --> 00:41:10,414
Good for any game at night, my boy

516
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:13,292
You come and join me in a spree

517
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,376
I will.

518
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:19,673
You're a bit of something to look at
and listen to, dearie.

519
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,800
Not half bad, so they say.

520
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,052
You ain't conceited, are you?

521
00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:25,679
Well, I has me points.

522
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:28,306
Hey, Charlie!

523
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,684
Blimey, there's Irv.
I'll be back in half a mo.

524
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:32,852
Hey. Hey, you. Hey.

525
00:41:36,272 --> 00:41:39,317
Tell that wench in black to come over
and have a bottle of wine with me.

526
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:40,651
- Yes, sir.
- That's right.

527
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:48,660
The gent in the box
wants you to have wine with him.

528
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:49,911
Oh, he does, does he?

529
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:51,371
What of it?

530
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:53,154
Well, you'd better come
if you know what's good for you.

531
00:41:53,164 --> 00:41:55,041
He ain't one to be trifled with, he ain't.

532
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,501
Strike me pink. You interest me.

533
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,003
I'll take a chance.

534
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:04,007
- Where is he?
- I'll take you to him.

535
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,064
This is indeed a great honor.
I noticed you as you came in, my dear.

536
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:20,858
"There," I said to myself,

537
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:23,694
"is too pretty a girl
to waste on such a companion."

538
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:26,655
Ah, but you are pretty.

539
00:42:27,072 --> 00:42:29,700
And what a figure, my dear.

540
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:31,618
What a figure.

541
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,787
A glass of champagne.

542
00:42:34,496 --> 00:42:36,497
To you. To you, my dear.

543
00:42:37,082 --> 00:42:38,751
To your beauty, mm?

544
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,801
- I must be going now.
- Going?

545
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,927
- Where?
- Uh, home.

546
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:51,346
You call that home?

547
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,224
That pigsty of yours in Baffin's Court?

548
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:55,767
Sty, is it? You come off that.

549
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,437
Oh, I like you
when your temper's up, my dear.

550
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:00,396
How do you know where I live?

551
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:03,691
I saw you on the street and followed you.

552
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:06,194
Ah, my pretty,
you deserve better than that.

553
00:43:06,444 --> 00:43:08,237
You ought to live in a place worthy of you.

554
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:12,575
Buckingham Palace, I suppose.

555
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:14,202
That's the spirit I like.

556
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:16,662
Sit down, my dear.
Sit down just for a moment, eh?

557
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:20,416
You should have a place that would
set off that fine body of yours,

558
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,211
yellow hair and pale face.

559
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:26,506
Clothes to match, too, my dear.
Silk, eh?

560
00:43:26,798 --> 00:43:29,300
And a bracelet or two, eh?

561
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:31,593
Champagne to drink, eh?

562
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,095
How would you like that?

563
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:35,138
And how am I to get it?

564
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:41,019
How do you think you're going to get it,
my bright little bird, hm?

565
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:47,734
I am no gentleman, no, but I have money.

566
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,321
Perhaps my looks don't please you.

567
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:53,031
Well, you ain't no beauty.

568
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:55,534
Quite right. I am no beauty.

569
00:43:56,535 --> 00:43:58,537
Perhaps you prefer a gentleman, eh?

570
00:43:58,954 --> 00:44:02,791
One of those fine-mannered, virtuous,
and honorable gentlemen.

571
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,669
One of those canting hypocrites

572
00:44:05,752 --> 00:44:08,797
who like your legs,
but talk about your garter.

573
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,381
What are you talking about?

574
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,009
Oh, my poor little innocent.

575
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:16,263
It doesn't know what I'm talking about, eh?

576
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:19,890
Well, well, well,
it's afraid of me, isn't it?

577
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:22,352
No! I ain't afraid of you.

578
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,395
- Aren't you? Good.
- Hey, you.

579
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:27,352
Trying to steal my girl, are you,
you dirty blighter?

580
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,640
Come back, you.
I'll fix you for this, you wench.

581
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,942
Sit down! Sit down.

582
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,058
I'll knock your blooming head off!

583
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,112
Get out of here, you...

584
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:43,664
You couldn't have done it.

585
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,166
Couldn't I, though? Why not?

586
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,836
This place was just made for it.

587
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:51,272
- Oh, now.
- Here, stop that. Let me go.

588
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:54,717
- Oh, no. You're not going anywhere.
- Let me go. I'm going.

589
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,177
I'm going home!

590
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,970
Sit down.

591
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,932
Forgive me, my dear.

592
00:45:02,807 --> 00:45:04,935
You see, I hurt you because I love you.

593
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:06,936
I want you.

594
00:45:08,063 --> 00:45:11,275
And what I want, I get.

595
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:13,902
I grant you, I am no beauty,

596
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:16,613
but under this exterior...

597
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:21,702
you'll find a very flower of man.

598
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:23,285
Look at me.

599
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,831
Do you suppose
I'd let anybody stand in my way?

600
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:31,794
I love you. I love you.
Do you understand?

601
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:34,589
You'll come with me, eh?

602
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,761
You'll come with me.

603
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:53,149
Come in, sir.

604
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,070
I presume your master is out.

605
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:58,946
Yes, sir. So he is, sir.

606
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:00,365
He's always out when I call.

607
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,568
Tell your master
I've had a letter from General Carew.

608
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:06,161
He tells me that
Dr. Jekyll has not replied to

609
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:07,404
any of Miss Muriel's letters.

610
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:09,706
- She's worried about him.
- I'll tell him, sir.

611
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,947
Anyway, I'm relieved to know
he's not confined to his bed.

612
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,461
Begging your pardon, sir.

613
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:17,048
It's my opinion that my master isn't well.

614
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,216
He hardly sees his patients, sir.

615
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:22,219
I haven't seen him myself
for days at a time.

616
00:46:22,302 --> 00:46:25,597
He often comes and goes
by the back door of the laboratory, sir.

617
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:28,600
I must be going, Poole.
Good day.

618
00:46:38,026 --> 00:46:39,026
Who's there?

619
00:46:39,194 --> 00:46:40,987
It's me, dearie, your landlady.

620
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,322
Come in, Mrs. Hawkins.

621
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,450
Oh, how are you, dearie?

622
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,287
You don't have to answer.

623
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:52,124
I can see for myself
you ain't as fit as you ought to be,

624
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:53,290
and no wonder.

625
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,044
Oh, here, dearie.
I brought you the newspaper.

626
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:57,919
Thank you, Mrs. Hawkins.

627
00:46:58,254 --> 00:46:59,922
Oh, you're having a cup of tea, I see.

628
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,718
If you don't mind, dearie,
I'll sit with you a minute.

629
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,427
I'm that done in.

630
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:07,972
Oh, will you have
a cup of tea, Mrs. Hawkins?

631
00:47:08,055 --> 00:47:10,433
Thank you, dearie. I don't mind if I do.

632
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:13,310
After all, a neighbor's a neighbor, says I.

633
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:15,979
Here's a bit of a surprise for you.

634
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:19,357
He's a lodger of mine,
and a very likely lad he is, too.

635
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:20,568
His name's Arvis,

636
00:47:20,901 --> 00:47:22,111
and he says to me, says he,

637
00:47:22,444 --> 00:47:25,114
"Who's the pretty lass what has the parlor?

638
00:47:25,197 --> 00:47:28,659
I wonder if she'd be inclined to
drop in at the music hall with me

639
00:47:28,743 --> 00:47:30,160
one of these fine nights?

640
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:32,078
You ask her," says he.

641
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:33,538
Now, my advice, dearie...

642
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,572
No, no, no.
I don't want to hear any more about it.

643
00:47:35,582 --> 00:47:39,002
Oh. Afraid of
what Hyde will do to you, ain't you?

644
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:40,128
No, I ain't afraid.

645
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:44,967
If that blighter was my man,
he wouldn't dare to lay a hand on me.

646
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:47,385
Not if he knowed what was good for him.

647
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,554
He's a brute. That's what he is.

648
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:51,432
And my advice, dearie...

649
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:11,283
- What do you want?
- I've come for the rent, sir.

650
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:13,328
You'll get it when it's due.

651
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:14,787
Very good, sir.

652
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:24,338
What did that filthy harridan want?

653
00:48:25,214 --> 00:48:27,925
She... brought me the paper.

654
00:48:28,217 --> 00:48:30,178
- What else?
- Nothing.

655
00:48:30,803 --> 00:48:33,222
You aren't lying to me,
are you, my little bird?

656
00:48:33,306 --> 00:48:35,015
No, no, no, I ain't lying to you.

657
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:39,144
If I ever catch you lying,
these are a trifle to what you'll get.

658
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:40,436
A trifle!

659
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:16,305
Come here.

660
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:23,271
Sit down...

661
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:26,399
so that I can look at you, my sweetling.

662
00:49:31,863 --> 00:49:32,863
Say it aloud.

663
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:35,031
What do you mean?

664
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:39,619
Don't you think
I can read your thoughts, you trull?

665
00:49:40,496 --> 00:49:41,539
You hate me, don't you?

666
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:43,374
I'm not good enough for you!

667
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,752
I'm not a nice, kind gentleman like that...

668
00:49:47,712 --> 00:49:52,424
Nice, kind gentlemen
who are so good to look at and so...

669
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,178
Cowards! Weaklings!

670
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:01,184
Tell me you hate me. Please, my lamb.

671
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,799
Please, my dear, sweet, pretty little bird,

672
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:03,894
tell me that you hate me.

673
00:50:04,353 --> 00:50:05,645
I don't know what you mean.

674
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:07,899
Don't you, my lamb?

675
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,859
Then you don't hate me, eh?

676
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:13,403
No, sir.

677
00:50:13,987 --> 00:50:19,159
If you don't hate me, you must love me.
Isn't that so, my little one?

678
00:50:19,826 --> 00:50:21,119
- Isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

679
00:50:21,828 --> 00:50:24,997
Ah! How you must love me.

680
00:50:25,832 --> 00:50:26,875
I want to hear you say it.

681
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,502
Say it. Come, my wench. Say it! Say it!

682
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:30,837
- Say it!
- Yes, sir!

683
00:50:36,384 --> 00:50:38,719
I have got bad news for you, my dear.

684
00:50:40,013 --> 00:50:41,055
Very bad.

685
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:43,348
I, uh...

686
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:47,229
I'm going away for a few days.

687
00:50:51,023 --> 00:50:54,109
And upon my word,
if you don't seem pleased.

688
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:56,821
You are pleased, aren't you?

689
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:59,490
- No, sir, I ain't pleased.
- You are pleased!

690
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,286
But pleasure is brief
in this world, my sweet.

691
00:51:05,371 --> 00:51:08,415
And yours is most uncertain, because...

692
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:13,420
you don't know when I'll be back, do you?

693
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,632
- No, sir.
- "No, sir. No, sir."

694
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,551
Remember, you belong to me, do you hear?

695
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:21,345
You belong to me.

696
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:25,099
If you do one thing
that I don't approve of while I'm gone,

697
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:27,642
the least little thing, mind you...

698
00:51:28,811 --> 00:51:32,231
I'll show you what horror means.

699
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:43,491
Are you going now?

700
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,203
- Tonight?
- Now?

701
00:51:48,997 --> 00:51:51,249
Why, my dear, I'm surprised at you.

702
00:51:52,834 --> 00:51:55,211
What a leave-taking that would be.

703
00:51:56,671 --> 00:51:58,631
You wouldn't have me go tonight, would you?

704
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:01,509
Would you let me go tonight?

705
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:03,343
Would you?

706
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,430
No, sir.

707
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,057
Of course not.

708
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:11,811
Quite unworthy of our great love. Hmm?

709
00:52:14,689 --> 00:52:17,859
No, my dear, I'm not going now.

710
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:21,987
I'm going to spend
the evening here with you.

711
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:25,449
Just as you want. Say, "Just as I want."

712
00:52:25,991 --> 00:52:27,284
Say "Just as I want."

713
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:28,660
Just as I want!

714
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,997
That's right, my little bird.

715
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,459
The last evening
is always the sweetest, you know.

716
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:39,421
And what a farewell this one will be.

717
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:42,049
What a farewell.

718
00:52:43,008 --> 00:52:45,888
I don't know whether I shall be able to
tear myself away from you at all.

719
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:48,262
Perhaps I shall go
only as far as the door...

720
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:51,975
and the sight of your tears
will bring me back.

721
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:54,301
Does that please you, my dear?

722
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:56,896
Yes, sir.

723
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:59,024
Why don't you show it, then?

724
00:52:59,649 --> 00:53:03,278
Why don't you dance? Why don't you sing?

725
00:53:04,154 --> 00:53:05,363
Sing, my dear!

726
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,573
Sing, my little pigeon!

727
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:11,077
Get up and sing! You hear?

728
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:12,702
Sing!

729
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:16,290
Champagne Ivy is my name

730
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:19,460
Champagne Ivy is my name

731
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:23,839
Good for any game at night, my boy

732
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:25,341
Good for...

733
00:53:33,474 --> 00:53:36,143
Look, my darling, how tight your garter is.

734
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:38,187
You mustn't wear it so tight.

735
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:41,315
It will bruise your pretty, tender flesh.

736
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:13,763
Your tea, sir.

737
00:54:14,681 --> 00:54:16,766
Thank you, Poole.

738
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,936
I shall be going out presently.

739
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:23,096
Miss Muriel is returning to London today.

740
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:25,191
Oh, very good, sir.

741
00:54:28,736 --> 00:54:29,736
See this key, Poole?

742
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:31,572
Yes, sir.

743
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:35,492
It's the key to
the back door of the laboratory, sir.

744
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,820
I'll have no further use for it.

745
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:56,346
From now on, I'll use only the front door.

746
00:54:57,055 --> 00:54:58,265
Yes, sir.

747
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:17,034
Deliver this to Miss Ivy Pearson,
Diadem Court, Soho.

748
00:55:18,075 --> 00:55:19,286
Any message, sir?

749
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:21,787
None. Deliver it and come away.

750
00:55:23,207 --> 00:55:25,208
Hyde will kill you one day.

751
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,252
I wish he would kill me.
I wish he would.

752
00:55:27,336 --> 00:55:28,544
Why don't you run away?

753
00:55:29,128 --> 00:55:31,672
Where to? He'd find me wherever I was.

754
00:55:31,756 --> 00:55:35,009
Then why don't you go to the police?
They'd fix this Hyde man.

755
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:36,177
No no, I'm afraid.

756
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:39,347
There ain't nobody to help me. Nobody.

757
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,225
Who cares what becomes of the likes of me?

758
00:55:46,312 --> 00:55:47,312
Come in.

759
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,818
Miss Ivy Pearson?

760
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:55,403
That's me.

761
00:55:55,488 --> 00:55:58,115
This is from my master,
Dr. Jekyll, miss.

762
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:00,575
Not Dr. Henry M. Jekyll?

763
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:04,455
Quite so. He said there is no answer.
Good day, miss.

764
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,127
I don't know Dr. Jekyll.

765
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:15,800
Fifty pounds!

766
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:19,761
Well, he knows you, dearie.

767
00:56:20,595 --> 00:56:22,223
Strike me pink!

768
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:25,268
Fifty pounds
from the celebrated Dr. Jekyll.

769
00:56:25,351 --> 00:56:26,851
He's a grand gentleman.

770
00:56:26,935 --> 00:56:28,813
Always helping them what needs help.

771
00:56:28,896 --> 00:56:31,731
Now, dearie, he sends you fifty pounds.

772
00:56:31,815 --> 00:56:33,400
Shows he takes an interest in you.

773
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:36,403
Now, why don't you go
and thank the gentleman proper?

774
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:39,281
Then you could tell him all about
this here Hyde business.

775
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:41,783
He'll tell that blighter what's what.

776
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,201
You'll see if he don't.

777
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:44,452
You made me suffer so.

778
00:56:45,161 --> 00:56:46,705
Now you tell me nothing.

779
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:48,540
I tell you no man ever needed another,

780
00:56:48,832 --> 00:56:51,710
or loved another as I need and love you.

781
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:53,498
I don't know what to say...

782
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:57,007
but if you'd been ill
that would have been different.

783
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,383
I was ill, my darling.

784
00:56:59,008 --> 00:57:01,428
Then why didn't you let me know?
I should have come at once.

785
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:03,805
I wasn't ill in body. I was ill in soul.

786
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:07,809
The sufferings of the spirit
are so difficult to communicate.

787
00:57:08,268 --> 00:57:09,518
Even to those who love you.

788
00:57:09,852 --> 00:57:11,932
Do you think
there's anything that has to do with you

789
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:13,522
that I wouldn't understand?

790
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:17,610
I know that you're gentle
and understanding, but...

791
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,655
I can't explain to you.

792
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,785
I have played with dangerous knowledge.

793
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:32,458
I've walked a strange and terrible road.

794
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,669
Help me to find my way back.

795
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:37,171
Oh, my sweet.

796
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:40,049
When you're all mine to love and keep,

797
00:57:40,966 --> 00:57:44,385
I shall be patient as the earth with you.

798
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:48,431
Then let's not wait any longer.
Let us be married at once.

799
00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:50,142
I want to with all my heart.

800
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:52,518
Take me. Take me soon.

801
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,479
I love you, and I want to help you.

802
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:56,565
Muriel?

803
00:57:59,985 --> 00:58:00,985
Muriel.

804
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:05,448
I didn't expect to find you here, sir.

805
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:08,117
I've just made my profoundest apologies
to Muriel.

806
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:11,204
- Oh, and what about me?
- Permit me to make them to you, sir,

807
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:13,498
and to trust that you will be indulgent.

808
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,459
You haven't explained anything yet, sir.

809
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:20,129
I... I was not quite myself, sir.

810
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,132
- I was ill.
- Ill? Ill.

811
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,718
Well, in that case, of course,
we'll say no more about it.

812
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:29,681
Thank you, sir. May I take
further advantage of your indulgence?

813
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:31,057
Yes. What is it?

814
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:33,975
Your consent to our early marriage.

815
00:58:34,184 --> 00:58:36,728
Oh, please, Father, do say yes.
Harry needs me.

816
00:58:36,895 --> 00:58:39,399
- I've already told you...
- But we're too unhappy apart.

817
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:42,735
Oh, please, Father. This is
the most important request of my life.

818
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:45,113
I see no reason to change my mind.

819
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:46,905
Isn't my happiness reason enough?

820
00:58:46,988 --> 00:58:49,533
I assure you, sir,
you will have no cause to regret it.

821
00:58:50,033 --> 00:58:51,326
Well, to be frank, Jekyll,

822
00:58:51,785 --> 00:58:53,995
I'm not at all satisfied with your conduct.

823
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:55,741
I don't understand you, sir.

824
00:58:56,248 --> 00:59:00,877
I expect a man in your position
to observe certain traditions.

825
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,964
I want to see you more settled down

826
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:06,049
before I entrust my daughter to your care.

827
00:59:06,466 --> 00:59:08,510
You're too flighty, too impatient...

828
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:11,054
Believe me, sir,
these faults will be corrected.

829
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:12,722
I give you my word of honor.

830
00:59:12,805 --> 00:59:15,808
Please, Father.
My whole life is concerned.

831
00:59:15,891 --> 00:59:17,728
- Hm. Hm.
- Please?

832
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:20,230
Well...

833
00:59:20,897 --> 00:59:23,190
Well, well, I see you're overriding me.

834
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:26,777
Jekyll, remember you gave me
your word of honor.

835
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:27,861
Yes, sir.

836
00:59:28,738 --> 00:59:31,074
Very well.
You shall be married next month.

837
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:33,200
Come to dinner tomorrow, eh?

838
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:35,657
And we'll make a formal announcement
to our friends.

839
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:37,789
Oh, thank you, sir.
By Jove, you've made me happy!

840
00:59:37,873 --> 00:59:39,874
I could sing or dance, or roll a hoop...

841
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:42,793
- Jekyll, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, I beg your pardon, sir.

842
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:44,086
Until tomorrow, my sweet.

843
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,756
Goodb... good... goodbye, sir.

844
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:48,883
Goodbye.

845
00:59:59,143 --> 01:00:01,603
Ah, Poole, my dear fellow.

846
01:00:02,354 --> 01:00:04,064
I'm a very happy man!

847
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:05,900
I'm happy to hear it.

848
01:00:05,983 --> 01:00:08,651
Ah, happy, by Jove! Happy!

849
01:00:09,153 --> 01:00:12,363
"Jocund Day Stands Tip Toe
on the Misty Mountain Tops."

850
01:00:12,448 --> 01:00:13,448
Yes, sir.

851
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:16,035
May I take your cape, sir?

852
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:18,995
You may, Poole, you may, my dear fellow.

853
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,456
I'm going to be married, Poole.
Next month.

854
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:24,542
Think of it. In a few weeks,
she'll be under this very roof,

855
01:00:24,751 --> 01:00:27,337
in this very room, as my wife.

856
01:00:27,796 --> 01:00:30,007
Think of it, Poole,
and let me see your face.

857
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:34,260
Yes, sir!
I beg to congratulate you, sir!

858
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:38,890
"If music be the food of love, play on."

859
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:41,309
Yes.

860
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,708
I beg your pardon, sir,

861
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,837
but Miss Pearson is waiting for you
in the consulting room.

862
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,963
Miss Pearson?

863
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,215
The young woman
that you sent the envelope to, sir.

864
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:18,011
- What does she want?
- She wishes to consult you, sir.

865
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,896
- Very well. Show her in here.
- Yes, sir.

866
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:51,253
Why, it's you, sir!

867
01:01:51,919 --> 01:01:52,919
So it is.

868
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:55,506
Now who would have thought it?

869
01:01:56,549 --> 01:02:00,136
Who would have thought that I'd find
the celebrated Dr. Jekyll?

870
01:02:02,722 --> 01:02:05,349
So it was you who sent me this money?

871
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:07,059
Yes.

872
01:02:08,394 --> 01:02:11,564
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you had a kind heart.

873
01:02:12,523 --> 01:02:13,858
But whatever made you do it, sir?

874
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:15,341
Someone told me that you needed it.

875
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:17,731
- Who, sir?
- Doesn't matter.

876
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:19,378
The important thing is that you have it.

877
01:02:19,655 --> 01:02:20,655
And you're welcome to it.

878
01:02:21,656 --> 01:02:22,825
I can't take it, sir.

879
01:02:24,201 --> 01:02:27,163
- Why not?
- Why? Why?

880
01:02:27,705 --> 01:02:29,665
Here's why! Here's why!

881
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:31,249
Pretty, ain't it?

882
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:33,336
It's a whip, that's what it is. A whip.

883
01:02:33,461 --> 01:02:35,045
Horrible. Horrible!

884
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:37,672
I'll give you a lotion to soothe that.

885
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:41,092
Thank you, sir,
but a lotion won't do the trick, sir.

886
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:43,596
No, sir. It's more than that, sir.

887
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:47,058
I need help, I do.
I can't stand it anymore.

888
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:50,478
- What is it, my dear?
- It's Hyde, sir. Hyde.

889
01:02:51,019 --> 01:02:54,105
It's him that's done that,
and more as I can't tell you, sir.

890
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:57,026
He ain't human, he ain't, sir.
He's a beast.

891
01:02:57,776 --> 01:02:59,611
He won't let me go, and I'm afraid...

892
01:02:59,694 --> 01:03:01,112
I'm afraid to run away.

893
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:03,740
I've tried to drown myself...

894
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:05,992
but I can't.

895
01:03:07,577 --> 01:03:08,870
And if you don't help me...

896
01:03:09,746 --> 01:03:12,916
You as has the kindest heart
in the world, sir...

897
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,086
then give me poison, so I can kill myself.

898
01:03:16,169 --> 01:03:18,620
Why didn't you seek help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?

899
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,631
I was afraid.

900
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:23,092
You don't know him, sir.
He ain't a man. He's a devil.

901
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:25,436
He knows
what you're thinking about, he does.

902
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:28,138
I'm afraid of him.
I'm afraid of him now!

903
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:31,350
If he knows that I've been here today,
I don't know what he'll do!

904
01:03:31,726 --> 01:03:33,644
It won't be anything human, sir.

905
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,647
Oh, save me. Save me!

906
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,733
Keep him off me.
I'll do anything you ask.

907
01:03:38,817 --> 01:03:40,985
I'll be your slave!

908
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,112
Oh, help me!

909
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:00,254
You won't let me go back to him,
will you, sir?

910
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,173
You're an angel.

911
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,220
You're an angel, sir.

912
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:15,351
I'll do anything you like.

913
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:18,896
I ain't as bad as you think.

914
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,442
And I ain't a bad looker, either.

915
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,488
I'll work for you. I'll slave for you.

916
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,282
I'll love you.

917
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:34,328
You... you liked me once, didn't you?

918
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,706
Why don't you?

919
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,473
I give you my word...

920
01:04:55,432 --> 01:04:57,091
that you will never be troubled
with Hyde again.

921
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,562
No, no, sir.
He'll come back and he'll kill me, sir!

922
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,272
He will not come back. I'll see to it.

923
01:05:02,355 --> 01:05:05,400
But you don't know him, sir.
He ain't human, he ain't.

924
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,572
I've given you my word,
and that I never break.

925
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:12,616
You will not see Hyde again.

926
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:15,368
Believe me.

927
01:05:18,872 --> 01:05:19,956
I believe you, sir.

928
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,210
I believe you.

929
01:05:31,176 --> 01:05:32,219
You must go now.

930
01:05:33,178 --> 01:05:34,179
Yes, sir.

931
01:05:35,472 --> 01:05:36,473
Yes, sir.

932
01:05:38,475 --> 01:05:39,476
Yes, sir.

933
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:04,959
Begging your pardon, sir.
Will it be a large affair?

934
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:08,379
Not particularly.
General Carew's cronies, chiefly.

935
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:10,887
They wouldn't regard the marriage
as authentic,

936
01:06:10,965 --> 01:06:13,592
unless it were formally announced
at a dinner table, you know?

937
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:17,680
Perhaps soon, sir, you'll be giving
a formal dinner yourself, sir.

938
01:06:17,763 --> 01:06:18,972
I may, Poole, I may.

939
01:06:19,055 --> 01:06:21,350
- Should I call a hansom, sir?
- No, thank you.

940
01:06:21,433 --> 01:06:22,799
A walk through the park will do me good.

941
01:06:22,809 --> 01:06:23,644
Yes, sir.

942
01:06:23,727 --> 01:06:25,854
- We're early.
- I'm glad you are.

943
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:29,190
My dear, of course,
I wish you all happiness. All happiness.

944
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,652
- Oh, thank you, Dr. Lanyon.
- How are you, General?

945
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:55,091
"Thou wast not born for death,
immortal Bird!"

946
01:06:56,092 --> 01:06:58,595
"No hungry generations tread thee down."

947
01:07:02,223 --> 01:07:04,641
"Thou wast not born for death..."

948
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:09,606
Oh, no. Oh!

949
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:26,748
"Thou wast not born for death..."

950
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:06,827
But it is dead. Dead!

951
01:08:30,226 --> 01:08:31,269
Rather late.

952
01:08:36,315 --> 01:08:37,900
It's very queer that he's not here.

953
01:08:37,984 --> 01:08:39,276
I don't understand it.

954
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:46,993
Of course, he's a very busy man.
He was probably detained.

955
01:08:49,327 --> 01:08:51,570
Do you think anything could have
happened to Harry, Mr. Utterson?

956
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,874
On a night like this, my dear? Nonsense.

957
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:55,293
Why is he late then?

958
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:57,003
There, there, my dear.

959
01:08:57,086 --> 01:08:59,379
It's not his lateness,
it's your impatience.

960
01:08:59,671 --> 01:09:00,923
He'll be along presently.

961
01:09:02,632 --> 01:09:03,633
I hope so.

962
01:09:05,343 --> 01:09:06,343
I hope so.

963
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:28,157
Here's hoping that Hyde rots
wherever he is,

964
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:30,618
and burns where he ought to be.

965
01:09:34,372 --> 01:09:35,457
And here's hoping that

966
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:40,128
Dr. Jekyll will think of Ivy
once in a while.

967
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:42,922
He's an angel, he is.

968
01:09:44,631 --> 01:09:46,968
Here's to you, my angel.

969
01:10:22,169 --> 01:10:23,929
You thought I wouldn't come back,
didn't you?

970
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:27,355
You took the word of that
sniveling hypocrite Jekyll against mine.

971
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:30,510
Jekyll's word against Hyde's, eh?

972
01:10:31,135 --> 01:10:34,347
I know everything you do
and everything you think!

973
01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:36,974
You went down on your knees before him.

974
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:39,560
The man I hate more
than anybody in the world!

975
01:10:39,644 --> 01:10:41,145
- No!
- No?

976
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:46,484
"I'll slave for you. I'll love you.
You're an angel, sir."

977
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,654
You wanted him to love you, didn't you?

978
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,615
I'll give you a lover now.

979
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,952
His name is death!

980
01:10:56,035 --> 01:10:58,287
No, no, it ain't so! No!

981
01:10:59,497 --> 01:11:00,706
It ain't so!

982
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:04,293
Oh, ain't it so, my little bird?

983
01:11:04,377 --> 01:11:06,212
My little starling.

984
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:08,714
Why, you lying wench!

985
01:11:09,256 --> 01:11:10,550
You've got his money here now!

986
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,509
You must be the devil.

987
01:11:12,759 --> 01:11:14,595
There was nobody there
but me and Dr. Jekyll.

988
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:17,181
He wouldn't have told you!
No, he wouldn't!

989
01:11:17,265 --> 01:11:19,766
Wouldn't he, though? Wouldn't he?

990
01:11:20,226 --> 01:11:21,935
Listen, my dear. Listen!

991
01:11:22,436 --> 01:11:24,230
I'm going to let you into a secret.

992
01:11:24,939 --> 01:11:26,731
A secret so great,

993
01:11:27,233 --> 01:11:29,985
that those who share it with me
cannot live!

994
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,822
I am...

995
01:11:37,117 --> 01:11:41,289
I am the angel whom you wanted to
slave for and love!

996
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,625
And I'm going to take you in my arms now
and hold you close!

997
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:46,585
Close, my little lamb.

998
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:49,379
My dove! My bird!

999
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:14,695
There, my sweet.

1000
01:12:15,738 --> 01:12:18,699
There, my dove.

1001
01:12:19,533 --> 01:12:23,038
There, my little bride.

1002
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:28,209
Isn't Hyde a lover after your own heart?

1003
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:44,298
Oh, there's something horrible
happening up there!

1004
01:12:44,308 --> 01:12:45,674
- Did you hear it?
- Go up, I tell you.

1005
01:12:45,684 --> 01:12:48,062
- Come on.
- Something horrible...

1006
01:12:50,855 --> 01:12:52,942
- You murdering devil!
- Help, help!

1007
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:00,740
Stop! Stop him!

1008
01:13:13,419 --> 01:13:14,254
A monster did this.

1009
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:16,839
I know him. I know him.
His name is Hyde.

1010
01:13:50,957 --> 01:13:52,155
Let me in. I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll.

1011
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:53,208
Dr. Jekyll isn't at home.

1012
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:55,252
Oh, I know it, you fool!

1013
01:13:55,335 --> 01:13:56,628
He told me to wait for him.

1014
01:13:56,753 --> 01:13:58,547
You'll have to come back later.

1015
01:13:59,214 --> 01:14:00,654
Open that door, or I'll break it in!

1016
01:14:09,683 --> 01:14:11,852
My dear, I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1017
01:14:12,686 --> 01:14:13,604
And I hope with all my heart

1018
01:14:13,687 --> 01:14:15,687
that Jekyll will have something to say
for himself.

1019
01:14:17,274 --> 01:14:18,834
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Lanyon.

1020
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:24,739
I'll cane that scoundrel Jekyll
if I ever set eyes on him again.

1021
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:26,825
No, Father.
Something terrible must have happened.

1022
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:29,286
I'm sure he can explain.
I believe in him.

1023
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:31,579
I forbid you to see this man again.

1024
01:14:32,288 --> 01:14:34,457
I love him, Father,
and I'm going to marry him.

1025
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:38,419
Muriel, you will have nothing more to do
with that man.

1026
01:14:38,794 --> 01:14:41,255
- Give me pencil and paper. Quick!
- Yes, sir.

1027
01:14:41,339 --> 01:14:44,133
Hey, you.
Be ready to carry a message for me.

1028
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:45,425
Yes, sir.

1029
01:14:50,973 --> 01:14:52,413
- Hello, Briggs.
- Good evening, sir.

1030
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,728
I beg your pardon, sir.

1031
01:14:56,979 --> 01:14:58,773
A messenger brought this
a little while ago.

1032
01:14:58,856 --> 01:15:01,067
- Really?
- He said it was very important.

1033
01:15:31,221 --> 01:15:33,181
I'm going out, Briggs,
but I'll be back soon.

1034
01:15:33,264 --> 01:15:34,265
Yes, sir.

1035
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:39,479
Oh. You may go to bed.

1036
01:15:40,021 --> 01:15:42,101
- I won't need you anymore tonight.
- Thank you, sir.

1037
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:03,378
- I come from Dr. Jekyll.
- Come in.

1038
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,840
Have you got it?

1039
01:16:09,049 --> 01:16:10,050
Follow me.

1040
01:16:15,764 --> 01:16:16,764
Have you got it?

1041
01:16:17,392 --> 01:16:18,392
Have you got it?

1042
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:19,934
Come, sir.

1043
01:16:20,018 --> 01:16:22,218
You forget I have not
the pleasure of your acquaintance.

1044
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:23,930
I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon.

1045
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:26,608
You know what I came for.
Dr. Jekyll sent me.

1046
01:16:26,984 --> 01:16:29,403
It's important. A package.

1047
01:16:29,486 --> 01:16:30,654
- Is it here?
- Yes.

1048
01:16:35,451 --> 01:16:36,618
Here it is.

1049
01:16:36,702 --> 01:16:37,910
But before I give it to you,

1050
01:16:38,537 --> 01:16:40,748
I must be
assured of Dr. Jekyll's safety.

1051
01:16:41,874 --> 01:16:43,667
- Where is he?
- He's alive and safe.

1052
01:16:43,751 --> 01:16:45,511
- I'll take these to him.
- I'll go with you.

1053
01:16:46,086 --> 01:16:47,712
I must see for myself that Jekyll is...

1054
01:16:47,795 --> 01:16:49,089
This is no concern of yours!

1055
01:16:49,173 --> 01:16:50,340
I warn you not to meddle.

1056
01:16:50,424 --> 01:16:52,944
You will take me to Dr. Jekyll,
or you will not leave this room.

1057
01:16:53,635 --> 01:16:54,955
I warn you, Lanyon, to let me go.

1058
01:16:54,969 --> 01:16:57,289
And I warn you, if you make another step
towards that door,

1059
01:16:57,805 --> 01:16:58,805
I'll shoot you.

1060
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:00,673
You don't know what you're doing.
I can't tell you anything.

1061
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,226
Ask Jekyll tomorrow if you want to.

1062
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:05,188
I'll be sure of Dr. Jekyll's safety,
or I'll make you answer for it.

1063
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:11,152
For the last time, Lanyon,
will you let me go?

1064
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:12,235
For the last time, no.

1065
01:17:14,322 --> 01:17:15,322
Very well, Lanyon.

1066
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:18,409
This be on your own head.

1067
01:17:52,276 --> 01:17:53,276
Now, Lanyon...

1068
01:17:54,986 --> 01:17:58,031
will you let me take this glass
and leave without further question?

1069
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:00,909
I've gone too far
not to see this through to the end.

1070
01:18:00,992 --> 01:18:02,536
Think before you decide, I tell you!

1071
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:05,330
Do you want to be left as you are...

1072
01:18:06,122 --> 01:18:08,999
or do you want your eyes and your soul
to be blasted

1073
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:11,419
by a sight that would stagger
the devil himself?

1074
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:13,588
I'm not to be persuaded by this rigmarole.

1075
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:14,672
Very well, Lanyon.

1076
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:18,759
Remember your vows to your profession.

1077
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:23,723
What you are about to see is a secret
you are sworn not to reveal.

1078
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:31,189
And now, you who have sneered at
the miracles of science,

1079
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:36,151
you who have denied the power of man
to look into his own soul,

1080
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:39,488
you who have derided your superiors...

1081
01:18:40,531 --> 01:18:41,531
Look!

1082
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,200
Look.

1083
01:20:03,654 --> 01:20:05,114
I can't believe what I've seen.

1084
01:20:06,573 --> 01:20:07,824
I don't understand.

1085
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:09,910
I'm in your hands to do with as you wish.

1086
01:20:09,993 --> 01:20:11,078
Horrible. Horrible.

1087
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:13,205
I'm a murderer, Lanyon.
Help me. Help me.

1088
01:20:13,288 --> 01:20:14,665
There is no help for you, Jekyll.

1089
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,833
You've committed the supreme blasphemy.

1090
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:18,417
I warned you.

1091
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:21,161
I told you that no man could violate
the traditions of his kind

1092
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:22,006
and not be damned.

1093
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,423
That I still do not believe.

1094
01:20:24,508 --> 01:20:27,167
Don't be my inquisitor, Lanyon.
Don't judge me. Help me, if you will.

1095
01:20:27,177 --> 01:20:29,846
- I'm at your mercy.
- There is no help for you here...

1096
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:32,056
or mercy beyond.

1097
01:20:33,183 --> 01:20:34,183
You're a rebel...

1098
01:20:35,185 --> 01:20:36,812
and see what it has done for you.

1099
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:40,649
You're in the power of this monster
that you've created.

1100
01:20:41,024 --> 01:20:42,483
I'll never take that drug again.

1101
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:46,571
Yes, but you told me
you became that monster tonight

1102
01:20:46,947 --> 01:20:48,198
not of your own accord.

1103
01:20:49,448 --> 01:20:50,448
It will happen again.

1104
01:20:50,492 --> 01:20:53,327
Never. I'm sure of it.
I'll fight it. I'll conquer it.

1105
01:20:53,411 --> 01:20:54,871
Too late. You cannot conquer it.

1106
01:20:56,247 --> 01:20:57,499
It has conquered you.

1107
01:20:57,874 --> 01:20:59,750
No, no, no. I'll fight it.

1108
01:21:00,042 --> 01:21:01,545
I know it will not happen again.

1109
01:21:02,628 --> 01:21:03,628
Oh, help me.

1110
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,051
You'll promise at least
never to mix this drug again?

1111
01:21:08,134 --> 01:21:09,385
With all my heart.

1112
01:21:12,013 --> 01:21:14,558
And what about... Muriel?

1113
01:21:19,103 --> 01:21:20,104
I'll give her up.

1114
01:21:23,858 --> 01:21:24,858
I'll go to her tomorrow.

1115
01:21:28,612 --> 01:21:29,612
Set her free.

1116
01:22:11,154 --> 01:22:14,616
Oh, God... this I did not intend.

1117
01:22:16,658 --> 01:22:17,658
I saw a light...

1118
01:22:19,204 --> 01:22:20,844
but I could not see where it was leading.

1119
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,376
I have trespassed on your domain.

1120
01:22:27,628 --> 01:22:31,591
I've gone further than man should go.

1121
01:22:33,258 --> 01:22:36,178
Forgive me. Help me.

1122
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,139
I beg your pardon, sir.
Dr. Jekyll is calling.

1123
01:24:04,222 --> 01:24:05,222
Jekyll?

1124
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:07,591
Tell him we're not at home, Hobson.

1125
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:08,768
Father, no, for my sake.

1126
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:10,645
He dares to enter this house?

1127
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:12,529
Neither you nor I
have the right to judge him.

1128
01:24:12,606 --> 01:24:14,232
Judge him? Are you mad?

1129
01:24:14,524 --> 01:24:15,567
The fellow's a blackguard.

1130
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,330
I won't hear you say one word against him.

1131
01:24:18,278 --> 01:24:19,739
- Show him in, Hobson.
- But I...

1132
01:24:19,822 --> 01:24:20,822
Father.

1133
01:24:22,908 --> 01:24:24,028
I don't know what he's done,

1134
01:24:24,367 --> 01:24:26,746
but I know he's a finer
and greater person than any of us.

1135
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:29,456
- Silence! I won't hear another word.
- I shall say it.

1136
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:32,810
We've never understood him.
We've never tried to understand him.

1137
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:35,884
You tried to bend him to your will
and I haven't fought for him enough.

1138
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:38,851
I don't know what's happened to him,
but I know he's been suffering.

1139
01:24:39,216 --> 01:24:41,551
And it's our fault.
Mine more than yours.

1140
01:24:42,802 --> 01:24:44,596
I love him, and I'm going to help him.

1141
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:47,766
This is preposterous!
I'll have nothing to do with it.

1142
01:24:56,899 --> 01:24:58,568
I can offer you no welcome, sir.

1143
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:03,197
Had the matter been left in my hands,
I would have turned you from the door.

1144
01:25:24,468 --> 01:25:25,468
Forgive me.

1145
01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:28,639
Forgive me, Muriel.

1146
01:25:30,349 --> 01:25:31,349
Forgive me.

1147
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:33,435
Oh, my darling, are you ill?

1148
01:25:34,103 --> 01:25:35,103
Oh, what is it?

1149
01:25:35,145 --> 01:25:37,314
What? What is it?

1150
01:25:38,315 --> 01:25:40,359
My sweet, why are you suffering so?

1151
01:25:41,568 --> 01:25:43,361
- Tell me. Tell me what it is.
- Tell you?

1152
01:25:46,656 --> 01:25:47,741
I've come to tell you.

1153
01:25:50,285 --> 01:25:53,121
I've come to... to set you free.

1154
01:25:55,164 --> 01:25:57,041
- Set me free?
- Yes. Yes.

1155
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:58,459
What are you saying?

1156
01:25:58,543 --> 01:26:00,753
Oh, if you ever loved me,
tell me what's wrong.

1157
01:26:01,171 --> 01:26:02,255
Everything's wrong.

1158
01:26:04,716 --> 01:26:06,175
I... I no longer...

1159
01:26:07,552 --> 01:26:08,845
have any claim on you.

1160
01:26:08,928 --> 01:26:11,305
- But that's for me to say.
- No. No.

1161
01:26:11,388 --> 01:26:13,933
Oh, my darling,
I beg you to tell me. What is it?

1162
01:26:16,269 --> 01:26:18,312
No. No, you don't have to
explain anything.

1163
01:26:19,689 --> 01:26:21,982
Whatever it is,
I know you've done nothing base or mean.

1164
01:26:22,066 --> 01:26:23,526
Oh, please, my dear!

1165
01:26:23,609 --> 01:26:25,945
Please... please, angel of God...

1166
01:26:27,362 --> 01:26:28,655
don't say anymore.

1167
01:26:31,783 --> 01:26:32,994
I set you free.

1168
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:35,839
Darling, is that all you have to say to me?

1169
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,915
- Don't you want me any longer?
- Want you?

1170
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:44,171
I want you so that I can envy the damned.

1171
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:47,716
I am damned.

1172
01:26:47,799 --> 01:26:49,176
You don't know what you're saying.

1173
01:26:50,302 --> 01:26:51,511
Do you think I'd let you go?

1174
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:53,722
Only tell me that you love me
and I'm yours.

1175
01:26:54,097 --> 01:26:55,891
Oh, don't keep anything from me, darling.

1176
01:26:56,099 --> 01:26:58,226
- I love you, and I'll help you.
- Oh, my love.

1177
01:26:58,935 --> 01:27:01,355
My darling. My beautiful.

1178
01:27:02,356 --> 01:27:03,814
If I could take you in my arms...

1179
01:27:04,941 --> 01:27:06,318
If I could only touch you...

1180
01:27:08,445 --> 01:27:09,446
Oh, think of it.

1181
01:27:11,156 --> 01:27:14,158
I daren't even touch you ever again...

1182
01:27:14,993 --> 01:27:16,410
in this world or the next.

1183
01:27:16,494 --> 01:27:18,413
Oh, what are you hiding from me?

1184
01:27:18,497 --> 01:27:21,123
Oh, trust me, believe in me.
I'll help you.

1185
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:23,501
No. I'm beyond help, Muriel!

1186
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:25,085
I'm in hell!

1187
01:27:26,712 --> 01:27:29,132
I... I'm in hell.

1188
01:27:30,424 --> 01:27:31,634
I must give you up!

1189
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:33,427
- But I won't let you.
- No.

1190
01:27:33,844 --> 01:27:35,346
I'll go with you wherever you say.

1191
01:27:35,805 --> 01:27:37,223
I'll help you no matter what it is.

1192
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:40,726
If I... if I could only have you,

1193
01:27:41,394 --> 01:27:45,106
I'd give my soul, but I...
I have no soul.

1194
01:27:46,774 --> 01:27:48,067
I'm beyond the pale!

1195
01:27:49,777 --> 01:27:51,112
I'm one of the living dead!

1196
01:27:51,195 --> 01:27:52,947
Oh, I won't let you go!

1197
01:27:53,572 --> 01:27:55,573
My poor, dear, suffering love.

1198
01:27:56,116 --> 01:27:58,494
Be quiet. Rest. Don't say anymore.

1199
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:02,080
Be quiet and rest. Rest.

1200
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:05,959
Be quiet. Don't say anymore, darling.

1201
01:28:09,504 --> 01:28:11,340
Oh, let me go. Let me go quickly.

1202
01:28:11,424 --> 01:28:13,550
No, no, I love you. I won't let you go.

1203
01:28:14,176 --> 01:28:15,260
I love you.

1204
01:28:15,343 --> 01:28:17,972
Oh, sweetheart.

1205
01:28:18,054 --> 01:28:19,514
No! No!

1206
01:28:20,891 --> 01:28:23,852
I give you up because I love you so.

1207
01:28:24,644 --> 01:28:28,189
This is my proof. This is my penance.

1208
01:28:29,065 --> 01:28:30,358
Do you hear, oh, God?

1209
01:28:31,609 --> 01:28:33,862
This is my penance!

1210
01:29:37,632 --> 01:29:40,134
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1211
01:29:40,259 --> 01:29:42,638
Don't let me. Don't let me.
Save me. Save me.

1212
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:40,778
Why, dar...

1213
01:30:43,613 --> 01:30:46,074
Help me!

1214
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:49,202
- Father, help!
- Hey!

1215
01:30:49,828 --> 01:30:51,246
Oh, you...

1216
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:55,500
Hobson! Hobson!

1217
01:30:58,002 --> 01:30:59,462
Hobson, get him!

1218
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:00,755
You, out!

1219
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:26,071
Help! Help! Police! Police!

1220
01:31:26,155 --> 01:31:27,990
You stay here.
I'll follow him.

1221
01:31:28,991 --> 01:31:29,991
There he goes!

1222
01:31:46,633 --> 01:31:47,635
This way, Officer.

1223
01:31:58,228 --> 01:31:59,228
Stop him!

1224
01:32:15,036 --> 01:32:16,496
Stop! Police!

1225
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:30,213
This is the weapon, Doctor.

1226
01:32:34,222 --> 01:32:35,347
I know whose cane this is.

1227
01:32:36,391 --> 01:32:37,517
I can take you to the man.

1228
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,440
- Break it down!
- Open in the name of the law.

1229
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:41,332
Come on, Bill. Give it your shoulder.

1230
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:49,861
This one's locked, too.

1231
01:32:50,446 --> 01:32:52,614
- Open in the name of the law.
- He's in there.

1232
01:32:53,616 --> 01:32:56,493
- Break it down! Break it down!
- Open in the name of the law.

1233
01:33:12,134 --> 01:33:13,134
Where is he?

1234
01:33:13,218 --> 01:33:15,053
He's gone out there, through the backdoor.

1235
01:33:16,888 --> 01:33:18,974
Don't stand there staring, you fool!

1236
01:33:19,266 --> 01:33:20,600
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1237
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,580
The door down there's
locked on the outside.

1238
01:33:31,652 --> 01:33:33,437
Well, then go out
through the front of the house.

1239
01:33:33,447 --> 01:33:34,447
Come on, Stonie.

1240
01:33:34,905 --> 01:33:36,116
- You stay here.
- Wait.

1241
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,451
He has escaped, sir.

1242
01:33:39,536 --> 01:33:40,745
Your man has not escaped.

1243
01:33:51,589 --> 01:33:52,589
There.

1244
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:55,760
There he is. There's your man.

1245
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:58,012
But, Doctor, this is impossible.

1246
01:33:58,554 --> 01:34:01,056
I know it is, but there's your man.

1247
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:04,018
I'm sorry, sir.
You appear to be serious, but...

1248
01:34:04,101 --> 01:34:05,101
Look!

1249
01:34:23,411 --> 01:34:25,456
Hold him! Hold him!

1250
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:28,709
Hold him. Hold him.

1251
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,965
Guard that door.

1252
01:34:36,966 --> 01:34:38,051
Guard that door there.

1253
01:34:38,426 --> 01:34:39,511
Don't let him get away.

1254
01:34:41,012 --> 01:34:42,472
Look out!

1255
01:34:54,692 --> 01:34:55,526
Come on, boys.

1256
01:34:55,609 --> 01:34:57,237
Drop that knife!

1257
01:35:36,108 --> 01:35:39,152
Dr. Jekyll.
