1
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,138
Dartmoor prison.

2
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:23,307
Isolated from the outside world

3
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:25,432
by walls of granite.

4
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:37,731
They say you could get out of here

5
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,610
by merely telling what you know.

6
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:45,279
You may or may not be
another Scotland Yard bloke

7
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:49,827
but I'll give you the same
answer I gave the others.

8
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:54,365
I still have two years,
eight months and six days left

9
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:56,984
in which to make musical boxes

10
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,622
that will be sold at auction

11
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:03,332
for the benefit of this
delightful sanctuary.

12
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,237
And I intend to sell them.

13
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:12,204
Move along.

14
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:17,196
And now we come to the next object
on our list, or I should say objects

15
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,176
because there are three of them.

16
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:23,704
Now ladies and gentlemen these can
be bought together or separately.

17
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,063
Now these beautiful little musical
boxes only arrived this morning

18
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,452
and I didn't intend to put them
on the auction block until later

19
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:31,391
but I'm going to sell them now.

20
00:02:31,457 --> 00:02:34,940
So good friends, as our old
pal Mark Anthony used to say,

21
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:38,018
"lend me your ears

22
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:39,817
and what do you hear?"

23
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,027
♪♪Right,

24
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:46,105
the beautiful tinkle,
tinkle of a musical box.

25
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:48,864
What a lovely trinket.
What a beautiful gift,

26
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,694
created and made by loving hands.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,862
A thing of beauty and utility.

28
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:56,871
I was going to start with five pounds.

29
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,160
It's a bargain for five pounds.

30
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:02,079
Do I see any hands?

31
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:06,118
Is there a connoisseur in the house
who'll go three pounds for it?

32
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,563
Two pounds?

33
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,802
One pound?

34
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,005
Ten shillings?

35
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:16,714
Ten? Thank you, sir.

36
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,923
Ladies and gentlemen,

37
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,052
ten shillings is offered for a musical box

38
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,051
you couldn't buy anywhere in
London for less than five pounds.

39
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:25,420
It's a bit of a stealing to
let it go for ten shillings,

40
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:26,970
like taking milk from a baby.

41
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:28,639
All right, we start with ten shillings.

42
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,139
Ten shillings, ten shillings is offered.

43
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,468
Ten shillings is offered.
Ten shillings is offered.

44
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:32,808
Does anybody want to give me one pound?

45
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,477
Anybody one pound?

46
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:36,136
Won't somebody give me a pound?

47
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:38,055
A pound, one pound is offered, one pound.

48
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,645
Ladies and gentlemen one pound.

49
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,564
The offer is against you, sir.
Will you go to two pounds?

50
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,933
Will you go to two pounds, sir?

51
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,353
Two pounds.
Two pounds is offered.

52
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:46,982
Two pounds offered going once,

53
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,062
twice,

54
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,441
third and the last call.

55
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:53,190
Sold to the gentlemen for two pounds.

56
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:55,149
Sorry, my dear.

57
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:58,868
Now ladies and gentlemen comes
the opportunity to purchase

58
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,407
an exact duplicate of the
beautiful little musical box

59
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:04,446
just bought by this gentleman
for the ridiculous low price

60
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,455
of two pounds.

61
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:06,995
Now, it's exactly the same.

62
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,994
Exactly the same.
Made by the same hands.

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,993
You hear that?
Isn't that lovely.

64
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,292
That tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.

65
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,752
Sounds like bow bells to me.

66
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:16,870
You know, with little angels
pulling on the ropes.

67
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:18,380
Who will give me two pounds for it?

68
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:19,589
Who will start me with two pounds?

69
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,709
Will anybody start me with two pounds?

70
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,048
Oh come, come ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,967
if you offer more enthusiasm we might
all be Scotland instead of London.

72
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,756
Please buy it for me, Daddy.

73
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:30,296
Two pounds? Certainly not.

74
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,215
We all might be in Scotland.

75
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,214
Besides I don't like his manner.

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,884
One pound, ten shillings.

77
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,843
One pound. One pound is asked.

78
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,092
One pound? One pound is offered.

79
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,762
One pound is offered.
Going, one pound.

80
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:43,391
In advance.
Going once, going twice,

81
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:46,270
the third and the last call.

82
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,558
Sold to the lady for one pound.

83
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,188
Smart bidding, my dear.

84
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:51,268
Thank you.

85
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:52,687
We come to the third and last

86
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:55,276
of these beautiful little musical boxes.

87
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:58,855
Exactly the same tinkle,
tinkle. Isn't that lovely?

88
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:00,154
Ladies and gentlemen
I don't bring you here

89
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,864
to gull you and swindle you,

90
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,088
this is the exact replica of
those two I just sold before.

91
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,039
We're closed.

92
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,854
But this is extremely important.

93
00:05:17,974 --> 00:05:18,917
Come in, sir. Come in.

94
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:20,577
I'm sorry to disturb you

95
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,456
but I was unfortunately delayed

96
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,915
from arriving in time to
bid on certain articles,

97
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,914
which I was rather anxious to obtain.

98
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,623
Well, perhaps they weren't sold, sir.

99
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,793
We are carrying several things over.

100
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,922
What might the articles be, sir?

101
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:36,920
Three identical musical
boxes about so large.

102
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:39,549
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but they were sold.

103
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:41,089
Pitty you weren't here to bid on them.

104
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:43,558
They didn't bring anything
like their real value.

105
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:45,847
I'm most anxious to obtain them.

106
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,516
I wonder if your records would show

107
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:49,476
who the purchases were?

108
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:52,433
Oh, we don't usually give
out that information, sir.

109
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,523
For certain, shall we say,
sentimental reasons

110
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,692
I'm most anxious to get in
touch with the purchasers.

111
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,401
I'd be willing to pay, shall we say,

112
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,770
five pounds.

113
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:05,439
Well for certain sentimental reasons, sir,

114
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,109
we'd be very happy to oblige.

115
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:10,108
Alfred, today's sales,
the three musical boxes.

116
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:12,197
The musical boxes, oh.

117
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:14,326
Ah, here we are.

118
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:17,155
The first purchased for two pounds by
Mr. Julian Emery, 52 Portland Square.

119
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:19,574
- Write these addresses down, Alfred.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,954
Second, didn't leave any name.

121
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,663
Well, how unfortunate.

122
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,452
I think she's a dealer.

123
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,742
You see, they don't like us to
know where the things are going.

124
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,541
On account of the profits.

125
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:30,750
You say the second purchaser,
there was a woman,

126
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:33,039
can you give me a description of her?

127
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:36,548
Oh, she was a young woman,
fairly tall, slender,

128
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:39,466
a light complexion and dark hair,

129
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,715
- and she was wearing a...
- A gray suit, don't you remember?

130
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:45,384
- That's right.
- She probably runs a gift shop.

131
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,383
She paid one pound.

132
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,592
You say she comes here fairly frequently?

133
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:54,931
No, I didn't say so but she does, sir.

134
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,930
Likely, she'll come in on Thursday.

135
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,308
We have sales on Monday's and Thursday's.

136
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,648
Ah. And the third box?

137
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:06,776
The third, oh, a Mr. William
Kilgour, 143B Hampton Way.

138
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,565
For ten shillings.

139
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:10,525
Quite a drop from two pounds.

140
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,444
Mr. Kilgour was a Scotchman.

141
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,322
Well, thank you.
You've been most helpful.

142
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:18,402
Thank you, sir

143
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,571
and anytime your passing drop in.

144
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:22,530
We always have lovely things for sale.

145
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,369
- Our card, sir.
- Thank you.

146
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,445
I'll be back Thursday.

147
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:37,165
Her message reached us too late.

148
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,209
The musical boxes have been sold.

149
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:44,188
Well, let's get out of here.

150
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,415
Some day you'll go too far.

151
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:58,097
Reaching for a star, you fool.

152
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,015
Yet a fool may touch a star,
Colonel Cavanaugh

153
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:03,185
if he reaches high enough.

154
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:05,770
But not possess it as you would.

155
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,982
The musical boxes they've been sold?

156
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:11,981
What a pity for you, my dear Colonel.

157
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:15,560
Is it my fault that the message
reached us only an hour ago?

158
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,149
Is it my fault that they were sold?

159
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:21,108
She can't hold me responsible for that.

160
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:22,883
Hope for your sake you're right.

161
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,964
"They will call upon you tonight
at a quarter till eight,"

162
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,343
a gentleman it is asked to consult you

163
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:02,302
"upon a matter of the
very deepest moment."

164
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,131
Remember that letter, Holmes?

165
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:06,550
It was written over two years ago.

166
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:07,970
Very interesting case.

167
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:09,969
Devilishly interesting.

168
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,388
Humph, Irene Adler,

169
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,848
what a striking looking woman

170
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,517
from the brief glance I had of her.

171
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,306
Seems only yesterday.

172
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:19,186
What charm.

173
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,985
What poise. And what a mind.

174
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:23,274
Sharp enough and brilliant enough

175
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,522
to outwit the great
Sherlock Holmes himself.

176
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:30,032
I take it that the new issue
of the Strand Magazine is out,

177
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,820
containing another of
your slightly lurid tales.

178
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:33,900
It is indeed.

179
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,659
And what do you call this one?

180
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:39,448
I call it "A Scandal in Bohemia".
Not a bad title, huh?

181
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:43,706
Hmm. If you must
record my exploits

182
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,665
I do wish you would put less
emphasis on the melodramatic

183
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:49,204
and more on the intellectual
issues involved.

184
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,543
More on the inte... what
do you mean by that?

185
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:56,212
Well, I do hope you've given
The Woman a soul,

186
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:57,381
she had one you know?

187
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:59,170
By The Woman,

188
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:01,090
I suppose you mean Irene Adler?

189
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:03,169
Yes,

190
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,773
I shall always remember her as The woman.

191
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,989
Come in.

192
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:22,811
Stinky.

193
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,351
Fatso, old boy, how are you?

194
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,480
How are you, old boy?
I haven't seen you for years.

195
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,519
I want you to meet my old
friend Sherlock Holmes.

196
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,149
Holmes, this is Stinky.

197
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,478
In other words Julian Emery.

198
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,947
How do you do, Mr. Emery?
Watson's often spoken of you.

199
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,316
Oh, has he?

200
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,696
Yes, we were at school together.

201
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,275
Yes, more years ago
than I care to remember

202
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:41,534
but you didn't come in here
just to remind me of that.

203
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,194
No, I just happened to
be in the neighborhood

204
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,613
and saw your lights burning

205
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,822
so I took the liberty of looking you up.

206
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:48,492
Still writing the old mystery stuff?

207
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,991
Yes. There's a new
one out this week.

208
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,330
- Good, I never miss them.
- Oh good. Thanks.

209
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:56,119
I say that bandage makes
you look very interesting.

210
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:58,998
Still poking your nose into other
people's business as usual?

211
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,247
- Who hit you?
- I haven't the foggiest notion.

212
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:03,296
Somebody knocked me on the
head in my own living room

213
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,294
then proceeded to commit the most
idiotic burglary you ever heard of.

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,884
Fellow must have been barney as a coot.

215
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,713
Barney, why?

216
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,133
Come sit down, old boy.

217
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,972
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Huh?

218
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,471
Oh, all right.

219
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:18,566
I'll go and tell
Mrs. Hudson about it.

220
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,968
Why did you say the robbery
was idiotic, Mr. Emery?

221
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:25,597
Oh, simply from the fact that

222
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:27,097
with about five thousand pounds worth

223
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:28,806
of musical boxes in my living room

224
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:30,726
the thief, who I caught in the act,

225
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,395
made off with one that isn't
even worth five pounds.

226
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,684
I gather you are a
collector of musical boxes?

227
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,023
Yes, I am indeed.

228
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,193
Some of them are very beautiful

229
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:40,062
but not the one that was stolen.

230
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:42,691
This thief evidently grabbed the
first thing that came to his hand

231
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,030
when he heard me coming into the room.

232
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:47,859
Still it's rather odd, isn't it,
that having disposed of you

233
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:50,698
he didn't pick up something more valuable.

234
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:52,987
Well, is there anything
unusual about the stolen box?

235
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,996
No, nothing at all.

236
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,575
I picked it up in the south of France

237
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,165
several years ago.

238
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:01,874
You say you have many valuable music boxes

239
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,873
and yet the thief made off with one
that's isn't worth five pounds.

240
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:07,252
Sounds like a rather
intriguing little problem.

241
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,881
Yes, well I take it that he was
just an ordinary petty thief

242
00:12:09,947 --> 00:12:11,380
and didn't know the value.

243
00:12:11,446 --> 00:12:14,209
That is a possible explanation,
yet I adventure to say

244
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,088
that the average petty thief has a
more extensive knowledge of the value

245
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,177
of the object d'art than
the average collector.

246
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,426
Well anyway, that's Scotland Yards theory

247
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,256
they didn't get very excited about it.

248
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,465
That's consistent anyway.

249
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:27,924
I wonder if I might see
your collection, Mr. Emery?

250
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,803
Why of course you can. Yes.

251
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,182
Nothing that a collector likes more

252
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,932
than showing off his trophies.

253
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:35,681
- When would it suit you?
- No time like the present.

254
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:36,930
Good.

255
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,440
My place is just around in Pullman Square.

256
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:40,285
- Shall we?
- Yes, right.

257
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,027
Hello. Where you going?

258
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,396
- Stinky hasn't had his tea yet.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

259
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:49,985
We're going round to my place

260
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:53,020
where I'm going to give you
something better than tea.

261
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,783
Now this one was made for Louis the XV

262
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:59,532
and is one of the very few still
in the existence from that period

263
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:01,797
and a particularly fine specimen at that.

264
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,699
Charming isn't it?

265
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,464
Quite.

266
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:11,167
They all sound to me like a lot of mice

267
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,336
running about on a tin roof.

268
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:15,666
I'm afraid you have no ear
for music, Watson.

269
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:18,205
Give me a good old band
playing a rousing march,

270
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:20,640
you have all your silly
little tweet tweets.

271
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,926
Oh, that's another one of them.

272
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:33,055
Good gracious me.

273
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,820
Stupid thing, singing rabbit, huh.

274
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,563
What would you say offhand is the
value of a box like that, Mr. Emery?

275
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,442
Well, it's hard to say offhand
but I think it would bring

276
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,611
about five or six hundred pounds today.

277
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:55,230
It's the gem of my collection.

278
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,570
Yet a thief, who steals an
oddity like a musical box,

279
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,489
passes up one worth five hundred pounds

280
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:01,948
for one of almost no value at all.

281
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:04,867
Odd, very odd.

282
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,786
What was the stolen box like,
Mr. Emery?

283
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:10,745
Oh, just plain wooden box about so big.

284
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:14,783
As a matter fact, I have one over
here almost exactly like it.

285
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:18,122
I picked this up yesterday at an
auction room in Knightsbridge,

286
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,001
paid only two pounds for it.

287
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,750
Of course, I wouldn't have ordinarily

288
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:25,879
add one like this to my collection
but the tune intrigued me.

289
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:29,244
I'd never heard it before.

290
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,471
You have a remarkable
ear for music, Holmes.

291
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:49,680
- Rather an unusual melody.
- Sit down, will you.

292
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:52,099
Thanks.

293
00:14:52,165 --> 00:14:55,108
You say you bought that box
at an auction hall yesterday?

294
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:58,526
Yes. The Gaylord Auction
Rooms in Knightsbridge,

295
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,526
run by old... What's his name?

296
00:15:00,592 --> 00:15:01,815
Crabtree.

297
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,025
That's the man.

298
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:04,564
At what time was the robbery committed?

299
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,323
Oh, about three o'clock this morning.

300
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,822
You know, Mr. Emery

301
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,571
that box and the robbery
might well be cause and effect,

302
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:13,861
especially since you say
that the stolen box

303
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:16,410
outwardly resembles this one a great deal

304
00:15:16,476 --> 00:15:20,078
and Scotland Yard was not
particularly interested, eh?

305
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:22,497
Oh yes, but I wouldn't
blame them for that,

306
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,326
especially as I told them I was
quite unable to describe the thief,

307
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,545
except, of course, for the fact
that it was definitely a man.

308
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,744
All you remember is that who came in here

309
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,794
and someone struck you on the head.

310
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,623
Yes and the next thing I knew

311
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,583
my man was trying to revive me.

312
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,752
It might be wise for you to put that
box away somewhere and lock it up.

313
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,501
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.

314
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,340
Besides, everything's insured.

315
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,379
Well, at least of any further
attempts at robbery are made

316
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:45,678
I'd suggest that you call the police

317
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,428
rather than running into
any personal danger.

318
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:49,847
Oh come, Holmes aren't you
being a bit of an alarmist?

319
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:50,886
Possibly.

320
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,726
I must agree with old Stinky.

321
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,265
Seems to me you are making rather
a mountain out of a mole skin.

322
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:56,724
Molehill is the word, old boy

323
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,813
and it's time you were in bed.

324
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,603
Thanks so much for letting
us see your collection.

325
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,638
It's been grand meeting you.

326
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,190
Holmes, I can't understand
why you were so mysterious.

327
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:10,109
Seems to me the petty thief explanation
was the only sensible one.

328
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:11,818
- Really?
- Yes, I can't see how you can believe

329
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,148
it was anything else.

330
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:14,697
I didn't say I believed
it to be anything else.

331
00:16:14,763 --> 00:16:17,366
The petty thief theory is
the obvious one I grant you.

332
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:19,985
However, it's often a mistaken
to accept something that's true

333
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,244
merely because it's obvious.

334
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,404
The truth is only arrived at

335
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,452
by the pain staking process
of eliminating the untrue.

336
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:30,581
We are not able to do that in this case

337
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,001
without further data.

338
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,790
Rubbish. You're pulling my leg.

339
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:35,539
You're trying to turn a

340
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,668
cut on the head and a robbery
into an international plot.

341
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:39,748
No I'm not.

342
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:41,127
I just hope that your friend Stinky

343
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:43,087
is a little more cautious in the future,

344
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:44,852
just in case.

345
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,685
Hello. Yeah.

346
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,395
Julian Emery here.

347
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,773
Who?

348
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,233
Why of course I remember
you, Mrs. Courtney.

349
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,862
Yes. Yes, you are the
one bright spot

350
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:25,780
at that appallingly dull
affair of Lady Sanfords.

351
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:27,030
Huh?

352
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,369
Of course it isn't to late to come around.

353
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,908
Yes, I shall be delighted
to give you a drink.

354
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,447
I tell you what come straight up

355
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:37,206
and I'll leave the door unlatched.

356
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:39,285
All right. Fifteen minutes?

357
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,084
Good.

358
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,294
I shall be counting each moment.

359
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,922
No. No. No, I mean that, really.

360
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,678
Right. Goodbye.

361
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:08,434
Boo!

362
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,053
Oh, you startled me.

363
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,763
- Did I?
- Yes.

364
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,852
Must be the pixie in me.

365
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,981
I know I shouldn't have called you so late

366
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,350
but I was at a party
just around the corner

367
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,690
and I remembered your invitation

368
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,649
to see your collection of musical boxes.

369
00:18:21,715 --> 00:18:23,268
My dear, Mrs. Courtney,

370
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,317
pleasure is all the greater
for being so unexpected.

371
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:28,696
- My friends call me Hilda.
- Thanks.

372
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:30,366
Mine call me Stinky.

373
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:32,115
Stinky? How quaint.

374
00:18:32,181 --> 00:18:35,324
Oh, what a perfectly wonderful
collection of musical boxes.

375
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,743
You know, when you told
me you had a collection

376
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,532
- I had no idea that it was so attractive.
- Yes.

377
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:41,661
They appeal to the ear

378
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,290
as well as to the eye.

379
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,829
Oh, what a plain little one.

380
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:49,708
Why it looks just like a country
cousin Amid all this grandeur.

381
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,877
Now, now, now you mustn't
underestimate the country cousin.

382
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,916
Only last night a burglar broke in here

383
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:56,456
and with all these to chose from

384
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:58,165
- went off with one very much like it.
- Really?

385
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,544
Yes, I don't mind the loss the box so much

386
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,383
but I do resent this crack on the skull.

387
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,923
But it makes you look so interesting.

388
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:05,962
- Do you think so?
- Uh-huh.

389
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:07,971
- That's funny, that's what old fatso said.
- Fatso?

390
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:09,841
I mean Doctor Watson.

391
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:13,099
He was here this evening
with a friend, a Mr. Holmes.

392
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:14,889
He's interested in my collection too.

393
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,178
Sherlock Holmes?

394
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:17,678
Yes. Do you know him?

395
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:19,307
I've heard of him.

396
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:23,266
Yes, he seems to think
I'm in some sort of danger.

397
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,394
What a haunting tune. It takes
me right back to my childhood.

398
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,563
Really?

399
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,273
You know it's odd that you should be
interested in that particular musical box.

400
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,772
Odd, why?
Cause Mr. Holmes is also interested in it.

401
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:36,820
He may have been more interested
in the tune than in the box.

402
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,490
My dear, yes, that's right.

403
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,029
I remember now.

404
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,278
He whistled it note for note
having heard it only once.

405
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:45,537
Really? He must be
a remarkable man.

406
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,746
Bit of an alarmist if you ask me.

407
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,326
Don't you believe in warnings?

408
00:19:49,392 --> 00:19:50,785
Of course not.

409
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,784
Who'd want a box like that?

410
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,954
I would.

411
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,543
You're not serious?

412
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:57,203
Oh, but I am.

413
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,712
Well, you put me at a
very awkward position.

414
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:01,331
I'm a collector you know

415
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,630
and a collector buys but never sells.

416
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:07,419
But if the price were high enough.

417
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,258
The price has nothing to do with it.

418
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:12,837
It's the principle of the thing.

419
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:15,466
Yes, well we haven't had our drink.

420
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:19,054
No thanks, I must be getting along.

421
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,329
- Must you really?
- I'm afraid so.

422
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:25,722
You're not walking out on me are you?

423
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:30,140
My reputation, Stinky.

424
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,939
I say, you know you are
an attractive woman.

425
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:34,244
Thanks.

426
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:44,065
You fool.
I told you to wait outside.

427
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,324
What did you have to kill him for?

428
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,113
All I had to do was walk out with this.

429
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,952
- He held you in his arms.
- Don't touch him.

430
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,621
Don't touch anything.
Now get out!

431
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,280
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

432
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:59,249
What about me? This is murder.

433
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:01,078
What about Scotland Yard?

434
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:03,497
What about Sherlock Holmes?

435
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,672
Now get out!

436
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:34,482
Did you get it?

437
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,684
Good.

438
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,733
Did you have any trouble with him?

439
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,908
Just a matter of murder.

440
00:21:46,677 --> 00:21:48,900
- Ah, Mr. Holmes.
- Hopkins.

441
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,489
Thanks for coming so promptly.

442
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:53,568
Inspector Lestrade suggested
that I call through to you.

443
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:56,987
Mr. Emery was a client of
Mr. Holmes, Inspector. Indeed.

444
00:21:57,053 --> 00:21:58,986
You didn't mention that when
I telephoned you, Mr. Holmes.

445
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,995
Well not exactly a client, Inspector.

446
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,664
- Sergeant Thompson?
- He was killed between the hours of eleven

447
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,569
and two o'clock this
morning, Mr. Holmes.

448
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,452
Must have been someone he knew.

449
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:12,251
Someone of whom he had no suspicion.

450
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:14,000
Poor old Stinky.

451
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,669
It's all my fault.
I should have prevented this.

452
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,258
Well, it's no time to start
talking about that now, Doctor.

453
00:22:20,324 --> 00:22:22,047
Apparently, it's gone.

454
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:24,047
That's the second attempt
on the musical box

455
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,836
that Emery bought at the auction sale

456
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:27,635
and this time it was successful.

457
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:29,425
But that box is only worth two pounds.

458
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:31,674
It's worth a man's life, Watson.

459
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,473
I think we'd better
pay a visit to Gaylord's

460
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,092
Auction Room and that fellow Crabtree.

461
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:36,472
Inspector may I suggest

462
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,261
that you make a complete
search of this flat

463
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:41,980
for a small plain musical
box about that size.

464
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:44,015
Thank you. Come on, Watson.

465
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:48,357
You say the first box
went to Mr. Julian Emery,

466
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:51,686
the second, Mr. Kilgour,
143B Hampton Way,

467
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:53,565
and the third to the
unidentified young lady

468
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,815
who presumably has a shop
and lives near Golders Green?

469
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:57,154
That's right Mr. Holmes.

470
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,573
Isn't it rather strange,
Mr. Crabtree,

471
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,692
that you've had three identical musical
boxes, all playing the same tune?

472
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,611
- Where did they come from?
- Dartmoor Prison.

473
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:07,700
Dartmoor? We get a regular
shipment from there every month.

474
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:09,079
The inmates manufacture them.

475
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,409
Well, they make all kinds
of things you know?

476
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,078
Pipe racks, wastepaper baskets,

477
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:14,537
- musical boxes.
- Did you happen to notice

478
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,666
if anyone showed any particular
interest during the auction

479
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:21,625
in the purchases of these three boxes?

480
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,374
Oh, come now, Mr. Crabtree,

481
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,793
this is very literally a
matter of life and death.

482
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,172
Well, since you put it
that way, Mr. Holmes,

483
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:30,461
there was a gentleman came in here
about an hour after closing time.

484
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:34,420
And he was in an awful state, he was,

485
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:36,509
he gave me five pounds to tell
him where the boxes had gone.

486
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:38,508
He said they had sentimental
value for him, sir.

487
00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:40,388
Expensive sentiment.

488
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:41,637
Can you describe him?

489
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:43,176
Well he was tall, distinguished looking

490
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:45,096
and he had gray hair and a mustache.

491
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:46,385
He was quite a gentleman, sir.

492
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:47,935
And what was his reaction

493
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:49,724
when you were unable to supply him

494
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,603
with the address of the young
lady who owned the shop?

495
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:54,102
I told him that the young lady
usually come back on Thursday.

496
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,811
He said he'd come back on
Thursday and that's tomorrow.

497
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:59,560
Thank you Mr. Crabtree, you've
been very helpful. Thank you.

498
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,150
Come along, Watson.

499
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:03,359
- Where we going now, Holmes?
- The home of Mr. Kilgour,

500
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:05,214
the man who bought the third box.

501
00:24:11,472 --> 00:24:13,325
But hang it all, Holmes,

502
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:15,404
how do you know those other two
musical boxes are of any importance?

503
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,904
I don't, but I certainly have no intention

504
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,779
of waiting till the owners
are murdered to find out.

505
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:23,081
No one at home.

506
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:25,370
I hope that's the explanation.

507
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:27,596
Well, have a look through this window.

508
00:24:32,774 --> 00:24:35,796
Doesn't seem to be anyone there.

509
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:39,675
Whole place seems deserted
as far as I can see.

510
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,214
- Yes?
- Mr. and Mrs. Kilgour at home?

511
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,843
- No.
- When do you expect them?

512
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:45,843
Oh, in an hour or so.

513
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,512
There's no use you're hanging about.

514
00:24:47,578 --> 00:24:49,141
They don't buy nothing from peddlers.

515
00:24:49,207 --> 00:24:50,431
Peddlers?

516
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,470
My good woman this is
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

517
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,429
Sherlock Holmes? Oh, go on.

518
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,479
Do you mind if we come in and wait?

519
00:24:56,545 --> 00:24:57,848
My business is rather urgent.

520
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:00,807
Well, I've got to go out to do my shopping

521
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:02,436
and I don't know if Mrs. Kilgour

522
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,436
would like any strangers nosing about.

523
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,025
Quite all right, I assure you.

524
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:07,524
Well, I've got to be off.

525
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,023
You two wait in the parlor
and no smoking either.

526
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:15,991
Mrs. Kilgour says it
smells up the house.

527
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,616
- Funny old girl, Holmes.
- Hmm.

528
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:38,043
- Park Lane.
- Park Lane?

529
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,212
And what would the likes of
you be doing in Park Lane?

530
00:25:40,278 --> 00:25:42,171
Now don't worry about the fare, ducky.

531
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:45,266
If ya knows how to get
to Park Lane, now off it.

532
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:52,427
You know, Holmes, I've been thinking.

533
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:53,507
There must have been something hidden

534
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:56,266
in that box of old Stinky's.

535
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:59,634
Stolen jewelry possibly.

536
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,090
- What's up Holmes?
- Listen.

537
00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:06,958
Well, it's just the steam
in the water pipes.

538
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,125
Watson!

539
00:26:16,294 --> 00:26:17,904
Great Scott!

540
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:21,772
Come along, Holmes,
get her on the chair here.

541
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,301
Shh. It's all right, my dear.

542
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,573
There, there, there.
Now don't worry.

543
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,572
It's all over.

544
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,871
There you are, dear.
Don't cry anymore.

545
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:36,660
She tied me up and
shut me in the cupboard.

546
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,500
I know, I know.

547
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,419
She won't come back.

548
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:42,538
Did you show her your new musical box?

549
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:45,167
Yes. She said she
wanted to hear it play

550
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,858
and as soon as I showed it
to her she grabbed a hold...

551
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:48,916
I know. I know now.

552
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,175
Now don't worry, we'll buy
you a new musical box.

553
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,424
Yes, my dear, the best one in London.

554
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,593
Watson.

555
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,762
Oh, what a fool, what a fool I've been.

556
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,092
What do you mean, Holmes?

557
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:00,301
She took the musical box out of this house

558
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:01,881
in that market basket

559
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:03,640
right under our very noses.

560
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:06,809
Why would the Kilgour charwoman
want to take the music box?

561
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,388
She isn't the Kilgour charwoman

562
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:10,268
she's a consummate actress.

563
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,687
An extremely clever, unscrupulous
woman who will stop at nothing.

564
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:14,056
Take care of the child,
will you, old fellow,

565
00:27:14,122 --> 00:27:15,815
till her parents get back.

566
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:18,105
- Explain everything to them.
- Of course I will.

567
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:19,984
But Holmes, where are you going?

568
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,773
Somewhere, somehow

569
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,112
I must get to the young lady who
bought that third musical box

570
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,822
before our opponents find her.

571
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:28,317
I only hope that I won't be too late.

572
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,867
Now, now, now, darling
you mustn't cry anymore.

573
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,197
Cheer up.

574
00:27:38,263 --> 00:27:40,366
Would you... would you
like to hear old uncle

575
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:42,861
make a noise like a duck?

576
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:54,107
Oh, sorry. Huh.

577
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:21,021
Now, ladies and gentlemen
how much am I offered

578
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:25,149
for this beautiful laced
Dresden china figurine?

579
00:28:25,215 --> 00:28:27,018
A lady of the French court.

580
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:30,227
Now this is the genuine article.

581
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,316
What a beautiful ornament
for your mantelpiece

582
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:34,985
as a centerpiece on the dining room table.

583
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:37,065
Now will somebody start me for ten pounds?

584
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,074
Will somebody start me for ten pounds?

585
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,823
Eight pounds?

586
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,283
Seven pounds?

587
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:43,612
All right five.

588
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:44,572
Five pounds is offered.
Five pounds is offered.

589
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:45,621
Five pounds is offered.

590
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:46,911
Five pounds ten.

591
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:50,329
Five pounds fifteen, five pounds fifteen.

592
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,289
Six pounds is offered.
Six pounds, six pounds,

593
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,998
going once, going twice,

594
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,787
the third and the last call
we're all done.

595
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,372
Sold to the lady from
Trikland for six pounds.

596
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:03,544
Next we have a real museum
piece ladies and gentlemen.

597
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,173
A fine nineteenth century doll.

598
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,922
The costume, an exact replica
of the holiday clothes worn

599
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:11,092
by the Hungarian peasant women.

600
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:13,261
Now ladies and gentlemen,

601
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:16,340
an article like this would cost him fifteen
to twenty pounds in a west end shop.

602
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,219
I'm not going to ask
for anything like that.

603
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:19,638
Who will give me two pounds for it?

604
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:21,218
Two pounds, anybody offer me two pounds?

605
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:23,347
Two pounds, for the Hungarian, two...

606
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:24,436
One pound?

607
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:25,686
Will anybody give me one pound?

608
00:29:25,752 --> 00:29:27,605
Anybody offer me one pound for the doll?

609
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:30,264
One pound is offered, ladies and gentlemen.
One pound is offered.

610
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,273
Now I'm not going to waste
your valuable time or mine

611
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,062
in trying to get one half of what
this beautiful doll is worth.

612
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,521
If the young lady can steal it for
one pound that's her good fortune.

613
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:41,230
So, it's going once, it's going twice,

614
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,819
the third and last call, anymore?

615
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:46,778
Sold to the young lady for one pound.

616
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:48,817
Now, ladies and gentlemen
may I draw your attention

617
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:50,786
to something, which may be,
a great surprise to you,

618
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:52,576
worthy of any collection.

619
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:55,495
The only other one like it
is in the British museum.

620
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,623
It's a Ming vase of the seventh dynasty.

621
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:01,702
This vase lay in a large collection

622
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:04,751
somewhere outside Rome for over
two centuries I understand.

623
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:06,171
It was just discovered there

624
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,500
by the noted antiquarian
Sir Andrew Copperstone.

625
00:30:08,566 --> 00:30:10,799
Now, some of you may remember
Sir Andrew Copperstone.

626
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:12,668
Besides being a world traveled antiquarian

627
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,933
he's also a gentleman writer.

628
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:22,384
The girl with the parcel
in her hands, that's her.

629
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,134
Are you sure that's the girl?

630
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,093
She fits perfectly the
auctioneer's description.

631
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,228
Follow her, Hamid.

632
00:31:05,894 --> 00:31:07,537
It's lovely, dear.

633
00:31:07,603 --> 00:31:08,957
And only one pound.

634
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:10,496
We can get at least three for it.

635
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:12,995
Easily. I'll go make some tea.

636
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:14,990
- I could do with a cup.
- Right.

637
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:21,252
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

638
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:22,671
I'm looking for a birthday gift

639
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:24,921
for a seven-year-old girl.
What would you suggest?

640
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,590
We have some lovely dolls.

641
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:29,259
- Now this Hungarian...
- I think she has enough dolls already.

642
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:30,798
Books are always welcome.

643
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:33,007
Well, I'm looking for
something a little different.

644
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:35,517
Well, that's rather cute, what is it?

645
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,266
Oh, that's a musical box.

646
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,265
Children always love them

647
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:42,224
and this is an exceptionally nice one.

648
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,709
It plays many tunes.

649
00:31:50,297 --> 00:31:52,060
- Have you any others?
- Yes.

650
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:53,940
If you'll just step this way.

651
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:55,885
I have only two left.

652
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:01,683
How nice.

653
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:08,034
Are you sure this is all you have?

654
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,244
I'm sorry

655
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,073
they're rather hard to find, you know.

656
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:12,992
That's our entire allotment.

657
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,121
I did have one other but I sold
it earlier this afternoon.

658
00:32:16,187 --> 00:32:17,620
But it was only a plain wooden one.

659
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,790
It wouldn't have been a
very nice gift for a child.

660
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,499
Really?

661
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,588
Do you happen to know
who the purchaser was?

662
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:27,167
Why yes, he left his card

663
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:30,312
just in case anyone
should inquire for him.

664
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,529
How interesting.

665
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:43,391
I'm sorry but I'm afraid I'll
have to look a bit further.

666
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:45,930
Thank you anyway.

667
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:48,335
Good afternoon. Thank you.

668
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:14,455
Cabbie.

669
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,577
- Follow that cab.
- Here now, what?

670
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:22,122
- Scotland Yard.
- Hop in.

671
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:32,422
Sherlock Holmes, I might have known.

672
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:35,131
We thought we were the hunters

673
00:33:35,197 --> 00:33:37,300
instead of which we're the hunted.

674
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:40,839
We've been fooled. We played
right into his hands.

675
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:44,387
Of course, he's had us followed.

676
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:46,387
Don't look.

677
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:49,202
The man in front of the toyshop.

678
00:33:50,951 --> 00:33:55,489
Hamid, turn sharp right at the
next corner and again at the next.

679
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:03,730
No photograph of her, commissioner,

680
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:05,060
as I expected.

681
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,729
She's not a known criminal.

682
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,898
But how are you expect to
know her if you do find her?

683
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,487
After all she was disguised
as a charwoman.

684
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,275
Don't worry, old fellow

685
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,485
If I ever see her again
I'll recognize her.

686
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,905
Well, it won't be long till
we know who they are

687
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:19,494
and from where they operate.

688
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,824
Who's covering them?

689
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,572
Sergeant Thompson is following them, sir.

690
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,661
They won't get away from
him, he's a good man.

691
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,741
He could have arrested them at Kibbutz's
Toy Shop if we had any proof.

692
00:34:27,806 --> 00:34:30,040
But we know that they killed Emery.

693
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:32,895
Proof, my dear fellow, we must have proof.

694
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:37,337
We have x-rayed it, sir. There's
nothing whatever concealed in the box.

695
00:34:37,402 --> 00:34:39,552
We'll have a look at the plates.

696
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,592
There must be some clue

697
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:52,382
and it's probably so obvious
that we've all overlooked it.

698
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:55,246
Seems to me were up against
a bunch of lunatics.

699
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:59,059
Not lunatics, my dear fellow,

700
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,228
extremely astute, cold-blooded murderers.

701
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:02,938
Well, what can these little musical boxes

702
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:04,767
have in them that's so important?

703
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,186
Don't forget they were
made in Dartmoor Prison.

704
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,975
Why you can smuggle stuff
into prison but not out.

705
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,894
Do you want us to break
the box apart, sir,

706
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,193
to see if there's anything
the x-ray hasn't caught?

707
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,403
No, not yet.

708
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:16,442
Do you mind if I take it?

709
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:18,208
- Certainly.
- Thanks.

710
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:30,037
The governor of Dartmoor
Prison informed us, sir,

711
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:32,366
in answer to
Mr. Holmes' question

712
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:35,285
that all three musical boxes
were made by the same convict,

713
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:37,954
John Davidson, serving a 7-year term, sir.

714
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,793
- Davidson?
- The Bank of England plates.

715
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,549
- That will be all.
- Yes, sir.

716
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:44,502
Now were getting somewhere.

717
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:46,001
Wait a minute

718
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,040
how did you know about
the plates, Mr. Holmes?

719
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm a student of crime, Inspector.

720
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:52,089
I make my business to
know about such things

721
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:54,088
and when the name of
Davidson was mentioned.

722
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,887
Well, who is this fellow Davidson?

723
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,426
As long as Mr. Holmes seems
to know all about it already

724
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:02,595
I suppose there's no harm in telling you.

725
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,514
Two years ago in London

726
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,513
there occurred a robbery
of such tremendous importance,

727
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:09,392
although the stolen articles themselves

728
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,391
have no intrinsic value whatsoever,

729
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:13,021
but the home secretary was instrumental

730
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,810
in seeing that not word of it
appeared in any newspaper.

731
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,979
But you never told me
anything about this, Holmes.

732
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:20,778
You were away at the time.

733
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:24,486
Articles of no intrinsic value
and yet of such importance.

734
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:25,986
I don't understand.

735
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:27,405
When Davidson was apprehended

736
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:29,824
within fifteen minutes
of committing the theft

737
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,743
but by that time he'd hidden
the articles in question

738
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,493
and they've yet to be found.

739
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,702
Before going further, Doctor Watson,

740
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:39,581
I must inform you that this matter is not
to be mentioned outside of this room.

741
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,620
Of course not. Do I look
like a man who'd gossip?

742
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:45,458
Let's not go into that now,
old fellow, shall we?

743
00:36:45,524 --> 00:36:47,918
Davidson had been employed for years

744
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:50,037
in a position of extreme trust

745
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:52,046
by the engravings department
of the Bank of England.

746
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:54,625
The articles he stole were nothing less

747
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,794
than a complete duplicate set of plates

748
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,463
- for printing five-pound notes.
- What?

749
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:02,712
- The Bank of England's own plates?
- Precisely.

750
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,471
And with those plates a gang
of crooks could flood England

751
00:37:05,537 --> 00:37:06,800
with five-pound notes,

752
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,049
not forged in the usual sense of the word

753
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:11,968
but notes undetectable from
genuine Bank of England notes

754
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:14,347
- in any way whatsoever.
- Good heavens.

755
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:17,726
Any whisper at all might have
resulted in enormous damage

756
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,685
in shaking public confidence
in the treasury.

757
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,264
We tried everything after
we arrested Davidson.

758
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,604
Offered him a shorter sentence

759
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,023
if he'd tell us where
he'd hidden the plates.

760
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:27,562
Why we even put in Scotland Yard men

761
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:30,441
with him as cell mates but no results.

762
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:32,980
Obviously, Davidson is a
man of strong character

763
00:37:33,046 --> 00:37:35,279
and infinite patience.

764
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:38,238
Yet suddenly he feels impelled
to smuggle out the secret

765
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:40,737
of the hiding place of the
plates to his confederates.

766
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:42,117
Why?

767
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,576
I don't understand, Mr. Holmes.

768
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,575
Well, for example,

769
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,454
has the Bank of England made any plans

770
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,123
to radically change the
design of the five pound note

771
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:53,992
so that, say uh, seven years from now

772
00:37:54,058 --> 00:37:56,711
notes made from the stolen
plates would be worthless?

773
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:59,920
Confidentially, Mr. Holmes,
such a move was discussed

774
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,209
but replacing all the five
pound notes in circulation

775
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:03,839
would be such a herculean task

776
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:06,258
that nothing's been done about it as yet.

777
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:07,677
I see.

778
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,926
Of course there is another
possible explanation.

779
00:38:09,992 --> 00:38:11,386
Davidson didn't have much time

780
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,595
to find a hiding place
before he was captured.

781
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:15,514
He may be afraid

782
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,553
that the plates will be accidentally
discovered before he's released,

783
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,472
hence his anxiety to
communicate their whereabouts

784
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:24,971
to his confederates as soon as possible.

785
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,270
I believe you hit it,
Mr. Holmes.

786
00:38:27,336 --> 00:38:32,438
I'm sure that the message is
contained in this musical box,

787
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:34,727
or rather in all three musical boxes

788
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:38,146
since possession of all
three seems to be essential.

789
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:41,274
Our opponents have two thirds of the
puzzle, only we have one third.

790
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,573
Well, what are you going to do, Holmes?

791
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:48,907
Try to deduce the message from
the one third that we have.

792
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:31,975
It's the same tune as the one
played by Emery's musical box.

793
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,895
And yet it's different.

794
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,475
Sounds the same to me.

795
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:38,606
The tune.

796
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:43,986
Somehow the tune
is the key to the mystery.

797
00:39:44,052 --> 00:39:46,077
It must be the tune.

798
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:50,037
Otherwise, why use three musical
boxes to convey the message?

799
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:52,023
Why not collar boxes or shoe boxes?

800
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:55,668
Yes?

801
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:59,668
- Oh, it's for you, Inspector.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

802
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:03,009
Inspector Hopkins speaking.

803
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:04,495
What?

804
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,285
Where?

805
00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:09,810
Goldess Green Station reports

806
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:12,270
they've just found
Sergeant Thompson's body.

807
00:40:12,336 --> 00:40:13,650
From the tire marks on his clothes

808
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:16,570
he was apparently run over by a taxi.

809
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:18,781
What an unfortunate accident.

810
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:21,821
Not an accident, my dear fellow.

811
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,767
I'm afraid it's murder.

00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:10,302
Well, I wouldn't want to
take it on myself, sir,

869
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:12,592
but I'd get somebody to
do it for you far for that.

870
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:14,222
You don't know what the job is yet.

871
00:43:14,288 --> 00:43:16,932
For five pounds?
Murder ain't it?

872
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:17,983
What?

873
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:20,483
No Joe, not murder just music.

874
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:22,273
I want you to identify a song for me.

875
00:43:22,339 --> 00:43:24,483
Oh, there ain't a song that's
been written that I don't know.

876
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:26,234
That's why I came to you.

877
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,994
Of course, the violin is
more my instrument but,

878
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,620
oh well, here we go.
Now listen to this Joe.

879
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:40,755
Wait a minute, you're playing that wrong.

880
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:43,256
That should be 'E' natural not 'E' flat.

881
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:44,418
You know the song?

882
00:43:44,484 --> 00:43:47,216
Oh yes, it's an old
Australian song called...

883
00:43:47,282 --> 00:43:49,636
'The Swag Man' but you're
playing it all wrong.

884
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:50,677
That's what I'd hoped you say.

885
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:52,263
Now listen again, Joe.

886
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:00,528
That's the same tune all right

887
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:02,988
but you're making different mistakes
than you did the first time.

888
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,988
No, not mistakes, Joe.
Call them variations.

889
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:08,305
Here, play the song for me,
will you, the way it's written.

890
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,682
- There you are.
- Thank you, Joe.

891
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:34,312
What's it mean, Holmes?

892
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:35,652
You on to something?

893
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:37,152
Perhaps.

894
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:38,942
I don't know yet.

895
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:41,743
It's probably a code of some sort.

896
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:44,453
Joe?

897
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,783
Could you write the song down for me

898
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:48,244
the way it was originally written?

899
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,204
Oh sure, Mr. Holmes
but it'll take a few minutes.

900
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:52,970
Here, Mabel.

901
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,491
Pale ale. Come on,
hop to it, on with it.

902
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:11,726
Well, obviously it isn't the lyrics.

903
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,147
No combination of those words

904
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:14,607
made any sense at all.

905
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,197
The variations in the way

906
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:17,697
Emery's musical box played the tune

907
00:45:17,763 --> 00:45:19,907
are different from the
variations of the one we have.

908
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:21,238
- You sure?
- Quite.

909
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,948
You see, I took the trouble to memorize

910
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,078
the tune as played by Emery's box

911
00:45:25,144 --> 00:45:26,618
that night we were with him in his flat.

912
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:27,998
Holmes, you amaze me.

913
00:45:28,064 --> 00:45:29,289
Elementary, my dear fellow,

914
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:31,799
one of the first principles
in solving crime

915
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:34,209
is never to disregard anything
no matter how trivial.

916
00:45:34,275 --> 00:45:36,839
But why the three boxes?
Why not one?

917
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:39,220
Because the message was obviously too long

918
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:42,140
to be conveyed by any one variation.

919
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,180
Then there's the third box,

920
00:45:44,246 --> 00:45:46,731
the one that woman took from the Kilgours,

921
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:49,561
that contains yet
another set of variations.

922
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:52,481
Yes, though it's all beyond me.

923
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:54,072
Well, all we have to do now

924
00:45:54,138 --> 00:45:56,032
is to find the secret of the variations,

925
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:58,738
not a very easy problem
to solve, my dear fellow.

926
00:46:03,149 --> 00:46:04,453
Hello.

927
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,269
What's up?

928
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:10,390
We've had company.

929
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,311
I say this is outrageous.

930
00:46:20,331 --> 00:46:22,265
Ask Mrs. Hudson to
come in here will you?

931
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:23,941
Right.

932
00:46:28,262 --> 00:46:29,912
Mrs. Hudson?

933
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:32,776
Yes.

934
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:35,197
Oh, there you are. Will you
come up here at once please?

935
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,963
Oh, coming, sir.

936
00:46:51,785 --> 00:46:55,059
Mercy me, Mr. Holmes,
what has happened?

937
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:57,139
Who called while we
were out, Mrs. Hudson?

938
00:46:57,205 --> 00:46:58,559
Just a young lady,

939
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,690
the one who said you wanted
her to wait for you.

940
00:47:00,756 --> 00:47:02,440
And a nice little old gentlemen with her.

941
00:47:02,506 --> 00:47:04,650
- Our friends again, Watson.
- Friends?

942
00:47:04,716 --> 00:47:06,020
What did the young lady look like?

943
00:47:06,086 --> 00:47:07,901
Oh, I couldn't see her face

944
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:10,821
she had a heavy black veil on

945
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:13,241
but she had such a nice way with her.

946
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:18,502
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes
if I've done anything wrong

947
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:22,332
but you did say I should always let
clients come in and wait for you.

948
00:47:22,398 --> 00:47:23,883
Don't worry, Mrs. Hudson,
don't worry.

949
00:47:23,949 --> 00:47:25,843
You had no way of knowing.

950
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,173
It's quite all right.
Quite all right.

951
00:47:27,239 --> 00:47:29,299
Now don't worry, Mrs. Hudson.

952
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,684
Don't worry?

953
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,354
Well where on earth is the musical box?

954
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,184
They didn't get it.

955
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,644
Didn't get it?

956
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:40,855
Where is it?

957
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,355
- It's in your hand.
- Huh?

958
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:45,261
In that biscuit jar.

959
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,022
Take the biscuits off the top.

960
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:56,457
Now put your hand inside
and you'll find the music box.

961
00:47:56,523 --> 00:48:00,513
Well done, Holmes.
Well done. Amazing.

962
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:23,240
Nice fresh smell.

963
00:48:23,306 --> 00:48:25,596
Like a pub after closing time.

964
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:32,661
I say, Holmes?

965
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:34,371
What?

966
00:48:34,437 --> 00:48:36,121
It's morning.

967
00:48:36,187 --> 00:48:39,548
Allow me to congratulate you on
a brilliant bit of deduction.

968
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,843
It's not a transposition,

969
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:51,183
not a polygraph
transposition, not a trigraph,

970
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:53,563
nor any known form of decoding.

971
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:55,694
How about the Morse code
have you tried that?

972
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,734
Yes, at about three o'clock this morning.

973
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,270
I'm sorry, old man.
I was only trying to help.

974
00:49:16,822 --> 00:49:19,137
Oh, do me a favor, not again.

975
00:49:19,203 --> 00:49:21,257
I must have heard that
thing a thousand times.

976
00:49:21,323 --> 00:49:22,933
Kept me awake all night.

977
00:49:29,874 --> 00:49:32,358
Not a very distinguished
composition I grant you.

978
00:49:32,424 --> 00:49:35,319
You know perfectly well I don't
know one tune from the other.

979
00:49:35,385 --> 00:49:38,489
When I was a kid my people tried
to have me taught the piano.

980
00:49:38,555 --> 00:49:41,239
I always felt sorry for
that old teacher of mine.

981
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:43,030
The poor old girl
finally reached the point

982
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:45,040
of numbering the keys for me.

983
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:46,330
One-two-three-four.

984
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:48,870
Even then I never progressed beyond...

985
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:50,670
Numbering the keys, Watson!

986
00:49:50,736 --> 00:49:53,461
The nineteenth key of the keyboard

987
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,961
is the nineteenth letter of the alphabet.

988
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,921
'S'. Here.

989
00:49:57,987 --> 00:50:01,302
Mark this down while I give it
to you, old fellow, will you?

990
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:04,262
The first altered note, write 'S' first.

991
00:50:04,328 --> 00:50:09,813
Now the eighth key is 'H',

992
00:50:09,879 --> 00:50:13,113
the fifth key 'E',

993
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:16,654
the twelfth key 'L',

994
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,954
the sixth key 'F'.

995
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,664
S-H-E-L-F, shelf.

996
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,995
Your piano lessons were
not in vain, old fellow.

997
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:28,131
You've solved it. Thank you.

998
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,101
Thanks, old bean.

999
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,966
We now have two thirds of a message.

1000
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,846
Behind books,

1001
00:50:36,912 --> 00:50:39,136
third shelf, secretary,

1002
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,097
Doctor 'S'.

1003
00:50:42,163 --> 00:50:44,267
Presumably,

1004
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,107
these are the first and second
portions of the message.

1005
00:50:47,173 --> 00:50:49,898
And this gang has the first
and third parts of it.

1006
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,988
- Precisely.
- Then it's a stalemate?

1007
00:50:52,054 --> 00:50:54,278
Yes commissioner but we
can't leave it like that.

1008
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,488
There's no doubt in my mind
that they'll try to secure

1009
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,699
our third of the message that's missing.

1010
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,369
Well, I assume you've taken every
precaution to guard the Clifford music box.

1011
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:02,789
Oh yes, it's carefully
hidden at Baker Street

1012
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:03,919
with Doctor Watson on guard.

1013
00:51:03,985 --> 00:51:06,590
However, I'm reasonably certain that,

1014
00:51:06,656 --> 00:51:09,800
difficult as it may be,
we can find the plates

1015
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,050
even without the missing
part of the message.

1016
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:14,931
"Behind books, third shelf,

1017
00:51:14,997 --> 00:51:17,681
secretary, Doctor 'S'."

1018
00:51:17,747 --> 00:51:20,351
Well, outside of the fact that Davidson
hid the Bank of England plates

1019
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:21,772
somewhere in London, Mr. Holmes,

1020
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:23,812
I don't see that we've progressed at all.

1021
00:51:23,878 --> 00:51:29,322
Allow me to point out to you,
sir, the key words Doctor 'S'.

1022
00:51:29,388 --> 00:51:32,453
It looks as if the plates were
hidden in the house of a doctor.

1023
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,913
Whether the 'S' stands for
his first or last initial

1024
00:51:34,979 --> 00:51:37,834
remains to be determined by
a process of elimination.

1025
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,084
Well, there must be ten
thousand doctors in London

1026
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,754
with 'S' for a first or last initial.

1027
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,874
Precisely and every one of them

1028
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,545
will have to be questioned in person.

1029
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:49,175
That's why I say this is
a task for Scotland Yard.

1030
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:51,055
It's a task all right

1031
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:54,346
but Scotland Yard has searched worse
haystacks and found a needle.

1032
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:56,346
Well, for the time being

1033
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:58,816
I'll leave the matter in
your hands, gentlemen.

1034
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:03,447
We'll call you if and when we get a
lead on our mysterious Doctor S.

1035
00:52:03,513 --> 00:52:04,607
Thank you.

1036
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:05,737
In the meantime, I intend to follow up

1037
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:08,233
a little clue concerning a cigarette.

1038
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:17,288
You are certain of the
identification of the tobacco?

1039
00:52:17,354 --> 00:52:18,538
Absolutely.

1040
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:20,169
I have made up this special blend

1041
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,629
for only three customers.

1042
00:52:22,695 --> 00:52:25,179
It is almost pure Egyptian

1043
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:29,140
with a mixture of Latakia for added body

1044
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:31,310
and a pinch of Perique,

1045
00:52:31,376 --> 00:52:33,730
merely a whisper as one might say

1046
00:52:33,796 --> 00:52:35,981
- for elusive fragrance.
- Yes Yes,

1047
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:38,441
and the three customers?

1048
00:52:38,507 --> 00:52:41,901
Major Wilson in Bombay, India.

1049
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:45,652
Mrs. Catherine Lemington
Smith in Ireland.

1050
00:52:45,718 --> 00:52:47,362
Yes and the third?

1051
00:52:47,428 --> 00:52:51,493
Mrs. Hilda Courtney of Park
Mansions, Briarstone Square.

1052
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,703
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You've been most helpful.

1053
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:56,359
It is a pleasure to of
been service, Mr. Holmes.

1054
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,844
Yes?

1055
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:09,095
Mrs. Courtney?

1056
00:53:09,161 --> 00:53:10,095
Yes.

1057
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:12,015
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

1058
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:14,645
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

1059
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:17,282
I've heard of you,
of course, Mr. Holmes.

1060
00:53:18,802 --> 00:53:21,866
I believe we have a mutual
friend in Sir Edward Brookdale.

1061
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,786
He's spoken to me of you quite often.

1062
00:53:23,852 --> 00:53:25,363
Indeed.

1063
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:31,077
And to what good fortune
am I indebted for this visit?

1064
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:32,958
I think you know, Mrs. Courtney.

1065
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:37,218
Well, I did get a summons
for speeding last week

1066
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:40,428
but outside of that I don't think
I'm of any interest to the police.

1067
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:41,929
Oh, come now, Mrs. Courtney,

1068
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:44,389
you seemed to forget that
you and I have met before.

1069
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,309
I'm sorry,

1070
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:48,940
I'm sure I would have remembered
meeting the great Sherlock Holmes.

1071
00:53:49,006 --> 00:53:51,600
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1072
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,400
You say we met before?

1073
00:53:53,466 --> 00:53:55,190
Yes.

1074
00:53:55,256 --> 00:53:59,901
At the home of Mr. & Mrs.
Kilgour, 143 B Hampton Road.

1075
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:01,531
Kilgour?

1076
00:54:01,597 --> 00:54:04,991
I don't think I know anyone of that name.

1077
00:54:05,057 --> 00:54:07,252
Well, I didn't say you knew them,

1078
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:10,622
as a matter of fact, you called
on them when they were out.

1079
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:13,252
Why I don't understand,
Mr. Holmes.

1080
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:14,753
Really?

1081
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,843
You were dressed rather differently.

1082
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:18,843
Indeed.

1083
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:20,789
Cigarette?

1084
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:22,750
Thank you.

1085
00:54:39,602 --> 00:54:42,246
You know Mrs. Courtney,
people generally forget,

1086
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,826
you know assuming your disguise,

1087
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:46,497
that the shape of the ear

1088
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:48,587
is almost an infallible
means of recognition

1089
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:50,797
and identification to the trained eye.

1090
00:54:50,863 --> 00:54:52,877
Evidently you've mistaken
me for someone else.

1091
00:54:52,943 --> 00:54:54,047
Oh no, not at all,

1092
00:54:54,113 --> 00:54:57,178
though naturally I expected your denial

1093
00:54:57,244 --> 00:55:00,268
but when you paid your visit
to my rooms at Baker Street

1094
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:02,689
you carelessly left behind

1095
00:55:02,755 --> 00:55:05,859
an another identification.

1096
00:55:05,925 --> 00:55:09,729
They're identical aren't they?

1097
00:55:09,795 --> 00:55:12,030
Yes, I must admit they are.

1098
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:14,410
You see Mr. Holmes to
catch one as clever as you

1099
00:55:14,476 --> 00:55:16,990
I had to use a very special lure.

1100
00:55:17,056 --> 00:55:19,951
I knew you'd be unable to
resist the bait of my cigarette

1101
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:22,831
having read with great interest
your monograph on the ashes

1102
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:26,171
of a hundred and forty
different varieties of tobacco.

1103
00:55:26,237 --> 00:55:31,672
I should advise you
not to move, Mr. Holmes.

1104
00:55:31,738 --> 00:55:34,682
I must congratulate you on
your ingenuity, Mrs. Courtney.

1105
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,933
It was indeed a brilliantly designed trap.

1106
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:38,603
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

1107
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,773
Praise from a master is indeed gratifying.

1108
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,354
I shall always cherish the memory
of your flatter and words.

1109
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,564
Memory?

1110
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,404
Precisely.

1111
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,325
I'm afraid these gentlemen have a
most regrettable task to perform.

1112
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:57,995
Unless, of course, you care to
turn over the missing musical box

1113
00:55:58,061 --> 00:56:02,206
with your pledge to take no
action against us in the future.

1114
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:04,006
I'm afraid that will be impossible.

1115
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,716
I thought that would
be your answer. Hamid!

1116
00:56:06,782 --> 00:56:08,297
Careful!

1117
00:56:08,363 --> 00:56:11,637
Careful, there's no need
to be unnecessarily rough

1118
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:13,267
with our distinguished guest.

1119
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,557
You realize, Mr. Holmes,

1120
00:56:14,623 --> 00:56:17,228
that your demise will not take place here,

1121
00:56:17,294 --> 00:56:20,818
the Corpus Delicti you know?

1122
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:22,358
Well, naturally.

1123
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:23,934
Shall we go?

1124
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,319
So fearfully awkward having
a dead body lying about.

1125
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,699
Don't you agree, Mr. Holmes?

1126
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:32,119
Another dead body shouldn't
weigh too heavily

1127
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:34,156
on your conscious,
Mrs. Courtney.

1128
00:56:43,657 --> 00:56:45,971
Do you mind if I have a cigarette?

1129
00:56:46,037 --> 00:56:48,237
Why I don't see why not.

1130
00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:03,653
Be careful, Hamid.

1131
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,920
It's the brakes, they bind.

1132
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,574
Thank you Colonel Cavanaugh,

1133
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,290
it's very considerate of you.

1134
00:57:41,554 --> 00:57:43,318
You'll be happy to know,
Mr. Holmes,

1135
00:57:43,384 --> 00:57:46,464
that your death will be a painless one.

1136
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:49,749
Hamid,

1137
00:57:49,815 --> 00:57:52,835
attach this to the motor of the taxi.

1138
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:57,760
That little attachment,
my dear Mr. Holmes,

1139
00:57:57,826 --> 00:58:01,680
contains the deadly fluid
known as, monosulfide,

1140
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:03,931
the Germans use it with gratifying results

1141
00:58:03,997 --> 00:58:07,577
in removing their undesirables.

1142
00:58:11,628 --> 00:58:13,508
Start the motor.

1143
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,791
Tape his mouth.

1144
00:58:44,212 --> 00:58:48,562
Now, up with him, Hamid.

1145
00:58:57,263 --> 00:59:01,948
You find yourself like
Muhammad's coffin, Mr. Holmes,

1146
00:59:02,014 --> 00:59:07,064
suspended between heaven and Earth.

1147
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:13,669
Plenty of fuel in the tank?

1148
00:59:13,735 --> 00:59:15,009
Good.

1149
00:59:15,075 --> 00:59:17,010
It would be too bad to
have anything go wrong

1150
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:20,926
through so simple an oversight.

1151
01:00:29,954 --> 01:00:30,969
Good afternoon.

1152
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:32,299
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

1153
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:33,969
No, I'm Doctor Watson.

1154
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:36,309
Oh, of course, Doctor Watson.

1155
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:37,769
How stupid of me.

1156
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:40,560
Not at all, it's stupid of me.

1157
01:00:40,626 --> 01:00:41,770
Won't you come in?

1158
01:00:41,836 --> 01:00:44,150
Well, I really came
to see Mr. Holmes.

1159
01:00:44,216 --> 01:00:46,740
Oh I'm afraid he's out. I don't
know when he'll be back.

1160
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,401
Perhaps there's something I can do.

1161
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:49,701
Won't you sit down?

1162
01:00:49,767 --> 01:00:51,031
Thank you.

1163
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:53,911
You know Sherlock Holmes
and I have been engaged

1164
01:00:53,977 --> 01:00:55,702
on a great many cases.

1165
01:00:55,768 --> 01:00:57,502
- Oh, really?
- Yes indeed.

1166
01:00:57,568 --> 01:00:59,372
As a matter of fact,

1167
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:02,002
at this very moment we're involved
in one of the most baffling...

1168
01:01:02,068 --> 01:01:04,593
Well, won't you tell me your trouble.

1169
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:05,923
I may be able to help you.

1170
01:01:05,989 --> 01:01:07,843
That's very kind of you, Doctor Watson,

1171
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:11,263
perhaps if I wouldn't
be imposing too much...

1172
01:01:11,329 --> 01:01:12,604
Imposing?

1173
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,104
Oh, it's no imposition,
no imposition at all.

1174
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,724
A pleasure I assure you now.

1175
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,934
- Tell me all about it Miss...
- Miss Williams.

1176
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,645
Mrs. Williams.

1177
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,355
I live in Surrey, Doctor Watson,

1178
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:25,075
and I've come to London
on sheer desperation.

1179
01:01:25,141 --> 01:01:26,615
My only sister has disappeared

1180
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:28,946
and the local police seem
utterly unable to find her.

1181
01:01:29,012 --> 01:01:31,746
Well, Holmes and I solved a
case exactly like that once.

1182
01:01:31,812 --> 01:01:33,916
Very interesting as far as I remember.

1183
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,956
I called it

1184
01:01:36,022 --> 01:01:38,377
"The Adventure Of The
Solitary Cyclist."

1185
01:01:38,443 --> 01:01:40,757
Oh, sorry. Now I
come to think of it,

1186
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,887
it wasn't so very similar,
entirely different now.

1187
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:45,808
I can't figure what I was saying.

1188
01:01:45,874 --> 01:01:48,138
Where were we?

1189
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,518
She's only seventeen, Doctor Watson

1190
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:52,518
and until she disappeared last Thursday

1191
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:55,899
she seemed to be in the best of spirits.

1192
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:58,609
Well, possibly a romantic entanglement.

1193
01:01:58,675 --> 01:02:00,529
Oh no, no, nothing of the sort.

1194
01:02:00,595 --> 01:02:03,110
She left no note, didn't even pack a bag,

1195
01:02:03,176 --> 01:02:04,700
no explanation,

1196
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,240
she just started to walk to the village

1197
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,450
from our house in broad daylight

1198
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,581
and simply vanished from
the face of the Earth.

1199
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:13,211
Oh there, there, there, there.

1200
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:14,461
Might I have a glass of water?

1201
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,841
Glass of water,
yes of course. Glass of...

1202
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,598
I'll have one in one minute.

1203
01:02:50,152 --> 01:02:51,166
There you are, my dear.

1204
01:02:51,232 --> 01:02:53,166
Thank you, Doctor Watson.

1205
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:54,466
Now, now you're not to cry anymore.

1206
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:56,336
You must pull yourself together.

1207
01:02:56,402 --> 01:02:58,507
I feel much better already knowing
that you're going to help me.

1208
01:02:58,573 --> 01:03:00,177
Oh, Doctor Watson, look!

1209
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,803
Good heavens!

1210
01:03:05,753 --> 01:03:08,504
Get through, get through
the fire brigade, quickly.

1211
01:03:12,214 --> 01:03:14,649
Haven't you a fire extinguisher?

1212
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:16,915
By Jove, we have one, in the kitchen.

1213
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:40,472
Don't you worry, Miss Williams

1214
01:03:40,538 --> 01:03:42,518
we'll have this thing out in no time.

1215
01:03:52,179 --> 01:03:54,009
Now, that's got it.

1216
01:03:57,930 --> 01:03:59,400
Let's get some air.

1217
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:05,125
Well, you see there was no need
for the fire brigade after all.

1218
01:04:05,191 --> 01:04:07,851
I hope you weren't too
frightened, Miss Williams.

1219
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:12,506
Oh, gone.

1220
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:14,096
That's the trouble with women,

1221
01:04:14,162 --> 01:04:16,632
they always lose their
heads in an emergency.

1222
01:04:19,662 --> 01:04:21,043
Hello.

1223
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:28,568
The musical box.

1224
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:30,374
Great Scott!

1225
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:35,344
Miss Williams!

1226
01:04:41,275 --> 01:04:42,695
Well?

1227
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:44,880
Good.

1228
01:04:44,946 --> 01:04:45,920
And Holmes?

1229
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:47,420
By now Mr. Holmes has no doubt

1230
01:04:47,486 --> 01:04:50,010
exchanged his violin for a harp.

1231
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:53,337
Oh, well assuming that
heaven is his destination.

1232
01:04:55,247 --> 01:04:57,667
And now that we have
the missing musical box.

1233
01:05:08,058 --> 01:05:12,033
- Nineteenth note,
- Nineteenth note,

1234
01:05:12,099 --> 01:05:15,833
- nineteenth letter.
- Nineteenth letter.

1235
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:17,730
"S".

1236
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,924
He hasn't been there you say?

1237
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:23,794
Holmes, where on earth
where have you been?

1238
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,384
I've been trying to get you at the club,

1239
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,601
at Scotland Yard, all over London.

1240
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:31,515
You were looking for
me in the wrong places.

1241
01:05:31,581 --> 01:05:33,595
Holmes, a terrible thing's happened.

1242
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:35,146
I've been duped.

1243
01:05:35,212 --> 01:05:36,936
That woman,

1244
01:05:37,002 --> 01:05:38,816
- she made a complete fool of me.
- Well, what do you mean?

1245
01:05:38,882 --> 01:05:41,066
Well, she came here and
let off a smoke bomb.

1246
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:42,397
I thought the whole place was on fire

1247
01:05:42,463 --> 01:05:44,737
and my first thought was
to save the musical box.

1248
01:05:44,803 --> 01:05:46,697
No need to say anymore.

1249
01:05:46,763 --> 01:05:47,907
She has the box.

1250
01:05:47,973 --> 01:05:49,997
Yes.

1251
01:05:50,063 --> 01:05:53,618
Don't blame yourself too much, old fellow.

1252
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:56,344
She is an extremely clever antagonist.

1253
01:05:59,195 --> 01:06:03,379
Smoke bomb you said?

1254
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:06,349
Well, you can console
yourself with the thought

1255
01:06:06,415 --> 01:06:08,930
that your charming friend
is at least a reader of yours.

1256
01:06:08,996 --> 01:06:10,140
What do you mean?

1257
01:06:10,206 --> 01:06:12,100
If I remember correctly,

1258
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:14,400
you wrote about my little experiment
with the smoke and the cry of fire

1259
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:17,061
in the story you entitled
"A Scandal in Bohemia",

1260
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:18,941
which has just appeared
in the Strand Magazine.

1261
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:23,242
All right, all right, old boy,
don't rub it in.

1262
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:27,952
It may cheer you up to know
that she made a fool of me too.

1263
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:30,122
With that cigarette stub.

1264
01:06:30,188 --> 01:06:33,213
It was planted here for
one express purpose.

1265
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:34,833
Do we have any bandaging
around this place?

1266
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:37,423
Bandaging? What's the matter, Holmes?
You hurt?

1267
01:06:37,489 --> 01:06:39,594
Explanations will have
to wait until later,

1268
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,634
at the moment we're faced with a problem,

1269
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,304
which I fear, is insurmountable.

1270
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,850
- Come over here, old boy, will ya?
- Right.

1271
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,765
Now the opponents are in possession

1272
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:50,435
of all three parts of the code

1273
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:53,145
and here are we while the
Bank of England plates

1274
01:06:53,211 --> 01:06:54,605
pass into their possession.

1275
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:56,356
Cheer up, old fellow, cheer up.

1276
01:06:56,422 --> 01:06:58,066
As Doctor Samuel Johnson once said

1277
01:06:58,132 --> 01:07:00,826
"There's no problem the
mind of man can set

1278
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,086
that the mind of
man cannot solve."

1279
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:06,257
- What's that, old fellow?
- I was quoting Doctor Samuel Johnson,

1280
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:09,343
- he said there is no...
- Thank you, Watson, thank you.

1281
01:07:12,814 --> 01:07:14,838
Leaving the front reception room

1282
01:07:14,904 --> 01:07:16,928
we come into the main hall

1283
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:19,968
where Doctor Johnson was in
the habit of passing through

1284
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:22,969
to have his meager meals in
the dining room opposite.

1285
01:07:23,035 --> 01:07:25,559
In company with his friend and biographer,

1286
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,849
James Bosvo.

1287
01:07:27,915 --> 01:07:29,860
We will now pass up the stairway,

1288
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:33,070
which remains in it's natural wood finish.

1289
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:36,150
Just as it was when the
good doctor was here.

1290
01:07:36,216 --> 01:07:37,911
The framed etching on the wall

1291
01:07:37,977 --> 01:07:40,531
is believed to have been
presented to Doctor Johnson

1292
01:07:40,597 --> 01:07:44,371
by the distinguished painter,
Sir Joshua Reynolds.

1293
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,622
I've been told here that that picture

1294
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,462
was given to him by Mrs. Tarrel

1295
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:50,922
and its definitely not a Reynolds.

1296
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:53,673
Is that important, my dear?

1297
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:55,893
Oh, I'm sorry.

1298
01:07:55,959 --> 01:07:58,383
This way ladies and
gentlemen please, this way.

1299
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,569
Move along children, move along.

1300
01:08:01,429 --> 01:08:03,064
The secretary's not on this floor.

1301
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,524
Patience, Hamid.

1302
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:06,484
- I have a feeling...
- My dear Colonel

1303
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:10,031
with Sherlock Holmes out of
the way what could go wrong?

1304
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:20,286
And here we have the gallant library

1305
01:08:20,352 --> 01:08:23,626
in which Doctor Johnson
wrote his famous dictionary

1306
01:08:23,692 --> 01:08:25,546
and in which you will see also

1307
01:08:25,612 --> 01:08:27,006
many of the great man's books

1308
01:08:27,073 --> 01:08:29,086
and other items of interest.

1309
01:08:29,153 --> 01:08:32,176
Step forward ladies and
gentlemen, please step forward.

1310
01:08:32,243 --> 01:08:34,428
Standing in the corner is the secretary,

1311
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:36,768
which contains many of the original works

1312
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,978
by the literary genius.

1313
01:08:39,044 --> 01:08:42,148
On this table Doctor Johnson's cat Hodge

1314
01:08:42,214 --> 01:08:44,009
used to sleep while his master worked.

1315
01:08:44,075 --> 01:08:46,831
But the strange thing
about this cat, ladies

1316
01:08:46,897 --> 01:08:49,398
and gentlemen, was its love of oysters.

1317
01:08:49,465 --> 01:08:51,910
They do say that the dear
Doctor often went hungry

1318
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:54,950
to find the cat that delicacy.

1319
01:08:55,015 --> 01:08:56,700
What a pity.

1320
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,160
Now we will visit the bedroom,

1321
01:08:58,226 --> 01:09:00,371
which is immediately below us

1322
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:02,621
in which you will see the very bed

1323
01:09:02,687 --> 01:09:04,671
in which Doctor Johnson died.

1324
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:06,921
What did he die of?

1325
01:09:06,987 --> 01:09:08,342
Gout.

1326
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:10,232
Just gout.

1327
01:09:10,298 --> 01:09:11,842
This way ladies and gentlemen,

1328
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:13,558
mind the steps please.

1329
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:27,990
The keys.

1330
01:09:44,192 --> 01:09:45,892
Third shelf up.

1331
01:09:52,122 --> 01:09:53,593
The knife.

1332
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:01,724
Gentlemen, the Bank of England plates.

1333
01:10:03,714 --> 01:10:05,199
Well, Mrs. Courtney,

1334
01:10:05,264 --> 01:10:07,489
so we meet again.

1335
01:10:07,555 --> 01:10:10,489
Now, I shouldn't do that if I
were you, Colonel Cavanaugh.

1336
01:10:10,555 --> 01:10:12,830
I must congratulate you,
Mr. Holmes.

1337
01:10:12,896 --> 01:10:16,670
You're far more clever than I thought.

1338
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:18,920
Thank you, Mrs. Courtney.

1339
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:22,050
Praise from you is indeed gratifying.

1340
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,630
I shall always cherish the memory

1341
01:10:24,697 --> 01:10:26,471
of your flattering words.

1342
01:10:26,537 --> 01:10:27,931
Memory?

1343
01:10:27,996 --> 01:10:30,722
Oh, thank you.

1344
01:10:30,788 --> 01:10:34,318
And now I have a most
regrettable task to perform.

1345
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:41,023
Holmes!

1346
01:10:41,089 --> 01:10:42,789
Coming Holmes!

1347
01:10:44,259 --> 01:10:45,654
Holmes!

1348
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:46,664
You all right?

1349
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:49,424
Perfectly, thank you, old fellow but
I think this gentleman on the floor

1350
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,074
requires some medical attention.

1351
01:10:51,139 --> 01:10:53,334
We must see that he looks his
best, you know, when he's hanged.

1352
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,911
Take them in charge.

1353
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:14,107
A brilliant antagonist.

1354
01:11:14,173 --> 01:11:16,597
It's a pity her talents
were so misdirected.

1355
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:18,117
Will you see that these plates

1356
01:11:18,183 --> 01:11:20,098
are returned to the Bank
of England, Inspector?

1357
01:11:20,164 --> 01:11:22,148
I still don't understand how
you solved it, Mr. Holmes.

1358
01:11:22,214 --> 01:11:24,198
It's entirely due to Doctor Watson.

1359
01:11:24,264 --> 01:11:27,459
He gave me the clue when he
mentioned Doctor Samuel Johnson.

1360
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:29,228
Well, congratulations, Doctor.

1361
01:11:29,295 --> 01:11:30,559
Oh, thank you, Inspector.

1362
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:34,956
I don't think I could have done it
entirely without Mr. Holmes' help you know?
