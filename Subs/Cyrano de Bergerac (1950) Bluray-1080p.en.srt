1
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:43,664
<i>Thrice happy he who hides
from pomp and power</i>

2
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:47,367
<i>in sylvan shade
or solitary bower</i>

3
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:51,411
<i>where balmy zephyrs
fan his burning cheeks...</i>

4
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:55,244
- Clown! The king of clowns!
Leave the stage at once!

5
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:58,407
Who is it?

6
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:01,360
It's Cyrano.
I was afraid he'd do this.

7
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,043
<i>Thrice happy he
who hides from pomp and power...</i>

8
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,706
- Wretch! Did I not forbid
you to appear this month?

9
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,060
- Let's be quiet.
- Quiet!

10
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,182
Go on Montfleury.

11
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,206
<i>Thrice happy he who...</i>

12
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,437
He who, indeed.

13
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,540
Donkeys say rather Hee-Haw!

14
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:31,606
Begone! Or must I come and
help you off the stage myself?

15
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,822
What! Still there?

16
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:42,045
Where balmy zephyrs
fan his burning cheeks...

17
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:45,879
Fat swine, if you dare breathe
on balmy zephyr more

18
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:48,471
I'll fan your cheeks
for you!

19
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,312
Monsieur, won't you all
protect me?

20
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:51,924
- Proceed, proceed.
- Go on.

21
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:54,716
Sir, I will not allow you
to insult me in this manner.

22
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:57,359
Really?
What manner would you prefer?

23
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,690
Quiet, down there!

24
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,782
- We'll tolerate
no more of this.

25
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:03,564
Go on with the play,
Montfleury.

26
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:08,328
Unless these gentlemen
retain your seats

27
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:10,640
my sword may
bite their ribbons.

28
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,502
Who is this braggart?

29
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,924
My cousin, sir.

30
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,567
Well, Montfleury,
still no exit?

31
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:20,789
- Very well then,
I enter

32
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,603
with knife, to carve
this fat, stuffed goose.

33
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,043
I pray, do not crowd
my scabbard here.

34
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,194
She may put her
tongue out at you.

35
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:44,870
Silence.

36
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,713
I say be silent!

37
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:52,147
And I offer one universal
challenge to you all:

38
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,299
Will all who wish to die,
please raise their hands.

39
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,252
Approach, young heroes.
I will take your names.

40
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,725
To the first man who falls
I'll build a monument.

41
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,607
Who will head the list?

42
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:04,678
You, sir?

43
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:06,599
No.

44
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:07,510
You?

45
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:09,071
No, no.

46
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:10,673
Anyone?

47
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,505
Anyone at all?

48
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,459
Not one... name?

49
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:20,331
Not one finger?

50
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,175
Very well then,
I go on.

51
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,732
Attend to me, Full Moon.

52
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:38,117
I clap my hands three times, thus.

53
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,252
At the third, you will...
eclipse yourself.

54
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:45,323
Ready!

55
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:46,845
One.

56
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,007
How dare you.

57
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:51,148
I demand!

58
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,009
I insist.

59
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,091
- I call upon all the nobles...
- Two!

60
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:57,033
This is an outrage.

61
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:57,984
You hear, an outrage.

62
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,567
Nothing on earth
will move me from this stage.

63
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:02,748
Three!

64
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:13,168
Fair ladies and noble gentlemen...
- Boo!

65
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,172
But, Monsieur de Bergerac,

66
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,455
why have you done this
to our Montfleury, an admirable actor?

67
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:24,057
I have two reasons,
either one conclusive.

68
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:26,770
First, he is an
abominable actor,

69
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,842
who mouths his verse
and moans his tragedy.

70
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,604
Second,

71
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,947
Well, that's my secret.

72
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:39,260
But...
But you've closed the play!

73
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,862
It is not a very good play.

74
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,954
Huh!
And of their money?

75
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,066
Possibly you would like
that returned to these good people.

76
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:45,946
Yes?

77
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,348
Yes.

78
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:49,820
Here, catch!

79
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:55,955
Well, Monsieur, you are hereby
authorized to close our play every night.

80
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,196
On these terms.

81
00:06:57,777 --> 00:07:00,399
Ladies and gentlemen,
your money will be returned.

82
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,251
Kindly pass out, quietly.

83
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,032
Goodnight, goodnight.

84
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,623
Your cousin is an
extraordinary man, Madame.

85
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,094
Oh, I agree.

86
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:22,568
Soldier, poet, philosopher,
musician, playwright.

87
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:23,589
All those?

88
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:27,383
Yes, and the best
swordsman in Paris.

89
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:28,333
Really?

90
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,086
Now, I should have thought
the Vicomte here had that honor.

91
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:35,390
Tell me, Madame, that
comic mask, that nose,

92
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,331
presently he will take it off?

93
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:39,984
No, Monsieur, he keeps it.

94
00:07:40,484 --> 00:07:43,387
And heaven help
the man who smiles.

95
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,098
Good night.

96
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:51,924
Oh, Monsieur!

97
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,026
Monsieur!

98
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,758
Uh, when do you leave Paris?

99
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,150
Sir?

100
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,331
Why, after what you've
just done to Montfleury,

101
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,804
did you not know that
the Compte de Guiche was his patron?

102
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:04,245
Who's yours?

103
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,197
No one.

104
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:06,997
No one?

105
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,928
No patron?

106
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:08,689
I said not.

107
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,961
But the Compte de Guiche
has a long arm.

108
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,963
Mine is longer
by three feet of steel.

109
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,244
Yes, but.

110
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:16,225
but, what a scare...

111
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,056
You may go now.

112
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,577
- but...
- You may go.

113
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,691
Well, tell me,
why are you staring at my nose?

114
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,232
Oh, I was not staring.

115
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,704
Does it astonish you?

116
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:27,996
Why n... Why no, I've been careful
not to look.

117
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:29,587
Oh, and why not, if you please?

118
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:30,808
It disgusts you, then?

119
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:31,959
But, no, I just...

120
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,781
Does its color appear
to you unwholesome?

121
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:34,561
By no means.

122
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,393
Then, possibly you find it
just a trifle large?

123
00:08:36,423 --> 00:08:38,585
No, small, very small, tiny!

124
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:39,726
Infinitesimal!

125
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:43,049
What?
You accuse me of absurdity?

126
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,822
Small, my nose?
Why magnificent, my nose!

127
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:48,994
You pug, you knob,
you button head,

128
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:51,266
know that I glory
in this nose of mine!

129
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:53,498
For a great nose
indicates a great man,

130
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:59,543
congenial, courteous,
intellectual, virile, courageous.

131
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:02,156
Whilst that face of yours,

132
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:08,181
that blank, inglorious concavity
which my right hand finds on top of you,

133
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:13,746
is as devoid of pride, of poetry,
of soul, of picturesqueness,

134
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:18,930
of contour, of character,
of nose, in short,

135
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,865
As that which is at the bottom of that limp,
spine of yours my left foot.- Oh, help!

136
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:27,968
Presently, this fellow
will grow tiresome.

137
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:30,721
Oh, he blows his horn.

138
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:33,933
- Well, will no one
put him in his place?

139
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,796
If you would all me.
Observe.

140
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:45,403
Monsieur, your nose,
your nose is rather large.

141
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:49,547
Rather?

142
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,498
Oh, well.

143
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,769
Is that all?

144
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:52,690
Well, of course, you...

145
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,551
Ah, no young sir, you're too simple.

146
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,773
Why, you might have
said a great many things.

147
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,955
Why waste your opportunity?

148
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:00,016
For example, thus...

149
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,608
Aggressive-

150
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:05,201
I, sir, if that great nose were mine,
I would have it amputated on the spot.

151
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:06,872
Practical-

152
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:10,736
How do you drink with such a nose.
You must have had a cup made especially.

153
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:12,047
Descriptive-

154
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:14,739
'Tis a rock, a crag, a cape.

155
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:19,684
A cape, say rather, a peninsula.

156
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,165
Inquisitive-

157
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:25,579
Uh, what is that receptacle,
a razor case or a portfolio?

158
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:26,860
Kindly-

159
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,023
Ah, do you love the little birds so much
that when they come and sing to you,

160
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,875
you give them this to perch on?

161
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:34,757
Cautious-

162
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:38,310
Take care. A weight like that
might make you top-heavy.

163
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,441
Eloquent-

164
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:43,705
When it blows the typhoon howls
and the clouds darken.

165
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:44,595
Dramatic-

166
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,889
When it bleeds... the Red Sea.

167
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,731
Simple-

168
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,843
Eh, when do they
unveil the monument?

169
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:55,105
Military-

170
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,717
Beware, a secret weapon!

171
00:10:58,498 --> 00:10:59,829
Enterprising-

172
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,291
What a sigh for some perfumer!

173
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,512
Respectful-

174
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:06,264
Uh sir, I recognize in you
a man of parts,

175
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:08,957
a man of... prominence.

176
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:10,718
Or, Literary-

177
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,581
Was this the nose
that launched a thousand ships?

178
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,074
These, my dear sir, are things
you might have said had you

179
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:19,916
some tinge of letters or of wit
to color your discourse.

180
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,198
Bit wit not so.
You never had an atom.

181
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:28,714
And of letters, you need
but three to write you down, a..s..s.

182
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,766
Ass.

183
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,277
You, sir!

184
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:34,839
Dolt! Bumpkin! Fool!

185
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,865
How do you do, and I,
Cyrano Savinien Hercule de Bergerac.

186
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:42,296
Vicomte, come.

187
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,898
Such arrogance.
This scarecrow who...

188
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,099
Look at him!

189
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:50,373
No ribbons. No lace.
Not even gloves!

190
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:53,956
True. I carry my adornments
only on my soul.

191
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,118
Decked with deeds
instead of ribbons.

192
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,679
Mantled in my good name,

193
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,611
and crowned with a
white plume of freedom.

194
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:00,392
But..

195
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:01,773
But, I have no gloves.

196
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,894
A pity, too.

197
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:05,897
I had one, the last one of an old pair,
and lost that.

198
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,518
Very careless of me.

199
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:10,020
Some gentleman offered me
an impertinence.

200
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,114
I left it in his face.

201
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:15,115
So be it!

202
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:19,328
You shall die exquisitely

203
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:20,439
Oh, a poet.

204
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,921
Oh, yes, a poet if you will.

205
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:25,794
So, uh, while we fight,
I'll improvise a ballad for you,

206
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:29,557
and as I end the refrain,
skhrch! thrust home.

207
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:30,568
Will you?

208
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:32,420
I will.

209
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:41,187
Ballad au Duel
at the Theatre de Burgoyne

210
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:44,620
between de Bergerac,
and uh... a barbarian.

211
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,542
What do you mean by that?

212
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:47,303
Oh, that?

213
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,265
The title.

214
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,507
Stop. Let me choose my rhyme.

215
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:01,956
So. Here we go.

216
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:04,388
Lightly I toss my hat away.

217
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:09,762
Languidly o'er my arm let fall
the cloak that covers my bright array.

218
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:15,097
Then, out swords,
and to work withal.

219
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:20,051
A Lancelot in his lady's hall,

220
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:24,916
A Spartacus at the Hippodrome,

221
00:13:25,656 --> 00:13:27,678
I dally a while with you..

222
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:29,089
you jackall.

223
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,717
Just as I end the refrain,

224
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:51,739
thrust home!

225
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:08,594
Where shall I skewer my peacock again?

226
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,540
Nay, better for you
to have shunned this brawl.

227
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,393
Here in the heart
or your ribbons, gay,

228
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:20,995
in the belly
'neath you silken shawl?

229
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:31,524
Now, come my points floats,
light as the foam

230
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,035
ready to drive you
back to the wall,

231
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:34,427
and then as I end the refrain,

232
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:35,838
thrust home.

233
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:37,609
Oh, for a rhyme.

234
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,461
Why, your fight is fading.

235
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:40,442
You break.

236
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,373
You cower.

237
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:42,304
You cringe.

238
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:43,304
You crawl.

239
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,146
How can I tell
you're allowed to say

240
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,157
something to turn on my head

241
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,128
forestall...

242
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:48,069
Life with a tunny

243
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:49,380
death with a scall.

244
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,171
Something to turn on my fancy roam,

245
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,083
free for a time till the rhyme's recall,

246
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,035
then as I end the refrain,

247
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:56,036
thrust home!

248
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:59,088
Refrain.

249
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:03,382
Prince,
pray God that is Lord of all,

250
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,264
pardon you soul,

251
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,617
for your time has come.

252
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,251
Pass! I fling you aslant, asprawl.

253
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,022
Then as I end the refrain,

254
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,145
thrust home!

255
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,945
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, please,

256
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,266
not until the performance is over.

257
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:06,457
Close the house.

258
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:07,298
A strike,

259
00:16:07,678 --> 00:16:08,819
but leave the lights.

260
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:10,551
We rehearse the new
farce tonight.

261
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:16,726
Wait.

262
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:20,059
You have only to watch a fight,

263
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:22,021
or have you ruined
if you listen to them.

264
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,064
Think of the enemies you've made,

265
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:28,547
Montfleury, the Vicomte,
if he lives,

266
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:31,879
all those foppish marquis,
the Comte de Guiche.

267
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,471
That politician.

268
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:36,413
He's the Cardinal's nephew.
There's power there!

269
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,835
And power here.

270
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,186
Young fool!

271
00:16:39,226 --> 00:16:41,048
Take an example from me.

272
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,320
20 years a captain,
while others who know only

273
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,262
how to deploy their
forces at court

274
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:48,404
now dangle a marshal's baton.

275
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:51,877
Well, uh, someday
I will avenge you, too.

276
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,050
Impossible.
Come on, let's go to dinner.

277
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,351
Dinner?
No, not I.

278
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:57,362
Why not?

279
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:59,053
Because I have no money.

280
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:00,675
But, the purse of gold.

281
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,666
Farewell paternal pension.

282
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,959
And you have
until the first of next month?

283
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:06,840
Nothing.

284
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:08,992
What a fool.

285
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,304
Yes, but, what a moment.

286
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:12,205
Pardon, Monsieur.

287
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,308
A man ought
never to go hungry.

288
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:18,690
I have everything here.

289
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:20,902
Please.

290
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:25,627
My dear child, I cannot bend this Gascon
pride of mine to accept such a kindness.

291
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,367
But, I...

292
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,361
Yet, for fear that
I may give you pain if I refuse,

293
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:32,743
I will take something.

294
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:35,215
A grape.

295
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:39,719
One only.

296
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:41,731
And a glass of water.

297
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,212
No, clear.

298
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:50,318
And, uh, half a macaroon.

299
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:52,670
Nothing more?

300
00:17:53,631 --> 00:17:54,492
Why, yes.

301
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:56,804
Your hand to kiss.

302
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,100
Thank you, sir.

303
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,692
Good night.

304
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:24,888
Idiot.

305
00:18:27,771 --> 00:18:28,492
Dinner.

306
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:30,764
Drink.

307
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:34,327
Desert.

308
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,281
Mon Dieux, I was hungry,
abominably.

309
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:40,933
Tell me.

310
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,054
Anything.

311
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,536
Why to you hate
this Montfleury?

312
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,478
A very bad actor.

313
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,480
Ah, come now, the real
reason, the truth.

314
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:54,224
That fat goat who cannot hold
his belly in his arms,

315
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:57,217
still dreams of being
sweetly dangerous among the women.

316
00:18:57,857 --> 00:19:02,241
Sighs and languishes, making sheep's
eyes out of his great frog's face.

317
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:07,386
I hate him ever since one day
he dared smile upon...

318
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:13,861
Oh, my friend, I seemed to see over
some flower a great snail crawling.

319
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:15,823
Eh, what?

320
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:17,985
Is it possible?

321
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,827
For me to love?

322
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,311
I love.

323
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:27,223
Whom?
May I know?

324
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:28,274
Whom I love?

325
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:30,656
Think a moment.

326
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:31,937
Think of me.

327
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:35,330
Me, whom the plainest
woman would despise.

328
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,674
Me, with this nose of mine that marches
on before me by a quarter of an hour.

329
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,667
Whom shall I love.

330
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,603
Why, of course, it must be the
woman in the world most beautiful.

331
00:19:50,453 --> 00:19:51,845
Most beautiful?

332
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:57,600
In these eyes of mine...
beyond compare.

333
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,751
Wait.

334
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,123
Your cousin, Roxane.

335
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:03,985
Yes.

336
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:05,767
Roxane.

337
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:07,498
Well?

338
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,711
Why not?
If you love her, tell her so.

339
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:14,865
My old friend.

340
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,248
Look at me and tell me how
much hope remains for me

341
00:20:18,278 --> 00:20:19,669
with this protuberance.

342
00:20:19,699 --> 00:20:21,060
Ahhh, I have no more illusions.

343
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:26,845
Now and then I may grow tender
walking alone in the blue of evening

344
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,839
through some garden fresh with flowers
after the benediction of the rain.

345
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,643
My poor big devil of a nose
inhales April.

346
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:41,668
And I follow with my eyes where
some boy with a girl upon his arm,

347
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:46,853
passes a patch of silver...
and I feel somehow...

348
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:51,217
I wish I had a woman, too,

349
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:56,391
walking with me under the moon,
and holding my arm and smiling.

350
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,973
Then I dream.

351
00:20:59,644 --> 00:21:00,875
I forget.

352
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:07,951
And then I see the shadow
of my profile on the wall.

353
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,794
My friend.

354
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:12,976
My friend.

355
00:21:13,226 --> 00:21:18,120
I have my bitter days,
knowing myself so ugly, so alone.

356
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,012
Ah, but your wit, your courage,

357
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:22,924
why that poor child who just
now offered you your dinner,

358
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:25,467
your saw it, her eyes
did not avoid you.

359
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,680
That is true.

360
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,293
Well, then, Roxane herself,
watching your duel, pale.

361
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,244
Pale?

362
00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,437
Yes, her lips parted.
Her hand at her breast, thus.

363
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:38,788
I saw it.

364
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,031
Speak to her. Speak, man.

365
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,330
She might laugh at me.

366
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:57,264
It is the one thing
in this world I fear.

367
00:21:57,305 --> 00:22:01,278
Pardon, Monsieur,
a lady outside asking for you.

368
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,541
Monsieur.

369
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,062
A Duenna.

370
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:09,325
I have a message for you
from a... a certain lady.

371
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:12,558
She desires to know when
and where she may see you privately.

372
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,870
She has certain
things to tell you.

373
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,651
Certain...

374
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:17,812
Things!

375
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:20,525
She wishes to see me?

376
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,217
We go tomorrow at dawn
to hear mass at St. Rupe

377
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,880
And afterwards, where
would you suggest?

378
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,441
Well, then, I...

379
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,113
- Where?
- Well?

380
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,885
Ah... I am thinking.

381
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:32,896
And you think?

382
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,408
Where?

383
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:36,879
The shop at Ragueneau's.

384
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,401
Yes, yes, Ragueneau,
the pastry cook.

385
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,222
Who dwells?

386
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:42,414
Rue Saint Honore.

387
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:43,515
Eh... Rue Saint Honore.

388
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:48,359
We are agreed. At 7 o'clock.
Until then. Adieu.

389
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:54,775
I'll be there.

390
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:58,948
Me! To see me!

391
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,670
Ah, not quite so gloomy.

392
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,422
After all, she knows
that I exist.

393
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:04,904
Imagine, she has
asked to see me!

394
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:07,086
So, now you're
going to be happy?

395
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:10,198
Happy. I'm going to be a storm. A flame!

396
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:13,281
I need to fight whole
armies all alone!

397
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:14,692
I have ten hearts!

398
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:16,134
I have a hundred arms!

399
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:19,306
I feel too strong
to war with mortals!

400
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:22,009
BRING ME GIANTS!

401
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,102
Quiet, please, shhh.
We are rehearsing back here.

402
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:31,467
So sorry.
Ha, ha, ha.

403
00:23:36,361 --> 00:23:37,152
Cyrano.

404
00:23:37,702 --> 00:23:38,503
Cyrano.

405
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:39,464
Ragueneau.

406
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,787
Oh, thank goodness
you're still here.

407
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,058
Well, what's the matter.

408
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,289
I'm afraid to go home.

409
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,120
Why?

410
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,931
You know those
comic verses I wrote?

411
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,713
About the congregation.

412
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,145
Cyrano, he's hired ruffians.
Bullies.

413
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:54,627
A hundred, waiting for
me on the way home.

414
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,509
They're gonna beat me.
Cane me!

415
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,341
Please, would you permit me
to spend the night with you?

416
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,313
A hundred men,
is that all?

417
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,506
Ragueneau, you're
going home tonight.

418
00:24:04,536 --> 00:24:06,528
But they're armed.
They're cutthroats!

419
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:08,519
Take this lantern.
Forward march.

420
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,661
I say that I'll be the man
to see you to your shop.

421
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,053
Not you, I want no help from you.

422
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:13,414
For even for a hundred,
you're mad.

423
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:14,635
Those are the odds I want.

424
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:17,327
Why for this pastry cook?

425
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:19,729
First, because this
pastry cook is a friend of mine.

426
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,732
Second, because this
pastry cook is also a poet.

427
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,273
And, most important,

428
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,916
if anything should
happen to this pastry cook,

429
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:31,790
tomorrow morning at seven
his shop will be closed.

430
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:34,512
Goodnight.

431
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,471
Cyrano. Help!

432
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:58,576
Look out behind you!

433
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,841
I have been robbed.

434
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:41,103
There are no hundred here.

435
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:47,399
It's, it's, it's...

436
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,271
Be quick. Inside.

437
00:26:51,682 --> 00:26:52,593
Bolt the door!

438
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:04,363
Ah!

439
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,730
Yah!

440
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:16,126
Ah!

441
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:19,679
Awk.

442
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,411
Cyrano!

443
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:33,451
Hold!

444
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:49,476
Ah.

445
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:52,568
How do you feel?

446
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,690
Oh, pleasantly exhilarated.

447
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:58,143
- Come, I know a little tavern not far...
- Where's Ragueneau?

448
00:28:58,463 --> 00:29:01,476
Ragueneau?
Ragueneau!

449
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:04,669
Little boy, come out.
All's well!

450
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,151
- Is it over?
- All over.

451
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,182
Really?

452
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:10,504
So soon?

453
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:11,305
Ha, ha, ha.

454
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:14,648
Oh, if only I'd had my sword.
How many did we kill?

455
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:15,498
Oh, about eight.

456
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:16,529
Eight.

457
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:17,580
Eight!

458
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,591
Ohhhh.

459
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:43,102
This... gentleman
begins to annoy me.

460
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:55,213
No. The sauce and meat must rhyme.
Add a pinch of marigold and thyme.

461
00:29:55,243 --> 00:30:00,167
Your house, of course needs a stronger roof.
Eh? There's proof.

462
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,038
Cyrano.

463
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,110
Cyrano.

464
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,311
Come in and eat.

465
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:06,323
- What time is it?
- Not quite seven.

466
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:09,355
Oh, now, please, Cyrano.
A man without breakfast is like...

467
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:11,938
No.
Could she have changed her mind?

468
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,139
Aw, she wouldn't dare.

469
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,121
We were magnificent last night.

470
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:17,052
And at the theater, too.

471
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,544
'Then, as I end the refrain'...

472
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:22,617
When she arrives.
Where can we converse undisturbed?

473
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,419
Wherever you like.
My shop is yours.

474
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,131
The little dining room
is quite romantic.

475
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:29,723
'Thrust home!'
Yea gods, what a line.

476
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:31,885
- 'Then as I end the re...'
- Vanish.

477
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,346
- Uh, huh, she's come?
- Shhhh.

478
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:34,157
I swear.

479
00:30:42,585 --> 00:30:43,415
Welcome.

480
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,766
- A pardon, one word.
- Oh, yes?

481
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:56,777
Have you a good digestion?

482
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:57,688
Oh, wonderful.

483
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:04,063
Eh, here are some Ã©clairs.
Uh, creampuffs.

484
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:08,427
Some, uh, jellyrolls.
And do you like nature?

485
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,668
I adore it.

486
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,630
Go out and eat these in the sunshine.
Do not return.

487
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,711
But why?

488
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:14,182
Until you have finished them.

489
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:15,613
What do I do then?

490
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:28,285
Blessed above all others be the hour
when you remember to remember me,

491
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:31,087
and came to tell me... what?

492
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,039
To tell you that...

493
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,102
Before I dare tell you I...

494
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,145
Are you, I wonder, still
the same big brother almost

495
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:42,017
that you used to be
when we were children,

496
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:44,869
playing by the pond
in the old garden down there?

497
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:46,871
At Bergerac.
Those lovely summers.

498
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,003
You use to make swords
out of bulrushes.

499
00:31:49,043 --> 00:31:51,115
And you, dandelions
also golden hair.

500
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:53,236
In those days
I could tell you everything.

501
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,168
And you did
everything I wished.

502
00:31:55,368 --> 00:32:00,142
Little Roxane, a sweet tyrone
with short skirts and long hair.

503
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:01,093
Was I pretty?

504
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,588
Not too plain.

505
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,811
Sometimes when you had fallen
or hurt your hand,

506
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:12,994
you used to come running to me,
and I would be your mother and say,

507
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:18,098
oh, with a very grownup voice,
'Now, what have you been doing to yourself?'

508
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,630
'Let me see.'

509
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:22,392
- Oh!
- No one that.

510
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:23,563
Wait, let me see.

511
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:26,876
Still. At your age?

512
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,148
Now, how did you do that?

513
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:32,251
Playing with the big boys
at the Place de Neanne.

514
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:33,752
Come here.

515
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,364
Such a wise little mother.

516
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:40,087
And tell me, while I wash this
blood away, how many you played with?

517
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:42,189
- Oh, about a hundred.
- A hundred?

518
00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:45,302
- More or less.
- It can't be.

519
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:46,433
No.

520
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:49,075
Tell me what you were
going to tell me...

521
00:32:49,486 --> 00:32:50,677
if you dared.

522
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:53,419
I think I do dare, now.

523
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,812
It seems so like
those happy days long ago.

524
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,144
Yes, I dare.

525
00:32:59,715 --> 00:33:02,557
Listen... I love someone.

526
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:03,808
Yes?

527
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,520
Someone who does not know.

528
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,711
Yes?

529
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:10,344
Someone who loves me, too,
but is afraid of me and keeps away

530
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:11,715
and never says one word.

531
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:13,647
Yes.

532
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:15,589
Give my that hand.

533
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,461
Why, how hot it is.

534
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,774
Yes, he loves me.
I am sure of it.

535
00:33:22,124 --> 00:33:22,915
Yes.

536
00:33:23,496 --> 00:33:26,118
And he is a soldier, too,
in your own regiment,

537
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,099
your own company.

538
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:28,140
Yes.

539
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,871
Such a man.

540
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,674
He is proud, noble, young, brave,

541
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,096
beautiful!

542
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:37,948
Beautiful.

543
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,441
What's the matter?

544
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:42,562
Oh, nothing.

545
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:45,615
It's this, my hand.

546
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:49,688
I love him.
That is all.

547
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:53,642
And I have never seen him
anywhere except in the theater.

548
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:56,124
You have never spoken?

549
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:58,206
Only with our hearts.

550
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,498
Well, then, how do you know?

551
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,692
Well, people talk about people,
and I hear things, and...

552
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,125
and I know.

553
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,967
You say he is in the guards?

554
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,959
His name?

555
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,703
Baron Christian de Neuvillette.

556
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,344
You know him?

557
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,086
He is not in the guards.

558
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,457
Yes, since last week.

559
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,989
He is only lately
come to Paris...

560
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,581
from Normandy.

561
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:30,514
So soon.
So soon we lose our hearts.

562
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:31,705
What...

563
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:32,666
Monsieur de Bergerac

564
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,298
I have eaten all the cakes.

565
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,730
Good.
Now, go out and enjoy nature.

566
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:41,564
But my dear child, you love
only words, wit, poetry.

567
00:34:41,604 --> 00:34:45,407
Why, for all you know,
the man may be a savage or a fool.

568
00:34:45,437 --> 00:34:49,751
Not with such eyes.
I read his soul in them.

569
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:53,825
Yes, all our souls are
written in our eyes.

570
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:58,188
And you have brought
me here to tell me this?

571
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:01,361
I do not yet quite understand,
madam, the reason for your confidence.

572
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:08,117
They say, that in your company,
it frightens me, you are all Gascon.

573
00:35:08,157 --> 00:35:10,329
We pick a quarrel with any outsider
who intrudes himself.

574
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,730
Is that what you have heard?

575
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,633
- I'm so afraid for him.
- Not without reason.

576
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:19,217
And I thought you...
it's you whom they all respect and fear.

577
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:24,081
You want me to defend
your little Baron?

578
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,232
Will you?

579
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:27,164
Just for me.

580
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:29,936
Because I have always
been your friend.

581
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:32,288
And this is what
you want of me?

582
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:33,930
Will you be his friend?

583
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:37,703
I will be his friend.

584
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:38,544
And never let him
fight a duel.

585
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:39,565
No, never.

586
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,856
Promise?

587
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,487
I promise.

588
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:46,371
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
I knew I could rely on you.

589
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:50,925
Well, now I must go.

590
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,002
Oh, you never told
me about last night.

591
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,314
Why, you must
have been a hero.

592
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:05,768
Have write and tell me all about it,
and... about himself.

593
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:09,861
Oh, you are a darling.
We are great friends, are we not?

594
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:11,863
He must write to me.

595
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:17,027
A hundred men against one.
You shall tell me the whole story

596
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,519
someday when we have time.

597
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:25,715
A hundred men.
What courage!

598
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:32,361
I have done better.

599
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:38,006
Well?

600
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,609
Let us leave this place.

601
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,180
But the whole company
is on its way here.

602
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,091
Oh, no.

603
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:46,433
On my heels. Naturally I told
them all about last night.

604
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:47,444
They're wild.

605
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,395
Here they are.

606
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,987
- Yes, but, why did you?
- Perhaps I can stop them.

607
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:52,539
Never mind.

608
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,791
Cyrano!

609
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:07,151
Eight dead men in the street.
Scandalous.

610
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,594
You know my edict
against dueling, nephew.

611
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,165
I expect to have it enforced.

612
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,528
Furthermore, I wish to know
who was responsible for last night's

613
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:15,999
outrage at the Place de Neanne.

614
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:17,430
I understand, Your Eminence.

615
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,772
Very well.
And now I have news

616
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,904
that should be more
to you liking.

617
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:29,011
I fear, in confidence, our
uneasy armistice with Spain is doomed.

618
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,011
My colonelcy?

619
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:32,273
You commission has been prepared.

620
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:34,495
Oh, thank you, uncle, thank you.

621
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,237
Oh, one thing more.

622
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:40,210
Last night at the theater,
the duel in rhyme,

623
00:37:40,401 --> 00:37:42,582
that guardsman with a nose.

624
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:45,855
- Bergerac, that impossible Gascon.
- Yes, impossible.

625
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,917
- His treatment of Montfleury.
- Abominable.

626
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:50,850
- The arrogance with which he closed the play.
- Incredible.

627
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,752
- It will be a miracle if the Vicomte survives.
- A sorrow.

628
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:55,344
What will you do
with him, Your Eminence?

629
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:56,725
I? Nothing.

630
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,917
I thought I might
leave that to you.

631
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:00,128
To me?

632
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:03,901
Yes. Place him somewhere
in your service,

633
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,523
with a comfortable allowance.

634
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,024
He looked a little threadbare.

635
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:10,657
I... You... But, Your Eminence.
You detest dueling.

636
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:11,598
Of course I do.

637
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:13,710
Why didn't you prevent it?

638
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,993
I should much prefer
that monsieur de Beregrac

639
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:20,946
live by the pen,
rather than die by the sword.

640
00:38:22,237 --> 00:38:24,119
Do you not agree, Antoine?

641
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,212
By all means, Your Eminence.
By all means.

642
00:38:30,484 --> 00:38:37,310
'And then, as I end the refrain...
thrust home.'

643
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:04,304
Monsieur de Bergerac.

644
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:07,076
Your Excellency.

645
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,439
I have come to express my...

646
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:14,243
admiration for both
your exploits last night.

647
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:16,985
Indeed. Thank you.

648
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:20,598
My dear fellow,
we may have had our differences,

649
00:39:20,628 --> 00:39:23,251
but I am disposed
to forget them.

650
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:25,412
That is very generous
of you, sir.

651
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:26,263
No, truly.

652
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:29,676
You are, it seems, a man
of many skills.

653
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:33,059
A rare combination
soldier and poet.

654
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,463
- Would you care to join my following?
- No, sir.

655
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,974
I do not follow.

656
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,697
I am told you have
written a play.

657
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:45,230
As you know, my uncle,
the Cardinal, is also a dramatist.

658
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,711
I might help you there.

659
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:49,774
Cyrano, now at last
you can have it performed.

660
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,925
Why not?

661
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:52,346
I could take it to him.

662
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,058
Really?

663
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,190
Of course.
Let him rewrite a few lines

664
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,502
here and there, and
he'll find a theater for you.

665
00:40:00,013 --> 00:40:02,965
Rewrite... my lines?

666
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:04,887
Impossible.

667
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:07,780
Uh, when he likes a thing,
he pays well.

668
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,981
Yes, but not so well as I.

669
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:11,203
When I have made a line
that sings itself

670
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,964
I pay myself a hundred times.

671
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,686
You are proud, my friend.

672
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:15,767
You have observed that?

673
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:18,209
- Cyrano.
See what we found in the street.

674
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,891
Plumes dropped in their flight
by those fine birds

675
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,613
who showed their
tail feathers!

676
00:40:24,374 --> 00:40:25,935
The man who hired
those scoundrels,

677
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,767
he must be an
angry man today.

678
00:40:27,807 --> 00:40:29,188
Who was it?
Do you know?

679
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:30,550
It was I.

680
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:35,634
I hired them to do the sort
of work we do not soil our hands with.

681
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:38,707
Punishing an insolent poet.

682
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:41,379
They ought to be mounted
before they spoil.

683
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,621
What shall we do with them?

684
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:52,239
Sir, will you not return these
to your friends?

685
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,974
Have you read Don Quixote?

686
00:40:58,014 --> 00:41:00,436
I have and found
myself the hero.

687
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:03,558
Be so good as to read once more
the capture of the windmills.

688
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:04,800
Chapter 13.

689
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,992
Windmills, remember,
if you fight with them...

690
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:12,386
may swing round their huge arms
and cast you down into the mire.

691
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,808
Or up among the stars.

692
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:17,771
Gentlemen.

693
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:19,122
Gentlemen.

694
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:20,353
Gentlemen.

695
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:22,415
You've done it, now.

696
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:23,666
You've made your fortune.

697
00:41:23,696 --> 00:41:24,877
He was willing to forget.

698
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:26,989
There you go again, growling.

699
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:29,271
Yesss,
this latest pose of yours,

700
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,883
ruining every opportunity
that comes you way,

701
00:41:31,913 --> 00:41:32,914
becomes exaggerated.

702
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:34,065
Very well, then, I exaggerate.

703
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,526
There are certain things
in this world

704
00:41:35,556 --> 00:41:36,918
a man does well
to carry to extremes.

705
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,530
Your precious independence.
Your white plume.

706
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,231
How do you expect
to succeed in life?

707
00:41:41,261 --> 00:41:42,222
What would you have me do?

708
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:44,414
Seek for the patronage
of some great man

709
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:47,707
and like a creeping vine
on a tall tree crawl upward

710
00:41:47,737 --> 00:41:49,349
where I cannot stand alone?

711
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:50,680
No, thank you.

712
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,714
Be a buffoon in the vile hope
of teasing out a smile on some cold face.

713
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:57,546
No, thank you.

714
00:41:57,886 --> 00:42:00,098
Eat a toad for breakfast
every morning.

715
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:03,371
Make my knees calloused.
Cultivate a supple spine.

716
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:05,162
Wear out my belly
groveling in the dust.

717
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:06,243
No, thank you.

718
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:10,727
With my left hand scratch the back
of any swine that roots up gold for me

719
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:14,761
while my right, too proud to know
his partner's business, takes in the fee.

720
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:15,772
No, thank you.

721
00:42:15,892 --> 00:42:19,665
Shall I use the fire God gave me
to burn incense all day long?

722
00:42:19,935 --> 00:42:20,876
No, thank you.

723
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:24,269
Struggle to insinuate my name
into the columns of the Gazette?

724
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:29,113
Calculate, scheme, be afraid?
Love more to make a visit than a poem?

725
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,856
Seek introductions, favors,
influences?

726
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:32,917
No, thank you.

727
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:36,140
No, I thank you, and
again I thank you.

728
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:46,198
But, to sing, to laugh, to dream,
to walk in my own way,

729
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:48,390
free with and eye
to see things as they are.

730
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:51,123
A voice that means manhood.

731
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:54,526
To cut my have
the right shoes.

732
00:42:54,566 --> 00:43:01,542
And a word, a yes, a no,
to fight, or write,

733
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:04,334
but never to make
a line I have not heard

734
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,675
in my own heart.

735
00:43:06,296 --> 00:43:08,278
To travel any
road under the sun,

736
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:10,680
under the stars,

737
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:15,424
nor care if fame or fortune
lie beyond the bourne.

738
00:43:16,275 --> 00:43:18,156
Yet, with all modesty to say,

739
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,739
my soul be satisfied
with flowers,

740
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,911
with weeds,

741
00:43:25,122 --> 00:43:26,754
with thorns, even,

742
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:30,857
but gather them in the one garden
you may call your own.

743
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:34,371
In a word, I'm too proud
to be a parasite.

744
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:37,393
And if mine intellect the germ
that grows towering to heaven

745
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:38,694
like the mountain pine

746
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,497
I stand not high, it may be,

747
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:44,389
but alone.

748
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:47,102
Alone, yes, but why
go about making enemies?

749
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:51,786
Watching other people
making friends... everywhere,

750
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:53,918
as a dog makes friends.

751
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:57,491
I mark the manner of
these canine courtesies,

752
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:02,715
and think, here comes,
thank heaven, another enemy.

753
00:44:02,755 --> 00:44:08,711
Yes, tell this to all the world,
and then to me say very softly

754
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:11,493
that she loves you not.

755
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,898
Let me be alone
for a moment.

756
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,011
Cyrano, wait.

757
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,723
Give us your story
of the fight.

758
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,364
Presently.

759
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:25,976
No, the story, now!

760
00:44:26,006 --> 00:44:27,937
Oh, let him alone.
There's time enough.

761
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,329
I want it now!

762
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,064
As an example for that young
tadpole sneaking out the doorway.

763
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:37,015
You, there.

764
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:42,800
Are you addressing me?

765
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:48,756
Yes, you flat-footed
Norman farmer.

766
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:53,460
You wish something of me?

767
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,942
Listen, Monsieur de... de... de
whatever your name is.

768
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:56,913
de Neuvillette!

769
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:59,225
Baron Christan de Neuvillette.

770
00:44:59,265 --> 00:45:01,367
Very well, de Neuvillette.

771
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:04,079
As you are a newcomer here,
you should know there is a

772
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:08,303
certain subject or object, if you prefer,
that is never mentioned among us.

773
00:45:08,343 --> 00:45:09,344
And that is...?

774
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,505
Look at me!

775
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:13,367
You understand?

776
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:14,678
You mean...?

777
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,101
Thus we never speak that word.

778
00:45:17,571 --> 00:45:20,403
To even breathe it is
to have to do with him.

779
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:24,777
He has exterminated several
whose mere tone of voice suggested...

780
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:28,941
Would you die before your time?
Just mention anything convex.

781
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:30,552
Or cartilaginous.

782
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:34,566
One word. One syllable.
One gesture. Nay, one sneeze.

783
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:37,358
And your handkerchief
becomes your winding sheet.

784
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:40,951
Captain.

785
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:42,323
Sir?

786
00:45:42,353 --> 00:45:46,126
What is the proper thing to do
when Gascons grow too boastful?

787
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:49,859
Prove to them that one may
be a Norman and still have courage.

788
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,140
I thank you.

789
00:45:57,376 --> 00:45:59,408
Come on, Cyrano, your story.

790
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:05,593
Now, let me see.
Where shall we begin?

791
00:46:06,504 --> 00:46:08,566
I followed with our host
to meet those scoundrels

792
00:46:08,606 --> 00:46:09,697
not knowing where
they might attack.

793
00:46:10,097 --> 00:46:12,399
No lamps in those narrow
back streets.

794
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,661
No moon in the sky.

795
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:17,283
Dark. Everything dark.

796
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:20,106
It was so dark, Mon Dieux,
you could not see beyond...

797
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:21,537
Your nose!

798
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:48,140
Who... is that... man... there?

799
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:51,473
A new recruit.

800
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:53,645
Arrived last week.

801
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:56,177
A recruit, eh?

802
00:46:56,978 --> 00:46:58,039
Ha, ha-.

803
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:01,422
His name is Christian de Neuvillette.

804
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,684
I see.

805
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:19,628
Very well.

806
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:22,590
As I was saying.

807
00:47:26,954 --> 00:47:28,055
It grew dark.

808
00:47:28,586 --> 00:47:31,308
You could not see
your hand before your eyes.

809
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:35,602
I marched on thinking our all for
the sake of one amateur poet

810
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:38,795
- Who wrote a verse whenever he took a..
- A nose full.

811
00:47:40,506 --> 00:47:41,907
whenever he took a notion.,

812
00:47:42,498 --> 00:47:44,740
and might antagonize
some dangerous man.

813
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,972
One powerful enough
to make me pay...

814
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:48,123
Through the nose!

815
00:47:48,153 --> 00:47:49,234
pay the piper!

816
00:47:49,554 --> 00:47:51,576
After all, I thought,
why am I putting in my..

817
00:47:51,616 --> 00:47:52,457
Nose!

818
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:55,319
putting in my oar in a quarrel
that was none of mine,

819
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:57,391
however now that I am here,
I may as well go through with it.

820
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:58,992
Come Gascon, do your duty.

821
00:47:59,032 --> 00:48:01,004
Suddenly a sword
flashed in the dark!

822
00:48:01,074 --> 00:48:01,965
I caught it fair...

823
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:02,966
On the nose!

824
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:05,288
on my blade!

825
00:48:05,328 --> 00:48:06,689
Before I knew it,
there I was...

826
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:07,850
Rubbing noses!

827
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,002
crossing swords with
harvard's joy once.

828
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:11,103
I had the bottom then...

829
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:12,064
A nosegay!

830
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:13,325
a monstrous crab tree.

831
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:16,037
He went down for as a wave.

832
00:48:16,247 --> 00:48:17,158
I charged...

833
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:18,760
Who was in the air hard.

834
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,620
at the two of them.

835
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,073
Another lunged,
and I parried...

836
00:48:22,113 --> 00:48:23,394
Through your nose!

837
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:25,486
Right out of here!
All of you go!

838
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:26,296
Leave me with him.

839
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,852
To my arms, sir.
You have courage.

840
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:46,074
- That pleases me.
- Why?

841
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:47,815
Come, do you not know
I am her brother?

842
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:48,856
Whose?

843
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,447
Hers. Roxane.

844
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,591
Brother?

845
00:48:55,462 --> 00:48:56,373
You?

846
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:58,354
Well, a distant cousin.
Much the same.

847
00:48:58,715 --> 00:49:00,656
- Then she has told you?
- Everything.

848
00:49:00,786 --> 00:49:02,888
- She loves me?
- Perhaps.

849
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,161
My dear sir, more than I can say.
I am honored.

850
00:49:06,201 --> 00:49:08,253
- Rather sudden.
- Oh, please, forgive me.

851
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,485
If you knew how
much I have admired you.

852
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:13,838
- Yes, yes, and all those noses.
- Please. I apologize.

853
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:16,901
Roxane expects a letter.

854
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:18,522
- From me?
- Yes, why not?

855
00:49:18,562 --> 00:49:19,403
Oh, No.

856
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:22,105
- Once I write, that ruins everything.
- Why?

857
00:49:22,145 --> 00:49:25,248
Because, any schoolboy can write
to her more gracefully than I.

858
00:49:25,818 --> 00:49:26,959
A fool!

859
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:30,793
- You did not attack me like a fool.
- Anyone can pick a quarrel.

860
00:49:30,973 --> 00:49:32,814
No, I'm never at loss
for words among men,

861
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:37,499
but with any women...
paralyzed... speechless, dumb.

862
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:39,841
I'm one of those
stammering idiots

863
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:41,512
who can not court a woman.

864
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:42,413
Really?

865
00:49:43,053 --> 00:49:44,945
As for myself,
it seems to me that

866
00:49:44,975 --> 00:49:48,548
given the opportunity,
and if I put my mind to it,

867
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,641
I could do that..
rather well.

868
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:54,123
Oh, is I had words to say
what I have here!

869
00:49:54,153 --> 00:49:55,705
If I were handsome
like you.

870
00:49:56,375 --> 00:50:00,038
Together, we could make
one mighty hero of romance.

871
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:01,590
If only I had your wit.

872
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:07,975
Borrow it, then.

873
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:09,417
What?

874
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:11,759
Tell me,

875
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,042
would you dare repeat to her
the words I gave you day by day?

876
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:18,695
Send to her
the letters that I write?

877
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:21,077
I mean, that Roxane
should have no disillusionment.

878
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:23,099
Come, shall we win her
both together?

879
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:24,079
For you?

880
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,251
- Why, Cyrano...
- Christian, why not?

881
00:50:26,281 --> 00:50:28,133
I... I'm afraid.

882
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:30,315
Afraid that when you
have her all alone, you will lose her.

883
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:32,707
Have not fear,
it is your self she loves.

884
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:34,208
Give her yourself.

885
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:39,963
Put into words,
my words... upon your lips.

886
00:50:40,414 --> 00:50:41,475
Will you?

887
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:44,327
Will you?

888
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,039
Does it mean
so much to you?

889
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,661
It means...

890
00:50:50,412 --> 00:50:53,365
It means a comedy,
a situation for a poet.

891
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:54,656
Come, shall we collaborate?

892
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:58,730
I'll be your cloak of darkness,
your enchanted sword,

893
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,642
your ring to charm
the fairy princess.

894
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:05,496
Think!
Is the prize not worth the danger?

895
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,299
My friend!

896
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,061
My friend.

897
00:51:13,212 --> 00:51:16,425
Take my heart.
I shall have it all the more.

898
00:51:16,675 --> 00:51:19,978
Plucking the flowers,
we will keep the plant in bloom.

899
00:51:20,128 --> 00:51:22,340
Thus do I love thee,
my darling.

900
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:26,004
Idiot.

901
00:51:26,244 --> 00:51:28,536
There are a dozen
ways to read that line.

902
00:51:28,576 --> 00:51:30,838
Can't you give it some meaning?
Any meaning!

903
00:51:30,868 --> 00:51:32,289
THUS do I love thee!

904
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,620
Thus do "I" love thee.

905
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,891
Thus do I LOVE thee.

906
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:37,273
Thus do I love THEE,
THEE, THEE.

907
00:51:38,925 --> 00:51:42,028
Who knows your smile
has known a perfect thing.

908
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:44,750
You are a white rose,
wherein love lies in ambush

909
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,532
for its natural prey.

910
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:50,115
In the garden of my heart,
you are the most...

911
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:52,036
eh, the most...

912
00:51:53,808 --> 00:51:56,110
fragrant blossom.

913
00:51:57,401 --> 00:52:01,144
As the tender sapling
thirsts for rain,

914
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:04,267
as the eagle seeks the sky,

915
00:52:04,397 --> 00:52:07,420
as the wave
hurtles toward the shore,

916
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,362
my heart yearns for you.

917
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,194
Good, good.

918
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:15,117
You know, you're beginning
to have a feel for words.

919
00:52:15,147 --> 00:52:18,389
- Words. I'm sick of words.
- Those are your weapons.

920
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,571
How else do you conquer?

921
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:20,511
Yes, but when, when?

922
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,573
They're fighting in the north, now.
You know that.

923
00:52:22,613 --> 00:52:24,074
The Regiment will be
called up any day,

924
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:25,225
and I've never
even kissed her.

925
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:28,328
Patience, my boy, patience.

926
00:52:28,368 --> 00:52:29,499
I've been patient.

927
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:32,672
Why, she sees the Compte de Guiche
as often as she does me.

928
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,516
Do you suppose
she's playing with me?

929
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:38,897
Making a fool of me?

930
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:41,280
Impossible.

931
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,611
How can you say?
How do you know?

932
00:52:43,612 --> 00:52:47,795
Cyrano, you have her confidence.
You could find out.

933
00:52:55,712 --> 00:52:57,103
Nonsense, I say.

934
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,856
Oh, very well.

935
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:01,607
I'll scout the terrain.

936
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:03,619
Listen, Cyrano,
intelligently, discreetly.

937
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:04,580
Yes.

938
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:05,761
With finesse.

939
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:11,936
And, uh, what do you think
of Christian after all these weeks?

940
00:53:12,046 --> 00:53:14,459
He is beautiful,
but he's brilliant.

941
00:53:14,499 --> 00:53:16,190
- And I love him.
- Good!

942
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,182
Uh, do you find him intellectual?

943
00:53:18,222 --> 00:53:20,033
- More so than you, even.
- Huh?

944
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:22,906
- Oh, I didn't mean.
- No, no, no, I am glad.

945
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:25,728
No man ever so beautifully
said those things.

946
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,341
Those pretty nothings
to everything.

947
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:32,224
Sometimes, he, He, he falls
into a reverie.

948
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:35,557
His inspiration.. fails.

949
00:53:36,498 --> 00:53:40,391
But, then all at once,
he will say something absolutely...

950
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:41,823
Ah!

951
00:53:41,853 --> 00:53:43,214
Really?

952
00:53:43,924 --> 00:53:45,366
How like a man!

953
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:48,679
You think because a man
has a handsome face he must be a fool.

954
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,251
Not necessarily.

955
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,874
Uh, he talks well about, uh,
matters of the heart?

956
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:58,888
He does not talk.
He rhapsodizes. He dreams.

957
00:53:58,928 --> 00:54:02,831
Only the other night he said to me,
extemporaneously, mind you.

958
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:03,692
Oh, of course.

959
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:07,135
'Take my heart.
I shall have it all the more.

960
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:11,238
'Plucking the flowers
we will keep the plants in bloom.'

961
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:13,210
Well?

962
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,012
Umm, passable.

963
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,493
He writes well?

964
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:18,565
Wonderfully, listen:

965
00:54:19,245 --> 00:54:21,998
'Knowing you have in store
more heart to give

966
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:24,650
- 'than I to find heart room...'
- The first he has too much heart,

967
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,892
then too little. Just how much heart
does he need?

968
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:28,233
You are teasing.

969
00:54:28,363 --> 00:54:29,364
You are jealous!

970
00:54:29,404 --> 00:54:30,185
Jealous?

971
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:30,936
Yes.

972
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:32,337
Poets are all alike.

973
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:36,160
Would you dare
criticize these lines?

974
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:41,605
'Only believe that unto you
my whole heart gives one cry.

975
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,979
'And writing, writes down
more than you receive.

976
00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:50,523
'Sending you kisses
through my fingertips.

977
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:54,536
'Lady, oh, read my letter
with your lips.'

978
00:54:55,857 --> 00:55:00,341
Yes, those last lines,
but he overwrites.

979
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:01,492
Listen to this.

980
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,523
Do you know
them all by heart?

981
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:03,594
Every one.

982
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,025
Well, I may call
that flattering.

983
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:05,836
He is a master.

984
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:08,378
- Oh, come..
- Yes, a master.

985
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,801
Huh, a master,
if you will.

986
00:55:13,773 --> 00:55:17,056
And, uh, when do you
bestow the laurel wreath?

987
00:55:17,076 --> 00:55:21,830
How many prodigies of poetry
must this new Hercules perform?

988
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,031
I do not know.

989
00:55:23,902 --> 00:55:28,126
My friend, you men own the world
and all that's in it.

990
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:34,541
Woman is at best a prize, a property
valued much the same as a horse or a dog,

991
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:38,565
unlike the pear and sheen of skin
and soundness of teeth and limb.

992
00:55:39,155 --> 00:55:44,430
Well, if I must be chattel,
then the terms shall be mine,

993
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:48,043
and the price according
to my own values.

994
00:55:48,073 --> 00:55:49,234
There.

995
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:52,027
I see.

996
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:56,450
Christian tells me
that you meet tonight.

997
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:01,785
What would you have him
speak about?

998
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,488
Oh, nothing,

999
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:06,109
and everything.

1000
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,723
I shall say, speak to me
of love in your own words.

1001
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:13,395
Improvise, rhapsodize.

1002
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:15,377
Be eloquent.

1003
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,129
But you will not tell him,
will you?

1004
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,861
Ah, perish the thought.

1005
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:22,964
Madame, Compte de Guiche.

1006
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,419
Madame.

1007
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:33,483
Monsieur.

1008
00:56:34,374 --> 00:56:35,375
Madame.

1009
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:40,879
Monsieur.

1010
00:56:50,047 --> 00:56:51,709
- Christian, quick.
- No.

1011
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,651
There's still time to learn your lines.
No.

1012
00:56:53,691 --> 00:56:56,383
I have some brilliant phrases for you,
brilliant, sensitive...

1013
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,124
No.

1014
00:56:57,774 --> 00:56:58,785
I'll have not more of it.

1015
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,877
Taking all my words, my sentences
all from you,

1016
00:57:00,907 --> 00:57:03,119
- making our love a little comedy.
- Don't you real...

1017
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:05,111
It was a game at first,
but now she cares.

1018
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:06,021
Huh?

1019
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:07,383
Thanks to you.
Uh.

1020
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,695
I'm not afraid any longer.
I'll speak for myself, now.

1021
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:10,555
Oh, undoubtedly.

1022
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,627
I will. You shall see!

1023
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,750
Besides, I know enough
to take a woman in my arms,

1024
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,511
and tonight, I will.

1025
00:57:20,714 --> 00:57:22,065
Christian!

1026
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:23,857
Thank you, my friend,
and goodbye.

1027
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:25,689
- Christian, I beg of you.
- Leave me!

1028
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,480
- You're making a grave error.
- Go away!

1029
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:31,193
So be it.

1030
00:57:36,959 --> 00:57:38,100
Christian.

1031
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,241
Roxane.

1032
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:41,993
I'm so glad you are early.

1033
00:57:43,094 --> 00:57:45,066
Let us stay out here
in the moonlight.

1034
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:47,157
It's so pleasant.

1035
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:50,300
Sit down.

1036
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:54,394
There, so.

1037
00:57:57,446 --> 00:58:00,459
Now, speak to me.

1038
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,151
I love you.

1039
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:05,013
Yes, speak to me of love.

1040
00:58:06,845 --> 00:58:10,078
I... love you.

1041
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:12,329
Now, be eloquent.
Be brilliant for me.

1042
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,631
Tonight of all nights.

1043
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:18,255
I love you... so.

1044
00:58:20,306 --> 00:58:24,330
You have your scene.
Now, improvise, rhapsodize.

1045
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,273
I love you...
very much!

1046
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:34,309
I ask for cream,
and you give me milk and water.

1047
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:39,203
Tell me firstly,
how you love me.

1048
00:58:39,243 --> 00:58:40,494
Very much!

1049
00:58:41,835 --> 00:58:43,156
Is that all you feel?

1050
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:46,079
Your throat, if only
I might kiss it.

1051
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:46,890
Christian!

1052
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:48,241
But, Roxane, I love you.

1053
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:49,582
Again.

1054
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,174
No, not again.
I do not love you.

1055
00:58:54,216 --> 00:58:55,267
That is better.

1056
00:58:56,108 --> 00:58:59,601
I... I adore you!

1057
00:58:59,771 --> 00:59:00,602
Oh!

1058
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:02,804
I know I grow absurd.

1059
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:05,606
And that distresses me as much
as if you had grown ugly!

1060
00:59:07,758 --> 00:59:11,651
Please. Gather your dreams
together into words.

1061
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:14,574
I... um, I...

1062
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:17,026
I know. You love me!
Good night!

1063
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:18,187
Oh, but wait, please!

1064
00:59:18,217 --> 00:59:19,278
I was going to say...

1065
00:59:19,308 --> 00:59:21,260
That you adore me.
Yes, I know that, too.

1066
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,472
- No, go away.
- I...

1067
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:46,642
A great success.

1068
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:48,494
Help me.

1069
00:59:48,524 --> 00:59:50,395
Not I.
Speak for yourself, my friend.

1070
00:59:50,435 --> 00:59:51,997
Why I... I can't.

1071
00:59:52,027 --> 00:59:54,819
Well, at least you know enough
to take a woman in your arms.

1072
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:56,461
Oh, Cyrano, please!

1073
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:58,392
What, and make your love
a little comedy.

1074
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:00,845
Cyrano, I cannot live
unless I win her back, now.

1075
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:01,695
This moment!

1076
01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:04,678
This moment. How the devil
am I to teach you now, this mo...

1077
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:05,729
Her window.

1078
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:08,481
- Help me, Cyrano, help me.
- Shhhh.

1079
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:11,594
It does seem fairly dark.

1080
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:12,575
Well? Well?

1081
01:00:14,286 --> 01:00:15,988
It is more than you deserve.

1082
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:18,810
must try out what can be done.

1083
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,841
Stand over there.

1084
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,307
Idiot, here, before the
balcony. I'll whisper you what to say.

1085
01:00:26,347 --> 01:00:28,188
- She'll hear..
- Shhhh. Call her.

1086
01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:30,500
Roxane.

1087
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:34,144
Roxane.

1088
01:00:38,508 --> 01:00:39,578
Who's calling?

1089
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:41,060
Christian.

1090
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,491
You again.

1091
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,243
I... had to tell you.

1092
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:46,164
No. Go away.
You tell me nothing.

1093
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:47,215
Please.

1094
01:00:47,255 --> 01:00:49,067
You do not
love me anymore.

1095
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:51,639
No, not anymore.

1096
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,171
I love you evermore,

1097
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:56,884
and everymore and more.

1098
01:00:58,025 --> 01:00:59,476
Oh, a little better.

1099
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:05,001
Love grows and struggles
like an angry child.

1100
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:07,463
Breaking my heart.

1101
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:09,915
His cradle...

1102
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:11,476
Better still.

1103
01:01:12,077 --> 01:01:14,239
But such a babe is dangerous.

1104
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:16,991
Why not have
smothered it newborn?

1105
01:01:18,733 --> 01:01:20,144
And so I do.

1106
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:22,146
And yet he lives.

1107
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:25,769
I found as you sha...
you shall find

1108
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:31,164
this newborn babe...
and infant Hercules!

1109
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:32,395
Good.

1110
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:33,786
Strong enough at birth

1111
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,468
to strangle
those two serpents

1112
01:01:36,879 --> 01:01:37,619
doubt and

1113
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:38,460
What?

1114
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,771
pride!

1115
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:41,313
Why, very good.

1116
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:44,756
Only, tell me why
you speak so haltingly.

1117
01:01:44,796 --> 01:01:47,458
Has your imagination
gone... lame?

1118
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,012
This grows too difficult.

1119
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:55,205
Your words tonight
hesitate, why?

1120
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:59,859
Through the warm summer gloom,
they grope in darkness

1121
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:01,580
toward the light of you.

1122
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:04,753
My words are
heavy with honey,

1123
01:02:04,793 --> 01:02:06,254
like returning bees.

1124
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:09,207
Yet they must fly so high.

1125
01:02:09,427 --> 01:02:11,039
Come nearer then.
Stand you on the bench.

1126
01:02:11,069 --> 01:02:11,899
No.

1127
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:13,090
Then I'll come down.

1128
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,011
NO!

1129
01:02:14,472 --> 01:02:16,283
And why so great a no?

1130
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:19,826
Let me enjoy the one
moment I ever...

1131
01:02:20,617 --> 01:02:24,020
My one chance
to speak to you... unseen.

1132
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:25,201
Unseen?

1133
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:26,652
Yes. Yes.

1134
01:02:26,983 --> 01:02:29,295
Night making all things
dimly beautiful

1135
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:30,686
one veil over us both.

1136
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,958
You need no eyes
to hear my heart.

1137
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:37,332
Oh, tonight, let it seem as if
I speak for the first time.

1138
01:02:38,072 --> 01:02:39,033
For the first time?

1139
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:39,924
Yes.

1140
01:02:40,865 --> 01:02:42,706
Your voice, even,
is not the same.

1141
01:02:42,736 --> 01:02:43,917
How should it be.

1142
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:45,379
I have another
voice tonight.

1143
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:48,181
My own, myself, daring!

1144
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:49,542
Why daring?

1145
01:02:49,572 --> 01:02:53,536
Because, what am I, what is any man
would he dare ask for you?

1146
01:02:53,566 --> 01:02:57,719
Therefore my heart has hidden behind
poetic words and tinsel phrases.

1147
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,582
But are they not sweet,
those pretty phrases?

1148
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,574
Not enough sweet
for you and me tonight.

1149
01:03:04,475 --> 01:03:06,187
You never spoke
to me like this.

1150
01:03:06,227 --> 01:03:08,459
I tell you, there comes
one moment, once,

1151
01:03:08,489 --> 01:03:10,751
and heaven help those
who pass that moment by,

1152
01:03:10,781 --> 01:03:13,063
when beauty stands
looking into the soul

1153
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:18,768
with grave, sweet eyes,
that sicken at pretty words.

1154
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:23,222
Yes... that is love.

1155
01:03:23,252 --> 01:03:23,972
Love.

1156
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:26,224
A love beyond breath,
beyond reason,

1157
01:03:26,254 --> 01:03:28,556
beyond love's own
power of loving.

1158
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,169
Your name is like a golden bell
hung in my heart,

1159
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:35,422
and when I think of you I tremble,
and the bell swings and rings,

1160
01:03:35,883 --> 01:03:42,859
Roxane! Roxane!
Along my veins... Roxane.

1161
01:03:45,982 --> 01:03:50,956
Yes... that is love.

1162
01:03:50,986 --> 01:03:52,758
Yes that is love.

1163
01:03:53,078 --> 01:03:55,910
That wind of terrible
and jealous beauty,

1164
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:01,195
that dark fire,
that soaring, blinding music.

1165
01:04:02,436 --> 01:04:04,688
Yet, you may take my happiness
to make you happier

1166
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:06,410
even though you
never know I gave it to you.

1167
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:12,705
Only let me hear, sometimes, all alone,
the distant laughter of your joy.

1168
01:04:13,746 --> 01:04:15,478
Do you begin
to understand a little?

1169
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:19,211
Can you feel my soul there
in the darkness breathe on you?

1170
01:04:20,242 --> 01:04:23,645
Oh, only tonight,
now I dare say these things.

1171
01:04:23,805 --> 01:04:26,417
I to you, and you hear them.

1172
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:29,670
It is my voice, mine, my own
that makes you tremble

1173
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,412
there in the green gloom,
above me, for you do tremble

1174
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,135
as a blossom among the leaves,
you tremble, and I can feel

1175
01:04:35,165 --> 01:04:36,696
all the way down along
this jasmine branch

1176
01:04:36,736 --> 01:04:40,730
whether you will unhold
the passion of you trembling.

1177
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,992
Yes, I do tremble.

1178
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:46,915
And I weep, and I love you,
and I am yours,

1179
01:04:46,945 --> 01:04:48,757
and you have made me thus.

1180
01:04:53,751 --> 01:04:55,292
I have done this to you.

1181
01:04:56,964 --> 01:04:58,425
I myself.

1182
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:04,290
Only let me ask
one thing more.

1183
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:05,952
I want a kiss!

1184
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:09,135
You ask me for...

1185
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:10,115
I... yes.

1186
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:11,316
That is to say...

1187
01:05:11,837 --> 01:05:12,828
I mean...

1188
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:14,509
You've gone too far.

1189
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:16,431
If she's willing, why
not make the most of it?

1190
01:05:16,471 --> 01:05:21,335
I, I ask.
I know I ask too much.

1191
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:23,487
Only one?

1192
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:25,699
Is that all?

1193
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:29,282
All?
How much more than all?

1194
01:05:29,322 --> 01:05:33,106
I know I startle you,
I... I ask, I ask you to refuse.

1195
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:34,277
Why? Why? Why?

1196
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:35,428
Christian, be quiet.

1197
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:36,509
What is that your say?

1198
01:05:36,549 --> 01:05:38,891
I am angry with myself,
because I know I go too far

1199
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:43,355
and so I say to myself,
CHRISTIAN, BE QUIET!

1200
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:45,386
Watch it, someone comes.

1201
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:56,276
Well, sir, I am looking
for the house of madame Roxane Robin.

1202
01:05:56,316 --> 01:06:00,550
This is not the house. That way.
To the right. Keep to the right.

1203
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,430
I thank you sir.

1204
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,983
I shall say my beads for you
to the very last bead.

1205
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:07,786
Win me that kiss?

1206
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:09,177
No!

1207
01:06:09,387 --> 01:06:10,889
Sooner or later.

1208
01:06:16,283 --> 01:06:17,625
So that is true.

1209
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:24,661
Sooner or later must be so, because,
she is young, and you are handsome.

1210
01:06:26,292 --> 01:06:32,367
Since it must be, I'd rather be
myself the cause, if it must be.

1211
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:41,796
Are you still there?

1212
01:06:41,826 --> 01:06:42,606
Yes.

1213
01:06:43,857 --> 01:06:45,879
We were speaking of...

1214
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,593
A kiss.
- A kiss.

1215
01:06:49,623 --> 01:06:51,484
And what is a kiss
when all is done?

1216
01:06:52,075 --> 01:06:54,227
A vow taken before
the shrine of memory.

1217
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:56,799
A rosy dot
over the "I" of loving.

1218
01:06:56,939 --> 01:06:59,801
- A secret whisper
to listen if the past.

1219
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:00,802
Shhh.

1220
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:03,875
A moment free to mortal
with a rush of wing from Ceden.

1221
01:07:03,905 --> 01:07:05,376
A sacrament of blossoms.

1222
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:10,411
A new song sung by two hearts
to an old, simple tune.

1223
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:11,592
Hush.

1224
01:07:11,622 --> 01:07:13,213
Why? What shame?

1225
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:18,478
No.
No shame.

1226
01:07:18,778 --> 01:07:19,939
Then come.

1227
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,852
Gather your sacred blossoms.

1228
01:07:24,423 --> 01:07:26,405
Your moment made immortal.

1229
01:07:26,415 --> 01:07:27,636
Climb!

1230
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,477
- But, climb?
- Many more!

1231
01:07:39,596 --> 01:07:40,947
Roxane.

1232
01:07:53,288 --> 01:07:56,972
Ah, Roxane.
I have won what I have wanted.

1233
01:07:57,522 --> 01:08:02,616
A feast of love,
and I am faint with hunger.

1234
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:08,251
Yet, I have something here
that is mine now,

1235
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,593
and was not mine before.

1236
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:14,006
I spoke the words
that won her.

1237
01:08:15,107 --> 01:08:21,713
She kisses my words.
My words... upon his lips.

1238
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,902
What, dear Father,
lost your way again?

1239
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,504
But, she lives here,
Madame Robin.

1240
01:08:33,534 --> 01:08:35,065
Oh, I thought
you said, Rolen?

1241
01:08:35,095 --> 01:08:37,087
No, r..o..b..I..n, Robin.

1242
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:38,268
Oh, Robin, I see.

1243
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:40,330
I'm too old
to chase wild geese

1244
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,321
- my feet...
- Oh, what a shame,

1245
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:45,164
however, I'm sure there's someone at home.

1246
01:08:47,396 --> 01:08:48,106
What is it?

1247
01:08:48,136 --> 01:08:51,820
Yeah, I'm looking for
the young lady, Madam Rolen

1248
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,091
Rolen?

1249
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:54,332
Robin!

1250
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:57,304
Madame!
A letter for you.

1251
01:08:57,845 --> 01:08:59,326
Yes, yes, I heard.

1252
01:09:00,227 --> 01:09:01,008
Cyrano.

1253
01:09:01,048 --> 01:09:03,340
Uh, passing by cousin,
I saw this light.

1254
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:07,593
Uh, some matter
profitable to the soul.

1255
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:09,815
A very noble lord gave it to me.

1256
01:09:10,016 --> 01:09:10,906
What is it?

1257
01:09:11,987 --> 01:09:14,369
My regiment has been
ordered to the front.

1258
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,761
<i>I cannot allow you
to delay any longer.</i>

1259
01:09:16,801 --> 01:09:19,093
<i>This simple old monk,
who knows nothing,</i>

1260
01:09:19,123 --> 01:09:21,466
<i>will marry us tonight.
My love, Antoine de Guiche.</i>

1261
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:26,160
Father, this letter
concerns you.

1262
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:31,214
"Madame, the Cardinal
will have his way,

1263
01:09:31,254 --> 01:09:32,815
"although against your will.

1264
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:35,438
"That is why I am
sending this to you,

1265
01:09:35,468 --> 01:09:37,760
"by a most holy man.

1266
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,452
"Intelligent, discreet.

1267
01:09:40,873 --> 01:09:43,955
"You will communicate
to him our order to perform

1268
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:48,459
"here and at once
the rite of holy matrimony.

1269
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:53,213
"You and Christian will be
married privately in your house.

1270
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:57,067
"Be resigned to the
Cardinal's command,

1271
01:09:57,107 --> 01:09:59,239
"who sends herewith
his blessings.

1272
01:09:59,269 --> 01:10:01,370
"Your very humble,
and etcetera..."

1273
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:04,063
Oh, this is terrible.

1274
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,166
Oh, you're to be
the, uh...

1275
01:10:07,206 --> 01:10:08,807
I am to be the bridegroom.

1276
01:10:11,269 --> 01:10:13,551
Uh, look here.
A postscript.

1277
01:10:14,102 --> 01:10:19,646
"Give to the monastery,
in my name 120 pieces of gold."

1278
01:10:19,677 --> 01:10:21,398
One hundred and twenty...

1279
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,862
Oh, a worthy lord.
A very worthy lord.

1280
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:29,365
Daughter, resign yourself.

1281
01:10:29,405 --> 01:10:31,417
I am resigned.

1282
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,846
The Guiche is coming, too.
Don't let him enter.

1283
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,077
Not let him enter?

1284
01:10:43,117 --> 01:10:45,139
Until we're married, please.

1285
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:03,695
Me?

1286
01:11:03,735 --> 01:11:05,727
- Why, where did you come from?
- The moon.

1287
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:06,698
- You...
- From the moon.

1288
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:08,059
I have just returned
from the moon.

1289
01:11:08,089 --> 01:11:09,790
- The fellow's mad!
- Like a bomb, I tell you,

1290
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,502
- I fell from the moon!
- Your feet must...

1291
01:11:11,532 --> 01:11:12,823
I say THE MOON!

1292
01:11:12,853 --> 01:11:14,955
- Very well, if you say so.
- Thank you.

1293
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:15,986
Raving mad.

1294
01:11:18,038 --> 01:11:20,230
- Where am I?
- My dear sir!

1295
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,461
- What place is this?
What country?

1296
01:11:21,491 --> 01:11:23,552
- Please, let me pass.
- This face, good heavens!

1297
01:11:23,593 --> 01:11:26,095
Maul, a robber.
Where am I?

1298
01:11:26,135 --> 01:11:30,218
- A lady is waiting for me.
- Oh, this is Paris, huh?

1299
01:11:30,258 --> 01:11:31,009
You fool!

1300
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:32,190
Dear old Paris.

1301
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:35,143
Excuse my appearance.
I arrived by the last thunderbolt.

1302
01:11:35,183 --> 01:11:37,365
A trifled singed
as I passed through the ether.

1303
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:38,716
Monsieur!

1304
01:11:38,756 --> 01:11:39,476
Sir?

1305
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:41,148
That will do, now. I wish...

1306
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:42,999
I know, you wish to look for
my own list of nature for moons

1307
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,221
and happiness and character
of it's surface, if any.

1308
01:11:45,251 --> 01:11:46,463
I desire no such thing, I...

1309
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:47,463
Of course not.

1310
01:11:50,346 --> 01:11:51,737
You wish to know
by what mysterious

1311
01:11:51,767 --> 01:11:52,978
means I reached the moon.

1312
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:55,280
Well, a very secret affair of state,

1313
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:59,184
but confidentially
a new invention of my own.

1314
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,605
Drunk, two ways.
Well a man..

1315
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:03,467
Oh, no. In truth I have
my choice of several inventions.

1316
01:12:03,497 --> 01:12:04,318
Uh?

1317
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:08,272
Yes, several ways
to violate the virgin sky.

1318
01:12:08,302 --> 01:12:09,633
Several?

1319
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:10,934
Several.

1320
01:12:10,964 --> 01:12:14,947
As, for instance, smoke
having a natural tendency to rise,

1321
01:12:14,978 --> 01:12:19,481
blow in a globe
enough to raise me.

1322
01:12:19,511 --> 01:12:20,733
Yes, that makes one.

1323
01:12:20,763 --> 01:12:24,216
Again, I might construct a rocket
in the shape of a HUGE locust

1324
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:28,249
driven by impulses up within
a saltpeter from the rear

1325
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:31,492
and thus speed upwards,
like, thus!

1326
01:12:31,702 --> 01:12:32,703
Yes, another?

1327
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:36,396
Finally, seated on an iron plate,
hurl a magnet into the air.

1328
01:12:36,426 --> 01:12:39,259
The iron follows.
I catch the magnet.

1329
01:12:39,299 --> 01:12:42,782
Throw it again, and
so proceed indefinitely.

1330
01:12:42,812 --> 01:12:44,914
Excellent, and
which did you adopt?

1331
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:49,828
Why none of them.

1332
01:12:50,419 --> 01:12:51,810
Yet another.

1333
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,201
Which was...?

1334
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,971
Guess.

1335
01:13:05,332 --> 01:13:06,843
Ahhh, I can't!

1336
01:13:07,564 --> 01:13:08,574
Try.

1337
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:11,457
Interesting idiot, this.

1338
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:24,028
Have you guessed it yet?

1339
01:13:24,048 --> 01:13:25,449
Why, no, what is it?

1340
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:33,366
Alas, you will never know,
but no matter.

1341
01:13:33,406 --> 01:13:35,968
You are free and
they are bound in wedlock.

1342
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:38,511
I drunk that voice,
and that nose, Cyrano!

1343
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:41,213
Cyrano. This very moment
they have exchanged vows.

1344
01:13:41,253 --> 01:13:41,964
Who?

1345
01:13:47,328 --> 01:13:49,040
My sincere compliments.

1346
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:52,413
You, also, my traveler in space.

1347
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:55,315
My Lord, the heads of Capathieu
and Joyce have joined together.

1348
01:13:55,355 --> 01:13:56,266
Quite so!

1349
01:13:57,397 --> 01:14:01,681
Madame, kindly bid
your... husband farewell.

1350
01:14:01,711 --> 01:14:04,193
Your regiment leaves tonight, sir.
Report at once!

1351
01:14:05,124 --> 01:14:06,845
But, the Cadets are not called.

1352
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:09,378
They are, indeed, and
under my command.

1353
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:12,611
Out there we may
have an accounting.

1354
01:14:12,771 --> 01:14:15,663
Somehow, that news
fails to disquiet me.

1355
01:14:16,694 --> 01:14:18,726
Here are the orders.
Baron, deliver this.

1356
01:14:20,037 --> 01:14:21,188
Christian!

1357
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:27,203
The bridal night
is not so near.

1358
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,947
Somehow that news
fails to disquiet me.

1359
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,892
Baron, you have your orders.

1360
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:55,098
Farewell, Roxane.

1361
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:58,060
Take care of him, for me.
Promise me never to let him

1362
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:58,971
do anything dangerous.

1363
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:00,462
I will do my best.
I cannot promise.

1364
01:15:00,492 --> 01:15:02,544
I thought you brave always.
Make him be careful.

1365
01:15:02,584 --> 01:15:03,645
Yes, yes, I'll try.

1366
01:15:03,685 --> 01:15:05,417
Be sure to keep him
warm and dry!

1367
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:06,728
Yes, if possible.

1368
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,400
Have him write to me
every single day!

1369
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,672
That, I promise you.

1370
01:15:58,443 --> 01:15:59,164
Halt!

1371
01:16:20,713 --> 01:16:21,563
Uh!

1372
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,852
The situation
is simple, gentlemen.

1373
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:11,027
We have besieged Arras.
The Prince of Spain has besieged us.

1374
01:17:11,247 --> 01:17:13,649
Consequently, we
are surrounded.

1375
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:16,612
- A fine war. Where
the besiegers are beseiged

1376
01:17:16,642 --> 01:17:17,713
and starve to death.

1377
01:17:17,753 --> 01:17:19,684
Yes, but the Marshal has
devised a brilliant plan

1378
01:17:19,724 --> 01:17:21,176
for bringing in food
this very night.

1379
01:17:21,206 --> 01:17:22,157
Now, see here.

1380
01:17:22,197 --> 01:17:23,938
Spare us the details, Colonel.

1381
01:17:23,968 --> 01:17:26,520
Merely inform us
when the food arrives.

1382
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,083
True, we are hungry.
But why blame me?

1383
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:31,024
I'm only your Colonel.

1384
01:17:32,406 --> 01:17:34,617
Oh, yes, I know
you disprove of me.

1385
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:36,649
Call me courtier, politician.

1386
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,792
Well, I can afford you little hates.

1387
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,444
My conduct under fire
is well known.

1388
01:17:42,474 --> 01:17:44,886
It was only yesterday
I repelled a Spanish attack.

1389
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:46,788
Pouring my men down
like an avalanche.

1390
01:17:46,968 --> 01:17:48,430
I, myself lead the charge.

1391
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,052
And your white scarf?

1392
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:51,853
Cyrano!

1393
01:17:55,606 --> 01:17:56,867
And your white scarf?

1394
01:17:56,877 --> 01:17:58,208
Eh, you heard that episode?

1395
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:01,841
Yes, I was so far in advance
I was in danger of being captured.

1396
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,303
But I thought quickly,
took off and flung away

1397
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:06,025
the scarf that marked
my military rank.

1398
01:18:06,155 --> 01:18:08,887
And so being inconspicuous
escaped among my own force,

1399
01:18:09,148 --> 01:18:11,990
rallied them, returned,
and won the day.

1400
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,241
What do you say to that?

1401
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:16,294
Still, an officer does not like
to resign the privilege of being a target.

1402
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:19,437
How pleasant for you
that you are denied that privilege.

1403
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:21,398
Pleasant?
Lend me your scarf.

1404
01:18:21,428 --> 01:18:23,320
With your permission I shall
lead the first charge tonight

1405
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,641
wearing it over my shoulder.

1406
01:18:24,681 --> 01:18:25,472
What bluster.

1407
01:18:25,502 --> 01:18:27,384
You're safe making that offer,
and you know it.

1408
01:18:27,424 --> 01:18:30,376
My scarf lies on the
river bank between the lines.

1409
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:33,319
A spot swept by artillery.
Impossible to reach alive.

1410
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,460
Yes.

1411
01:18:39,284 --> 01:18:40,175
Here.

1412
01:18:43,488 --> 01:18:44,268
Thank you.

1413
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,772
This bit of white is
what I need to make a signal.

1414
01:18:49,593 --> 01:18:51,134
I was hesitating.

1415
01:18:51,715 --> 01:18:53,497
You have decided me.

1416
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,793
- Stand or I'll fire!
- Hold you fire.

1417
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:02,434
There's a man down
there running away.

1418
01:19:02,474 --> 01:19:04,486
Yes, a Spaniard.

1419
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:08,099
But very useful as a spy
to both sides.

1420
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,271
As I was about
to tell you.

1421
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:12,894
The Marshal has withdrawn
more than half our forces here.

1422
01:19:12,934 --> 01:19:14,985
Fortunately, the Spaniards
do not know that.

1423
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:18,268
Oh, yes, they do now,
and they will attack tonight.

1424
01:19:18,308 --> 01:19:20,040
At this point.

1425
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,322
Your revenge, eh?

1426
01:19:22,352 --> 01:19:24,474
I make not great
pretense in loving you.

1427
01:19:24,574 --> 01:19:27,977
But since you gentlemen
esteem yourselves invincible,

1428
01:19:28,007 --> 01:19:30,519
the bravest of the brave,
and all that.

1429
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,930
Why need we be personal.

1430
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,522
The Marshal needs
a diversion, and I serve him

1431
01:19:34,553 --> 01:19:36,855
in choosing as I chose.

1432
01:19:37,025 --> 01:19:39,257
As you can see, Captain,
the great thing is to gain time.

1433
01:19:39,287 --> 01:19:40,888
To hold until the Marshal returns.

1434
01:19:40,998 --> 01:19:42,800
And to gain time?

1435
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:49,195
You will all be so kind
as to lay down your lives.

1436
01:19:57,443 --> 01:19:58,534
Christian?

1437
01:19:58,574 --> 01:19:59,634
Yes.

1438
01:20:02,797 --> 01:20:03,968
Roxane?

1439
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:07,101
I should like to say
farewell to her

1440
01:20:07,131 --> 01:20:09,423
with my whole
heart for her to keep.

1441
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:13,457
I have taken the liberty of...

1442
01:20:22,134 --> 01:20:22,965
But, wait.

1443
01:20:25,127 --> 01:20:26,038
This little spot.

1444
01:20:26,478 --> 01:20:27,219
Spot?

1445
01:20:27,259 --> 01:20:27,959
Yes.

1446
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,411
A tear.

1447
01:20:31,362 --> 01:20:32,073
Is nothing.

1448
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:34,725
A poet while he writes
is like a lover in his lady's arms,

1449
01:20:34,755 --> 01:20:36,927
believing his imagination,
everything seems real.

1450
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,579
There's half the charm
of writing.

1451
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:41,871
Now, I made this letter
so pathetic, that,

1452
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:45,164
while I was writing it,
I wept.

1453
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:45,985
You wept?

1454
01:20:46,526 --> 01:20:49,468
Why, yes, because
it is a little thing to die,

1455
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:54,593
but not to see her,
that is terrible.

1456
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:59,777
I shall never...,
you will never...

1457
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:01,579
Give me that.

1458
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,393
- Halt. Who goes there.
- On the service of the King.

1459
01:21:15,941 --> 01:21:19,234
- The King!
- Fall in...

1460
01:21:28,432 --> 01:21:29,533
Good evening.

1461
01:21:29,563 --> 01:21:31,455
On the King's service, you?

1462
01:21:41,324 --> 01:21:43,776
- Gentlemen,
- What are you doing here?

1463
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,228
- We heard rumors at home
you were hungry,

1464
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:47,739
so we came prepared.

1465
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:52,433
The Spaniards adored the fare,
but they missed the fowl!

1466
01:22:00,901 --> 01:22:04,964
But why did you come here
into this, this danger?

1467
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:07,366
They said in Paris
there was no fighting.

1468
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:11,570
Besides, it was your own fault.

1469
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,729
Think of the
letters you have written me.

1470
01:22:22,009 --> 01:22:24,471
How many times!
Every day!

1471
01:22:24,511 --> 01:22:25,642
Every day?

1472
01:22:25,682 --> 01:22:26,783
Of course.

1473
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:29,526
And each one
more wonderful than the last.

1474
01:22:29,566 --> 01:22:32,789
All this, for a few absurd love letters.

1475
01:22:32,829 --> 01:22:36,021
Hush. Absurd?
Your letters... no, never.

1476
01:22:37,002 --> 01:22:40,706
Every one was like hearing your voice
that night in the dark. Remember?

1477
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:44,569
Like your arms around me.
I read them over and over.

1478
01:22:44,609 --> 01:22:48,402
Every page was like
a petal fallen from you soul.

1479
01:22:48,442 --> 01:22:51,335
Like the light
and the fire of a great love.

1480
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:54,007
- Sweet and strong and true.
- Sweet.

1481
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,268
Strong.

1482
01:22:55,579 --> 01:22:56,479
True?

1483
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:01,083
Oh, my Christian.

1484
01:23:01,684 --> 01:23:04,416
I came here to ask forgiveness.

1485
01:23:05,657 --> 01:23:07,379
It is time to be forgiven.

1486
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:09,951
Now, when we
may die so soon.

1487
01:23:11,783 --> 01:23:13,384
Forgive me for being
light and vain

1488
01:23:13,414 --> 01:23:15,576
and loving you only
because you were handsome.

1489
01:23:15,606 --> 01:23:17,238
- For now...
- Now?

1490
01:23:18,088 --> 01:23:19,950
I love you for yourself.

1491
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,102
For what you are.

1492
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:23,353
Roxane.

1493
01:23:23,923 --> 01:23:27,016
How you must have suffered.
For you saw how frivolous I was.

1494
01:23:27,046 --> 01:23:29,318
And to be loved
for the mere costume,

1495
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:32,111
for the poor, casual
body you went about in.

1496
01:23:32,771 --> 01:23:35,644
To a soul like yours,
that must have been torture.

1497
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:36,414
No.

1498
01:23:40,027 --> 01:23:41,168
I understand.

1499
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:43,961
You cannot perfectly
believe in me,

1500
01:23:43,991 --> 01:23:45,562
a... a love like this...

1501
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:47,124
I want no love like this.

1502
01:23:47,354 --> 01:23:49,055
I want love only for...

1503
01:23:49,085 --> 01:23:51,127
Only for what every
woman sees in you.

1504
01:23:51,738 --> 01:23:53,069
I can to better than that.

1505
01:23:53,099 --> 01:23:55,281
No, it... it was best before.

1506
01:23:56,402 --> 01:23:58,133
You do not
altogether know me.

1507
01:23:58,584 --> 01:24:00,305
I was a child.

1508
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:01,696
I'm a woman now.

1509
01:24:02,297 --> 01:24:04,769
- If... if you were less handsome,
- No.

1510
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:08,182
unattractive, ugly even,
I should love you, still.

1511
01:24:08,823 --> 01:24:09,954
Do you mean that?

1512
01:24:10,564 --> 01:24:11,805
I do mean that.

1513
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:13,076
Ugly?

1514
01:24:13,157 --> 01:24:14,257
Even then.

1515
01:24:14,938 --> 01:24:16,109
Now, are you happy?

1516
01:24:21,534 --> 01:24:22,715
Yes.

1517
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:23,566
What is it?

1518
01:24:24,256 --> 01:24:26,758
Nothing, only, Cyrano...

1519
01:24:27,789 --> 01:24:28,900
Cyrano.

1520
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,163
he has something
to tell you.

1521
01:24:34,255 --> 01:24:35,276
Where are you going?

1522
01:24:35,316 --> 01:24:38,769
I... will... return... in a moment.

1523
01:24:47,286 --> 01:24:48,137
Cyrano.

1524
01:24:48,738 --> 01:24:50,569
Your wife, sir,
she goes with me?

1525
01:24:50,599 --> 01:24:51,430
No, sir, she remains.

1526
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:52,761
There is still time
for her to escape.

1527
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:53,732
She stays!

1528
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:54,883
Very well.

1529
01:24:54,913 --> 01:24:57,045
Someone give me a musket.
I stay here also.

1530
01:24:57,515 --> 01:24:58,736
Sir, you show courage.

1531
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:00,988
What, shall I run away,
and leave a woman?

1532
01:25:01,549 --> 01:25:03,421
Colonel, my compliments, sir.

1533
01:25:04,902 --> 01:25:05,913
What of Roxane?

1534
01:25:05,943 --> 01:25:06,974
Wait.

1535
01:25:07,454 --> 01:25:08,965
Well, what is it?
You look so...

1536
01:25:10,937 --> 01:25:12,689
She does not love me.

1537
01:25:13,099 --> 01:25:15,421
- You think not?
- She loves you.

1538
01:25:15,451 --> 01:25:17,743
- No.
- She loves only my soul.

1539
01:25:17,773 --> 01:25:18,484
- No.
- Yes!

1540
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:21,256
That means you.
And you love her.

1541
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:23,418
- I?
- I see. I know.

1542
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:26,431
You wrote her,
everyday, every day!

1543
01:25:26,941 --> 01:25:28,152
- Perfectly simple.
- Simple?

1544
01:25:28,182 --> 01:25:29,824
For a month,
we've been blockaded here.

1545
01:25:29,864 --> 01:25:31,465
How did you send
all those letters?

1546
01:25:31,495 --> 01:25:32,626
Before daylight
I managed...

1547
01:25:32,656 --> 01:25:34,197
To face death
everyday.

1548
01:25:34,948 --> 01:25:36,079
You love her.

1549
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,321
Yes.

1550
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:46,028
Tell her so.

1551
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:47,389
- No.
- Why not?

1552
01:25:47,489 --> 01:25:50,432
Why?
Look at me.

1553
01:25:50,732 --> 01:25:53,564
She would love me
if I were ugly.

1554
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:56,967
- She said that?
- Yes. Now, go to her.

1555
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,561
Nonsense. Do not
believe any such madness.

1556
01:26:00,591 --> 01:26:02,883
Go back to her.
You never will be ugly.

1557
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:03,964
Go!
It is you she loves.

1558
01:26:04,004 --> 01:26:05,024
That is what
we shall see.

1559
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:05,995
No, no!

1560
01:26:06,035 --> 01:26:07,637
- Let her chose between us.
- No.

1561
01:26:07,677 --> 01:26:09,669
- Tell her everything.
- Why do you torture me?

1562
01:26:09,709 --> 01:26:12,861
Shall I ruin your happiness,
because I was born with a pretty face?

1563
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,374
Am I to ruin yours,
because I happen to have power

1564
01:26:15,414 --> 01:26:16,915
to say what you perhaps feel?

1565
01:26:16,945 --> 01:26:19,077
- Tell her!
- Don't drive me too far!

1566
01:26:19,117 --> 01:26:21,379
- I'm tired of being my own rival.
- Hard to know.

1567
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,641
My secret marriage, that
can be annulled, I expect.

1568
01:26:23,671 --> 01:26:25,963
I want her love
for the poor fool than I am,

1569
01:26:26,033 --> 01:26:27,194
or not at all.

1570
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:30,267
Oh, I'm going through with this.
I'll know one way or the other.

1571
01:26:31,047 --> 01:26:33,459
Now, go! Tell her.

1572
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,971
Let her chose one of us.

1573
01:26:35,751 --> 01:26:36,962
It will be you.

1574
01:26:37,853 --> 01:26:39,515
I hope so.

1575
01:26:51,265 --> 01:26:52,016
Captain!

1576
01:26:54,768 --> 01:26:56,299
The Spanish fires are going out.

1577
01:26:59,232 --> 01:27:00,363
It begins.

1578
01:27:00,423 --> 01:27:02,345
I need a scout. Where's Cyrano.

1579
01:27:02,695 --> 01:27:03,486
Captain.

1580
01:27:04,056 --> 01:27:04,947
Let me go.

1581
01:27:04,987 --> 01:27:07,699
No, my boy, Cyrano knows
the terrain. He knows their lines.

1582
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:09,761
So do I.
Please, allow me.

1583
01:27:12,373 --> 01:27:14,285
Very well.
We must know from which

1584
01:27:14,325 --> 01:27:17,028
direction the advance comes.
Their weight and numbers.

1585
01:27:17,058 --> 01:27:17,778
I understand.

1586
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:31,010
Roxane.

1587
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,681
Cyrano.

1588
01:27:32,711 --> 01:27:34,163
Christian thinks...

1589
01:27:35,704 --> 01:27:37,425
Christian thinks you
ought to know that...

1590
01:27:37,455 --> 01:27:38,476
But I do know.

1591
01:27:39,007 --> 01:27:41,089
He still doubts what I
just told him, just now.

1592
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:42,100
I saw that.

1593
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,803
Yes, but, was it true,
what you told him just now?

1594
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,144
It was true.

1595
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:50,517
I said that I should love him,
even if he were...

1596
01:27:51,268 --> 01:27:52,829
The word comes
hard before me?

1597
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,113
Say it, I shall
not be hurt.

1598
01:27:57,623 --> 01:27:58,874
Ugly?

1599
01:27:58,934 --> 01:28:00,386
Even, then
I should love him.

1600
01:28:01,757 --> 01:28:02,948
Disfigured.

1601
01:28:02,978 --> 01:28:04,129
Or disfigured.

1602
01:28:04,739 --> 01:28:07,882
Even... grotesque.

1603
01:28:07,912 --> 01:28:09,614
How could he
every be grotesque,

1604
01:28:10,074 --> 01:28:11,215
ever to me?

1605
01:28:11,255 --> 01:28:13,847
But, you could love him so,
as much as?

1606
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:15,058
Yes, and more.

1607
01:28:15,589 --> 01:28:16,590
Roxane...

1608
01:28:17,611 --> 01:28:18,531
What is it?

1609
01:28:19,823 --> 01:28:20,873
Are they fighting?

1610
01:28:23,526 --> 01:28:24,787
What is happening?

1611
01:28:24,957 --> 01:28:26,288
The Spaniards advance,

1612
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,210
but there is time.

1613
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,652
- Where is Christian?
- At the parapet.

1614
01:28:31,102 --> 01:28:32,173
Oh, of course.

1615
01:28:33,214 --> 01:28:35,036
What is it
that you wish to tell me?

1616
01:28:35,066 --> 01:28:36,427
Roxane,

1617
01:28:37,098 --> 01:28:39,980
believe me this is difficult,
and for once I lack words.

1618
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:44,624
Christian asked me to...

1619
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:46,146
He told me...

1620
01:28:55,344 --> 01:28:56,525
Christian!

1621
01:29:00,108 --> 01:29:01,279
To your places, gentlemen.

1622
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,441
Is he dead?

1623
01:29:03,481 --> 01:29:04,572
No, but dying.

1624
01:29:04,612 --> 01:29:05,973
I will not let him!

1625
01:29:10,187 --> 01:29:12,849
Cyrano... did you?

1626
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,931
Yes, my friend.
I have told her.

1627
01:29:16,672 --> 01:29:17,773
She loves you.

1628
01:29:19,165 --> 01:29:20,516
Roxane.

1629
01:29:20,566 --> 01:29:21,897
Yes, my darling.

1630
01:29:24,349 --> 01:29:25,650
Christian!

1631
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:27,702
He is not dead?

1632
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,164
Yes.

1633
01:29:39,983 --> 01:29:41,234
Time you must go, now.

1634
01:29:41,664 --> 01:29:44,206
Really, he is dead.

1635
01:29:44,236 --> 01:29:46,088
No one else
knew him but you.

1636
01:29:46,599 --> 01:29:47,980
Was he not a hero?

1637
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,051
Yes, Roxane.

1638
01:29:49,871 --> 01:29:51,693
A heart deeper
than we knew.

1639
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:53,284
Yes, Roxane.

1640
01:29:53,364 --> 01:29:57,668
A poet.
A soul magnificently tender.

1641
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:02,022
Yes, Roxane.

1642
01:30:03,203 --> 01:30:05,105
But he is dead now.

1643
01:30:08,438 --> 01:30:09,599
Why, so am I.

1644
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:13,432
For I am dead
and my love mourns for me

1645
01:30:13,472 --> 01:30:14,923
and does not know.

1646
01:30:16,565 --> 01:30:17,906
Will never know.

1647
01:30:21,409 --> 01:30:22,410
Take her away quickly.

1648
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:24,882
Wait.

1649
01:30:26,023 --> 01:30:27,604
A letter over his heart.

1650
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:36,853
I have two deaths
to avenge, now,

1651
01:30:37,483 --> 01:30:41,066
Christian's... and my own.

1652
01:31:07,870 --> 01:31:08,700
Fire!

1653
01:31:18,699 --> 01:31:21,241
Surrender or you die!

1654
01:33:18,474 --> 01:33:19,475
Ah!

1655
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:28,153
We fought. We died.
We fought again.

1656
01:33:28,293 --> 01:33:31,305
Who are these men who are
so fond of death, one Spaniard cried.

1657
01:33:31,385 --> 01:33:32,987
On and on, they came.

1658
01:33:33,117 --> 01:33:35,759
Then, when all seemed lost,
we heard the trumpets

1659
01:33:35,799 --> 01:33:38,402
of our returning troops.
The battle was ours!

1660
01:33:39,242 --> 01:33:42,605
Ah, you have been fortunate,
Ms. De Bergerac, you have lived!

1661
01:33:42,645 --> 01:33:47,429
While we, we waste our youth.
There is no war and not hope for any.

1662
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,441
No hope for any?

1663
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:52,784
My fellow, I just realize,
we are both fools.

1664
01:33:53,195 --> 01:33:56,117
But mine is the greater folly,
for I am an older fool.

1665
01:33:56,738 --> 01:34:00,891
What is more...
Everything I told you was a lie.

1666
01:34:06,126 --> 01:34:08,258
Another satire
for the Gazette?

1667
01:34:08,288 --> 01:34:08,988
Yes.

1668
01:34:09,399 --> 01:34:12,061
Another glove flung
in the face of power?

1669
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:13,983
Oh, why do you
do it, Cyrano?

1670
01:34:14,013 --> 01:34:16,445
- Why do you attack...
- Stupidity?

1671
01:34:16,465 --> 01:34:19,768
Deceit? Corruption?
I'm too old to change.

1672
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:22,570
I'm an old dog
with nothing left but his teeth.

1673
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,173
Ah, but teeth can be pulled.
That can be painful.

1674
01:34:29,036 --> 01:34:33,180
That insolent wretch.
That scoundrel de Bergerac.

1675
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,782
This time he's gone too far.
I swear it.

1676
01:34:35,812 --> 01:34:37,393
He's signed his death warrant.

1677
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:40,336
And who will deliver it?

1678
01:34:40,886 --> 01:34:43,649
His sword is still very
powerful, my friend.

1679
01:34:44,009 --> 01:34:45,841
There are may ways
a man can die.

1680
01:34:46,601 --> 01:34:48,163
Who knows?

1681
01:34:48,493 --> 01:34:50,044
He may meet
with an accident.

1682
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:52,186
Soon.

1683
01:35:02,866 --> 01:35:04,687
But, uh, tell me, Madame.

1684
01:35:04,807 --> 01:35:09,461
How long will you continue
to remain here, forever in mourning?

1685
01:35:10,302 --> 01:35:11,203
Forever.

1686
01:35:11,693 --> 01:35:13,715
Was Christian all that?

1687
01:35:14,406 --> 01:35:16,037
If you knew him
you would not ask.

1688
01:35:16,588 --> 01:35:18,790
His last letter
is still in my heart.

1689
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:23,414
And, uh, Cyrano?
Do you see him often?

1690
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:27,887
Every week. My old friend
takes the place of my Gazette.

1691
01:35:28,268 --> 01:35:29,969
He brings me all the news.

1692
01:35:30,730 --> 01:35:33,592
Every Saturday under
that tree out there.

1693
01:35:33,633 --> 01:35:35,724
I wait for him embroidering.

1694
01:35:36,085 --> 01:35:38,897
The hour strikes.
I need not turn to look.

1695
01:35:39,227 --> 01:35:42,730
At the last stroke,
I hear his cane tapping the walk.

1696
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,093
His satires have made
him many enemies.

1697
01:35:45,743 --> 01:35:48,405
But, they still fear
that sword of his.

1698
01:35:48,996 --> 01:35:50,798
No one dare touch him.

1699
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:52,339
Hm, that may be so.

1700
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:56,833
It is not violence
I fear for him,

1701
01:35:56,873 --> 01:36:01,237
but solitude, poverty.
Old gray Decembers

1702
01:36:01,267 --> 01:36:04,029
stealing on wolf's feet
into his darkened room.

1703
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:06,912
It seems to me he's
worn the same old coat

1704
01:36:06,942 --> 01:36:08,293
for many months, now.

1705
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:10,425
Eh, that is nothing
strange in this world.

1706
01:36:10,465 --> 01:36:12,507
You need not pity
him overmuch.

1707
01:36:12,547 --> 01:36:15,619
He lives his life,
his own life his own way,

1708
01:36:15,659 --> 01:36:18,992
thought, word and deed free.

1709
01:36:19,142 --> 01:36:20,303
My Lord Duke.

1710
01:36:20,444 --> 01:36:24,557
Oh, yes, I know.
I have all. He has nothing.

1711
01:36:25,068 --> 01:36:30,873
Nevertheless, today,
I should be proud to shake his hand.

1712
01:36:31,053 --> 01:36:32,704
Ah, well, adieu.

1713
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:35,006
Will I ever see you again?

1714
01:36:35,046 --> 01:36:36,678
Come whenever you like.

1715
01:36:36,718 --> 01:36:38,319
Then, you have forgiven me.

1716
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:40,391
I am here.

1717
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:44,094
Do you know?
When a man wins

1718
01:36:44,134 --> 01:36:48,468
everything in this world,
when he succeeds too much,

1719
01:36:48,508 --> 01:36:52,912
he feels, somehow,
a thousand small displeasures

1720
01:36:52,952 --> 01:36:57,286
with himself, whose whole sum
is not quite remorse

1721
01:36:57,326 --> 01:37:04,302
but rather a sort of vague
disgust, dry illusions, pained regrets.

1722
01:37:04,602 --> 01:37:07,465
Yes, now and then,
I envy your Cyrano.

1723
01:37:07,815 --> 01:37:09,597
The sentiment
does you honor.

1724
01:37:18,094 --> 01:37:23,028
Madame, I must tell you,
it is true that no one has yet

1725
01:37:23,068 --> 01:37:25,240
dared to attack
your friend Cyrano.

1726
01:37:25,551 --> 01:37:30,135
Nevertheless, at the theater
last night, I heard some things.

1727
01:37:31,015 --> 01:37:32,477
Keep him at home all you can.

1728
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:36,090
Tomorrow when you see him,
tell him to be careful.

1729
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:37,891
I thank you.

1730
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:51,914
Good night, Ragueneau.

1731
01:37:51,954 --> 01:37:53,895
Cyrano, you not leaving?

1732
01:37:53,925 --> 01:37:55,807
You will not have
dinner here with me?

1733
01:37:55,837 --> 01:37:57,639
My regrets. I have a magnificent

1734
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:01,232
roast waiting for me, a rare wine,
a gift from my publisher.

1735
01:38:01,272 --> 01:38:02,673
Fine, to be sure.

1736
01:38:03,434 --> 01:38:06,276
Uh, have you seen
Moliere's new play?

1737
01:38:06,316 --> 01:38:07,047
No.

1738
01:38:07,127 --> 01:38:08,438
Heh, ah, well...

1739
01:38:08,478 --> 01:38:09,369
What is it?

1740
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:10,250
Well, he...

1741
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:11,040
Speak.

1742
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,013
He stole a scene
from you, word for word.

1743
01:38:14,043 --> 01:38:15,935
You know, "What the devil
was he doing there?"

1744
01:38:15,965 --> 01:38:16,725
That one.

1745
01:38:16,765 --> 01:38:17,836
He stole it, bodily.

1746
01:38:17,866 --> 01:38:20,098
Well, he showed
good taste.

1747
01:38:20,138 --> 01:38:21,820
It, uh, played well?

1748
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,252
Oh, beautifully. They
laughed and laughed.

1749
01:38:24,282 --> 01:38:25,613
Oh, how they laughed.

1750
01:38:26,054 --> 01:38:27,365
Moliere has genius.

1751
01:38:28,175 --> 01:38:29,817
Christian had good looks.

1752
01:38:30,978 --> 01:38:32,419
With me, it was
always thus.

1753
01:38:34,861 --> 01:38:36,052
Good night, my friend.

1754
01:38:50,865 --> 01:38:51,876
Hold, there.

1755
01:38:51,986 --> 01:38:52,777
You!

1756
01:38:54,478 --> 01:38:55,679
Are you addressing me?

1757
01:38:55,709 --> 01:38:57,821
Yes, you, Monsieur
of the long nose.

1758
01:38:57,931 --> 01:38:58,832
Insolence.

1759
01:38:59,122 --> 01:39:00,824
- Foulmouthed scribbler.
- What?

1760
01:39:00,854 --> 01:39:02,275
- Lair, plagiarist!
- Liar.

1761
01:39:46,444 --> 01:39:47,365
Doctor.

1762
01:39:48,806 --> 01:39:50,137
Why pretend?

1763
01:39:50,427 --> 01:39:51,789
It is very grave.

1764
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,381
Keep him quiet
at all costs.

1765
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:57,384
If he attempts
to rise, he will die.

1766
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:58,695
Shhhh.

1767
01:40:02,108 --> 01:40:02,818
Thank you.

1768
01:40:20,434 --> 01:40:22,075
Monsieur.

1769
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:22,866
Ah, Sister.

1770
01:40:29,912 --> 01:40:31,263
What is the matter
with you?

1771
01:40:33,395 --> 01:40:34,816
Shall I tell you
something, Sister?

1772
01:40:35,457 --> 01:40:39,390
Yesterday, Friday, mind you,
I ate meat again.

1773
01:40:40,852 --> 01:40:41,923
Yes, I know.

1774
01:40:42,273 --> 01:40:44,004
That is why you
are so pale.

1775
01:40:44,044 --> 01:40:46,857
Please come to me
to the refectory before you go.

1776
01:40:46,887 --> 01:40:49,179
I'll make you a great
bowl of hot soup.

1777
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:50,560
Of course, of course.

1778
01:40:51,010 --> 01:40:52,882
You're quite reasonable today.

1779
01:40:52,922 --> 01:40:55,054
Perhaps you'll convert me.

1780
01:40:55,094 --> 01:40:57,196
Oh, no! Not for the world.

1781
01:40:57,856 --> 01:40:59,628
Why, now I think of it,
that is so.

1782
01:41:00,008 --> 01:41:03,501
You, bursting with holiness,
and yet you never preach.

1783
01:41:04,412 --> 01:41:05,703
Astonishing.

1784
01:41:06,004 --> 01:41:08,045
And now I shall astonish you.

1785
01:41:08,636 --> 01:41:13,060
I'm going to let you
pray for me tonight, at Vespers.

1786
01:41:14,781 --> 01:41:17,654
Absolutely struck dumb, eh?

1787
01:41:21,507 --> 01:41:24,139
I did not wait for you
to say I might.

1788
01:41:33,898 --> 01:41:36,420
Now may the devil admire
me if never hope to see

1789
01:41:36,460 --> 01:41:38,542
the end of that embroidery.

1790
01:41:38,572 --> 01:41:42,415
After 14 years,
late for the first time.

1791
01:41:42,456 --> 01:41:45,528
Yes.
Yes, maddening.

1792
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:50,463
I was detained by
a visitor. Most unexpected.

1793
01:41:51,133 --> 01:41:52,644
An old friend of mine.

1794
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:55,817
At least a very
old acquaintance.

1795
01:41:55,857 --> 01:41:57,309
Did you tell him
to go away?

1796
01:41:57,969 --> 01:41:59,400
For the time being, yes.

1797
01:41:59,430 --> 01:42:04,265
I said excuse me,
I see that it's Saturday,

1798
01:42:04,615 --> 01:42:07,197
I have a previous
engagement.

1799
01:42:07,237 --> 01:42:08,618
One I cannot miss.

1800
01:42:09,319 --> 01:42:11,341
Even for you.

1801
01:42:12,252 --> 01:42:14,313
Come back an hour from now.

1802
01:42:14,424 --> 01:42:18,177
Your friend will have to wait.
I shall not let you go till dark.

1803
01:42:19,248 --> 01:42:23,982
Perhaps a little before dark,
I must go.

1804
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:28,096
Oh, then tell me now
the court news. My Gazette.

1805
01:42:29,407 --> 01:42:33,210
Ah, yes, well, let me see.

1806
01:42:35,372 --> 01:42:39,866
Saturday, 19th, the King
fell ill after eight helpings of

1807
01:42:39,906 --> 01:42:41,197
grape marmalade.

1808
01:42:41,908 --> 01:42:45,351
Grape marmalade will
no longer be served at court.

1809
01:42:47,222 --> 01:42:52,046
Sunday, the royal pulse
is now normal.

1810
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:56,971
Monday, everyone was
talking about the success

1811
01:42:57,001 --> 01:42:58,642
of Moliere's new play.

1812
01:42:59,873 --> 01:43:05,158
Tuesday, the King fell ill
after six helpings of marone glacee.

1813
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,181
Marone glacee will no
longer be served at court.

1814
01:43:10,763 --> 01:43:14,756
Wednesday, the Compte de Firske
spoke to Madame de Monte Glas.

1815
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:18,440
She said... no.

1816
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:26,517
Thursday... Nothing.

1817
01:43:26,557 --> 01:43:29,649
Friday, Madame de Monte Glas
said yes.

1818
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:37,877
Saturday, 25th...

1819
01:43:38,527 --> 01:43:39,598
Cyrano!

1820
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:43,091
What is it?
Cyrano!

1821
01:43:47,745 --> 01:43:50,388
- Oh, no, no, it is nothing.
- What?

1822
01:43:50,838 --> 01:43:53,290
The old wound at Arras
sometimes...

1823
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:56,073
- My poor friend.
- No, no, no, it is nothing.

1824
01:43:56,923 --> 01:43:58,445
It will soon be gone.

1825
01:44:00,106 --> 01:44:04,090
There. 'Tis gone.

1826
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:07,583
We all have
our old wounds.

1827
01:44:08,123 --> 01:44:13,027
I have mine here,
under this faded scrap of writing.

1828
01:44:14,489 --> 01:44:16,450
It's hard to read now.

1829
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:20,454
All for the blots
and tears.

1830
01:44:20,484 --> 01:44:21,675
His letter?

1831
01:44:22,596 --> 01:44:25,769
Did you not promise me,
that someday you would let me read it?

1832
01:44:26,209 --> 01:44:31,474
- This letter? You wish...?
- I do wish it... today.

1833
01:44:41,783 --> 01:44:43,364
Open it and read.

1834
01:45:08,856 --> 01:45:13,821
"Farewell, Roxane,
because today I die."

1835
01:45:13,851 --> 01:45:15,162
Aloud?

1836
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:19,315
"I know that it will be today,
my own dearly beloved.

1837
01:45:20,797 --> 01:45:24,070
"Yet, my heart still so heavy
with love I have not told.

1838
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:30,505
"And I shall die without telling you.

1839
01:45:31,076 --> 01:45:34,919
"No more shall my eyes
drink the sight of you like wine,

1840
01:45:35,410 --> 01:45:38,362
"never more with a look
that is a kiss,

1841
01:45:38,923 --> 01:45:41,615
"follow the sweet
grace of you."

1842
01:45:41,655 --> 01:45:43,587
How you read it.
His letter.

1843
01:45:43,627 --> 01:45:45,488
"I remember now the way you have

1844
01:45:45,528 --> 01:45:49,472
"of pushing back a lock of hair
with one hand from your forehead,

1845
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:52,465
- "and my heart cries out..."
- His letter!

1846
01:45:52,505 --> 01:45:54,196
"cries out and keeps crying."

1847
01:45:54,236 --> 01:45:57,439
- You read it so...
- "Farewell, my dear, my dearest,"

1848
01:45:57,469 --> 01:45:59,851
- In a voice...
- "my own heart's own,"

1849
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:03,434
- "my own treasure," - In
such a voice! - "my... love."

1850
01:46:03,464 --> 01:46:06,347
Yes, I remember hearing long ago.

1851
01:46:06,697 --> 01:46:11,421
"I am never away from you.
Even now I shall not leave you.

1852
01:46:12,322 --> 01:46:15,575
"In another world, I shall
still be that one who loves you,

1853
01:46:15,605 --> 01:46:19,328
"loves you beyond measure,
beyond..."

1854
01:46:28,406 --> 01:46:30,358
But, how can you read it now?

1855
01:46:33,651 --> 01:46:37,044
And all those 14 years
he has been the old friend

1856
01:46:37,074 --> 01:46:38,885
who came to me to be amusing.

1857
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:42,408
- Roxane.
- It was you.

1858
01:46:43,149 --> 01:46:44,120
No, no, Roxane, no.

1859
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:47,343
And I might have know it every time
that I heard you speak my name.

1860
01:46:47,373 --> 01:46:50,936
- No, it was not I. -
It was you! - I swear.

1861
01:46:51,706 --> 01:46:54,058
- The letters. That was you.
- No.

1862
01:46:54,389 --> 01:46:58,212
- And the dear foolish words. That was you.
- No.

1863
01:46:58,442 --> 01:47:02,546
- And the voice in the dark. That was you.
- On my honor!

1864
01:47:02,586 --> 01:47:06,429
And the soul.
It was all you.

1865
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:08,441
I never loved you.

1866
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:10,113
Yes, you loved me.

1867
01:47:10,233 --> 01:47:12,004
Even now you love me.

1868
01:47:12,925 --> 01:47:14,877
No!

1869
01:47:14,917 --> 01:47:17,189
And twice you're great to know.

1870
01:47:17,219 --> 01:47:20,031
Oh, no, no, my own dear love,
I love you not.

1871
01:47:22,613 --> 01:47:25,116
Why were you silent
for so many years?

1872
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:27,137
All the while.

1873
01:47:27,368 --> 01:47:30,390
Every night, and every day,
he gave me nothing.

1874
01:47:31,161 --> 01:47:32,402
You knew that.

1875
01:47:33,003 --> 01:47:35,965
You knew in that letter
lying on my breast.

1876
01:47:37,226 --> 01:47:38,517
Your tears.

1877
01:47:39,869 --> 01:47:42,060
You knew they
were your tears.

1878
01:47:45,684 --> 01:47:47,565
The blood was his.

1879
01:47:48,666 --> 01:47:49,497
Cyrano!

1880
01:47:51,989 --> 01:47:53,621
Here! He's here.

1881
01:47:53,691 --> 01:47:54,972
Oh, what recklessness.

1882
01:47:55,112 --> 01:47:55,873
No.

1883
01:47:55,903 --> 01:47:56,733
I knew it!

1884
01:47:56,793 --> 01:47:59,746
- Madame he has killed himself coming here.
- No. Shh.

1885
01:48:00,006 --> 01:48:01,528
That drink is, what is it?

1886
01:48:01,598 --> 01:48:04,820
Nothing. I did not
finish my Gazette.

1887
01:48:05,911 --> 01:48:09,284
Saturday, 26th, an hour
or so before dinner

1888
01:48:09,855 --> 01:48:14,659
Ms. De Bergerac died,
foully murdered.

1889
01:48:15,009 --> 01:48:16,791
Cyrano, what have
they done to you?

1890
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:18,863
How fate loves a jest.

1891
01:48:19,303 --> 01:48:22,326
Behold me ambushed,
taken unawares.

1892
01:48:22,486 --> 01:48:28,161
My noble foe, a lackey.
My battlefield, a gutter.

1893
01:48:28,821 --> 01:48:30,283
It seems too logical.

1894
01:48:30,703 --> 01:48:32,375
They have missed everything,

1895
01:48:33,155 --> 01:48:34,627
even my death.

1896
01:48:35,667 --> 01:48:37,289
Sisters! Sisters!

1897
01:48:37,329 --> 01:48:40,692
No, do not go away.
I may not be here when you return.

1898
01:48:41,372 --> 01:48:43,104
You shall not die.

1899
01:48:43,144 --> 01:48:44,805
I love you.

1900
01:48:44,835 --> 01:48:46,757
No, my lady,
it's not in the story.

1901
01:48:47,448 --> 01:48:49,249
When beauty said
I love you to the beast

1902
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:52,342
all his ugliness changed
and dissolved, like magic.

1903
01:48:52,903 --> 01:48:56,726
But, you see,
I am still the same.

1904
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,788
And I have
done this to you.

1905
01:48:58,828 --> 01:48:59,979
You? Why no.

1906
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:01,420
All my fault, mine!

1907
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:02,681
On the contrary.

1908
01:49:03,422 --> 01:49:06,444
I have never know womanhood
in its sweetness, but for you.

1909
01:49:08,086 --> 01:49:10,118
My mother did not
like to look at me.

1910
01:49:11,419 --> 01:49:12,900
I never had a sister.

1911
01:49:14,251 --> 01:49:20,507
Later, I feared those sweethearts
with mockery behind her smile.

1912
01:49:21,898 --> 01:49:25,531
But, because of you,
I have had across my life

1913
01:49:26,312 --> 01:49:29,985
one whispering, silken gown.

1914
01:49:32,167 --> 01:49:34,589
I never loved but
one man in my life.

1915
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:38,072
I have lost him, twice.

1916
01:49:42,966 --> 01:49:47,290
I would not have you mourning
any less that good, noble Christian.

1917
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:51,974
But, perhaps, I ask only this,

1918
01:49:53,506 --> 01:49:55,778
when the great cold
gathers around my bones,

1919
01:49:57,179 --> 01:50:02,003
you may give a double
meaning to your widow's weeds.

1920
01:50:03,324 --> 01:50:09,620
The tears you let fall for him,
may for a little, be my tears.

1921
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,462
Oh, my love!

1922
01:50:15,825 --> 01:50:17,827
No, not here.
Not lying down.

1923
01:50:18,147 --> 01:50:20,729
Let no one help me.
No one need help me.

1924
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:26,865
It is coming.

1925
01:50:27,696 --> 01:50:30,898
I feel already shod with marble.

1926
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:33,391
Gloved with lead.

1927
01:50:34,171 --> 01:50:36,143
Very well,
let the old fellow come now.

1928
01:50:36,633 --> 01:50:39,045
He shall find me
on my feet.

1929
01:50:41,117 --> 01:50:42,569
Sword in hand.

1930
01:50:42,609 --> 01:50:43,559
Cyrano!

1931
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:45,341
He'd delirious.

1932
01:50:46,212 --> 01:50:47,453
I see him now.

1933
01:50:47,493 --> 01:50:48,254
He grins.

1934
01:50:48,294 --> 01:50:50,205
He is looking at my nose!

1935
01:50:50,245 --> 01:50:51,276
That skeleton.

1936
01:50:52,057 --> 01:50:53,188
You there.

1937
01:50:53,428 --> 01:50:54,129
Who are you?

1938
01:50:55,019 --> 01:50:56,411
A hundred against one, eh?

1939
01:50:56,761 --> 01:50:59,483
I know them now,
my ancient enemies.

1940
01:50:59,518 --> 01:51:00,424
Falsehood, there!

1941
01:51:00,704 --> 01:51:01,936
There, Predujice!

1942
01:51:01,956 --> 01:51:03,567
Compromise, Cowardice.

1943
01:51:04,047 --> 01:51:06,630
What's that?
Surrender? No, never!

1944
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,901
Never!

1945
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:10,293
Ah, you too, Vanity.

1946
01:51:10,513 --> 01:51:13,656
I knew you would
overthrow me in the end.

1947
01:51:13,686 --> 01:51:16,789
No, I fight, I fight on,
I fight... ow!

1948
01:51:26,027 --> 01:51:28,038
All my laurels
you have riven away.

1949
01:51:29,780 --> 01:51:31,261
And my roses.

1950
01:51:32,432 --> 01:51:35,095
Yet, in spite of you,
there is one crown

1951
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:36,476
I made away with me.

1952
01:51:36,516 --> 01:51:39,879
And tonight when I
enter before God,

1953
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:46,645
my salute shall sweep away
the stars from the blue threshold.

1954
01:51:47,816 --> 01:51:52,750
One thing without stain,
unspotted from the world,

1955
01:51:53,751 --> 01:51:59,626
in spite of doom, mine own,
and that is...

1956
01:52:02,739 --> 01:52:07,443
my... white... plume...
