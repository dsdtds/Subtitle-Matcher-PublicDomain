1
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,419
What are you getting so mushy about?

2
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,259
Well, I'm glad you asked me.

3
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,859
I couldn't keep it from you much longer.

4
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,299
- What?
- Life's biggest moment.

5
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,179
I'm going to be married.

6
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,259
You don't believe me.

7
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,659
Yes, I don't be...

8
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,939
What do you mean, you don't believe me?

9
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,779
Didn't I just tell you
I was going to be married?

10
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,459
- Who to?
- Why, a woman, of nurse!

11
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,579
Did you ever hear
of anybody marrying a man?

12
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,539
- Sure.
- Who?

13
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,379
My sister.

14
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
This is no time for levity.

15
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,379
She's the sweetest girl you ever saw.

16
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Well-read, traveled all over the world...

17
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,059
loved by everyone.

18
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,060
And she's mine. All mine.

19
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,899
Well, what do you think of her?

20
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,900
What do"levity' mean?

21
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,899
Levity is a synonymum!

22
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,900
You know what a synonymum is!

23
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,419
A synonymum is... synomum...

24
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,179
Hello?

25
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,299
- What are you doing?
- Somebody knocking on the phone.

26
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,179
That's levity!

27
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,219
Hello, Mr Levity?

28
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,220
Go to the door!

29
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,059
“Hello, Mr Levity"!

30
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,819
Hmm!

31
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,779
Letter for Mr Hardy!

32
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,780
- Thank you, Mr Levity.
- Y“, sir!

33
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,979
It's from her.

34
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,859
Wait till I find my glasses.

35
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,620
You read it, I can't find them.

36
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,939
“My dear, darling, precious Oliver... “

37
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,260
'..as I sit writing this note to you,
with your picture in front of me...

38
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,259
'I have decided

39
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,459
"that all is ever between us...

40
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,539
"for I love another.

41
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,540
'Your one-time sweetheart, Jean.“

42
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,060
What's the matter?

43
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,220
Didn't you read it?

44
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Yeah, but I wasn't listening.

45
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,579
Give me that letter!

46
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Wait a minute, there's some more.

47
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Have you seen my glasses?

48
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,019
"B.S.

49
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,059
“It's best we never see each other again.

50
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,779
“Jeanie Weenie.“

51
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,099
What does she mean, 'B.s.'?

52
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,699
“Big Sucker', I guess.

53
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Now I see it all“.

54
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,580
You vampire.
You wrecker of men's happiness!

55
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,700
And I learned about women from you!

56
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,380
Come, Stanley.

57
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,299
Where are you going?

58
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,819
We're going where we can forget.

59
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,339
What do you mean we've got to forget?

60
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,579
None of your business! Come on!

61
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,580
I haven't got anything to do with...

62
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,659
Ten-hull

63
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Present arms!

64
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,659
Lower arms!

65
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,379
Guards!

66
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Close gates!

67
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,019
- Sir, the new recruits.
- Numbers, holler!

68
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,979
- One!
- Two!

69
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,939
- Three!
- Four!

70
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,219

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,419
- Nine!

73
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,779

00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,499

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,859

78
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,660
21!

79
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,140
21!

80
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,099
Come come, what is your number?

81
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,379
Hollywood-4368.

82
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,339
Silent-l

83
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,299
This is no plan for levity.

84
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,820
- What's your name?
- This is my friend Mr Laurel, Admiral.

85
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,979
My name is Hardy. Oliver Norville Hardy.

86
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,139
Joined up together, eh?

87
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,219
- Yes, ma'am.
- Er, we're buddies.

88
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,299
Well, you “mainly are a sorry looking pair.

89
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,659
- We're not sorry.
- No, sir, we're just discouraged.

90
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,660
What on earth ever prompted you
to join the Legion?

91
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,419
- Well, Brigadier, it was like this...
- I came here to help him forget.

92
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,939
Forget? Forget what?

93
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,059
Well? Well?

94
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,099
I forgot.

95
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,619
You forgot what you come here to forget?

96
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,419
Well, we'll see that you don't forget
what you're here for!

97
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,659
We'll start whipping them
into shape tomorrow!

98
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Yes, sir!

99
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,819
Attention! Right fan

100
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,979
Fall out! One-two-one!

101
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,299
What's the matter?

102
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,539
Can we get a room by ourselves?

103
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,540
Certainly. I'll get you a room with a bath

104
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,260
I. Mia bambina. L'unico amor mio.

105
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,620
You didn't ought to have done it, baby.

106
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,579
“She's traveled all over the world.

107
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,419
“Loved by everyone.

108
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,420
“And she's mine. All mine.“

109
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,739
- That settles it.
- What?

110
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,179
- Come on.
- Where?

111
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,180
None of your business. Come on!

112
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,259
Well?

113
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,499
If you please, sir,
we'd like to rectify a small mistake.

114
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,779
- Mistake?
- Yes, sir.

115
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,419
Sine. Joining your army
we find that we've been disillusioned.

116
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,739
- Disillusioned?
- Yes, sir, disillusioned.

117
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,740
You see, sir, it was like this -
we came here because of a woman.

118
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,659
Hm. 9996 of us do. What of it?

119
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Well, most luckily, sir, we found out
just in time that this woman wasn't worth it.

120
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,299
No, sir. You know what she did...?

121
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,899
And we've decided to leave
before it's too late.

122
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,939
So you've decided to leave, have you?

123
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,940
Yes, sir. If any mail comes for us
send it to this address.

124
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,779
What do you think this is, a picnic?

125
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,419
You're here, and here you're going to shy.

126
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,779
This is the army of forgotten souls.

127
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,299
Men come to this Godforsaken spot
to forget and be forgotten!

128
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Men came here to accept the hardships
of the desert and the wasteland!

129
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,340
To be without food! Without water!
And to laugh at it all!

130
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,699
Your comrades will fall
bleeding and dying at your side.

131
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,700
And you're here to stay until
the rattle in your dying throats relieves you!

132
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,899
Back to your quarters.

133
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,939
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

134
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,859
Back to your quarters!

135
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Goodbye.

136
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,259
Captain Schultz!

137
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,579
Take that. New recruits
and put them through their pee-c!

138
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,979
- Now, sir?
- At on... do you hear me? At on“!

139
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Yes, sir!

140
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,220
Open the gates! Open the gates!

141
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,419
Company halt!

142
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Well, well. Why, my comrades,
you're looking better already.

143
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,180
Get them to bed early. Thursday, tomorrow,
we'll take them out for a real march.

144
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,019
- Yes, sir!
- Mr General?

145
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,619
Couldn't you make that Friday?
I can't get up in the mornings...

146
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,539
Silent-l
Right turn!

147
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,739
Oh...

148
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,019
I'm so tired, my feet are killing me.

149
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,899
Oh.

150
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,419
Oh...

151
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,580
That feels so good.

152
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,059
Oh...

153
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,939
Ohh...

154
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,259
Scratch my back.

155
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,219
Scratch your own back,
I've got troubles of my own.

156
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Oh...

157
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,659
The gates! The gates! The gates!

158
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Come in!

159
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,179
What news from our ally?

160
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Bad news, sahib. The Riffs are preparing
to make an attack on Fort Arid.

161
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,739
- How strong are they?
- They number more than the hairs

162
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,779
in the head of Mohammad.

163
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,780
We must have reinforcements
or the post is doomed.

164
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,459
You may go.

165
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,059
- Marching orders, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,219
Take every man -
you leave at one. For Fort Arid.

167
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,459
- Not the new recruits, sir?
- The experience will do them good.

168
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,019
- But they're tired...
- That is the time to train men,

169
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,339
show them what
the hardships of the desert mean.

170
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,340
- Spare no man but return here quickly.
- Y“, my colonel.

171
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,939
- Ollie.
- What?

172
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,379
I feel just like Jeanie Weenie.

173
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,539
What do you mean,
you feel just like Jeanie Weenie?

174
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,939
I feel like I've traveled all over the world.

175
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Go to sleep!

176
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,579
Attention! Full marching equipment!

177
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,259
Fall in! Come on!

178
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,019
If he's gonna make us march...

179
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,779
Ow!

180
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,899
Attention!

181
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,539
Right shoulder, arms!

182
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,259
Right fan!

183
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,619
Forward march!

184
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,980
- What's the idea?
- I couldn't find my trousers!

185
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,780
Stop that squalling!

186
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Hey! What have you got your hat
turned like that for?

187
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,699
Keeps the sun out of the eyes.
Try it, it's great.

188
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,700
That's a great idea.

189
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,419
Company... halt!

190
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,619
Company ham!

191
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,859
Get back in your plans!

192
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,499
Get in your lines!

193
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Fall in! Do you hear?

194
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,899
- Where's your equipment?
- Eh?

195
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,939
Where's your equipment?

196
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,579
- I wrapped it up in yours.
- Oh.

197
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,219
- Why, you can't...
- All right, march!

198
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,939
But he's got my... l

199
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,179
You! Get in the line!
And stay there!

200
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,659
- You... l
- Fall in there!

201
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Get a move on!

202
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,819
Sandstorm approaching, men!

203
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,820
- Indian file!
- Indian file!

204
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Bring him in.

205
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,419
I am the commander. What do you want?

206
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Does the commander
wish to surrender new or not?

207
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,859
Surrender? Hm!

208
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,899
Not while I have a man left.

209
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,659
Hm.

210
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,660
By the gran of Allah,
this is your last char]...

211
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,099
You have my answer. Go!

212
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,859
Then the bones
of your beloved Legionnaires

213
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,939
will lie bleaching in the desert sand.

214
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,139
Steady, men!

215
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,099
He's under a flag of truce.

216
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,100
Now, then... go back to your scavengers!

217
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,699
You can expect anything at any time.

218
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Comrades... Comrades, it...
it looks like the end.

219
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,379
Unless help arrives we are doomed.

220
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,380
Caught like... like rah in a trap.

221
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,499
Oh... Oh, why don't they come?

222
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,899
Why don't they come?

223
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,579
"Step. Step. Step. Step-

224
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,580
One, two, three, four,
step. Step. Step. Step. Step-

225
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,219
One, two, three, four, step, step...

226
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,220
Company, halt!

227
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,379
Don't do that! It may be another trick!

228
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,379
- Who's there?
- Legionnaires!

229
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,659
They're here. They're here! Relief at last!

230
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Open the gates! Open the gates!

231
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,380
Pardon me, is this Fort Arid?

232
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,379
Right shoulder, arms!

233
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,259
Forward march!

234
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,019
Company, halt!

235
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,779
Why... where are the rest of the men?

236
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,379
Well, you see, Commodore, it was like this.

237
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,579
We were sent here with a company,
they got lost

238
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,539
so I took charge of what was left.

239
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,540
Shoot now!

240
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:02,219
All men, back to your posh!

241
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,699
Two more gone.

242
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,059
- You'll have to take their plans.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,859
Their ammunition is nearly done.

244
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,819
Go, climb the walls and open the gates
and give us the signal.

245
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,379
Go!

246
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,380
- Allah akaber!
- Allah be with thee!

247
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,379
Don't keep following me!

248
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,299
You go that way and I'll go this way!

249
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Get over there.

250
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,499
Oh!

251
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,699
The signal! Allah be praised,
the gates are open!

252
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,819
Onward! Onward!

253
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,019
The gates! The gates!

254
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:13,020
They're coming to get us!

255
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,500
To the walls, men! Use the hand grenades,
it's our only chance

256
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,219
Take those grenades and hold the gate.

257
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,179
To your plans, men!

258
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,459
Ah! Throw it! Throw it! Throw it quick!

259
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,579
No! Throw it out! Over the gates!

260
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,579
Throw ill

261
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,339
Oh!

262
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,699
Oh! Oh! Where is it?

263
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,619
Oh! Oh! Oh!

264
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,659
Oh-ho!

265
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,660
Oh! Oh! Oh!

266
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,980
Just hang on there!

267
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,899
Give up! Oh! Ah!

268
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,019
Charge!

269
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,819
We've captured the chief of the riff ram

270
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,859
Yes, sir, he was trying to make
a getaway on his dormitory.

271
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,459
Not dormitory - dromedary!

272
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,979
Oh, yeah, 1; thing that eats dates.

273
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,699
Search him and take him away.

274
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,459
Ooh!

275
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,299
No, sahib, not that that. Anything but...

276
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,699
Shh!

277
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,259
Wait a minute!

278
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,379
Ooh!

279
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,380
- Take him away!
- Yes, but I think you'll definitely...
