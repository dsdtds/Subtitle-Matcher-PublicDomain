1
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,128
Pyne.

2
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,241
What is it, sir?

3
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:50,516
Oh.

4
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,650
Why, it's Mr Robin, sir.

5
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,012
Pyne.

6
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:58,490
Young Sperling was here with him
this morning. See if he's still around.

7
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:00,808
While I will call the district attorney.

8
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,151
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,671
Good morning, professor.
How are you this beautiful morning?

10
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:19,393
A terrible thing has happened.

11
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:21,258
A young man, a friend of my niece's.

12
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,363
Has been murdered at my house.

13
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:25,183
Try to calm yourself, professor.

14
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:27,363
I'll get Philo Vance on this at once.

15
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,792
In the meantime, give me all the
details you can over the phone.

16
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,489
In the first place.

17
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,200
Mr Markham, sir.

18
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,374
It seems urgent.
Will you speak to him?

19
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,399
Certainly.

20
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:47,562
I say, old fellow. Don't you ever sleep?

21
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:49,524
There's been a murder committed, Philo.

22
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,641
At the home of Professor Dillard.

23
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,004
Professor Dillard?

24
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:56,207
That interests me, Markham. Read on.

25
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:57,996
A man named Robin.

26
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,218
Was killed with a bow and arrow.

27
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,034
Robin?

28
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:04,032
Killed with an arrow?

29
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:08,133
My dear fellow, confess. You've been
on a wild chase with mother goose.

30
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:09,847
No. That's the story.

31
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,863
A fairytale in terms of blood, eh?

32
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,230
Alright, Markham.

33
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,932
I'll meet you there in half an hour.

34
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,808
Dark suit. Dark hat.

35
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,350
Dark tie.

36
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:26,142
And bring me some more hot coffee.

37
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:28,317
Very good, sir.
- Yarma.

38
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,969
Look on my reference
shelf and bring me ..

39
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,738
Dr. Elmer's book on archery.

40
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,503
The home book of verse.

41
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,613
And the German dictionary.

42
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:40,800
Very good, sir.

43
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:01,166
What do you know of this, officer?

44
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,774
The body is in the yard, sir.
Sergeant Heath is in charge.

45
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:05,932
Says he has the case
practically solved, sir.

46
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,119
Come on, Vance.

47
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,476
He converted this garden
into an archery range.

48
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,176
Miss Dillard is quite distressed.

49
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,422
Morning, Heath.
- Morning, sir.

50
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,472
Hello Mr Vance. Good to see you, sir.

51
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:30,480
Sorry they troubled you, Mr Markham.
It's an open and shut case.

52
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,111
I have it practically solved right now.

53
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:34,748
First degree murder.

54
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,018
How nice for you, Sergeant.

55
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:40,093
As long as I'm here you don't mind
if I take a little look around?

56
00:04:40,672 --> 00:04:42,992
No. Go as far as you like.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

57
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,534
See here, Mr Markham.

58
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:53,528
Sergeant.
- Yes, Mr Vance?

59
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:55,788
How about the bow that fired this arrow?

60
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:58,286
Well, that was our one best bet.

61
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:01,259
But one of the servants
picked it up in the alley here.

62
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:04,388
Carried it into the archery room
and gummed up the fingerprints.

63
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:06,353
What have you done about Sperling?

64
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,797
We've got his address.

65
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,625
He lives up Westchester way.

66
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,305
Two of my men are bringing him here now.
- Very good.

67
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:13,655
Officer.

68
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:18,316
Mind demonstrating a point for us?
- Not at all, sir.

69
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,536
When I touch you with my stick.

70
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,337
I want you to fall over backwards.

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,569
As if you'd been hit in
the heart with an arrow.

72
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:26,922
Yes, sir.
- Stand where you are.

73
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:28,545
Thank you. Ready?

74
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:34,913
Sergeant.

75
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,449
You will notice that the
first instinct of a man.

76
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,212
Shot in a vital organ.

77
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,834
Is to draw in his arms
towards the wound.

78
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:48,289
His legs.

79
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:49,962
Are doubled up.

80
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,319
You will also notice.

81
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,389
That his hat has fallen at his head.

82
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:57,410
Now, Sergeant.

83
00:05:58,613 --> 00:05:59,859
In Robin's case.

84
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,440
The arms and legs are straightened out.

85
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,221
And his hat.

86
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,864
Not only lies at his feet.

87
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,583
But is a good foot and
a half away from him.

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,139
Alright, officer. That will be all.
Thank you.

89
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:18,234
We're wasting our time, Mr Markham.

90
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:20,423
What is the good of all these theories?

91
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,847
Sperling is the boy we want.

92
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,857
And when my men bring him
in the case will be closed.

93
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,661
Sperling was probably in
love with the Dillard girl.

94
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:32,599
Had a chat with Robin.

95
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,405
Grabbed a bow and arrow.
Followed Robin outside.

96
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,551
Shoots him through
the heart and beats it.

97
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:38,544
Sergeant.

98
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,458
You are much too trusting
for this deceitful world.

99
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,726
If everything happened
as neatly as that.

100
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,524
Life would be very simple.

101
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,407
And .. very dull.

102
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,815
Yes. But Philo.
- Wait a minute, Markham.

103
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:52,798
Don't ignore the fact ..

104
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:56,101
That Robin was facing
the arrow and therefore ..

105
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,476
Would have had time to cover himself.

106
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:00,997
By Jove.

107
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,457
I've overlooked something.

108
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,785
If a man is stabbed in the heart there's
sure to be an immediate flow of blood.

109
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:08,053
Especially.

110
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,926
When the tip of the weapon
is larger than the shaft.

111
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,094
Yes. That is so.
- It is ..

112
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,569
Quite possible, Sergeant, you
will find some blood spots.

113
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,285
On the floor of the ..

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,080
The archery room.

115
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,622
Look and see, will you?

116
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:26,490
See here, Vance.

117
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,287
What is in your mind?

118
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,535
Numberless things.

119
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:36,625
They boil down to the notion that Robin
wasn't killed by a bow and arrow at all.

120
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,544
Hang it all, Mr Vance.
You had the dope alright.

121
00:07:40,089 --> 00:07:42,014
There is a dark stain
on the cement floor.

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,606
The coroner here says it is human blood.

123
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:46,213
Morning, doctor.
- Morning.

124
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,739
You fellows must have an
arrangement with these people.

125
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,745
Every time I have a day off they
go and get themselves murdered.

126
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:55,401
And a nice fancy murder you've
picked out for me this time.

127
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,779
If I were you, doctor, I should ..

128
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,914
I should examine the base
of the skull for a bad fracture.

129
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,654
Your suspicions were right, Vance.

130
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:13,535
The skull is fractured, and badly too.

131
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:15,920
It looks like he had a crushing blow.

132
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:19,038
The professor and his niece are ready
for you in the archery room, sir.

133
00:08:19,273 --> 00:08:21,356
Alright, Sergeant. You're in charge.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,199
Sergeant.
- Sir?

135
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:27,203
Just because this case looks so simple.

136
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:30,712
I trust you have not neglected to take
your usual excellent photographs?

137
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,139
Certainly not, sir.

138
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:34,783
They are being developed right now.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

139
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:38,902
Come on. What's the matter with you?
Get busy and take these pictures.

140
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,938
What's the idea? You just spending
the day here or something?

141
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,277
Good morning, professor.
- Good morning.

142
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,624
I regret that a tragedy should
be the reason for this meeting.

143
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:05,477
You remember my niece, don't you?
- Yes indeed.

144
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,027
I want you both to meet Mr Philo Vance.

145
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:09,658
How do you do, sir?

146
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,008
If you tell him just what
you know of the tragedy.

147
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:13,815
He'll be of great help to us.

148
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:15,939
Won't you sit down, gentlemen?
- Thank you.

149
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:17,619
You sit down there, my dear.

150
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,404
I told Markham practically everything
that I knew over the telephone.

151
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:33,677
Robin and Sperling called to see Belle.
But she was out playing tennis.

152
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,505
I heard them talking up in the
drawing room for a few minutes.

153
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,128
Then they came on down here.

154
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:44,152
I worked in my study for about an hour.

155
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,943
And I thought I heard a noise.

156
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,210
It sounded like a scream.

157
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:51,480
But I couldn't be sure because ..

158
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,906
The maid was using the
vacuum in the hall.

159
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:55,440
Then.

160
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:58,410
I stepped out onto the balcony.

161
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:01,238
And saw the body of ..

162
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:02,947
Poor Robin.

163
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,096
The rest you know.

164
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,022
About that ..

165
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:12,014
Scream, professor.

166
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:16,093
Could you be at all sure from
what direction it came?

167
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:17,652
No.

168
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,836
I could not be sure that it
was a scream that I heard.

169
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:24,179
It might have been an automobile siren.

170
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:27,092
We hear so many traffic
noises from the drive.

171
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,584
Where were the other members of your
household at the time of the murder?

172
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,618
The cook had gone to market.

173
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:35,289
Belle was out playing tennis.

174
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,687
Mr Arnesson.

175
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,138
My adopted son, had left
for the university.

176
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,246
We phoned to him but he wasn't there.

177
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:48,845
So we left him a message. I do hope
they've been able to find him by now.

178
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,075
I see.

179
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:54,560
I say.

180
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,030
There is an arrow missing here.

181
00:10:58,514 --> 00:10:59,531
That is strange.

182
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,771
It has been taken in great haste too.

183
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,683
This holder.

184
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:06,804
Has been badly ..

185
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:08,071
Bent.

186
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:09,896
Poor cock robin.

187
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:15,159
Cock robin?

188
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:18,288
We all called him that.

189
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,062
We did it to tease him.

190
00:11:22,004 --> 00:11:22,924
Miss Dillard.

191
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:26,284
Did you happen to know by any chance
that Sperling in German means ..

192
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,605
Sparrow?

193
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:29,998
Yes.

194
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,209
Yes I know.

195
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,719
You speak German?

196
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:33,775
No.

197
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,347
Then how did you know that
Sperling means sparrow?

198
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:37,894
Well.

199
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:39,624
The other day.

200
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,163
Robin stepped out
onto the archery range.

201
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,809
Just as Mr Sperling aimed at the target.

202
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,218
Mr Arnesson was watching
and called to Robin.

203
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:49,819
'Be careful'.

204
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:53,357
You are a cock robin in
that archer is a sparrow.

205
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,494
Mr Arnesson seems very well
acquainted with his nursery rhymes.

206
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,841
Just a minute.
Where do you think you're going?

207
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,355
I am Eric Arnesson. I live here.
I was telephoned for.

208
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:12,649
Of course, if you don't want me
to come in that's alright with me.

209
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,708
Sorry. I didn't know who you were.
- Why is the house littered with police?

210
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,556
Who at best are hardly ornamental.

211
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,842
There has been a murder, sir.
A young man.

212
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:22,902
They are expecting you so
you'll get the details inside.

213
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,978
A murder?
- Come on, Johnny.

214
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:31,018
Mama, I want to go home
because I'm hungry.

215
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:32,638
Hush dear. Mother is busy.

216
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,970
There is Mr Arnesson now.
- Eric.

217
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:35,969
Eric.

218
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:37,886
I am so glad you're here.

219
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,883
Robin has been killed.
- Robin?

220
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:42,416
Cock robin.

221
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:46,682
His name was against him, wasn't it?
- Please don't.

222
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,691
Don't be cynical now.

223
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,972
For my sake.
- I am sorry, darling.

224
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:52,337
And Johnny's.

225
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,860
I know how hard this is for you, Johnny.

226
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:58,512
What great pals you and Robin were.

227
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:01,872
I can't believe it.

228
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,699
Hello Markham.
- Morning.

229
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:05,912
Morning, doctor.

230
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,357
Mr Vance - Mr Arnesson.

231
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:08,520
How do you do?

232
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,913
This is John Sprigg, one of my students.
- Yes.

233
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:13,777
Robin was the best friend
I had in the world.

234
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,992
And I'm going to find
the man who murdered him.

235
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,001
Taking death tragically is
one of the weaknesses of youth.

236
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:28,255
So we have a real murder
mystery, have we?

237
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:30,921
Might I be entrusted with the details?

238
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,561
Where were Robin and
Sperling when you left?

239
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,768
Downstairs in the archery room.

240
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:37,922
Is that so?

241
00:13:40,161 --> 00:13:42,306
Did you overhear anything they said?

242
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,696
I don't listen at keyholes.

243
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,224
Well, little bright-eyes.

244
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,834
They ought to erect a statue to you
for being the first woman who don't.

245
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,789
Was there anybody else
in the archery room?

246
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,609
When you left this morning.

247
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:00,884
I thought I heard Mr Drukker.

248
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:05,286
But he sneaks in and out at
all hours of the day and night.

249
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:10,338
Now we are getting somewhere.

250
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:15,662
You can tell me all about this case and
let me work it out on scientific lines.

251
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,017
Is that a bargain?

252
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,910
Of course, we can't very well
promise to tell everything we know.

253
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,283
It might be indiscreet.
- Wait a minute.

254
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:25,240
Wait a minute, Markham.
I really don't see any reason ..

255
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,706
Why Mr Arnesson should not apply his ..

256
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,410
Scientific knowledge to this crime.

257
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:33,651
I'm quite sure he can be depended upon.

258
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,209
Oh, I am very dependable.

259
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,332
Well, that is true.
- Mr Arnesson.

260
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,933
The first thing you can do to help
us is to tell us about the Drukkers.

261
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,475
We'll interview them next.

262
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,651
Well, Miss Drukker is a little ..

263
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,274
Peculiar. Though perfectly harmless.

264
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,881
She thinks the sun rises
and sets in her brother.

265
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:57,659
If I were you I'd take Miss Dillard
along when you go along to question her.

266
00:14:58,434 --> 00:14:59,677
Miss Drukker likes her.

267
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:02,304
Yes. That's a very good
suggestion, Arnesson.

268
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:06,519
Belle darling. These gentlemen are
going to interview the Drukkers now.

269
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,550
I said you would go along with them.

270
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:12,233
It makes it easier for Miss Drukker.
- Yes, dear.

271
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:16,265
Now, if you can spare me for a while.

272
00:15:16,793 --> 00:15:18,682
I have some lecture
notes I ought to edit.

273
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:20,500
Certainly, Mr Arnesson.

274
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:25,801
Miss Dillard.

275
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,369
Yes?

276
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:31,713
How good an archer is Mr Drukker?

277
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:35,359
Why, he knows nothing about archery.

278
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:36,704
Oh?

279
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:44,117
Mr Drukker is hardly the type
to be interested in archery.

280
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,051
When you see him, Vance,
you'll understand.

281
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:48,467
Tell me, Miss Dillard.

282
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,211
Is Miss Drukker an invalid?

283
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:51,616
No. Not exactly.

284
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,400
You see, one day when
they were children.

285
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:57,659
She let her brother fall.

286
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,783
He injured his spine
and became a cripple.

287
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,937
From that day on her
entire life was ruined.

288
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:05,980
She.

289
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:07,164
Well.

290
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:09,199
It affected her so deeply that ..

291
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,381
She's been unable to
leave her room since.

292
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,278
Where is Miss Drukker's room located?

293
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:16,294
Her room is the one with the bay window.

294
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,479
She sits there a great deal and
watches us at archery practice.

295
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,577
You know, uncle says her
condition is a sort-of ..

296
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,227
Insanity of tenderness.

297
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,743
Does Mr Drukker reciprocate
his sister's tenderness?

298
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,069
Well.

299
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,722
Please don't judge
Mr Drukker too harshly.

300
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:35,246
He's had so much to bear.
We know him well and are fond of him.

301
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:36,403
Yes.

302
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,862
Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning, Miss Dillard.

303
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:53,733
Mr Vance?
- Yes.

304
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:55,958
I'm Dr. Van Pelt.
- Good morning, doctor.

305
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,662
This is district attorney Markham.

306
00:16:57,864 --> 00:16:59,463
How do you do?
- Morning, doctor.

307
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,806
I have attached a remote stethoscope
to my patient to safeguard her.

308
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,543
And at the same time not
interfere with your questioning.

309
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:09,481
Any undue strain on her
heart will prove fatal.

310
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:12,671
So, if she excites herself
I will have to stop you.

311
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,087
We'll be as brief as possible, doctor.
- Thank you.

312
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:18,820
Sorry to intrude, Miss Drukker.

313
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:21,761
But I'd like to get a view of the
archery range from your window.

314
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:27,405
I wanted to come right over here.
I knew how upset you've been.

315
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:29,713
Child.

316
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,196
Miss Drukker.

317
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:40,086
As your window has such a
clear view of the archery range ..

318
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,733
We hoped you may be able to help us.
- No. No.

319
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:44,505
I saw no-one.

320
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:47,004
I haven't looked out
of my window all day.

321
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:49,561
Most unfortunate.

322
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:53,523
Had you looked out of the window earlier
you may have seen who killed Mr Robin.

323
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:56,112
With a bow and arrow.

324
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:59,526
An arrow through the robin's breast.

325
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:05,575
That seems perfectly natural.

326
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:06,992
Doesn't it?

327
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:09,759
Is your brother at home, Miss Drukker?

328
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:10,858
My brother?

329
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:14,131
What do you want with him?
- Don't distress yourself. Please.

330
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:16,030
We only thought ..

331
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,587
Perhaps your brother might have seen
a man on the archery range this morning.

332
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:20,888
He saw no-one.

333
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:24,736
He couldn't have seen anyone
because he wasn't here.

334
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,044
He went out early this morning.

335
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,815
And he hasn't returned.

336
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:29,960
But, dear.

337
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:32,728
Adolph was at our house this morning.
He came to see Eric.

338
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,527
No.

339
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:34,641
No.

340
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,043
Adolph went away somewhere.

341
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,511
Downtown.

342
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,949
He wasn't anywhere near your house.

343
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,318
I know he wasn't.

344
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,019
I should have known if ..

345
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,349
Mr Drukker.
We were just speaking about you.

346
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:15,439
Merely as a matter of form,
would you mind telling us ..

347
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,831
Where you were between
10 and 11 this morning?

348
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,274
The hour of this morning's tragedy.

349
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:30,636
Between 10 and 11?

350
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:32,241
Yes, Mr Drukker.

351
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:39,509
What did you see?

352
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,516
What do you mean?

353
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,339
I mean.

354
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:47,792
It was about that time.

355
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,610
When I heard a scream in this room.

356
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,005
You didn't.

357
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:54,115
No.

358
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:56,994
No. I didn't scream.

359
00:19:58,076 --> 00:19:59,640
I didn't scream.

360
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,349
I am sorry, gentlemen.

361
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,375
But I'll have to ask you to
conclude this interview now.

362
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:05,723
Alright, doctor.

363
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:07,998
If you don't mind,
I will stay with Miss Drukker.

364
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,120
Miss Dillard.

365
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,893
Goodbye, Miss Drukker. Thank you.

366
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:15,684
I wonder.

367
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,469
I wonder if you would mind
coming with us, Mr Drukker?

368
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:28,877
Don't go with them, Adolph.

369
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:30,636
Don't go.

370
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,198
They are the enemy.

371
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,686
They mean to hurt you.

372
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:58,912
Mr Drukker.

373
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,920
Just what did you do when you
visited the Dillard home this morning?

374
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,215
I went down in the archery room.

375
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,396
And glanced over the magazines.

376
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,701
There was a chess
problem in one of them.

377
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,814
I sat down and worked it out.

378
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:19,984
Are you ..

379
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,930
Are you interested in chess, Mr Drukker?

380
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:25,878
Tremendously.

381
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:27,660
But this.

382
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:32,201
This particular problem
was easy to solve.

383
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,157
It took me less than half an hour.

384
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:38,069
Oh?

385
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,122
Then you must have been
in the archery room when ..

386
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,299
Mr Robin and Mr Sperling
came there this morning.

387
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:56,019
Were you under the
impression, Mr Drukker ..

388
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,000
That they had been quarrelling?

389
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,691
Now that you mention it.

390
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:06,366
There did seem to be a
coolness between them.

391
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,233
But I left the room.

392
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:12,825
Almost immediately after they entered.

393
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:16,220
Anyhow, you're quite sure
that you heard your ..

394
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:17,843
Your sister scream?

395
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:20,123
At the hour of the murder this morning.

396
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:22,345
What are you driving at?

397
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:26,219
I tell you I heard her scream.

398
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:29,502
I don't care whether
she admits it or not.

399
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,107
I was in my room.

400
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:34,087
At the time of the murder.

401
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,629
You can't prove anything different.

402
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,022
What has her scream ..

403
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:43,056
Got to do with the murder anyway?

404
00:22:44,424 --> 00:22:45,764
Didn't she tell you she ..

405
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:47,707
She saw nothing?

406
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:52,943
Alright, Mr Drukker.

407
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,488
That will be all for
the present, thank you.

408
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:03,549
Back already?

409
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,374
This Mr John Pardee,
the famous chess player.

410
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:07,487
How do you do?

411
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:09,907
These gentlemen are
Mr Markham the district attorney.

412
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:11,252
And Mr Philo Vance.

413
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,960
I trust I'm not intruding.

414
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:16,370
But I perceived that something
unusual had happened here.

415
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,591
It occurred to me that I
might be of some service.

416
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,826
Occurred?

417
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,917
My dear Pardee, I've no doubt you were
hanging out of the window all morning.

418
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,539
Panting with curiosity.

419
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:29,173
May I be permitted to
see Professor Dillard?

420
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,966
Professor Dillard has a very hard ..
- Certainly, Mr Pardee.

421
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,159
I think you will find him upstairs.
- Thank you. Thank you.

422
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:41,128
Mr Pardee.
- Yes?

423
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,970
How good a chess player ..

424
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:48,542
Is Mr Drukker?

425
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:51,417
Why, he isn't really a player at all.

426
00:23:52,171 --> 00:23:53,414
Though he thinks he is.

427
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,811
Of course, he has some understanding ..

428
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:57,479
Of the theory of the game.

429
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,656
Oh yes?

430
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,607
If I can be of any assistance.

431
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:12,781
I shall be very glad
to see the murderer ..

432
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,129
Brought to justice.

433
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:24,489
Yes.

434
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:29,734
Excuse me.

435
00:24:38,105 --> 00:24:39,516
Here's a funny one, sir.

436
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:43,115
The officer outside thought
he'd take a peep in the mailbox.

437
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:44,527
And found this.

438
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:49,398
Read that.

439
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:02,090
Is there by any chance a
typewriter in this house?

440
00:25:02,444 --> 00:25:04,430
No. There never has been
one to my knowledge.

441
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:06,505
Thank you.

442
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:09,908
'The Bishop'.

443
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:13,182
Dear me. I hope the church
isn't involved in this mystery.

444
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:15,447
That would be embarrassing.

445
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:18,127
Some crank wrote that note, Mr Vance.

446
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:20,468
Don't forget, Sergeant.

447
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,917
That crank of yours would have
to know a good many details.

448
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:27,915
He would have to know that Robin's
middle name was 'Cochrane'.

449
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:31,142
That he was presumably
killed by a bow and arrow.

450
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:35,313
And that Sperling was with him
around the time of the murder.

451
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,769
Well, that is what I said.

452
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:44,995
We got him, Sergeant.
He beat it straight home from here.

453
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:47,788
And was packing up when
we walked in on him.

454
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,988
He said he was going on a weekend trip.

455
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:55,462
Well, young fellow.
Thought you'd get away, did you?

456
00:25:57,555 --> 00:26:00,852
Oh. You're one of those
silent lads, are you?

457
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:04,512
Say, we'll have you talking so much ..

458
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,263
That lockjaw will look like
a case of St. Vitus dance.

459
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,796
Shall I send him to headquarters, sir?

460
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:12,641
Perhaps Mr Sperling won't object
to answering a few questions.

461
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:14,480
Mr Sperling.

462
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,897
What time did you leave
here this morning?

463
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:19,371
A quarter of ten.
- And Mr Robin?

464
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,517
I don't know what time Robin went.

465
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:24,223
Say, look here.
What's this all about anyway?

466
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,590
Mr Robin.

467
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,349
Was murdered here this
morning around ten o'clock.

468
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:32,885
Robin murdered?

469
00:26:35,183 --> 00:26:36,402
Who killed him?

470
00:26:37,016 --> 00:26:38,195
We don't know.

471
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,436
Yet.

472
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:42,041
He was shot through the
heart with an arrow.

473
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:44,856
Mr Sperling.

474
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,881
Will you let me see your right hand?

475
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:51,706
Easy now. Easy.

476
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,678
Alright. I took that hunting arrow down.

477
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:04,003
Robin and I had an argument about it.

478
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,249
And I cut my finger doing it too.

479
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:09,835
But that doesn't say that I killed him.

480
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:12,009
No. No, of course not.

481
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,393
Say, Mr Sperling.

482
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:18,175
If you left here at quarter to ten.

483
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,548
What did you do between then and when
you took the train to Westchester?

484
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,156
I .. I was sitting in the park.

485
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:30,853
Twittering to the little
birdies, I suppose?

486
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:32,793
What were you doing there?

487
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,576
Feeding nuts to the squirrels.

488
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:36,947
Nuts?

489
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:41,452
Mr Markham, you going to let this
bird make monkeys of us?

490
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:43,822
Let me send him to headquarters.
- Send him in.

491
00:27:44,555 --> 00:27:46,809
And Adams. Check his alibi.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:52,927
You know, Mr Vance.

493
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,870
I got nothing against theories.

494
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,655
Except that you can't hang them.

495
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:00,737
Mr Arnesson.

496
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,610
Do either Mr Pardee or
Mr Drukker own a typewriter?

497
00:28:04,812 --> 00:28:06,994
Yes. They both do.
- Would it be a trouble to you ..

498
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:09,570
To secure me samples of type
from both those typewriters?

499
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,752
No trouble at all.
- See here, Mr Vance.

500
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,893
What's the good of all this hooey when
I got the murderer right outside?

501
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:18,906
Nevertheless, Mr Arnesson,
I should like those samples of type.

502
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:20,880
If you don't mind, Sergeant.

503
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,952
Eric.
- Yes, dear?

504
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,341
How can you sit there calmly and discuss
books and theories and formulas ..

505
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,504
When right outside this house
that poor boy was murdered?

506
00:28:34,054 --> 00:28:35,658
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

507
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:38,447
My dear, don't you see that
what I'm doing it for your sake?

508
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:40,490
You must put Robin out of your head.

509
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:43,139
As cruel and as unnecessary
as his death has been.

510
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:44,769
Life is cruel.

511
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:47,847
But what can we crawling
microbes do about it?

512
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:50,446
Not that you aren't a
very charming microbe.

513
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,008
I know.

514
00:28:52,871 --> 00:28:54,606
I'm just horribly nervous. That's all.

515
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,600
If only I could do something
to distract my mind.

516
00:28:57,886 --> 00:28:59,549
I wish I could take you out tonight.

517
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:02,749
Unfortunately, I promised to see Markham
and Vance at the Stuyvesant Club.

518
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,688
Why must they drag you into this?

519
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,255
Why can't you keep out of it, Eric?
Please.

520
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:08,860
It frightens me.

521
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:10,176
My dear child.

522
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:11,973
Eric is quite right.

523
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:15,387
After all.

524
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:16,872
What have we to fear?

525
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,765
What is it?

526
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,911
Drukker, what the deuce
are you doing out there?

527
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:30,330
I'm looking for the blunt instrument.

528
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,848
That was used to bash in Robin's head.

529
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,077
If I can only find that.

530
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:39,531
I've got a theory.

531
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:42,562
That will surprise all the experts.

532
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:47,338
The scientific mind, Arnesson.

533
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,432
That is what counts.

534
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,290
Aha. Competition.

535
00:29:56,302 --> 00:29:58,266
Another scientific mind on the trail.

536
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,847
I'm too nervous to sit here any longer.
May I be excused please?

537
00:30:03,121 --> 00:30:04,235
Certainly, my dear.

538
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:05,968
Goodnight, darling.

539
00:30:09,623 --> 00:30:10,737
You've startled me.

540
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:13,968
You always slip into a room so
quietly no-one ever hears you.

541
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,215
My dear, you mustn't be
rude to Mr Pardee.

542
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:17,373
I am sorry.

543
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:18,849
Pardon me.

544
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,638
I am a little earlier than usual.

545
00:30:22,882 --> 00:30:24,351
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, dear.

546
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:26,094
Oh, Arnesson.

547
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,341
I had that quotation
typed you asked me for.

548
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:31,357
I hope it's the right one.

549
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:34,948
Thank you. That is quite right.

550
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:37,157
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, my boy.

551
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:40,853
Won't you sit down, Pardee?
- Thank you.

552
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:45,480
Have some coffee.
- Thank you.

553
00:30:46,216 --> 00:30:47,289
Help yourself.

554
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:51,635
I wonder why Arnesson
asked me for that quotation.

555
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,956
He hardly looked at it.

556
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:56,299
I really don't know.

557
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:00,575
No, Markham. I can't quite agree.
- Well.

558
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,074
Evening, Eric.
- Hello Arnesson.

559
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:06,112
Your great brains are hard at work, eh?

560
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,676
I felt the vibrations
as I entered the room.

561
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:10,706
Won't you sit down?
- Thanks. I will.

562
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:12,410
Have a cigarette.
- Thank you.

563
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:16,836
The juvenile Sherlock Holmes,
not to be outdone.

564
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:19,548
Has been collecting
typewriter specimens.

565
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:21,938
Good. Thank you.

566
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:25,574
Now let's see.

567
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,216
The style of the uppercase
'G' used in The Bishop note.

568
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:39,625
Was changed before ..

569
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:42,492
Either of these typewriters
was put on the market.

570
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,062
And the 'E'.

571
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:48,051
The most frequently used
letter of the alphabet.

572
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:49,626
Is out of vertical alignment.

573
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,514
Evening, gentlemen.

574
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:56,061
Pardon me, gentlemen.
- Will you have some coffee?

575
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:57,183
No thank you.

576
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,270
Or some .. nuts?

577
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:00,890
No.

578
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:07,530
This was received by
The World in the last mail.

579
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,007
The Herald and The Times
have a copy too.

580
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:14,016
See the station number?

581
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,141
This was mailed from the
neighborhood of the murder.

582
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,832
It was also mailed.

583
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:23,175
After you put Sperling under arrest.

584
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,478
The Bishop was afraid the
public wouldn't get his joke.

585
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:28,775
So he explained it to the press.

586
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:30,365
Now the thing to do.

587
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,120
Analyse the person
with the type of mind ..

588
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,139
Who would find himself a bishop.

589
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,335
I saw several chess bulletins.

590
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,716
In the Dillard archery
room this morning.

591
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,287
A bishop.

592
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:49,344
Is a very important
piece in a chess game.

593
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:53,354
I wonder if that's what it means.

594
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:55,304
No. You're wrong, Vance.

595
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:57,204
The Bishop's signature.

596
00:32:57,406 --> 00:33:00,620
Is undoubtedly the working of a
mind deranged by religious mania.

597
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:03,634
Isn't that your reaction, Arnesson?
- Yes.

598
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,384
And no.

599
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,380
I can imagine the sane mind would
use a chessman or a churchman.

600
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,920
Gentlemen, I think we're
all wasting our time.

601
00:33:14,813 --> 00:33:17,930
There are enough suspicious elements in
this case to warrant our making arrests.

602
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:20,857
And I propose to act and not
sit here all night on theories.

603
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,885
My dear Markham, the people have
invested you with the power of action.

604
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:28,011
But if you insist on plunging in wildly
and making reckless decisions, well ..

605
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:31,583
You will have to make them alone.
For I shall withdraw from the case.

606
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,846
You know, gentlemen.

607
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,388
This is no ordinary crime.

608
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:40,382
And we cannot proceed
in an ordinary manner.

609
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:43,642
Mark my words.

610
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:47,607
This is not a single murder
that we're trying to solve.

611
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:50,925
It is the beginning.

612
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:53,673
Of a series of murders.

613
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,411
Ghastly and inhuman.

614
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:03,045
A bishop.

615
00:35:30,355 --> 00:35:32,078
Hello darlings.
- Hello Miss Belle.

616
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:36,264
Would you read a story to
me out my big book today?

617
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,977
Sweetheart.
Miss Belle hasn't much time, darling.

618
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:42,340
Just one?

619
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,544
Well, maybe just one little one, huh?
- Yes.

620
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:58,148
Who said I was going to read to you?

621
00:35:58,632 --> 00:35:59,601
Who said so?

622
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:07,215
Everybody is here today.

623
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:09,880
Tell me now.

624
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:12,359
What would you like to hear?
- I would like to hear ..

625
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,170
Jack and Jill.

626
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:16,414
I like to hear little Cock-Robin.

627
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,809
I'd like to hear Cinderella.

628
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:20,512
Here's one. Here we go.

629
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:22,654
Alright. Now listen.

630
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:26,297
Listen, everyone must keep quiet.

631
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,371
'Jack and Jill went up the
hill to fetch a pail of water'.

632
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:35,394
'Jack fell down and broke his crown
and Jill came tumbling after'.

633
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:45,861
'Old King Cole was a merry old soul'.

634
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:48,685
'And a merry old soul was he'.

635
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:51,226
Are you looking for somebody?

636
00:36:51,596 --> 00:36:52,258
Uhuh.

637
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:53,891
He'll be here in a minute.

638
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:58,317
'He called for his pipe and
he called for his bowl'.

639
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:33,693
'Little Miss Muffet say on a
tuffet eating her curds and whey'.

640
00:37:33,993 --> 00:37:36,825
Then along came a spider
that sat down beside her.

641
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:39,587
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

642
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,181
Eric. You frightened me.

643
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:44,349
Sorry, darling. I'm just a clumsy brute.

644
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:03,320
Morning Arnesson.
- Why, Holmes.

645
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,854
And Dr. Watson.

646
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:08,128
What's this I hear about
Johnny Sprigg being shot?

647
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:12,258
There's nothing much to tell except that
Johnny Sprigg was shot this morning.

648
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:14,415
With a little gun.

649
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,098
Through the top of his head.

650
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,973
More storybook nonsense.

651
00:38:18,803 --> 00:38:21,616
What a pity his parents called
him 'Johnny'. It sealed his doom.

652
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,404
A brilliant student. Almost a genius.

653
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,655
An extraordinary thing
happened last night, Arnesson.

654
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:32,045
The murderer visited the Drukker
household around midnight and left a ..

655
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:36,104
A black bishop from a chess
game at Miss Drukker's door.

656
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:37,444
A chess bishop?

657
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:39,188
That clears the church anyway.

658
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:41,587
Just as a customary routine.
- Yes?

659
00:38:42,046 --> 00:38:44,258
Would you mind telling us
where you went last night?

660
00:38:44,664 --> 00:38:46,521
After you left us at
the Stuyvesant Club?

661
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:47,753
That is easy.

662
00:38:48,297 --> 00:38:51,405
I dropped in at the theater to see an
Ibsen play. An old favorite of mine.

663
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:54,341
When I got back, the
professor was still up writing.

664
00:38:54,543 --> 00:38:56,186
Pardee and Drukker had visited him.

665
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:59,366
Pardee had shown him one of his
chess problems and he and Drukker ..

666
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:01,861
Had quarrelled about every
position on the board.

667
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:03,990
Pardee had gone on to his chess club.

668
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,818
At what time did you arrive
home from your theater?

669
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:09,533
A little after midnight.

670
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:12,640
Too late to have distributed
chessmen to the neighbors.

671
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,336
I am sorry to disappoint you.

672
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:18,360
You're not necessarily under
suspicion, Arnesson. But ..

673
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:20,921
You can help us by
answering some questions.

674
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:21,936
Glad to.

675
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,657
Are there any revolvers in this house?

676
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:27,510
No. No revolvers.

677
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,414
No sliding panels and
no secret stairways.

678
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:33,481
You say that Mr Pardee went
straight from here to his chess club?

679
00:39:33,763 --> 00:39:34,392
Yes.

680
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:38,920
I assure you Mr Pardee is the last man
in the world to suspect as a murderer.

681
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:40,034
Oh yes.

682
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:41,710
Yes, I am sure of it.

683
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,701
But we mustn't hurt his
feelings by neglecting him.

684
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:48,252
So I think we'll pay
Mr Pardee a little visit.

685
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:49,261
Yes.

686
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:52,674
I should think a chess expert would be a
great help to you in solving the crime.

687
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:53,864
Mr Vance.

688
00:39:54,276 --> 00:39:55,901
I am so glad you are here.

689
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:57,233
Some.

690
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:01,177
Some dreadful things seem be happening
to everyone who comes to this house.

691
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:05,108
I am afraid. I'm afraid for all of us.

692
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:07,927
Something keeps saying to me.

693
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,035
'Which of you will be next'?
- My dear Miss Dillard.

694
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:13,273
Our problem is to match
normal thinking ..

695
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:16,033
Against the abnormal
scheming of a criminal mind.

696
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:19,935
Please believe me when I say we're doing
everything in our power to help you.

697
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:21,592
Come along, Markham.

698
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:23,271
Eric.

699
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,774
If only you could take
me away someplace.

700
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:28,759
I only feel safe when I am with you.

701
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,325
Did you ..?

702
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:44,518
Hey.

703
00:40:46,302 --> 00:40:48,962
Did you know this young Sprigg
that was shot this morning?

704
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:51,395
Yes. And if you ask me
they shot the wrong man.

705
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,377
What kind of ..?

706
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:57,812
Turn it off.

707
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,689
What kind of a guy was this Drukker?

708
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,269
With the crooked back.

709
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,930
If the only thing crooked about you
was your back you would be lucky.

710
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:09,814
Did you see ..?

711
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:11,191
Did you see ..?

712
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:15,175
Did you see anybody go out
the front door this morning?

713
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:18,671
It ain't what goes out of
this house that counts.

714
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:20,310
It's the tripe that comes in.

715
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:22,012
Look here.

716
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:25,118
Turn that thing off.

717
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:28,728
It's about time you had some
respect for the hand of the law.

718
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:30,370
The hand of the law?

719
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:33,368
The only thing I ever see around
here is a lot of flat feet.

720
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:34,541
Is that so?

721
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:42,806
Oh yeah?

722
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:04,101
I wish you would come down to earth.

723
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,152
And admit we have a good
circumstantial case against Drukker.

724
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:10,065
I'm not so sure that we have.
- Who else could have done it?

725
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:11,841
Sperling is out.

726
00:42:12,403 --> 00:42:14,435
His alibi sounded crazy but it was okay.

727
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:16,744
Feeding nuts to squirrels.

728
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:18,398
And so he was.

729
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:21,181
He left enough peanut shells
to have fed an elephant.

730
00:42:23,461 --> 00:42:26,192
That's a pretty little thing
you're playing, Mr Vance.

731
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,142
One of my favorites.

732
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,164
It's the Nutcracker Suite.

733
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,274
By Tchaikovsky.

734
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:34,885
Oh?

735
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,411
Tchaikovsky.

736
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:38,661
Yes.

737
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:44,181
I don't know.

738
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:46,154
You may be right, Markham.

739
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:49,649
My chief objection to your conclusion
is that the case against Drukker ..

740
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,011
Is too easy.

741
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:53,135
I wish I had more cases
that were too easy.

742
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:54,823
Remember.

743
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:57,186
Our criminal is super sane.

744
00:42:57,856 --> 00:42:59,261
His acts were not senseless.

745
00:42:59,484 --> 00:43:01,244
They are hideously perfect and precise.

746
00:43:01,564 --> 00:43:04,207
Consequently, that same mind would
never permit the case against him ..

747
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:06,490
To seem as easy as our case
seems against Drukker.

748
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:08,937
How are you going to reconcile
Mother Goose rhymes ..

749
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:10,554
With a super-sane mind?

750
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:13,363
The grim humor of an intellect.

751
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,046
That says cynically.

752
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:16,142
Behold.

753
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:18,714
This is the world you take so seriously.

754
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:22,086
Like a child's game is hardly important
enough to make a joke about it.

755
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,388
You will find that is a
sound theory, Markham.

756
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,805
Well, theory sure makes
swell talking, Mr Vance.

757
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:32,571
But when it comes to
action give me facts.

758
00:43:33,348 --> 00:43:35,348
It ain't what you imagine
that counts then.

759
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,229
It's what you see.

760
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,592
Right.

761
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:40,916
Right as usual, Sergeant.

762
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,048
But it all depends on what you see.

763
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:44,861
For instance.

764
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:48,083
I can see that tonight you took
a young lady out to dinner.

765
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,468
That you didn't have enough
money to pay the bill.

766
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,258
But when you told her you were coming
here the young lady became tearful.

767
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:57,123
And you promised to join her later.

768
00:43:57,325 --> 00:43:59,326
Come now, Vance.
- It's all quite simple, Markham.

769
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:00,275
Really.

770
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,816
I know that he took a
young lady out to dinner.

771
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,940
Because he has shaved
since this afternoon.

772
00:44:06,178 --> 00:44:08,197
You did not have enough
money to pay the bill.

773
00:44:08,586 --> 00:44:10,055
And wrote a check to cover it.

774
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:12,173
For there's an ink stain on your finger.

775
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:14,552
And you're otherwise immaculate.

776
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:18,271
I know the young lady became tearful
and that you wiped away her tears.

777
00:44:19,275 --> 00:44:21,552
For there is a smudge of
mascara on your handkerchief.

778
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:25,616
You promised to join her later as you've
looked at your watch since you arrived.

779
00:44:26,244 --> 00:44:27,584
Clearly, my dear Sergeant.

780
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:34,111
Well, at least you wouldn't mind ..

781
00:44:34,611 --> 00:44:36,953
If Sergeant Heath brought
Drukker here tomorrow morning.

782
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,971
Then we can find out what he knows.

783
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:41,068
And act accordingly.
- No. Not at all.

784
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:42,204
Not at all.

785
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:43,915
Well, I guess I'll be going.

786
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:47,338
Before you tell me
what I did last night.

787
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:51,956
Have something before you go, Sergeant.
It's right there.

788
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:55,154
No thanks.

789
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:56,809
It's too easy.

790
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:58,866
Ha, ha, ha.

791
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:03,224
Nevertheless, Markham. He's the finest
Sergeant you have in your force.

792
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:04,559
Indeed he is.

793
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:46,608
What a terrible fog over the river.

794
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:54,137
I can never remember the
fog being so thick before.

795
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,544
Confidentially, professor.

796
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:05,755
Don't you think that Pardee ..

797
00:46:06,704 --> 00:46:09,157
Has been acting rather peculiar of late?

798
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:12,804
You know as well as I do.

799
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:15,325
Pardee was always strange.

800
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:18,462
He is worse than ever.

801
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,586
I think he is responsible.

802
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:25,935
For those detectives snooping around.

803
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,034
I don't think so.

804
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,608
The fog is getting worse.

805
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,205
Good evening, professor.

806
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:10,735
A fine way for a grown-up guy
to earn a living, ain't it?

807
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,131
Playing around here in the fog.

808
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:17,272
Aren't you neglecting your
chess this evening?

809
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:20,262
You should not forget that ..

810
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:22,429
Practice makes perfect.

811
00:47:22,991 --> 00:47:26,068
It would hardly be of much use
to practice, my dear Drukker.

812
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:28,876
Without you to hang over my chair.

813
00:47:29,343 --> 00:47:32,082
And criticise my moves as
you do so brilliantly.

814
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:34,859
Well, a little criticism won't harm you.

815
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,041
Now, gentlemen. Gentlemen.

816
00:47:37,502 --> 00:47:38,633
Please.

817
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,015
I wish there was somewhere to
be comfortable around here.

818
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,899
Those old dodos will stand
there and gab all night.

819
00:47:58,136 --> 00:48:00,397
I ain't stuck on this kind
of a case you know.

820
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:02,847
If I was making them.

821
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,725
I'd like a nice, snappy love nest.

822
00:48:06,506 --> 00:48:07,943
Gentlemen, it's getting late.

823
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:09,204
Goodnight.

824
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:10,658
Goodnight.

825
00:48:11,928 --> 00:48:14,014
Well, the boys are leaving us.

826
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:17,221
I'll pick up my man and get
to the street ahead of him.

827
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:20,054
And see him safely off to bye-bye land.

828
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:23,568
I'll pick up Pardee the same way.
- Right.

829
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:04,117
Some kids in the park found the body
about seven o'clock this morning.

830
00:49:04,763 --> 00:49:08,537
The doctor said he must have fallen off
the wall about ten o'clock last night.

831
00:49:09,117 --> 00:49:10,166
Killed instantly.

832
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,986
Has Miss Drukker been notified?

833
00:49:12,265 --> 00:49:14,269
No. I told them we would attend to that.

834
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:17,641
Drukker was our principle
clue and he falls off a wall.

835
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:20,237
Fallen off a wall.

836
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:22,766
A hunchback falls off a wall.

837
00:49:23,686 --> 00:49:25,647
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

838
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,952
Another mad Mother Goose rhyme.

839
00:49:28,492 --> 00:49:30,840
Well, I've sure got to
hand it to you, Mr Vance.

840
00:49:31,503 --> 00:49:32,455
You are right.

841
00:49:32,857 --> 00:49:34,984
Here's another one of these goofy notes.

842
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:40,555
I'll wake up some morning and think I'm
little Bo Peep and start chasing sheep.

843
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:42,920
'To the world'.

844
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:47,556
'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall'.

845
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:49,903
'All the King's horses
and all the King's men'.

846
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:54,196
'Cannot put Humpty
Dumpty together again'.

847
00:49:55,478 --> 00:49:56,398
'The Bishop'.

848
00:49:57,273 --> 00:49:58,064
Sergeant.

849
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,089
Did your men trail Pardee
and the professor last night?

850
00:50:01,863 --> 00:50:04,369
They tried to but they
lost them in the fog.

851
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:06,571
So they went back to the house to wait.

852
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,416
Sure enough, the professor
shows up in about ten minutes.

853
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:12,107
But Pardee.

854
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:15,212
He don't show up for
nearly half an hour.

855
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,261
Miss Drukker is dead.

856
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,024
Her poor heart gave out.

857
00:50:50,226 --> 00:50:51,308
Some sudden shock.

858
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:55,524
She must have known.

859
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:58,687
If we knew the exact
time it might help us.

860
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:02,931
I should say it was within a few
minutes of her brother's death.

861
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,795
Mrs Menzel.

862
00:51:08,507 --> 00:51:10,493
What time did Miss Drukker
usually go to bed?

863
00:51:11,422 --> 00:51:12,840
Ten o'clock, sir.

864
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,209
It was the doctor's orders.

865
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,609
May heaven forgive me.

866
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:23,028
I slept all last night myself.

867
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:42,074
I see it all now, Markham.

868
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:45,511
Miss Drukker went to take
her medicine before retiring.

869
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:47,367
Found her water carafe empty.

870
00:51:48,203 --> 00:51:49,511
Came in here to get some.

871
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:51,880
Was surprised by her brother's murderer.

872
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:54,774
Who then forced open this desk.

873
00:51:55,423 --> 00:51:57,992
To obtain something of Drukker's
that he knew to be of value.

874
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,655
That is all, Mrs Menzel.

875
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,930
We'll attend to the arrangements here.

876
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:13,705
I've asked Sergeant Heath.

877
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,960
To bring Mr Pardee over here.

878
00:52:16,768 --> 00:52:19,638
If you don't mind, Professor,
I'd like to question him before you.

879
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,257
I hope nothing I have said will
cast any reflections on Mr Pardee.

880
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:26,739
I should be terribly distressed.
- Not at all.

881
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:28,387
Merely a formality.

882
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,417
Professor Dillard.
- Good morning, Mr Pardee.

883
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:43,557
You have of course heard
of Mr Drukker's death?

884
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:45,934
I should like to ..

885
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,752
Won't you sit down?

886
00:52:48,894 --> 00:52:49,717
Thank you.

887
00:52:50,705 --> 00:52:52,562
I should like to ask
you a few questions.

888
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:56,478
What conversation did you have with
Mr Drukker in the park last night?

889
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:00,952
I went for a stroll in the park.

890
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:04,172
And meeting Professor Dillard
and Mr Drukker.

891
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,983
I stopped for a moment.

892
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:07,792
Not wishing to appear rude.

893
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,079
Drukker was in a beastly mood.

894
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,038
And made so many insulting
sneering remarks.

895
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,972
That I left.

896
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:16,750
Mr Pardee.

897
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:19,895
Can you explain to me why ..

898
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:24,055
Why you arrived home so much
later than Professor Dillard?

899
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:28,038
When you both left Mr Drukker
at the same time.

900
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,118
I sat down by the
79th Street entrance and ..

901
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,877
Smoked a cigarette.

902
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:37,206
Rather a foggy night
to sit on a park bench.

903
00:53:38,203 --> 00:53:39,536
Wasn't it, Mr Pardee?

904
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,868
Anyone see you sitting there?

905
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,420
Rather a foggy night to
depend on eyewitnesses.

906
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:48,805
Wasn't it, Mr Vance?

907
00:53:50,304 --> 00:53:51,654
Certainly, Mr Pardee.

908
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:53,996
My mistake.

909
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:57,053
That will be all.

910
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,737
For the present.

911
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,929
Dear me. Dear me.

912
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:10,067
This has been a wretched
business for you.

913
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:13,260
But I think it will soon be over.
- I just heard the sad news.

914
00:54:13,802 --> 00:54:15,304
A frightful business, isn't it?

915
00:54:15,742 --> 00:54:18,986
The Drukkers wiped out.
And more storybook nonsense to boot.

916
00:54:19,385 --> 00:54:20,729
Eric. Eric, please.

917
00:54:21,276 --> 00:54:22,529
May I be excused?

918
00:54:23,103 --> 00:54:24,592
Certainly, sir. Certainly.

919
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:28,951
Sergeant Heath tells me
that one of his men ..

920
00:54:29,153 --> 00:54:31,668
Saw you walking toward the
park last night at ten o'clock.

921
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:33,930
That you didn't return for an hour.

922
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,622
Just as a matter of form.

923
00:54:36,017 --> 00:54:37,422
To please the Sergeant here.

924
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:39,373
What were you doing in that time?

925
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:41,728
I mailed a letter at the
other end of the park.

926
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:43,203
Yeah?

927
00:54:44,512 --> 00:54:46,591
Well, where was the letter addressed?

928
00:54:47,012 --> 00:54:49,874
So that we can sure that
it gets there safely.

929
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:51,546
China.

930
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:53,717
China?

931
00:54:54,602 --> 00:54:55,199
Ha.

932
00:54:56,124 --> 00:54:58,757
A classmate of mine is an
instructor at the University of Peking.

933
00:54:59,108 --> 00:55:00,296
Arnesson.
- Yes?

934
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:03,735
What was the scientific formula
that Drukker was working on?

935
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:05,525
A tremendously important thing.

936
00:55:06,045 --> 00:55:07,722
It would have made him famous and rich.

937
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:09,768
And he kept a notebook?
- A very complete one.

938
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,439
Never let it out of his sight.

939
00:55:11,836 --> 00:55:13,693
The whole theory was
in that little book.

940
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,960
That must have been what was taken
from the top drawer of the desk.

941
00:55:18,422 --> 00:55:20,691
In Drukker's bedroom at
ten o'clock last night.

942
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:41,305
Drukker was always standing behind me.

943
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:43,528
Criticising me.

944
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:45,671
And I hated it.

945
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,081
Tonight.

946
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,123
It seems odd not to have him there.

947
00:55:57,346 --> 00:55:59,522
I looked round .. half a dozen times.

948
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:01,804
Expecting to see him there.

949
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:03,800
To .. to feel him.

950
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:05,776
Leaning over my shoulder.

951
00:56:10,044 --> 00:56:13,071
Perhaps the fact that you
disliked him so in life.

952
00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:16,602
Makes you regret his death the more.

953
00:56:17,973 --> 00:56:21,154
No-one knows the intricacies
of the human heart.

954
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:26,316
Why don't you go to bed early?

955
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:27,824
And try to relax.

956
00:56:28,658 --> 00:56:29,300
Yes.

957
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:33,059
Yes .. I believe I will.

958
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:50,557
Goodnight.

959
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:51,855
Goodnight.

960
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,495
Oh, it's you.

961
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:01,068
It's raining outside, sir.

962
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:03,959
Would you permit me to
escort you across the street?

963
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:06,093
Thank you. It is very good of you.

964
00:57:38,893 --> 00:57:40,362
Goodnight, dear.
- Goodnight.

965
00:57:41,778 --> 00:57:42,477
Eric.

966
00:57:43,268 --> 00:57:45,606
Are you sure the house
is safely locked up?

967
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:48,744
Of course, dear. It's all locked up.
Nobody can get in.

968
00:57:49,663 --> 00:57:50,745
You can rest easy.

969
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:53,734
Eric.

970
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:57,021
Who has the key to the attic door?

971
00:57:58,704 --> 00:58:01,179
I don't know, darling.
No-one has used it for years.

972
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,359
Tyne I suppose. Why?

973
00:58:04,054 --> 00:58:04,716
Well.

974
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:07,593
I heard a strange ..

975
00:58:08,157 --> 00:58:09,659
Tapping noise there last night.

976
00:58:09,952 --> 00:58:12,165
Nonsense, dear.
It couldn't be anything but pigeons.

977
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:15,427
You go to bed like a good little
girl and stop imagining things.

978
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,887
You're not nervous with me so near.

979
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:29,454
I will .. try not to be silly.

980
00:58:30,051 --> 00:58:31,617
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, darling.

981
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,455
Robin.

982
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:41,162
Sprigg.

983
00:59:43,729 --> 00:59:44,487
Drukker.

984
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:08,489
When the gong sounds once.

985
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,762
It will be exactly midnight.

986
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:16,036
"You're now back in the main studio."

987
01:00:16,432 --> 01:00:18,386
"And the orchestra will
resume its program."

988
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,297
Very well, Mr Markham.
- That's all.

989
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:22,179
I'll be hanged if I know
what to make of this note.

990
01:01:23,492 --> 01:01:25,298
'This is the house that Jack built'.

991
01:01:26,107 --> 01:01:27,283
'The Bishop'.

992
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:29,847
Well.

993
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:32,794
We'll go ahead with serving our
warrant for Pardee's arrest.

994
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:34,832
And worry about this note later.

995
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:36,838
Is the car waiting?
- Yes, sir.

996
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,251
There is your warrant.

997
01:01:50,617 --> 01:01:51,828
What's wrong, Manning?

998
01:01:52,399 --> 01:01:54,156
Mr Vance is inside waiting for you.

999
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:55,934
He said he would explain.

1000
01:02:06,358 --> 01:02:09,875
"Complete relaxation is
essential at a time like this."

1001
01:02:10,737 --> 01:02:14,081
"Lie flat on your back
with every muscle at rest."

1002
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,867
I always thought that
guy Vance was cuckoo.

1003
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,964
"Breathe deep."

1004
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:22,603
"Exhale."

1005
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,250
Morning.

1006
01:02:26,686 --> 01:02:28,414
This radio has been running all night.

1007
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:36,914
And now Pardee.

1008
01:02:38,304 --> 01:02:39,935
How did you know about this, Vance?

1009
01:02:41,185 --> 01:02:43,541
A reporter from the times
came to see me this morning.

1010
01:02:44,415 --> 01:02:46,785
He brought me the latest .. Bishop note.

1011
01:02:47,903 --> 01:02:51,703
It occurred to me at once that John
Pardee was Jack and he'd been murdered.

1012
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:56,371
So I sent the note along to you knowing
that you'd figure it out as I had and ..

1013
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,837
Come along here.

1014
01:02:58,224 --> 01:02:59,525
Perfectly simple reasoning.

1015
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:02,101
That's what we thought right away.
Didn't we, Mr Markham?

1016
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,047
Hardly.

1017
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:05,377
What do you make of it, Vance?

1018
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:07,775
It's as plain as the nose
on your face, Mr Markham.

1019
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:10,561
This guy Pardee wasn't murdered at all.

1020
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,453
He was The Bishop.

1021
01:03:13,204 --> 01:03:14,666
I suspected him right along.

1022
01:03:15,285 --> 01:03:17,326
And yesterday I put
Flaherty to watching him.

1023
01:03:17,939 --> 01:03:19,716
And when Pardee found out I had him.

1024
01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:22,589
He knew the game was up
and committed suicide.

1025
01:03:23,187 --> 01:03:24,446
It's very simple.

1026
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:28,605
Well, I guess we can call
The Bishop murder case closed.

1027
01:03:29,244 --> 01:03:30,621
Sergeant, what about the ..

1028
01:03:31,423 --> 01:03:32,763
The house that Jack built?

1029
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,865
You see. It collapsed when I
barely leaned against the table.

1030
01:03:43,963 --> 01:03:44,721
And yet.

1031
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,837
It didn't topple over when
Pardee fell across it.

1032
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,472
What of it?
- Don't you understand?

1033
01:03:51,254 --> 01:03:53,176
The house of cards was
not built by Pardee.

1034
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:54,757
But by the murderer.

1035
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:56,234
After Pardee was killed.

1036
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,099
That is just what I thought.

1037
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:05,540
You say that this chess table was
set up just as he left it last night?

1038
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,022
Precisely. He was the
last man to touch it.

1039
01:04:10,507 --> 01:04:11,293
Curious.

1040
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,484
These chessmen are set up ..

1041
01:04:17,906 --> 01:04:20,768
Just as they were the night he
resigned the contest at the club.

1042
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:23,479
The black bishop.

1043
01:04:23,949 --> 01:04:25,696
Is one move away from a checkmate.

1044
01:04:33,074 --> 01:04:35,253
Well, we mustn't detain
you any longer, Professor.

1045
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,081
No. He's had a very trying day.

1046
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:40,053
I am sorry Mr Arnesson
is not here tonight.

1047
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:46,503
Some students are doing an Ibsen play
and Arnesson has a passion for Ibsen.

1048
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:50,061
The Pretenders is the play
they are doing tonight.

1049
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:51,756
I have.

1050
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:55,075
I've just been reading
it over again myself.

1051
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,834
Am I intruding?
- Good evening.

1052
01:05:00,084 --> 01:05:01,456
No, my dear. Come right in.

1053
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:05,544
Mr Vance and Mr Markham
were just leaving.

1054
01:05:06,705 --> 01:05:10,873
They have been asking me if I have any
opinion to give on this tragic affair.

1055
01:05:12,048 --> 01:05:13,688
I feel as if we were ..

1056
01:05:14,471 --> 01:05:16,373
All living in a dreadful nightmare.

1057
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:18,481
And couldn't wake up.

1058
01:05:20,887 --> 01:05:21,645
Mr Vance.

1059
01:05:21,847 --> 01:05:26,465
Do you, as a student of human nature
share Arnesson's enthusiasm for Ibsen?

1060
01:05:27,025 --> 01:05:27,688
Well.

1061
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,565
I've read Ibsen a great deal and there's
no doubt he was a genius of high order.

1062
01:05:31,876 --> 01:05:33,313
I think he had his superiors.

1063
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:36,537
Then I know Mr Arnesson would enjoy
talking the play over with you.

1064
01:05:37,029 --> 01:05:38,636
The Pretenders is his favorite.

1065
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:42,335
Since you're unable to throw new light
on this mystifying affair I think ..

1066
01:05:42,728 --> 01:05:44,617
If you'll pardon us,
we ought to be going.

1067
01:05:45,043 --> 01:05:46,824
Goodnight, Miss Dillard. Goodnight, sir.

1068
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,279
Goodnight, Professor.

1069
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:54,455
I think I'll stay here
for a while, uncle.

1070
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,395
I'm too restless to go to bed.

1071
01:05:57,826 --> 01:05:58,908
There, my darling.

1072
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:00,552
You must remember.

1073
01:06:01,243 --> 01:06:04,125
That when one is young all wounds heal.

1074
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:07,115
And in time are forgotten.

1075
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,329
Goodnight, darling.

1076
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:11,904
Goodnight.

1077
01:07:03,932 --> 01:07:05,158
As I see it, Markham.

1078
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:10,451
The professor tried to convey a gesture
to us without putting it into words.

1079
01:07:13,494 --> 01:07:14,362
And we.

1080
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:16,258
We were supposed to guess.

1081
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:18,901
Yes.

1082
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:21,528
Yes.

1083
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,078
That's why he wanted to see us while
Arnesson was away at the Ibsen play.

1084
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,200
Ah, what a fool I've been.

1085
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:44,838
Markham.

1086
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:46,787
Markham, come here. Look at this.

1087
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:49,464
Arnesson.

1088
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:51,183
Bishop.

1089
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:54,229
That's what the bishop meant.
It had nothing to do with chess.

1090
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,540
He meant to tell us that
Arnesson was The Bishop.

1091
01:07:56,742 --> 01:07:57,533
Arnesson?

1092
01:07:57,981 --> 01:07:59,305
We haven't a moment to lose.

1093
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:01,734
We must get to that house at once.
- You're right, Markham.

1094
01:08:01,936 --> 01:08:05,083
Now we've been told who the murderer
is it makes us partners in crime ..

1095
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:08,176
If we let innocent people spend even
one hour under the same roof with him.

1096
01:08:08,378 --> 01:08:10,300
You had better telephone to Heath.
- Right.

1097
01:08:19,539 --> 01:08:20,233
Heath?

1098
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:22,661
Meet us at the Dillard home at once.

1099
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:25,329
Bring a couple of men with you.
- Okay, Chief.

1100
01:09:25,115 --> 01:09:26,235
George.
- Yes, sir?

1101
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:28,456
Go via the 69th Street entrance.
It's quicker.

1102
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:29,496
Yes, sir.

1103
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,680
Alright. Somebody is coming.

1104
01:11:22,114 --> 01:11:24,456
Forgive me, Professor, for
breaking in on you like this.

1105
01:11:24,707 --> 01:11:26,197
What does this mean, gentlemen?

1106
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:27,836
We've no time to explain now.

1107
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,830
Every moment of delay spells danger.

1108
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:30,863
Yes.

1109
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:33,104
Come in, gentlemen. Come in.

1110
01:11:35,913 --> 01:11:37,644
Put your hats down there please.

1111
01:11:39,482 --> 01:11:41,113
We want to see Mr Arnesson at once.

1112
01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:43,832
Pyne.

1113
01:11:44,645 --> 01:11:45,436
Yes, sir?

1114
01:11:46,478 --> 01:11:49,625
These gentlemen wish to see Mr Arnesson.
Go to his room and call him.

1115
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:51,831
Yes, sir.

1116
01:11:52,489 --> 01:11:54,249
Mr Vance found what was disturbing you.

1117
01:11:54,717 --> 01:11:56,089
After we left here tonight.

1118
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:58,960
He showed me his copy of
the Ibsen play you referred to.

1119
01:11:59,807 --> 01:12:01,992
For days, that play has been on my mind.

1120
01:12:02,678 --> 01:12:04,189
Poisoning every thought.

1121
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:08,024
What does it mean?
- It means you have led us to the truth.

1122
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,739
Professor Dillard.

1123
01:12:10,232 --> 01:12:12,214
Mr Arnesson is not in his room, sir.

1124
01:12:13,781 --> 01:12:14,443
Pyne.

1125
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,981
See if Miss Dillard is in her room.

1126
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:18,354
Yes, sir.

1127
01:12:18,606 --> 01:12:20,657
I am sorry, sir.
But it's absolutely necessary.

1128
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:22,103
Alright, Pyne.

1129
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:23,542
Yes, sir.

1130
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,226
Can't we keep this poor
child out of this terrible affair?

1131
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:28,145
Her heart is heavy enough already.

1132
01:12:28,398 --> 01:12:30,449
I don't see why we should
disturb Miss Dillard.

1133
01:12:30,897 --> 01:12:33,288
After all, it's Arnesson we're after.
- Look here, Markham.

1134
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,745
It's too late to consider
anyone leaving now.

1135
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,973
But the information
that we have on hand.

1136
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:40,032
Means we must not
leave a stone unturned.

1137
01:12:41,045 --> 01:12:41,674
Sir!

1138
01:12:41,997 --> 01:12:44,735
Miss Dillard's room
has not been slept in.

1139
01:12:46,183 --> 01:12:48,459
Then, Professor.
Much as I regret taking drastic steps.

1140
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:51,065
It will be necessary for
us to search this house.

1141
01:12:51,707 --> 01:12:53,017
Come on, Heath. Upstairs.

1142
01:12:58,188 --> 01:13:00,207
Arnesson's room is at
the end of the corridor.

1143
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:06,653
Mr Vance, you lead the way.
Me and my men are right behind you.

1144
01:13:07,664 --> 01:13:09,101
Which is Miss Dillard's room?

1145
01:13:09,732 --> 01:13:10,714
This one here.

1146
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:13,782
Take one man and look around it.
- Come with me, Sweeney.

1147
01:13:13,984 --> 01:13:14,613
And.

1148
01:13:15,049 --> 01:13:15,954
Mr Arnesson?

1149
01:13:16,427 --> 01:13:17,412
That one there.

1150
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:19,995
Come along, Markham.

1151
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:22,277
Careful, Collins.

1152
01:13:22,915 --> 01:13:23,965
Watch your step.

1153
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,270
It's nothing but the wind.

1154
01:13:39,555 --> 01:13:40,808
He obviously isn't here.

1155
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,940
Alright, let's get through
the rest of the house.

1156
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:45,721
I could have sworn that he did
not leave the house this evening.

1157
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:47,009
Can I do anything?

1158
01:13:47,211 --> 01:13:48,768
There's nothing in those two rooms.

1159
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,667
Where does that door lead to?
- To the attic. But it is never used.

1160
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:53,341
Who has the key?
- Pyne.

1161
01:13:53,621 --> 01:13:55,187
Pyne, bring the key to the attic.

1162
01:13:55,814 --> 01:13:57,295
I lost it, sir.
- Lost it?

1163
01:13:57,893 --> 01:14:00,036
Very well. We'll break it open.
- Philo, are you mad?

1164
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:01,559
You can't without a warrant.

1165
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:04,366
I'll search that attic if I have to
spend the rest of my life in jail.

1166
01:14:04,568 --> 01:14:07,236
It's alright, Markham. Mr Vance must
do whatever he thinks necessary.

1167
01:14:07,438 --> 01:14:09,295
Alright. Collins, Sweeney.
Break it down.

1168
01:14:29,066 --> 01:14:29,836
A lamp.

1169
01:14:37,374 --> 01:14:38,361
Alright. Hold it.

1170
01:14:53,013 --> 01:14:55,003
The chimney of this lamp is still warm.

1171
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,239
You were certainly
justified in breaking in here.

1172
01:15:01,427 --> 01:15:02,476
I agree with you.

1173
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:03,773
Markham.

1174
01:15:04,512 --> 01:15:05,174
This.

1175
01:15:05,775 --> 01:15:07,356
This is incredible.

1176
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:23,192
Now this lamp was put here.

1177
01:15:24,677 --> 01:15:26,218
In order to use the light.

1178
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:28,347
Somewhere in this radius.

1179
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,465
Now let me see.

1180
01:16:24,902 --> 01:16:27,735
And Arnesson told you there never
was a typewriter in this house.

1181
01:16:43,551 --> 01:16:46,432
The same type as that used in
The Bishop murder notes.

1182
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,596
I would not have believed it.

1183
01:16:54,025 --> 01:16:56,397
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

1184
01:17:36,668 --> 01:17:38,073
I don't understand, Markham.

1185
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:40,693
We can't accomplish anything more now.

1186
01:17:41,607 --> 01:17:43,596
We'd better go downstairs
and wait for Arnesson.

1187
01:17:43,798 --> 01:17:44,718
But my niece?

1188
01:17:45,349 --> 01:17:47,401
You're not going to abandon
the search for her?

1189
01:17:48,144 --> 01:17:50,133
Nothing matters until we find her.

1190
01:17:51,953 --> 01:17:52,808
I warn you.

1191
01:17:53,297 --> 01:17:55,141
If she's come to any harm
through, Arnesson ..

1192
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:57,122
I shall not be responsible
for my actions.

1193
01:17:57,324 --> 01:17:58,955
Please control yourself, Professor.

1194
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,487
We all understand how deeply you feel.

1195
01:18:01,874 --> 01:18:04,459
But we cannot find your niece
except through Arnesson.

1196
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:07,770
And you must control
yourself when you see him.

1197
01:18:08,986 --> 01:18:10,739
Let us handle this in our own way.

1198
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:17,259
Very well, gentlemen.

1199
01:18:19,057 --> 01:18:21,177
Take charge of the typewriter, boys.
- Yes, sir.

1200
01:18:26,727 --> 01:18:27,938
Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?

1201
01:18:32,376 --> 01:18:32,973
No.

1202
01:18:37,494 --> 01:18:38,285
Yes, sir.

1203
01:18:44,191 --> 01:18:45,757
Certainly a harrowing experience.

1204
01:18:47,711 --> 01:18:49,114
I hope for all our sakes.

1205
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:51,141
That Arnesson will come back soon.

1206
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,164
Has it occurred to you that ..

1207
01:18:56,324 --> 01:18:57,727
He may not come back?

1208
01:18:58,749 --> 01:18:59,798
What do you mean?

1209
01:19:00,822 --> 01:19:01,387
I.

1210
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:03,687
I have often heard him quote.

1211
01:19:04,262 --> 01:19:05,921
Nietzsche's famous words.

1212
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,017
'One should .. die proudly'.

1213
01:19:11,223 --> 01:19:13,229
When it is no longer possible ..

1214
01:19:14,237 --> 01:19:15,538
To live proudly.

1215
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:17,690
You mean suicide?

1216
01:19:18,305 --> 01:19:21,908
If he were convinced that the evidence
against him was strong enough.

1217
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:25,773
Is Mr Arnesson in the habit of leaving
the house at this hour of the night?

1218
01:19:26,297 --> 01:19:27,951
Only during the last two weeks.

1219
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:31,463
Since then, he's been apt
to disappear at odd hours.

1220
01:19:31,985 --> 01:19:33,551
And reappear at even odder hours.

1221
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:34,903
Eric.
- Careful.

1222
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:42,758
You see the words 'The Bishop'?

1223
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:44,106
Written there.

1224
01:19:45,037 --> 01:19:47,049
Do you recognise the type, Mr Arnesson?

1225
01:19:54,829 --> 01:19:55,749
I thought so.

1226
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,869
We found the typewriter
on which this was written.

1227
01:20:00,459 --> 01:20:02,058
Hidden in the attic of this house.

1228
01:20:02,974 --> 01:20:03,636
Well.

1229
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:06,943
I don't see that you have a cast-iron
case against anyone at that.

1230
01:20:07,896 --> 01:20:10,922
After all, a typewriter isn't a
thing that only fits one person.

1231
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:15,875
You must do better than that, Mr Vance.
- I assure you, Mr Arnesson, we know ..

1232
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:17,610
Who is guilty.

1233
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:20,365
Really, you almost terrify me.

1234
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,642
By any chance.

1235
01:20:23,137 --> 01:20:27,456
I happened to be the murderer I should
be almost inclined to admit defeat.

1236
01:20:28,559 --> 01:20:31,729
But since you know who
The Bishop is, why all this palaver?

1237
01:20:32,519 --> 01:20:33,310
Mr Vance.

1238
01:20:35,763 --> 01:20:38,279
You were right.
The girl was in the cupola.

1239
01:20:38,852 --> 01:20:40,844
Not hurt. But unconscious from shock.

1240
01:21:09,106 --> 01:21:10,906
And the worst of it is, Mr Vance.

1241
01:21:11,648 --> 01:21:13,294
She don't know who did it.

1242
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,706
Very good, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

1243
01:21:18,505 --> 01:21:19,699
Well, Professor.

1244
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:23,031
It's been a very tiring
night for all of us.

1245
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:27,734
I'm sure we'd be most grateful if you
offer us a glass of your excellent port.

1246
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:29,963
Why certainly.

1247
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:33,018
I'm not quite myself tonight.
- Thank you, sir.

1248
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:36,903
Mr Markham.
- Thank you.

1249
01:21:39,287 --> 01:21:41,370
I hope this horrible business
will soon be over.

1250
01:21:41,674 --> 01:21:42,602
For your sake.

1251
01:21:42,804 --> 01:21:44,273
You're bearing up wonderfully.

1252
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:46,476
You would put to shame
a man half your years.

1253
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:51,904
Well.

1254
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:56,588
Since when have I been a teetotaller?

1255
01:21:57,447 --> 01:21:58,399
Help yourself.

1256
01:22:01,845 --> 01:22:02,603
Alright.

1257
01:22:23,256 --> 01:22:25,730
While you were talking
to Mr Markham just now.

1258
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:28,205
I changed the wine glasses.

1259
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,987
The glass from which
you are about to drink.

1260
01:22:32,404 --> 01:22:34,254
The one you prepared for Mr Arnesson.

1261
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:37,462
I trust it makes no difference to you?

1262
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,545
What would you say if I told you ..

1263
01:22:42,922 --> 01:22:44,391
That we have found your niece?

1264
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,040
And that in spite of all precautions ..

1265
01:22:47,519 --> 01:22:49,578
She will recognize the
man who seized her.

1266
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:56,453
And I had everything so perfect.

1267
01:22:57,571 --> 01:22:59,489
So easy to keep myself innocent.

1268
01:23:00,346 --> 01:23:03,275
To throw the guilt from one
to another until it struck.

1269
01:23:03,717 --> 01:23:05,498
I planned it from the beginning ..

1270
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:06,604
On you.

1271
01:23:07,576 --> 01:23:10,534
You, who robbed me of the
only things that I lived for.

1272
01:23:11,645 --> 01:23:13,412
My fame as a scientist.

1273
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,623
The affections of my niece.

1274
01:23:18,604 --> 01:23:21,988
The only creature in the
whole world that I loved.

1275
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:23,511
Now.

1276
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:28,863
Now you rob me of the triumph
of seeing you sent to the chair.

1277
01:23:32,656 --> 01:23:34,028
It could have been perfect.

1278
01:23:35,661 --> 01:23:36,693
Perfect.

1279
01:23:38,326 --> 01:23:39,414
But for you.

1280
01:23:40,455 --> 01:23:41,149
Fools.

1281
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:42,506
Idiots.

1282
01:23:42,973 --> 01:23:44,603
Children, all of you.

1283
01:23:46,723 --> 01:23:48,976
Baffled by Mother Goose.

1284
01:23:50,926 --> 01:23:53,901
Three blind .. mice.

1285
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,799
Vance, don't let him drink it.

1286
01:24:06,931 --> 01:24:08,691
Do you realize what you've done, Vance?

1287
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:10,132
This is murder.

1288
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,774
Here is the glass that he
prepared for Mr Arnesson.

1289
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:21,551
It was the poison that fermented in
his own diseased brain that killed him.

1290
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:22,963
Fear.

1291
01:24:23,924 --> 01:24:27,049
Vance. I've suffered tortures.
For heaven's sake, where is Belle?

1292
01:24:27,259 --> 01:24:28,553
That's alright, Arnesson.

1293
01:24:28,755 --> 01:24:30,770
She'll be here in a minute. She ..

1294
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:33,501
She surprised the professor
in the act tonight.

1295
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:36,939
He locked her up safely until
he could get you out of the way.

1296
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,159
She was in no real danger.

1297
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:42,831
She was the one person in the world
that he never would have harmed.

1298
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,234
He certainly prepared
us for your suicide.

1299
01:24:46,496 --> 01:24:49,918
You see, he could then explain things in
his own way and the only one left ..

1300
01:24:50,506 --> 01:24:51,808
For her to cling to.

1301
01:24:52,508 --> 01:24:53,428
Oh yes.

1302
01:24:54,252 --> 01:24:55,284
One other point.

1303
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:57,769
She did not recognise him.
- Why?

1304
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:02,552
That was a little dramatic
license on my part.

1305
01:25:03,313 --> 01:25:05,784
Arnesson, I owe you an apology
for the way I've treated you.

1306
01:25:06,123 --> 01:25:07,744
No apology necessary, old son.

1307
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,853
I knew you didn't have your eye on me.

1308
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:13,089
It gave me a terrible shock but of
course I knew I had to play up to it.

1309
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:16,721
I didn't know what you were after but
I followed your cues as far as possible.

1310
01:25:17,303 --> 01:25:19,273
I hope I didn't bungle the job.
- Play up?

1311
01:25:19,793 --> 01:25:20,842
What do you mean?

1312
01:25:25,489 --> 01:25:27,725
'Pretend you are guilty.
Trust me and play up'

1313
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:31,232
Well, no wonder you acted guilty.

1314
01:25:31,872 --> 01:25:32,857
Tell me, Vance.

1315
01:25:33,656 --> 01:25:36,401
How did you know that the professor
intended to poison Arnesson?

1316
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:38,726
When I followed you down
the stairs just now.

1317
01:25:38,928 --> 01:25:40,785
And heard him preparing
you so carefully.

1318
01:25:41,148 --> 01:25:42,441
For Arnesson's suicide.

1319
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:44,412
I was more than ever on my guard.

1320
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:46,151
I gave him his opportunity.

1321
01:25:46,486 --> 01:25:47,955
By going to Heath at the door.

1322
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,190
And watched him.

1323
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:52,282
And this.

1324
01:25:53,259 --> 01:25:54,728
Of course, I knew he hated me.

1325
01:25:55,044 --> 01:25:56,805
He's been losing his intellectual grip.

1326
01:25:57,232 --> 01:26:00,438
For months I've been doing all his
work for him and he loathes me for it.

1327
01:26:00,933 --> 01:26:03,234
Then too, he felt I was
robbing him of Belle.

1328
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:07,742
But what diabolic hatred
to kill four men ..

1329
01:26:08,321 --> 01:26:10,210
In order to send me
to the electric chair.

1330
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,939
The four were not intentional.

1331
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,289
He meant to hang only
the Robin murder on you.

1332
01:26:14,893 --> 01:26:16,072
Something went wrong.

1333
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:18,359
You had an alibi that
he didn't reckon on.

1334
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,869
Sprigg was the next.
That seemed to him the perfect crime.

1335
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,071
He was your pupil and close friend.

1336
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:26,526
And everything went off
just as he had planned it.

1337
01:26:27,008 --> 01:26:27,799
But then.

1338
01:26:28,386 --> 01:26:30,084
He made the frightening discovery ..

1339
01:26:30,637 --> 01:26:32,693
That Drukker had seen him kill Robin.

1340
01:26:33,953 --> 01:26:35,261
Miss Drukker too perhaps.

1341
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:39,999
That knowledge destroyed what little
sanity was left in his diseased brain.

1342
01:26:40,398 --> 01:26:41,592
And he killed Pardee.

1343
01:26:42,168 --> 01:26:43,896
He became a killer with one obsession.

1344
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:46,092
To see you convicted of these murders.

1345
01:26:46,471 --> 01:26:48,239
And paying the supreme penalty.

1346
01:26:48,966 --> 01:26:49,628
Eric.

1347
01:26:50,577 --> 01:26:52,252
Belle, my poor darling.

1348
01:26:56,997 --> 01:26:59,504
Well, Mr Vance. We did it again.

1349
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:01,415
Don't drink that, Sergeant.

1350
01:27:01,617 --> 01:27:03,150
Why not?
- It's poisoned.

1351
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:07,223
And I need it for evidence.

1352
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:08,632
Well.

1353
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,982
Thank you, Sergeant,
for your assistance.

1354
01:27:12,606 --> 01:27:15,451
Well, you are a good
detective too, Mr Vance.

1355
01:27:23,246 --> 01:27:24,351
..s-d..
