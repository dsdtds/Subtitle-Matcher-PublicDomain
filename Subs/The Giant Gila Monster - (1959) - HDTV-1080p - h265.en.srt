1
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:10,348
In the enormity of the West,

2
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:15,348
there are still vast and
virtually unexplored regions

3
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,908
bleak and desolate,

4
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:20,678
where no human ever goes,

5
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,661
and no life is ever seen.

6
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:27,631
It is as though the land
had been posted by God.

7
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:32,008
It is in these lonely areas

8
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:36,228
of impenetrable forest and dark shadows

9
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:38,971
that the Gila monster still lives.

10
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,988
How large the dreaded Gila
monster grows no man can say.

11
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,241
- Say, here come Gordy and Jennie.

12
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:41,811
- Hey, gang!

13
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:42,998
- Hey, where've you been?
- Hi!

14
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,322
- You better cool that foot jazz.

15
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:46,155
- How's that?
- What about that?

16
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:47,288
- Well, Spook will be charging you

17
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,834
with an entertainment plan.

18
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,048
- He charges us for everything else.

19
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,268
- Hi, Spook.
- Hi, kids.

20
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:54,273
Hey, how are
the new parts on the bomb?

21
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:16,221
- Gordon. Jennie.

22
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,321
Where's Pat and Liz?

23
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,658
I thought we'd be the last ones here.

24
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,798
- Yeah, they're probably out
spooking around somewhere.

25
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:23,268
- Maybe they broke down.

26
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,318
- Not in his heap.

27
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,452
I worked on myself.

28
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:27,898
- That makes it too cool.

29
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:29,058
- That wouldn't make any difference

30
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,238
if they goofed a speed shift or something.

31
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:33,577
- Yeah, and that squirrel is
just the one that could do it.

32
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,181
- Oh, wonderful.

33
00:03:37,248 --> 00:03:39,168
- What kept you so long, Lisa?

34
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,538
- Oh, Mr. Wheeler smoked two cigars

35
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:42,608
at the table after dinner,

36
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:46,015
and I could not get at the
dishes until he was through.

37
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,674
- What time did Pat leave?

38
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:49,548
- Pat did not come home for dinner.

39
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:52,045
That's why his father was so upset.

40
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,733
Who's that?

41
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,816
- There's Old Man Harris.

42
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:04,221
- Man, that fellow has a jewel of a car.

43
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:06,838
- Well, look then.

44
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:17,835
- Hey.
- Hi, Mr. Harris.

45
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:19,957
- Hi, Mr. Harris.
- Hi, how you doing?

46
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:21,911
- Hey, you wanna sell that Deuce?

47
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:28,288
- Why you fellers always
asking me to buy my car?

48
00:04:28,288 --> 00:04:30,981
- That 32 is the ideal
stock to convert to a bomb.

49
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:33,888
- Buying a car, son,

50
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,688
is just like getting married

51
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,102
or going to New York City.

52
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,428
Everybody ought to do it once,

53
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:41,632
but nobody ought to do it twice.

54
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,858
- Hey, I can get you a good price on that.

55
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:52,518
- Paid $695 for that car 26 years ago.

56
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:55,218
Ten years ago it wasn't worth a dime.

57
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:57,981
Last month I turned down $100 for it.

58
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:01,942
When it gets back up to
$695 again, I'll sell it.

59
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,138
Hey, Spook.

60
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,993
Gimme a snort of that there sode pop.

61
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:13,308
- Hey, gang, you know this will be

62
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:15,008
Lisa's first trip to a drive-in?

63
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:17,458
- Oh, we have drive-ins in France, too.

64
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,638
- Yeah?
- Yes.

65
00:05:18,638 --> 00:05:20,168
I went twice with my brother

66
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:21,387
on his motor scooter.

67
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,008
Oh, her brother

68
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,488
on a motor scooter.
- On a motor scoter!

69
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:28,381
Now that's my idea of
absolutely nothing to do.

70
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:29,894
Yeah, okay, come on let's go.

71
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,414
Don't be too late.

72
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,698
- We're gonna pull on out.

73
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:36,268
- Hey Chase, if the roads clear,

74
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,928
I'll drag you to Bartonelle's Corner.

75
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,721
- I can't, I'm driving barefoot.

76
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,228
You still
running on that old rubber?

77
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:44,538
- Yeah.

78
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,578
Hey Spook, when Pat and Liz get here,

79
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,168
will you tell them that
we went to the drive-in

80
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,368
and for them to catch up?

81
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,988
Thank you.
- We sure will.

82
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,611
- And I'll give you $150.

83
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,255
- You're talking like my foot's asleep.

84
00:06:00,553 --> 00:06:02,312
Who does he think he's playing with, kids?

85
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:32,081
- Sheriff.

86
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,348
- What's the trouble, Mr. Wheeler?

87
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,888
- Pat didn't come home last night.

88
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,048
- He didn't?

89
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,978
- No, evidently, he was
out with Liz Humphries.

90
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:39,278
She didn't come home either.

91
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:40,111
- Oh?

92
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,328
- I want you to find out why,

93
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:45,838
and don't leave a stone
unturned in doing so.

94
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,488
Do I make myself clear?

95
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:48,888
- I understood, Mr. Wheeler.

96
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:52,681
There weren't any wrecks
reported last night.

97
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,668
Your son Pat he's about 19, isn't he?

98
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:57,501
- That's right.

99
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,448
- Just a year older than
I was when I got married.

100
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:01,648
- You think they eloped?

101
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,788
He wouldn't dare.

102
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:06,518
- I didn't say that.

103
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:08,128
But if they were out together all night,

104
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,658
you better hope they have.

105
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:11,208
- This is a missing person's report,

106
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,908
and I wanna know what
you're gonna do about it.

107
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:17,198
- Well, I'll send in an APB
on both of them and the car.

108
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:18,308
I don't think it'll do much good

109
00:07:18,308 --> 00:07:19,368
if they went out to get married.

110
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,308
They'd already be across the state line.

111
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,858
- Why, if he'd gotten
married, I'll wring his neck.

112
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:27,188
If you ask me it's that Chase Winstead.

113
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:28,388
He's older than the others.

114
00:07:28,388 --> 00:07:30,188
Sets them all wrong.

115
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:33,378
Why, he's got more influence
on Pat than I have.

116
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:35,988
- Chase Winstead does more
about keeping them in line

117
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,008
than getting them in trouble than I know.

118
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,708
He supported his mother and sister

119
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,578
ever since his dad died
on one of your drill rigs.

120
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,548
Your son could take a page
out of his book, Mr. Wheeler.

121
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,968
- When I get through with my son,

122
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,808
he won't have a book left.

123
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,038
Now you locate him or I'll have your job.

124
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,768
- If you wanna be the only peace officer

125
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:55,788
in 10,000 square miles
and 1,000 miles of road,

126
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:57,001
you're welcome to it.

127
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,058
I'll do everything I can to locate

128
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,411
both of them, Mr. Wheeler.

129
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:15,731
- Hi, Sheriff.

130
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:17,688
Hi, Chase.

131
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:24,728
- Got a new set of wheels.

132
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:26,830
- Yeah, new to me.

133
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,138
With that clunker I had,

134
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:31,158
I'd be chasing you boys on a
bicycle in a couple of days.

135
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,568
- Oh, come on, Sheriff.

136
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:33,648
Outside of Pat Wheeler,

137
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:35,898
we haven't had a ticket in
our gang in eight months.

138
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,401
- Oh, I was just kidding.

139
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:41,643
- What's the mileage on it?

140
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:44,088
- Oh, about 35,000.

141
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,808
County bought it from the state.

142
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,691
Those lucky stiffs on highway
get a new car every year.

143
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:50,848
- Let me have it for a couple of days,

144
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:51,918
and I'll tune it up for you.

145
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:54,338
- Oh, you'd choke it off,

146
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:55,878
so I could never catch you!

147
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:59,218
- You couldn't get that
deuce of mine right now!

148
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:01,088
Now let me have that patrol car.

149
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:04,148
I'll turn it into a slingshot
that'll catch anything.

150
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:05,148
- We'll make a deal.

151
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:12,420
Chase?

152
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:17,718
Just between us Liz
Humphries and Pat Wheeler

153
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:19,288
didn't get home last night.

154
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,528
- Oh?

155
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,068
They were supposed to
meet us at the drive-in,

156
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,458
but they didn't show up.

157
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,761
We wondered what happened.

158
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,851
- Were they in any kind of trouble?

159
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:30,668
- What do you mean?

160
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:32,911
- You know.

161
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,840
- Oh.

162
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,411
No, I don't think so.

163
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,881
- Chase, level with me.

164
00:09:43,098 --> 00:09:45,368
- I'm almost positive they
weren't in any trouble.

165
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,201
I'd know.

166
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,761
- Do you think they might
have run off to get married?

167
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:54,068
- Well, they've been going
steady for over a year now,

168
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:56,018
and I know they talked about it, but...

169
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:59,648
No, not like for right now.

170
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,441
- Did Pat have any money stashed?

171
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,018
Yeah, some.

172
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,708
- Like how much?

173
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,758
- Well, he was talking about getting

174
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,228
a new blower and a mill.

175
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:12,048
That's about 500 bucks.

176
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:14,398
- Where did he get that kind of money?

177
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:15,958
- He saved it.

178
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,468
His old man gives him a good allowance

179
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:19,288
when he's not mad at him.

180
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,468
- What bank does he use?

181
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:22,348
- None.

182
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,098
He's afraid his did would find out.

183
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:28,087
- He could have been saving it
to get married, couldn't he?

184
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:28,920
- It's his money.

185
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,701
I guess he could do
whatever he wants with it.

186
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,741
But, you know, if he eloped,

187
00:10:34,658 --> 00:10:37,148
his old man would put him down flat.

188
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:38,058
- I know.

189
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,148
But Pat's smart enough
to provide for himself

190
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,548
till the old man cooled off.

191
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,738
- Pat's the only one of the
gang I couldn't slow down.

192
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,938
Did you check the hospitals?

193
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,308
- Yeah.

194
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:53,098
Where could I find the rest of the gang?

195
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:54,768
- Well, I don't know about Bob and Gordy,

196
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,078
but Chuck and Rick went over to Easton.

197
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,358
They wanted to check with the Wheel Cats

198
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,008
about next Saturday night's platter party.

199
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,218
- Next Saturday night?

200
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:02,358
- Yeah.

201
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:05,948
- You warn the gang I'll be
cruising that pass that night.

202
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:07,788
No dragging.

203
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,548
- Okay, I'll tell them.

204
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:12,391
- You get any postcards
from those two, let me know.

205
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:27,508
- Hi, Sheriff.

206
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:28,341
- Hi, Kelly.

207
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:37,728
Howdy, Ebb.
- Hello, Sheriff.

208
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,468
- I don't have any word
for you, Mrs. Humphries.

209
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:40,908
- She's a good girl, Sheriff.

210
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,808
I ain't worried.

211
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,458
- How come you drove around
the truck all night then?

212
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,288
- You don't think she
might have eloped, do you?

213
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:51,128
- Could be, she's pretty close
mouthed about her affairs.

214
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,358
- More thank likes of Wheeler.

215
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,838
Ain't marrying our kind of folks.

216
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:55,768
- You don't have a phone,

217
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:56,638
so I just dropped around

218
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,808
to let you know I'm
doing everything I can.

219
00:11:58,808 --> 00:11:59,641
- We know that, Sheriff,

220
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,638
and we sure do appreciate it.

221
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,138
- Sorry Liz put you to so much trouble.

222
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,268
- It's never any trouble
looking after kids.

223
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,988
- Let me know if I can help, Sheriff.

224
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,493
- Thanks, Ebb.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

225
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:10,361
- Goodbye.

226
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,998
Yes, we gotta
quit worrying this way.

227
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:12,831
We gotta trust in the Lord.

228
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:13,927
We gotta pray.

229
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:22,911
- Harris.

230
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,158
- Morning, Sheriff.

231
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:25,454
- Let me smell your breath.

232
00:12:27,738 --> 00:12:29,256
Okay, go ahead.

233
00:12:29,256 --> 00:12:30,710
- Okay.

234
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:42,788
- Hi, Chase.
- Hi.

235
00:12:42,788 --> 00:12:44,778
- Did you get that diesel tracker fixed?

236
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:45,898
- Yeah, she's all set.

237
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,458
- Good.

238
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,440
My boy, that's one trip I'm glad

239
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,808
I don't have to make very often.

240
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:52,738
- The stuff heavy I'll help you unload.

241
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,728
- No, not heavy.

242
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,038
It's hot.

243
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:57,075
Wheeler's sinking another oil well,

244
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,125
and he's afraid of fire when it comes in.

245
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,738
There's four quarts of nitroglycerin

246
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,428
out there in that cab.

247
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:06,981
He wants us to keep it out
back in the storehouse.

248
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:10,588
- You know, last winter
when number 21 came in,

249
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:13,118
I made a $100 for that stuff.

250
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:14,940
Dad showed me how to use it.

251
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,084
It's not so bad,

252
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:18,598
as long as it doesn't get nervous.

253
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,033
- Well, I'm sorry I was late getting back.

254
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:21,866
But with that cargo,

255
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:23,898
I was afraid to do over
five miles an hour.

256
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:27,258
- Oh, it's not so dangerous

257
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,031
as long as it's in a nitro case.

258
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:32,098
- But I took these out of the case!

259
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,398
- Holy smoke.

260
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,318
You're lucky to be standing
here talking about it!

261
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:36,518
I'll put it in the shed!

262
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:52,798
- Much action this afternoon?

263
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,098
- Sheriff got a new patrol car.

264
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:56,101
We'll get a tune-up job out of that.

265
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:58,720
- Is that nitro safe out there?

266
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:00,858
- Well, if it decides to blow,

267
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,197
it's not safe anywhere.

268
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:08,458
I'll get it.

269
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,078
- That's not our ring.

270
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:11,918
- No, it's the sheriff's.

271
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:12,751
If there's been a wreck,

272
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,758
I get a tow job out of it.

273
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:16,436
I also have a deal with the
ambulance if someone's hurt.

274
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,418
- You work all the
angles, don't you, Chase?

275
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,031
- Mr. Compton, I have to.

276
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:25,731
Hello, Sheriff?

277
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,996
Yes.

278
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,888
I'm 12 miles out
beyond the red schoolhouse

279
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:32,213
a car has run into the ditch.

280
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:33,148
Oh?

281
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:35,468
Yeah, it's a pretty bad wreck.

282
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:36,458
What kind of a car?

283
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,328
Well, it's a sedan.

284
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:39,631
Pontiac, I believe.

285
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:43,288
Someone could've been hurt pretty bad.

286
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,278
Maybe you should get
out there pretty quick.

287
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:47,081
Did you stop and investigate?

288
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,618
- There's been a wreck
12 miles out of town.

289
00:14:53,618 --> 00:14:54,638
Where's the wrecker?

290
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:55,648
- Home.

291
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,588
I used the A-frame to build
a doggone rock garden.

292
00:14:58,588 --> 00:14:59,758
Look, you take your car

293
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:01,058
and keep the city wreckers off.

294
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:02,858
I'll get our wrecker and follow you.

295
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,178
- I wondered who was on
that party line a while ago.

296
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:32,738
- Well, it cost me to get
on that line with you.

297
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:34,838
I figured since it was on
your call station anyway,

298
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:35,671
you wouldn't care.

299
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:36,959
- Yeah.

300
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,048
This is a pretty good one.

301
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:38,881
Yeah.

302
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:44,168
This engine's still warm.

303
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:46,248
- Say, did you see the
skid marks out here?

304
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:48,953
They go at a direct right angle
to the direction of travel.

305
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:51,991
- Yeah.

306
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:54,438
No digs in the macadam either.

307
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:00,568
Somebody was hurt in here.

308
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,378
There's blood all over the upholstery.

309
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,448
Let's take a look around.

310
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:04,478
- I've already looked around.

311
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:06,098
There's nobody here.

312
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,368
- Real good?

313
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:08,281
- Yeah, real good.

314
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:11,798
Well, maybe somebody came
by and picked them up.

315
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:14,188
It could've been the people who called in.

316
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:16,001
- Nah, they'd have said something.

317
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,858
- Then why didn't they wait?

318
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,848
- People will go to the
trouble to report an accident,

319
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:21,838
but they won't stay around.

320
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,588
Don't want to fill out the reports.

321
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,328
- So what do you do now?

322
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:29,218
- Well, I'll take the license
number and engine number.

323
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:30,308
Call headquarters.

324
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:31,958
Maybe they've got a line on them.

325
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,338
Chase, how are your headlights?

326
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:41,641
- Fine, just fine.

327
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,450
- Both of them burning?

328
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,208
How many times have I warned you

329
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,938
about getting that headlamp fixed?

330
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,212
- Twice.

331
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,928
But the first time it
was just a suggestion.

332
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,291
- Seal beam only costs $4.

333
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:01,468
- Well, I had some unexpected expenses.

334
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:02,408
- Oh?

335
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,973
Missy?

336
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:05,048
- Yeah, the doctor said she'd be able

337
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,358
to start walking again pretty soon,

338
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,208
and it took all the money I had

339
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,308
to make a part down payment on her braces.

340
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:18,978
- You know, I think this
is a complete washout.

341
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:20,678
You've probably got a screwdriver.

342
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:24,628
I don't think the insurance company

343
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,328
would miss one of those headlamps.

344
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,918
Well, I got the whole story.

345
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,338
Car was stolen out of state,

346
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:46,528
and the plates were stolen in state.

347
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:48,248
So whoever stole it had
beat it, hurt or not,

348
00:18:48,248 --> 00:18:50,198
as long as they could navigate.

349
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,728
- Well, is there anything
else I can do here, Sheriff?

350
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,458
If not, I'll get this
on back to the garage.

351
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,291
- No, go ahead.

352
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,028
Chase, will you give me a hand?

353
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:01,038
I wanna take some pictures
of those skid marks.

354
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:02,838
You stand by them for scale.

355
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:03,808
- Sure, glad to, Sheriff.

356
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:04,868
- Good.

357
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:42,981
Trouble, Chase?

358
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,328
- I don't know, Sheriff.

359
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:45,788
Take a look.

360
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:46,888
It was just sitting here.

361
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,978
- Probably fell off of a car.

362
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:49,888
- No scratches on it.

363
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,041
- Yeah, maybe it landed in a bush.

364
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,098
- No, as thin as that
imitation leather is,

365
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:58,148
even a bush should take some of it off.

366
00:19:58,148 --> 00:20:00,048
- Was it just like that when you found it?

367
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:01,048
- Yeah, straight up.

368
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,278
- Probably belonged to some hitchhiker,

369
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,558
or it might have belonged to the fella

370
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:08,308
that stole that car and wrecked it.

371
00:20:15,478 --> 00:20:17,215
Say, look at this.

372
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:27,171
A half pack of cigarettes and one unlit.

373
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,138
That suitcase don't
belong to any car thief.

374
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:36,538
He was around here too long.

375
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,108
I'll take it in.

376
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,358
- I'll put it in the car for you.

377
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:42,118
- Somebody will be around to claim it.

378
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,068
See you later, son.

379
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:43,918
- Right, Sheriff.

380
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,721
Hey.

381
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,554
What's with the code bit?

382
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:47,878
I got your phone call.

383
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:49,878
- When I was serving
dinner to Mr. Wheeler,

384
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:51,938
he became very angry.

385
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:53,228
He said if I saw you again,

386
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,038
he would have me sent back to France.

387
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,308
- He can't do that.

388
00:21:56,308 --> 00:21:57,658
- Oh, yes, he can.

389
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,312
He's my sponsor.

390
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:00,481
He put up the bond.

391
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,488
- That has to guarantee

392
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,618
that you wouldn't become
a ward of the state.

393
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:06,348
Now, we don't have to worry about that.

394
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:07,348
You know how to speak English

395
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,388
well enough to get a job anywhere.

396
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:11,968
- He said it's immoral
for me to go out with you.

397
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,038
What's immoral about it?

398
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:13,871
- Nothing.

399
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,708
- I don't want to go away, Chase.

400
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,141
- You won't have to, honey.

401
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:21,868
- They think it's your
fault that Pat ran away.

402
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:24,941
- Well, he can think
whatever he wants to think.

403
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:26,521
He shouldn't take it out on you,

404
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,558
but we hadn't better take any chances.

405
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,388
You go back inside,

406
00:22:32,388 --> 00:22:34,058
and, look, don't worry.

407
00:22:34,058 --> 00:22:35,408
Everything's gonna be okay.

408
00:23:11,028 --> 00:23:12,268
You all right?

409
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:13,341
- All right?

410
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:18,828
Dad, I'm superb.

411
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:21,118
Seven to a box, no corners.

412
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:23,131
I'm around Hal!

413
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:26,298
- Sorry I asked, Mister, uh?

414
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:27,588
- Smith.

415
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:30,988
Horatio Alger Smith.

416
00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:33,078
- Sorry I asked that, too.

417
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,911
How'd you get in the ditch?

418
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,715
You fall asleep?
- Ah, no, no.

419
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:38,698
There was this big pink

420
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,768
and black thing drove
right in front of me.

421
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:42,368
It had stripes this wide.

422
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:43,201
- Sure, sure.

423
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,708
Look, you come up and sit in my truck,

424
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,808
and I'll get your car.

425
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,218
- Okay, that sounds like a good deal.

426
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:50,843
Who knows, maybe we can...

427
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:04,478
- Hey, man, you can't drive this car!

428
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:05,851
Fender's cutting the wheel!

429
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:08,918
- Sure I can the motor works, see?

430
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:10,898
But, thanks for everything, Dad.

431
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:12,681
You're a cotton-picking prince.

432
00:24:15,818 --> 00:24:17,388
- Okay, just a second.

433
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:18,588
I'll get out of the way.

434
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:28,828
What is it?

435
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:30,681
- Move over, Dad, I wanna pass!

436
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:41,858
- What is it now?

437
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,998
- I think you'd better give me a tow, Dad.

438
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,814
The steering wheel won't work.

439
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:48,011
Okay, you take a nap.

440
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:58,746
Good afternoon, Mr. Smith.

441
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,158
- Like, man, guys have had their heads

442
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:04,468
chopped off for less than that.

443
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:05,301
- For what?

444
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:09,358
- For feeling so doggone
good when I feel so bad.

445
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:11,168
How'd I get here, anyway?

446
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,168
- I towed you in this morning, remember?

447
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:17,318
- As a matter of fact, I
remember very, very little.

448
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:18,868
- You said somebody
ran you into the ditch,

449
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,468
but I didn't see any other cars.

450
00:26:22,078 --> 00:26:24,688
- How'd you ever get
me in that bed, anyway?

451
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:25,521
- I carried you in there,

452
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,218
and I sat on you till you fell asleep.

453
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,468
- That must've been quite a chore.

454
00:26:30,468 --> 00:26:33,218
- You wouldn't have gotten
very far in your condition.

455
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,438
- Look, I really appreciate it, um?

456
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:36,358
- Chase Winstead.

457
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:37,191
- Chase.

458
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:40,418
My golly, how much I owe you?

459
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:41,828
- Well, I bent the fender
out from the wheel.

460
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:45,138
You want me to fill it in
and touch it up for you?

461
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:46,248
- No, I don't think so.

462
00:26:46,248 --> 00:26:49,111
I'll get that done when
I get back to the city.

463
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:51,898
- Here have some coffee.

464
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:52,731
- Oh, great.

465
00:26:54,318 --> 00:26:55,418
- How about two bucks?

466
00:26:57,818 --> 00:27:00,388
- Man, this coffee's worth
two bucks all by itself.

467
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:01,768
How about the tow?

468
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,208
- No, I was coming this way anyway.

469
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,601
I missed out on a little study time.

470
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:07,718
Make it three bucks?

471
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:10,128
- Dad, you go to school?

472
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,978
- Sort of, I take a correspondence
course in engineering.

473
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:15,911
- Well, look, I really
feel indebted to you,

474
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:18,698
and I'd like to do
something to pay you back.

475
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:20,718
No next time you're into
town, there's my card.

476
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:21,551
Look me up, will you?

477
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:22,538
- All right, will do.

478
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:23,371
- Okay.

479
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,481
And by the way,

480
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:31,158
buy yourself a sponge rubber hammer, man.

481
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,078
- All right, I will.

482
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:33,235
- I'll see you, Chase.

483
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:35,128
- Thank you.

484
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:41,448
Steamroller Smith?

485
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:42,848
The disk jockey.

486
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:43,681
Mr. Smith!

487
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:51,761
Two 20s!

488
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,201
How about that.

489
00:28:07,238 --> 00:28:08,071
Sheriff?

490
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:09,208
- Howdy, son.

491
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,108
Have you heard anything from Pat and Liz?

492
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,778
- No, nothing.

493
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,688
- Chase, I'm in a jam,

494
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:15,738
and I need your help.

495
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,048
Wheeler swings a big enough stick

496
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,788
in this country to make it rough,

497
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:21,518
and he's doing it.

498
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:23,891
Oh, I can understand
his concern about Pat,

499
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,458
but I just don't have a big enough force

500
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,048
to comb this area inch-by-inch.

501
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:30,458
- Is he demanding that?

502
00:28:31,597 --> 00:28:32,868
There was a man killed in a wreck

503
00:28:32,868 --> 00:28:35,308
in a small canyon in a big city last year,

504
00:28:35,308 --> 00:28:38,388
and it took them 19 days to find him.

505
00:28:38,388 --> 00:28:40,148
I don't know what they expect of me.

506
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:41,348
- Yeah, I remember that.

507
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:45,218
Look Sheriff, maybe I
can get tomorrow off,

508
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,378
and I'll get the gang,

509
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:48,808
and we can go out and search that pass.

510
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:50,358
At least you can put that in your report.

511
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:52,468
- I was hoping you'd say that.

512
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:54,968
I can start at the upper
end and work towards you.

513
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:57,918
Can I have your help in another matter?

514
00:28:57,918 --> 00:28:59,608
- Sure. What?

515
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,668
- You remember how those
skid marks just went at

516
00:29:01,668 --> 00:29:03,898
right angles to the direction
the car was traveling?

517
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:05,348
- That's right, they did.

518
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:06,958
- Headquarters think I'm nuts.

519
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,398
- Well then, they're nuts.

520
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,118
Didn't you send them that picture?

521
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:14,548
- Well, I'm not the world's
greatest photographer.

522
00:29:14,548 --> 00:29:16,148
Pictures didn't come out.

523
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,948
Can't see the skid marks on the black top.

524
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:20,968
- Well, that's what happened.

525
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:24,048
I even wiped up the rubber
dust with my fingers.

526
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:26,448
- You might have to sign a
statement to that effect for me.

527
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,868
- You've got it.

528
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,118
Look, you can even see the
bald spots on the tires

529
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:31,718
where they went sideways...

530
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:34,171
- Yeah, that's the spot all right.

531
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:38,088
But there's another thing that puzzles me.

532
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:38,921
- Yeah, what?

533
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:44,751
- How those tires got off of
that car and almost on yours.

534
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:48,248
- Well, look on this wreck, they'd rot,

535
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:50,968
and my rod they could prevent a blowout.

536
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:52,191
Maybe even an accident.

537
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:58,478
- Well, take good care of them
in case the owner shows up.

538
00:29:58,478 --> 00:29:59,408
- Right.

539
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:00,608
- See you tomorrow.

540
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:01,491
- Right.

541
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:20,751
- Let's call it a day.

542
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:23,208
We've covered half the
roads in this county.

543
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,041
- Yeah.

544
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:26,328
How about that ravine?

545
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:29,058
That runs along here
for about eight miles.

546
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:29,891
We'll start from here,

547
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,621
and you come from the other end.

548
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,861
- Well, all right.

549
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:34,942
- Right.

550
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:35,001
Sure is beat down around here.

551
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,606
Look at that!

552
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,918
- What is it, Chase?

553
00:31:39,918 --> 00:31:41,408
- Looks like an animal of some sort

554
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,088
drug something along here.

555
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:45,258
- You mean a wild animal here?

556
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:47,658
- Sure, could be anything,
even a mountain lion.

557
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,200
Come on.

558
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:30,518
Thirsty?

559
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:33,235
- Yes, but haven't we
gone far enough, Chase?

560
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,011
- Phew that's bitter.

561
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:41,148
Must have an awful lot of mineral in it.

562
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:42,658
- Come on, let's go.

563
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:44,008
- Wait a minute.

564
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:45,478
Let's take a breather first.

565
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:48,323
- Chase, I don't like this place.

566
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:49,540
Let's go back.

567
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,811
- Are you afraid?

568
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:54,002
Now you come on over here
with me and sit in the shade,

569
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,752
and I'll you a story.

570
00:33:12,185 --> 00:33:13,709
That's Gordy maybe
they've found something!

571
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,405
Come on, let's go!

572
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:27,628
- It's Pat's car at
the bottom of the wash,

573
00:33:27,628 --> 00:33:30,638
two or three miles back
by the old reservoir.

574
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:31,948
- Were they in it?

575
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,141
- No, nothing.

576
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,588
- Drive me back to my car,

577
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:38,088
and I'll bring up the wrecker.

578
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:01,338
- I wonder what that was.

579
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,821
- Oh, probably just a little rock slide.

580
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,528
- For some reason this
place gives me the creeps.

581
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:08,485
It always has.

582
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,271
- Lisa.

583
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:17,808
Turn the motor on.

584
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,778
The wench is already engaged.

585
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:22,149
Now, if I yell, turn the key off.

586
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:23,316
Okay.

587
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:34,988
- Okay?

588
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:36,294
Go ahead.

589
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:45,089
Go ahead.

590
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:46,589
Give it some more.

591
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:48,946
Okay, keep going.

592
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,563
Keep going.

593
00:34:59,146 --> 00:34:59,979
Attagirl.

594
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:02,111
Keep it going.

595
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,755
Keep it going you're doing fine.

596
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:14,925
Attagirl.

597
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:16,925
Attagirl, keep it going.

598
00:35:18,565 --> 00:35:19,815
You doing fine.

599
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,251
You did fine, honey.

600
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,458
- It's a little beat up,
but it'll tow all right.

601
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:37,528
- Yeah, we'll meet you
back at the garage, okay?

602
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:38,428
- Let's go, Jenny.

603
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:21,604
- See you later.

604
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,778
Where did you find it?

605
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,008
- By the reservoir in Williams Wash.

606
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:37,841
They weren't in it.

607
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:40,278
There's no sign of blood or anything.

608
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:42,318
You know, I think they were thrown clear.

609
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:43,658
- Did you search the area?

610
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:45,948
- Yeah, Gordy went down the
ravine for about a mile,

611
00:36:45,948 --> 00:36:47,808
and, well, we looked beyond the wreck

612
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:49,248
for a couple hundred yards.

613
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,658
Wouldn't you say, Gordy?

614
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:51,978
- At least that far.

615
00:36:51,978 --> 00:36:53,198
- Did you see any footprints?

616
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:54,031
- No, none.

617
00:36:57,328 --> 00:36:58,318
- This thing's bent around

618
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:00,648
just about the same as that sedan,

619
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:02,948
like it'd been hit with
a 10-ton rubber mount.

620
00:37:03,808 --> 00:37:05,498
- It's a pretty rough
trip down that cliff.

621
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:06,888
That could have done it.

622
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:09,831
- Yeah, I'll have to go
over that area with a rake.

623
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,728
- You know, I've been thinking.

624
00:37:13,728 --> 00:37:16,548
If Liz and Pat had eloped,

625
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:17,828
they wouldn't have take his car

626
00:37:17,828 --> 00:37:20,548
because Old Man Wheeler would
have it traced right off.

627
00:37:20,548 --> 00:37:22,158
- Well, maybe he stole it, Chase,

628
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,868
and then it was stolen.

629
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,938
- Yeah, if it was stolen and
somebody parked it there,

630
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:27,928
well, the brakes could have faded,

631
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:30,089
and it rolled off the edge.

632
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,238
- It'd be a strange coincidence

633
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:34,301
if they came back to
this part of the county.

634
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:36,758
The possibility makes some sense, though.

635
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,908
I'll get my gear and
dust for fingerprints.

636
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:42,598
Gosh, I wish you boys had have called me

637
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:44,298
before you drug it out.

638
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:47,148
I might have found some
clues to help us out.

639
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:48,198
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.

640
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:52,608
- The hard part's telling Mr. Wheeler.

641
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:53,631
I sure dread that.

642
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:56,651
- It's not like we found them there.

643
00:37:58,078 --> 00:37:59,428
- He's sure gonna raise Ned

644
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:01,378
because I don't find this wreck sooner.

645
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:05,178
Where's Mr. Compton?

646
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:06,988
- He went down to the field
with a load of fuel oil.

647
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,738
He'll be back in two or three hours.

648
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,208
I'm gonna close up.

649
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:12,187
- I'll see you later.

650
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,588
- Sorry I'm late.
- Now, Chase Winstead.

651
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,258
Just a minute jot so fast there.

652
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,091
- What for?

653
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:52,288
Did you ever play football?

654
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,194
- With the Green Bay Packers.

655
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:55,092
- Hike!

656
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,278
- Oh, Chase, put me down.

657
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:59,098
- No, not till you tell
me what's going on.

658
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:01,618
- All right, if you close your eyes.

659
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,388
- All right, I don't
know what's happening,

660
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,338
but they're closed.

661
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:10,348
- Keep them closed.

662
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,181
- They're closed.

663
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:14,351
This is silly.

664
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:19,083
- Now, open them.

665
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:22,028
- Look what Lisa got me.

666
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,498
Stay there, Chase.

667
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:24,331
Watch.

668
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,178
Stay there, Chase.

669
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:40,188
I can get up.

670
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:41,021
Stay there.

671
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:01,898
That was wonderful, baby.

672
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,458
Just wonderful.

673
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,968
- But I've been practicing all afternoon,

674
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,268
ever since Lisa brought the braces over,

675
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:11,231
and I walked all the way, twice.

676
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:14,738
I wanted to do it right for you.

677
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,521
- Would you like to hear a song?

678
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,438
- Laughing's important, isn't it, Chase?

679
00:42:24,691 --> 00:42:26,228
- It sure is,

680
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:28,278
and, you know, I never
felt any more like laughing

681
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,678
than I do right now.

682
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:32,148
I didn't think you'd be able
to do that good in a week.

683
00:42:32,148 --> 00:42:33,848
- Didn't you really?

684
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:34,681
- Honest.

685
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:37,228
But, you know, you're gonna
have to work real hard,

686
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:38,408
and you mustn't be disappointed

687
00:42:38,408 --> 00:42:40,341
if it takes a long time, okay?

688
00:42:42,618 --> 00:42:44,943
- That's enough for one day, Missy.

689
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,918
It's your bedtime.

690
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:48,778
- Do I have to, Chase?

691
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:50,281
- You sure do.

692
00:42:52,098 --> 00:42:53,348
Show me how you can walk.

693
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:58,870
- Goodnight, Lisa.

694
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:10,998
- That was a wonderful
thing for you to do, Lisa.

695
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:11,831
- I wanted to.

696
00:43:13,098 --> 00:43:14,551
- Now you're broke, aren't you?

697
00:43:16,336 --> 00:43:17,921
I was gonna pick them up in the morning.

698
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:18,754
- I know.

699
00:43:18,754 --> 00:43:19,788
When you showed me that money

700
00:43:19,788 --> 00:43:22,148
I was afraid you'd get there first.

701
00:43:22,148 --> 00:43:23,558
- Well, I'm still gonna pay you for them.

702
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:25,055
- No.
- Yes.

703
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,888
- No.

704
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:28,501
Yes.

705
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:32,588
Hello?

706
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:33,421
Yeah, Sheriff.

707
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:36,851
Well, he should have
been back an hour ago.

708
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:38,678
No.

709
00:43:38,678 --> 00:43:40,068
Where?

710
00:43:40,068 --> 00:43:40,901
That's awful.

711
00:43:42,148 --> 00:43:43,731
No, it couldn't be Mr. Compton.

712
00:43:44,798 --> 00:43:45,631
All right.

713
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:47,531
At the garage?

714
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:49,448
All right, I'm leaving now.

715
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:50,528
- What is it, Chase?

716
00:43:50,528 --> 00:43:52,078
- It's a wreck, and oil truck.

717
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:53,638
It could be Mr. Compton.

718
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:54,728
Honey, I'm awfully sorry,

719
00:43:54,728 --> 00:43:55,828
but I've got to leave.

720
00:44:01,062 --> 00:44:03,479
- Here he comes now, Sheriff.

721
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:08,751
- Come on.

722
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,218
- Wait a minute, Sheriff.

723
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:12,208
You've got a sore foot.

724
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,041
- Oh, no.

725
00:44:18,068 --> 00:44:19,018
- We can take my Model A.

726
00:44:19,018 --> 00:44:20,122
She's all shiny and bright brand new.

727
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:21,198
- No, we'll take my car.

728
00:44:21,198 --> 00:44:22,618
- Come on, Harris.
- Did you see it?

729
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,321
- No, I didn't see it,
but I sure heard about it.

730
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,008
- Can I open this thing up?

731
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:28,998
- Yeah, go ahead.

732
00:45:13,524 --> 00:45:15,161
That's Compton's rig!

733
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:18,658
Be careful, it's pretty hot.

734
00:45:18,658 --> 00:45:20,168
- He's not in it.

735
00:45:20,168 --> 00:45:22,008
- He may have been hurt and crawled away.

736
00:45:22,008 --> 00:45:23,288
Let's look around.

737
00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:24,248
Come on, Harris!

738
00:45:24,248 --> 00:45:25,271
- Okay.

739
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,471
- Compton!

740
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:27,471
Mr. Compton!

741
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:31,431
- Find anything, Sheriff?

742
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:32,808
- Well, let's go over this again.

743
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:34,778
How did you get into the act?

744
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:36,108
- I told you once.

745
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,018
- Well, tell me again.

746
00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,435
- Well, I was barrelling
along in my Model A.

747
00:45:40,435 --> 00:45:42,038
She don't look like much now,

748
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:43,468
but she was a beauty when I first—

749
00:45:43,468 --> 00:45:44,518
- The accident.

750
00:45:44,518 --> 00:45:45,351
- Still go though.

751
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,978
Get up to 60.
- The accident.

752
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,251
Just the accident.

753
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:50,768
- Well, I'll tell you.

754
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:52,528
- I wish you would.

755
00:45:52,528 --> 00:45:54,488
- This feller seen the headlights

756
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:55,855
coming up the grade towards him,

757
00:45:55,855 --> 00:45:59,148
and all of a sudden they come
at you going over and over,

758
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:00,575
and then blewy.

759
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:02,428
Blewy, she blew up!

760
00:46:02,428 --> 00:46:04,938
Well, he seen somebody
is in a might of trouble,

761
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:07,018
so he come in the store talking about it.

762
00:46:07,018 --> 00:46:09,398
That's when I offered to call you.

763
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:11,888
- Did you get the name of the witness?

764
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:12,788
- No.

765
00:46:12,788 --> 00:46:14,138
- Did he see anything else?

766
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:16,348
- Nope.

767
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:17,918
- Do you wanna wait in the car for us?

768
00:46:17,918 --> 00:46:19,488
- No.

769
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:20,785
- Well, you're going to anyway.

770
00:46:20,785 --> 00:46:21,718
- Okay, Sheriff.

771
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:22,551
Okay.

772
00:46:22,551 --> 00:46:25,035
Like you say, always obey the law.

773
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,445
Do this, do that.

774
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:28,748
Somebody tells you no...

775
00:46:28,748 --> 00:46:30,481
- Any luck, Chase?

776
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:32,298
- No, nothing.

777
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:33,558
- Pat and Liz might have eloped,

778
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:35,711
but Compton ought to be around here.

779
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,088
- Maybe he's in the hospital.

780
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:41,041
- No, I checked there
before I left my place.

781
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:45,698
Would Compton have any
reason to want to get lost?

782
00:46:45,698 --> 00:46:47,651
- No, none that I can think of.

783
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,668
- You would have no
reason to know about this,

784
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:53,271
but there's been a lot of
livestock missing lately.

785
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:57,408
One here, one there.

786
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:58,888
That doesn't make headlines,

787
00:46:58,888 --> 00:46:59,888
but now it's people.

788
00:47:00,745 --> 00:47:02,588
- Do you think there's a tie-up?

789
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:03,808
- I don't know.

790
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:05,598
What we need is a criminal investigator,

791
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:07,698
and headquarters won't send one down here.

792
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:09,983
- Well, maybe they will now.

793
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:12,098
- Yeah, maybe.

794
00:47:12,098 --> 00:47:13,588
Did you notice those skid marks?

795
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:14,568
Just like the others,

796
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:16,088
straight across the road.

797
00:47:17,623 --> 00:47:19,098
If it'd been hit by another vehicle,

798
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:21,341
the paint would be knocked off.

799
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,281
What batters a car
around like it was a toy?

800
00:47:29,608 --> 00:47:31,338
- How's the barn coming
along for the party?

801
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:34,468
- All right, I'll be done
in about an hour or so.

802
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:37,338
Say, you and Chase sure got off light.

803
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:38,718
He took off this morning.

804
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:40,568
You've just sitting around
here on your can all day long.

805
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:43,228
That barn was a place to clean.

806
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,368
- You get the hi-fi set up?

807
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:45,468
- Yeah.

808
00:47:45,468 --> 00:47:47,328
Well, you
steamboats and dreamboats.

809
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:48,670
That's
Steamroller Smith.

810
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,503
He's the most.

811
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,859
Steamroller here at KILT.

812
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:54,928
Now if any of you round rocks
get lonesome for my voice,

813
00:47:54,928 --> 00:47:56,678
I'll be MC'ing a platter party tonight

814
00:47:56,678 --> 00:47:59,418
out at Hargitay's Barn on Route 43.

815
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,478
Drop in, I'll flatten you.

816
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:03,311
- Hey, man, that's us.

817
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,458
We got the steamroller coming out.

818
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,308
- That's where Chase has been all day.

819
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:08,518
Getting steamroller!

820
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,938
- This will be a blast.

821
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:11,287
- How about that guy?

822
00:48:24,788 --> 00:48:27,308
Say little man, you sure had a busy day.

823
00:48:27,308 --> 00:48:30,141
- Getting that paint job
and Steamroller Smith.

824
00:48:31,598 --> 00:48:34,298
- Now how'd you guys find
out about Steamroller Smith?

825
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,798
- Well, he just said so on his program.

826
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:37,678
Said it right out on the network.

827
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:39,948
- Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.

828
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,898
Well come on, don't spread around, huh?

829
00:48:43,118 --> 00:48:44,758
How are the preparations coming?

830
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:46,798
- Oh, that'll be finished
about 45 minutes.

831
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,588
The gang won't start arriving
from east until 9:30.

832
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:51,278
- We're under the wire with time to spare.

833
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:52,111
- No sweat.

834
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,193
It's good.

835
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:43,148
Come on, Tessie Belle.

836
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:44,121
Let's go.

837
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:42,118
- That's the same story
a man down here told me.

838
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,858
Something real strange must
have happened down there.

839
00:51:47,058 --> 00:51:47,948
Oh, yeah, yeah.

840
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:49,448
He'll be here if you want him.

841
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:51,371
Right.

842
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:55,385
Sit down, Harris.

843
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,508
- You be going down to the wreck, Sheriff?

844
00:52:03,508 --> 00:52:05,928
- No, that's not in my territory.

845
00:52:05,928 --> 00:52:07,918
Headquarters already have a report.

846
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:09,718
The troopers will take care of that.

847
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:13,548
Harris, tell me again
about the train wreck.

848
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:17,388
- Well, I was driving around
quiet like in my Model A.

849
00:52:17,388 --> 00:52:18,758
Bought it in '32 for—

850
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:19,928
- Just a minute.

851
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,228
Just a minute.

852
00:52:21,228 --> 00:52:22,528
I ask you what time it is,

853
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:24,378
and you tell me how to build a clock.

854
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:26,928
Just the facts about the wreck.

855
00:52:26,928 --> 00:52:27,761
- Well,

856
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:33,798
I was driving along quiet like.

857
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:34,651
- The wreck.

858
00:52:36,538 --> 00:52:39,478
- Then I turned around
and come back down here

859
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:40,741
and told you about it.

860
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,200
- Give me your keys, Harris.

861
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:45,752
- Keys?

862
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:46,585
My keys.

863
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:49,928
What for?

864
00:52:49,928 --> 00:52:52,728
- For spinning a yarn like
that and driving while drunk.

865
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:57,218
- I demand a soberty test.

866
00:52:57,218 --> 00:52:58,051
- That does it.

867
00:52:58,051 --> 00:52:59,818
Go lock yourself up.

868
00:52:59,818 --> 00:53:02,065
- I demand a soberty test,

869
00:53:02,065 --> 00:53:04,161
because I ain't been drinking.

870
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,331
Well, a least not as heavy.

871
00:53:14,768 --> 00:53:16,118
Whatever you think's right.

872
00:53:17,218 --> 00:53:18,264
Which way is the cell?

873
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:19,097
Which way?

874
00:53:20,925 --> 00:53:23,341
Well, you can't win them
all, can you, Sheriff?

875
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:26,331
- Call your wife if you want to, Harris.

876
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:29,793
- What?

877
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,251
Are you crazy, Sheriff?

878
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:02,164
- Chase.

879
00:54:03,488 --> 00:54:05,548
- Hey, you gonna leave home?

880
00:54:05,548 --> 00:54:07,498
- I'm going to spend the
night with the Blackwells.

881
00:54:07,498 --> 00:54:09,128
Mommy said it was all right.

882
00:54:09,128 --> 00:54:10,948
Will you take me over?

883
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,368
- Well, I don't know, Missy.

884
00:54:12,368 --> 00:54:14,781
Gosh, that's two or
three miles outta my way.

885
00:54:18,028 --> 00:54:19,778
Aw, sure, we will.

886
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:21,089
- Chase.

887
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:24,230
What in the world have you
done to that car of yours?

888
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,848
- It's a new fuel mixture you like it?

889
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,788
- I just barely touched the gas pedal,

890
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:29,058
and the back wheel started to spin.

891
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:30,908
Why, I was two blocks down the road

892
00:54:30,908 --> 00:54:32,248
before I even knew I'd left home.

893
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:33,768
- Come on, Mom, I'm just trying to make

894
00:54:33,768 --> 00:54:35,191
a hot rodder out of you.

895
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:37,501
I'll get it.

896
00:54:40,268 --> 00:54:41,368
Hello?

897
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:42,418
Yeah, hello, Sheriff.

898
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:44,281
A what?

899
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:47,638
Book on reptiles?

900
00:54:47,638 --> 00:54:50,191
Yeah, I guess I still have
it around here somewhere.

901
00:54:51,218 --> 00:54:52,321
Yeah, sure.

902
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:55,578
I have to take Missy
over by the Blackwells.

903
00:54:55,578 --> 00:54:58,331
I'll stop by on my way
to pick up Lisa, okay?

904
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,318
- Well, now I'm gonna tell
you something you don't know.

905
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:06,021
I've been talking to a zoologist,

906
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:10,258
and the Gila monster size is controlled,

907
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:11,208
like everything else,

908
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:14,688
by a sort of thyroid or pituitary gland.

909
00:55:14,688 --> 00:55:16,348
Sometimes a change in diet can throw

910
00:55:16,348 --> 00:55:18,378
the balance all outta whack.

911
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:22,878
Either the cells breakdown
too fast or build up too slow,

912
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:27,108
and this subset makes either
runts or giants out of them.

913
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:28,588
- Good, but what's that mean to me?

914
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:29,941
- Well, I'm coming to that.

915
00:55:31,138 --> 00:55:34,638
The zoologist also told me about a doctor

916
00:55:34,638 --> 00:55:35,678
that just found the bones

917
00:55:35,678 --> 00:55:37,958
of some huge animals down in Tanganyika,

918
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:43,348
and the theory was that they
lived in river delta country,

919
00:55:43,348 --> 00:55:45,628
and certain salts that
had washed into the valley

920
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:47,188
had been absorbed by the plants

921
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:49,778
and then transferred to the animals.

922
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:51,151
causing them to be giants.

923
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:54,728
- Hmm.

924
00:55:54,728 --> 00:55:55,758
All right.

925
00:55:55,758 --> 00:55:57,318
- Yeah, I know.

926
00:55:57,318 --> 00:55:59,178
I probably sound a little bit like Harris,

927
00:55:59,178 --> 00:56:01,961
but let me tell the whole
thing in my own words.

928
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:05,908
There was another report out
of Russia or the Ukraine.

929
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:07,988
It was in the paper a couple months ago,

930
00:56:07,988 --> 00:56:09,728
maybe you saw it,

931
00:56:09,728 --> 00:56:12,108
about a baby that weighed 130 pounds

932
00:56:12,108 --> 00:56:15,660
when it was 10 months old and
was taller than its mother?

933
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,398
Grew up to be a giant.

934
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:21,201
- Yeah, and that same thing
could happen right here.

935
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:25,478
Did you see any footprints
around any of those wrecks?

936
00:56:26,388 --> 00:56:27,221
- No.

937
00:56:28,578 --> 00:56:30,018
Gila monster footprints?

938
00:56:30,018 --> 00:56:31,088
- Yeah, a big one,

939
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:33,378
about the size of a bus.

940
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:34,388
- Oh, come on.

941
00:56:34,388 --> 00:56:35,638
Are you serious?

942
00:56:35,638 --> 00:56:37,821
- Well, I don't know.

943
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:40,141
But Harris saw it,

944
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:42,598
and some of the survivors
of the train wreck saw it.

945
00:56:42,598 --> 00:56:43,848
A giant lizard.

946
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:45,348
- Train wreck where?

947
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:47,438
At the bridge
over Wilson's Wash.

948
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:48,458
- When?

949
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,808
- Tonight, about an hour ago.

950
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:52,688
The troopers were inclined to pass it off

951
00:56:52,688 --> 00:56:55,348
as shock or optical illusion.

952
00:56:55,348 --> 00:56:57,448
You can't always believe what Harris says.

953
00:56:59,488 --> 00:57:02,751
- A Gila monster, pink and black stripes.

954
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:06,838
You know, I towed a guy in the other day

955
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:08,298
and he said he'd been forced off the road

956
00:57:08,298 --> 00:57:10,108
by something like that.

957
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:12,451
I didn't believe him,
because he'd been drinking,

958
00:57:13,338 --> 00:57:17,298
and another thing when we
were looking for Pat's car,

959
00:57:17,298 --> 00:57:20,021
we saw where something had
been drug down the wash.

960
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:23,788
You know, if they could
have gotten that big,

961
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:26,688
they could have knocked Mr.
Compton's truck off that road.

962
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:29,818
They could've gotten him.

963
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:36,528
- I shouldn't have told you about this

964
00:57:36,528 --> 00:57:37,878
until after the party.

965
00:57:37,878 --> 00:57:39,778
But I just thought you'd want to know.

966
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,168
- Hadn't we better warn everybody?

967
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:43,508
- No.

968
00:57:43,508 --> 00:57:46,258
It operates in and around the Wash.

969
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:49,008
Troopers have got that staked
off for a couple of miles.

970
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:50,398
Just keep it to yourself.

971
00:57:50,398 --> 00:57:51,701
It might cause panic.

972
00:57:52,558 --> 00:57:54,258
- Okay, Sheriff, whatever you say.

973
00:57:55,798 --> 00:57:57,118
- Try and forgot it for now,

974
00:57:57,118 --> 00:57:59,538
and have some fun, will you, boy?

975
00:57:59,538 --> 00:58:00,371
- Yeah.

976
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:25,768
All right, hold it!

977
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,462
Hold it, all you jumping beans!

978
00:58:29,058 --> 00:58:30,878
Now, I've got a surprise for you.

979
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:32,550
We got the king of the DJs.

980
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:37,138
Now, you've all heard him
on his platter show on KILT.

981
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:38,982
That's right!

982
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:39,857
Steamroller Smith!

983
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,394
- Hi.

984
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:50,218
Okay, your Old Dad here
has some small words

985
00:58:50,218 --> 00:58:51,698
and some great records.

986
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,028
I want you to have a ball tonight.

987
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:56,248
Let's begin with one of
the top KILT survey songs.

988
00:58:56,248 --> 00:58:57,698
What do you say now let's everybody dance.

989
00:58:57,698 --> 00:58:59,278
Here we go.

990
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:00,738
Let's go, everybody.

991
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,513
- Yeah.

992
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:26,831
Now do you mind telling
me what this is all about?

993
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:28,678
- Have you been down to the train wreck?

994
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:29,618
- No.

995
00:59:29,618 --> 00:59:30,621
- Well, I have.

996
00:59:31,518 --> 00:59:34,041
I talked to a trooper about my son's car.

997
00:59:34,928 --> 00:59:36,488
He said it shouldn't have been moved

998
00:59:36,488 --> 00:59:38,878
until a thorough
investigation had been made,

999
00:59:38,878 --> 00:59:40,328
and it had been photographed.

1000
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,011
This wasn't done, was it, Sheriff?

1001
00:59:45,268 --> 00:59:46,561
I thought not.

1002
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:50,811
It was removed and clues
lost without authority.

1003
00:59:51,748 --> 00:59:54,141
You didn't put that in your
report, did you, Sheriff?

1004
00:59:55,178 --> 00:59:56,205
Of course you didn't,

1005
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:57,641
and I'll tell you why.

1006
00:59:58,548 --> 01:00:00,981
You were protecting that Chase Winstead,

1007
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:04,498
covering him regardless of the effect

1008
01:00:04,498 --> 01:00:05,698
it might have on others.

1009
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:09,028
- Chase was only trying to help.

1010
01:00:09,028 --> 01:00:10,258
He's your son's friend,

1011
01:00:10,258 --> 01:00:12,221
probably the best one he ever had.

1012
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:14,768
Of course, it wasn't in the report.

1013
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:15,881
What good would it do?

1014
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:20,698
Any kid can make a mistake,
Mr. Wheeler, even yours.

1015
01:00:20,698 --> 01:00:24,151
- But Sheriff, it's my son that's missing.

1016
01:00:27,588 --> 01:00:29,141
Let me ask you something else.

1017
01:00:30,448 --> 01:00:32,851
Have you heard the reports
about a giant lizard?

1018
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:35,668
You believe them?

1019
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,428
- I don't know, Mr. Wheeler.

1020
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:40,268
It doesn't seem possible.

1021
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:42,878
- Well, why not, there
have been giants before.

1022
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:44,378
- That's true.

1023
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:47,408
But how could anything that
big go unnoticed in this area?

1024
01:00:47,408 --> 01:00:49,558
- Have you ever walked the
length of William's Wash?

1025
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:51,013
- No.

1026
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:52,238
- Do you know anybody that has?

1027
01:00:52,238 --> 01:00:53,458
- No.

1028
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:56,028
- That area is so choked with underbrush,

1029
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,158
it isn't even good hunting ground,

1030
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:01,148
and I say it is possible
for a giant lizard

1031
01:01:01,148 --> 01:01:03,598
to have lived there for
years without being seen.

1032
01:01:05,388 --> 01:01:06,221
Now,

1033
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:09,541
if that is the case,

1034
01:01:11,278 --> 01:01:12,361
my son's dead.

1035
01:01:14,678 --> 01:01:15,571
So is Compton.

1036
01:01:17,858 --> 01:01:20,058
I can't blame you for
what's happened to Pat,

1037
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:21,941
but Compton's death is on your hands.

1038
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,288
- How did you come to that conclusion?

1039
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:25,848
- I'll tell you how.

1040
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,888
His truck was found only
two miles beyond Pat's car,

1041
01:01:29,888 --> 01:01:31,958
and if you'd have investigated
that area thoroughly

1042
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,658
as you're paid to do,

1043
01:01:33,658 --> 01:01:35,111
Compton might not have died.

1044
01:01:36,228 --> 01:01:37,061
Well?

1045
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:40,453
Now come out here I wanna
show you something else.

1046
01:01:44,381 --> 01:01:46,568
Now something may have hit this car.

1047
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:48,221
But it didn't take the tires off,

1048
01:01:49,098 --> 01:01:51,038
and where did those new white sidewalls

1049
01:01:51,038 --> 01:01:53,488
on Chase Winstead's hot rod come from?

1050
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:54,818
- Here, I guess.

1051
01:01:54,818 --> 01:01:56,038
There was a towing charge against—

1052
01:01:56,038 --> 01:01:58,558
He presumed the bill wouldn't be paid,

1053
01:01:58,558 --> 01:02:01,458
so he borrowed the tires in the meantime?

1054
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,548
- Perhaps.
- That's thievery!

1055
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:06,148
Destroying evidence and
obstructing justice!

1056
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:08,928
Now, your last official act of office

1057
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:11,598
will be to arrest that
boy and bring him in,

1058
01:02:11,598 --> 01:02:14,904
and I'll go along to
make sure that it's done.

1059
01:03:01,138 --> 01:03:04,228
- Hey, kids, a fellow dropped
in over at KILT the other day

1060
01:03:05,218 --> 01:03:06,728
and played me a great new song.

1061
01:03:06,728 --> 01:03:07,818
I thought it was just fine.

1062
01:03:07,818 --> 01:03:08,688
I wanna play it for you.

1063
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:11,198
We got a little pickup group together

1064
01:03:11,198 --> 01:03:12,908
and cut a demo of this guy.

1065
01:03:12,908 --> 01:03:13,741
I wanna play it for you now

1066
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:15,448
and see what you think about it.

1067
01:03:15,448 --> 01:03:16,448
By the way, the first person

1068
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:19,298
who identifies the singer on the record

1069
01:03:19,298 --> 01:03:22,590
gets two free rides on my
elephant in Bangkok, Siam.

1070
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:27,091
But you gotta pay your own
way over there and back.

1071
01:03:28,368 --> 01:03:29,898
Okay, here it is now.

1072
01:03:29,898 --> 01:03:31,208
See what you think of it.

1073
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:09,408
- Don't give up tar and feathers yet.

1074
01:04:09,408 --> 01:04:10,528
I'm gonna play the rest of it.

1075
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:11,588
How do you like it?

1076
01:04:13,138 --> 01:04:14,978
Okay, who's the singer?

1077
01:04:14,978 --> 01:04:15,811
- Elvis.

1078
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:16,898
One of the Everleys.

1079
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,108
- Bill Darnell.

1080
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:19,021
- Kate Smith.

1081
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:21,898
- Very funny, but you lose.

1082
01:04:21,898 --> 01:04:24,698
Look, the same guy you
hear singing on the record

1083
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:25,768
also wrote the song.

1084
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:27,128
Now who is it?

1085
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:28,121
Does anybody know?

1086
01:04:29,154 --> 01:04:30,438
- We don't know who is it?

1087
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:31,928
- Okay, okay.

1088
01:04:31,928 --> 01:04:34,008
It's going to come out on
records in a couple of months,

1089
01:04:34,008 --> 01:04:35,921
and you can find his name on the label.

1090
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:40,402
- I know who it is.

1091
01:04:40,402 --> 01:04:41,235
Who?

1092
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:42,911
- Who is it, Lisa?

1093
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:44,840
Come on tell us.

1094
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,128
Chase did it!

1095
01:04:47,128 --> 01:04:47,998
- You did it, Chase?

1096
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:49,238
- Why didn't you say something?

1097
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:50,548
- You didn't tell us.

1098
01:04:50,548 --> 01:04:51,788
- Well, I didn't know
if there was anything

1099
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,002
I'd want to admit to.

1100
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:56,442
- Come on up here, boy.

1101
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:01,494
All right.

1102
01:05:01,494 --> 01:05:03,594
Okay, hold it, hold it.

1103
01:05:03,594 --> 01:05:04,548
Quiet, everybody.

1104
01:05:04,548 --> 01:05:06,558
Also, up at the station the other day

1105
01:05:06,558 --> 01:05:08,068
Chase played me another little song.

1106
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:09,965
It's kind of different from this one,

1107
01:05:09,965 --> 01:05:11,758
but I imagine with a little coaxing,

1108
01:05:11,758 --> 01:05:13,678
you know, by hitting your
hands together like this,

1109
01:05:13,678 --> 01:05:15,091
he might give you a little preview of it.

1110
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:15,924
What do you say?

1111
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:56,007
Go and help Penny!

1112
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:01,458
What'll it take to stop that thing?

1113
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,178
- I don't know, but I'm
going down to the train wreck

1114
01:08:03,178 --> 01:08:04,208
and get some troopers.

1115
01:08:04,208 --> 01:08:05,738
If we pump enough lead into that thing,

1116
01:08:05,738 --> 01:08:07,732
we may hit a vulnerable spot.

1117
01:08:07,732 --> 01:08:09,538
Wheeler, you're gonna
have to give me a hand.

1118
01:08:09,538 --> 01:08:11,118
- But how?
- Keep these kids here.

1119
01:08:11,118 --> 01:08:13,010
I don't want anybody roaming around.

1120
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:16,658
- Where are we going?

1121
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:18,578
- Storage shed.

1122
01:08:18,578 --> 01:08:20,463
I've got an idea that might work.

1123
01:08:26,328 --> 01:08:27,318
- You been after this.

1124
01:08:27,318 --> 01:08:28,498
Now you've got it.

1125
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:29,698
You're deputized.

1126
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:30,618
Listen, kids.

1127
01:08:30,618 --> 01:08:31,498
Wheeler's my deputy?

1128
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:33,228
You'll take your orders from him.

1129
01:08:33,228 --> 01:08:35,128
Arrest anybody that tries to get away.

1130
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:40,698
- Sheriff says this is the place to stay.

1131
01:08:40,698 --> 01:08:42,138
But we're not staying here.

1132
01:08:42,138 --> 01:08:42,971
- That's right.

1133
01:08:42,971 --> 01:08:44,834
- I'll have to arrest anyone that leaves.

1134
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:06,538
- Now you take these keys

1135
01:09:06,538 --> 01:09:08,688
and wait inside the
office till I get back.

1136
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:22,228
I told you to wait inside.

1137
01:09:22,228 --> 01:09:23,738
Why don't you do what I tell you?

1138
01:09:23,738 --> 01:09:25,208
I haven't got much time.

1139
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:26,768
- You're not going to leave me, Chase.

1140
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:27,778
I'm going to help.

1141
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:29,058
- Do you know what's in here?

1142
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:30,018
Nitroglycerin.

1143
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:31,728
Enough to blow up half this town.

1144
01:09:31,728 --> 01:09:33,238
- It doesn't matter.

1145
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:34,745
I'm still going to help.

1146
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:35,578
- Holy.

1147
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:38,248
All right, now take these, hold them,

1148
01:09:38,248 --> 01:09:40,138
and don't let them bump,

1149
01:09:40,138 --> 01:09:42,468
and for heaven sakes don't drop them.

1150
01:09:54,185 --> 01:09:55,373
Now hold those.

1151
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:30,758
Boy, he went through here, all right.

1152
01:10:30,758 --> 01:10:33,517
Now, they generally
travel in a straight line.

1153
01:10:34,558 --> 01:10:37,068
Good Lord, he's hit the Blackwell home!

1154
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:38,241
That's where Missy is!

1155
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,402
Mrs. Blackwell?

1156
01:10:44,648 --> 01:10:45,481
Missy?

1157
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:47,772
Missy?

1158
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,208
Mrs. Blackwell!

1159
01:10:58,928 --> 01:10:59,761
Missy!

1160
01:11:01,635 --> 01:11:04,551
Hang on to that nitro
we're cutting across!

1161
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:24,618
Keep that stuff still.

1162
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:25,918
Do you want to blow us up?

1163
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,481
There they are.

1164
01:11:28,481 --> 01:11:29,693
Where is Missy?

1165
01:11:29,693 --> 01:11:30,526
- Missy!

1166
01:11:33,618 --> 01:11:34,668
It's all right, Missy!

1167
01:11:34,668 --> 01:11:35,808
It's all right!

1168
01:11:35,808 --> 01:11:37,478
Lisa, get Missy and hold her down,

1169
01:11:37,478 --> 01:11:38,911
and both of you lie flat!

1170
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:38,507
Are you all right?

1171
01:12:38,507 --> 01:12:40,065
- I was scared, Chase.

1172
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,297
- That's okay, honey.

1173
01:12:42,297 --> 01:12:43,758
- I tore my new dress.

1174
01:12:43,758 --> 01:12:45,848
- Oh, we can get you a new dress.

1175
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:47,091
- A hundred dresses.

1176
01:12:50,618 --> 01:12:51,718
- Everybody all right?

1177
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:53,931
- Yeah.

1178
01:12:57,558 --> 01:12:59,388
- On the way back we picked up his trail,

1179
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:01,451
followed him across country.

1180
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,448
What did you hit him with?

1181
01:13:08,678 --> 01:13:12,238
- My brand new, 100% completed hot rod.

1182
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:13,778
- You'd have to start the next county

1183
01:13:13,778 --> 01:13:16,078
to get up enough momentum
to do that to him.

1184
01:13:16,078 --> 01:13:19,008
- Not with four quarts of
nitroglycerin riding with you.

1185
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:21,848
- You rode across that
rough field carrying nitro?

1186
01:13:21,848 --> 01:13:23,084
- Yes, sir!

1187
01:13:23,084 --> 01:13:25,358
- Do you know what could
have happened to you?

1188
01:13:25,358 --> 01:13:26,488
- It did.

1189
01:13:26,488 --> 01:13:28,008
I lost my car.

1190
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:29,468
- Oh, don't worry about that.

1191
01:13:29,468 --> 01:13:31,855
Railroad will be glad
to buy you a new one.

1192
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:38,448
- Did you see me run,
Chase, did you see it?

1193
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:39,708
- I sure did, Missy.

1194
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,058
You were really travelling.

1195
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:49,048
- I thought I told you to keep
those kids up at the barn?

1196
01:13:49,048 --> 01:13:51,298
- Well, how do you arrest a bunch of kids

1197
01:13:51,298 --> 01:13:52,588
going in all different directions?

1198
01:13:52,588 --> 01:13:54,398
- Do you realize what would have happened

1199
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:55,898
if that thing had turned back?

1200
01:13:56,896 --> 01:13:58,596
- Same thing that happened to Pat.

1201
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:03,441
Sheriff, your job is a much
bigger one than I thought.

1202
01:14:06,182 --> 01:14:08,018
Since Compton's gone,

1203
01:14:08,018 --> 01:14:09,531
I guess Chase is out of a job.

1204
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:11,371
- That's right.

1205
01:14:11,371 --> 01:14:13,468
- Would you make it a point
to have the boy come around

1206
01:14:13,468 --> 01:14:14,868
and see me in the morning?

1207
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,595
- I'll bring him around in the morning.
