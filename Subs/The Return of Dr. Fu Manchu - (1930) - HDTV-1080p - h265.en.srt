1
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,073
Hello Albert.

2
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,905
What's going on here?

3
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:23,363
Chinese wedding?

4
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:24,971
No, funeral.

5
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,488
Is somebody dead?

6
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,072
I hope so.

7
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,221
They're gonna bury him.

8
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,137
Ooh, who?

9
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,804
Dr. Fu Manchu.

10
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,238
Haven't you ever read about him?

11
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,863
Do you feel equal to going in?

12
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:55,863
No, no Inspector Smith.

13
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:57,596
It's still so horrible to me.

14
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:00,447
I'll take Lia for a little drive

15
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,030
and we'll pick you up later.

16
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:03,346
All right Dr. Betreace.

17
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:09,197
Oh, I say, Inspector.

18
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:10,697
Oh, hello Camden.

19
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,572
Are you covering this for your paper?

20
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:15,322
Yes, there are several
details I wish to clear out.

21
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:16,863
Well, I'll be glad to help you

22
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,488
if you'll come inside and wait for me

23
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:20,488
while I officially attend the service.

24
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:21,721
Thanks very much.

25
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,887
- Let's sit down here.
- Oh, thanks.

26
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,238
Can you tell me how many men
Fu Manchu actually murdered?

27
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:10,155
I'm afraid we'll never know,

28
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,804
he was too clever in his methods.

29
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:15,197
Look here, Camden, can't
you persuade your paper

30
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,947
to soften that part of the story?

31
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:21,822
Before Fu Manchu went insane,
he was a magnificent scientist

32
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:22,823
working for mankind.

33
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:26,155
And not only that,
during the boxer rioting

34
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,530
he was the best friend the
White man had in China.

35
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:32,030
And when the Chinese rebel
attacked the British delegation

36
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:35,447
Eltham, one of the missionaries
sent his little girl

37
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,762
to Fu for safety.

38
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:39,822
But some of the Chinese snipers

39
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,197
used Fu's garden wall for protection.

40
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:45,863
The White troops were obliged to fire

41
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:50,780
and Fu Manchu's wife and
little son whom he adored

42
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,905
were killed before his eyes.

43
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,280
Is that why he went insane?

44
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:55,137
Yes.

45
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:57,280
And in the mistaken belief
that his White friends

46
00:04:57,304 --> 00:04:59,822
had intentionally fired on his house,

47
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,447
he swore to his gods
that he'd wiped them out

48
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,488
to the third generation.

49
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,697
And that he would use the child,

50
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:08,988
Lia Eltham in his vengeance.

51
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:11,947
The next 20 years, Fu spent murdering

52
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,554
the surviving officers
of the boxer rioting

53
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,554
in Russia, Germany and France.

54
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:28,780
And just before death, Fu
sent to each of his victims

55
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:30,221
this blood-stained dragon.

56
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,304
The stain represents his wife's blood.

57
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:38,530
For every officer he murdered,

58
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:41,863
He re gilded a scale that
had been covered with blood.

59
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:43,322
Ah, there's one left.

60
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:46,387
Yes, he meant to kill
young Petrie for that scale.

61
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,197
He brought the girl Lia into the plot,

62
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,947
all entirely innocently upon her father

63
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,721
and used her to lure the boy.

64
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,280
And one time he actually
had them both prisoners

65
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,198
in Limehouse.

66
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:02,613
Ah, that was when you made
your famous capture, wasn't it?

67
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:05,405
I'm afraid death made the capture.

68
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:09,113
He took some Oriental poison he concocted

69
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,137
just as we got him.

70
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,947
A delightful chap.

71
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,387
Inspector, why are you here today?

72
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,863
To see the coffin sealed

73
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:24,613
and also to pay my respects
to a truly great man.

74
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,863
Just one more thing, Inspector.

75
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,929
What's happened to young
Petrie and the girl?

76
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,363
They've been through a horrible ordeal,

77
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:41,221
but they're young and very much in love.

78
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,197
As a matter of fact,

79
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,846
I've got my eye on a wedding present.

80
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,030
As nice a funeral as I could wish for.

81
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,054
Yes Master.

82
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:35,012
Do not look so serious,
stupid one.

83
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:40,054
This wax on my face makes
it difficult to laugh.

84
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:48,238
And now Chang, we have work to do.

85
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:52,179
We must not tolerate
interference from anyone.

86
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:07,280
Gods of my ancestors, help me to keep

87
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,762
my solemn promise to you.

88
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,613
Only one life more.

89
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,447
Let the blood of Jack Petrie

90
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:20,304
wipe this stain from the house of Fu.

91
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:30,512
Do you hear that?

92
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,637
The organist is practicing
the wedding march

93
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
in the chapel.

94
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,572
Wasn't it nice of Aunt
Agatha and Aunt Helen

95
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:39,197
to have the wedding here?

96
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:40,031
Yes.

97
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:43,471
You know my great grandfather
was married in that chapel.

98
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:47,221
In a few more hours we'll be married.

99
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,072
Nancy was telling
me, the Lohengrin March

100
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:52,863
always comes first.

101
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,655
Slowly and solemnly up
to the altar like that.

102
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,738
And then.

103
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,863
Back down the isle in
triumph in the spirit of,

104
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,238
I've got my man.

105
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,572
Agatha.

106
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,262
Oh, there you are.

107
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:15,762
Hello.

108
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,072
I don't know how we'll
ever be able to thank you

109
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:23,072
and Aunt Helen for all
you're doing for us.

110
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:26,572
My dear, you've already
paid us a thousandfold.

111
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:28,197
Indeed you have.

112
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:32,322
Don't you realize the thrill
two maiden ladies feel

113
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:34,655
having a wedding in their own house.

114
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,155
Speak for yourself, my dear.

115
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:38,322
I get no thrill at all out of sentiment.

116
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,238
Oh, don't put on your
Amazon mood Agatha.

117
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:49,637
- Look where you're going.
- I can't.

118
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,697
Oh, get along, get it.

119
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,721
Get along.

120
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,762
The old spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.

121
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,072
What's the matter with you, Sylvester?

122
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,988
You're quaking like a jelly.

123
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,655
I can't help you, lady Agatha.

124
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,113
Ever since Fu Manchu came into my life,

125
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:12,113
I've been nothing but a nervous wreck.

126
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:15,488
I've imbibed eight strong
cups of tea since breakfast,

127
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:16,822
but nothing seems to help.

128
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,363
Well, there's nothing
to be nervous about now.

129
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,262
Fu Manchu is dead, isn't he?

130
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:22,304
So they tell me.

131
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:27,262
Whoa, my soul and body.

132
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,572
Wait, don't do it, I beg of you.

133
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:34,405
What's the matter now?

134
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,822
There's nothing in the world
so sure to bring bad luck

135
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:41,280
as the groom kissing the
bride before the wedding.

136
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:42,697
Rubbish.

137
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,197
If they didn't kiss before the wedding,

138
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:45,679
there'd never be any wedding.

139
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:49,155
Now run along you to
uncover the marriage service

140
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,197
in the prayer book.

141
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:52,387
You don't know a word
of it, either of you.

142
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,512
I'll take care of him.

143
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:58,054
Oh, please don't.

144
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:00,846
Leave them alone.

145
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:19,221
To love and to cherish
until death us do part.

146
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:28,887
We're going to be so happy.

147
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:34,262
What was that?

148
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,471
That was only an aeroplane shadow.

149
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:45,387
Lia?

150
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:52,947
I feel just the way I used
to when Dr. Fu was alive

151
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,363
and near.

152
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:55,387
Oh no.

153
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,596
Is everything prepared
as I have ordered?

154
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:25,096
Is the camouflage
arranged for our airplane?

155
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,780
I did as you ordered, Master.

156
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:30,905
And the wedding of Dr. Petrie,

157
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:34,197
it takes place today.

158
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:37,030
Yes, today, honorable one.

159
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:38,387
Good.

160
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:42,363
Although they have not seen
fit to send me an invitation,

161
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:46,072
I shall be nevertheless an interested,

162
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:49,304
though invisible, guest.

163
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:53,614
Wow, you are lovely.

164
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:55,947
Come and have a look at
yourself in the large mirror.

165
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,738
Just lovely.

166
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:01,155
That gown is beautiful and
you're going to be so happy,

167
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,114
I know.

168
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:04,363
Oh, I love weddings, dear.

169
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,072
Oh, I love those pearls.

170
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,137
Pins, where are my pins?

171
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:12,738
Fai Lu, I'm going to
throw the wedding bouquet

172
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:14,863
straight at you, see that you catch it.

173
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,887
I'll catch.

174
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,447
Look how dark it's getting.

175
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,322
There must be a storm coming.

176
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:29,762
Yes, I think we should have some light.

177
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:46,846
There's so much to remember
and exactly as much to forget.

178
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,197
Ring, right hand, left hand, pass over.

179
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,655
Ring, right hand, left hand, pass over.

180
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,113
Ring, right hand, left hand, pass over.

181
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:57,697
Ring, right hand, left hand, pass over.

182
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:03,780
Stop, I dread you stop.

183
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,238
Stop what?

184
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:08,947
That whistling, it's bad luck.

185
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:09,971
All right.

186
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,637
Don't!

187
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,947
It's worse luck to sing than to whistle.

188
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,863
So tell me, Sylvester,

189
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,447
is it bad like to strangle your best man?

190
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,697
I don't think so.

191
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,822
No, excellent.

192
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,429
Let go, leave me alone.

193
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:34,137
I'm so nervous now.

194
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:42,030
Oh, you're going to take that long trip

195
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,822
just to give me away.

196
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:45,947
You are a darling to ask me.

197
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:48,655
You know, I feel as
though you belong to me.

198
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,488
Come along, come along,
the music's already started

199
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:52,822
in the chapel.

200
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:55,738
We'll take care of her
or take care of her tree.

201
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:57,405
Here's flowers Ms. Lia.

202
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:59,280
Oh, thank you Fai Lu.

203
00:15:59,304 --> 00:16:00,863
Oh, I'm so happy.

204
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:05,887
Ms. Lia happy leave old Fai Lu?

205
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,822
No, you old darling.

206
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:09,363
You're going to live with us always.

207
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:10,447
Oh, come along, come along.

208
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,822
Don't be so sentimental.

209
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,804
A wedding's no place for
sentiment, come along, come along.

210
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,304
Oh girls, do be careful with that train.

211
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,947
Lia my dear, what's the matter?

212
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,030
I don't know.

213
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,596
I feel just as I used to when...

214
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:39,238
It's the wedding excitement.

215
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:40,971
No wonder the child's upset.

216
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:45,804
Don't worry, I'm all right now.

217
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,637
Now everybody, be calm, be calm.

218
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:58,363
Don't get excited.

219
00:16:58,387 --> 00:17:00,304
Watch me, see how calm I am.

220
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:04,197
They're ready.

221
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,405
Now, be perfectly calm.

222
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:06,364
Be perfectly calm, Doctor.

223
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:07,947
Remember, I'll be there with you.

224
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:11,280
Now, quick, we go in by the side door.

225
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:14,863
Ready, ring, right hand,
left hand, pass over.

226
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,780
Pass over, pass over, pass over.

227
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,655
Ring, right hand.

228
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:28,197
We are gathered together
here in the sight of God

229
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:30,179
and in the face of this congregation

230
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:34,137
to join together this man and this woman

231
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:40,012
in holy matrimony, which
is an honorable estate in-

232
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,762
Ms. Lia, Ms. Lia.

233
00:18:49,721 --> 00:18:50,573
Doctor.

234
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,846
Ms. Lia, Fu Manchu alive.

235
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,304
Fu Manchu alive.

236
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,655
Oh, I knew it.

237
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,363
I felt him near me.

238
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:06,738
She's dead.

239
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:23,679
Now please don't cry anymore, dear.

240
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,238
Did you find anything, Smith?

241
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,262
Not a thing.

242
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:34,137
Some agent of Fu Manchu
is responsible for this.

243
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:37,429
I think it is Fu Manchu himself.

244
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,447
But I saw Fu Manchu dead.

245
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,113
I pronounced him dead.

246
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:45,221
Yes, and I saw him sealed in his coffin.

247
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,447
But I'm convinced now that he lives.

248
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:53,905
Wasn't there an autopsy
performed on the body?

249
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:56,863
No, out of respect for his religion.

250
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:57,887
Stupid.

251
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,863
I deserve any criticism
you might care to make,

252
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:03,113
lady Agatha.

253
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,613
Nonsense.

254
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,322
It was on my pronouncement
that you pass the body.

255
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,863
Good of you to share the blame, Petrie.

256
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,887
But I'm afraid it's not gonna help much.

257
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,262
But how can he still be alive?

258
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:36,179
The poison he took was
obviously not poison.

259
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:39,471
The funeral was conducted
entirely by Orientals.

260
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:43,012
I don't doubt the embalming was fake.

261
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:47,238
Anything is possible with a
man is rich and diabolical

262
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:48,988
as Fu Manchu.

263
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,554
But still I'm not
convinced that he's alive.

264
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:56,988
I'm sure of it, I felt it.

265
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,863
Why should that being
take it out on poor

266
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:00,988
inoffensive Fai Lu?

267
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,554
You've forgotten that
she once betrayed him.

268
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,405
When he had Petrie a
prisoner in Limehouse,

269
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:09,988
it was Fai Lu who saved Jack's life.

270
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:10,823
And mine.

271
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:14,488
So you see Fai Lu's deaths
served a double purpose.

272
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:15,697
What do you mean?

273
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:18,054
Revenge and warning.

274
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,887
I found this message in Fai Lu's hand.

275
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,197
It's addressed to you, Petrie.

276
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,655
Shall I read it?

277
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:27,679
Please.

278
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:33,346
"Esteemed Dr. Petrie, let
this be the first warning

279
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,554
that your life is still forfeit
to the gods of my ancestors.

280
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:41,655
Best you still have faith
that your misguided friends

281
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,863
can shield you, or the
brilliant Inspector Smith

282
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,697
protect you, I shall send a second warning

283
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,596
through my faithful Lia.

284
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,322
May you die 1000 mental deaths

285
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:58,822
in anticipation of the
third and last warning,

286
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:00,721
which I shall deliver to you myself.

287
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:05,971
There is still one bloodstain
scale to be wiped out.

288
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:10,554
The dragon has begun to coil about you.

289
00:22:12,304 --> 00:22:13,387
Fu Manchu."

290
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:16,905
Smith, we must do something.

291
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:18,488
We must do something at once.

292
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:21,721
We'll get nowhere,
Petrie, by losing our heads.

293
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:24,971
Sorry.

294
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,905
Inspector Smith, the men have
arrived from Scotland Yard.

295
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:31,113
Good.

296
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:34,155
Oh, Lady Helen, do
you mind them coming in?

297
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:35,363
Certainly not, Inspector.

298
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,322
Show them in.

299
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:37,346
Yes, my lady.

300
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:48,197
Come in please.

301
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:49,863
- Good evening.
- Good evening sir.

302
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,262
- Good evening.
- Evening.

303
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,488
- Good evening sir.
- Evening.

304
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:58,822
You all know from my message
that Fu Manchu is alive.

305
00:22:58,846 --> 00:22:59,988
Yes sir.

306
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,322
My men realize the
seriousness of that statement

307
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,072
only too well.

308
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:05,447
And I must ask all of you

309
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,572
to follow my orders to the letter.

310
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:09,304
We will do as you say, Inspector.

311
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,012
First thing is to plan our defense.

312
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:13,739
Morely.

313
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:14,947
Sir.

314
00:23:14,971 --> 00:23:15,971
- Kendall.
- Sir.

315
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,137
You two men, guard the north gate.

316
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:19,971
Very good sir.

317
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,238
- Abbot.
- Sir.

318
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:22,113
The bridge over the mountain.

319
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:22,948
Very good, sir.

320
00:23:22,972 --> 00:23:24,697
- Prescott.
- Yes, sir.

321
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:25,947
You stay on guard in the barn.

322
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:26,863
Yes, sir.

323
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:27,864
- Gordon.
- Sir.

324
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:29,697
Tell the Constable to
you use the stable man

325
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:31,488
as a patrol around the outer wall.

326
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:32,323
Very good, sir.

327
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:33,822
Post all men in the shadows.

328
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:34,656
Yes, sir.

329
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,363
You two men, stay in the house with me.

330
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:37,572
Yes, sir.

331
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:40,655
My first request is that you retire

332
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:42,096
to your rooms immediately.

333
00:23:44,304 --> 00:23:45,114
Harding.

334
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:46,363
Yes sir.

335
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:48,447
You stay with Dr. Petrie here.

336
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,137
Don't leave him for a moment.

337
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,031
- Lawrence.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,679
You are to guard Ms. Lia.

339
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:59,637
And now please remember, Fu
Manchu was in this house tonight

340
00:24:01,637 --> 00:24:05,988
and his traps may be laid in
the most unsuspected places.

341
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:08,655
Keep away from all windows.

342
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,822
I don't wish to alarm you unduly

343
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:14,387
but Fu Manchu may still be in this house.

344
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:21,655
If I see anything, I'll die.

345
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,096
I know I'll die.

346
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:30,887
And if I don't see anything,
I'll be scared to death.

347
00:24:34,346 --> 00:24:36,054
I'm not afraid for myself.

348
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:37,887
It's for you.

349
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,679
Come Lia.

350
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:03,637
Sylvester, what are you afraid of?

351
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:06,804
I'm afraid of nothing.

352
00:25:07,762 --> 00:25:08,762
Nothing?

353
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:13,262
Nothing, but I shall sit up all night.

354
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,697
Petrie.

355
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:16,822
Yes, Inspector.

356
00:25:16,846 --> 00:25:19,179
I wanna go over the
plans of the house again.

357
00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:30,887
Sylvester dear, that
was only Phyllis barking.

358
00:25:32,637 --> 00:25:35,762
Just think I may be dead tomorrow.

359
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,780
And if I'm not here, there
won't be anybody left

360
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,846
to be sorry for me.

361
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:08,387
And that's not all,
this miserable Fu Manchu.

362
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:09,221
Yes, my lady.

363
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:12,155
I tell you if we women
were running Scotland Yard,

364
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,363
he'd never had been allowed to
behave in this feverish way.

365
00:26:15,387 --> 00:26:16,387
Yes, my lady.

366
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,697
Do you know what it was?

367
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:40,721
Listen.

368
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:50,030
Don't be frightened, it's
probably some men in the wood.

369
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:54,197
No, it's not that,
it's the call of Siva.

370
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,988
The call of Siva?

371
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:58,280
Yes, I heard it in the Orient.

372
00:26:58,304 --> 00:27:00,238
Dr. Fu told me it was a signal

373
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:03,238
used by a tribe of native thugs.

374
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,113
Smith, it's locked.

375
00:27:35,137 --> 00:27:36,429
Put your shoulder to it.

376
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:41,155
- Lia, Aunt Agatha!
- Where's the light switch?

377
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,179
Over here.

378
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,096
You look in here, Petrie?

379
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:51,846
Petrie.

380
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:58,262
Look out!

381
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:10,346
Don't touch that.

382
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:14,179
It's a dot from a blow
gun and maybe poisoned.

383
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,054
The second note from Fu.

384
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:29,113
"Esteemed Dr. Petrie, be
at the standing stones

385
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,780
on the moor at midnight quite alone.

386
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:35,405
Obviously this is a trap, yet
with Lia as the precious bait,

387
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,072
you will instantly walk into it.

388
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:41,030
To an Oriental, a woman
would not be worth the risk,

389
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:43,530
but being a White man,
you will not be able

390
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:46,238
to bear the thought of
her suffering torture.

391
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:49,155
Your sentimentality will bring you.

392
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:52,846
With sympathy, Fu Manchu."

393
00:28:54,054 --> 00:28:54,864
Where are you going?

394
00:28:54,888 --> 00:28:56,405
To the standing stones, of course.

395
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:58,655
Listen doctor, I
realize you are a Petrie

396
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,387
and descended from a
long line of brave men.

397
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:04,405
But don't let your courage
outrun your common sense.

398
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,113
Smith, I have more respect
for you than any man alive.

399
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,738
But the thought of Lia in Fu's
clutches is driving me mad.

400
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:11,697
I've got to do something.

401
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:12,531
Wait a minute.

402
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:13,947
I can't wait, it's already 11 o'clock

403
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:14,864
and he's torturing her.

404
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:16,863
He said so in that note.

405
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,655
Don't you think your
death would torture her?

406
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,405
Don't try and reason with me, Smith.

407
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:23,572
There's only one thing I can understand.

408
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,613
Fu Manchu has got Lia.

409
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:27,655
I know it and because of that,

410
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,679
we may get Fu Manchu and
save Lia and Lady Agatha.

411
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,596
But you've got to follow my orders.

412
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:37,471
What's your plan?

413
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:39,554
Tonight at midnight.

414
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:49,363
We've got the place surrounded, sir.

415
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,113
That's the closest we can
get without being observed.

416
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:53,363
Very good.

417
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:55,947
Remember to keep your men
hidden until the attack.

418
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:57,804
Fu Manchu said that
Petrie must come alone.

419
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:58,780
Very good sir.

420
00:29:58,804 --> 00:29:59,637
How about lights?

421
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,280
We've got 40 motor cars.

422
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:03,322
When I fire two shots, they have orders

423
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:04,156
to turn their headlights on

424
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,322
and flood the whole place with the lights.

425
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,762
Then we close in.

426
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:10,387
Here he comes now.

427
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:19,698
Everything ready, Smith?

428
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,447
Everything's ready.

429
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,262
Better use your car, Petrie.

430
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:25,947
They're expecting you at 12 sharp.

431
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:28,405
It's now 11:40.

432
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:29,988
Every man to his post, hurry.

433
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,429
Very good, sir.

434
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:21,031
Call for planes.

435
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:22,137
Hurry, hurry.

436
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:36,221
Master, the gates are shut.

437
00:31:42,096 --> 00:31:45,262
Put this in the black onyx bottle.

438
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:53,971
Are you certain that no one
suspects us in this place?

439
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,679
Quite certain, honorable one.

440
00:31:57,804 --> 00:31:58,804
It is well.

441
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:03,738
This old dye-works is
excellent for our purposes

442
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:07,613
and you have prepared it very cleverly

443
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:09,887
in accordance with my orders.

444
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:16,405
My good nature shall reward you.

445
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:24,572
Where is he, that miserable Fu Manchu?

446
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:26,988
I demand that I see him, and at once!

447
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,322
Since she has come to herself,

448
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:31,780
it is impossible to keep her quiet.

449
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:33,387
Permit to come in.

450
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,596
Your hands.

451
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:13,822
You have something to
tell me, Lady Agatha?

452
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,988
I have a great deal to tell you.

453
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:18,887
What do you mean by
carrying on in this fashion?

454
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:21,072
Frightening women half out of their wits

455
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,387
and making a game of murder.

456
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:24,822
What do you mean?

457
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:25,863
Where's Lia?

458
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:28,822
Not having your superb constitution,

459
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:29,947
she has not yet to recovered.

460
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:33,054
You dare so much to lay
a hand on that girl, I,

461
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,363
I demand that you release us at once.

462
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:39,363
I can well understand
you're being terrified

463
00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:44,012
to find yourself in my hands, helpless.

464
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:46,488
But being an English woman,

465
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,155
you are too proud to show your fear.

466
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:52,113
If you know what's good for you, Dr. Fu,

467
00:33:52,137 --> 00:33:55,155
you will give up this
melodramatic nonsense

468
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:56,804
and get back to China.

469
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:06,387
You will pardon me.

470
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:13,137
I quite agree with you.

471
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,905
I shall look forward to
continuing our discussion

472
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,738
some other time.

473
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:22,637
Just now I have a matter
of some greater importance.

474
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:27,030
Escort her ladyship to her cell

475
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:29,221
and see that she has every comfort.

476
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:52,887
Lia, Lia.

477
00:34:59,804 --> 00:35:01,512
Little Lotus blossom.

478
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,054
You are awake.

479
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:05,971
Oh, it is you.

480
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:09,822
I regret that it was necessary

481
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,137
to interrupt your wedding, my dear.

482
00:35:13,054 --> 00:35:17,655
But perhaps it is fortunate
the ceremony was not completed.

483
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,471
It is better to be a sorrowing sweetheart

484
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,947
then an inconsolable widow.

485
00:35:23,971 --> 00:35:27,322
Oh, if it's my life, you want, take it,

486
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:30,697
but please, please don't harm Jack.

487
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:33,780
Your life means nothing to me,

488
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:38,530
but the life of your sweetheart
I have pledged to my gods.

489
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,887
Your Dr. Petrie shall die just as my wife

490
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:46,822
and little son died at the
hands of those White devils,

491
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,096
your countrymen.

492
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:51,137
Well, you've failed.

493
00:35:52,054 --> 00:35:55,238
You won't get him, I tell
you, you won't get him.

494
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:56,988
They'll put a guard around him.

495
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:57,823
They'll protect them from-

496
00:35:57,847 --> 00:36:01,363
- That is you where
you're wrong, my child.

497
00:36:01,387 --> 00:36:04,822
He will gladly deliver himself to me.

498
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:09,072
- What do you mean?
- If he were threatened

499
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:12,762
with torture, would you not come to him?

500
00:36:18,054 --> 00:36:20,471
I see that you understand me.

501
00:36:27,137 --> 00:36:30,030
Master, the aeroplane has come.

502
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:30,864
Good.

503
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:31,971
They have brought him.

504
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:38,155
I was right in my prophecy.

505
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:41,012
Your sweetheart is in my hands.

506
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,179
Jack, Jack.

507
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,804
You are a welcome messenger, Arling.

508
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:16,863
You shall be rewarded.

509
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:19,113
Thanks, great one.

510
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:23,429
Remove the bandage that
I may feast upon my hate.

511
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:31,488
Good evening, Doctor.

512
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:33,137
Fool, imbecile.

513
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:36,137
You have brought the wrong man.

514
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:40,596
Hold this miserable one for my call.

515
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:43,948
I didn't know.

516
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:48,971
You shall still be
rewarded, my hateful servant.

517
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:08,863
I am sorry, Inspector,
but the servant problem

518
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:10,655
is a difficult one.

519
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,113
I'd ask mercy for that poor devil

520
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:16,280
if I thought you knew
the meaning of the word.

521
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:21,262
It always gives me pleasure
to prove you wrong, Inspector.

522
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:24,012
I shall not have him killed.

523
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,221
Thank you.

524
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,096
Sit down.

525
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:45,346
So, we too meet again.

526
00:38:46,346 --> 00:38:48,137
It was inevitable, Doctor.

527
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:50,822
Since the reports of your death

528
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:53,012
were so greatly exaggerated.

529
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:58,738
Did my resurrection puzzle you?

530
00:38:58,762 --> 00:38:59,804
Exceedingly.

531
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:04,096
You see, I attended your funeral.

532
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:07,304
I was deeply touched.

533
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:13,179
I promise you that I will
return the compliment.

534
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,471
Thank you.

535
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:22,221
You will be amused at my death trick.

536
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:29,512
The poison I drank was,
as you see, not fatal.

537
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,488
A discovery of your own, Doctor?

538
00:39:31,512 --> 00:39:36,197
Yes, at least the present ingredients.

539
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:37,846
The theory is old.

540
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:42,596
Your Shakespeare used it
in "Romeo and Juliet.”

541
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:49,697
I have used it several times on my enemies

542
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,012
with perfect success.

543
00:39:53,846 --> 00:39:57,488
As you will readily see, the beauty of it

544
00:39:57,512 --> 00:40:01,387
is that apparently they die.

545
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:05,655
Then they awake after three days

546
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:10,679
to find themselves in
a coffin, buried alive.

547
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:17,762
Then they really die.

548
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:23,804
The thought of inflicting
two deaths on a victim

549
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:29,363
delights my peculiar sense of humor.

550
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,512
Yes, it would.

551
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:38,721
In my own case, I have you to thank

552
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:44,262
for observing the religious
customs of my race.

553
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,512
If an autopsy had been performed,

554
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:51,738
I would have become my own victim.

555
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:56,238
That would have been delighted
my sense of humor, Doctor.

556
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:04,637
A cigarette?

557
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:09,596
No, thank you.

558
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,863
I prefer one of my own cigars,

559
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:17,947
but in searching me, your
men took my cigar case.

560
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:20,238
I shall have it brought at once.

561
00:41:22,846 --> 00:41:25,304
Mr. Smith's cigar case.

562
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:32,804
I'm afraid for once, your
plans have miscarried.

563
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:38,137
If I'm not mistaken, you
took Dr. Petrie's place,

564
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,863
believing you could better
handle any situation

565
00:41:41,887 --> 00:41:43,780
that might arise.

566
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:48,655
And of course, you arranged that your men

567
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:52,155
would follow and rescue you.

568
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,179
Precisely.

569
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,262
But the one thing I didn't
foresee and prepare for

570
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:59,346
was an aeroplane.

571
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,780
Did it not occur to you that
even if your men did follow,

572
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:09,596
they might be a trifle
late and find you dead?

573
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:20,679
The thought did occur
to me, Doctor, I admit.

574
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:24,697
But if it ended in your capture,

575
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:27,447
I considered it quite worthwhile.

576
00:42:30,012 --> 00:42:32,780
You see, I could
scarcely ask anyone else

577
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:34,012
to take the risk.

578
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,887
I honor you for your
spirit of sacrifice.

579
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:48,346
But it would be impossible
for your men to find you here.

580
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,804
The goddess of fortune
has put you into my hands

581
00:42:56,887 --> 00:43:00,846
and you shall not slip through them.

582
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,137
Smith, you have been a powerful opponent.

583
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:12,113
And without flattery, I
admit that your removal

584
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:15,096
will be a great relief to me.

585
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:21,197
It's unusual for a death
sentence to be so complimentary.

586
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:23,221
I am not going to kill you.

587
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:27,197
That's a pleasant surprise.

588
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,096
Your mind is my enemy.

589
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:35,179
I shall merely kill your mind.

590
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,012
What do you mean?

591
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,721
The black onyx bottle.

592
00:43:53,846 --> 00:43:56,887
And have Arling brought in.

593
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,304
I will show you.

594
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:14,137
I have promised the honorable
inspector to spare your life.

595
00:44:15,846 --> 00:44:17,488
How can I thank you?

596
00:44:17,512 --> 00:44:22,072
But wait, I must still punish the brain

597
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:23,887
that failed me tonight.

598
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,387
The potion paralyzes
the brain immediately.

599
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:54,221
And very soon, he will
be completely demented.

600
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:12,846
And that, Inspector, is what
I am going to do to you.

601
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:23,637
The strain is killing me.

602
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:27,530
I think it my relieve my
mind if I had a good cry,

603
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:28,364
don't you?

604
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:30,096
- Perhaps.
- Yes.

605
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:49,054
There there, Sylvester.

606
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:55,179
Jack, any news?

607
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:57,179
No.

608
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,804
The draft is ready.

609
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:12,072
But don't think me too inhuman, my friend.

610
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:17,096
I never prepared a poison
without compounding an antidote,

611
00:46:17,804 --> 00:46:22,738
the ingredients of which
are known only to myself.

612
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:27,762
I shall restore your mind
after my work is completed.

613
00:46:28,762 --> 00:46:31,863
Of course, if I should happen to be killed

614
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:34,012
by your blundering assistants,

615
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:37,655
I should hate to think of your future.

616
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,363
Horrible, but quite worthwhile

617
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:43,780
if I could be sure of your death.

618
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,762
Flattery, Inspector, flattery.

619
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:52,863
Is there any last request before we begin

620
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:54,304
our little experiment?

621
00:46:56,387 --> 00:46:59,072
Perhaps you should like
to write some record

622
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,572
for your memoirs.

623
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:06,762
No, but I haven't eaten
since before the wedding.

624
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:14,221
It takes time to eat.

625
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,988
And during that time, you
think you might work out

626
00:47:19,012 --> 00:47:23,387
a solution to save yourself from this.

627
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:29,846
I advise
you not to put it off.

628
00:47:39,846 --> 00:47:41,762
You still are hungry?

629
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:48,697
Very well, I do not wish
to appear poor host.

630
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:50,887
So I shall dine with you myself.

631
00:47:53,012 --> 00:47:56,804
And this shall be served as your liquor.

632
00:47:59,387 --> 00:48:01,096
You will pardon me a moment.

633
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:05,072
I must give my personal attention

634
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:07,596
to the ordering of so important a meal.

635
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:14,197
I might add, escape is impossible.

636
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:16,304
Every exit is guarded.

637
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:29,280
Are you all right?

638
00:48:29,304 --> 00:48:30,238
Yes.

639
00:48:30,262 --> 00:48:31,239
Where's Jack?

640
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:32,405
Quite safe at home.

641
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,322
- An airplane.
- Searching for us.

642
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,863
Will we escape?

643
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,721
Not yet, they're watching for my signal.

644
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:48,739
What's that?

645
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:52,262
My cigar case, but also
a gun for signal lights.

646
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:05,971
Come.

647
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:09,762
Watch that door.

648
00:49:38,221 --> 00:49:39,238
Do you think they saw it?

649
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:41,113
We can only hope so, my dear.

650
00:49:41,137 --> 00:49:42,137
You better go back.

651
00:49:43,554 --> 00:49:45,738
What's Fu Manchu going to do to you?

652
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:47,863
Nothing if you'll help me.

653
00:49:47,887 --> 00:49:49,054
Now, listen to me, Lia.

654
00:49:52,762 --> 00:49:55,322
I think it is only the air raid,

655
00:49:55,346 --> 00:50:00,346
but if we should be attacked,
use these hand grenades.

656
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:03,947
They are powerful enough to
blow to bits a score of men.

657
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:05,387
The door is unbolted.

658
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:07,596
Watch for my signal.

659
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:29,655
Unfortunately, most of these
dishes were prepared for me

660
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:31,655
and they're Chinese.

661
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,554
I hope your palette will not be outraged.

662
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:37,554
Sit down.

663
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:43,679
This is bird's nest soup.

664
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:51,096
The condemned man ate a hearty dinner.

665
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:55,155
Are you sure the signal came
from the old Wilson dyeworks?

666
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:56,447
Yes, sir, I made certain.

667
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,655
- Good, let's go.
- Right,

668
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,614
you take the upper road.

669
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,096
We'll pick up some more men.

670
00:51:04,054 --> 00:51:07,637
Are you eating slowly to delay your fate

671
00:51:08,554 --> 00:51:11,512
or is it that you do not enjoy your eggs?

672
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,572
They are a bit gamey.

673
00:51:14,596 --> 00:51:18,947
We consider three years
the proper age for eggs.

674
00:51:18,971 --> 00:51:20,137
Only three years?

675
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,530
Perhaps some
condiments would disguise

676
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:26,197
the Oriental flavor.

677
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:29,262
No, really, I prefer the original.

678
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:32,387
50 million Chinese can't be wrong.

679
00:51:34,346 --> 00:51:36,762
A brave man to the last.

680
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:43,387
And this, Inspector, is a shark's fin.

681
00:51:56,012 --> 00:52:00,887
And with this course, we serve our liquor.

682
00:52:08,512 --> 00:52:13,363
Let's drink, Inspector, to your courage.

683
00:52:13,387 --> 00:52:17,238
And also to that brilliant brain of yours,

684
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:22,262
which I regret to add will
presently cease to function.

685
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:26,780
Keep still.

686
00:52:26,804 --> 00:52:30,363
One sound and I'll plunge
this knife in your throat.

687
00:52:30,387 --> 00:52:32,488
Listen to me, Doctor.

688
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:35,387
Give me your word that Lady
Agatha, Lia, and myself

689
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:38,762
are given immediate freedom
or I'll kill you instantly.

690
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:42,679
Don't cry out.

691
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:50,554
Smith, I am disappointed in you.

692
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:54,447
You must know that I would be prepared

693
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,887
for some such emergency.

694
00:52:57,929 --> 00:53:02,280
If I'm found dead, my servants have orders

695
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,530
to put to death not only you,

696
00:53:05,554 --> 00:53:09,429
but Lady Agatha and Lia as well.

697
00:53:10,471 --> 00:53:12,405
I'm not afraid, Mr. Smith,

698
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:13,863
you do what you think is best.

699
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:16,447
Now you have courage, Lia.

700
00:53:16,471 --> 00:53:21,322
But unfortunately the
inspector is a sentimentalist

701
00:53:21,346 --> 00:53:23,447
and Englishmen cannot bear the thought

702
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:25,429
of women being tortured.

703
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:29,304
You may be willing to
suffer death to defeat me,

704
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,221
but not incurable insanity.

705
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:38,887
Unless you give me your
word to release us,

706
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:41,780
one twist of this,

707
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,238
And I'll force this drink down your throat

708
00:53:46,262 --> 00:53:50,346
and destroy the brain, which
alone knows the antidote.

709
00:53:54,804 --> 00:53:57,155
Had I been in your position,

710
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:01,072
my first move would have
been to empty that cup.

711
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:04,030
Nine times out of 10,
you've already done so, but-

712
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:07,613
- Prepare to take the chance then, Doctor.

713
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:09,887
I have no time to argue.

714
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:13,887
You win.

715
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:17,429
You win.

716
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:23,113
I give my word.

717
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:24,530
Your word of honor?

718
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:25,887
My word of honor.

719
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:32,512
I promise to return you
and the two women unharmed

720
00:54:33,846 --> 00:54:36,030
to Greenwood Towers.

721
00:54:36,054 --> 00:54:39,780
But in exchange, I must
be guaranteed safety

722
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:42,697
for myself and my servants.

723
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:44,655
I'll give you a six hours.

724
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:47,137
Five will be quite sufficient.

725
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:48,804
Very well, it's a bargain.

726
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:53,447
I have a tingling curiosity

727
00:54:53,471 --> 00:54:58,072
to know if you have been
threatening me with an empty cup.

728
00:54:58,096 --> 00:54:59,887
Will you satisfy it?

729
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,887
I should have been disappointed otherwise.

730
00:55:15,054 --> 00:55:17,447
They got the guns, take cover.

731
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:21,322
Quick!

732
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:30,280
Hurry up men, hurry up.

733
00:55:30,304 --> 00:55:31,198
Come on boys.

734
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:34,530
Come on, break down that door.

735
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:36,471
It is your men, Inspector.

736
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:39,988
Since their arrival makes
it impossible for you

737
00:55:40,012 --> 00:55:42,572
to keep your part of the bargain,

738
00:55:42,596 --> 00:55:45,262
certainly I am released from mine.

739
00:55:46,304 --> 00:55:47,971
Oh, oh, you beast.

740
00:55:50,762 --> 00:55:52,822
Please get me out.

741
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,387
Chang, kill that man.

742
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:09,988
Hurry.

743
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:11,012
Through that door.

744
00:56:18,804 --> 00:56:19,614
Where's Lia?

745
00:56:19,638 --> 00:56:20,887
Fu's got her out there.

746
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:26,804
I am but
slightly wounded, Inspector.

747
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:29,613
It is not the end of the story,

748
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:32,304
only the end of another chapter.

749
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:38,030
Oh, Smith, I can't
stand this any longer.

750
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:40,322
Why don't you let me get
out and do something?

751
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:41,572
I know what you're going through,

752
00:56:41,596 --> 00:56:44,613
but you can see for yourself
that everything possible

753
00:56:44,637 --> 00:56:45,947
is being done.

754
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:48,863
All the police in the British
Isles are on the lookout.

755
00:56:48,887 --> 00:56:51,113
Every port is being watched.

756
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:53,905
Harding has 50 picked
men scouting the city.

757
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:57,304
And if anyone can find him, Harding can.

758
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:06,531
Yes, sir.

759
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:09,405
Have you got that
Chinaman, Chang to talk yet?

760
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,113
Not yet, sir.

761
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,863
Keep trying.

762
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,887
Right, sir.

763
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,387
Oh, Harding.

764
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:24,679
Oh, that you Harris?

765
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:27,572
What?

766
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,762
You've lost him, where?

767
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:32,137
By the river?

768
00:57:33,137 --> 00:57:34,137
How long ago?

769
00:57:36,346 --> 00:57:38,613
Put every man you've got into finding him.

770
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:39,762
Yes, at once.

771
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:32,637
Repeat after me.

772
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:35,679
Inspector Smith.

773
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:39,572
Inspector Smith.

774
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:40,971
Harding talking.

775
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:43,238
Harding talking.

776
00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:44,280
We've got him.

777
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:45,447
We've got him.

778
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:47,988
I'm coming for you
immediately in the car.

779
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:50,113
I'm coming for your
immediately in the car.

780
00:58:50,137 --> 00:58:51,988
We'll need Dr. Petrie.

781
00:58:52,012 --> 00:58:53,363
We'll need Dr. Petrie.

782
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:58,947
Now speak in an excited tone.

783
00:58:58,971 --> 00:59:01,363
Inspector Smith, Harding talking.

784
00:59:01,387 --> 00:59:04,238
We've got him, I'm coming for
you immediately in the car.

785
00:59:04,262 --> 00:59:05,762
We'll need Dr. Petrie.

786
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:14,488
Harding's on the phone, sir.

787
00:59:14,512 --> 00:59:15,512
Harding?

788
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:18,346
Yes Harding.

789
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,988
Inspector Smith, Harding talking.

790
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:24,363
We've got him, I'm coming for
you immediately in the car.

791
00:59:24,387 --> 00:59:26,447
We'll need Dr. Petrie.

792
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:27,471
What about Lia?

793
00:59:30,012 --> 00:59:31,738
He's so excited, he rang off.

794
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:32,698
What did he say, what's up?

795
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:36,363
Get your hat Petrie, Harding has got Fu.

796
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:37,364
We'll wait for him below.

797
00:59:37,388 --> 00:59:38,655
Yes, I know, but Smith.

798
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,846
Has he got Lia?

799
00:59:47,762 --> 00:59:50,697
- Hello, Harding.
- Inspector Smith.

800
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:51,721
Yes.

801
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:57,947
Harding, we've left Smith behind.

802
00:59:57,971 --> 00:59:59,054
Oh, driver.

803
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,929
Driver.

804
01:00:03,637 --> 01:00:05,596
Harding, what are we doing in this car?

805
01:00:06,471 --> 01:00:07,512
Harding, the dri...

806
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:09,429
Harding.

807
01:00:30,096 --> 01:00:32,988
It will please you to know, Dr. Petrie

808
01:00:33,012 --> 01:00:35,346
that your health is perfect.

809
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:37,637
You recover quickly.

810
01:00:38,637 --> 01:00:39,863
Where's Lia?

811
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:43,280
Lia is here and safe.

812
01:00:43,304 --> 01:00:46,655
Now that you've got me, you let her go.

813
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:49,905
Those details can be discussed later.

814
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:52,738
I have a present and very urgent need

815
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:55,512
for your professional services, Doctor.

816
01:00:56,971 --> 01:00:58,822
What do you mean?

817
01:00:58,846 --> 01:01:03,762
You see your friend's
bullet reached its mark.

818
01:01:04,721 --> 01:01:09,179
It is embedded in here,
near the base of my skull.

819
01:01:10,637 --> 01:01:13,905
Possible paralysis has already set in

820
01:01:13,929 --> 01:01:16,846
because the bullet impinges on a nerve.

821
01:01:18,096 --> 01:01:22,197
Any physician I might call in
would be professionally bound

822
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:24,512
to turn me over to the police.

823
01:01:27,512 --> 01:01:32,304
The price I pay for being
such a sought after celebrity.

824
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,697
Well, what is this to do with me?

825
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:46,721
You, Dr. Petrie, I know to
be one of the most skillful

826
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:49,179
young surgeons in London.

827
01:01:50,137 --> 01:01:55,137
This operation is delicate,
but not necessarily dangerous.

828
01:01:56,262 --> 01:02:00,530
In fact, it can be done
under a local anesthetic.

829
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:05,096
I intend that you shall
operate and remove the bullet.

830
01:02:09,804 --> 01:02:11,971
Very well, I'll operate.

831
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:17,887
I can read the part in
your mind, my young friend.

832
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:23,721
In such a delicate spot,
the knife will slip a little

833
01:02:24,012 --> 01:02:27,679
and your enemy is gone.

834
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:30,221
Is it not so?

835
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:33,596
I'll do the best I can.

836
01:02:35,054 --> 01:02:36,780
I can't do any more than that.

837
01:02:36,804 --> 01:02:40,971
You can and you will do more than that.

838
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:46,988
Tonight you will be the most
skillful surgeon in London

839
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:50,697
and the operation will
be eminently successful

840
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:55,637
or Lia will remain

841
01:02:55,679 --> 01:03:00,096
in her present condition forever.

842
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:03,721
What have you done to Lia?

843
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:11,512
Bring Ms. Lia in.

844
01:03:22,554 --> 01:03:23,554
Lia.

845
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:39,198
Lia.

846
01:03:39,222 --> 01:03:43,721
Do not frighten her, merely observe her.

847
01:03:47,512 --> 01:03:51,012
I have taken her mind, Doctor.

848
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:55,596
And only I can restore it.

849
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:01,887
But you shall have it back
for the successful operation.

850
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:08,179
And now your hand will not slip.

851
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,846
Will it, Dr. Petrie?

852
01:04:13,262 --> 01:04:15,512
Oh Lia, Lia.

853
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:49,096
Are you ready?

854
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:56,447
Yes, but I have no instruments.

855
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:59,488
I think I have all that is required.

856
01:04:59,512 --> 01:05:02,804
I do considerable dissecting myself.

857
01:05:05,262 --> 01:05:06,262
Let us go.

858
01:05:14,596 --> 01:05:18,322
Johnson, bring Chang in this room.

859
01:05:18,346 --> 01:05:19,947
Watch him carefully.

860
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:20,971
Yes, sir.

861
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:23,780
Speaker, come with me.

862
01:05:23,804 --> 01:05:24,804
Very good, sir.

863
01:05:52,387 --> 01:05:54,179
Johnson, I want you a moment.

864
01:05:59,054 --> 01:06:01,280
Is Chang still unwilling
to make a statement?

865
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:02,613
Yes, sir.

866
01:06:02,637 --> 01:06:04,238
Well, watch him carefully.

867
01:06:04,262 --> 01:06:07,613
Under no circumstances must
he be allowed to escape.

868
01:06:07,637 --> 01:06:08,637
Right, sir.

869
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,762
Inspector, Inspector, he has escaped.

870
01:06:17,804 --> 01:06:19,863
It's all right, Johnson, I planned it.

871
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:23,197
He escaped through that window
and is now being followed.

872
01:06:23,221 --> 01:06:25,197
I'm hoping he's dazed
enough from his wounds

873
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:26,596
to lead us to Fu Manchu.

874
01:06:28,554 --> 01:06:33,554
The temptation to kill me
must be very great, Doctor,

875
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:40,447
since you must realize that
our bargain concerning Lia

876
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:44,012
does not alter my promise to my gods.

877
01:06:46,221 --> 01:06:51,221
My first act when I am
recovered, after curing Lia,

878
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:57,554
of course, will be to take your life.

879
01:06:59,012 --> 01:07:04,012
But remembering Lia, you
will control yourself.

880
01:07:08,054 --> 01:07:11,721
I feel perfectly safe in your hands.

881
01:07:17,429 --> 01:07:19,197
We traced Chang to a
warehouse on the river.

882
01:07:19,221 --> 01:07:21,530
I'm positive it's Fu's hiding place.

883
01:07:21,554 --> 01:07:22,489
I'll show you the way, sir.

884
01:07:22,513 --> 01:07:23,947
All right, come with me.

885
01:07:23,971 --> 01:07:25,637
Jackson, you'll follow me.

886
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:27,113
Yes, sir.

887
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,655
I've finished.

888
01:07:39,429 --> 01:07:41,762
You operated just in time.

889
01:07:42,721 --> 01:07:45,471
Put your shoulder into it.

890
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:54,887
Don't shoot.

891
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:03,822
Good evening, doctor.

892
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,596
Good evening, Inspector.

893
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:07,887
Don't hurt him.

894
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:12,280
See how solicitous the
doctor is of his patient.

895
01:08:12,304 --> 01:08:13,113
What do you mean?

896
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:14,031
I've just operated on him,

897
01:08:14,055 --> 01:08:15,488
but nothing must happen to him.

898
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:18,905
If your men will release
me, in the next room,

899
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:22,238
I will show you why the
doctor is so concerned.

900
01:08:22,262 --> 01:08:23,073
It's Lia.

901
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:24,780
Yes, Lia.

902
01:08:24,804 --> 01:08:26,363
Smith do anything that he asks.

903
01:08:26,387 --> 01:08:27,387
Release him.

904
01:08:29,512 --> 01:08:33,012
Your men must stay here quietly.

905
01:08:33,887 --> 01:08:38,113
Excitement might put Lia beyond my power

906
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:40,179
to restore her mind.

907
01:08:51,596 --> 01:08:55,554
Before I cure Lia, I
must ask another favor.

908
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:59,863
This time from Inspector Smith.

909
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,655
What is it?

910
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,721
I must walk out of that
door a free man, Smith,

911
01:09:06,637 --> 01:09:10,655
and I must be allowed to
leave England unharmed.

912
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:12,530
I'll not agree to that.

913
01:09:12,554 --> 01:09:14,405
Well Smith, think of what you're saying.

914
01:09:14,429 --> 01:09:18,155
For Lia's sake, for my sake,
I'd do anything he asks.

915
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:22,405
A nice problem Inspector and the villain

916
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:24,363
holding all the cards.

917
01:09:24,387 --> 01:09:29,387
I can see that
you are wavering already.

918
01:09:30,429 --> 01:09:33,405
You can't refuse your friend's request.

919
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:36,572
You can't leave the poor
gal in this condition.

920
01:09:36,596 --> 01:09:39,155
England would never forgive you.

921
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,988
Do you promise never
to return to England?

922
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:43,447
Gladly.

923
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:47,988
I prefer the sun of the
Orient to your climate.

924
01:09:48,012 --> 01:09:50,530
Very well, then I agree.

925
01:09:53,512 --> 01:09:57,137
Come Lia, sit in this chair.

926
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:19,179
Drink deeply.

927
01:10:22,346 --> 01:10:23,387
Drink deeply.

928
01:10:27,804 --> 01:10:28,804
There.

929
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:33,637
Watch her, Doctor.

930
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,804
She will recover in a moment.

931
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:46,280
And now, Inspector, since you
are also a man of your word,

932
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:49,613
are you ready to give me a
safe conduct to the boat?

933
01:10:49,637 --> 01:10:51,697
I'll escort you myself.

934
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:55,488
Remember you promised never to return.

935
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:59,471
I hold promises very sacred, my friend.

936
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,721
- Jack?
- Yes, dear.

937
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:08,197
For example, I promised Dr. Petrie,

938
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:10,697
to return Lia's sanity.

939
01:11:10,721 --> 01:11:11,988
That I have done.

940
01:11:12,012 --> 01:11:15,863
There remains but one promise unfulfilled.

941
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:19,197
To avenge the death of my wife and child.

942
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:24,221
I have promised the gods of my
ancestors, Dr. Petrie's life.

943
01:11:24,929 --> 01:11:26,947
- No.
- Stand still!

944
01:11:26,971 --> 01:11:28,738
If one of you moves or cries out,

945
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:31,280
I will pull this contact pin

946
01:11:31,304 --> 01:11:33,179
and we shall all be blown to death.

947
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:36,637
I shall welcome death

948
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:39,155
for Dr. Petrie will die with me.

949
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:41,697
Then my life's work will be finished,

950
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:46,488
but Dr. Petrie can save you
all by taking his own life.

951
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:48,780
No, no, no!

952
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,988
To show you that I am not
entirely devoid of feeling,

953
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:57,072
I have arranged a quick
and painless death.

954
01:11:57,096 --> 01:12:00,280
In the white bottle on the top shelf

955
01:12:00,304 --> 01:12:05,304
is a potion which will immediately
blot out your existence.

956
01:12:06,471 --> 01:12:09,280
You are brave and will not hesitate

957
01:12:09,304 --> 01:12:12,887
to sacrifice your life for those you love.

958
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,697
I shall not wait, drink.

959
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:18,947
In 10 seconds it will explode.

960
01:12:18,971 --> 01:12:21,530
If you will drink the poison,
I will throw this bomb

961
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:22,554
into the river.

962
01:12:23,262 --> 01:12:27,238
If not, see, I have pulled the pin!

963
01:12:27,262 --> 01:12:28,613
I'll take you.

964
01:12:37,929 --> 01:12:39,304
It's all over, Petrie.

965
01:12:40,471 --> 01:12:41,846
There are no more chapters.

966
01:12:43,012 --> 01:12:44,137
The book is closed.

967
01:12:44,179 --> 01:12:45,887
Is everything all right?

968
01:12:48,512 --> 01:12:50,679
I knew it would all come out all right.

969
01:12:51,637 --> 01:12:53,512
I never worried for a moment.
