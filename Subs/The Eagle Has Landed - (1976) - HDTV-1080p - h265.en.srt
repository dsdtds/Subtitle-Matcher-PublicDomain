1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,717
September 12, 1943.

2
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,925
German paratroopers
snatched Mussolini

3
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:32,467
from his mountaintop prison in Italy.

4
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:39,258
This daring and successful exploit
stunned the world.

5
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,926
Inspired by the rescue of his ally,

6
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,218
Hitler ordered
an even more daring bid

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,967
to capture his greatest enemy.

8
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:05,860
- Morning.
- Good morning, Herr Admiral.

9
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:12,110
- Oberst Radl... send him to me at once.
- I have notified him of your arrival.

10
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:14,361
Thank you.

11
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:30,820
- Come in, Radl.
- Herr Admiral.

12
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:32,778
Come and sit down.

13
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:40,778
The meeting went well?
The Fiihrer had something specific in mind?

14
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,237
A simple exercise in logistics.

15
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,529
Nothing very complicated.

16
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:54,237
He merely wants Winston Churchill

17
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,695
brought from London to Berlin!

18
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:04,362
And we are ordered
to make a feasibility study.

19
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:09,612
Today's Wednesday.
By Friday, he will forget it.

20
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:12,320
But Himmler will not.

21
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:15,154
Reichsführer Himmler approved?

22
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:18,320
Only of my being put on the spot.

23
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:21,071
You should have seen that meeting.

24
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:25,238
There was Hitler, ranting, cajoling,

25
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,487
then perfectly rational,

26
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:31,112
then raging and stamping like a...

27
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,571
like the ringmaster
of some freak circus!

28
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:37,321
Goebbels, hopping from
one foot to another like a...

29
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:38,821
like a schoolboy!

30
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,696
Bormann... a vulture!

31
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:48,321
Perched in the corner,
watching, listening, never speaking!

32
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,655
And Mussolini... Mussolini!

33
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,071
An automaton, Radl.

34
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:56,571
I looked round that room,

35
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:00,655
and I wondered,
"Am I the only one who can see it?"

36
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:05,738
And if so,
what must I look like to them?

37
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:13,822
Admiral, the feasibility study...

38
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:19,738
Will be a total
and unnecessary waste of time.

39
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,656
Make it immediately.

40
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,947
Complete for the last month.

41
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,489
If Herr Oberst could give me
a rough idea of our problem...

42
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:37,864
I can be quite specific about it.

43
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:41,656
The Führer has instructed us
to kidnap Winston Churchill.

44
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:43,572
Good God!

45
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:46,823
Well, Karl,
do at least a feasibility study on it.

46
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:51,156
Something which might fit our needs
came in yesterday.

47
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,948
Just a mention, if I may, sir...

48
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,198
Eh, no...

49
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,614
Ja, here it is.

50
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:01,697
From Codename Starling.

51
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:04,532
A village in England
called Studley Constable.

52
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,240
How do we receive reports
from this Starling?

53
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:18,031
From the Spanish Embassy in London,
by diplomatic pouch.

54
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:20,323
There is also a radio contact.

55
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:25,615
Exactly where is... Studley Constable?

56
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:30,032
The east coast of England,
the county of Norfolk.

57
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,907
Let's have a look at the place.

58
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,908
- Larger scale.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

59
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,074
Ah, here.

60
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:14,449
Ah! Herr Oberst.

61
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:29,450
Isolated coastline, very rural,
wide beaches, salt marshes.

62
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,700
Ideal.

63
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:36,325
Now, a man to lead it, Karl.

64
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:54,575
"Crash-landed, 1940,
glider assault, Belgium.

65
00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:00,368
Dropped into Crete, '41.
Wounded at Maleme, Knight's Cross.

66
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,368
Led volunteer assault, group of 300,
special action, Leningrad.

67
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:08,576
Stalingrad... Knight's Cross
with Oak Leaves and Swords.

68
00:08:09,826 --> 00:08:13,076
January this year, dropped into Kiev,
with 167 surviving in unit,

69
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,867
to get two cut-off regiments
out of Russia.

70
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:19,576
Oberst Kurt Steiner."

71
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:24,243
- What is the language?
- "Educated in England."

72
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:40,993
Third time in the last month.
Despite Goering's personal guarantee.

73
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,660
Are you familiar with Jung's works?

74
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:51,576
I am aware of them,
not familiar, Herr Oberst.

75
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,952
A great thinker, a rational man...

76
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:01,202
and yet he speaks of something
called "synchronicity"...

77
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,993
events having a coincidence in time,

78
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,452
so that one feels
a much deeper motivation is involved.

79
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:10,577
- Ja, I understand.
- Take this affair.

80
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:17,327
The Führer comes up with an absurd
suggestion that we abduct Churchill.

81
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,577
For political reasons, we are prodded
into making a worthless report on this.

82
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:25,119
Suddenly, synchronicity
rears its disturbing head.

83
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:26,452
Ja, I see that.

84
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:29,536
We receive a routine report
with a brief notation

85
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,119
that next month after visiting
a local bomber command,

86
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:34,953
Churchill will spend the weekend

87
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:40,036
in a country manor less than 7 miles
from a deserted coastline.

88
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,411
At any other time,
this report would mean nothing.

89
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:48,953
At this particular time,
in that particular file...

90
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:54,912
it becomes a circumstance
which titillates,

91
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,620
a coincidence to... tease us.

92
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:05,995
Surely Herr Oberst doesn't really believe
this thing could be carried off?

93
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,204
A wink from a pretty girl at a party
results rarely in climax, Karl.

94
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:17,703
But a man is a fool not to push
the idea as far as it will go.

95
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:25,162
Find this man for me, Karl.
He's been out of Germany too long.

96
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,790
Hans. Hans!

97
00:11:59,873 --> 00:12:02,748
- Hmm?
- Let's stretch our legs.

98
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:22,998
Stay on the train!
No one allowed off the train!

99
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,832
I beg your pardon, sir.

100
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,374
Sir, I'm sorry,
but you must remain on the train.

101
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:38,415
If memory serves me,
the Polish Army surrendered in 1939.

102
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:39,998
Sir?

103
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:41,791
Who are these people?

104
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:45,666
- Well, Jews, sir.
- Jews?

105
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,999
We are razing the ghetto to the ground.
Burning them out.

106
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:54,582
- They put up a hell of a fight.
- Oh? How? With umbrellas and crutches?

107
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,833
Halt!

108
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:17,208
- I'll take the prisoner.
- "Prisoner"?

109
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,542
What is...

110
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,625
- What is your name?
- Brana.

111
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,334
Good luck, Brana.

112
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,960
Identify yourself.

113
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:20,584
Oberst Kurt Steiner, commanding
the Twelfth Parachute Detachment.

114
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:30,126
A salute is customary to a general,
Herr Oberst, even to one of the SS.

115
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:35,252
You didn't seem quite so discriminating
a moment ago.

116
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:39,377
I have nothing for or against
the Jews personally.

117
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,168
But I have seen too many
good men die for cause

118
00:14:42,502 --> 00:14:44,502
to watch a young girl
be killed for sport!

119
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,627
Sturmfijhrer Straub
was doing his duty.

120
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,210
He reminds me of something
I pick up on my shoe in the gutter!

121
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:53,710
Very unpleasant on a hot day.

122
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:58,335
If you have the dubious honour
of commanding this senseless slaughter,

123
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,752
I advise you to keep him downwind
at all times.

124
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:04,211
That's if you can
tell the difference anymore.

125
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,086
For God's sake, Kurt.

126
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:09,211
What am I to do with you?

127
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,127
You're a military hero,

128
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,669
awarded the Knight's Cross
with Oak Leaves and Swords.

129
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:20,336
Yet responsible for the attempted escape
of an enemy of the state,

130
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,545
abetted by the mutinous conduct
of your men!

131
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,961
By rights,
you should all be court-martialed!

132
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,961
Difficult decisions

133
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:36,127
are the privilege of rank,
Herr Gruppenfijhrer.

134
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:42,211
But as for my men...

135
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:48,670
they seem to feel
a certain... loyalty to me.

136
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:52,670
L, uh,

137
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:56,753
don't suppose you could
content yourself with my head

138
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:00,170
and overlook their part in this thing?

139
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:01,670
Huh?

140
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:08,337
There you are, you see, Hans?

141
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,462
It's infallible.

142
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:15,420
I can always tell a thoroughgoing bastard
when I see one.

143
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:36,129
- Herr Oberst?
- In here, Karl.

144
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,879
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

145
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:47,088
The material arrived from Starling.
It is excellent, Karl, truly excellent.

146
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,421
Starling's to be commended.

147
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:03,797
Ja, ja, that is good.

148
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,005
What news of Oberst Steiner?

149
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:08,463
Well, we are having some difficulty
in tracing him.

150
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,255
He appears to be back in Germany,

151
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,547
but as to exactly where,
we have run into roadblocks.

152
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,547
Even rumors of a court-martial.
But we'll find him.

153
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,339
I'm sure of it.

154
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,047
And now... Here.
A possible undercover operative.

155
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:26,964
I've decided on this man.

156
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,657
He is currently lecturing
in that university here in Berlin.

157
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,839
- Send for him immediately.
- Yes.

158
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,548
Oh, and, Karl,
send this message to Starling.

159
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,422
Yes, Herr Oberst.

160
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:45,464
- Where is Herr Oberst Radl?
- In the map room, Herr Admiral.

161
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,130
Thank you.

162
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:54,422
This message has been sent out.
Did you originate it?

163
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,173
I did, Herr Admiral.

164
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:01,048
"Very interested in your visitor
of 6th November.

165
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:03,340
Would like to drop some friends
in to meet him

166
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:06,840
in the hope they might persuade him
to come back with them.

167
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,798
Your comments expected by usual route
with all relevant information."

168
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,631
You've exceeded your authority!

169
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:18,382
You were told to prepare this
feasibility study, not embellish a joke!

170
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:22,881
With Herr Admiral's permission
it is no longer a joke. It could be done.

171
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:27,965
- In my opinion, it should be done.
- What if Churchill prefers to die?

172
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:32,841
What if abduction
becomes assassination?

173
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:35,549
No one specified dead or alive.

174
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:41,507
God in heaven! Kill Churchill,
when we've already lost the war?

175
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,132
I'm sure you've done a good job, Radl.
Very thorough.

176
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:52,258
But this operation could make
the Charge of the Light Brigade

177
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,799
look like a sensible military exercise.

178
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,174
Drop it.

179
00:19:18,842 --> 00:19:22,550
Herr Oberst, he has arrived.

180
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,259
Come in, Colonel. Radl, isn't it?

181
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,509
Top 0' the morning to you.

182
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:48,092
It's not Irish whisky,
but it'll do to be going on with.

183
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:50,425
Better for you to drink than me.

184
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:54,217
I've a feeling I might be needing it.

185
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:57,342
"May I?

186
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:01,759
The last time I was invited up here
to Section Three,

187
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:05,217
one 0' the lads persuaded me
to jump out of a Dornier,

188
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,884
5,000 feet above Ireland,
in the dark.

189
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:10,634
And me with this terrible fear
of heights.

190
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:18,260
You planning a holiday to England, are you?
Brighton's lovely this time 0' year.

191
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:24,884
Mother of God!
What the Christ is that?

192
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:28,510
They're Russian, Mr. Devlin. I picked up
a taste for them in the Winter War.

193
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:32,593
They're probably the only thing
that kept you awake in the snow.

194
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:36,051
Here... and here.

195
00:20:40,552 --> 00:20:42,343
Now...

196
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,977
I had a proposition to put to you,
Mr. Devlin.

197
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,552
- "Had"?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:20:57,052 --> 00:20:58,177
Have.

199
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:03,177
- I'm working, you know, Colonel.
- At the University.

200
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:08,802
For a man like you, that must be like
a thoroughbred racehorse

201
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,719
finding himself...
pulling a milk cart.

202
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,261
Oh, you've got a way with the words.

203
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:17,594
You want me to go back to Ireland,
is that it?

204
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,636
Well, I can't do it.
I wouldn't last a week...

205
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,678
No, we don't want you
to go back to Ireland.

206
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:27,135
Now, you still support the IRA?

207
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:31,761
Soldier of, Colonel.
Once in, never out.

208
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:34,886
But you're here in Germany.
Why?

209
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,386
I don't like soft target hits.

210
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:42,387
I don't want to spend my days in Bayswater,
mixing up explosives

211
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,220
to blow the arms and legs
off passersby.

212
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:50,678
My fight is with the bloody British Empire.
I'll fight it on my own two feet.

213
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:55,970
If it's a rabid fanatic you want,
they sent you the wrong man.

214
00:21:56,303 --> 00:22:00,679
Your aim is still total victory
against England?

215
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:05,762
No, that's your aim.
My aim is a united Ireland.

216
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:10,804
Either way, it would be necessary
for Germany to win the war.

217
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:14,096
And pigs might fly, Colonel.

218
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,971
Mr. Devlin...

219
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:23,720
- I want you to go to England for me.
- Colonel, I barely know you.

220
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:28,554
To assist in the kidnapping
and safe return to Germany

221
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,429
of Winston Churchill.

222
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:38,555
Give me another one 0' them
Bolshevik firecrackers.

223
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,096
I think I fell asleep in the snow.

224
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,096
- Herr Oberst...
- Good evening, Herr Oberst.

225
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,346
I'm SturmbannführerTuberg
of the SS.

226
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,847
Reichsführer Himmler requests you

227
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,638
to bring him the entire
file of the plan known as "Eagle."

228
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:03,180
- When is that to be?
- Now, Herr Oberst.

229
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,555
You seem nervous, Herr Oberst.

230
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,680
Please relax.

231
00:23:19,305 --> 00:23:21,389
May I smoke, Herr Reichsführer?

232
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:25,264
No.

233
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:31,013
- A masterful job.
- Thank you, Herr Reichsführer.

234
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:34,430
But there are some people

235
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:36,639
who would say
that such an operation

236
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:39,806
could make
the Charge of the Light Brigade

237
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:43,181
look like a sensible exercise.

238
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:47,931
Have you heard that phrase before?

239
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:52,764
I don't immediately recall,
Herr Reichsführer.

240
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,265
I know about your plan.

241
00:23:55,597 --> 00:24:00,098
I know what is written
on every single page,

242
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:02,723
even the one you haven't got yet...

243
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:09,056
the court-martial of Herr Oberst Steiner
and his men.

244
00:24:11,306 --> 00:24:16,598
The arrogance of this Steiner
is dazzling.

245
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:24,099
An unusual man,
this, uh... this Steiner.

246
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:28,974
Intelligent, ruthless,
a brilliant soldier,

247
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:33,140
but, above all, a romantic fool.

248
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,349
He threw away everything...

249
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,432
rank, career, the future.

250
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,683
He's presently in a penal colony
on the island of, uh,

251
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:49,932
uh, Alderney.

252
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:54,891
And all for the sake
of some little Jewess!

253
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,724
You know he's a veteran
of five successful commando raids?

254
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:03,224
Six, I believe.

255
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:08,850
Educated in England. He speaks
the language perfectly, without an accent.

256
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:15,016
- The ideal man for the job, eh?
- If you think so, Herr Reichsführer.

257
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:21,100
And so do you. But the Herr Admiral,
Canaris, doesn't think so.

258
00:25:22,475 --> 00:25:24,267
My loyalty to Herr Admiral...

259
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,684
ls exceeded only by your loyalty
to the Führer himself.

260
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:31,850
Isn't that so?

261
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:34,767
I'm sure of it.

262
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:41,600
Now, this Churchill business-—
our Führer wants it seen through.

263
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,350
You have considerable autonomy
in running your office.

264
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:49,976
You ought to be able to use it.

265
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:55,475
As an excuse to prevent Canaris
from knowing what's going on.

266
00:25:55,809 --> 00:26:01,226
What kind of authority would I have
to carry such a project through?

267
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:22,184
Aloud, if you please.

268
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:31,476
"Oberst Radl is acting
under my personal orders

269
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:34,810
on a matter of great importance
to the Reich.

270
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:37,935
All military and civil personnel,

271
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:41,852
without distinction of rank,
will assist him in any way

272
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,060
that Oberst Radl sees fit to demand.

273
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:48,852
Adolf Hitler."

274
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:52,644
So, you see, Radl...

275
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:56,102
under the terms of that document,

276
00:26:56,435 --> 00:27:01,727
even I find myself
under your personal command.

277
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:09,853
Good luck.
I can only envy your inevitable success.

278
00:27:11,352 --> 00:27:14,103
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

279
00:28:18,312 --> 00:28:20,728
Major Neuhoff,
Commandant of the Island of Alderney.

280
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:22,563
A pleasure, Herr Oberst.

281
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,354
Read this, please.

282
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:35,354
I see!
What do you wish of me?

283
00:28:35,688 --> 00:28:38,980
You have a penal unit.
It terminates this moment.

284
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:41,604
Steiner and 29 men.

285
00:28:41,938 --> 00:28:45,146
18. There are only 18 now.

286
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:33,438
The men are required to ride the torpedoes
into enemy shipping.

287
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,356
- The torpedoes detach, of course?
- Of course.

288
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,064
Most of the time!

289
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:40,730
Burial detail,
the usual letters of commendation.

290
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:43,981
And for God's sake,
get the names right this time.

291
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:45,398
Thank you, Herr Neuhoff.

292
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,106
- But I thought...
- Thank you!

293
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,940
- Herr Steiner?
- Yes, I'm Steiner. What is it?

294
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:13,940
My name is Radl.

295
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:21,023
Well, what is it? I have two men to bury
and no office to make small talk in.

296
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,816
Your credentials are hopelessly
impeccable, Herr Oberst.

297
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,649
What can I do for you?

298
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,649
Lead a raiding party to England
to kidnap Churchill.

299
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,983
You don't seem very impressed.

300
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,024
I haven't seen your plan yet.

301
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:58,482
Here.

302
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:21,191
While he makes his decision,

303
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm going to that pub up there
and give some thought to mine.

304
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:27,942
The only time this plan
makes any sense to me is when I'm drunk.

305
00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:55,276
- You are in command here?
- Oberleutnant Koenig, Oberst.

306
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:59,609
These configurations seem
somewhat abnormal for an E-boat.

307
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:03,734
She's actually a converted
British MTB, Herr Oberst.

308
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:06,818
Captured making a drop
off the Dutch coast.

309
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,651
Sir.

310
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,442
- Do you know the east coast of England?
- Herr Oberst, I've been there.

311
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:19,776
For five years, I was first mate
on a cargo ship out of England.

312
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,569
This could work, you know.

313
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:18,528
It will be done.
It is the Führer's direct order.

314
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:24,944
I stood opposite Adolf once,
when he gave me this.

315
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,611
Oh, I forgot.
One of those.

316
00:33:28,944 --> 00:33:33,152
You're a German officer, you swore
the same oath. You have no choice.

317
00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:34,778
Of course I do.

318
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:38,278
I'm going to die here anyway.

319
00:33:38,611 --> 00:33:42,486
You forget, Radl, that I am under
suspended sentence of death.

320
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,820
Officially disgraced.

321
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:53,945
I do not retain my rank,
only my authority,

322
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,445
because of the, uh,
peculiar circumstances of this job.

323
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:02,612
I offer you a chance
for reinstatement of rank

324
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,487
and complete vindication
for you and your men.

325
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,362
My men need no vindication.

326
00:34:09,696 --> 00:34:13,404
- You said it could be done.
- It's possible.

327
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:16,904
Of all the world's leaders,

328
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:21,237
Churchill is probably the least protected,
unlike the Führer.

329
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,362
Steiner,

330
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,237
is thumbing your nose at the Führer
more important to you

331
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:28,737
than the lives of your men?

332
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:33,946
31 of you a few weeks ago.
How many left?

333
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:41,113
16.

334
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:44,904
You owe them this chance to live.

335
00:34:48,697 --> 00:34:51,655
Or to die in England instead.

336
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:02,738
I will put it to my men.
They are entitled to know.

337
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,905
Only the destination for now.

338
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:09,072
Revealing the target
would be going too far.

339
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:11,905
I will put it to my men.

340
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,697
Steiner,

341
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:21,822
it might make them think
about a negotiated peace, hmm?

342
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,947
A negotiated peace?

343
00:35:27,364 --> 00:35:30,364
I will put that to my men also.

344
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:39,155
God bless all here.
Give us a glass of your strongest, please.

345
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:41,072
Gestapo.

346
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:44,281
So that's how the Gestapo dresses
in Berlin these days.

347
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:47,364
- Gestapo?
- Drink?

348
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:15,532
I haven't sucked my thumb in years.
Would you be kind enough to do it for me?

349
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:19,865
- Sir?
- Suck it!

350
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:26,532
Now, about your Mr., uh, Devlin...

351
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:29,949
A man of considerable resource
and guile, I assure you.

352
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:41,490
Tell me, Mr. Devlin,
just why are you coming along?

353
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:46,074
Can't you tell? I'm the last
of the world's great adventurers.

354
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:58,241
Sweet Mary, Mother of God!

355
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,616
A tough bunch 0' lads
he's got in there, Colonel.

356
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:10,491
- What did he say?
- He insisted on the consent of his men.

357
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:11,950
I'm not surprised at that.

358
00:37:12,283 --> 00:37:15,449
- If they agree, you leave tonight.
- Tonight?

359
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:20,158
- You'll be dropped into southern Ireland.
- Tonight? But what about my papers?

360
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:24,200
Your Irish passport and British
medical discharge have been provided.

361
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,284
Starling's found you a job.

362
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:30,033
You'll be a marsh warden,
whatever that is.

363
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:33,117
It's a marsh warden.
What about the money?

364
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,033
- £10,000 first.
- I asked for £20,000.

365
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:39,409
£10,000 has been deposited in Geneva,
as per instructions.

366
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:42,117
Ten more upon completion
of the mission.

367
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:46,158
You think I'd sell out?

368
00:37:46,492 --> 00:37:49,950
It's just that you've been so expensive
to buy in the first place.

369
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:17,868
You are going to jump
in those clothes?

370
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:21,410
I might look a bit silly going down,

371
00:38:21,742 --> 00:38:24,909
but I'll be a hell of a lot safer
when I land.

372
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:30,869
There's an old poem which,
freely translated from the Irish, says:

373
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,702
"I realized fear one morning,

374
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:36,869
to the blare of the fox hunters' sound.

375
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:40,077
When they're chasing the poor fox,

376
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,410
it's safer to be dressed like a hound."

377
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:45,410
You're quite a literary man.

378
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:50,077
The truth be known, Colonel,
I'm a bloody literary genius.

379
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:54,493
Your complete instructions.

380
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:57,869
All of it? Everything?
No cyanide pill?

381
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,660
I couldn't think of a situation
which would make you take one.

382
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,244
A little trick I learned
from an uncle in Belfast.

383
00:39:18,578 --> 00:39:23,244
In the Middle Ages,
they'd have burned you for that.

384
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,703
Good-bye.
I will see you in England.

385
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:29,452
I'll be there.

386
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,995
How do I jump out 0' this thing?

387
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,619
Release your safety belt.

388
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:45,703
I turn the plane upside-down,
you drop out.

389
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,579
The signature on that authorization
could just be a clever forgery!

390
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:57,120
Fly to Berchtesgaden and ask him.

391
00:39:57,453 --> 00:40:00,579
Oh, let's not bother the man.

392
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:43,164
Mrs. Joanna Grey?

393
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:47,123
That's right.

394
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:48,998
Liam Devlin.

395
00:41:50,664 --> 00:41:53,206
I could do with a cup of tea.
It was a hell of a journey.

396
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,748
Come inside.

397
00:42:43,915 --> 00:42:47,833
- That's a neat trick.
- Your Wolfhound and me are both Irish.

398
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:51,249
- What's her name?
- Patch.

399
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,749
Ah, Patch.

400
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,250
Sit down, Mr. Devlin.

401
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:11,708
It's lovely, the countryside, isn't it?

402
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,000
You'd hardly know there was a war.

403
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,417
Patch.

404
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:19,916
They're living in a fool's paradise.

405
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:23,083
They lack the discipline
the Fuihrer has brought to Germany.

406
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,458
You'll need these papers.

407
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:30,458
I'll give you these...
the ones they gave to me.

408
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:33,709
Sir Henry is away.

409
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,792
Only the servants
are in the manor house.

410
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:39,417
Who else knows Churchill
will be here?

411
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,792
Only Father Verecker.

412
00:43:44,126 --> 00:43:46,834
Your duties
will be mainly game-keeping.

413
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:52,251
I've got you a motorbike
and you can have this shotgun.

414
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,834
It is loaded.

415
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:57,614
You know the way to the cottage?

416
00:43:57,917 --> 00:44:01,376
I go down the road.
There's a pub on my right.

417
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:05,126
And I go through the manor house gates,
down the end of the lane.

418
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:07,251
The keys.

419
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:09,418
Oh, by the way,

420
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:14,167
the ration allowance for petrol
is only three gallons a month.

421
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:16,917
I hope I won't be here that long.

422
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,501
Good day to you, Colleen.

423
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:44,877
God save the good work.

424
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,918
- Watch your back.
- My back?

425
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:50,252
- Mr. Devlin.
- Mr. Devlin?

426
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:54,669
Mrs. Grey told us all about you
at the last WVS meeting.

427
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:59,252
- You're the new marsh warden.
- You're with Women's Voluntary Service?

428
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:03,252
I help out when I have the time.

429
00:45:04,544 --> 00:45:08,460
Sort of, urn, servicing the troops?

430
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:10,836
I don't mind.

431
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:13,419
Miss, I do believe
you're a little bit of a tease.

432
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:17,253
Children tease, Mr. Devlin.
I'm almost 19.

433
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:19,502
- Ah.
- Go on!

434
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:46,545
God bless all here. Can I have
a glass of your strongest, please?

435
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:50,503
- I'm George Wilde, the publican.
- Liam Devlin, marsh warden.

436
00:45:50,837 --> 00:45:52,253
That's Arthur Seymour.

437
00:45:52,587 --> 00:45:55,045
By the fire is Laker Armsby.

438
00:45:55,378 --> 00:46:00,004
- Will you take a drink?
- A pint of bitter wouldn't be a burden.

439
00:46:00,336 --> 00:46:02,087
- Sir?
- I buys me own!

440
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:05,087
Coming in here all grand,
with a shotgun and your motorbike.

441
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:09,254
Buying drinks for us who's worked the estate
for years for less than he gets.

442
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:12,712
It can only be
because of my good looks.

443
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:15,837
Laugh at me
and I'll squash you like a slug!

444
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,837
Arthur.

445
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,629
You walk soft around here,

446
00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:24,421
you keep your place,
and you stay away from Molly Prior!

447
00:46:24,754 --> 00:46:27,421
- If I've caused offense, I'm sorry.
- Arthur.

448
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,296
Now, get out.

449
00:46:30,629 --> 00:46:35,588
Today I leave, boy. But from now on,
when you see me, you leave.

450
00:46:45,088 --> 00:46:46,588
1/9d, please.

451
00:47:42,256 --> 00:47:44,256
- Good day, Father.
- Oh, good afternoon.

452
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,590
Liam Devlin.
I'm Sir Henry's new marsh warden.

453
00:47:47,922 --> 00:47:50,506
I'm just introducing myself.

454
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,381
Oh, I'm Father Verecker.

455
00:47:52,673 --> 00:47:57,923
This is my sister, Pamela.
She's on a weekend leave.

456
00:47:58,256 --> 00:48:00,798
- That's your sister? How do you do?
- How do you do?

457
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:04,048
- I'll be back for tea. Bye.
- Bye, Mr. Devlin.

458
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,673
Good-bye.

459
00:48:06,007 --> 00:48:10,381
We have a small congregation here.
I look forward to your adding to it.

460
00:48:10,673 --> 00:48:13,423
- You are Catholic?
- Oh, yes, Father.

461
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:16,299
Did you come for confession?

462
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:20,882
Father, I'm afraid this poor soul
is well past redemption.

463
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:25,715
I could do with a spicy revelation
every now and then.

464
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:30,424
And don't forget the words of our Lord...
"The last shall be the first."

465
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:33,882
Then I'm assured a place
at the head of the line.

466
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,382
Where did you find this?

467
00:48:48,674 --> 00:48:52,133
A DC3, captured almost intact.

468
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:36,550
- Gericke?
- Herr Oberst?

469
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:40,301
- Will it be ready in time?
- No problem.

470
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:45,093
Where did she go, eh?

471
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:50,011
All right, my friend.

472
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:17,760
What kept you?

473
00:51:19,136 --> 00:51:23,844
What kept me?
Why, you little devil!

474
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:29,177
God, I'll know you till
the crack 0' Doomsday, that's for sure.

475
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:33,511
- What does that mean?
- It's an expression they have in Ireland.

476
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:35,469
- Do you use these things?
- No.

477
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:37,386
Good for you.

478
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:41,845
They stunt your growth, and you
with your green years ahead of you.

479
00:51:42,178 --> 00:51:44,845
Almost 19, eh?

480
00:51:46,262 --> 00:51:48,511
- What month?
- February.

481
00:51:50,928 --> 00:51:53,053
- Twenty-fifth?
- Twenty-second.

482
00:51:54,803 --> 00:51:57,429
But I was right, though,
that you're a little fish.

483
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:00,845
You and me should get along well,
me being a Scorpio.

484
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:02,761
Never marry a Virgo, though.

485
00:52:03,095 --> 00:52:05,262
Virgo and Pisces never hit it off.

486
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:10,470
I've a terrible hunch Arthur is a Virgo.
Watch it with him.

487
00:52:10,804 --> 00:52:12,137
Arthur?

488
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:16,220
- Arthur Seymour? Are you crazy?
- No, but I think he is.

489
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:20,846
Pure, clean, virtuous...

490
00:52:21,178 --> 00:52:22,679
and not very hot.

491
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:24,512
That's a Virgo.

492
00:52:24,846 --> 00:52:28,179
It's a terrible shame
from where I'm lying.

493
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:32,929
You'll have a terrible problem with
your weight if you don't watch your food.

494
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:34,679
Bastard.

495
00:52:35,762 --> 00:52:37,221
Are you laughing at me?

496
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,597
What else would you have me do
with you, Molly Prior?

497
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:43,388
No, don't answer that.

498
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,054
How do you know my name?

499
00:52:46,388 --> 00:52:48,846
George Wilde told me in the pub.

500
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:52,722
I see.
And Arthur, was he there?

501
00:52:53,054 --> 00:52:55,179
You could say that.

502
00:52:55,513 --> 00:52:59,722
He seems to look upon you
as his personal property.

503
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:04,139
- He can go to hell! I belong to no man!
- You know your nose turns up?

504
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,471
And when you get angry,
your mouth turns down at the corners.

505
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:12,513
I'm sure you could find a hundred things
wrong with me, Mr. Devlin. A thousand.

506
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:15,972
But you wouldn't throw me out of your bed
on a wet Saturday night.

507
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:19,638
But that's men for you.
Anything's better than nothing.

508
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:21,722
Wait! Wait a minute.
Come here.

509
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:26,889
You don't know the first thing about me,
because if you did,

510
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:32,014
you'd know that I much prefer
a warm afternoon under the pines

511
00:53:32,347 --> 00:53:34,764
to a wet Saturday night any day.

512
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:41,389
The sand has a terrible way
of getting where it shouldn't do.

513
00:53:48,723 --> 00:53:52,140
Now get out of here, before I let
my mad passion run away with me.

514
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:54,389
Go on, get. Get.

515
00:54:09,473 --> 00:54:14,515
They told me all Irishmen were crazy!
Now I believe them.

516
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:17,056
I'll be at Mass on Sunday, will you?

517
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:22,223
- Do I look like I will?
- Yes, I think you do.

518
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:36,724
Oh, Devlin, you bloody idiot.

519
00:54:37,932 --> 00:54:42,473
You never learn.
Never bloody learn.

520
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:44,515
I've spoken with Himmler.

521
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:48,141
He send personal wishes
for success from the Fijhrer.

522
00:54:50,349 --> 00:54:52,600
You've altered the parachutes.
Why?

523
00:54:52,932 --> 00:54:57,849
Unfortunately, we have high tide
at first light when we must drop,

524
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:00,474
so we may land in the surf.

525
00:55:00,808 --> 00:55:04,600
These slots enable us
to guide the chutes.

526
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:09,600
It's experimental and the landing velocity
is high, but we have no choice.

527
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:14,600
- I assume they've been tested?
- Jawohl, Oberst.

528
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,100
I have one request.

529
00:55:31,475 --> 00:55:34,183
A demand, actually.

530
00:55:34,517 --> 00:55:36,766
Blackmail at this point, hmm?

531
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,892
We are not spies,

532
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:44,975
and we will not be treated as such
by the British if anything goes wrong.

533
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:50,517
We will wear our own uniforms
under the Polish outfits,

534
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:54,475
and, if necessary,
we will fight and die

535
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:58,143
as what we are...
German paratroopers.

536
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:06,018
Max, it is not a subject for negotiation.

537
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:11,642
- In that case, agreed.
- Thank you.

538
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:34,268
- Hello, Liam.
- My compliments on the dress.

539
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:36,518
It's a great improvement.

540
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,435
Why pick on me?

541
00:56:42,768 --> 00:56:46,852
Because you're lovely. Because you
could never fall in love with me.

542
00:56:47,185 --> 00:56:49,810
But I might, just for spite.

543
00:56:50,144 --> 00:56:53,768
It wouldn't matter.
I could never fall in love with you.

544
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:57,144
I'm no good for you at all.
There's no future in it.

545
00:56:57,477 --> 00:57:01,852
I tell you that 'cause it's the truth.

546
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:05,060
I'm here.
It's your turn to leave.

547
00:57:07,352 --> 00:57:08,977
Oh, God.

548
00:57:23,185 --> 00:57:27,186
Arthur, did I ever tell you
about my uncle in Belfast?

549
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:31,103
No, of course I didn't.

550
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:40,644
He earned his living
as a bare-knuckle boxer.

551
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:55,604
I'm just telling him
about the Holy Trinity.

552
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,645
You know it?

553
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:03,604
Footwork, timing and hitting.

554
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:12,520
And a little bit of dirty work.

555
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:17,146
"Learn these," my uncle said,

556
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:19,604
"and you'll inherit the earth
as surely as the meek."

557
00:58:19,937 --> 00:58:22,104
You never know when do lie down,
do you, Arthur?

558
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:24,146
Liam!

559
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:43,396
Looks like he bought you
a drink after all.

560
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,939
It's perfect.
Which way is England?

561
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:01,898
You!
Tell Oberst Radl who you are.

562
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:06,315
Kapral Andrej Jankowski,
Pulkowniku.

563
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:07,773
You!

564
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:14,065
Kapral Stanislaw Kunickski,
Pulkowniku, as you very well know.

565
01:00:14,398 --> 01:00:16,481
Get back in line.

566
01:00:35,857 --> 01:00:37,773
I'm very much impressed.

567
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:43,024
You know, it all started as a joke.

568
01:00:43,357 --> 01:00:47,649
I hope Churchill appreciates
our sense of humour.

569
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:51,941
- Good luck, Steiner.
- Thank you, Max.

570
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,526
Falcon, this is Eagle.
Are you receiving me?

571
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:05,401
Eagle, this is Falcon,
receiving you.

572
01:02:05,734 --> 01:02:07,817
What are conditions over the nest?

573
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:11,318
Visibility good. Cloud cover low.
Wind freshening.

574
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:13,776
Eagle, out.

575
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:47,319
Well, what do you think his game is?

576
01:02:47,652 --> 01:02:50,776
Black market or worse?

577
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:57,903
There's two army trucks outside,
without numbers on... yet.

578
01:02:58,235 --> 01:03:00,819
This... German!

579
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,611
It's worse.

580
01:03:03,944 --> 01:03:07,152
Arthur, if you love me,
you won't say a word until...

581
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:10,694
I'll have that bastard arrested
within the hour.

582
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:12,402
I've never meant to tease you.

583
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:17,402
- I know I have but I never meant to.
- You lying little tart!

584
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:21,445
I love him, Arthur! What you do to him
you do to me as well.

585
01:03:22,861 --> 01:03:24,403
You can both rot in hell!

586
01:03:24,736 --> 01:03:28,278
Stop, Arthur!
I won't let you go!

587
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:29,321
Mother 0' God. Flyin' pigs.

588
01:06:09,282 --> 01:06:14,073
- Have you found out who Starling is yet?
- Of course.

589
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:17,282
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm hoping it's not him.

590
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,532
It isn't.
I want him buried right away.

591
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:32,240
- Brandt, bring two men.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst!

592
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:56,074
Reichsführer,
I have the honour to announce

593
01:06:56,408 --> 01:06:58,450
the Eagle has landed.

594
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:02,325
I am very pleased to hear it.

595
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:05,408
I return to Alderney shortly.

596
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:08,658
I would be honoured
if you would tell our Führer.

597
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,408
I will tell the Führer nothing.

598
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,575
For a variety of reasons,
I would prefer this to come...

599
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:16,742
How shall I put it?

600
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:19,742
I would prefer it to come
as a surprise to him.

601
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:24,241
- How much of a surprise could it be?
- You have the letter?

602
01:07:30,283 --> 01:07:33,326
These are difficult times,
Herr Oberst.

603
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:36,700
The destiny of Germany
rests on his shoulders.

604
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:40,992
It is essential we avail ourselves
of this opportunity to please him.

605
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,200
We are all in
Oberst Steiner's hands now.

606
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:11,409
Hello, Grandfather.

607
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:16,451
- Foreigners?
- Polish. Corporal Kunickski.

608
01:08:18,035 --> 01:08:21,993
Kunickski?
That's not your fault.

609
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,161
Oh, please, don't stop.

610
01:09:23,494 --> 01:09:25,620
My apologies, Father.

611
01:09:25,952 --> 01:09:29,995
I am Corporal Andrej Jankowski.
I was sent to find you.

612
01:09:30,328 --> 01:09:32,912
However, I could not help myself.

613
01:09:33,244 --> 01:09:38,120
I don't blame you. You play marvelously.
Bach needs to be played well.

614
01:09:38,494 --> 01:09:41,620
I remember it with frustration
every time I take that seat.

615
01:09:41,953 --> 01:09:44,786
I'm sorry, Father,
but my Colonel...

616
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,287
Yes. Yes.

617
01:10:09,245 --> 01:10:11,162
- Father Verecker, is it?
- Yes.

618
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:15,203
Colonel Miller, assigned to command
the Independent Polish Parachute Unit.

619
01:10:15,537 --> 01:10:17,329
Colonel Miller,
what can I do for you?

620
01:10:17,662 --> 01:10:22,079
Well, we're on an exercise.
I only have a handful of my men here.

621
01:10:22,412 --> 01:10:26,829
The rest are scattered over Norfolk.
There is a rendezvous tomorrow,

622
01:10:27,163 --> 01:10:32,204
but I'd like to take these chaps
on maneuvers through the village.

623
01:10:32,537 --> 01:10:35,204
If that wouldn't be too
much of a burden for you.

624
01:10:35,538 --> 01:10:38,954
On the contrary, Colonel.
We could do with some excitement.

625
01:10:39,288 --> 01:10:42,455
I'm sure that the villagers
will do everything they can to help.

626
01:10:42,787 --> 01:10:45,079
Well, I shall be counting...

627
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:49,996
counting on that, Father.

628
01:10:56,038 --> 01:10:59,955
Phillip, this is Captain Harry Clark
of the American Rangers.

629
01:11:00,288 --> 01:11:01,889
- How do you do, Father?
- How do you do?

630
01:11:01,914 --> 01:11:03,580
My sister's told me about you.

631
01:11:03,914 --> 01:11:08,080
Pamela, this is Colonel Miller.
My sister Pamela.

632
01:11:08,413 --> 01:11:10,289
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

633
01:11:10,622 --> 01:11:11,788
And Captain Clark.

634
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:13,872
- Colonel.
- Captain.

635
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:19,164
- Are you staying for tea?
- I'm sorry. I must go, Father.

636
01:11:21,497 --> 01:11:22,857
We had no idea you guys were here.

637
01:11:23,164 --> 01:11:27,914
You're quite a surprise to our group.

638
01:11:29,997 --> 01:11:33,831
- Free Polish paratroopers, huh?
- Yes, that's right.

639
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:35,873
Listen, we've got some Polish guys.

640
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:37,831
Maybe you'd like to meet them?

641
01:11:38,164 --> 01:11:42,414
Maybe later.
Where are you staying?

642
01:11:42,706 --> 01:11:45,123
Eight miles away,
at Meltham House.

643
01:11:45,497 --> 01:11:48,081
What sort of strength
would you have there?

644
01:11:48,414 --> 01:11:50,456
We're just a company.

645
01:11:50,789 --> 01:11:53,873
Meltham House. I'll remember that.
Miss Verecker.

646
01:11:54,206 --> 01:11:55,497
- Good-bye.
- Father, thank you.

647
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:58,206
- Not at all, Colonel.
- Captain.

648
01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:01,706
Have the men hang on by the truck.

649
01:12:07,706 --> 01:12:10,749
Let's see the rest of the village.

650
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:12,624
Don't drive too slowly...

651
01:12:12,956 --> 01:12:16,123
And on the left-hand side
of the road.

652
01:12:24,999 --> 01:12:27,124
Foreigners. Poles.

653
01:12:27,498 --> 01:12:29,082
And Yanks, too.

654
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:30,415
And Irish.

655
01:12:30,665 --> 01:12:33,332
Get back in your foxhole, Laker.
You're being invaded.

656
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:08,958
What you been doing
in that uniform, Captain?

657
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:13,458
Moss, you did not get those three rockers
by asking stupid questions.

658
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:16,333
What is it now?
ls the new outfit arriving?

659
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:18,958
No, sir.
He wants to see you.

660
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,708
Sir!

661
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:32,334
Eight years...

662
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:35,292
Eight years in the National Guard,
every other weekend.

663
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,500
Two weeks out of the year
up to my ass in swamp water.

664
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,709
I can feel those mosquitoes!

665
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,667
But I made it.
I got my rank.

666
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,125
You were at Benning
when I got my command.

667
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,043
The best goddamn outfit
a man could hope to have.

668
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:54,334
11 weeks' training for this mission.

669
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:57,417
In two days, we hit the beach.

670
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:00,209
That was my last chance

671
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:03,751
to get my feet wet in action
before this goddamn war is over!

672
01:14:04,084 --> 01:14:05,084
And now this!

673
01:14:05,376 --> 01:14:08,792
- You won't be leading us in, sir?
- The bastards are sending me home!

674
01:14:12,585 --> 01:14:14,876
Read this! Go ahead! Top line!

675
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:18,335
Pitts, Clarence E. 016838621.

676
01:14:18,668 --> 01:14:22,209
Reassignment...
Fort Benning, Georgia.

677
01:14:22,543 --> 01:14:25,293
Air transportation, Priority 2.

678
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,793
They're not even in a hurry!

679
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:31,043
Gosh.
Can't you do anything, Colonel?

680
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:34,126
Look at the signatures on it!

681
01:14:34,501 --> 01:14:39,044
Not one of those men saw combat!
Not one!

682
01:14:41,668 --> 01:14:43,877
What do you want?
Why are you here?

683
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:48,419
- Sir.
- Fort Benning, Georgia!

684
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:51,419
You know how hot it is
in Fort Benning, Georgia?

685
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,710
I could have been in on the finish!

686
01:14:54,044 --> 01:14:55,668
Wait till my daddy hears about it!

687
01:15:12,753 --> 01:15:16,419
Keep up this foolishness
for 20 minutes, Hans,

688
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:19,045
then gradually establish
the roadblocks.

689
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:22,128
Slowly.
Two men at a time.

690
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:27,295
- Yes, that's coming along nicely.
- Thank you, sir.

691
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,836
- Very impressive.
- Thank you, Father.

692
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:39,545
My new orders call for me
to be heading down into the marshes.

693
01:15:39,878 --> 01:15:41,629
Do you know of anyone?

694
01:15:41,961 --> 01:15:45,670
As fate would have it, Colonel,
lam the official marsh warden.

695
01:15:46,003 --> 01:15:47,670
Liam Devlin at your service.

696
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:49,878
What a bit of good luck.

697
01:15:50,211 --> 01:15:53,086
- Colonel, I'm Mrs. Grey.
- How do you do?

698
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,587
As Mr. Devlin has been in my employ
for less than two days,

699
01:15:56,921 --> 01:16:01,754
I might suggest a third person along
to ensure we don't lose you both.

700
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:07,545
- I don't suppose I could impose?
- Not at all. I'd be delighted.

701
01:16:07,879 --> 01:16:12,254
- Why don't we, eh...
- Yes, please do.

702
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:18,004
- Here.
- I'll get in the back.

703
01:16:54,713 --> 01:16:57,838
- Any further news of Churchill?
- Yes, the party's left King's Lynn.

704
01:16:58,172 --> 01:17:02,255
In the house,
is there another escape route?

705
01:17:02,588 --> 01:17:05,422
There's an entrance at the rear
and one opposite the church.

706
01:17:08,005 --> 01:17:10,255
Yes.
Let's hope it won't be necessary.

707
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:14,547
What a lovely day for fantasies.

708
01:17:16,172 --> 01:17:21,088
The Colonel's...
that he'll be able to pull this thing off.

709
01:17:21,422 --> 01:17:25,672
Mine... a cup of tea
and a country girl.

710
01:17:26,006 --> 01:17:29,339
And Mrs. Grey's...
that even after all of this is over,

711
01:17:29,672 --> 01:17:32,339
she's still going to be asked
to be Lady Willoughby.

712
01:17:32,672 --> 01:17:34,839
Sir Henry
is a pleasant enough dullard.

713
01:17:35,173 --> 01:17:40,547
He and my late husband were partners
in a South African venture.

714
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:42,756
South African.

715
01:17:43,089 --> 01:17:46,173
That's what I can hear in your voice...
Afrikaans.

716
01:17:46,506 --> 01:17:48,756
My mother, since you noticed.

717
01:17:49,089 --> 01:17:53,131
She and my sister died there
in a British concentration camp.

718
01:17:54,506 --> 01:17:57,423
Or did you think
the Nazis invented them?

719
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:00,923
Revenge... a classic motive.

720
01:18:01,256 --> 01:18:04,298
Do you have a motive, Mr. Devlin?

721
01:18:04,632 --> 01:18:07,131
Regrettably, no.

722
01:18:07,506 --> 01:18:11,173
So, if someone else

723
01:18:11,506 --> 01:18:14,007
had asked you
to abduct Adolf Hitler,

724
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,798
you would be in Berlin right now?

725
01:18:17,132 --> 01:18:22,924
If all this lunacy doesn't work out,
Colonel, that's not a bad idea.

726
01:18:44,507 --> 01:18:47,257
Thank you, Colonel.

727
01:18:49,049 --> 01:18:51,424
- Can I buy you a drink, Colonel?
- Not right now.

728
01:18:51,758 --> 01:18:52,758
- Mrs. Grey?
- No.

729
01:18:53,008 --> 01:18:55,799
Then I'll be off.
I hope I've been of help.

730
01:18:56,133 --> 01:18:58,925
I don't know how
we would've managed without you.

731
01:18:59,257 --> 01:19:02,424
Perhaps we'll meet later, hmm?
Somewhere in the marsh.

732
01:19:02,716 --> 01:19:04,591
It's a very large marsh, Colonel.

733
01:19:04,925 --> 01:19:10,258
Good luck with your maneuvers.
Success. Ma'am.

734
01:19:47,675 --> 01:19:49,092
Stop the wheel.

735
01:19:49,425 --> 01:19:52,134
Susan!

736
01:19:54,134 --> 01:19:55,675
Get his body off the wheel.

737
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:04,343
Father, look at that uniform!

738
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:06,593
It's a German.

739
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:11,259
It's the Ger...

740
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,885
- My God, you're a German.
- More bloody foreigners.

741
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:19,301
- Altman, the switchboard.
- Jawohl!

742
01:20:19,635 --> 01:20:23,676
You two, the manor house.
Take these people into the church!

743
01:20:25,259 --> 01:20:29,426
Colonel, I know what you're doing.

744
01:20:29,718 --> 01:20:31,676
You won't stand a chance.

745
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:34,843
Well, I insist on giving it a try.

746
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:37,344
Hans, get the men in position.

747
01:20:37,676 --> 01:20:41,135
Don't let anyone out of the village.

748
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:42,843
Jawohl.

749
01:20:58,385 --> 01:21:01,053
Molly, what is it?

750
01:21:02,928 --> 01:21:05,094
I must see Father.

751
01:21:07,802 --> 01:21:10,719
- I have to talk to him.
- Yes, of course you can.

752
01:21:11,886 --> 01:21:13,469
Something terrible has happened.

753
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:17,761
It's all right. Stay here.

754
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:20,886
I'll get Phillip now.

755
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:38,136
Molly!
Come with me! Quickly.

756
01:22:15,346 --> 01:22:20,429
Mr. and Mrs. Wilde,
will you take a seat, please?

757
01:22:20,721 --> 01:22:23,763
Mr. Laker, sit over there.

758
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,055
This door is locked. Why?

759
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,347
It's the sacristy.

760
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,888
It's where I keep the church records
and my vestments.

761
01:22:58,513 --> 01:23:02,305
The key is at my house.
I'll go and fetch it if you like.

762
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,013
That won't be necessary.

763
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:09,847
So, you intend to kill Mr. Churchill

764
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,555
as he passes through here today?

765
01:23:11,889 --> 01:23:13,764
What an astonishing notion.

766
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:15,889
Give it up.

767
01:23:16,221 --> 01:23:18,014
There's no surprise left.

768
01:23:18,347 --> 01:23:21,430
Perhaps just one surprise left,
Father,

769
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:24,056
your good Lord willing.

770
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:32,931
God, these are Germans.

771
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:37,722
I must tell...
I must tell Harry.

772
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:41,431
Oh, Phillip's probably
got the keys to his car.

773
01:23:41,765 --> 01:23:45,848
Mrs. Grey's got one,
and Liam's got his bike.

774
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:48,139
Oh, good!
Don't worry, Molly.

775
01:23:48,514 --> 01:23:53,556
Go to Liam, and then go and tell
Captain Clark what's happened.

776
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:55,848
- But there must be...
- Molly!

777
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,473
I'll try and find him.

778
01:23:59,806 --> 01:24:02,348
All right.
Now, come on.

779
01:24:04,348 --> 01:24:06,598
At times like these,

780
01:24:06,932 --> 01:24:12,098
there's very little left but prayer,
and it frequently helps.

781
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:01,516
What do you think
our chances are?

782
01:25:01,849 --> 01:25:04,183
The E-boat is off the coast, Hans.

783
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:08,725
Churchill is on schedule.
Anything is possible.

784
01:25:32,351 --> 01:25:34,808
Joanna! Joanna!

785
01:25:35,142 --> 01:25:38,642
I'm coming! I'm coming!

786
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:44,934
- Oh, Joanna!
- What's happened?

787
01:25:45,267 --> 01:25:49,351
Colonel Miller and his men...
they're not Polish, they're Germans!

788
01:25:49,684 --> 01:25:51,184
They want to kidnap Churchill.

789
01:25:51,517 --> 01:25:56,643
They've got the villagers.
We must tell the Rangers!

790
01:25:56,975 --> 01:25:58,176
- Does anybody else know?
- No.

791
01:25:58,434 --> 01:26:00,309
I'll get my car keys.

792
01:26:37,268 --> 01:26:39,810
- What kept you?
- I killed Arthur.

793
01:26:40,143 --> 01:26:44,226
Don't fret. They'll think I did it.
Did you tell anybody about it?

794
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:49,602
- He said you're a traitor? Are you?
- I don't betray what I believe in.

795
01:26:49,936 --> 01:26:53,352
Your bloody Germans
have locked everyone in the church.

796
01:26:53,685 --> 01:26:55,560
They're going to kill Churchill.

797
01:26:55,894 --> 01:26:57,352
Traitor!

798
01:26:57,685 --> 01:27:01,102
But Pamela's gone for the Rangers!

799
01:27:01,436 --> 01:27:04,977
- Jesus!
- Don't try and run!

800
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:09,311
Run away?
That would be sensible.

801
01:27:09,644 --> 01:27:11,936
Don't you know me better than that?

802
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,478
Do you think I could leave them
in the lurch?

803
01:27:17,102 --> 01:27:21,770
I wrote you a letter. It's not much.
Here it is, for what it's worth.

804
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:26,603
It's on the table,
if you're interested.

805
01:27:44,062 --> 01:27:47,895
Eagle, this is Albatross.

806
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:49,728
Eagle, this is Albatross.

807
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:16,979
Pamela knows everything. She's gone
to Meltham House, for the Rangers.

808
01:28:17,312 --> 01:28:19,896
I shot at her.
I'm sure I hit her.

809
01:28:21,812 --> 01:28:23,979
No matter what the reason,

810
01:28:26,687 --> 01:28:29,438
no matter how deeply felt the cause,

811
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:32,604
you lived with us, Joanna.

812
01:28:34,271 --> 01:28:37,229
You accepted our admiration,

813
01:28:37,563 --> 01:28:41,563
our kindness... and our trust.

814
01:28:41,896 --> 01:28:46,979
May God grant you time
to relive this moment in shame!

815
01:29:09,397 --> 01:29:12,105
Are you able to communicate
with the E-boat?

816
01:29:15,356 --> 01:29:17,688
Tell them to go
to Position One immediately.

817
01:29:18,813 --> 01:29:21,772
This really is a beautiful spot,
you know.

818
01:29:23,064 --> 01:29:24,230
Yes.

819
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:37,023
I understand, Mrs. Grey.

820
01:29:37,356 --> 01:29:41,814
No matter how you feel about the British,
you must hate to leave here.

821
01:29:42,148 --> 01:29:44,814
That's just it, Colonel.

822
01:29:45,148 --> 01:29:49,689
Until this moment,
in spite of all I've set in motion,

823
01:29:50,023 --> 01:29:53,439
I never actually believed
I'd have to go.

824
01:30:06,231 --> 01:30:10,690
- What the hell's goin' on, Haley?
- Don't know. The Colonel said, "Wait."

825
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,482
Your girl's okay, Clark.
She's in hospital.

826
01:30:15,815 --> 01:30:18,273
She took a bullet from some
double-crossing bitch named Grey.

827
01:30:18,607 --> 01:30:19,732
Enemy agent.

828
01:30:20,065 --> 01:30:23,690
Those Poles you met are Krauts.
They're hereto kill Churchill.

829
01:30:24,024 --> 01:30:28,315
Now, listen up.
Churchill just left King's Lynn.

830
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:30,523
Have you notified the War Office?

831
01:30:30,857 --> 01:30:35,191
That'll take too long.

832
01:30:35,523 --> 01:30:38,441
I'm gonna nail those Krauts myself,
and I've got the men to do it.

833
01:30:38,774 --> 01:30:41,274
"Action this day."
That's Churchill's motto.

834
01:30:41,607 --> 01:30:42,941
We should notify-

835
01:30:43,274 --> 01:30:45,232
Go and head off Churchill.

836
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:48,650
If you don't notify the War Office,
I will, sir.

837
01:30:51,107 --> 01:30:54,608
Moss, get a hold of the War Office.
Top priority.

838
01:30:54,941 --> 01:30:58,024
If anything happens to Churchill
because you're late...

839
01:30:59,107 --> 01:31:01,524
this country will swing you
from Big Ben.

840
01:31:07,942 --> 01:31:09,858
Cancel that call, Moss.

841
01:31:27,442 --> 01:31:30,275
- Put the windshield down, Haley.
- Yes, sir!

842
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,734
- Give me a handful of those grenades.
- Yes, sir.

843
01:31:39,734 --> 01:31:40,859
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir.

844
01:31:41,192 --> 01:31:43,275
- How're you doin'?
- Fine, sir.

845
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,068
- Where are you from?
- Omaha, sir.

846
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,651
By this time next year,

847
01:31:51,984 --> 01:31:56,234
pigeons are gonna be crappin'
on statues of you all over Nebraska!

848
01:31:59,692 --> 01:32:02,026
All right.

849
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,817
Move ahead.

850
01:32:06,193 --> 01:32:08,443
Okay!

851
01:32:59,444 --> 01:33:03,361
- Did you spot anything, sir?
- No. Hang on to this, Lieutenant.

852
01:33:03,694 --> 01:33:07,235
I think I can take this place
without firing a single round.

853
01:33:07,569 --> 01:33:10,527
- Yes, sir.
- Get out, Haley!

854
01:33:23,236 --> 01:33:26,070
Well, this looks like it.

855
01:34:16,029 --> 01:34:19,862
This is Colonel Clarence E Pitts,
United States Army!

856
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:25,820
You are surrounded.
Send out your Commanding Officer!

857
01:34:36,529 --> 01:34:38,613
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

858
01:34:38,947 --> 01:34:41,947
I'll give you five minutes
to lay down your arms

859
01:34:42,279 --> 01:34:44,155
and surrender your hostages.

860
01:34:44,529 --> 01:34:46,780
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

861
01:34:49,446 --> 01:34:51,780
- Where's your Commanding Officer?
- Yes.

862
01:34:52,947 --> 01:34:54,821
Are you makin' fun of me, soldier?

863
01:34:56,947 --> 01:34:59,030
Well, goddamn it!

864
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,030
Goddamn Krauts think they're gonna kick me
around, they've got another think coming.

865
01:35:14,364 --> 01:35:16,864
I'll blow their asses
right out of that church!

866
01:35:32,031 --> 01:35:34,031
Delta Two, to Mallory.

867
01:35:34,364 --> 01:35:36,822
Where are you, Mallory?

868
01:35:37,156 --> 01:35:38,781
Mallory, where are you?

869
01:35:39,864 --> 01:35:41,281
This is Mallory.
We're all set.

870
01:35:41,614 --> 01:35:43,614
Stand by.
Becker, you out there?

871
01:35:43,948 --> 01:35:45,906
Ready, Colonel.

872
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:49,448
Stand by.
We're gonna move in!

873
01:35:51,031 --> 01:35:53,989
Come on, we're movin' out!

874
01:36:01,406 --> 01:36:05,281
Shouldn't we look the place over?

875
01:36:05,615 --> 01:36:08,573
And have men shot
to find out somethin' I already know?

876
01:36:08,907 --> 01:36:13,240
There are a lot of places for an ambush,
sir. Plus, there's the civilians.

877
01:36:13,573 --> 01:36:18,740
You question one more of my orders,
and I'm gonna bust you to Private!

878
01:36:19,074 --> 01:36:20,990
Yes, sir.

879
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:30,449
Go, Beck! Go, Mallory!

880
01:37:19,824 --> 01:37:23,450
Get out!
Come on, get down!

881
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,576
Son of a bitch!

882
01:38:05,201 --> 01:38:07,451
Get a missile for the bazooka.

883
01:38:22,534 --> 01:38:25,077
- Beck! Come in, Beck!
- Beck here.

884
01:38:25,409 --> 01:38:28,910
We're gettin' fire from all round.

885
01:38:29,243 --> 01:38:32,618
There are four dead
and we're pinned down.

886
01:38:32,952 --> 01:38:33,952
Four dead?

887
01:38:34,243 --> 01:38:38,202
This is Frazier, Colonel.
We got three dead.

888
01:38:38,535 --> 01:38:43,327
Pull yourself together. Regroup.
Do something, Frazier!

889
01:38:43,661 --> 01:38:47,702
Regroup?
That dumb son of a bitch!

890
01:38:48,035 --> 01:38:52,285
This is Mallory.
I got that truck with the bazooka.

891
01:38:52,619 --> 01:38:56,118
What do they want, a medal?

892
01:38:58,327 --> 01:39:00,452
Jake!

893
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:06,454
Frazier radioed this in, sir.

894
01:40:09,995 --> 01:40:12,828
Oh, Holy Jesus!

895
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:16,954
- Did you get the Colonel?
- No, sir.

896
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:22,663
I've got the whole outfit ready to move.

897
01:40:25,537 --> 01:40:29,996
Colonel Pitts is a man
of limited combat experience.

898
01:40:30,329 --> 01:40:32,871
- Apparently no longer.
- Nope

899
01:40:33,205 --> 01:40:37,330
Major Corcoran here.
We have an incident.

900
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,330
I'm going to go up on the second floor
to find out where we are.

901
01:40:49,664 --> 01:40:53,038
Give me those binoculars.
Fix that tire.

902
01:40:58,205 --> 01:41:02,080
God, this is where that bitch Grey lives!
Bring that gun!

903
01:41:18,664 --> 01:41:20,664
Mrs. Grey!

904
01:41:25,622 --> 01:41:27,622
Mrs. Grey!

905
01:41:42,914 --> 01:41:44,498
Sir...

906
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,539
Mrs. Grey!

907
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:20,666
Holy shit!

908
01:42:55,749 --> 01:42:58,333
I have a suggestion, Herr Oberst.

909
01:42:58,666 --> 01:43:01,749
- Yes, Brandt?
- We should leave immediately.

910
01:43:02,083 --> 01:43:03,458
Yes, Brandt.

911
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:21,375
Get back to the church!

912
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:26,875
Cover!

913
01:44:25,627 --> 01:44:29,293
I'll let you know when I need you,
Father.

914
01:44:29,627 --> 01:44:32,377
Get to your positions!

915
01:45:30,628 --> 01:45:33,003
I think we're about to take up
permanent residence here.

916
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:55,379
Another white flag has arrived.

917
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,796
Unfortunately, this officer
seems to know his business.

918
01:45:59,128 --> 01:46:04,253
Colonel, my one consolation is that,
thanks to my sister, your plot has failed.

919
01:46:04,587 --> 01:46:06,087
Really?

920
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:11,837
It failed because one of my men died
saving that little girl.

921
01:46:20,963 --> 01:46:24,254
Father, you had betterjoin your flock.

922
01:46:56,755 --> 01:47:02,047
- Captain Clark, what can I do for you?
- Surrender.

923
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:05,588
Surrender?

924
01:47:11,214 --> 01:47:13,630
Mr. Churchill is safe and under guard.

925
01:47:13,964 --> 01:47:18,713
Mrs. Grey is dead,
and her radio has been confiscated.

926
01:47:20,339 --> 01:47:22,255
It's all over, Colonel.

927
01:47:23,547 --> 01:47:25,214
I have hostages.

928
01:47:26,381 --> 01:47:30,798
Well, I can't see you bringin' them out,
women and children in front of you.

929
01:47:32,172 --> 01:47:33,464
No.

930
01:47:37,214 --> 01:47:39,006
Let the villagers go, Altmann.

931
01:47:39,339 --> 01:47:42,173
Father, your people, please.

932
01:48:07,632 --> 01:48:12,215
Colonel, I understand none of this,
and I don't wish you well,

933
01:48:12,548 --> 01:48:15,840
but I'm grateful for the life of my child.

934
01:48:16,173 --> 01:48:18,090
So am I.

935
01:48:25,423 --> 01:48:28,548
Don't forget, Father...
"The last shall be first."

936
01:48:28,882 --> 01:48:31,590
You bastard!

937
01:48:41,383 --> 01:48:43,466
Let me go!

938
01:48:45,216 --> 01:48:49,299
Father! Father,
I've got to get you out of here!

939
01:48:49,633 --> 01:48:52,758
Pamela's all right.
She's in the hospital.

940
01:48:53,091 --> 01:48:56,132
- Father!
- Yes.

941
01:49:02,967 --> 01:49:05,633
Good-bye, Captain Clark.

942
01:49:05,967 --> 01:49:11,508
Colonel, there's no such thing
as death with honour, just death.

943
01:49:11,841 --> 01:49:15,133
I have no intention of dying now,

944
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:19,716
but if I'm going to,
allow me to choose where and how.

945
01:49:27,592 --> 01:49:32,467
- What are you doing?
- Getting the keys to his car.

946
01:49:36,133 --> 01:49:38,175
How did you get in here?

947
01:49:43,092 --> 01:49:44,884
There's a tunnel.

948
01:49:45,217 --> 01:49:50,467
It's an ancient escape route
that leads up to the vicarage.

949
01:49:51,759 --> 01:49:53,759
The car is parked at the end of it.

950
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,051
Mr. Devlin,

951
01:50:01,385 --> 01:50:03,385
you are an extraordinary man.

952
01:50:07,218 --> 01:50:10,510
Colonel Steiner, you are
an extraordinary judge of character.

953
01:50:15,218 --> 01:50:17,218
There is a way out now.

954
01:50:21,426 --> 01:50:23,843
It is still possible for us
to capture Churchill.

955
01:50:24,176 --> 01:50:27,635
Not us, Herr Oberst, you.

956
01:50:27,969 --> 01:50:30,301
If we all attempt to leave,
we will fail.

957
01:50:30,635 --> 01:50:32,510
Very probably.

958
01:50:32,843 --> 01:50:35,885
Do you have a suggestion, Brandt?

959
01:50:36,219 --> 01:50:41,260
You go, and we stay
and hold this place as long as possible.

960
01:50:55,344 --> 01:50:59,260
Shall we say covering fire
in about 30 seconds, Herr Oberst?

961
01:51:09,719 --> 01:51:11,344
Yes.

962
01:51:12,469 --> 01:51:15,386
Hans, you come with me.

963
01:51:33,178 --> 01:51:37,053
It has been a privilege
to serve with you.

964
01:53:17,597 --> 01:53:18,847
Go!

965
01:54:16,391 --> 01:54:18,515
One-two-three, go!

966
01:55:08,933 --> 01:55:12,392
We can stay one step ahead
if the radio is still inside.

967
01:55:12,724 --> 01:55:15,308
If the E-boat is still outside.

968
01:55:16,642 --> 01:55:18,475
It's out there.

969
01:55:37,017 --> 01:55:38,850
I love you.

970
01:55:39,184 --> 01:55:41,392
That doesn't mean
I like what you've done

971
01:55:41,725 --> 01:55:44,684
or what I've done,
or even understand it.

972
01:55:46,393 --> 01:55:50,059
I only know I couldn't have lived
with myself if I let you die.

973
01:55:51,684 --> 01:55:55,850
- Did you read my letter?
- Yes.

974
01:56:06,351 --> 01:56:09,601
Well done, Captain.
Congratulations.

975
01:56:09,935 --> 01:56:12,226
There are three survivors, sir...

976
01:56:12,559 --> 01:56:17,893
Steiner, Devlin, and one German
who we know is badly wounded.

977
01:56:18,226 --> 01:56:20,977
With your permission, sir,
I'll pick 'em up.

978
01:56:53,852 --> 01:56:56,352
I can't stay for long.
The tide.

979
01:56:56,686 --> 01:56:59,602
- Get on board.
- I'm not Ieavin'.

980
01:56:59,936 --> 01:57:02,894
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm stayin' here.

981
01:57:08,811 --> 01:57:10,894
Hans"

982
01:57:15,978 --> 01:57:18,103
Take Herr Hauptmann aboard.

983
01:57:19,561 --> 01:57:21,061
Herr Hauptmann...

984
01:57:23,811 --> 01:57:28,144
- I will not leave without you.
- Get on board, Hans.

985
01:57:28,478 --> 01:57:31,520
I will not.
I'm coming with you.

986
01:57:33,561 --> 01:57:36,478
How long have we
known each other?

987
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,478
Since the day you kicked me
out of the plane at Narvik.

988
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:42,062
Three years.

989
01:57:44,853 --> 01:57:46,812
Hauptmann Ritter von Neustadt...

990
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:53,478
in all that time, you have never once
disobeyed an order of mine.

991
01:57:53,770 --> 01:57:56,645
And I will not let you start now.

992
01:57:58,229 --> 01:57:59,770
Herr Oberst.

993
01:58:15,562 --> 01:58:19,062
Take the boat offshore
and stay there as long as possible.

994
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:26,063
- He'll be heavily guarded.
- Yes.

995
01:58:26,396 --> 01:58:28,562
- You don't even know where he is.
- That's right.

996
01:58:28,896 --> 01:58:30,479
You're still going after him?

997
01:58:31,813 --> 01:58:37,021
The time has come, Mr. Devlin,
when I no longer control events.

998
01:58:37,355 --> 01:58:39,188
They control me.

999
01:58:39,562 --> 01:58:42,021
Good-bye, Mr. Devlin.

1000
01:58:44,355 --> 01:58:46,063
You're a lovely fellow, Colonel.

1001
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:54,730
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1002
01:58:55,063 --> 01:58:59,021
I already have.
I hope I haven't lost it in the finding.

1003
01:59:40,648 --> 01:59:43,022
Herr Oberst.

1004
01:59:43,356 --> 01:59:45,481
A message from Albatross.

1005
01:59:45,773 --> 01:59:48,773
- It, uh...
- Read it.

1006
01:59:49,107 --> 01:59:50,356
It's garbled.

1007
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:52,250
- We could have misunderstood.
- Please.

1008
01:59:54,398 --> 01:59:59,648
"One wounded fledgling left. Return nest."
Then it's unintelligible.

1009
02:00:01,065 --> 02:00:03,898
"No tide at present... for..."

1010
02:00:04,232 --> 02:00:07,190
Then it's unintelligible again.
Uh...

1011
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:13,023
"God save..."
That's all they could understand, sir.

1012
02:00:28,983 --> 02:00:31,148
Get out of here, Karl.
Back to Berlin.

1013
02:00:31,482 --> 02:00:35,899
By plane, car, anything you can
commandeer with my authorization.

1014
02:00:36,232 --> 02:00:38,691
You have a wife and children, huh?

1015
02:00:39,983 --> 02:00:42,316
I was measured
for my casket months ago.

1016
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:49,816
- Do you understand me, Karl?
- I-I think so, sir.

1017
02:00:50,149 --> 02:00:52,816
You were following my orders.
You had no choice.

1018
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:56,732
The Admiral's a decent man.
He'll understand.

1019
02:00:58,983 --> 02:01:01,149
Good-bye, Karl.

1020
02:01:01,483 --> 02:01:02,483
Go!

1021
02:01:02,733 --> 02:01:05,483
- But"
- Go.

1022
02:02:12,609 --> 02:02:15,609
We've checked the beach road.
Haven't seen a thing.

1023
02:02:15,943 --> 02:02:18,485
Beck here.

1024
02:02:18,818 --> 02:02:21,527
We've checked the beach road.
Not a damn thing.

1025
02:02:21,859 --> 02:02:24,402
Run it again.
Check for turn-offs.

1026
02:02:24,734 --> 02:02:27,652
- Understood.
- Come in, Wilson.

1027
02:02:27,985 --> 02:02:30,485
Moving west.

1028
02:02:30,819 --> 02:02:33,235
Results... negative.

1029
02:02:33,568 --> 02:02:38,819
Work back towards five and four.
Frazier, this is Delta Two.

1030
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:43,318
Frazier here, sir.
Negative on anything.

1031
02:02:43,652 --> 02:02:45,360
Okay, Frazier.

1032
02:02:45,694 --> 02:02:50,610
The convoy is being moved
to original destination.

1033
02:02:50,944 --> 02:02:54,568
- Stay off the air until I call.
- Frazier. Out.

1034
02:03:01,111 --> 02:03:03,486
Frazier, this is Delta Two.

1035
02:03:06,653 --> 02:03:09,277
Come in, Frazier.

1036
02:03:09,611 --> 02:03:12,403
Frazier, this is Delta Two.

1037
02:03:14,736 --> 02:03:16,861
Frazier, this is Delta Two.

1038
02:03:17,194 --> 02:03:18,319
Frazier.

1039
02:03:18,653 --> 02:03:22,069
New position, Frazier.
Cover the mouth of Estuary One.

1040
02:03:24,861 --> 02:03:26,945
- Will do.
- Delta Two. Out.

1041
02:03:59,195 --> 02:04:00,946
This looks like the place.

1042
02:04:19,862 --> 02:04:23,529
- There's somebody in there.
- Let's take it.

1043
02:04:23,862 --> 02:04:29,488
No way. The door's open.
We'll let the dogs do it.

1044
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:18,155
I told you those dogs
are no damn good!

1045
02:05:23,322 --> 02:05:26,906
Your pardon, Herr Reichsfijhrer.
Message received from Albatross.

1046
02:05:28,698 --> 02:05:30,489
It's fragmentary.

1047
02:05:34,656 --> 02:05:37,406
Get me Hauptsturmführer Fleischer,
in Cherbourg.

1048
02:05:37,739 --> 02:05:39,781
Haw oh“.!

1049
02:06:00,573 --> 02:06:04,532
Herr Oberst Radl?
You are under arrest.

1050
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:08,699
May I be permitted
to know the charge?

1051
02:06:09,031 --> 02:06:12,323
Exceeding your orders
to the point of treason to the State.

1052
02:06:13,824 --> 02:06:15,281
Oh.

1053
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:21,535
Now, put your men round there.
Okay, Moss, over there.

1054
02:08:35,035 --> 02:08:38,077
- Put two men on the perimeter!
- Right, sir.

1055
02:08:55,577 --> 02:08:58,828
Check back here in five minutes.
Let's move out.

1056
02:09:19,161 --> 02:09:21,703
- Whisky?
- No, I won't, thanks.

1057
02:09:23,744 --> 02:09:27,577
Well, he's settled
with his cigars and brandy.

1058
02:09:53,453 --> 02:09:56,079
There's some question as to the identity
of an American officer

1059
02:09:56,412 --> 02:09:57,870
who proceeded the convoy to here.

1060
02:09:58,204 --> 02:10:00,037
None of my men led the convoy.

1061
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:03,954
One moment, please.
Captain Clark.

1062
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:12,704
Captain Clark speaking.

1063
02:10:14,829 --> 02:10:15,996
You're what?

1064
02:10:17,745 --> 02:10:19,787
What do you mean,
he's unconscious?

1065
02:10:21,329 --> 02:10:23,287
Hisjeep is missing?

1066
02:10:27,871 --> 02:10:30,496
Jesus God. He's here.

1067
02:10:55,455 --> 02:10:57,255
Cover the front of the building.
Through here!

1068
02:10:57,414 --> 02:10:59,330
The terrace!
Prime Minister!

1069
02:11:16,831 --> 02:11:18,247
Poor sod.

1070
02:11:19,789 --> 02:11:22,123
No one will ever know what he did.

1071
02:11:23,206 --> 02:11:27,706
Never know? Are you crazy?
That's Winston Churchill lying there!

1072
02:11:29,622 --> 02:11:31,164
No, Captain.

1073
02:11:33,622 --> 02:11:36,664
That is one George Fowler
lying there.

1074
02:11:37,747 --> 02:11:42,498
He's a variety artist of a sort,
and a very brave man.

1075
02:11:43,706 --> 02:11:47,415
Incredible. He knew
this sort of thing could happen.

1076
02:11:47,748 --> 02:11:51,248
He didn't even call out.
He played it to the end.

1077
02:11:54,665 --> 02:11:56,164
Where is Mr. Churchill?

1078
02:11:57,331 --> 02:12:00,331
Well, I suppose you'll read about it
in the papers tomorrow.

1079
02:12:00,665 --> 02:12:05,832
At the moment, he's in Persia,
with your president and Marshal Stalin.

1080
02:12:06,165 --> 02:12:10,207
Tehran, Captain.
That's where the reality is.

1081
02:12:10,581 --> 02:12:14,999
This... This never happened.

1082
02:12:16,416 --> 02:12:18,165
It did not occur, Major.

1083
02:12:19,748 --> 02:12:21,249
Right.

1084
02:12:27,832 --> 02:12:29,749
Molly, my love,

1085
02:12:30,082 --> 02:12:32,666
as a great man once said,

1086
02:12:32,999 --> 02:12:37,999
"I have suffered a sea-change,
and nothing can be the same again."

1087
02:12:39,082 --> 02:12:42,708
I came here to Norfolk to do a job,
not to fall in love.

1088
02:12:43,041 --> 02:12:47,541
By now, you'll know the worst of me.
Try not to think it.

1089
02:12:47,874 --> 02:12:51,250
To leave you is punishment enough.

1090
02:12:51,582 --> 02:12:53,499
But it will not end here.

1091
02:12:53,833 --> 02:12:59,417
For, as they say in Ireland,
"We have known the days." Liam.
