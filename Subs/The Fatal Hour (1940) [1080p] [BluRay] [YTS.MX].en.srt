1
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:44,450
-Hello, Mike.

2
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,438
What's new?

3
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:47,937
Got anything for the
afternoon edition?

4
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:50,005
-No, nothing new.

5
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,433
-Tell our king his
nemesis is out here.

6
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:54,740
-Now miss Logan, maybe you'd
better drop back a little

7
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,729
later.

8
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,025
Capt. Street's tied up
on a very important case.

9
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:02,352
That's a riot.

10
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,909
-An important case, huh?

11
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,479
So
the boys get a fast call.

12
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,147
Fairly wreck the car and
when they get down there,

13
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:08,415
it's just another
family quarrel.

14
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:10,333
-Hello Bill.

15
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,173
How many
times have I told

16
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,251
you not to bust into my office?

17
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:14,020
If I can you
can three hours

18
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,709
from noon.

19
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,697
-Of course, you know miss
Bobbie Logan of the Herald.

20
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:19,134
Little gal gets all the medals
for digging up the bodies.

21
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,432
Check for those
fingerprints, will you?

22
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,282
-Right.

23
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,231
Well, goodbye.

24
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,077
-Polite policeman?

25
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:26,776
-Ah.

26
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,115
-Ah, c'mon, Bill,
give me a story.

27
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,284
You know I've got
to have something

28
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:30,333
for the afternoon edition.

29
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,111
-Everything is
peaceful and quiet.

30
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,498
I have nothing for the
afternoon edition, now scram.

31
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:37,185
-Captain, the coroner phoned.

32
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:40,122
They've just taken Dan
Grady to the morgue.

33
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:42,550
They fished him out of
the bay about an hour ago.

34
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,249
Murdered.

35
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,642
-Oh, he's going to take
this pretty hard, Mike.

36
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,011
-Sure.

37
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:03,488
Him and Dan was
just like brothers.

38
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,187
-Yes, I know.

39
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:09,492
-What makes you think they
tried to hide his body, Doc?

40
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:11,320
-Well, in the first place,
you know where it was found.

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,927
Washed ashore down the bay.

42
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,856
Lungs were collapsed.

43
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:18,982
That means the body was under
water pressure for some time.

44
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:21,150
This was tied around the ankles.

45
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,977
And there were deep bruises.

46
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,284
-Tied a weight on him
and threw him overboard.

47
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:27,293
-That's right, Bill.

48
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,301
After the bullets
had done their work.

49
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:30,120
-Yeah.

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,088
Did you get them
over to ballistics?

51
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:32,877
-Mhm.

52
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,036
Here's the clothes he had on.

53
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:34,735
Take a look.

54
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,048
-Seaman's outfit.

55
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:43,756
Andy, check these
clothes and see

56
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,883
if you can find out
where he bought them.

57
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:52,717
Thanks a lot, Doc, I'll check
with you later about Dan.

58
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:53,416
-Bye Bill.

59
00:03:57,781 --> 00:04:00,708
-It hits the whole
department with a jolt, Bill.

60
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,116
-Hit me a little
harder than the rest.

61
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,114
Dan and I were together as kids.

62
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:08,820
Took our training together
down to the same beat.

63
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,157
-Yes, I know.

64
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:13,155
-You say he was on
a smuggling detail.

65
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:14,434
-Yes.

66
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,352
-That aught to lead
us to something.

67
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:19,188
-Nothing unless he was
following a hot trail.

68
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,647
You know Grady.

69
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,714
He always preferred to
work lone wolf on a case.

70
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:25,303
-Well, it's in my
department now, Chief.

71
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:26,751
It's homicide.

72
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,759
-Yes, and you will have
command of every resource

73
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,937
of the department.

74
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,325
-I may need it.

75
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,424
Because I'm going
to find out who

76
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:34,982
killed Grady if it's
the last thing I do.

77
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,331
-I know you will, Bill.

78
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:37,430
And good luck.

79
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,129
-Thanks.

80
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:57,219
-Gee, Bill, I'm sorry.

81
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:58,718
I wish I could help.

82
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,115
-Thanks, Bobbie.

83
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:02,893
Funny, but somehow,
I can't realize it.

84
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,209
-Does his wife know?

85
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:07,908
-Molly?

86
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,116
No, not yet.

87
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:13,013
Poor kid.

88
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,490
Say, you can help me
with that if you want to.

89
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,127
-Of course, anything.

90
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:23,372
-Go on out to Molly's and break
it to her as easy as you can.

91
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:25,610
-She doesn't know me very well.

92
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,087
You're the one to tell her.

93
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,855
-Well, it's a woman's job.

94
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:30,554
-OK, Bill.

95
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:46,218
-I came just as soon
as I heard the news.

96
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:47,327
-Am I glad, Wong.

97
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,235
I sure can use you.

98
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,002
Unfortunately, I can't call you
in on this case, officially.

99
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,070
I'm more or less
doing it on my own.

100
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,067
-I'll do everything
I can to help.

101
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,984
Dan Grady was my friend too.

102
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,753
-Thanks.

103
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:01,992
You know what it means to me.

104
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:04,669
-Not too fast with you thanks.

105
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:06,996
You know, the only reason
I've been useful in the past

106
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:10,543
was because in each case,
the Orient was involved.

107
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:13,210
-But Dan Grady was assigned
to the smuggling detail.

108
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,595
And smuggling in San
Francisco means the Oriental.

109
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:19,194
Let's have a look at his office.

110
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:19,893
-Go ahead.

111
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:24,778
-Wife and kid.

112
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:33,169
-You say he was working
on a smuggling detail.

113
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,667
-Yes, sort of a
roving commission.

114
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,215
The reason they
gave it to Dan was

115
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,692
because he was born and
raised here in San Francisco.

116
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,549
He knew every nook and cranny.

117
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,757
-Seaman's clothes
would indicate that he

118
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:47,454
was working on something
at the waterfront.

119
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,551
-Yeah, but what?

120
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:53,858
-Woah, look here.

121
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:54,607
What is that?

122
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,058
-Why, that's a rare
piece of emerald jade,

123
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:06,075
as fine a specimen
as I've ever seen,

124
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:09,351
Carved in the fashion
of the Ming Dynasty.

125
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,670
Why, the art of that
carving has been

126
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,859
lost for hundreds of years.

127
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:14,236
This piece is worth two
or three thousand dollars.

128
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:16,174
-Really?

129
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:19,681
Dan was sure working
on something hot.

130
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,269
-Probably that's
why he was killed.

131
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:32,877
-Yes, I have seen many similar
in the past three months.

132
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,504
-From the captured provinces.

133
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:37,732
-Even so.

134
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:40,938
From the ruined
temple of Lau Jade.

135
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:43,905
Is it not so?

136
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:49,519
Torn from their
settings by alien hands.

137
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,995
Even young China would not use
such methods to win its wars.

138
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,378
Where did you obtain this?

139
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,206
-It was in the
drawer of the desk

140
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:04,823
of the policeman who was killed.

141
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,721
-A policeman?

142
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,080
-A good man.

143
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,957
Can you help me?

144
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,154
-A store called Belden's
is on Market Street

145
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:19,089
and there, a wise man
could become more wise.

146
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:34,962
-How do you do?
-I'm Mr. Belden.

147
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:36,201
Is there something
I can do for you?

148
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,159
-I'd like an appraisal
on this piece.

149
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,858
-Why certainly.

150
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,032
-Hm.

151
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,699
A most unusual piece.

152
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,995
The coloring is magnificent.

153
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:53,423
But I'm afraid I can't
appraise it's real value.

154
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:55,111
-But I understood
you specialized

155
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:58,448
in oriental jewelry
and art objects.

156
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,216
Only imitation.

157
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:03,762
We haven't a piece of jewelry
in the house worth over $50.

158
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,050
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong place.

159
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,979
-So it would seem.

160
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,309
-Morning, Dad.

161
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:24,370
-I suggest you try
Harrington's over on Kearny.

162
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,099
They handle that
type of merchandise.

163
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,327
-Thank you for your time.

164
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:28,176
-Not at all.

165
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,635
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

166
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,889
-Yeah, Chief, that's
the guy, all right.

167
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,457
I'd know that face any place.

168
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:51,952
Why that mustache-- even
the checkered tie-- yeah,

169
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:53,810
that's him.

170
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,959
-Checkered tie, huh?

171
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,147
-Yeah.

172
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:57,396
-Where'd you see him?

173
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,084
-On the bus going uptown.

174
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:00,073
-What time was it?

175
00:10:00,073 --> 00:10:01,731
-12 o'clock, noon.

176
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,110
-12 o'clock, noon huh?

177
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,809
Ya don't say.

178
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:04,509
-Yeah.

179
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:06,626
-At that time, he'd been
lying dead for three

180
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:08,205
hours in the morgue.

181
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,144
-Yeah?

182
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,053
-Yeah.

183
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:12,350
-Why, I'd have sworn on a stack
of Bibles that was the guy.

184
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,789
-Sure, I know Mr. Juniper.

185
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,487
We all make mistakes
sometimes, but thanks

186
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:16,286
for coming in anyway.

187
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,604
-Oh, not at all,
Inspector, not at all.

188
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:20,212
Say, maybe it was
the guy's double.

189
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:20,911
-Yeah.

190
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,350
-You know, they say
every guy's got a double.

191
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,640
-Sure.

192
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,559
-Even me.

193
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,668
-Sure.

194
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:25,447
-Even you.

195
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,146
-Yeah, sure.

196
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,698
Mike, get Bobbie
Logan on the phone.

197
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:36,425
-Yes, sir.

198
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:39,872
-Market 6-400.

199
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,420
Hello
Bobbie, I was just

200
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,879
trying to get you on the phone.

201
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,017
-Oh, are we going some place?

202
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:46,045
Yeah, you're going some place,

203
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,743
if you ever pull a bright
idea like that again.

204
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:48,902
-Well, what's the
matter with that?

205
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,301
Somebody might be able
to give you a lead.

206
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:52,239
-Somebody might be
able to give me a lead.

207
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,857
I've had every crank in
San Francisco in here

208
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:54,636
this afternoon.

209
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:56,934
-Yeah.

210
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:57,963
-Logan doesn't answer.

211
00:10:57,963 --> 00:10:59,561
Where do you think I
aught to look for her.

212
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:01,179
Try my office.

213
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,607
-Huh?

214
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:04,806
-Every one of them
has see Dan Grady

215
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:07,103
in five different sections
of the city at the same time.

216
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:07,802
-Well, but--

217
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:08,532
-But nothing.

218
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:10,130
Did you see that guy that
just went out of here?

219
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:10,829
-Yes.

220
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,677
-He was on the bus
today at noon with Dan.

221
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:13,377
-Well, that's silly.

222
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:14,446
Of course it's silly.

223
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:16,224
But I've had to
talk to those goofs.

224
00:11:16,224 --> 00:11:18,781
That's what your idea has done,
wasted my whole afternoon.

225
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,119
-Yeah, Mike?

226
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:24,115
-A gentleman out here says
he saw Detective Grady.

227
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,634
What?

228
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:27,312
Miss Logan will interview him.

229
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,221
Well, did you hear it?

230
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,220
Just faintly.

231
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,479
-Go on, he's your witness.

232
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,731
-Are you Mr. Lyons?

233
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,431
-Yes.

234
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,279
-Well, I'm Miss
Logan of the Herald.

235
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,067
I put that picture in the paper.

236
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:42,916
-Oh, how do you do?

237
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,523
Well, I saw the man last night.

238
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:46,392
-Are you sure?

239
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:47,471
-Certainly.

240
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,788
We talked for quite a while in
the bar at the Club Neptune.

241
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,606
-Good afternoon, Miss Logan.

242
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,434
I came in answer to
your advertisement.

243
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:56,182
Oh,
now look, Mr. Wong.

244
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,955
-Now give me the
details and talk fast.

245
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,773
-Oh hello, Wong.

246
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:05,852
Did you get any information?

247
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:07,550
-I called on an
old friend of mine

248
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,868
in Chinatown who advised
me to investigate

249
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:12,145
Belden's store on Market street.

250
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:12,935
-Belden's?

251
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,843
-You know, the jewelry shop.

252
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:15,542
-Oh, sure.

253
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,571
I'll put a couple of men on it.

254
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,519
-No, I think I'd
leave things the way

255
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,097
they are for the time being.

256
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,396
Bill, see our guy.

257
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:22,095
-Now who?

258
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,043
-This man did see Dan Grady--

259
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,721
-Now look, Bobbie, we've
been all through that.

260
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,740
-But this man is positive.

261
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,618
-All right, if he's
so positive, what

262
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:30,157
was he wearing when you saw him?

263
00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:32,414
-Well, sort of like a sailor.

264
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:35,501
You know, pea jacket,
striped sweater,

265
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:39,537
he had on dungarees, pink
cap with black patent leather

266
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,055
visor.

267
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:42,234
-Where'd you see him?

268
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,832
-At the Club Neptune.

269
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:46,450
He was sitting at the
bar having a drink.

270
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,788
-What time was that?

271
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:50,016
About 8:30, I guess.

272
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,904
-That fits in, doesn't it Wong?

273
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,063
-Yes, it does.

274
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,361
Well,
of course it does.

275
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:55,510
Silly idea, huh?

276
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,178
If it hadn't of been for
that piece in the paper--

277
00:12:57,178 --> 00:12:58,397
Quiet.

278
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:00,295
-You're quite sure
this is the man?

279
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,923
You're absolutley certain
of your identification?

280
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:03,122
-Oh, yes.

281
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:06,529
My drink happened to tip
over and spilt on him

282
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,785
and I apologized and
we got to talking.

283
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:10,854
-And then what happened?

284
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,102
-Well, we talked together
for a couple of minutes

285
00:13:13,102 --> 00:13:16,418
about football,
things like that.

286
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,306
And then I left and went home.

287
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,575
-You left him at
this Club Neptune?

288
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:20,274
-Eh, yes.

289
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:22,432
He was still sitting
there when I left.

290
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:24,720
-Thank you very much,
you've been a great help.

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,634
Is there, uh,
any reward connected with this?

292
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:32,342
-Well, you see, uh, Miss
Logan takes care of that.

293
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:37,536
-Well, I'm sorry Mr. Lyons.

294
00:13:37,536 --> 00:13:39,814
I'm afraid there's no
reward, but-- well, I'd

295
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:42,381
be very glad to mention
your name in my next story

296
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:43,630
if it helps the case.

297
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,578
Uh, did you say your
first name was Homer?

298
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,386
-Uh, yes, Homer.

299
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,083
Lyons.

300
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:50,972
-Thank you.

301
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:53,220
Too bad you haven't
got a picture.

302
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,169
-Oh, I have.

303
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,996
I brought one
along just in case.

304
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:58,704
-Thank you very much, Mr. Lyons.

305
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,573
-Thank you.

306
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,300
Good day.

307
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,197
-Well, Bill Street, do I
get an apology or don't I?

308
00:14:05,197 --> 00:14:06,496
Sure, I'm going to get

309
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,795
the mayor to get you
a key to the city.

310
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:08,973
Mhm, terrific.

311
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,060
The police thank the Herald for
giving them their only clue.

312
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,759
How's that.

313
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,459
Mr. Wong?

314
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:14,468
-Not nearly strong enough.

315
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:16,805
You've earned our
undying gratitude.

316
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:18,723
-Well I hope the information
is of some use to you.

317
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,522
-I'll see you later.

318
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:21,101
-Not me, flatfoot.

319
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,248
Get one of the nurses out
of the receiving hospital.

320
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,296
They don't mind a
pain in the neck.

321
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:27,154
Hey you
think that's a bad idea?

322
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,080
-Well, now, Street,
just what do you

323
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,709
know about the Club Neptune?

324
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,906
-Oh, not much, Wong.

325
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:36,255
We'd better have
dinner together.

326
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:37,793
And I'll take you
down there later.

327
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,721
I want to talk to
this Harry Lockett.

328
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:40,750
-Harry Lockett?

329
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,928
-Yeah, he's the fellow
that owns the Club Neptune.

330
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:43,897
Hardway Harry, they call him.

331
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:44,876
-Hardway.

332
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:45,665
Oh, a gambler?

333
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,364
-Yeah.

334
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:49,291
Gambler, smuggler,
crook, everything.

335
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,615
-Anything new?

336
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:24,315
-No.

337
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:25,733
-How are things upstairs?

338
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,050
-Usual crowd, not much play yet.

339
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,008
-Has Tanya come in yet tonight?

340
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,496
-No.

341
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,494
-I want to see her
when she comes in.

342
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,483
-OK.

343
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:36,482
-Hello there.

344
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:06,301
-Two dry martinies, huh?

345
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:15,681
-Well, uh, don't you
recognize anything?

346
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,579
-What?

347
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,667
-I'll bet you don't even
know what day this is.

348
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,946
-Of course I do.

349
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:21,855
It's Friday.

350
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,602
That's why you insisted upon
coming here for a fish dinner.

351
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:25,861
-Oh, no it isn't.

352
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,378
We came here because
this is an anniversary.

353
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,499
-What is it?

354
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:41,284
-Tanya's here.

355
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,703
But she's got young
Belden with her.

356
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:43,402
-Huh.

357
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,170
She's starting that
over again, eh?

358
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,970
Bring her in here.

359
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,669
-OK.

360
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:50,785
-Listen, Tanya.

361
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:53,861
I've been lying awake nights
planning our future together.

362
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,828
I-- I realize that I
haven't much to offer you.

363
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:59,106
But I'll try awfully
hard to make you happy.

364
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:07,897
-Well, excuse me, Frank.

365
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,365
I think I'd better
go fix my makeup.

366
00:17:09,365 --> 00:17:10,064
-Surely.

367
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:35,788
-What do you want?

368
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,105
-I thought I told you to
keep away from young Belden.

369
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:40,333
-And I told you that
my personal affairs

370
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,281
are none of your business.

371
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:43,400
-What are you trying to do?

372
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,878
Get the old man on our neck?

373
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,666
Keep away from
that boy or I'll--

374
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,084
-Or, what?

375
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:52,450
I guess if I'm good enough to
help handle his smuggled junk,

376
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,878
to run the risks
that he cashes in on,

377
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:55,907
I'm fit company for his son.

378
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,264
-Well, what about a
certain other gentleman?

379
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:06,825
-Frank Belden wants to marry me.

380
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:10,841
So,
he's got a debt, eh?

381
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,140
Wait until his old
man hears that.

382
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,246
-If you open you're mouth to
make trouble for that boy--

383
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:18,923
-So, blow me down, you
have really fallen for him.

384
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:21,150
-Maybe.

385
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,288
Or maybe it's just the
novelty of fining someone

386
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,076
who's decent and on the level.

387
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:30,181
-C'mon, c'mon, have some sense.

388
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,908
Get the boyfriend out of
here and keep him out.

389
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:34,616
We are not in any spot to
invite trouble, girlie.

390
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,817
-I seem to have developed
a headache, Frank.

391
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:54,106
Maybe it was the drink.

392
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:54,945
-Oh, I'm sorry.

393
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,073
Well, maybe some fresh
air will do you good.

394
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:57,992
Shall we take a drive?

395
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:58,691
-Yes.

396
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,577
-Hello, everybody.

397
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:15,553
Well ain't this grand,
we can all be together.

398
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,262
Tommy, give me my usual.

399
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:18,620
You know, the good old double.

400
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:22,346
Why, I know you.

401
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:24,524
You're Logan of the Herald.

402
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:26,372
Don't you remember me?

403
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:29,379
I'm the guy you wrote about
in that automobile accident.

404
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:32,785
You know, in those days,
I was a drinking man.

405
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:35,063
-Aren't you going
to have your dinner?

406
00:19:35,063 --> 00:19:35,762
-What dinner?

407
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,071
-The one you ordered.

408
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:37,980
-I ordered a dinner?

409
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,238
-Why sure you did.

410
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:41,137
-Well, I was just getting--

411
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:42,935
-And I know you can
handle your drinks

412
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:45,902
better if you have
something to eat.

413
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:48,379
-I think you've
got something here.

414
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:50,847
Don't go away.

415
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,983
You know, I always forget to
eat when I go out steppin.

416
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,212
-I'm awfully sorry.

417
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:56,321
-Well, that's all right.

418
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,639
He was just feeling hospitable.

419
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:00,137
Hmm, that's
easy to understand.

420
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:03,214
The Club Neptune feels
the same way, Miss Logan.

421
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:05,951
-Gee wiz, I'm famous.

422
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,959
-Who wouldn't recognize
that pretty face of yours

423
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,835
if they read the Herald?

424
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,663
I'm Harry Lockett.

425
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,191
-I'm very glad to meet you.

426
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:17,748
I've heard a lot about
you and your Club Neptune.

427
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,795
-So it seems, judging
from today's Herald.

428
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:22,084
-Well, you don't sound pleased.

429
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:23,802
-I'm not.

430
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,311
I don't like that publicity.

431
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,190
-You don't?

432
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,397
-No.

433
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,895
How about we chat in my office?

434
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:31,624
-Why not?

435
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,598
-I think I'll take a
look around the back.

436
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:47,977
-All right, I'll see you inside.

437
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:01,463
-You see, Miss Logan,
we, uh, we don't

438
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:03,541
like newspaper
people around here.

439
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,240
-Hmm.

440
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,158
I see your point.

441
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:08,885
You know, if you had
this place sound-proofed,

442
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,053
those poker chips up there
wouldn't make such a wracket.

443
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,569
Just a little
friendly advice.

444
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,268
-Thanks.

445
00:21:15,268 --> 00:21:17,097
And here's some for you.

446
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,414
I wouldn't write any more
stories about the Club Neptune

447
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:20,863
if I were you.

448
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,881
-Are you trying to tell me
what to put in the Herald?

449
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:26,956
-I'm trying to tell you what
you shouldn't put in the Herald.

450
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:30,483
In fact, I'd just as soon
you stayed out of here.

451
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,660
I think you'd be safer.

452
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,078
Sometimes, some people get hurt.

453
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:35,777
-Yeah.

454
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:39,653
Dan Grady got hurt, didn't he?

455
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:44,308
-Hey, you sure stick out your
neck, don't you little girl?

456
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:49,043
-Who is it?

457
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,172
Captain Street.

458
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:56,336
-What are you doing here?

459
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,383
-Mr. Lockett was just
making some suggestions

460
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,842
as to the news
policy of the Herald.

461
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:01,131
-All right, Bobbie.

462
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:02,219
-Well, now look here, Bill--

463
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:04,397
-Come on, come on.

464
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,774
-Hello, Hardway.

465
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:08,733
-Hello, copper.

466
00:22:15,496 --> 00:22:16,495
-Have a drink?

467
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:17,194
-No, thanks.

468
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:24,636
-What's on your mind, Street?

469
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,604
-I suppose you read
about Dan Grady.

470
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:27,973
-Oh, yes, yes.

471
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,311
That's too bad.

472
00:22:29,311 --> 00:22:30,490
I don't think I knew him.

473
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,757
-I thought everybody on
the waterfront knew Grady.

474
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:35,205
He was on the smuggling detail.

475
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,762
It's funny you
didn't run into him.

476
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:39,431
-I resent that, Street.

477
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:40,929
-I resent what
happened to Dan Grady.

478
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:42,218
Quit stalling, Hardway.

479
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:44,675
He was in this place last
night at 8:30, at your bar.

480
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:46,363
-Well, maybe he was.

481
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:48,112
So were a lot of other people.

482
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:49,450
We had a big night last night.

483
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,198
-And nobody saw Dan Grady.

484
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:52,347
-None of my boys did.

485
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:56,203
Because as soon as I saw the
papers, I asked all of them.

486
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:57,751
You can talk to them yourself.

487
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,651
-Maybe I will.

488
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:08,920
-Cigarette?

489
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,619
Over there.

490
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,389
-Oh, don't pay any
attention to me

491
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:09,696
if I seem a little tough, Harry.

492
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:12,873
Dan happened to
be a pal of mine.

493
00:24:12,873 --> 00:24:15,890
His body washed up on
the beach this morning.

494
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,868
Been in the water for 12 hours.

495
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:44,890
-You know, they tied a
weight around his legs

496
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,818
before they tossed
him overboard.

497
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,556
He didn't have a chance.

498
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,903
That's kind of a tough
way to go, isn't it?

499
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:54,140
-Well, Street, they say that
drowning is an easy death.

500
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,008
-But Grady had two slugs
in the back of his neck

501
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,497
before he ever hit that water.

502
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:58,745
That's not so easy, is it?

503
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:07,126
-Well, Street, if there's
anything I can do for you--

504
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:08,975
-Open that door.

505
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,243
Open that door.

506
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,988
-Well, hello, Street.

507
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,766
-How'd you get in there?

508
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:29,273
-The secret stairway
in the haunted house.

509
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:31,351
Secret
stairway, my eye.

510
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:33,849
Those stairs were there
when we bought the place.

511
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:36,556
-But they still serve
a very useful purpose.

512
00:25:36,556 --> 00:25:38,294
-This is Hardway Harry Lockett.

513
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:39,772
Mr. Wong.

514
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,990
-Oh, the Chinese copper.

515
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:47,914
-Precisely, Mr. Lockett.

516
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:51,290
The Chinese copper.

517
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,147
But to return to
our secret stairway,

518
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:57,184
I'm afraid we scared one
of your callers away.

519
00:25:57,184 --> 00:26:00,261
Evidently, he didn't care to
meet my friend, Captain Street.

520
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:03,018
-Seafood as our
specialty, Mr. Wong.

521
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:06,514
That was probably Cap
from the fishing barge.

522
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,442
He saw I was busy and beat it.

523
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,660
-That very adequately
describes his exit.

524
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,448
-He comes in that way
because he doesn't

525
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:13,937
like to go through the Bay.

526
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:14,636
Closer to the--

527
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,595
-Slightly fishy, Mr.--

528
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,143
-Very fishy.

529
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,951
Now, get this Hardway.

530
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,800
If I find out that
anything happened to Grady

531
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,287
in this place, I'm
going to tear it apart.

532
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:25,794
-If you ever do, I'll help you.

533
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,223
-C'mon, Wong.

534
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,172
-Goodbye, Mr. Lockett.

535
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,121
-Goodbye, Mr. Wong.

536
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:34,995
-Oh, sorry.

537
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:35,864
Didn't know you were busy.

538
00:26:35,864 --> 00:26:37,352
-He's not.

539
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:39,330
Because we're just leaving.

540
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:47,002
I beg your pardon, but we've met before

541
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:49,250
haven't we, miss uh-- miss, uh--

542
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,637
-Serova's the name,
but we haven't met.

543
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:53,455
-I'm so sorry.

544
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:56,053
Oh, now I know what
prompted my mistake.

545
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:59,689
I saw you sitting outside in a
car with young Mister Belden.

546
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:01,737
-What was he doing here?

547
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:02,906
-We had dinner here.

548
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:04,044
Do you mind?

549
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:06,242
-Execuse the boys,
Miss Serova, but it's

550
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:08,520
their business to be curious.

551
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,427
This is Mister Wong,
the famous detective.

552
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:15,742
And this is Captain Street
of the San Francisco police.

553
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:17,710
-Your head waiter says
you found my compact.

554
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,129
-Yes, it's in my desk.

555
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:20,078
I'll get it for you.

556
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:22,126
Drop in any time, boys.

557
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:24,014
-It'll be your turn to drop
in on us the next time.

558
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:31,825
-You're a help.

559
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:35,631
Why in blazes didn't you get rid
of Belden when I told you to?

560
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:36,990
-Well, I did.

561
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,717
He must've seen us outside
in the parking lot.

562
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,066
What did they want?

563
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,285
-You read the papers, don't you?

564
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,442
What do you think?

565
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:46,330
-I think that dead
policemen are bad medicine.

566
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,789
I don't like it, Harry.

567
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:48,758
-Relax.

568
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:52,154
They haven't got a thing on us.

569
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:54,502
So Grady was here last night.

570
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:56,380
What does that prove?

571
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,317
-That the party's getting
too rough for yours truly.

572
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:03,582
-So, don't tell me Miss
Serova's getting jittery, huh?

573
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,400
-Serova's getting out.

574
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,207
Murder's something I
don't want any part of.

575
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,146
I'm through.

576
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,364
-Oh, no, you're not.

577
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:13,152
When you're through,
it will be because I

578
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:15,190
tell you you're through.

579
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,987
-Are you threatening me?

580
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:18,956
-Maybe.

581
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:20,954
-Don't do it, Harry.

582
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:23,931
I know too much.

583
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:27,837
-Things, uh, happen to
people who know too much.

584
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:29,086
-Yeah.

585
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:31,633
They end up in the bay
like a certain policeman.

586
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:51,532
-That seafood gag of
Hardway's was a hot one.

587
00:28:51,532 --> 00:28:54,629
The young lady
who lost her compact.

588
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,187
More seafood, eh, Street?

589
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:56,877
-I'll say.

590
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:59,064
-What's her name?

591
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:01,152
-I thought I told you to scram.

592
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:03,060
-You're always
telling me to scram.

593
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,318
-Well, you're not going
to ride in a police car.

594
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:07,386
-OK, let me out and I'll
put on my roller skates.

595
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:14,209
-I'm telling you, I
don't like the set.

596
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:18,065
I don't like any part of it.

597
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:19,703
When a dead copper
spells trouble

598
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:22,120
and if this girl
starts to talk--

599
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:25,167
Yeah.

600
00:29:28,464 --> 00:29:29,403
Yeah, I think so, too.

601
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:35,416
-But this idea of
mine is something

602
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,274
entirely new in
radio, Mr. Forbes.

603
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,822
-Nevertheless, I'm against
continuing the program.

604
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:43,208
-But Forbes, Belden's has had
a radio program for years.

605
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,106
And it's been
excellent advertising.

606
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:48,343
-Not excellent enough to keep
you out of the receivership.

607
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:50,820
I represent the creditors and I
cannot approve the expenditure.

608
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,797
-But, Mr. Forbes, I'm
sure this new idea of mine

609
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:55,096
will create a lot of interest.

610
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:56,275
That means customers
for Belden's.

611
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:59,821
-I can only judge by past
performance, Mr. Griswold.

612
00:29:59,821 --> 00:30:03,427
Results have not
warranted the expense.

613
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,176
That all here?

614
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:04,876
-Yes.

615
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:07,773
-Oh, but Mr. Forbes.

616
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,732
This is a novelty.

617
00:30:08,732 --> 00:30:10,370
A complete one-act
play in which I

618
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:13,527
enact all the roles,
male and female.

619
00:30:13,527 --> 00:30:15,994
You see, Mr. Forbes,
impersonation is my forte.

620
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,163
-I think persistence
is your forte.

621
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:20,130
-Well, I tell you, this
is the type of program

622
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,408
that's bound to create comment.

623
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:23,606
Why not give it a chance?

624
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:26,293
Just glance through this
and you'll get the idea.

625
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:28,991
After the commercial,
the music fades out

626
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,619
and you hear
footsteps and a knock.

627
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:31,828
Now, read from there on.

628
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:57,361
-Pretty melodramatic, isn't it?

629
00:30:57,361 --> 00:31:00,418
-But that's the kind of stuff
they like nowadays, Mr. Forbes.

630
00:31:00,418 --> 00:31:02,875
The highly dramatic programs
are the most successful.

631
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:04,244
-Suppose we try it
for a couple of weeks.

632
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:07,111
It wouldn't cost a fortune
and it might get results.

633
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:08,509
-Well, all right, we'll try it.

634
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:09,918
-Thanks, Mr. Forbes.

635
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,186
I'm sure you won't be sorry.

636
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:13,444
We go on from 10
to 10:15, tonight.

637
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:14,723
I hope you're listening in.

638
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,121
-We will.

639
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,120
-Those bills are all right.

640
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,508
I'll see you in the morning.

641
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:20,227
-Hello, Frank.

642
00:31:20,227 --> 00:31:20,926
-Hello, Mr. Forbes.

643
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,041
-How you feeling, dad?

644
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:28,958
-Oh, as well as could be
expected considering the fact

645
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,975
that I don't have anything
to say about my own business.

646
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,513
-When you gonna
take me in with you?

647
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,221
-Not for a while, yet.

648
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:36,440
-But, dad, I've
got to go to work.

649
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,468
I've gotta make some money.

650
00:31:38,468 --> 00:31:39,847
-Isn't your allowance enough?

651
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,315
-No.

652
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:44,512
I'm going to get married.

653
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:45,810
-Who to?

654
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,588
That Serova woman?

655
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:48,498
-Miss Serova, yes.

656
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:51,065
How did you know?

657
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:53,732
-I haven't taken my
eyes off you completely.

658
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:55,640
You've been out with that
adventurous-- every night for

659
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,589
a month.

660
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,517
-I wouldn't talk like
that if I were you, dad.

661
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,355
We're both liable
to be sorry for it.

662
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:01,953
Besides, it won't
change my decision.

663
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,361
-Frank, I won't permit
you to wreck your life.

664
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:06,029
To throw away your entire
future for the sake

665
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,348
of that scheming, unscrupulous--

666
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:10,125
That's enough.

667
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,494
I'm sorry you feel
that way about it dad,

668
00:32:11,494 --> 00:32:13,941
but there's nothing
you can do about it.

669
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:16,378
-You'll never marry that
woman, do you understand?

670
00:32:16,378 --> 00:32:17,078
Never.

671
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:25,809
-Morning, Soapy.

672
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:27,127
Everything ship-shape?

673
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:29,355
-No sign of the police,
if that's what you mean.

674
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:33,271
-Oh, why Soapy, that's the
farthest thing from my mind.

675
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:34,769
Bring me the checks
from last night, eh?

676
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:35,469
-OK.

677
00:32:58,794 --> 00:32:59,493
-Hey.

678
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:02,630
Have you been fooling
around my desk?

679
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,329
-Me?

680
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:04,998
-Mhm.

681
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:07,056
-I wouldn't touch
your stuff, boss.

682
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:07,855
Something missing?

683
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,133
-Yeah, my gun.

684
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,971
-Surely, that ain't so good.

685
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:12,340
When did you last see it, boss?

686
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,569
-I don't know.

687
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:14,947
Yesterday, I guess.

688
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:15,906
I want to talk to you.

689
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,558
Now what are you
thinking of, coming

690
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:25,047
down here after what's happened?

691
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,484
I told you I'd get the
stuff to you as soon as it

692
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:28,573
was safe for Cap to bring it in.

693
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,942
-That isn't why I'm here.

694
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,560
I want to know what
that Serova woman is

695
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,117
doing running
around with my son.

696
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:36,145
-Well, I did my best.

697
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:38,093
You know, after all,
it's not such a bad idea.

698
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:41,010
Sort of a closed corporation.

699
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,189
-Are you mad?

700
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,456
My boy has no part in all this.

701
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,604
I went into it because it
was the only hope I had

702
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:49,601
of saving my business, of
meeting my obligations.

703
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:51,319
But not to the extent
of wrecking his life.

704
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:54,216
And that's what this
marriage would mean.

705
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:55,755
-That's your problem.

706
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:57,053
Right now, I have
more important things

707
00:33:57,053 --> 00:34:00,500
to do than nurse a lovesick pup.

708
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,336
-If you value your neck,
you'll do something about it.

709
00:34:03,336 --> 00:34:06,134
I'm warning you, Lockett, before
I see this happen to my son,

710
00:34:06,134 --> 00:34:09,769
I'll blast everything wide open.

711
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,018
-Including yourself?

712
00:34:11,018 --> 00:34:13,456
-Including myself.

713
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:14,156
-Uh huh.

714
00:34:14,156 --> 00:34:15,154
I see.

715
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:18,791
You like the idea of a
few months on Alcatraz?

716
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:22,197
-I'll stop at nothing.

717
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:43,234
-Hello.

718
00:34:43,234 --> 00:34:48,280
Hello, Tanya, this is Harry.

719
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,106
I want to apologize for the
way I talked to you last night.

720
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:56,142
Oh, you know I couldn't mean it.

721
00:34:56,142 --> 00:34:58,619
We were both a little, uh,
jittery and unreasonable.

722
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:05,732
Now listen, Tanya, I
uh, I want to see you.

723
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:08,039
I have to talk over
something with you.

724
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,827
I think you'd be interested.

725
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:12,854
-All right, I'll
be in all evening.

726
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:13,554
Goodbye.

727
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,825
-I hope I didn't keep
you waiting, Clancy.

728
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:22,724
-Oh, that's all right, sir.

729
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,762
Don't mention it.

730
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:33,992
-I'll stay out here and
keep an eye on things.

731
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:16,108
Mr. Wong, Mr. Wong.

732
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,766
-It's all right,
Clancy, he missed me.

733
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:18,526
-Oh, I'm glad of that.

734
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:19,225
Who was it, sir?

735
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:21,832
-I haven't the least idea,
but the shot came from there.

736
00:36:21,832 --> 00:36:23,660
-Well, we'll find
out who that is.

737
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:49,354
-Well whoever it was,
beat it out the back

738
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:50,472
and left the door wide open.

739
00:36:50,472 --> 00:36:52,290
-Whoever it was, he
killed Mr. Belden.

740
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,959
-What?

741
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,076
Oh, glory be.

742
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:56,776
-Get Street.

743
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:57,475
-Yes, sir.

744
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:37,064
-This case has got
a million angles.

745
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:39,821
If this jade matches the stuff
we found in Grady's office,

746
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:41,879
Belden had a
fortune hidden away.

747
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:44,406
And I can't understand why
he was in receivership.

748
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,394
-Perhaps he went into
this kind of business

749
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:48,242
to get out of receivership.

750
00:37:48,242 --> 00:37:49,671
-What's that receiver's name?

751
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:50,829
Maybe he can help us.

752
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:52,468
-Man named Forbes.

753
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:53,576
-You know where he lives?

754
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:55,235
-At the town apartments.

755
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,833
-Good, go up and see him.

756
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:59,211
Clancy, call my office and
have young Belden picked up.

757
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:00,539
Tell them to hold him
until I get there.

758
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:01,558
And wait for the coroner.

759
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:02,287
-Yes, sir.

760
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:11,218
-Good evening, gentlemen.

761
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:13,216
-We want to Mr.
Forbes, John T Forbes.

762
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:13,915
-Who's calling?

763
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:15,803
-Captain Street of
the police department.

764
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:16,503
-Ring 22, please.

765
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:25,243
-Captain Street of the police
department to see Mr. Forbes.

766
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:26,332
Yes, sir.

767
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:30,118
Go on up, Captain
Stree.t That's number 22.

768
00:38:30,118 --> 00:38:31,807
-Captain Street.

769
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,824
What on
Earth can he want?

770
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:40,897
-I wonder if I've
forgotten a speed ticket.

771
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,285
-Excuse me.

772
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:45,153
Percy, take my hand, will you?

773
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:47,091
-OK, but it's 10 o'clock
and I'll have to meet Elsie.

774
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,259
-Probably won't be very long.

775
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:54,273
-Captain Street?

776
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:54,972
-That's right.

777
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:55,692
And this is Mr. Wong.

778
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:56,391
-How do you do?

779
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,090
-How do you do?

780
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:57,949
-Come in here, gentlemen.

781
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:58,649
-Thank you.

782
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:07,639
-I'm afraid we interrupted
you're game, Mr. Forbes.

783
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,368
-Oh, that's all right.

784
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:10,356
Sit down, gentlemen.

785
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,915
I've heard a great
deal about you

786
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:13,973
at one time or
another, Mr. Wong.

787
00:39:13,973 --> 00:39:15,861
I'm certainly glad to meet you.

788
00:39:15,861 --> 00:39:16,790
-Thank you.

789
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,558
-Well, now gentlemen,
what can I do for you?

790
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:20,526
-Might as well come to
the point, Mr. Forbes.

791
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,783
Frank Belden Senior, the front
for which you are receiver,

792
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:27,049
was found dead a half an
hour ago in his store.

793
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:29,446
What?

794
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:32,273
Poor old Frank.

795
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:36,040
I had no idea he felt
so desperately about it.

796
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,798
Of course, I knew his,
uh, financial affairs

797
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:38,497
were in bad shape.

798
00:39:38,497 --> 00:39:41,034
-It's not suicide, Mr. Forbes.

799
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:41,734
He was murdered.

800
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,696
-Well, this certainly
knocks me out.

801
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:50,664
I've got to have a drink.

802
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:52,632
How about you gentlemen?

803
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:53,411
-Thank you, no.

804
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:54,111
-No thanks.

805
00:39:58,216 --> 00:39:58,916
-Murdered.

806
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:06,058
Who, uh, who found him?

807
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,597
Give me more of the details.

808
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:10,204
-Mr. Wong found the body.

809
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:11,443
-Wong?

810
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:12,871
Were you in the store?

811
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:16,897
-I was making an investigation
of Belden's stock.

812
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:21,842
I found this piece Jade worth
at least $2,000 or $3,000.

813
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:25,937
-And there are several more
pieces too, just as valuable.

814
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:29,484
-Why, I thought they carried
only cheap costume jewelry.

815
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:32,071
Could he have been
concealing any, uh,

816
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,859
valuable assets from me?

817
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,767
-That's exactly what
we wanted to find out.

818
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:39,853
-I'd like to go
down to the store

819
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:41,461
and make a complete
examination of their stock.

820
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:42,260
Would that be all right?

821
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,319
-I think it's a good idea.

822
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:50,901
-Here.

823
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:52,000
Will you have a
cigar, gentlemen?

824
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,700
-Yes, thanks.

825
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,038
-No, thank you.

826
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:56,885
-One more thing I
think you should know.

827
00:40:56,885 --> 00:40:58,953
That jade was smuggled.

828
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:01,580
And one of our own men
on the smuggling detail

829
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,678
was murdered running it down.

830
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:07,114
And the trail seems to
lead to Belden's store.

831
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:08,643
-Why, this is the worst
thing I've ever heard.

832
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:11,979
-Excuse me.

833
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:13,847
Hello?

834
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,186
Yes.

835
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:15,975
It's for you.

836
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,424
-Thanks.

837
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:20,171
Street speaking.

838
00:41:20,171 --> 00:41:22,039
What?

839
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:23,417
I'll go right up.

840
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,856
There's been a shooting
on the floor above.

841
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:25,715
Can we get out this way?

842
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:26,414
-Yes.

843
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:55,044
-That's that Serova girl.

844
00:41:55,044 --> 00:41:55,864
-How do you like this?

845
00:41:55,864 --> 00:41:59,180
A murder right over my head.

846
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,879
There?

847
00:41:59,879 --> 00:42:00,629
Oh, you're the clerk.

848
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:01,328
-Yes, sir.

849
00:42:01,328 --> 00:42:03,546
I telephoned headquarters
from downstairs.

850
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:04,335
-Thanks.

851
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,504
What do you know about this?

852
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:07,681
Nothing except what the
switchboard operator told me.

853
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:08,770
What did she tell you?

854
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,798
Well, I was sitting in
the lobby when all of a sudden,

855
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:13,525
she started yelling, Miss
Serova's being killed.

856
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:15,833
-All right, all right.

857
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,532
Take it easy.

858
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:19,599
Sit down.

859
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,956
-What did you hear on the phone?

860
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,125
-Well, I was sitting
there as usual

861
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,373
when the buzzer sounded
and it was a call from 32.

862
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:26,771
-What time was that?

863
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:28,300
-About 14 after 10.

864
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,118
-That's an odd time
to remember, 10:14.

865
00:42:30,118 --> 00:42:32,735
-Well, I'm not sure,
but it was 15 after 10

866
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:33,754
when I heard the shot.

867
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:35,203
And they were arguing
about a minute.

868
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:36,521
Who was arguing?

869
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,680
Miss Serova and the man.

870
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,669
Well,
what were they arguing about?

871
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:39,448
What'd they say?

872
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:40,077
Well, he said,

873
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:41,386
get away from that telephone.

874
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:43,524
That's the last time you're
gonna pull that stuff on me.

875
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:46,211
And Miss Serova yelled,
don't shoot, don't shoot.

876
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:47,480
But he did.

877
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,368
-It's quite possible, Street.

878
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:52,774
The receiver's off the stand.

879
00:42:52,774 --> 00:42:54,133
-Yeah.

880
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,391
-Did you recognize
the man's voice?

881
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:56,291
-No.

882
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,639
But he was awful mad.

883
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:00,097
-Anybody come through that lobby
that might have come up here?

884
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:00,976
-No, sir.

885
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:02,454
-Did you pass anybody
on the way up?

886
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,513
-I didn't see anybody.

887
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:04,542
-All right, that's all for now.

888
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:07,978
Stick around downstairs.

889
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:09,237
Oh, hello doc.

890
00:43:09,237 --> 00:43:10,326
Prints, photographs, the works.

891
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:15,021
And I want you to get me
that--

892
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:17,319
Oh, Little Bow Peep, huh?

893
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:19,117
What are you made up for?

894
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:20,046
That's all I need.

895
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,960
-Just be sure to get
everything in this corner,

896
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,308
would you please?

897
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:35,629
-Hello, Ballard.

898
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:37,208
What are
you doing here?

899
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:38,437
I thought I told
you to tail Hardway.

900
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:39,475
-I was trailing him.

901
00:43:39,475 --> 00:43:41,344
I lost him in the traffic
at Eight and Market

902
00:43:41,344 --> 00:43:43,271
around 9 o'clock and I've been
looking for him ever since.

903
00:43:43,271 --> 00:43:43,971
-That's wonderful.

904
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:45,459
Get my office on the phone.

905
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:48,606
DET.

906
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:50,024
Get me
police headquarters.

907
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:54,210
-Hey, remember the last
guy we saw Serova with?

908
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,358
Hardway Harry.

909
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:58,136
And he ditched
Ballard an hour ago.

910
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:58,835
DET.

911
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:01,313
Just a
minute, hold it Mike.

912
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:02,791
-Hello, Mike.

913
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:05,159
Hardway ditched Ballard
about an hour ago.

914
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:05,858
Eighth and Market.

915
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:07,366
Yeah, I want you to
send out a couple of men

916
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:09,334
and have them-- What?

917
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:14,519
Hardway Harry's been sitting
in my office for the last hour.

918
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,226
Get
her off the phone.

919
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:18,025
-Come on, get off there.

920
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:18,784
Put that thing away.

921
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:19,484
Get out of here.

922
00:44:19,484 --> 00:44:21,072
Well, 327,
Harry Lockett did it.

923
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:22,071
I was just phoning the office.

924
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,059
How he be doing it
when he's sitting in my office?

925
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:25,437
Well, don't
know, it was your idea.

926
00:44:25,437 --> 00:44:26,137
-Woah.

927
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,301
-Oh, don't go away.

928
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,030
Do you know anything about this?

929
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:39,862
-Hey, even if he didn't do
it, he could have had it done.

930
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:42,729
-Harry's alibi is perfect.

931
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:44,058
Hello, Mike?

932
00:44:44,058 --> 00:44:46,066
I want you to hold Hardway.

933
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:47,994
I don't care how
you hold him, hold him.

934
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:48,693
Bill.

935
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:49,802
- Bill, the maid.
- Will you stop?

936
00:44:49,802 --> 00:44:50,731
Well,
Bill, the housekeeper--

937
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,030
Will you
quit picking on me?

938
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,878
-Mr. Wong, the
housekeeper saw a man

939
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:56,355
sneaking up the back stairs.

940
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:57,504
Sit down.

941
00:44:57,504 --> 00:44:58,723
I'm sorry.

942
00:44:58,723 --> 00:45:00,631
Uh, who are you?

943
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,119
-I'm the maid on this floor.

944
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,218
-Well, where were
you when this--

945
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:04,347
-She was looking in the door.

946
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:06,624
-Will you be quiet?

947
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,082
You say you saw a man
coming up the back stairs.

948
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,630
-I finished by 10 o'clock.

949
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,258
I was going down the back
stairs when he came in.

950
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:14,686
-Who came in?

951
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:15,665
-The young man.

952
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:16,854
-What young man?

953
00:45:16,854 --> 00:45:18,552
-Mr. Belden.

954
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,120
-Belden Junior.

955
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,258
-He was in the habit of
using the back stairs?

956
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:22,997
-Sometimes.

957
00:45:22,997 --> 00:45:24,616
-Then, he had his own key.

958
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:26,624
-Yes, sir.

959
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:27,403
-That settles it.

960
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:28,532
Ballard, pick up young Belden.

961
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:29,231
-Good idea.

962
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:33,796
-That's all for now, thanks.

963
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:48,621
-You know, Wong?

964
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,849
Belden knew Serova.

965
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,037
Hardway knew her.

966
00:45:52,037 --> 00:45:54,834
They're all mixed up
in this thing some way.

967
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:56,602
I'm going to have them all
come in my office tomorrow

968
00:45:56,602 --> 00:45:57,611
morning at 10 o'clock.

969
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:00,808
I'll-- what am I doing?

970
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,571
-Sit down, Hardway.

971
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:19,199
See who's out there, Jim.

972
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:20,927
-Well, how'd you do?

973
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,284
-Not bad.

974
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:25,822
Have a pretty good breakfast
for you fellas, you know?

975
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:26,991
Thanks for the cigarettes.

976
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:29,448
-Oh, we always take
care of our guests.

977
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:30,257
Who's out there?

978
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:31,856
-Soapy and Cap Anderson.

979
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:32,545
-All right, Jim.

980
00:46:35,282 --> 00:46:36,181
Couple of friends of yours.

981
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:41,995
What were you doing
here last night?

982
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:45,671
-Well, I caught one of
your boys following me

983
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:48,738
and I figured you wanted
to make sure where I was.

984
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:52,134
So, when he lost
me about 9 o'clock,

985
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:53,513
I decided I better check in.

986
00:46:53,513 --> 00:46:54,642
So you'd
have an alibi,

987
00:46:54,642 --> 00:46:57,489
because you knew Tanya Serova
was gonna be killed last night.

988
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:58,248
-What?

989
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,685
-Yeah, murdered last night.

990
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:04,452
-Well, coming in here wasn't
such a bad idea, was it?

991
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:06,290
-What time did you get here?

992
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,647
9:29, on the dot.

993
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:10,116
-Oh, got it figured
down to the minute, huh?

994
00:47:10,116 --> 00:47:11,514
-Yeah, you can check
with the sarge on it.

995
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:12,583
-I know, I know.

996
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,872
-So.

997
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,070
-Hello, Wong.

998
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,399
-Oh, Mister Wong--

999
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:17,578
-The Chinese Copper.

1000
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:23,232
-Look here, Street, you
haven't got a thing on me.

1001
00:47:23,232 --> 00:47:24,740
I knew Serova, sure.

1002
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,718
She used to come to
my place very often.

1003
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,077
But so do a lot of other people.

1004
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:29,186
-Including young Belden.

1005
00:47:29,186 --> 00:47:29,885
-Yes.

1006
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:31,543
With Serova, yes.

1007
00:47:31,543 --> 00:47:33,271
-How well did you
know young Belden?

1008
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:36,448
-Casually.

1009
00:47:36,448 --> 00:47:37,727
-How well did you
know his father?

1010
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:41,912
-Just an acquaintance.

1011
00:47:41,912 --> 00:47:43,111
-When was the last
time you saw him?

1012
00:47:46,148 --> 00:47:48,805
-I saw him in my
office yesterday.

1013
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:52,172
He came to pay his
son's bar bill.

1014
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:53,990
-And you had a little quarrel.

1015
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,078
Then you followed him
down to his jewelry store.

1016
00:47:56,078 --> 00:47:57,506
And shot him.

1017
00:47:57,506 --> 00:47:59,134
-Old man Belden's shot?

1018
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:01,612
-Yeah.

1019
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:02,781
That's too bad.

1020
00:48:02,781 --> 00:48:03,590
-Yeah, it is too bad.

1021
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,618
He got it the same way Grady
got it, in the back of the neck.

1022
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,386
What's your alibi for that?

1023
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:11,342
-I was being trailed by one
of your coppers, by good luck.

1024
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,829
What?

1025
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,707
Man named
Forbes is out here.

1026
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:16,536
He said you sent for him.

1027
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:18,125
-All right, send him in.

1028
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,114
Wait outside, Hardway.

1029
00:48:28,943 --> 00:48:29,922
-Morning, Mr. Forbes.

1030
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:30,951
-You wanted to see me, Captain?

1031
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:31,700
-Yes.

1032
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,649
You know Mister Wong.

1033
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:33,349
-Oh, yes.

1034
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,078
How are you, Mr. Wong?

1035
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:34,777
-Forbes.

1036
00:48:34,777 --> 00:48:36,166
-We were kind of
interrupted last night

1037
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,004
and I'd kind of like to
find out what you know

1038
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:40,042
what you know
about young Belden.

1039
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,040
-Well, I'm afraid I
can't tell you very much.

1040
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,958
Most of my dealing has
been with his father.

1041
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,755
-Well, what sort of a kid is he?

1042
00:48:46,755 --> 00:48:49,682
-He's always struck me as being
a rather nice sort of a chap.

1043
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:52,579
Quiet, well brought
up, and-- say,

1044
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:53,897
you don't think for
a minute that he

1045
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,705
had anything to do with
his fathers murder?

1046
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:56,405
-Maybe.

1047
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:58,213
I do know he's mixed
up in Serova's death.

1048
00:48:58,213 --> 00:49:00,311
-Oh, I can't believe
that, Captain.

1049
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,190
Why, it isn't possible.

1050
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,019
-I'm afraid you're wrong.

1051
00:49:04,117 --> 00:49:04,916
-Here's Belden, Captain.

1052
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:07,014
Picked him up in a quick
lunch joint, having coffee.

1053
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:09,980
-All right, sit down.

1054
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,769
-Have you met Mister Wong?

1055
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:13,856
Perhaps you met him last night.

1056
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:15,645
-No, I've never met Mister Wong.

1057
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:16,923
How do you do?

1058
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:18,611
-We've been looking
for you all night.

1059
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:19,650
Where were you?

1060
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:20,779
-I don't know why
the police would

1061
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:22,627
be interested in my movements.

1062
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:23,806
What's this all about?

1063
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:26,493
-What were you doing in Tanya
Serova's apartment last night?

1064
00:49:26,493 --> 00:49:27,732
Oh, we know you were there.

1065
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,530
The maid saw you
sneaking up the back way.

1066
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,647
-If I were you, I'd tell the
captain all he wants to know.

1067
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:34,315
-Well, I don't know what
this is all about, Frank,

1068
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:37,582
but you're welcome
to my legal advice

1069
00:49:37,582 --> 00:49:39,040
if I can be of any
assistance to you.

1070
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,658
For his father's sake,
I feel that I aught

1071
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:42,377
to do everything I
can to protect him.

1072
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:43,076
-All right.

1073
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:44,844
But I still want to know
what you were doing in Tanya

1074
00:49:44,844 --> 00:49:46,872
Serova's apartment last
night at 10 o'clock.

1075
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:48,870
-Were you there, Frank?

1076
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:49,649
-Yes, I was there.

1077
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:52,546
But-- but, I didn't kill her.

1078
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:54,944
She-- she was dead
when I found her.

1079
00:49:54,944 --> 00:49:55,643
-Don't give me that.

1080
00:49:55,643 --> 00:49:57,841
-Well, you don't know
what you're saying, Frank.

1081
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:59,269
I demand that this
boy be advised

1082
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,997
of his constitutional rights.

1083
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,496
-I'll take care of his
constitutional rights.

1084
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:04,184
This is a murder investigation.

1085
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:07,251
Tanya Serova was killed
last night at 10:15.

1086
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,799
Just 15 minutes
after this young man

1087
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:09,928
was seen going
into her apartment.

1088
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:10,717
-It's not true.

1089
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,126
It's not true, I tell ya.

1090
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:13,774
She was dead when I found her.

1091
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:15,932
-Are you sure of
the time, Street?

1092
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:17,580
-Your own switchboard
operator heard

1093
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,678
the argument and the report.

1094
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:22,275
-They told Street in
your study, you remember?

1095
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:24,343
-Yes, yes, that's right.

1096
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:26,321
-All right, Belden,
alibi out of that.

1097
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:27,210
Come clean.

1098
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,179
Why'd you kill her?

1099
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:29,667
I didn't,
I didn't, I tell ya.

1100
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,895
I-- I loved Tanya.

1101
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:32,874
Why would I want to kill her?

1102
00:50:32,874 --> 00:50:34,432
-I'll tell ya why.

1103
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:35,741
Because you were jealous.

1104
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,389
You thought she was
double crossing you.

1105
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:39,587
And you went up to her
apartment and you quarrelled.

1106
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:40,027
And then
you killed her.

1107
00:50:40,027 --> 00:50:40,726
-That's a lie.

1108
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:42,164
Every word of it's a lie.

1109
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,773
-So you found your
sweetheart murdered.

1110
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:45,221
And what did you do?

1111
00:50:45,221 --> 00:50:46,749
You ran out and hid.

1112
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:48,618
Why didn't you call the police?

1113
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:49,317
-I don't know.

1114
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:50,066
I was half crazy.

1115
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:50,765
I--

1116
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:51,554
-Now, see here, Street.

1117
00:50:51,554 --> 00:50:53,273
This boy is in no
condition for questioning.

1118
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:54,162
-I'll say he isn't.

1119
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:55,690
Because he doesn't
know the answers.

1120
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,426
-Gentleman, I suggest that
we all calm down and allow

1121
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:02,223
young Mister Belden to tell us
what happened in his own way.

1122
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:05,040
-All right, all
right, I'm listening.

1123
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,106
-Now supposing we go back
just a little way, shall we?

1124
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:13,661
When you did you last
see Tanya Serova alive?

1125
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:16,728
-When she promised to marry
me, yesterday afternoon, late.

1126
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:18,646
-And where was that?

1127
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:20,035
-At her apartment.

1128
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,742
I, uh, I was going to
take her to dinner,

1129
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:24,520
see, but she said
she didn't feel well.

1130
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,719
So-- so I went
out and got a bite

1131
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,487
and then I drove
around a little while.

1132
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:28,346
-Yes, and then?

1133
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:31,423
-Well, on the way home, I
saw a light in the apartment

1134
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:34,240
and I-- well, I went up
to tell her goodnight.

1135
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,617
-Are you in the habit of
using it the back way?

1136
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:37,626
-Yeah, I had a key.

1137
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:40,913
See, sometimes Tanya wasn't in
and I'd go in and wait for her.

1138
00:51:40,913 --> 00:51:42,182
-Yeah, well she
was in last night.

1139
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,749
Did you use the key, then?

1140
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,527
-No.

1141
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:47,226
No, that's funny.

1142
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:49,854
I remember that
the door was open.

1143
00:51:49,854 --> 00:51:52,121
-What else do you remember?

1144
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:54,269
-Yes, Belden, go on.

1145
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:57,705
-Well, I-- I went and called
her, but there was no answer.

1146
00:51:57,705 --> 00:52:01,292
So I went in the living
room and-- on the floor

1147
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:03,679
I saw her by the window.

1148
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,187
-Near the telephone?

1149
00:52:06,187 --> 00:52:06,886
-I don't know.

1150
00:52:06,886 --> 00:52:09,513
I-- I didn't see
anything but Tanya.

1151
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,938
-Was there anything
else in the room

1152
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:16,766
that was unusual that
attracted your attention?

1153
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:17,874
Anything at all?

1154
00:52:20,522 --> 00:52:22,340
-Yes, yeah, I remember
that the radio was on.

1155
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,028
-Aw, don't kid me.

1156
00:52:24,028 --> 00:52:27,195
The radio wasn't playing
when I got there.

1157
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:29,592
If you didn't leave that
apartment till before 10:15,

1158
00:52:29,592 --> 00:52:31,071
where'd you go?

1159
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,089
-I don't know, I just--
I-- I-- drove around.

1160
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:34,647
I don't know where I went.

1161
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:35,706
I drove all night.

1162
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:39,102
-What?

1163
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:40,181
-Captain?

1164
00:52:40,181 --> 00:52:42,049
Fellow out here named Griswold
says he's got to see you.

1165
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:42,748
-Who's Griswold?

1166
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:43,448
What does he want?

1167
00:52:43,448 --> 00:52:45,046
What does he do?

1168
00:52:45,046 --> 00:52:46,295
-What do you want
to see him about?

1169
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:47,374
-I've got to talk to him.

1170
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:49,601
I'm from radio station LMAB.

1171
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:52,129
-He's from a radio
station, LMAB.

1172
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:53,687
-I don't know anybody
from a radio station.

1173
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:54,726
Tell him to wait.

1174
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:55,655
-He says you've got to wait.

1175
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:03,287
-Frank, come clean.

1176
00:53:03,287 --> 00:53:05,635
You didn't leave that
apartment until after 10:15.

1177
00:53:05,635 --> 00:53:07,113
After you killed her.

1178
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:08,871
Stop it,
I say, stop it.

1179
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:12,158
-Street, you're getting nowhere
browbeating the boy this way.

1180
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:14,605
Maybe if you let me talk
to him quietly somewhere.

1181
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:15,334
-All right, all right.

1182
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:16,793
I'll talk to him quietly.

1183
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:19,170
Would you like to
see your father?

1184
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,949
-No.

1185
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:23,596
Why should I want to see him?

1186
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:25,024
He's probably glad she's dead?

1187
00:53:25,024 --> 00:53:26,653
-Why should he be glad?

1188
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:28,241
Doesn't he like her?

1189
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,510
-No.

1190
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,787
-Did you quarrel over
her with your father?

1191
00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:32,477
-Yeah.

1192
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:34,934
Yeah, we had a quarrel
and I walked out on him.

1193
00:53:34,934 --> 00:53:37,651
-And then you walked back last
night to his jewelry store.

1194
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:38,420
And shot him.

1195
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,120
Killed him.

1196
00:53:41,797 --> 00:53:44,914
-You-- you mean
my father's dead?

1197
00:53:44,914 --> 00:53:47,251
Stop it,
will you, stop it.

1198
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:48,849
What are you trying to do to me?

1199
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:50,588
Would somebody get
me a glass of water?

1200
00:53:50,588 --> 00:53:51,627
-Oh, nevermind the water.
-Oh, I protest.

1201
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:52,875
Get him a glass of water.

1202
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:54,264
Where is it?

1203
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,821
-Outside.

1204
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:57,720
-Something wrong, Captain?

1205
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,549
-Yes, get me that brandy.

1206
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,059
-Now go and sit down.

1207
00:54:08,059 --> 00:54:08,908
What else do you want?

1208
00:54:08,908 --> 00:54:10,217
C'mon, what is this?

1209
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:11,586
-What am I supposed to do?

1210
00:54:11,586 --> 00:54:13,743
Spend the weekend here?

1211
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:15,162
-He'll get to you.

1212
00:54:15,162 --> 00:54:16,580
-Mr. Hardway.

1213
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,749
-The press.

1214
00:54:17,749 --> 00:54:18,708
-Yes, the press.

1215
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,507
What do you know, today?

1216
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:20,676
Pardon me.

1217
00:54:31,745 --> 00:54:32,444
-What's the matter?

1218
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:35,870
Who is this?

1219
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,539
-It's the fellow from the
radio station, Griswold.

1220
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:42,274
-Where'd this paper
file come from?

1221
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:43,343
-Say, that looks like mine.

1222
00:54:43,343 --> 00:54:45,960
It's missing from the desk.

1223
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,977
-All right, who did it?

1224
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:50,995
This is a pay off
right in my own office.

1225
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:52,493
Stay away from that phone.

1226
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:01,504
-Start talking, Hardway.

1227
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:02,203
-What, again?

1228
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:10,704
-Sorry for the
interruption, Mr. Wong,

1229
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:13,181
but that was a new program
and I wanted to check on it.

1230
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,990
-Not at all, it's
all most interesting.

1231
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,667
-Yes, but full of headaches.

1232
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:20,094
Replacing Griswold is
going to be one of them.

1233
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:21,912
-I can quite imagine.

1234
00:55:21,912 --> 00:55:23,720
His programs were
popular, weren't they?

1235
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,420
-Very.

1236
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,078
He was a talented young man.

1237
00:55:26,078 --> 00:55:28,685
Wrote most of the sketches
and played all of the parts

1238
00:55:28,685 --> 00:55:30,314
in them.

1239
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:32,381
-He played female
roles, as well?

1240
00:55:32,381 --> 00:55:34,599
-Oh, yes.

1241
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:38,475
In the sketch you want to see,
the one they did last night,

1242
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:40,723
he played a very
emotional feminine role.

1243
00:55:45,877 --> 00:55:46,916
-Here's the manuscript for it.

1244
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,244
-Thank you.

1245
00:55:49,244 --> 00:55:52,730
Now, this program went on the
air sharply at 10 o'clock?

1246
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:53,649
-Oh, yes.

1247
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:54,998
radio works on split seconds.

1248
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:57,825
Every program is timed, exactly.

1249
00:55:57,825 --> 00:55:59,653
-And it ran for how long?

1250
00:55:59,653 --> 00:56:01,431
-15 minutes, in all.

1251
00:56:01,431 --> 00:56:04,828
The sketch went on at ten, one
and a half, and finished 10:14.

1252
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,686
The balance of the
program time was taken up

1253
00:56:06,686 --> 00:56:10,032
with, uh, commercials
as advertising.

1254
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:12,759
Uh, would it disturb you if
I turned on this program?

1255
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:13,458
-Not at all.

1256
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:17,744
I've just finished, but I'd
like to take this with me.

1257
00:56:17,744 --> 00:56:18,723
-Oh, perfectly all right.

1258
00:56:18,723 --> 00:56:19,622
-Thank you very much.

1259
00:56:19,622 --> 00:56:20,321
Goodbye.

1260
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:21,500
-Goodbye.

1261
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:37,194
-How do you do, sir?

1262
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:37,703
Can I help you?

1263
00:56:37,703 --> 00:56:38,402
-Yes.

1264
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,631
Is this the new
remote control radio?

1265
00:56:39,631 --> 00:56:40,330
-Why yes.

1266
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,589
And a very fine instrument, too.

1267
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:43,297
-I wonder if you'd
be kind enough

1268
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:44,426
to give me a demonstration.

1269
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:45,355
-I'd be glad to.

1270
00:56:45,355 --> 00:56:47,223
Won't you sit down?

1271
00:56:47,223 --> 00:56:49,561
-Thank you.

1272
00:56:49,561 --> 00:56:52,817
-Now, this is the
remote control box.

1273
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:55,824
-Like the dial on an
automatic telephone.

1274
00:56:55,824 --> 00:56:57,922
-And works very much
on the same principal.

1275
00:56:57,922 --> 00:56:59,371
You see, it's not
attached in any way

1276
00:56:59,371 --> 00:57:01,269
to the demonstration radio.

1277
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:03,207
However, being in
any part of the house

1278
00:57:03,207 --> 00:57:04,375
and desiring to
change the program,

1279
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,523
we simply change the
dial and the radio

1280
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,002
automatically switches.

1281
00:57:08,002 --> 00:57:09,330
I'll show you.

1282
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:20,299
-At just what distance would
that still be effective?

1283
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:23,785
-Guaranteed up to 200 feet.

1284
00:57:23,785 --> 00:57:26,302
-And you can shut the
radio off in the same way?

1285
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:27,002
-Oh, yes.

1286
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:29,379
just press down on
this, right here.

1287
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:42,176
-What, again?

1288
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:42,905
-Yeah.

1289
00:57:42,905 --> 00:57:44,803
-Didn't take long for that
lawyer to get you and the boys

1290
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:45,792
out, did it Hardway?

1291
00:57:45,792 --> 00:57:47,141
-Why should it?

1292
00:57:47,141 --> 00:57:49,738
Say, listen, you can't hang
that murder wrap on any of us.

1293
00:57:49,738 --> 00:57:51,336
-Somebody killed Griswold.

1294
00:57:51,336 --> 00:57:52,835
And three of you were
there when it happened.

1295
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:55,162
-Yeah, and he plenty of others.

1296
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:59,008
That office of yours was a close
second to a railroad station.

1297
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,956
But, uh, what's this visit for?

1298
00:58:00,956 --> 00:58:03,234
-According to
ballistics, the same gun

1299
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:06,021
killed Serova, Belden and Grady.

1300
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:07,939
Mind if I check yours?

1301
00:58:07,939 --> 00:58:09,188
-You know I don't carry a gun.

1302
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:11,885
I haven't had one
around here in years.

1303
00:58:11,885 --> 00:58:14,262
C'mon, search the place.

1304
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:16,380
You think if I had one, I would
keep it here just to show--

1305
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,527
-Looks like you're getting
a little careless, Hardway.

1306
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:22,484
That gun matches those bullets,
it'll be too bad for you.

1307
00:58:22,484 --> 00:58:23,673
Get that to ballistics.

1308
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:25,950
-So you still think
I killed Serova

1309
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,038
while I was in your office, eh?

1310
00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:29,886
-You could have
farmed that rat out.

1311
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:32,134
Take him away.

1312
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,711
-You're making a
mistake, Street.

1313
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,140
Murder is not my racket.

1314
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,839
-Maybe.

1315
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:38,537
We'll wait and see what
that ballistic report says.

1316
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:28,265
-All right, keep you
hands right there.

1317
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:28,964
Turn around.

1318
00:59:31,512 --> 00:59:34,718
Oh, Cap Anderson, huh?

1319
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:36,417
From Harry Lockett's
fishing barge.

1320
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:41,731
So this is the
thief who supplies

1321
00:59:41,731 --> 00:59:43,349
this place with jade, huh?

1322
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:46,007
Same stuff that Wong
found at Belden's.

1323
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:49,403
Now I know how it comes in
and how you get rid of it.

1324
00:59:49,403 --> 00:59:51,960
You better figure on spending
quite some time ashore

1325
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,529
this trip, Cap.

1326
00:59:53,529 --> 00:59:55,247
You can't beat this rap so easy.

1327
00:59:55,247 --> 00:59:55,946
Out that door.

1328
01:02:04,432 --> 01:02:06,600
-This is Mr. Wong, Bessie.

1329
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,778
I'll be experimenting with
the phone for a little while

1330
01:02:08,778 --> 01:02:10,346
so pay no attention if it rings.

1331
01:02:20,575 --> 01:02:21,674
-Oh, come in Forbes.

1332
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:23,033
Oh, it's you Mr. Wong.

1333
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:25,460
Well, that is a relief.

1334
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,717
I was wondering who was up here.

1335
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:31,734
Oh, you put that string
down past my window.

1336
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:32,463
-Yes.

1337
01:02:32,463 --> 01:02:36,489
When I found the receiver
off the stand last night,

1338
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:38,626
I had an idea that the
switchboard operator

1339
01:02:38,626 --> 01:02:41,803
was intended to
overhear what she heard.

1340
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:42,962
-I don't follow you.

1341
01:02:42,962 --> 01:02:45,429
-I believe that the murderer
had a way of forcing

1342
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:47,957
her to listen at the right time.

1343
01:02:47,957 --> 01:02:49,455
-You think that a murderer
would deliberately

1344
01:02:49,455 --> 01:02:51,443
invite a witness to his crime?

1345
01:02:51,443 --> 01:02:54,949
-He might arrange to have
her think she was a witness.

1346
01:02:54,949 --> 01:02:59,205
With a piece of
cord, a telephone,

1347
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:01,303
and a radio.

1348
01:03:01,303 --> 01:03:02,482
-I don't understand.

1349
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:05,848
-Now, this radio is a
new remote control model.

1350
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:09,784
Now, let us assume that
a certain radio program

1351
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:12,471
exactly fitted a
given situation.

1352
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:15,418
How easy it would be tune
in the desired station

1353
01:03:15,418 --> 01:03:18,365
at the right time and be
nowhere near the instrument.

1354
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:20,753
-Oh, I see.

1355
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:22,241
You mean that the
crime could have

1356
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:24,009
been committed sometime before.

1357
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:25,288
-Of course.

1358
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:29,284
And by any of our suspects
who had such cast-iron alibis.

1359
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:32,910
Hardway Harry Lockett, for
instance, who planted himself

1360
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:36,436
in Street's office at the
supposed time of the murder.

1361
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:37,995
Any of his friends.

1362
01:03:37,995 --> 01:03:39,253
-Even young Belden?

1363
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:41,231
-Even young Belden.

1364
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:43,259
He was here at 10 o'clock.

1365
01:03:43,259 --> 01:03:44,737
Who knows?

1366
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,933
Perhaps it was his second visit.

1367
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:52,469
-You don't believe that, do you?

1368
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:54,397
-No.

1369
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:58,723
-Nor that any of the
others did it, either.

1370
01:03:58,723 --> 01:04:00,271
-No

1371
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:18,432
-Is that what you were
looking for, Mr. Wong?

1372
01:04:18,432 --> 01:04:20,260
-Yes.

1373
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,949
And you pulled the cord--

1374
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:23,567
-When I went to get the drink.

1375
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,155
-And when you reached
for the cigars--

1376
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:29,621
-I turned off the radio
by remote control.

1377
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:31,189
-Thank you, Mr. Forbes.

1378
01:04:31,189 --> 01:04:33,247
-Keep away from that telephone.

1379
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:33,946
Get over there.

1380
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:46,883
Operator.

1381
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:51,358
-Oh, hello, Captain.

1382
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:52,936
-Hello, is Mr. Forbes in?

1383
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:55,793
-I'll see for you.

1384
01:04:55,793 --> 01:04:58,361
Operator.

1385
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,719
-Mr. Forbes doesn't answer.

1386
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:02,606
-All right, thanks.

1387
01:05:02,606 --> 01:05:03,675
-Why don't you answer that call?

1388
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:08,310
-Oh, that's Mr. Wong.

1389
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,679
He told me not to pay
no attention to it.

1390
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:10,588
- Mr. Wong?
- Yeah.

1391
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:13,725
He's at Miss Serova's apartment
playing with the telephone.

1392
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:15,343
-Well, I hope he's
having a good time.

1393
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:18,000
I'll drop up and see him.

1394
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,059
Playing with a telephone.

1395
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:29,238
-I killed Grady because
he was in the way.

1396
01:05:29,238 --> 01:05:30,837
And Belden because he was
getting ready to talk.

1397
01:05:30,837 --> 01:05:34,043
-Griswold when he recognized
his own program and Tanya Serova

1398
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:35,961
because she knew too much.

1399
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:37,430
-No.

1400
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,448
Because she was leaving
me for a younger man.

1401
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:49,597
-It's you who knows too much.

1402
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:51,076
Wong, this is Street.

1403
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:52,314
-Just a moment, Street.

1404
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,754
-What are you doing
up here, Wong?

1405
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:02,743
-Get 'em up.

1406
01:06:02,743 --> 01:06:04,022
Over there with him.

1407
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,230
-Well, the two of you.

1408
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,739
That makes it perfect.

1409
01:06:19,436 --> 01:06:21,774
-I suppose you'd like
to have us turn around.

1410
01:06:21,774 --> 01:06:23,072
So you could give
it to us in the back

1411
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:24,421
like you gave it to Grady.

1412
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:25,919
-Drop that gun.

1413
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,758
Drop it, I say.

1414
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:32,153
-Nice work, kid.

1415
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,397
-Take him, Wong.

1416
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,946
Oh, Bobbie.

1417
01:06:38,946 --> 01:06:39,645
Bobbie.

1418
01:06:39,645 --> 01:06:41,393
Honey.

1419
01:06:41,393 --> 01:06:42,192
Bobbie.

1420
01:06:42,892 --> 01:06:44,230
-Yes?

1421
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,309
Oh, it's all right, Bessie.

1422
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,267
The experiment's over.

1423
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:49,395
You might get me the
Herald, will you?

1424
01:06:49,395 --> 01:06:51,223
Herald?

1425
01:06:51,223 --> 01:06:54,110
You have a star
reporter on your staff.

1426
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,828
A Miss Roberta Logan?

1427
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:59,105
She has just been instrumental
in the capture of John Forbes,

1428
01:06:59,105 --> 01:07:03,300
confessed murder in the
Dan Grady, Serova case.

1429
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, yes.

1430
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,628
This is a scoop.
