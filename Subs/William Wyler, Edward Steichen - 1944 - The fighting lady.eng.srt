1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:33,796
- Far aloft,
over the Atlantic Seaboard,

4
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:36,610
one find morning in 1943,

5
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,776
an imposing force of Naval air power

6
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,576
proceeds to an important rendezvous.

7
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:45,912
This force is the aircraft
compliment of a new carrier.

8
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,926
Fighters, diver bombers, torpedo bombers.

9
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,996
With the air group
commander leading everyone

10
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:54,146
they are flying out to
sea to join the ship

11
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:57,399
which will be their floating
home and fighting base.

12
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,886
She is one of the many carries

13
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,326
which the American people
have built since Pearl Harbor

14
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:05,409
to destroy the enemy in his
own part of the world far away.

15
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:14,559
And there now is our
base, powerful, serene.

16
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,946
In honor of all American
aircraft carriers,

17
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:21,349
let us call her the Fighting Lady.

18
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,686
Against a good solid wind
with her tail-hooks down,

19
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,576
our planes come into the broad flight deck

20
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,479
of their new home.

21
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,626
In case the plane's hook fails
to catch the arresting gear,

22
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:52,069
there's a series of stout wire barriers.

23
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,576
Number one man on the flight deck just now

24
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,206
is the LSO, the landing signal officer,

25
00:02:58,206 --> 00:02:59,896
always a flyer himself,

26
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,659
like all aviators, he'd
much rather be flying.

27
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,026
Come on in and sit down.

28
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:15,456
The plane is out of the
groove and he waves it off.

29
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:16,796
Come around another time, pilot,

30
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,103
and we'll take you aboard.

31
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:33,426
When planes land they taxi
quickly forward out of the way,

32
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,176
later, they'll have to
be shifted to the stern,

33
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:38,396
and rearranged in proper
position for take off.

34
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,179
This is called respotting the deck.

35
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,656
Here is our skipper, Jocko,

36
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:49,409
a veteran Navy flyer, Annapolis 1917.

37
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,246
He is not impressed by
our earnest efforts,

38
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,296
Nor are the flight deck control officers.

39
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,266
The skipper calls all-hands together

40
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,989
and gives us a piece of his mind.

41
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,856
- We'll never
be ready for combat

42
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,436
unless you flight deck crews

43
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,935
learn right now to work as a team.

44
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:09,396
Don't you men realize that before long

45
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,029
we'll be in dangerous waters?

46
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,839
That's too slow, bear ahead!

47
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,429
Watch out, keep that wing clear!

48
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,006
Get it over to starboard,

49
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:31,146
way over to starboard!

50
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,549
Come on, get the lead outta your pants.

51
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:38,596
Now this is the way your deck should look

52
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,046
when you're ready for action.

53
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:43,906
- Our ship, our Fighting Lady,

54
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,679
is enormous, wonderful and strange to us.

55
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:48,966
From stem to stern,

56
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,606
the entire ship is a honeycomb

57
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:53,760
of watertight and
flame-proof compartments.

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,546
Far below the waterline are engine rooms,

59
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,176
fire rooms, fuel tanks,

60
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,836
magazines packed with enough
assorted high explosives

61
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,639
to blow us all to kingdom come.

62
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:07,816
The hangar deck is like a gigantic tunnel,

63
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:09,496
nearly two city blocks long,

64
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:12,239
and wide enough to house
four freight trains abreast.

65
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,186
It'll take us a week, a month maybe,

66
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,386
to learn our way around.

67
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:27,666
These new surroundings
are as mysterious to us

68
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,369
as they are cold and impersonal.

69
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,576
Our Fighting Lady is like
a huge, floating cave,

70
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,129
noisy and uncomfortable.

71
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:43,044
Elevators as big as a tennis court

72
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:45,269
carry us topside to the flight deck.

73
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,826
The great super-structure
rising a midships

74
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,089
is called the island.

75
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:52,716
This is truly the ship's nerve center,

76
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:54,029
its fighting brain.

77
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:59,236
85% of us who make up the
Fighting Lady's family,

78
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:00,776
are volunteers in this war,

79
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,759
and never been to sea before.

80
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:05,656
We learned our jobs theoretically

81
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,553
in intensive training ashore.

82
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,336
A very short while ago
we were high school boys

83
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:13,626
and college kids, or bank clerks,

84
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,649
or farm hands, or factory workers.

85
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:19,356
Now we are blue jackets or marines,

86
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:21,456
all members of a naval combat team

87
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:23,169
nearly three thousand strong.

88
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,336
In our multitude of new
tasks and duties as a team,

89
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:31,281
we're very green with
curiosity and comradeship,

90
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,669
and the instinct of
self-preservation are great features.

91
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,776
Some of us have to master

92
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,526
the delicate and complicated instruments

93
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:58,626
which control the fire of
our five inch batteries,

94
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,586
the guns that must
defend the Fighting Lady

95
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,879
when enemy dive bombers
and torpedo planes attack.

96
00:07:17,656 --> 00:07:20,056
We train and train to learn our stuff,

97
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,979
and earn our E for efficiency.

98
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,406
The Fighting Lady's destination

99
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,606
is still a closely guarded secret.

100
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:31,856
No one can hide the fact

101
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,706
that we are entering tropical waters.

102
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,116
Our ship seems more friendly
and comfortable now,

103
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,096
we green-horns feel that a suntan

104
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:43,086
will at least make us look
like fighting sailors.

105
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:44,686
Even our mascot, Scrappy,

106
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:46,415
has been at sea longer than most of us.

107
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,426
Some of the mystery that has
been hanging over us is lifted

108
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,620
when we enter the Panama Canal.

109
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,896
There's a lot of
unprofessional nervousness

110
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,386
about whether or not we're too big

111
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:04,236
to get through the locks.

112
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,436
By using lines instead of
fenders we do get through,

113
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:10,326
as the naval constructors
knew all along we would.

114
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:11,159
- Come on, hop aboard,

115
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:11,992
we're going places.

116
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,825
- For two cents I would,

117
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,556
you know anybody who wants to swap?

118
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,916
- Now we stand
down into the Pacific,

119
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,239
and life aboard settles
down into monotony.

120
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,526
Here are our aircraft
pilots, officers all.

121
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:31,196
The ships company call
them the "Glamor Boys",

122
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:34,065
they are the men who fly
and fight our planes.

123
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:37,176
All the efforts of all the
rest of us are concentrated

124
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,186
on putting these people into the air

125
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,586
and getting them back again.

126
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:42,836
Most of us are hiding

127
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,976
a certain amount of
nervousness and anxiety,

128
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,736
for many of us are Johnny-come-lately's.

129
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,256
Reserve officers who only
recently learned to fly

130
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,842
at Corpus Christi in Jacksonville.

131
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:54,506
Others among us are specialists

132
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,656
who trained at Quonset
Point, Rhode Island.

133
00:08:58,046 --> 00:08:59,891
Reserves are called by the regulars,

134
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:02,883
in a friendly way, "90 Day Wonders".

135
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:05,456
In return, the Annapolis regulars

136
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:08,236
are called the "Trade School Boys".

137
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,216
But whether Quonset or Annapolis,

138
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,929
all are bound together in the fraternity,

139
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:14,619
close fellowship, of Navy men.

140
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,396
Among the ships
non-commissioned personnel,

141
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:29,226
almost three thousand blue
jackets and one hundred marines,

142
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,476
the hottest shots of the air crewmen,

143
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:33,289
ariel gunners and radiomen.

144
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,096
These boys and the plane
captains are the partners

145
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:38,669
of the Glamor Boys in the air.

146
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,516
By non-flying blue jackets

147
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:44,593
they are called "zoom
pigeons" or "airedales".

148
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:48,576
Because they receive 50%
extra pay for flying,

149
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:51,553
they're sometimes referred
to as the "Bankroll Boys".

150
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,895
Everybody aboard ship
backs up the flying group,

151
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,960
this requires the efforts
of all manner of people.

152
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,859
Many of the jobs are far from glamorous.

153
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:10,016
All the little tasks and services

154
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,516
you find along Main Street,

155
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,789
must be performed by some
members of our carrier's crew.

156
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,746
Although the Fighting Lady
is a powerful ship of war,

157
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:22,006
she is also a sizable American community,

158
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:23,566
who's population must be supplied

159
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,716
with all the necessities,

160
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:27,099
and some of the comforts of home.

161
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,746
Doc Sorensen, the pharmacist mate

162
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:34,326
is just like a village druggist.

163
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:37,432
And next door is our
hospital called Sick Bay.

164
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,186
There's only a few patients now,

165
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:41,436
but soon it is to be
filled with our wounded.

166
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,566
Men like these that
perform the humble jobs

167
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:48,589
that make life aboard a
carrier more bearable,

168
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,676
the barbers and the cobblers,

169
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,231
are seldom mentioned in communiques,

170
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:57,099
they all have a place
in our fighting team.

171
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:03,026
Weeks pass, now we are
far out into the Pacific,

172
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:05,429
which is a very
considerable body of water.

173
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:11,116
Monotony shuts down on
us between our duties.

174
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:14,239
Guessing where we're bound
is still our chief pastime.

175
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,046
Will we put into Pearl?

176
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:19,316
Are we going to Iron Bottom Bay?

177
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,129
Or maybe even to the Aleutians.

178
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,006
All such gossip and rumor
are called scuttlebutt,

179
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:26,849
or drinking fountain conversation.

180
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:43,536
- Throughout the ship,

181
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,116
men get together in little groups

182
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,876
to take refuge from the heavy burden

183
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:48,763
of waiting for something to happen.

184
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:57,926
And then one day out of nowhere
comes a fast fleet tanker,

185
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,299
and we are refueled at sea.

186
00:12:00,196 --> 00:12:01,396
This tells us something,

187
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,226
this tells us that we
are not going to Pearl,

188
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:07,046
or any other land base
for a long, long time.

189
00:12:16,326 --> 00:12:18,906
Besides our skipper, we
have an admiral aboard,

190
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,069
a sea-dog who's been a naval
flyer for nearly 20 years.

191
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,866
Until now, only these officers have known

192
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:25,816
where we are to go.

193
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:30,946
But now Jocko, our captain,

194
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:32,496
confers with the air group commander

195
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:34,376
and reveals the plan.

196
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:37,776
The Fighting Lady has been
ordered to make a strike.

197
00:12:37,776 --> 00:12:40,376
She will pass through waters
where no carrier task force

198
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,326
has ventured since the
bloody battle of Midway.

199
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,136
Remember, this is 1943,

200
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,186
long before we took the Marshall Islands.

201
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:51,286
Weather studies are made,

202
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,806
and though this is a daily routine,

203
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,386
somehow the whole ship senses

204
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,086
that something is about to happen.

205
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:01,096
Even before the news is
broadcast to all of us,

206
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,649
there's a new tension and
atmosphere of expectancy.

207
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,006
And then we are told.

208
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,966
We have traveled over
7,000 miles from Panama,

209
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,226
so that tomorrow,

210
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,846
August 30th, 1943,

211
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:16,406
we can strike the Jap
base at Marcus Island,

212
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:18,599
deep within the enemy's ring of defenses.

213
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:24,876
The evening before our first strike,

214
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,966
the air group commander
briefs all his pilots

215
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,129
with maps and a model of our target.

216
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:31,516
We are sticking out our necks

217
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:33,356
to within a thousand miles of Tokyo

218
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,956
to divert the Jap's attention
from other American activities

219
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,939
far south and east of Marcus.

220
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:42,306
Those of us who have never
before been in battle,

221
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,736
that's most of us,

222
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:46,426
ask a lot of questions of
those who have seen action.

223
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,776
- Rear seat gunners.

224
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,236
Don't break off until you're
practically on the same course,

225
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:51,736
right astern of the enemy.

226
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:52,996
Then push over fast.

227
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,566
- Outwardly, we try to seem

228
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:55,956
composed and cheerful,

229
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:58,889
but a lots going on inside our minds.

230
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,486
We question our most inner-selves.

231
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,859
What'll it be like?

232
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:05,269
How will we take it?

233
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:07,259
Will we do all right?

234
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:11,506
This is the night when a lot of boys

235
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:12,856
write one more letter home.

236
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:21,116
Among those playing
acey-ducey in the wardroom,

237
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:22,796
is a chubby, 23 year old,

238
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,836
from Eureka Springs, Arkansas,

239
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:28,103
Lieutenant E.T. Stover,
nicknamed "Smokey".

240
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,916
That's he sitting on the far right.

241
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,256
Having flown 50 missions at Guadalcanal,

242
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,206
Smokey has been ordered to take a rest.

243
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,516
He'd much rather be flying.

244
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,296
Before dark on the eve of battle,

245
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,536
our planes are loaded with bombs and gas,

246
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,586
so that each plane will
be in precise position

247
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:49,746
for a speedy take off,

248
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,589
we spot and respot our deck.

249
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:57,976
Now all is perfect,

250
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,219
we will strike at dawn.

251
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,929
And now GQ, general quarters.

252
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,083
Every man on the ship goes
to his battle stations,

253
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,126
a special place on the fighting team.

254
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,746
George the barber, will pass ammunition.

255
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,929
Leo the baker, will be a sky lookout.

256
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:34,426
Frank the tailor is assigned
to a first-aid station.

257
00:15:36,796 --> 00:15:38,966
Pilots are in their ready-rooms.

258
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:41,916
Each squadron, the fighters, the bomber,

259
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,119
torpedo bomber, assemble separately.

260
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:46,836
The flyers get into their flight gear

261
00:15:46,836 --> 00:15:49,269
and receive last-minute
data and instructions.

262
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,046
On the flight deck,

263
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,179
our first battle dawn awaits us.

264
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,899
Our whole ship is on hair-trigger.

265
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:10,986
The Fighting Lady is hardly 100 miles

266
00:16:10,986 --> 00:16:12,789
from the first target of her career.

267
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:15,706
These last few minutes

268
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,456
before the order for our first action

269
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:18,939
are the toughest time of all.

270
00:16:27,456 --> 00:16:29,383
A wise man once said,

271
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:32,126
"War is mostly waiting.".

272
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:33,949
We learn now what that can mean.

273
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:37,193
At last the word comes.

274
00:16:37,193 --> 00:16:38,646
- Pilots man your planes.

275
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:40,876
- Radio room three, Roger.

276
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,544
Pilots man your planes.

277
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:25,596
- The fighters take off first

278
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:28,705
to form cover aloft for
for the other squadrons.

279
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,139
Then the bombers, heavy
laden with destruction.

280
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:44,653
The sun is risen now,

281
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:47,639
and our escorts are alert
for enemy submarines.

282
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:52,646
But the Fighting Lady steams
boldly toward our target,

283
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:55,396
to lessen the distance for
our planes when they return.

284
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,096
The radio plotting room is
the electric eye and ear

285
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:11,746
by which the Fighting
Lady detects and keeps tab

286
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:14,409
on all planes and ships
for miles around us.

287
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:18,266
Smokey, the fighting ace from Arkansas,

288
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,866
has been put in charge of
this room for our big day.

289
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:23,796
Hunched among his assistants,

290
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:28,276
Smokey is like a super quarterback
on a super football team.

291
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:30,809
He is in constant touch
with our entire air group.

292
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:38,396
As our first fighters

293
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:41,246
race in towards Marcus
Island, they stay low,

294
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,709
hoping to escape detection
by the enemy's radar.

295
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,446
Then they climb suddenly and dive,

296
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:52,569
a surprise strafing attack
on the enemy's airstrips.

297
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,397
These red balls floating
up at us so lazily

298
00:18:56,397 --> 00:18:58,269
are anti-aircraft fire.

299
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:00,576
But there's three times as much of it

300
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,456
coming up at us as we can see,

301
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:04,709
because only one shell
in three is a tracer.

302
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:08,066
What look like fiery pollywogs are tracers

303
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,846
from our own wing guns,

304
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:12,296
the ack-ack is much heavier than expected,

305
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,476
but through it we go

306
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:15,559
to knock out enemy bombers on the ground.

307
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:19,186
All through these battle pictures,

308
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,066
realize that we are looking straight down

309
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,476
our own gun barrels.

310
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:24,336
These pictures are taken automatically

311
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:26,609
by the same mechanism
that operates the guns.

312
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:30,196
Pictures even shake to the guns recoil.

313
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:33,229
Our eye is now the very eye
of our fighting airplane.

314
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:46,136
The enemy's picket boats
and supply ships off shore

315
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:47,986
are thoroughly strafed.

316
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,796
No longer will these
craft bring rise and sake

317
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:54,078
and munitions to Marcus.

318
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:07,816
our bombers flying higher,

319
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:09,559
see the island beginning to burn.

320
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:13,956
A moment ago, it looked
like a little jade trinket

321
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,069
in a cobalt sea.

322
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,276
As the fighters and bombers

323
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:25,626
swing victoriously away
from Marcus Island,

324
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:28,406
towering columns of smoke
show the thorough job

325
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:29,499
our boys have done.

326
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,566
Back aboard ship,

327
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,666
Smokey is tracking the flyers with care

328
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,516
to make sure none is missing,

329
00:20:37,516 --> 00:20:38,816
and that no enemy planes

330
00:20:38,816 --> 00:20:41,369
are trying to follow them
out to our Fighting Lady.

331
00:20:55,516 --> 00:20:56,916
As our planes come aboard

332
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,346
there begins an operation
almost as exciting

333
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:00,872
as the attack itself.

334
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:02,986
A ballet after battle.

335
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:05,159
The plane directors as dancing masters.

336
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:08,336
Whirling propellors fill
the scene with danger,

337
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:10,739
but now our crews are trained and adept.

338
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:29,276
The landing signal officer
performs a eloquent adagio

339
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:30,779
on the Fighting Lady's stern.

340
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:34,876
A warning to the rest of the cast

341
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,036
to stay off stage until the limping member

342
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:38,386
can be lead out of the way.

343
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,316
The pilots go below to to report

344
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:09,186
to their combat intelligence officers.

345
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:12,746
They have hot news, good news.

346
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:14,816
They tell what they saw and did,

347
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,986
how many rounds of ammunition they fired,

348
00:22:16,986 --> 00:22:19,649
how many bombs tehey
dropped, what they hit.

349
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,086
What they noticed at the target
that was new or different,

350
00:22:23,086 --> 00:22:25,109
or that may need hitting again.

351
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:27,836
As the reports are added up,

352
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:30,966
and our combat photographers
develop their pictures,

353
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:33,596
the story becomes better and better.

354
00:22:33,596 --> 00:22:37,138
Every single Jap bomber on
Marcus has been destroyed.

355
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:41,316
80% of the shore installations
blasted or set afire.

356
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,146
Hangers, radio stations,

357
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,826
gas dumps, ammunition dumps.

358
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:48,479
Marcus is now a lovely mess.

359
00:22:49,926 --> 00:22:52,656
In the radio plot, Smokey's worried.

360
00:22:52,656 --> 00:22:53,916
There are planes still up there

361
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,416
and he's wondering about them.

362
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:58,594
They're ours though,
delayed by battle damage.

363
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:04,196
Landing a shot-up plane
on the battle carrier

364
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,354
is a crucial test of how well-trained,

365
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,676
how alert, steady,

366
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:09,889
a naval flyer is.

367
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:30,011
The Fighting Lady now has met her enemy.

368
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,416
In the wardroom, the
pilots who this morning

369
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,196
felt new and nervous,

370
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,659
now talk like veterans.

371
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:40,036
We have been baptized by fire
and have survived nicely.

372
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:42,959
We of the Fighting Lady are growing up.

373
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:50,166
The admiral of our taskforce
knows the over-all strategy

374
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,986
of the whole Pacific campaign.

375
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:54,946
To smash straight through
Japan's outer network of islands,

376
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:57,946
recapture the Philippines, and
land on the mainland of Asia.

377
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,556
Thus we will deny Japan supplies

378
00:24:00,556 --> 00:24:02,826
from Maylaya and the Dutch East Indies,

379
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:05,389
and leave her far-flung
island garrisons marooned.

380
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:09,429
Then we will reach out and
really help our ally China.

381
00:24:10,886 --> 00:24:13,793
Months after Marcus, this
campaign is well started.

382
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:17,288
Our carrier task forces
have been in many battles.

383
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,993
And now, early in 1944,

384
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:23,206
the Fighting Lady's target is Kwajalein,

385
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,406
in the Marshall Islands.

386
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,775
These are Jap Zeros,

387
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:30,706
fighter screen being pierced by our planes

388
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:33,376
and planes from eight other carriers,

389
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:36,639
a preparatory to strafing
Kwajalein and bombing it apart.

390
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:41,356
Our fighter pilots improve with practice,

391
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,706
with the confidence that
comes from experience.

392
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:47,959
They estimate their range
by watching their tracers,

393
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:49,856
they hold their fire

394
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,999
until their wing gun
bullets converge 300 yards.

395
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:58,646
They shoot in bursts
instead of in steady streams

396
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:00,899
which heat up the guns
and spend ammunition.

397
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:50,915
We soon have Kwajalein
burning very satisfactorily.

398
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:56,516
After our bombing attacks

399
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:58,906
and heavy shelling buy our surface ships,

400
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:02,706
assault craft filled with
marines and army hit the beaches,

401
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:05,739
and very soon after
that, Kwajalein is ours.

402
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:24,436
Right after Kwajalein,
word comes to our admiral

403
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:27,596
that at Truk, Japan's huge
and secret naval fortress

404
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,583
1,400 miles to the west,

405
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:31,886
there apparently are some heavy units

406
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,419
of the Japanese battle fleet.

407
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:35,916
Perhaps we can surprise them?

408
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:40,026
Again, the Fighting Lady's squadron,

409
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:41,976
and squadrons from other carriers,

410
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,149
take off for combat.

411
00:26:44,386 --> 00:26:45,716
A lot of mouths are dry

412
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:48,709
at the thought of our
target is mighty Truk.

413
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,136
A lot of rear-seat gunner look
back at the Fighting Lady,

414
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:57,876
wondering when and if,

415
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,276
they will ever return to it.

416
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,056
All that we know about Truk,

417
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:12,316
we know from a few photographs
taken by some nervy marines

418
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:14,709
on reconnaissance just 18 days ago.

419
00:27:15,866 --> 00:27:19,046
We hear that it is a complex
of heavily fortified islands

420
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:20,632
surrounded by airstrips,

421
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:24,096
with naval anchorages at
certain spots among the islands.

422
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:27,986
For the next two days,

423
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:30,686
more than 1,000 of our
carrier based planes

424
00:27:30,686 --> 00:27:33,069
are going to sweep in on Truc in relays.

425
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:37,632
The planes appear to
float gently off our bow,

426
00:27:37,632 --> 00:27:41,856
actually their airspeed
is a good 70 knots.

427
00:27:41,856 --> 00:27:42,836
Diving in on Truk,

428
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:45,829
we again turn on our guns and
their synchronized cameras.

429
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,406
Truks defenders are aloft
and we smack them hard.

430
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:19,146
The hearts that were in men's mouths

431
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:20,946
before this strike began,

432
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:23,809
now settle back into place
and are singing once more.

433
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:28,516
There's something really
grand, something historic,

434
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:30,436
about diving in here on this place

435
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:33,186
which Japan has been building
and guarding jealously

436
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:35,799
from all the Japanese eyes for 20 years.

437
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:39,636
They dive right in low
and take a good look

438
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:43,609
at fighter strips, bomber
bases, seaplane ramps.

439
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,953
In an almost vertical dive,

440
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:56,826
the the pilot may black-out
or go blind for a moment,

441
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:59,106
when he pulls up and out at the bottom,

442
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:00,656
but the camera won't black-out.

443
00:29:01,826 --> 00:29:03,926
It cannot see the landing of our own bomb,

444
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:07,656
for we'll be up and away
before that reaches the target,

445
00:29:07,656 --> 00:29:10,256
but it records the hits of
other planes ahead of us.

446
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:52,066
We'd hope to find the Jap fleet here,

447
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:53,409
but most of it's gone.

448
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,196
Some lingering ships,

449
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,816
including some of their
fast-fleet tankers,

450
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:00,699
we find hiding in sheltered coves.

451
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:04,096
The vessels which we are now strafing

452
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,752
are other fleet auxiliaries, rice boats,

453
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:10,489
transports, ammunition ships.

454
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:17,256
With bursts of 50 caliber incendiaries

455
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:18,446
and armor-piercing slugs,

456
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:21,006
we set them on fire, rip them open,

457
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,736
often wide enough to sink.

458
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,286
Strafing ships filled with TNT

459
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:04,219
is not very healthy for
pilots who dive too low,

460
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:07,236
but it's hard to tell who's carrying what

461
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,759
until the big bang comes.

462
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:26,116
Returning to the deck
at 130 miles an hour,

463
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:27,846
with a flap shot away,

464
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:30,559
all the pilot can hope
to save is his own skin.

465
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:34,666
Here comes our new air group commander,

466
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,966
he's had a bit of trouble.

467
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:38,616
His windshield is blotted with blood,

468
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,316
and he has to feel his way aboard.

469
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,676
Strafing at low altitude,

470
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:45,046
he took a 40 millimeter
anti-aircraft burst

471
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,816
right in the face.

472
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:49,899
More than 200 wounds,
and his plane a sieve.

473
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:53,119
He'll live to fly again.

474
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,436
Some planes will not return,

475
00:31:56,436 --> 00:32:00,159
but others come back and
land, somehow, anyhow.

476
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:02,996
Considering the toughness of Truk,

477
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:04,929
our losses are astonishingly light.

478
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:08,609
No time is lost getting casualties below.

479
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:21,056
It's a long way from Truk
to our secret rendezvous

480
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:22,916
in the Marshall Islands,

481
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:25,249
someday it can be told just where this is.

482
00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:28,570
Actually it is a magnificent
new fleet anchorage,

483
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,256
an advanced naval base

484
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:32,706
that we have taken from
the Japs and made secure.

485
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:37,406
Now, for the first time,

486
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:39,466
we who have been operating as separate,

487
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:41,186
relatively small task forces,

488
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:45,236
see assembled the enormous
mass of naval power.

489
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:48,309
Over one million tons of
American fighting steel.

490
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,336
New carriers, new battleships,

491
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,296
new cruisers and fleet
auxiliaries in an amount

492
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:56,656
which Japan could never conceive,

493
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:58,409
let alone produce.

494
00:33:03,136 --> 00:33:05,266
That we are able to maintain supply lines

495
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:07,255
over the vast distances of the Pacific,

496
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,439
is one of the miracles of this war.

497
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:12,826
In the comforting
presence of so much power,

498
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,379
we relax and refresh our
battle-strained nerves.

499
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:35,864
Our ships post office now
does really big business.

500
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:38,239
Letters for us at last, from home.

501
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:41,239
Letters from us to friends and families.

502
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:45,026
Our censors know our collective mood,

503
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:46,789
our central hopes and thoughts.

504
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,716
- The stuff is really
getting out here now.

505
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:58,339
I can't tell you much
about it, but oh boy.

506
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:01,136
- And the more we get,

507
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:03,369
well, the sooner I'll be seeing you.

508
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:09,089
- All hands
are called together.

509
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,426
Our old skipper, Jocko,

510
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:13,246
has been promoted admiral.

511
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:14,969
Our new one's name is Dixy.

512
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:18,286
- Men, as soon as I finish talking,

513
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:19,946
we're getting underway.

514
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:21,706
Our Fighting Lady is now a part

515
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:24,816
of what is designated Task Force 58.

516
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:27,256
As you know, our final destination

517
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:29,116
is a place called Tokyo.

518
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:31,346
We'll have to fight hard to get there,

519
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,936
but when we drop our hooks at Yokohama,

520
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:35,786
I'm going to throw a party,

521
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:38,346
all hands are cordially invited.

522
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:04,716
- Our task forces
are built compactly now

523
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,446
around carriers like ourselves,

524
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,769
with speedy new battlewagons at our side.

525
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:13,396
A carrier's skipper never
leaves the bridge at sea,

526
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,146
because carriers and their planes

527
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,636
are the first to strike the enemy,

528
00:35:16,636 --> 00:35:18,469
or to be struck by him.

529
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:23,576
Our aircraft pilots
are constantly on call.

530
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:26,016
For despite the massive
power spread out around us,

531
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,959
these are still dangerous waters.

532
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:31,236
Our pilots know this all too well,

533
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:34,026
but it doesn't worry them
now because they're seasoned,

534
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:35,049
they know how.

535
00:35:36,376 --> 00:35:37,716
A lot of new faces among us,

536
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:39,306
but most of these men too,

537
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,936
have been in action.

538
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:43,112
At places like Willandia, Milne,

539
00:35:43,112 --> 00:35:45,225
Jalia, Halall,

540
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:48,479
Rabaul, Wake, Mayloelam.

541
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:54,266
Our rear-seat gunners and
radiomen are old hands now.

542
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:55,736
Some of their faces are different too,

543
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,346
because there have been replacements.

544
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,896
A lot of them have been
made commissioned officers.

545
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,516
There's a saying in the navy

546
00:36:06,516 --> 00:36:08,076
that you never learn to love a carrier

547
00:36:08,076 --> 00:36:09,139
until she gets hurt.

548
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:13,326
Well, perhaps we don't really
love our Fighting Lady,

549
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:16,003
but but we've become mighty fond of her.

550
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:18,389
And almost comfortable, almost at home.

551
00:36:24,546 --> 00:36:26,206
Occasionally our ship-board movies

552
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:28,256
bring us that one thing we crave the most,

553
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:31,056
one touch of something utterly American.

554
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,139
One deep breath of home.

555
00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:48,636
Like Jocko, our new skipper Dixy,

556
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:51,446
is an old hell-diving navy pilot.

557
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:52,346
In their battle caps,

558
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:53,426
he and Admiral Mitscher

559
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:55,649
look like big league baseball managers.

560
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:01,256
Northwest we steam,

561
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:02,666
and never before in history,

562
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:05,199
has an ocean borne such
a weigh of naval power.

563
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:10,076
Not a Jutland, not at
Japan's proud post Tsushima,

564
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:13,236
was there anywhere near the
force with which we now assert

565
00:37:13,236 --> 00:37:15,156
that this is our ocean.

566
00:37:15,156 --> 00:37:16,259
This is our air.

567
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:20,072
And we're seeking the Japanese
battle fleet to prove it.

568
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:31,259
With our cruisers,

569
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,196
our biggest new battlewagons present,

570
00:37:34,196 --> 00:37:37,315
we are strong enough to
hope, really to hope,

571
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:39,736
that we may provoke the Japanese fleet

572
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:41,009
into accepting a fight.

573
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:52,679
We're joined by plodding Coast
Guard and navy transports,

574
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:55,089
The marines again?

575
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:57,669
So another amphibious assault is cooking?

576
00:38:04,354 --> 00:38:07,126
Uh oh, our patrols have
spotted an enemy search plane

577
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:08,847
and are after her.

578
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:09,829
She's a big bird.

579
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:15,126
A 20 ton, four motored Kawanishi seaplane.

580
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,713
The kind we call Emilys.

581
00:38:28,216 --> 00:38:30,796
This Emily's a tough old girl.

582
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:32,846
Right now she's screaming for help,

583
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:35,249
and telling Tokyo by radio, where we are.

584
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:38,196
Hellcats are closing in on her.

585
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:53,009
So long, Emily.

586
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:06,046
Now that the enemy knows where we are,

587
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,096
and we know he knows,

588
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,476
our brass hats get together
on final arrangements

589
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:12,739
for what may turn into another Midway.

590
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,996
Our objective, first of many

591
00:39:16,996 --> 00:39:19,796
in our drive through to
the Philippines and China,

592
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:20,879
will be the Marianas.

593
00:39:23,686 --> 00:39:25,136
In battles just ahead of us,

594
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:27,502
we are to make good use
of a multitude weapons,

595
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:29,757
special devices and techniques,

596
00:39:29,757 --> 00:39:32,246
which have been evolved
through the 30 years

597
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,559
since the U.S. Navy first took to the air.

598
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:42,806
Not only did our naval flyers

599
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:45,266
create the aircraft carrier itself,

600
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,998
but it was they that
devised the torpedo plane,

601
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,998
and invented and perfected dive bombing.

602
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:03,916
Disposed about our flight deck

603
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:06,316
so that planes can be quickly armed,

604
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:09,046
are all manner of death-dealing objects.

605
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:12,569
500, 1,000, and 2,000 pound bombs.

606
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,266
We have torpedoes and incendiaries,

607
00:40:16,266 --> 00:40:18,406
and the kind of anti-personnel bombs

608
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:20,223
we call "daisy cutters".

609
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:32,076
Some of our bombs are armor-piercing,

610
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,695
some for fragmentation,

611
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:35,766
others have delayed action fuses

612
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,776
to prolong the effect of our bombardment

613
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:39,626
for hours after we have delivered it.

614
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,666
Here are the new rockets
that pack the same wallop

615
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:46,706
as a three-inch shell.

616
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:47,566
They weigh a little,

617
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,286
and because there isn't much recoil,

618
00:40:49,286 --> 00:40:50,999
they can be fired from planes.

619
00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:53,306
On the eve of battle,

620
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:54,446
we are told to scrub up

621
00:40:54,446 --> 00:40:57,296
to lessen the danger of
infection in case we are wounded.

622
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,556
As well as our bodies,

623
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:09,006
most of us prepare our souls.

624
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,462
Always on the eve of battle,

625
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:22,726
defined services are held in relays,

626
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:24,556
so that every one of our Fighting Lady's

627
00:41:24,556 --> 00:41:27,119
3,000 sons, has a chance to attend.

628
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:46,056
As the eve before battle lengthens,

629
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:47,406
there is the usual waiting.

630
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:51,449
Again we're reminded that
war is mostly waiting.

631
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,226
Because all cooks and bakers

632
00:42:07,226 --> 00:42:08,916
must soon be at their battle stations,

633
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,146
they work all night long

634
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:12,736
preparing a hearty meal of steak and eggs

635
00:42:12,736 --> 00:42:14,609
for our 3 a.m. battle breakfast.

636
00:42:26,346 --> 00:42:28,158
We are being attacked.

637
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:35,316
We are being attacked by
Japanese torpedo planes

638
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:37,169
skimming in after us, wing to water.

639
00:42:47,262 --> 00:42:49,676
All they want is one
hit on our flight deck.

640
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:52,856
We have nearly 90 planes
fueled and loaded with bombs,

641
00:42:52,856 --> 00:42:54,006
ready for the take off.

642
00:43:08,876 --> 00:43:11,339
Each patch of flame is a burning Jap.

643
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:28,786
In this surprise attack,

644
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:32,516
19 Japs are polished off
by our ships batteries.

645
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,319
Not a single carrier is hit.

646
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,210
We have been fortunate,

647
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:39,926
so now commences another major moment

648
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:41,876
in the Fighting Lady's career.

649
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:43,189
Flight quarters sounds.

650
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:48,236
In this modern warfare,

651
00:43:48,236 --> 00:43:50,486
the young plane captains
are to their pilots,

652
00:43:50,486 --> 00:43:53,049
what squires were to
armored knights of old.

653
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:58,651
In this operation, typical
of many more to come,

654
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:02,276
a lot of other Fighting
Lady's will be involved.

655
00:44:02,276 --> 00:44:04,317
Nearly 2,000 carrier based planes,

656
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:07,303
all of them attacking in
air groups, like our own.

657
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:27,706
From now on, we tighten our
belts and steady our hands,

658
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,026
as our navy makes
progressively bigger attacks

659
00:44:30,026 --> 00:44:32,429
nearer and nearer the heart of Japan.

660
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,256
As his post in radio plot,

661
00:44:44,256 --> 00:44:45,956
and tracking down enemy planes,

662
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:48,546
cursing the luck that
keeps him out of the air,

663
00:44:48,546 --> 00:44:52,146
Smokey chaffs at being
grounded on a day like this.

664
00:44:52,146 --> 00:44:54,679
Especially when targets are juicy ones.

665
00:44:56,186 --> 00:44:57,646
All the Jap air bases

666
00:44:57,646 --> 00:45:00,466
and military installations
in the Mariana's,

667
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:04,366
and a special prize package, Guam.

668
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,616
The island that we did not fortify,

669
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,779
but the Japs did.

670
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:11,466
Now comes word that the Japs

671
00:45:11,466 --> 00:45:13,786
have sent strong air
re-enforcements to Tinian,

672
00:45:13,786 --> 00:45:14,909
which flanks Guam.

673
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,577
Again, our synchronized cameras record,

674
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:24,656
as no human eye and memory could record,

675
00:45:24,656 --> 00:45:27,689
just what our guns and
bombs do to the enemy.

676
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:35,286
These pictures enable our air
combat intelligence officers

677
00:45:35,286 --> 00:45:38,469
to assess the damage as
we swoop down upon Tinian.

678
00:46:57,476 --> 00:47:00,296
While our planes return for
more fuel and ammunition,

679
00:47:00,296 --> 00:47:01,849
the surface vessels take over.

680
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,336
A prodigious naval barrage
to prepare the beaches

681
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:07,159
our assault forces are going to hit.

682
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:10,456
Not only our newest,

683
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:14,286
but some of our oldest and
proudest battleships are here.

684
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:16,416
The Colorado, The Tennessee,

685
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,076
and the USS Pennsylvania,

686
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:20,756
flagship of World War I.

687
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:31,396
Winging home to the Fighting Lady,

688
00:47:31,396 --> 00:47:33,326
several of our planes crippled,

689
00:47:33,326 --> 00:47:34,909
make a game attempt to land.

690
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,586
Now is when the landing
signal officer must

691
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:42,053
judge not only the speed,

692
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:45,209
but estimate the battle
damage of planes like these.

693
00:47:56,716 --> 00:47:59,626
And flight deck emergency
crews, fire fighters,

694
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,136
rescue details and medical corpsmen,

695
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:04,209
exhibit almost incredible courage.

696
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:26,866
The pilot of a torpedo
plane has been unable

697
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:29,061
to release his load of incendiaries,

698
00:48:29,061 --> 00:48:31,939
burning thermite is spilling
out at incandescent heat.

699
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:33,976
In the planes tanks

700
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:37,569
remain about 75 gallons
of high-octane gas.

701
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:41,886
The men who brave this
danger to save pilot and crew

702
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,773
deserve every citation they get.

703
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,356
In the ready rooms,

704
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:02,695
intelligence officers
question battle-weary pilots.

705
00:49:02,695 --> 00:49:04,229
What did you see?

706
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:07,254
Any Jap carriers in sight?

707
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:09,929
Are you sure they were
carrier based planes?

708
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:15,686
Then from radio plot
comes uncomfortable news,

709
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,516
torpedo planes and diver bombers

710
00:49:17,516 --> 00:49:19,766
from enemy aircraft
carriers are approaching.

711
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:23,769
All hands, man your battle stations.

712
00:49:25,557 --> 00:49:27,736
To our engine rooms go
orders for flank speed,

713
00:49:27,736 --> 00:49:30,126
which is a few knots
faster than full speed,

714
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:31,969
in case need to take evasive action.

715
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:37,086
All boilers are lighted
to let the Fighting Lady

716
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:39,416
out-do herself if necessary.

717
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:41,413
The engine room people turn on the heat,

718
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:44,589
and the propellor shafts turn
like fate in their alleys.

719
00:49:53,242 --> 00:49:57,742
The Fighting Lady leaps
through the sea, on her guard.

720
00:50:02,696 --> 00:50:04,596
Skipper Dixy gears himself for action,

721
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:06,959
and so does wise old Scrappy.

722
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:13,939
And now here they come.

723
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,516
a Jap Jill, torpedo bomber,

724
00:51:07,516 --> 00:51:10,846
miraculously keeps coming
through our wall of flack.

725
00:51:10,846 --> 00:51:11,886
He's approaching us fast,

726
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:13,569
with a life that must be charmed.

727
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:16,396
Our gunners throw everything they've got,

728
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:17,839
but still she comes.

729
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:22,436
If he ever releases that torpedo...

730
00:51:29,676 --> 00:51:31,283
He missed us.

731
00:51:31,283 --> 00:51:32,566
Either the pilot was already dead,

732
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:33,939
or his release gear jammed.

733
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:39,186
Smokey, the pride of Arkansas
hears about that one,

734
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:40,539
he almost takes off.

735
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:46,397
Now our reconnaissance has
spotted the Japanese task forces.

736
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:49,622
This is the moment we've been
fighting and praying for.

737
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,466
Every plane that can fly,

738
00:51:52,466 --> 00:51:54,966
and every qualified pilot
is ordered into the air.

739
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:59,006
At last, Smokey gets
his chance to fly again.

740
00:51:59,006 --> 00:52:00,628
- Pilots man your planes,

741
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:02,545
pilots man your planes.

742
00:52:29,456 --> 00:52:30,336
- Philippine trade wind

743
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:32,369
is tearing down our flight deck,

744
00:52:33,503 --> 00:52:35,969
our planes scream forward to rise into it.

745
00:52:37,066 --> 00:52:39,066
Our entire air group thunders out

746
00:52:39,066 --> 00:52:40,886
behind the group commandant.

747
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:48,226
Now our fighters run into
a swarm of Jap fighters,

748
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:51,036
mostly Zeroes sent up
to intercept our attack

749
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:52,865
on the Japanese fleet.

750
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:55,086
A mad ariel scramble begins,

751
00:52:55,086 --> 00:52:56,706
which the boys to this day,

752
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,299
still call the Mariana's turkey shoot.

753
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:04,966
369 Jap planes are shot
down in this single day,

754
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:06,539
to our loss of 22.

755
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,516
Japanese plane makers have sacrificed

756
00:53:12,516 --> 00:53:15,046
strength and firepower for agility,

757
00:53:15,046 --> 00:53:18,126
their planes disintegrate
quickly when you hit them.

758
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:20,586
They have no armor plate, as ours have,

759
00:53:20,586 --> 00:53:22,436
nor are their gas tanks self-sealing.

760
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:32,566
These little monkeys are fancy flyers,

761
00:53:32,566 --> 00:53:34,716
they think aerobatics can win dogfights,

762
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:39,169
whereas we believe in smooth
flying and careful shooting.

763
00:54:52,216 --> 00:54:54,456
And now at last,

764
00:54:54,456 --> 00:54:57,566
through a late afternoon
haze from high altitude,

765
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,316
our air combat group sights

766
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:02,356
the Imperial Japanese Battle Fleet.

767
00:55:02,356 --> 00:55:03,906
These are the first pictures ever taken

768
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:06,469
of a great enemy naval
formation like this.

769
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:15,966
There it is,

770
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:17,726
that imperial fleet.

771
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:21,766
Sprawling about below us
in violent evasive action.

772
00:55:21,766 --> 00:55:23,583
Us looking down on them,

773
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,819
in the seas they think they own.

774
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:30,386
Some of these Japanese
ships are scampering away

775
00:55:30,386 --> 00:55:31,869
at better than 40 knots.

776
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,036
When you bore straight down on them,

777
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:36,939
they twist, squirm.

778
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:00,836
We engage a big destroyer at the bow,

779
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:03,006
hoping to shoot out his bridge.

780
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:04,649
And he shoots back plenty.

781
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:13,566
Let's go down after that cruiser,

782
00:56:13,566 --> 00:56:16,239
he answers us emphatically
from a forward turret.

783
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:42,826
Now a 25,000 ton Jap carrier

784
00:56:42,826 --> 00:56:45,296
of the Hiyo Taiho class
is going to get it.

785
00:56:45,296 --> 00:56:46,516
Watch 5:00 in the camera,

786
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,616
the lower right hand corner of the screen.

787
00:56:49,816 --> 00:56:52,819
This big flat-top gets it
where the turkey got the ax.

788
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:15,456
When you touch off some of these babies,

789
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:16,593
just watch this one.

790
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:23,989
And now we come home from the
Battle of the Philippine Sea.

791
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:28,389
17 Jap warships have been
sunk or severely damaged.

792
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,496
Several of our returning
planes have been badly shot up.

793
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:39,266
A dive bomber comes in out of gas.

794
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:40,366
He pulls off to starboard,

795
00:57:40,366 --> 00:57:42,646
but noses-over because
his wheels are down.

796
00:57:59,286 --> 00:58:02,079
This pilot has 73 holes in his plane,

797
00:58:02,976 --> 00:58:04,919
and his leg almost shot away.

798
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:14,336
To clear the deck for
other planes, number 30,

799
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:16,376
badly damaged, is jettisoned.

800
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:17,326
Given the deep six.

801
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:27,099
Watch carefully, this man's
controls are all but shot away.

802
00:58:40,196 --> 00:58:42,089
He steps out of it, smiling.

803
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:49,009
And now it is time to paint up the scores.

804
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:53,406
On this fine morning, just a
year after being commissioned,

805
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:57,369
the Fighting Lady is beginning
to look like a stamp album.

806
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,076
She has done her share,

807
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:04,666
amassing Task Force 58's grand total

808
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,426
of 757 Jap aircraft destroyed,

809
00:59:08,426 --> 00:59:09,989
in a two-week turkey shoot.

810
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:21,736
But there's another score to add up,

811
00:59:21,736 --> 00:59:22,929
our own casualties.

812
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:27,716
Quite a few faces are no longer
with us on the Fighting Lady

813
00:59:29,156 --> 00:59:32,436
among them, Lieutenant Commander Upson,

814
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:34,069
skipper of our torpedo squadron.

815
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:37,016
Lieutenant Pappy Convit,

816
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:40,189
Lieutenant John Mehan,

817
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,366
and that fighting as gentleman,

818
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:46,689
Lieutenant Smokey Stover,

819
00:59:48,116 --> 00:59:49,599
yeah, Smokey's missing too.

820
00:59:56,066 --> 00:59:58,479
Salute them, under their country's flag,

821
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:03,139
for they were brave, they were gallant.

822
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:06,426
Others will come forward
to take their places,

823
01:00:08,198 --> 01:00:10,266
but the battles we have
fought on the seas,

824
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:11,756
and in the sky,

825
01:00:11,756 --> 01:00:12,906
are only the beginning.

826
01:00:15,026 --> 01:00:18,276
Still hungry for battle
will steam our carrier,

827
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:21,969
serene, powerful, unafraid.

828
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:28,106
She and her planes will come
home again someday, God grant,

829
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:30,429
but not until the bitter, glorious end.

830
01:00:32,056 --> 01:00:36,489
For she is, and we salute
her, the Fighting Lady.
