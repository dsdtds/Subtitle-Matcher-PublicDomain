1
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:20,609
At the next intersection,
why don't you turn south?

2
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:24,341
Chocolate Mountains were east
last time we headed that way.

3
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:27,580
Who needs the mountains?
Head for San Felipe.

4
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,101
There's nothing to do
in San Felipe but fish.

5
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,547
Well...

6
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,448
That was the idea, wasn't it?

7
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,625
Yeah, I guess so.

8
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:42,283
We might just pick up a drink in Mexicale.

9
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:46,780
- Remember Floribel at the Alhambra Club?
- Yeah.

10
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:50,171
She's probably dead by now.
It was a long time ago.

11
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:53,371
Yeah. Poor old Floribel.

12
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,691
Well, there's no harm
in drinking a toast to her.

13
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,991
Well, okay.

14
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:05,551
Except for the war, this is my first time
away from Maudie and the kids.

15
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:10,467
- D'you wanna turn back?
- No, no. We've come this far.

16
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,405
Mexicale's beginning to sound good.

17
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,435
Guess maybes.

18
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,274
I remember that joint.

19
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,267
Bienvenidos, caballeros!
Bienvenidos a Mexico...

20
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:05,462
This is the place, señores, come in.

21
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:09,301
Juanita's starting her famous fan dance.
You're just in time.

22
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:13,352
We might as well take a look.
Hey, Gil! Gil?

23
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,490
Sorry, friend, no sale.

24
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:29,038
Oh, well. San Felipe, here we come.

25
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,593
- Out of gas?
- Yeah.

26
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:51,163
Hop in.

27
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,750
We're going to San Felipe, you can
pick up gas there and hitch a ride back.

28
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,924
- Waiting out there long?
- Yeah.

29
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:13,627
Light me a cigarette.

30
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,579
Smoke?

31
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,576
No.

32
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:25,238
What are you doing, rolling 'em?

33
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,234
Face front.

34
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,158
And keep driving.

35
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,234
Sure, I'm Emmet Myers.

36
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,251
Do what I tell you, and no fast moves.

37
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:43,351
A lot of dead heroes back there got nervous.

38
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:50,156
From now on, when you're driving,
keep both hands high on that wheel.

39
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:53,033
You, keep one hand on the top of this seat,

40
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,920
the other hand high on that window.

41
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,715
All right. Now turn off
the next side road we come to.

42
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,832
Pull up.

43
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:23,026
Open the glove compartment.

44
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:29,701
What's the box?

45
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:32,595
- Cartridges, 22s.
- Give 'em to me.

46
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,928
Close it.

47
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,700
Now this is how we get out, after this.

48
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,700
First, give me the keys.

49
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,702
Now we oughta
get out the same side, this one.

50
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,845
I get out first, then you.

51
00:08:56,945 --> 00:09:00,565
Stand away from the car. And then you.

52
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:02,958
Let's go.

53
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:12,468
Drop your jackets around your elbows.

54
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,356
Turn around.

55
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:29,710
We're gonna open the trunk. Move.

56
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,012
Pull your jackets up.

57
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,745
You, open the trunk.

58
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:45,335
Both of you, keep your hands on the lid.

59
00:09:48,987 --> 00:09:50,863
Throw me the keys.

60
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,480
Now get the blankets.

61
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,496
You'd never make it!

62
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,997
Get the groceries, you.

63
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:05,705
- Whose gun is that?
- Mine.

64
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,505
- Do you like to shoot?
- Yeah.

65
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:13,517
So do I. So I'm warning you,
don't try anything smart with me.

66
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,599
Move!

67
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,461
I told you my name. What's yours?

68
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:06,314
Mine's Gilbert Bowen. He's Roy Collins.

69
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,492
What do you do for a living?

70
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:12,148
I'm a draughtsman. He runs a garage.

71
00:11:12,248 --> 00:11:14,364
That makes you smarter.

72
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,790
Or does it?

73
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,320
You're lucky. It hit an empty chamber.
I used it a while back.

74
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:28,748
No fast moves!
The last guy made that mistake.

75
00:11:58,032 --> 00:12:00,309
When are you due back?

76
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:03,141
No particular time.

77
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:06,542
We told our wives to expect us home
when we got there.

78
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:10,060
You got wives, huh? Any kids?

79
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,172
I have.

80
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:15,472
Just keep thinking how nice
it'll be to see 'em again.

81
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,603
There's a checkpoint.
Slow down. No talking.

82
00:12:23,703 --> 00:12:26,282
If I give you the word, step on it.

83
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:58,283
This car rides pretty good.

84
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:01,590
When I get where I'm going,
I think I'll sell it.

85
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,447
Where are we going?

86
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:09,676
Pull in at the next pump.
We'll fill up and get a road map.

87
00:13:10,116 --> 00:13:12,152
I got an idea.

88
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:15,066
A pretty good one.

89
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,767
- Aquí estás, señor.
- Gracias.

90
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:38,522
- Speak English, you.
- He doesn't understand English.

91
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,023
I don't understand Mexican.

92
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,123
Never mind the change, let's get out of here.

93
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:48,961
Loco!

94
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,785
Gimme the map.

95
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,763
Take the first side road we come to.

96
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:33,105
Pull up.

97
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:38,589
Keys.

98
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,651
All right, now get out like I told you.

99
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:52,004
Here, you're the smart guy.
Spread the map out on the hood.

100
00:14:56,351 --> 00:15:00,702
Get your hands up on the car.
Look for a town called Santa Rosalia.

101
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,296
How far is it?

102
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:09,329
- About 500 miles.
- Is it on the Gulf of California?

103
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:13,329
- Yeah.
- Say anything about a ferry across the Gulf?

104
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,452
Friday.

105
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,284
Not bad.

106
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:21,421
We're loaded with time.

107
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,157
We can make that easy.

108
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:31,435
After that, I won't need you guys any more.

109
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,458
I guess we won't be having rabbit for dinner.

110
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,943
I wasn't trying.

111
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,524
Collins.

112
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:51,648
Put the can on that rock there.

113
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,677
Gimme the map.

114
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:08,831
Not that one! The other one.

115
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,653
That's it.

116
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:17,792
All right, Collins.
Put the can back on the rock.

117
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:29,636
Don't forget, this is loaded too.
You try. Let's see how good you are.

118
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,595
Go ahead.

119
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,991
Not bad.

120
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,045
Collins.

121
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,611
Pick up the can.

122
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:55,575
Take it onto that point there.

123
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,610
If you don't, I'll let Bowen have it.

124
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,206
Onto the point, that's right.

125
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:04,492
Further.

126
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:13,294
Now hold it up. You won't get hurt,
your buddy's good with guns.

127
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:18,752
- You're crazy! I won't do it.
- It's just a game. Go ahead.

128
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,933
Collins, hold it closer to you.

129
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:27,197
What's the matter, are you scared?
Hold it closer.

130
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:30,464
You want me to try?
I might miss this time.

131
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,491
Shoot.

132
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:07,418
Come on Gil, get going.

133
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,180
Nervous? Relax.

134
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:20,674
All right, Collins, come on in.

135
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:22,056
Fun's over.

136
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:28,514
You guys worked up quite a sweat.

137
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,934
Collins.

138
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:58,524
- Collins!
- What do you want?

139
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,963
- Turn on the radio.
- Why bother?

140
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:05,983
- All you get is Mexican commercials.
- Never mind. Turn it on.

141
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:17,947
- Get something else.
- Like what?

142
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:21,247
One of those news guys from the States.

143
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:29,092
Scheduled for 10am at the White House.

144
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:33,687
On the crime front, the police of 9 western
states, from Washington in the north

145
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,626
to Colorado and Utah in the east,

146
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,980
have been alerted to keep a continue search

147
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,880
for Kansas desperado, Emmet Myers.

148
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,777
Reports have placed the killer in Florida,
Detroit and Seattle,

149
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:50,825
although the police have discounted
most of these. His latest victim,

150
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,597
William Johnson, a salesman
from Portland, Oregon,

151
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:58,336
was found late yesterday
in Imperial County, California.

152
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:02,712
The victim's car, possibly with Myers
in it, has not yet been found.

153
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:06,914
- The United Nations...
- Shut it off.

154
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:11,400
They're not even close!

155
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,918
You guys don't have to worry.

156
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:16,015
Not yet.

157
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,739
You can start sweating
when they put me in this car...

158
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,939
If they ever do.

159
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:29,361
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
Sam Hayes reporting.

160
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,300
At the top of the news tonight
there's a report

161
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,049
that Hitch-hike murderer,
Emmet Myers, is still at large.

162
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,049
Yesterday, the devil thumbed another ride

163
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:41,018
and William Johnson of Portland
asked him to hop in. Now, he is dead.

164
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:42,962
In an all-out effort to apprehend Myers,

165
00:20:43,062 --> 00:20:46,337
the police have set up roadblocks
on all major highways of the western states,

166
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,976
and all border stations
are being closely watched.

167
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:53,011
Myers is slight, 28 years of age,
is wearing a dark shirt,

168
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,950
dark grey trousers
and a black leather jacket.

169
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,882
His right eyelid is partially paralysed.

170
00:20:57,982 --> 00:21:00,083
If you are in possession of any information

171
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,221
regarding the whereabouts of this individual,

172
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,555
please communicate
with your nearest office of police

173
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:07,855
or office of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

174
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,269
Pull up.

175
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,056
Keys.

176
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:32,417
Out.

177
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,421
Move.

178
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:55,581
Each of you take one.

179
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,617
Get around the car.

180
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:07,632
We'll camp here tonight.

181
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,216
I know what you're thinking, Collins.

182
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:23,101
You haven't got a chance.

183
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,267
You guys are gonna die, that's all.
It's just a question of when.

184
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:34,908
Santa Rosalia, that's the end of the line.

185
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:38,296
If the cops find out we're together

186
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,515
or if you try to cross me up...

187
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:53,368
You know, you make
pretty good targets from where I sit.

188
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,554
Anyway, you couldn't tell
if I was awake or asleep.

189
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:02,001
I've one bum eye.

190
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:04,943
It won't stay closed.

191
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,789
Pretty good, huh?

192
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:15,039
We're getting out here and buy some grub.

193
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:17,078
We get out of the car like usual.

194
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:19,692
You guys go in the store ahead of me.

195
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,531
No Mexican. I'm talking to you.

196
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:26,447
When he tells you how much, you pay.
Is that clear?

197
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:29,722
One other thing.
I'll have my hand in my pocket.

198
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:33,557
So far, my record in Mexico's clean,
I wanna keep it that way.

199
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:35,467
Let's go.

200
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:45,227
Buenos días, señores.

201
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,805
Buenos días, señores. Provisiones?

202
00:25:01,905 --> 00:25:05,481
Tengo un gran surtido de frutas y legumbres

203
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:07,455
al mismo precio que existen en Tijuana.

204
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:08,956
What did he say about Tijuana?

205
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:11,994
He says their prices
are about the same as in Tijuana.

206
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,571
Never mind the kid.

207
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:18,550
- What do you want?
- Some beans and stuff.

208
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,550
And tomato soup. I like that.
Get four cans.

209
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:26,816
He wants four cans of beans
and tomato soup, three cans of chilli.

210
00:25:27,397 --> 00:25:29,649
It's no use. He doesn't
understand English.

211
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:34,649
You're not talking Mexican. Take
the cans. Give them to Collins.

212
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,808
I can take some more.

213
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,330
Go on, load it up.

214
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:02,716
That'll hold us. Pay him.

215
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:07,591
Quince pesos, diez centavos, señor.

216
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:18,834
Dame una manzana. Dame una manzana.

217
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:21,436
Dame una manzana.

218
00:26:24,428 --> 00:26:26,672
Get her away from me.

219
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:31,296
Put the kid down. Let's get
outta here. Come on, Collins.

220
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:34,496
Hasta luego señores. Muchas gracias.

221
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:40,464
Vaya usted con Dios.

222
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:42,943
- What did you say to her?
- You wouldn't understand.

223
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:45,343
What did you say to her?

224
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:49,843
I said, "Go you with God, little one".

225
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,114
Get in.

226
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,409
Hey, mister.

227
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:17,350
You live in El Centro. I live there
some time. Nice place, huh?

228
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:31,339
Where'd you get the watch, Bowen?

229
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,282
My wife gave it to me.

230
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:36,295
Throw it over here.

231
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:44,624
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to throw it over here.

232
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:06,254
I had a watch like this once, when I was 17.

233
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:09,571
Nobody gave it to me.

234
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:11,387
I took it.

235
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:16,523
I knocked off a broken-down
jewellery store outside of Tulsa.

236
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:19,884
It was a cinch.

237
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:23,872
You guys are soft.

238
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:29,385
You know what makes you that way?

239
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:33,102
You're up to your necks in IOUs.

240
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:36,980
You're suckers.

241
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,944
You're scared to get out on your own.

242
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,099
You always had it good, so you're soft.

243
00:29:44,838 --> 00:29:46,965
Well, not me.

244
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:50,518
Nobody ever gave me anything.

245
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:53,297
So I don't owe nobody.

246
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:57,732
My folks were duff.

247
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,487
When I was born,
they took one look at this...

248
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:03,526
puss of mine and told me to get lost.

249
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:07,729
I didn't need 'em.
I didn't need any of em.

250
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,355
I got what I wanted my own way.

251
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,913
When you get the know-how
and a few bucks in your pocket,

252
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:19,913
you can buy anything or... anybody.

253
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:26,349
Especially if they're at the point
of a gun. That really scares 'em.

254
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:29,794
You ever been at the other end of a gun?

255
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,695
No. And I never will be.

256
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:40,288
I'm gonna listen to the news.

257
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:58,483
Turn it up.
We'd like to hear what's going on.

258
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:03,683
You just get the grub ready.
Anything interesting, I'll let you know.

259
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:09,666
We've got to raise the hood
and put that radio out of commission.

260
00:31:10,306 --> 00:31:13,203
When he finds out they're looking
for us together, we're through.

261
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:18,676
- Never mind the radio. We gotta get him.
- You can't beat him that way.

262
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,370
Give him one good reason and he'll kill us.

263
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,009
We gotta take the chance.

264
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:26,742
As long as he needs us, we'll stay alive.

265
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,378
When he's ready to jump us,
we'll jump him. Not before.

266
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:32,900
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

267
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,525
All right, now.

268
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,474
They've found Johnson's car.

269
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,767
They know I'm in Mexico.

270
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:54,432
And they're looking for you, too,
in the Chocolate Mountains.

271
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:57,493
Where are the Chocolate Mountains?

272
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:01,014
- In Arizona, near home.
- Not in Mexico?

273
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:02,635
No.

274
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:07,647
Well, what d'you know?

275
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,787
That's where you told your wives
you were going, uh?

276
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,588
Then you came to Mexico.

277
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:18,083
What for?

278
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,121
Dames?

279
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:24,778
You boys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

280
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:28,774
Causing all that trouble, telling lies.

281
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:34,087
You've got everybody looking
for you in them mountains.

282
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,728
- I told you, turn the radio on.
- I did.

283
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,422
It takes time to warm up.

284
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,112
Try another station.

285
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:02,673
- Stop it. Stop it!
- I can't. I gotta pull up and disconnect it.

286
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,767
Then pull up!

287
00:33:16,715 --> 00:33:20,263
Come on, raise the hood.
And keep your hands on it.

288
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:25,626
Come on, Collins, get to work.

289
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,164
Get the right one the first time.

290
00:33:29,903 --> 00:33:32,224
Don't pull the radio wire!

291
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,390
Faster, faster!
I thought you were a mechanic.

292
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,283
I'm going as fast as I can.

293
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,686
Watch it.

294
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,849
Come on.

295
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:25,158
Throw the tools in the back.

296
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,475
The radio, remember? Make it work.

297
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:49,014
I can't.

298
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,525
Pull up.

299
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:57,123
So you did bust it, Collins.

300
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,166
Cut it out! He didn't do it.
It's the static in the hills.

301
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,726
The stations aren't strong enough
in the daytime, tonight it'll work.

302
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:08,426
Tonight it'd better. Take the wheel.

303
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:13,775
Now, in Punta Prieta,

304
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,675
in August 7th, three Americans stopped

305
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:20,514
for provisions at a store
owned by José Andrade.

306
00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:24,881
Andrade gave a description of Myers
as being one of them.

307
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:28,475
Another witness stated
that three men left the store

308
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:32,650
and drove away in a green sedan
bearing the same plates.

309
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,186
This confirms our theory that Collins
and Bowen are with him.

310
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:40,125
He seems to be heading south,
staying clear of main highways.

311
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:43,815
Exactly. To the west,
this is more or less barren

312
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:46,254
and would afford no means of escape.

313
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:51,690
His most logical move would be Santa Rosalia.

314
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,573
Then Guaymas.

315
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:00,863
Make sure that fire's out.
Pour the coffee on it.

316
00:36:02,636 --> 00:36:04,618
Get down!

317
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:17,417
I've gotta get a closer look at that car.
On your feet.

318
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:21,795
Through there.
At the other end, lie flat. Get going!

319
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:59,487
- Get a move on!
- Are you trying to wreck it?

320
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,587
Drive like I tell you.

321
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:23,397
Out!

322
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:32,269
- What did I tell you?
- Shut up! Get that spare tyre out. Move!

323
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:55,725
Keep working. Keep your traps shut,
no matter what. I'll be watching.

324
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:10,206
Buenos días, señores.

325
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:14,006
Son Americanos? Do you need any help?

326
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:19,007
Que raro, no me contestan. Bueno, vámos!

327
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,762
The search for Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins,

328
00:38:26,862 --> 00:38:30,400
believed to have been last seen
with Emmet Myers, mass killer,

329
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,689
is being stepped up by the hour.

330
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:35,790
Helicopters are working in shifts,
scouring the entire area

331
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,728
from El Centro south
to the Gulf of California.

332
00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:41,562
The planes are maintaining
close liaison with the ground,

333
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:44,101
reporting isolated cars and campers.

334
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:48,945
The Mexican police have now joined
this strange race against death.

335
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,480
Hold it right there.

336
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:12,318
Around.

337
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,374
Break the lock.

338
00:41:47,743 --> 00:41:50,568
Okay, one of you on the pump.

339
00:42:38,386 --> 00:42:43,265
"Maudie and Gilbert Bowen".

340
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:47,266
Mayo 12 del '41.

341
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,328
Sí, sí, pronto.

342
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:54,994
Now, as you will notice,
when interrogated at the road block,

343
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:57,538
the man and his wife
were very definite in their statement

344
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:01,577
that they only saw two men.
This was below El Arco.

345
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:04,714
There is a point, however,
which we feel is of importance.

346
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:08,346
The couple stated that the behaviour
of the men seemed strange.

347
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:10,385
That they refused to talk to them.

348
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:16,001
It's possible that Myers my have
been concealed nearby, covering them.

349
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:18,150
We'll consider that possibility.

350
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,968
Now, on the assumption that Myers
is listening to the radio,

351
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:24,207
we're issuing these broadcasts in the state,

352
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:26,692
containing false information
as to his whereabouts

353
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,793
and not connecting the two men with him.

354
00:43:28,893 --> 00:43:32,693
We'd appreciate your cooperation
and following the same procedure.

355
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,270
- This ought to be the main highway.
- It isn't.

356
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,910
- What do you mean?
- Looks like an abandoned airstrip.

357
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,310
It's okay for tonight. Get over there.

358
00:44:07,026 --> 00:44:10,051
- No, you're wrong, you're wrong!
- It's no use to try to talk me out of it.

359
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:12,090
- Tonight I'm gonna chance it.
- You're out of your mind!

360
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,165
I've played it your way long enough.
From now on we're each on our own.

361
00:44:15,265 --> 00:44:17,104
It's no good, we've got to stay together.

362
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:20,269
I've got a break I'm gonna take it,
you do whatever you want...

363
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,089
Across the runway, there's trees.

364
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:24,685
Keep going!

365
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:44,715
- You guys are really dumb.
- Why, you dirty...

366
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:49,326
You thought I was asleep, huh?

367
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,827
You're beginning to get ideas...

368
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,227
I don't like that.

369
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,741
Load him in the car.

370
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:01,060
Your buddy's all washed up for tonight.

371
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:43,323
Over there.

372
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:47,023
Move!

373
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,018
You, Collins, throw a rock down that shaft.

374
00:48:16,984 --> 00:48:19,129
Nice and deep.

375
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:30,999
This is fine.

376
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:33,434
Cut it out! If you're gonna kill us,
do it and get it over with.

377
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:36,138
I thought you never killed without a reason.

378
00:48:36,238 --> 00:48:40,274
Go get the rest of the canned goods
out of the car.

379
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:43,074
We'll have a real good meal.

380
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:25,174
Save 'em for the next guy that picks you up.

381
00:49:26,946 --> 00:49:29,185
Anything you say.

382
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:32,178
We interrupt this hour of music
to bring you a flash bulletin.

383
00:49:32,278 --> 00:49:36,113
The Californian and Mexican police
have abandoned their theory

384
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:37,907
that Emmet Myers is connected

385
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:42,111
with the disappearance
of Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins.

386
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:46,443
They have been missing since last Sunday,
supposedly on a fishing trip.

387
00:49:46,543 --> 00:49:48,797
The police of both sides
of the border now feel

388
00:49:48,897 --> 00:49:50,698
that Myers is travelling alone

389
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,999
and has apparently abandoned his intention

390
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:57,199
of seeking escape by way of Santa Rosalia.

391
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:04,035
What d'you know?!

392
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:07,035
This kind of changes my plans.

393
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:11,452
Looks like you and me
are going fishing after all.

394
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:17,211
On your feet. Back to the car. Let's go.

395
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,523
We're not going anyplace.

396
00:50:21,663 --> 00:50:23,427
Stand up!

397
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:37,556
- What did you do to it?
- There's a big hole in that crankcase.

398
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,623
All right, we'll walk.

399
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:51,008
Just what that sore ankle of yours needs,
Collins, a nice, long hike.

400
00:50:58,172 --> 00:50:59,956
Get up!

401
00:51:04,272 --> 00:51:07,809
Now get the fishing gear
out of the back. Move!

402
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:43,379
Stay with it.
He'll never leave you out here alive.

403
00:51:43,479 --> 00:51:46,298
- Yeah.
- Cut the gab.

404
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,097
Get down!

405
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,150
Let's get going.

406
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:20,610
Maybe we'll have to leave you here.

407
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:23,211
Too bad.

408
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:29,277
Come on, Roy, try.

409
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:31,517
Here we are! Here we are!

410
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:34,182
Can't you see us?

411
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:39,368
Look! Here we are! Down here.

412
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:43,170
Oh, please, God! Hear me!

413
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,530
Hear me!

414
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,118
Come back! Come back.

415
00:53:57,745 --> 00:54:01,809
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's praying?

416
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,483
Get under the bridge, quick!

417
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:35,989
Relax.

418
00:55:57,205 --> 00:56:00,624
Go ahead if you can stand that filthy stuff.

419
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:19,777
You know, Collins?
You're just about my size.

420
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:23,295
Put you in a black shirt and dark pants...

421
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:25,895
with a leather jacket...

422
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,551
you'd look just like Emmet Myers,

423
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:32,431
to anyone who never saw him.

424
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:36,243
And nobody in Santa Rosalia ever saw him.

425
00:56:38,074 --> 00:56:40,040
Let's change.

426
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,808
Get up on the bank and take your clothes off.

427
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,305
Come on, get up!

428
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:28,883
- Looks great, doesn't it?
- You won't be there long.

429
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:33,374
Collins! There are cops down there.
In those clothes, they might shoot you.

430
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:36,531
That'd solve your problems, wouldn't it?

431
00:58:36,631 --> 00:58:39,970
Not if they found they made a mistake.

432
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:42,963
We'll hit a joint on the outskirts.

433
00:58:43,063 --> 00:58:47,163
I might even buy you boys a beer.
Get moving.

434
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:58,945
- Buenas tardes, señores.
- Buenas tardes. Give us three beers.

435
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:01,982
Yo no hablo Inglés.

436
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:04,656
He doesn't speak English.

437
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:07,237
- Tres cervezas.
- Sí, sí.

438
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:10,255
When I want you to talk Mex, I'll tell you.

439
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:14,255
Sit down, Collins. Rest your sore foot.

440
00:59:17,574 --> 00:59:20,724
You can talk it now.
Ask about the ferry to Guaymas.

441
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:25,960
I'll be watching his face.
If he looks frightened, I shoot.

442
00:59:27,061 --> 00:59:29,461
Cuándo sale el chalana para Guaymas?

443
00:59:30,662 --> 00:59:33,844
Los martes y viernes a las 9 de la noche

444
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:36,802
Friday, that's today,
and Tuesday, 9 o'clock.

445
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:40,667
- Ask him where we catch it.
- Dónde puedo embarcar?

446
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:43,268
En el muelle.
Pero ahora no pueden embarcarse,

447
00:59:43,368 --> 00:59:47,268
porque el mes pasado se quemó
y lo están reparando en Guaymas.

448
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:54,643
You're out of luck. The ferry burned up.
It's being repaired in Guaymas.

449
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,876
You're lying.

450
00:59:57,416 --> 00:59:59,395
Ask if he knows anyone who speaks English.

451
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,395
Yo no hablo bien español, no comprendo.

452
01:00:04,596 --> 01:00:06,297
Usted no habla Inglés?

453
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:10,120
Yo no, pero mi primo José, sí.
Venga conmigo.

454
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,955
He says his cousin speaks English,
follow him.

455
01:00:13,055 --> 01:00:14,152
Up.

456
01:00:14,255 --> 01:00:17,955
José! Levántate, despierta!

457
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,297
- José, José, despierta!
- Que pasó?

458
01:00:23,397 --> 01:00:26,097
Estos americanos quieren hablar contigo.

459
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:31,998
Los dejo aquí con mi primo.
Si algo necesitan... confianza.

460
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,289
What can I do for you?

461
01:00:38,389 --> 01:00:40,661
We wanna find out about the ferry to Guaymas.

462
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:42,961
You wanna go fishing?

463
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:47,476
Too bad. No ferry more for
the next two months maybe.

464
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:49,776
- She burned up.
- Thank you.

465
01:00:50,015 --> 01:00:55,203
Fishing is good here. Not as good
as Guaymas or La Paz, but okay.

466
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:58,581
- You have motor boat?
- You know someone who has a boat?

467
01:00:58,681 --> 01:01:03,936
Sure, sure. My friend Jaime,
he have one. Motor runs good.

468
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:06,768
- How do we get to this Jaime?
- In the mine, where he works.

469
01:01:06,868 --> 01:01:09,669
- Let's go.
- He's not finished until six.

470
01:01:10,073 --> 01:01:13,669
- I'll fix it for you tomorrow morning.
- I wanna go now.

471
01:01:14,646 --> 01:01:18,143
- At six, then.
- By the time he gets the boat ready,

472
01:01:18,243 --> 01:01:20,243
there is no sun.

473
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:25,649
My friend does not like using
too much boat at night.

474
01:01:27,728 --> 01:01:33,281
- He sees his wife and kids only at night.
- Give him some more.

475
01:01:33,521 --> 01:01:35,179
- For me?
- Yeah.

476
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:37,618
- You pay my friend too?
- Yeah.

477
01:01:37,758 --> 01:01:42,917
You be at pier at 8.30.
The name of the boat is Estrella.

478
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:47,196
A thousand thanks, señor.

479
01:01:48,886 --> 01:01:50,824
Good.

480
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:57,203
We'll go to town and wait
by the water till dark. Let's go.

481
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:37,085
- Hold it a minute, will you?
- Hang on.

482
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:07,875
Better go fishing when you've got the chance.

483
01:03:07,975 --> 01:03:11,075
That's what you
came down here for, wasn't it?

484
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,988
You guys are really fools.

485
01:03:16,228 --> 01:03:19,673
If you wanted, one of you
would have got away.

486
01:03:19,773 --> 01:03:24,888
But you kept thinking about each other.
So you missed some chances.

487
01:03:25,028 --> 01:03:28,551
You got tired. You slowed down.

488
01:03:29,745 --> 01:03:32,100
Now it's pretty late.

489
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,332
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be in Guaymas.

490
01:03:36,643 --> 01:03:40,449
Too bad you're not making
the whole trip with me.

491
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:44,091
That'd be kinda silly, wouldn't it?

492
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:51,395
You stink, Myers!

493
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:54,795
You smell. Just like your clothes.

494
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:57,410
Sure, you'll get to Guaymas,

495
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:02,048
but they'll catch up with you
and put you out of your misery.

496
01:04:02,148 --> 01:04:06,500
You haven't got a chance.
You haven't got a thing except that gun.

497
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,492
You'd better hang on to it,

498
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:10,893
because without it, you're nothing.

499
01:04:10,993 --> 01:04:14,393
- You're finished!
- Shut up!

500
01:04:17,368 --> 01:04:19,404
Gracias, Carlos.

501
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,794
Caramba!

502
01:04:32,887 --> 01:04:36,349
Pronto! Llame la policía!
Este hombre está en la cantina de mi primo!

503
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:40,350
Se va esta noche en la estrella!
El barco de mi amigo Jaime!

504
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:44,150
No Carlos, no estoy borracho!
Llame a la policía!

505
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:50,625
Bueno. La policía. No, no, no, la policía!

506
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,398
Hold it.

507
01:05:30,959 --> 01:05:35,522
All right, Collins. Now you get
to take a nice walk all by yourself.

508
01:05:35,622 --> 01:05:39,222
Down the alley and out on the dock.
Me and Bowen will follow.

509
01:05:39,322 --> 01:05:42,161
If you try to tip anyone off,
I'll let Bowen have it.

510
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:46,525
You wouldn't want that, would you?
Get going.

511
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:50,815
Go ahead, Collins.

512
01:06:50,915 --> 01:06:54,622
All the way out. Keep under the lights.

513
01:08:31,063 --> 01:08:34,279
Alto!

514
01:08:34,379 --> 01:08:36,596
Alto ahí!

515
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:40,097
I'm not Myers! I'm not Myers!

516
01:08:40,736 --> 01:08:43,712
D'you hear me? I'm not Myers!

517
01:08:51,415 --> 01:08:53,819
Alto! Alto!

518
01:08:59,747 --> 01:09:02,147
Alto! Alto ahí!

519
01:09:04,883 --> 01:09:06,704
Alto! Alto!

520
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:12,398
Put your hands up. Walk this way.

521
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:15,200
Do as he tells you, Myers.

522
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:17,500
You're all through.

523
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,314
That's enough!

524
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:11,415
Lléveselo!

525
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,157
I'm sorry. We have to have full report.

526
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:24,070
You understand. Gracias.

527
01:10:28,128 --> 01:10:30,149
It's all right.
