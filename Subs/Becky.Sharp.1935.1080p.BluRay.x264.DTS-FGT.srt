1
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,692
Amelia!

2
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,702
Did you think we were going to forget you?

3
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,962
And not say good bye,
and see you go without gifts?

4
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,793
Elizabeth!

5
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:47,432
Lines to Amelia upon leaving
miss pinkerton's academy.

6
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:55,474
Farewell, farewell, sweet
friend of childhood years.

7
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,818
Let sorrow not detain thee,
nor our tears.

8
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,618
Thy wings have grown,
they seek another nest.

9
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:11,832
I can't... I can't... oh, Amelia!

10
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,713
Our pretty, poor Amelia. Now she will
never hear the end of that tender poem.

11
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,467
Oh, well, there's too much bad poetry
in the world anyway.

12
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,887
But Becky, haven't you a single tear
for the years you've spent here?

13
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,848
No, my sweet, tears are not
expected of charity pupils.

14
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,562
Oh, no, no tears. Humility.

15
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,649
Gratitude for an education not so
very useful, but, oh, so genteel.

16
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,237
And curtsies for the leftover food
of the second table.

17
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,570
And the lovely frocks that the other girls
will no longer wear.

18
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,238
Oh, no, Laura. No tears.

19
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:53,282
We orphans must learn that the
luxury of emotion is for our betters.

20
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,791
Miss Pinkerton herself.

21
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:13,720
Miss Sedley. As you now leave us to return to the
polished and refined bosom of your family...

22
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,520
You depart rich in those
virtues and accomplishments

23
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:24,112
which characterize the
young English gentlewoman.

24
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,825
In music, dancing and orthography

25
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,203
you have realized our fondest hopes.

26
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,866
And in the principles
of religion and morality

27
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,163
you have proved yourself worthy
of this establishment.

28
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:51,382
Receive then, dear child, this elegantly bound
copy of the illustrious Dr. Johnson's dictionary

29
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,347
as a token of my affection.

30
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,439
A dictionary!
It shall always rest under my pillow.

31
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,901
Miss sharp!

32
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,947
The time has come... oui, oui, mademoiselle.
Je veux vous faire mes adieux.

33
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,787
Be good enough to respond
in the English tongue.

34
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,078
Oh, dear, miss Pinkerton, I'd quite forgotten
that you can't quite understand French.

35
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,380
For a moment I thought I was talking to my
dear dead mother, whose language it was.

36
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,179
But who could blame me or any of us
for thinking of you as a mother?

37
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:35,175
Miss sharp, what I meant to say was

38
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,685
you are about to go forth
into the world alone,

39
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,180
unaided, to exist by the
fruits of your labor.

40
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,271
I hope you go with the feeling of gratitude

41
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,985
for the gift you have
received within these walls.

42
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,356
Oh, ma'am, what other feeling is possible?
Not one of hatred, certainly.

43
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,404
Not one of wanting to leave this place.

44
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,694
Or a feeling that you took
me because I was useful.

45
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,158
Mercy, wasn't it a joy teaching
the younger girls music and French

46
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,250
and knowing how much money I saved for you?

47
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,370
Oh, it was, it was.

48
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,747
Goodbye, then.

49
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,216
Oh, this dictionary, for you.

50
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,345
Miss Pinkerton. Mr. Joseph Sedley, ma'am.

51
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,304
Enter, sir.

52
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,926
Joseph! Ahhh!

53
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,892
Dearest Jos.
Bless my soul, it must be you, is it?

54
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,605
Now, Jos, how many sisters have you?

55
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,193
Monstrous clever of you to put
it that way. Monstrous clever.

56
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,570
Welcome to Chiswick mall, sir.

57
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,322
Your servant, ma'am.
Your sister's belongings are ready.

58
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,441
Splendid! Meredith!

59
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,364
Fetch my sister's trunk.

60
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,826
And now let us kiss our little
friends, Amy, and then be on our way.

61
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:43,042
Adieu, dear friend.
Oh, my Becky, to think we must part now.

62
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,079
Yes, part. Where will you go?
What's going to happen to you?

63
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,298
Does it matter?
Thank heaven you're safely cared for.

64
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,258
Becky, permit me, my brother Joseph.

65
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,593
Your servant, ma'am.

66
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,594
Who's coming to take you away, darling?

67
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,136
The diligence?
Public conveyance?

68
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,518
It will have to do.
I have no gallant brother to claim me.

69
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,474
But my four horses claim you,

70
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,767
that are waiting outside.

71
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,899
Miss sharp's traveling arrangements
have already been made.

72
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,649
What is your destination?
I have no destination.

73
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,035
Amelia, is this true?
Not a pillow to her name?

74
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,779
No, it isn't true. No longer.

75
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,499
Becky, you're coming home with me until
you find suitable employment somewhere.

76
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,956
No, no, I mustn't burden you.

77
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,329
Oh, you angel.

78
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,918
Huzzah! I shout huzzah!

79
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,292
My man will seek your trunk presently.

80
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,168
I feel it my duty to warn you.

81
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,759
I can't abandon her. She has nobody.

82
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,926
Nobody.

83
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,967
Goodbye, miss Pinkerton. Goodbye!

84
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,811
Bye! Bye Amelia!

85
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,648
Goodbye, goodbye!

86
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,412
Miss Pinkerton! Words
are but little thanks.

87
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,618
Yet let this speak volumes.

88
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,498
Back to your rooms!

89
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,172
For you, Becky.

90
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,044
I shall press this one too.

91
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,051
I've kept all of your dear flowers.

92
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,136
Becky, I don't know what to say to you.

93
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,469
By Jove, dare I call you my...

94
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,262
Your what, Joseph?

95
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,897
My bird?

96
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,016
Or something similar?

97
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,606
I wonder if your George Osborne in there
is calling Amelia something similar?

98
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,087
How I admire men who do not hesitate
to express their emotions.

99
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,968
I offer you love, Amelia,
and a lifetime of devotion.

100
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,180
Now you've heard us both,
the choice is yours, madam.

101
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,346
Why do you make it so difficult for me?

102
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,720
Two little boys I grew up with.

103
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,722
How am I to choose between them?

104
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,855
Am I to say no to you, William,
whom I've always respected?

105
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,237
Or to you, George, whom I've always...

106
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,107
Always... loved, Amelia, loved?

107
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,942
Admired.

108
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:06,445
Let him be your choice, then. Take George.

109
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,869
Oh, my dear.
I shall love you nonetheless, always.

110
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,749
Only I shall think of you as a sister.

111
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,583
A sister who is married to my best...
My oldest friend.

112
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,090
William dobbin, no man had a truer friend.

113
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,965
By Jove, that scoundrel
kissed my sister's hand.

114
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,341
I'll make him marry her.

115
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,387
Too late, Joseph.
The question has just been popped.

116
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,225
What? Why, I didn't realize it.

117
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,770
Why, that's beautiful.

118
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,394
What a handsome best man you'll make.

119
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,609
Only I'll not be there to see you.

120
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,029
I'll be gone by then. Not if Joseph
Sedley has anything to do with it.

121
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,659
How can Joseph Sedley keep me here?

122
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:49,872
By offering you the continued hospitality
of his father's home.

123
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,619
You're too noble. But if you were to keep me
here any longer I should never want to leave.

124
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,417
I'd dream that I could stay forever.

125
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,420
See you about me, receive your roses.

126
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,632
An idle dream, isn't it Joseph?

127
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,387
I... 1...

128
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,715
A foolish unrealizable dream.

129
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,602
But I must face the world,
look for employment,

130
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,810
Becky, Becky, don't... I...

131
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,024
What is it, Joseph?

132
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,019
Do you care? Do I care? Why I...

133
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,008
When I think of you without a home, I...

134
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,115
I'm completely a man... a man.

135
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,110
I... 1...

136
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,620
Becky!

137
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,829
Becky, I've news to tell
you, such wonderful news.

138
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,045
George... has asked for your
hand and you accepted him.

139
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,459
Oh, my little blushing bride.

140
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,549
You are happy? You'll never know
how happy, you're not in love.

141
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,594
Perhaps I am.
Perhaps I too have given my heart.

142
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,974
And you never told me about it.

143
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,012
We wanted to surprise you.
Joseph is so shy, so timid.

144
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,307
Our Joseph?
Oh, Becky, you poor, poor girl.

145
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,851
Poor? Is Joseph so undesirable a match?

146
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,567
Oh, then it must be I.

147
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,858
Father would never approve.
I know him, he...

148
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,359
I understand.

149
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,286
I've reached above my station.
I've no fine pedigree.

150
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,123
Stop, Becky. Father has
ambitions for Joseph.

151
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,910
He plans to send him to
India on government service.

152
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:21,251
Wise father. Don't weep precious. I'll marry
one of these days some worthy tradesman.

153
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,921
A draper, a greengrocer, someone humble
fit to my position.

154
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,218
Present my compliments to your father
and say that I'm leaving tonight.

155
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,474
And good luck to Joseph, the civil servant.

156
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,810
The government needs men of courage,
decision, men who are brave.

157
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:26,525
Well, here we are. Don't be making up your mind
too soon if you'll be wanting to stay here.

158
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,731
Are those... are they my pupils?

159
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:33,073
Ay, brood of Satan, that's what they are.

160
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,956
Well, you see, for better or worse,
you're at Queen's Crawley.

161
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,329
The food's bad, the service hard,
and the pay miserly.

162
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,877
I arranged for the position
through correspondence.

163
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,298
Sir Pitt Crawley told you about
all this in his letter, did he?

164
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:54,465
Of course he didn't. He blessed the
devil himself a drive in the bargain.

165
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:03,066
For the last time, what
is all that noise for?

166
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,899
Stop or it'll be the death of you!

167
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,191
Silence, have you lost your minds?

168
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,983
Quiet, you hear me?

169
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,914
Children, your governess.

170
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,915
Come and meet them.

171
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,339
Now. Try and make ladies
and gentlemen of them.

172
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,927
This is their brother.

173
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,478
Nothing better that they for his cold ears.

174
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,097
I welcome you under our roof tree.

175
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,313
Peace and happiness, he says!

176
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,110
Stop it! Stop it!

177
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,905
I don't think I've had sufficient training for
the position your father so kindly offered me.

178
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,370
If you would so inform the baronet.

179
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,581
He inform the baronet?

180
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,327
Hasn't the baronet ears of his own to hear?

181
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:11,960
Bless you, missy. I am sir Pitt Crawley
and these are my children.

182
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,514
Quiet! Quiet!

183
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:26,353
Quiet!

184
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,154
That's another son.

185
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,536
As worthless a scoundrel as ever wore
the king's uniform.

186
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,953
Then you'll not be staying, eh?

187
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,044
Pucks take it...

188
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:52,963
Why, you're the prettiest governess
I've ever had my hands on.

189
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,806
Sir Pitt, as I was saying, although I haven't had
enough experience for so exacting a position,

190
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,639
I should like to accept.

191
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,433
These dear little children have completely
won my heart.

192
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,934
You'll live to regret it.
But I'm glad.

193
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,569
My name is Becky, darlings.

194
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,861
Would you like me to read
you a pretty story? No!

195
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,451
And here I bring you "the blind
washerwoman of moorefield".

196
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,835
A moral and instructive volume.

197
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,879
Mr. Pitt, it's kind of you, but I haven't yet finished
"thrump's legacy" that you brought me last week.

198
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,713
Read them both, then, read them both.

199
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,096
Works by pious authors
are soothing to the soul.

200
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,593
What was that about the soul, Pitt?

201
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,438
Let me hear it too.
You know how your sermons always affect me.

202
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,402
I hope to see you later, miss Rebecca.

203
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,527
Now I must work on my speech
for the questionable aid society.

204
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,402
Questionable aid society.

205
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,328
How on earth do you stand him, Becky?

206
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,740
What choice have I? I must watch
the side my bread is buttered on.

207
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,662
Why bread when that little mouth
was made for cake and kisses?

208
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,377
And of the two, you would willingly
supply the second. Oh, not enough.

209
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,633
Not half so nourishing as bread.

210
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,504
On the contrary. Every kiss counts, Becky.

211
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,594
I'm returning to London tomorrow.

212
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,429
Regimental duty.

213
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,761
London is such a large town.

214
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,061
So many willing lips to please a soldier.
Yes, but none like yours.

215
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,780
Becky, these pretty little hands,
who will hold them when I'm gone?

216
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,444
They'll be very busy.

217
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,452
Washing Violet, combing Rose,
mending sir Pitt's shirts.

218
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,537
Oh, blasted, you shouldn't
be doing all that.

219
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,915
Becky, if I were to ask
you to come to London...

220
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,785
To find a position for you.

221
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,796
I've tried all that
no, queen's Crawley is my haven.

222
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,414
Oh, but there must be something.

223
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,507
Some... Becky, wait!

224
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,001
I have an aunt in London.

225
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,387
Young and pretty, of course.
No, old and a spinster, but rich.

226
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,718
I can persuade her that
she shouldn't stay alone.

227
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,182
That she needs a companion.

228
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,929
And I need a protector, Rawdon.

229
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,442
Becky!

230
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,146
Becky sharp!

231
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,820
Can't you hear me? Where is that girl?

232
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,940
Sharp! Sharp! Sharp!

233
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:26,161
Miss Crawley, mam. Are you perhaps calling
miss sharp, mam?

234
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,245
No! I'm calling on heaven
to help me preserve me calm!

235
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,334
Where is me drops? Where is me jelly?

236
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,828
Am I to sit here and be
murdered with inattention?

237
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,874
Where in blazes is that misbegotten girl?

238
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,843
Miss Crawley, mam,
if I may venture the opinion, mam...

239
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:45,931
Miss sharp has left the house, mam.
Probably on some dark amorous errand.

240
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,425
Some dark amorous errand, eh?

241
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,802
I wouldn't put it past her.

242
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:55,604
I've been watching her for weeks. A smile
for the butcher, and a smile for the baker.

243
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,811
That girl hasn't a principle
to bless herself with.

244
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,656
That's what I like about her.
What are those weeds doing here?

245
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,071
You know how vegetation nauseates me.

246
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,985
But these were brought by your nephew, mam.

247
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,362
Captain Crawley.

248
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,784
Very cozy nosegays.
Throw it out! And throw my nephew out too.

249
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,161
What the devil is he doing around here
every single day?

250
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,797
Well, that's not hard to guess, mam.

251
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,963
Miss sharp has a way of blinking,
and a way of winking.

252
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:27,223
What? Are you suggesting that my nephew
would as much as notice that girl?

253
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,308
How dare you? Show him in.

254
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,973
And get miss sharp for me.

255
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,764
Go to her room! Get her!
Don't you come back here without her!

256
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,890
Yes, mam.

257
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,857
Oh, my head, my head.

258
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,352
I know I shall get the vapors.

259
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,027
Miss Crawley is awaiting you, sir.

260
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,362
Dear aunt Julia.

261
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,864
Well, sir, to what am I indebted for
the questionable honor of this visit?

262
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,698
To the affection of a devoted nephew.

263
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:58,329
And do devoted nephews always get themselves oiled
and barbered to call on their maiden aunts?

264
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,462
Or did you hope to find
Becky sharp at home?

265
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,842
Answer Mel!

266
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,006
Becky, eh?

267
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:10,633
Now I will not have you so much
as look at Becky. Remember that!

268
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,098
That girl will twist you
round her little finger.

269
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:17,230
But aunt Julia, I assure you...
Don't assure me, sir, I assure you!

270
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:22,737
I will indulge and I've been generous. I've paid your
card debts and I've laughed at your extravagance!

271
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:27,733
But I'll not have you ensnared
by any calculated little snip of a menial.

272
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:32,288
The woman you marry must be a lady.
And a lady of quality!

273
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,909
How dare you come bounding
into the room like this.

274
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,084
Just as I knowed. Miss sharp's not
in her room. She's not in the house.

275
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,172
There isn't a stitch of clothing in the
closet and there's a trunk all packed.

276
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,089
Trunk? Packed? Well, where is it?
Bring it here! Instantly!

277
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,509
Well, well, well...!
Do you expect me to go for it myself?

278
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,177
Hurry! Hurry!

279
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,727
Who is it now?
Am I never to have any peace?

280
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,731
Rawdon, put that Brandy down!

281
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,323
Ardent spirits are for invalids only.
Give it to me.

282
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,362
Mr. Pitt calling, ma'am.

283
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:14,781
That pewling hypocrite!
Don't you dare show him in!

284
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:20,294
Well, sir. Isn't London difficult enough
without your presence?

285
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,040
Here you come, reeking with the vulgar
urges of the country.

286
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:28,465
Madam, I've been sent by my good father.
That old reprobate, what does he want?

287
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,756
My father wishes to know if you still
have need of miss Rebecca's services.

288
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,805
I certainly haven't, but neither has he.

289
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,679
Sir Pitt is lonesome, madam, very lonesome.

290
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,104
If he's lonesome, let him join Napoleon at
Elba. Then they can both be lonesome together.

291
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,360
Ah, good!

292
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,400
The trunk, mam. Bring it here.

293
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,278
Open it!

294
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,540
Now we shall see what we shall see.

295
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:03,537
Angels of bath!
What the deuce is this?

296
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:07,257
Not what a respectable
female I should gaze on.

297
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,293
Tights!

298
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,844
And look at this!

299
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:16,763
Pantomime. And an 'orrid licentious wig!
Confound you, leave her things alone.

300
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,393
She's acting on my orders, Rawdon.

301
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,982
Here's a Rouge pot.
Ah, cosmetics, sinful, sinful.

302
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:27,273
Give me that.
And here is Becky sharp herself.

303
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,281
Wait! It's Becky's own handwriting.

304
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:36,199
"A portrait of my mother".
Becky sharp's mother a dancer?

305
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,206
At the risk of contradicting you, mam,
miss sharp's mother was an aristocrat.

306
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,870
A French lady by the name of Montmorency.

307
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,999
You're wrong, Rawdon.

308
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,170
I have it on miss Rebecca's own authority
that her mother's name was denier.

309
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:50,130
Here it says
"a portrait of my mother by my father".

310
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,674
A painter fellow?

311
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:58,426
And I had it on Becky's own authority that
her father was distinguished and rich.

312
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,052
I don't care what that blasted thing says.

313
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,224
I don't believe a word of
it, not a single word of it.

314
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,895
Believe it, captain Crawley.
Believe anything, everything!

315
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,228
Only these relics, they're
mine, sacred to me.

316
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,647
And no hand shall ever
touch them but my own.

317
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,196
How well I remember that sweet smile.

318
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,945
Her portrait painted in exile.

319
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,915
This is how she looked always when she'd
bend over my bed, singing me to sleep.

320
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,919
Yes, my mother was a dancer. She danced
herself and she taught others to dance.

321
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,629
But she was an aristocrat.
Oh, make no mistake about that.

322
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,375
A Montmorency of the
finest blood of France.

323
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,919
And that was the thing for which
she was exiled by the revolution.

324
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,922
Her chateau burned, her estate confiscated,
her fortune taken from her.

325
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:41,552
Yes, she danced. Danced to feed her baby,
her only child.

326
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,847
To clothe me, to shelter me!

327
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:51,229
Do you wonder now why I treasure these
things that remind me of my mother?

328
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,912
Oh, this string of beads!

329
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:13,338
Miss Rebecca! Don't.
Not all diminishes when the heart is pure.

330
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:19,674
How dare you! Apologize
to miss sharp at once!

331
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,268
Miss sharp, we apologize...

332
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,441
Poor girl!
We were so unjust to her.

333
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:38,112
A little Brandy, please.

334
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,829
Send for Dr. crackenbush.
I know I'm going to die.

335
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,286
We must all part when the hour cometh.

336
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,348
Come in.

337
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,511
Becky, darling, why didn't you tell me?

338
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,351
Do you suppose I would have cared who
your mother was, how you were brought up?

339
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,019
Why did you have to hide things from me?

340
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,439
If you had led my life you would want
to hide some things even from yourself.

341
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,859
Oh, tell me, are you sorry about yesterday?

342
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,905
I sorry? My Becky darling, you're
my wife now, my own sweet wife.

343
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:25,243
Your wife! We've been married less then
24 hours and already you doubt my words.

344
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,811
I don't, darling. I only want to know...

345
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,827
Know? Want more? Still more? Endlessly?

346
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,460
Do you want to hear about my father?

347
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:35,423
How he drank? How drink killed his talent,
his hopes, his wife?

348
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:40,387
When he beat her. And when I begged him
"daddy, daddy, don't strike her, strike me!".

349
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,971
What do you think he did?

350
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,305
I'll tell you: He struck me.
Oh, my sweet Becky. My poor darling.

351
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,512
Oh, don't pity me, perhaps I'm lying.

352
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,308
Perhaps I'm inventing the story as I go
along. I don't care, I still love you.

353
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,521
Oh, that's what I wanted to hear.

354
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,655
Love me, Rawdon. Love me.
I've had so little love in my life.

355
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,946
I've been kicked about so much.
Take me away from here.

356
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,532
Oh, but Becky, we couldn't do that.
My aunt would disinherit me.

357
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,493
Who cares if she does?
We mean more to each other than money.

358
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,412
Oh, darling, get a hackney coach.

359
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,077
Come for me when it's dark.

360
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:21,803
Oh, why did I want you, my silly? What have
you? Not a penny, not a plan, not ambition.

361
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,969
But we'll make out, my
Rawdon, we'll make out.

362
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,513
Life owes me many things
and I intend to get them.

363
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,431
All it takes is the least touch of wit.

364
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,101
Oh, don't look so disturbed.

365
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,349
I don't expect you to supply the wit.

366
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,898
That's my dowry to you.

367
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:47,576
Lieutenant Osborne, you silly! I'll not
have you saying such things in my house.

368
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,036
Marriage is far too sacred to jest about.

369
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,456
Amelia, did you hear what your
husband said? No, darling.

370
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:57,172
He said Rawdon was prolonging our honeymoon
just to scare other men away from me.

371
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,583
George is such a wit.

372
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,835
Yes, both of you are, dear.

373
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,263
Do you think I've done justice to
your treasure, lieutenant Osborne?

374
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,131
Beautiful, so delicate.

375
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,225
Is that all the praise I deserve?

376
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,562
Oh, Amelia, your husband's embarrassing me.

377
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,144
He simply doesn't respond to art.

378
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,184
Don't be too critical, love.

379
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,569
Your beauty is too gentle to reproduce.

380
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:23,156
Becky, how talented you are.
It's lovely...

381
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,006
George, what the deuce is keeping you?
We want you back in the game.

382
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:30,030
Oh, George, please don't play anymore.
You've lost so much lately.

383
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,703
Oh, let him play. Gambling is an
agreeable vice for a young man.

384
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,955
We can't afford it. We're already in debt.
In debt?

385
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,004
Lo, my precious, look about you.
This is the house that debt built.

386
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:43,252
Why, I'm wearing a debt dress, standing on a debt
rug. We must owe money to every shopkeeper in London.

387
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,965
We mustn't, but we do. Come on, George.

388
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,715
Let me touch your hand.
It will bring you luck.

389
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,883
Gentlemen, I said Ace and I keep my word.

390
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,303
Only three short.
Why not, it's quite earned.

391
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,769
Where's your lady, Rawdon? She promised
to stand behind my chair and bring me luck.

392
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,103
She promised me that.

393
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,986
That's the way she
entices Rawdon's victims.

394
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,988
To the victims she pays no favors,
does she, gentlemen?

395
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,690
George, would you like to throw next?

396
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,948
How many years since I heard you play last?

397
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,915
It was on your own harpsichord.

398
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,917
How I envied you for it.

399
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,703
But then I envied you for so much.

400
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,627
For all that you had and I didn't.

401
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:25,126
Becky, you envied?
You didn't pay any attention to me at all.

402
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:28,881
You were too busy with Joseph.
That fat brother of yours?

403
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,349
Oh, how you all worried
for fear I'd marry him.

404
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,640
That's why poor Joseph was
shipped off to India, wasn't it?

405
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,855
Becky, you know father...
Never mind that.

406
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,020
That's all forgotten.

407
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,354
That's the past.

408
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,988
Oh, Becky. You're the most generous,
the most forgiving darling.

409
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,208
Becky. Amelia.
Captain Thorndyke has just told us.

410
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,127
Napoleon has escaped from Elba.

411
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,250
Napoleon? Napoleon?

412
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,510
War? War, yes.

413
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,345
Our regiment will be ordered to Belgium.

414
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,766
How terrible! How amusing!

415
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,473
Becky! What are you saying?

416
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:19,106
What luck! What incredibly dazzling luck!

417
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,732
Are you out of your mind?
Yes, I'm crazy for joy!

418
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,601
War! Belgium! A new start!

419
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,863
What have we here? Debts.
Tradesmen getting nasty! Bills!

420
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,260
And why do you think our luck will improve
in Brussels?

421
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,284
Because...

422
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,159
We'll force it to.
Silver, aren't they pretty?

423
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,072
I found them in a little curiosity shop
and I couldn't resist them.

424
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,789
Seven.

425
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,829
Seven again.

426
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,000
Becky!
And don't imagine I'll ever use them.

427
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,290
How silly you are. You look so frightened.

428
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:48,088
They happened to amuse me.
I had no idea they were loaded.

429
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,798
Not for us, are they, dear?

430
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,637
That's not the way to coax lady luck.

431
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,882
Not your way. By gad, no.

432
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,891
No, sweet, no.

433
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:59,353
Remember what's ahead of us.
Brussels! Brussels!

434
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:03,771
Everyone will be there. Officers with their
wives. The best people, the richest people.

435
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,482
Society! A new life, Rawdon.

436
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,615
Oh, we should be very grateful to Napoleon.
Darling.

437
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,773
Now I understand why Wellington keeps us
in Brussels.

438
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,485
England expects every man to do his duty...
Nightly.

439
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,239
Now, general, don't make me sorry 1
invited you. I shall send you home.

440
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:41,410
To be thrown out by the duchess of Richmond
is the beginning of a social career.

441
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,580
Impossible man!
Don't listen to him. I adore it here.

442
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,921
So breathtaking, so brilliant.
Always the danger of a sudden attack.

443
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,925
No danger, my dear. There will be no
fighting till the Prussians join us.

444
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,511
Mrs. Crawley, a waltz, a single waltz.

445
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,134
No, don't ask me, not a waltz.

446
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,429
Can't I pressure you, Mrs. Crawley?
That's just what I was afraid of.

447
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:08,725
Such an immodest dance, don't you
think, prince, all cling and swing.

448
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:12,024
It's the dance of the angel.
A fallen angel.

449
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,528
Mama, she slapped papa.
That was papa Mrs. Crawley slapped.

450
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,868
Pay no attention, Blanche.
You're too fine to notice such vulgarity.

451
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,624
Oh, that slap. What memories it evokes.

452
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:29,621
Would you believe, ma'am, Mrs. Crawley
honored my ears once by slapping them?

453
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,840
Why, the inelegant creature.
Whatever induced the duchess of Richmond

454
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,880
to invite a mere ex-governess?

455
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:41,466
Don't leave me gentlemen, I'm weakening. I
find it impossible to choose from among you.

456
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,059
Then choose me, Becky.

457
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,346
Becky? Don't you know me?

458
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,643
Have I changed so much in these few years?

459
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,479
Oh, no, it isn't true. It can't be.

460
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,896
Not Joseph Sedley.

461
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,644
The name sounds familiar to me, mam.

462
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,484
By Jove, Becky, it's good to see you.

463
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,345
You haven't changed a bit. I could have
picked you out from amongst the regiment.

464
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,951
I'm still the same little girl
who wasn't good enough for you to marry.

465
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,435
Don't say that, Becky. You know I'd have married you
in a moment if it hadn't been for those elephants.

466
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,451
You know, it was father who shipped me off
to India to hunt the blasted pachyderm.

467
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,874
I know, your dear little sister Amelia
told me all about it.

468
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,089
But, then, what were
you doing in India, Jos?

469
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,880
Your son?
Becky! You blacken my character.

470
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:20,676
No, I collected taxes and
butterflies for the prince.

471
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,511
I gave him a lot of butterflies.

472
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,893
I'd rather hear about the taxes.
Come, let's make Rawdon listen.

473
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,140
Rawdon? Where is he?

474
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,306
Three eights, good for six
and one for his knob, seven.

475
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,104
Sorry, old chap, my game again.
As usual.

476
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,692
It's nothing but luck, eh, Rawdon?

477
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,938
Nothing but luck, George.
Very good, then I owe you 30 pounds.

478
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,691
Rawdon, George!
I brought you a dear, old friend.

479
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,445
Hello, Rawdon.
I've already seen Joseph, all of him.

480
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,060
Well, you've been neglecting me all
evening. Take me for a dance, George.

481
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,949
Joseph will play your silly cribbage.

482
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,622
Oh, Rawdon, perhaps you'll let him beat you
at billiards.

483
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,712
Billiards? I haven't touched
a cue for three years.

484
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,831
Although we have a similar game in India.

485
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,297
Except we play it with one
ball and a mallet on horseback.

486
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,464
I'm dying for a dance.
No, I want to talk to you.

487
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,517
Here.

488
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,508
Now you shall give me my answer.

489
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,473
I'm not very good at giving answers.
I seldom listen to the questions.

490
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,980
You'll listen to this one.
Why didn't you reply to my letter?

491
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,770
Because only very silly people
put such things in writing.

492
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,276
Rawdon can read, you know.

493
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,735
What if he had seen your letter?

494
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,114
Or somebody had whispered about it
into Amelia's pearly little ears.

495
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,279
It's too late for me to be concerned
about Amelia.

496
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,910
You and I are going away.
Are we?

497
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,326
I love Rawdon, always remember that.

498
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,288
I remember it daily. I remember when
I lose to him 10 pounds, 50 pounds.

499
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,170
I tell myself it'll buy so much lace,
so much silk for Becky.

500
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:38,416
Champagne, servants. You've been
expensive, Becky, but I lost willingly.

501
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,677
Now, I've no more. I'm in debt.

502
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,800
Have you ever tried to borrow?

503
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,593
Not a bad method.

504
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,431
There's no one left to borrow from.
But that doesn't matter, does it?

505
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,269
You don't care anything about money.

506
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,435
You make such charming conversation.

507
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,899
Why do you deprive Amelia?

508
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,685
Becky, listen to me.

509
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,820
No, I don't want to go in there.

510
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,440
I can't bear to see them together.

511
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,609
Becky on George's arm.

512
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,997
George is either dancing with her
or losing at cards to her husband.

513
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,957
Oh, William, I can't do
anything, I'm helpless.

514
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,790
I'll take Becky for a dance.
And after the dance?

515
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,628
She'd find him again, trust her.

516
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,461
If I could only make George understand.

517
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,084
And there's another thing I didn't like
about your letter.

518
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,925
You misspelled every other word.

519
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,090
Oh, hang my spelling. Don't play with me.

520
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,142
Is there someone else? No.

521
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,727
Who is that man?

522
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,184
Oh, I intended just a
homey, intimate affair.

523
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,606
A little singing, dancing.
Oh, my dear, dear lord Steyne.

524
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,270
Dear lord Steyne, I've
been looking for you.

525
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,782
I thought you were hopelessly lost. Your
grace must blame the Polish ambassador.

526
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,194
Diplomatic secrets? Not at all, the
ambassador too has chosen to bring his wife.

527
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,323
She has won me over completely
to the Polish cause.

528
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,616
At least to the better
half of the Polish cause.

529
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,998
Tell me, what is his name?

530
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,746
I want to know.

531
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,541
How perfect your instincts are, Becky.

532
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,885
The marquess of Steyne,
Steyne with his millions.

533
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,675
Bigger game, eh?

534
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:12,142
Will you tell me about Napoleon?
I'm so interested in him.

535
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,224
Is there any danger here in Brussels?

536
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,310
No, madam, as far as I know,
Napoleon is many leagues away.

537
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,444
Is it true that the king of Prussia is bent
on leading his own army?

538
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,696
Freddy? Freddy lead an army?

539
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,571
I wish I could whisper to you what
the czar Alexander told me about that.

540
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,407
Milord, you hobnob with all
the crowned heads of Europe.

541
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:34,290
No, only with those that still remain
on their royal shoulders.

542
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,451
You see, dear lady Bareacres,

543
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:40,455
royal heads have been known to hop away
from their bodies, especially in France.

544
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,250
Remarkable how many people managed
to come tonight.

545
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,385
Lady Blanche, I was so sorry to hear
of your mother's misfortune.

546
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,515
I do hope the operation was successful.

547
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:57,313
To think of her going blind at her age and
now she can't recognize even acquaintances.

548
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,599
These are glass eyes you're wearing,
aren't they?

549
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,475
Perfect, perfect.

550
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,603
I do hope they'll continue to attract men.

551
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:09,318
Who is that remarkable woman?
The brightest new star in our social sky.

552
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,986
Introduce me. I can spend many
nights studying astronomy.

553
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,909
Mrs. Crawley, permit me.

554
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,623
The marquess of Steyne asks the honor
of your acquaintance.

555
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,290
Milord. Will you favor me
with a dance, Mrs. Crawley?

556
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,414
What a joy it is to waltz.

557
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,167
So fond of it?
Oh, I could die for the waltz.

558
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:30,422
There are some who call it an immodest dance, but
I've always called it the dance of the angels.

559
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:35,097
George, Amelia's alone on the terrace.
Go to her. Ask her for a dance.

560
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,640
It's a drink I need, not a dance.

561
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,391
For me, war is rising stocks.

562
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,060
I play for Napoleon's defeat.
What do you play?

563
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,062
1? Patience.

564
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,031
Then we are both above
the fortunes of nations.

565
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,741
But not above wars.

566
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,737
Or champagne, froth, bubbles.

567
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,080
Your head swims, your heart beats.

568
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,116
Then your glass is empty.

569
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,668
And you wait for the headache.

570
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,920
Headaches can be cured.

571
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,002
Heartaches too, milord?

572
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,547
By drinking more wine. A new bottle.

573
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,758
And a new hand to pour it.

574
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:15,265
Oh, milord, I get drunk so easily.

575
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,356
Are we both waiting for a
light in that sky, madam?

576
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,610
Yes, I want this night to end.
I don't want the dark.

577
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,693
Heaven knows if it will end too soon.

578
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,574
If light comes before it's due.

579
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,087
Your grace.

580
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,208
Who was that man?

581
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,172
The Duke of Wellington.

582
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,333
What's there in the distance?

583
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,795
There? A village. A small village.

584
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,173
Waterloo, or some such name.

585
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,143
And then we went on from the...

586
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,850
And it was at that point...

587
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,169
What was that?

588
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,920
Did you hear it?
Shhh. Listen again.

589
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,549
Cannon? Thunder?

590
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,593
Artillery?
No, it must be a thunderstorm.

591
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,181
I say, was that a Cannon?

592
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,608
Your grace, can they shoot this far?
Sometimes they almost wish they could.

593
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,695
It's nothing. It must have been the wind.
It's just a thunderstorm.

594
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,582
I was so frightened.

595
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,618
It's a false alarm. Let's dance.

596
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,875
Music! Play music!

597
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,256
It's Napoleon!

598
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,925
Get my carriage!

599
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,246
Wait for me here.
I'll take you home in my carriage.

600
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,644
Becky!

601
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,645
Come with me. I'll take you home.
We could still leave.

602
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,090
The call to the colors. Did you hear,
lieutenant? The call to the colors.

603
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,979
It means nothing to me.
You are coming with me.

604
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,153
I'll desert, Becky, we'll go somewhere.
To Canada, to Sidney.

605
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,444
Only let's hurry. There's still time.
Why not take your wife, George?

606
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,113
Occasionally you must
remember that you're married.

607
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:51,785
George! Oh, my dear, I've
been so concerned about you.

608
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,877
You, Becky, concerned
about anyone but yourself?

609
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,542
You can't take George from me.
By heavens!

610
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,376
You'll never take him from me.
You're excited, Amelia, you're frightened.

611
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,378
I don't want your George.
See her home, George.

612
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,672
Take care of my poor Amy.

613
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,386
Au revoir, George.
I'll be watching you from above.

614
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,063
Rawdon! Darling!

615
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,401
Oh, Rawdon!

616
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,605
Darling, where have you been?
Wellington's orders.

617
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,445
I just dashed back for a few moments.

618
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,406
Oh, darling, I have so many
things to tell you before I go.

619
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,487
I've been happy with you.

620
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,740
I've gambled and I drank but always...

621
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:35,120
Always I've loved you. We've loved
each other, understood each other.

622
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,755
Here, take this money. I shan't need it.

623
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,589
You sell my watch, my silver dressing case.

624
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,335
Oh, darling, I leave you
with so many debts. No!

625
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,338
Sell my two horses.
Don't think about money. I'll make out.

626
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,682
I'll pray for you Rawdon. I want you back.

627
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,058
I love you!

628
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,479
I love you and I'll
never love anybody else.

629
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,601
I must go now, but remember...

630
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,440
Never forget this.

631
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,860
I worship you, Becky,
from your little toes up.

632
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,750
What shall I do? What will happen to me?

633
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,373
What will I do? How
shall I get out of here?

634
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,176
Answer me, you little devil!
Answer Mel

635
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,012
no horse, sahib.
All join the army.

636
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,220
Now what? Now what?
Am I to rot away in Brussels?

637
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,515
Why did I ever leave India? Why?
Why?

638
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,185
Becky!

639
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,358
Not a single horse left in Brussels.

640
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,727
Is this the end of Joseph Sedley?

641
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,771
I could sell you a horse. Becky!

642
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,442
I can sell you two horses.
A thousand apiece.

643
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,654
What? You're robbing!

644
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:52,029
Two thousand for the pair.
No, five hundred.

645
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,248
Do you prefer to walk?
You get winded so easily.

646
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,458
Seven-fifty for one horse.
Your proportions call for two horses.

647
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,126
Two thousand for the pair.

648
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,749
Two thousand pounds. I'm ruined.

649
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,218
Ruined. I could have bought
a herd of elephants for that.

650
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,510
Becky, where are those horses?

651
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:14,055
In the main stable. They'll recognize you.

652
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:47,502
The drums. The marching men. In an hour
they'll be dying for their country.

653
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,970
Dying for their country.

654
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,721
Well, I'm dying for my breakfast.

655
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,164
Lady southdown, would you do me the honor.

656
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,575
Lord Liverpool, please condescend.

657
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,461
And Mrs. Sedley, would you please.

658
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:09,584
Your grace... Mr. Sheridan.
My dear brother.

659
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,595
Lord Holland and I wish to sue for the
privilege of sitting on your right?

660
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,598
The loser is to challenge the
winner to pistols at forty paces.

661
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:22,021
Lord Holland's sat next to lady southdown
and you are by the famous Mrs. Siddons.

662
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,024
What would Mayfair say if the Danish Beau Brummel
sat next to me? They'd clap their hands.

663
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,232
You can't clap your hands
when you're whispering behind your palms.

664
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,446
Lord Steyne.

665
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,198
Huzzah! I shout a heartfelt huzzah!

666
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,614
With all these famous men here,
I feel I'm still in the house of lords.

667
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,582
Or lying in Westminster Abbey.

668
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:51,671
Why did you bring me here, Pitt?
This is a wicked and immoral atmosphere.

669
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,841
Look at lord Steyne and that woman.

670
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,464
That woman is your sister-in-law now, Jane,
please remember.

671
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,717
And remember also that she's very pious.

672
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,141
Why, before I married you
she and I used to read sermons together.

673
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,853
Everything is so delightful
in your new home, my dear.

674
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,647
These pictures, are they family portraits?

675
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,864
Ancestors, lady southdown.
Oh, yours or captain Crawley's?

676
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,859
Mine. The Duke and duchess de Cordonnet.

677
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:21,451
Lavinia and Alastair. I bought them
last week. Five pounds a piece.

678
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,621
Bravo!
You've got them eating out of your hand.

679
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,540
But they may bite it later.

680
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,344
Becky, you've arrived.
Where, milord, not St. James's palace?

681
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,389
Not yet.

682
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,180
Patience, Becky, Patience.

683
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:49,441
The queen presenteth miss Elizabeth Cooper.

684
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,996
Now watch out for Mrs. Crawley.

685
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,994
She has wagered me a hundred pounds if the prince
regent will stop the presentation to talk to her.

686
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,789
It's unthinkable. The court of St. James
will be shaken to its solemn foundation.

687
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,337
The foundations may be
solemn, but the head isn't.

688
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:18,587
The queen presenteth Mrs. Rawdon Crawley.

689
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,759
Did you get it?

690
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,052
Yes, I have, your grace.

691
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,222
And the man actually guarantees to take
ten pounds off every week.

692
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,988
The queen presenteth lady Cybil Clay.

693
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,739
Voila, madame.

694
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:42,988
Oh, exquis! Ravissant!

695
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,704
Oui, c'est séduisant, madame!
Very elegant, Becky!

696
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,334
Tell him I'll keep it.

697
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,919
Il ne peut pas le laisser sans avoir reçu
quelque chose.

698
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:55,962
Is the man mad? Can you imagine a tradesman
demanding cash in this house?

699
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,506
An outrage! Shall I kick
him down the stairs?

700
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,505
Be your usual gallant self
and just pay the bill.

701
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,507
Voila, monsieur.

702
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,225
Twenty-five pounds?
Oui, monsieur.

703
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,766
I don't pay that much
for my Sunday breeches.

704
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,514
Merci, monsieur.
Look here, Becky.

705
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,141
Every time I come here it costs me money.

706
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,713
You either borrow or I have to
gamble and lose, like a gentleman.

707
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,984
Why do you come?
To advance myself.

708
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,903
Did you or did you not promise me

709
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,113
that lord Steyne would have
me appointed to some post?

710
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,663
Well, I've spoken to him and he thinks
you'd make a very fine consul...

711
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,873
At some distant spot. When?

712
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:33,083
When? I thunder, when?
Promises are not enough. Am I a consul?

713
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,840
Do I wear a sword and a cocked hat?
Do I stand for the British land?

714
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,925
No! Thrice no!

715
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:44,014
Yes! Thrice yes! It's all settled.
You are to be made consul for Sierra Leone.

716
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,970
Sierra Leone?

717
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,139
Sierra Leone.

718
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,146
But, Becky. Those chaps are all cannibals.

719
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:54,812
How will they take to me?
Oh, I think they'll get to like you...

720
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,439
Bit by bit.

721
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,404
Huh? But... look here, Becky.

722
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,781
At last! Hello, Rawdon.

723
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,572
Where on earth have you been?
I've worried about you all night long.

724
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,699
I'm sorry. You shouldn't have.
I stayed at the club.

725
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,698
Club, eh?
You must have met some sirens, that's what.

726
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,709
Sirens.

727
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,286
Come now, Rawdon, confess.

728
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,379
You'll come again tomorrow, won't you?

729
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,527
Well, I'm here now, you know.

730
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,588
Wouldn't this be a good time for you
to be buying that cocked hat and sword?

731
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,052
That's right.
I'll Sally forth and have me outfitted.

732
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,963
Bit by bit. Your servant, Becky.

733
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,631
Your servant, Rawdon.

734
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,054
My echo... sounds.

735
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,726
Carey & Carter thirty-seven
pounds for livery.

736
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,022
And here's a little bill due for
eight hundred or they'll sue.

737
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,522
Bagatelle.

738
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:43,782
What's wrong, Rawdon?

739
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,945
Everything. I had a nasty night at the
club. Almost came to blows with Deuceace.

740
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,785
Others had to separate us and
all that sort of rot. But why?

741
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:54,159
He kept hounding me and threatening me about
the four hundred pounds that I owe him.

742
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:58,213
He demanded immediate payment. A pretty
time he picked. We haven't sixpence.

743
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,790
I know, that's the devil of it.

744
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,383
After the row it became a matter
for the entire club.

745
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,887
Naturally a debt of honor.
I was instructed to pay immediately.

746
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,308
You go away for a few days
and the whole thing will blow over.

747
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,928
No, it won't. This is not like
owing money to a shopkeeper.

748
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,772
This is a gambling debt.
I pay or I'm expelled.

749
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,061
Captain dobbin is in
charge of collecting it.

750
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,560
Who?
William dobbin. He represents the club.

751
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,154
Deuceace, that little swine. He was here last
week and he never even mentioned the debt.

752
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,195
He and I gambled while you played
billiards. Gambled? What did you play?

753
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,071
Dice. And I won.
For heaven's sake, you didn't...

754
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:34,870
The loaded dice? Oh come, come. I promised
you I never would. A promise is a promise.

755
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,332
I don't even know where they are.
I seem to have lost them.

756
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,296
Why do you look at me like that?

757
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,588
What do you see?
That I've become a liar, a cheat?

758
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,960
Oh, no, no.

759
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,383
But how can I help worrying, Becky?

760
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,469
Where is all this leading us?
Is there any end? Are we getting anywhere?

761
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,601
Who knows, who cares?
We live elegantly on nothing to year.

762
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,229
Look at all the splendor.
It won't last.

763
00:53:56,274 --> 00:54:00,187
We are paying heavily little bits of
ourselves. Well, it's worth the price.

764
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,526
Women who cut me last year would give their
eyes to be where I am now because they envy me.

765
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,945
This is what I've worked for.
I won't give it up! Don't ask me to.

766
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,866
Oh, darling, enjoy it with me.

767
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,495
But I can't get Deuceace out of my mind.

768
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,001
I'll raise the money somehow.
I could borrow it from...

769
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,041
Steyne? You won't, not from him.

770
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,174
We have to take the money from where
we can find it. Not Steyne's money.

771
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,385
I won't have all London thinking that...
You don't really trust me, do you?

772
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,842
Is that what you wish to say?
Oh, no, darling.

773
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,179
I'll believe only what you tell me
and nothing that you deny.

774
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:39,849
Then believe that I'm your Becky and that I love
you, I love you and nothing else matters...

775
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:48,069
Don't worry, darling.
Dobbin can be persuaded to wait.

776
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:52,490
Mrs. Crawley, I'm a brother officer of your
husband's and I'm sincerely trying to help him.

777
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:56,240
All I can say is that the debt will have
to be paid promptly, it's a debt of honor.

778
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,866
But I've told you, we have no money.

779
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,789
Where do you propose I turn
for four hundred pounds?

780
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,625
I have no suggestions to make.

781
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,873
And I'm afraid you have to
raise five hundred, not four.

782
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:09,716
Really? A hundred pounds added for interest
or damages to Deuceace's wounded feelings?

783
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:16,723
I'll try to explain as kindly as I can.
Mr. Deuceace came to me privately.

784
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,262
He's too much the gentleman
to charge this before the club.

785
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:23,771
It seems that you played dice with him some
time last week and he lost a hundred pounds.

786
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,778
He did? Well, it's too hard to remember.

787
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,523
At your house. You used
a pair of silver dice.

788
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,066
Loaded dice.

789
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,611
He managed to take them with him
after the game.

790
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,998
Unfortunately I've never seen them before.

791
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,036
Do you intend to use them?
I hope not.

792
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,038
Come now, aren't you rather enjoying this?

793
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,374
Here I am. You've always considered me
Amelia's bad angel.

794
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,960
You've always hated me.
Now I'm in your power.

795
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,595
You're not in my power, I'm still trying
to help Rawdon.

796
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,972
Oh, of course, then this
isn't a personal matter.

797
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,978
Then, if I appeal to your chivalry,
would you lend me the money?

798
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,972
No?

799
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,607
But perhaps you'd Grant me a delay?

800
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,735
I don't think I could persuade Mr.
Deuceace. I didn't think you would.

801
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,272
So, I came all prepared
to do business with you.

802
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,491
I have something to sell, something I think
you'll be interested in buying.

803
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:17,495
Madam, I couldn't possibly be... wait
until you see it, I've brought it with me.

804
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,037
By the way, I was brokenhearted to hear
that Amelia had rejected you again.

805
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,872
Mrs. Crawley!
Poor, darling Amelia...

806
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,746
She's still possessed with the idea
that she must be true to George.

807
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,633
Loyal to the dear ghost who was
so true to her when he was alive.

808
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,842
I have no desire to discuss...

809
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,796
Not to discuss how to gain the key
to her rusted little heart, captain?

810
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:36,305
What noble self-denial.

811
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:41,053
George wrote me a letter.
Not a literary gem, but clear.

812
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,019
The idea was that he and I elope.

813
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,838
You remember the duchess of Richmond's
ball? We were to go away that night.

814
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:51,150
It would be invaluable in your courtship.

815
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,614
Can you imagine the change
it would bring in Amelia?

816
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,700
It's for sale. Five hundred pounds.

817
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,861
Mrs. Crawley, women like you...

818
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,079
How much time have I to pay?
Till tomorrow morning.

819
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,580
Oh, generous, generous.
You'll get the money!

820
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:17,723
I was just thinking. If I were Amelia would
I respond any more readily to your charms.

821
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:33,981
I walked up and down in front of the hotel.
And I didn't dare come in.

822
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:37,025
But how could I resist when I knew
you were in town?

823
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:41,200
Rebecca, you haven't told me anything.
What is it? What has happened? Tell me.

824
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,415
No, I can't, your kindness
only makes it worse.

825
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,079
Rebecca, my dear girl,
my own little sister.

826
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,123
Tell me, I have a right to know.
I'm the head of the family now.

827
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:55,419
Alas, you force me.
It's so humiliating to talk of money.

828
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,546
Oh, dear, perhaps you're right.

829
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,306
Your secrets are your own.

830
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:05,103
Yes, why should I tell you that I need five
hundred pounds at once or else I'll kill myself.

831
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,732
You shouldn't, you mustn't. Even if you
did, I couldn't afford any more money.

832
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,233
Oh, I know, I know.

833
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,478
You've always been most generous.

834
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,944
Besides, someone else
has offered to help me.

835
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,400
Someone else, who?

836
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,402
Oh, a friend.

837
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:24,706
On second thought, you can have it, sister.

838
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,745
Brother!

839
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,581
But on a condition.

840
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,127
That you let me rescue you from
an unholy and imprudent connection.

841
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,125
I refer to the marquess of Steyne.

842
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:40,927
Promise me that. Dear Rebecca, promise me.
My conscience is against it. My conscience.

843
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:44,217
Your conscience is kissing my hand now.
With my brotherly love.

844
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,642
Oh, Rebecca, do you recall
how we read sermons together?

845
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,897
Couldn't we read a few soon?

846
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,277
Isn't the marquess of Steyne fortunate?
He has no conscience.

847
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,280
And as for brotherly
love, not an ounce of it.

848
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:08,917
Thus each performs her part, mamma,
the birds have found their voices,

849
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:13,167
if I'm to find five hundred pounds for you
we must discuss my part, hm?

850
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:19,504
The blowing Rose a flush, mamma,
her bonny cheek to dye...

851
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,764
Why do you sing, my dear?
It's such a prosaic matter.

852
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:26,305
I sing because I'm embarrassed
and I sing because I hate to beg.

853
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,553
I'm sorry I appear to make
it so difficult for you.

854
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,931
The money is at your disposal, of course.

855
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:35,353
What's it for this time? Pretty ribbons,
toast for your breakfast?

856
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,111
Or to save my name? Or charity?

857
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,317
Ah, charity! There we have it.

858
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,109
I'm trying to help an unfortunate man
with a deserving wife.

859
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:44,573
Perhaps you know them. The Crawley"s.

860
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,204
He got in a disagreeable mess at his club.

861
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,036
A gambling debt.

862
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:53,124
I'm delighted with the
opportunity to serve you.

863
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,547
If I give you this money

864
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,214
will you consider the possibility
of granting me this evening

865
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,297
that little supper that you've promised me
for so long now?

866
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,012
I've been very patient, you know.

867
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,349
I am sorry, but Rawdon and I planned
something else for this evening.

868
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:15,692
Will he not be going to the club in
a hurry to pay that unfortunate debt?

869
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,861
Perhaps.

870
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:26,657
He'll have to, won't he?

871
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,035
Yes.

872
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,962
Thank you, my dear.

873
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,051
And now, go on with your singing.
You sing most charmingly.

874
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:50,928
And there's sunshine in my heart, mamma,
which wakens and rejoices,

875
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:57,480
and so I sing and blush, mamma,
and that's the reason why...

876
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:01,191
And so I sing and blush, mamma,

877
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,375
No luck.
No? Did you try everybody?

878
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,038
Yes, everybody.

879
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,836
Come here.

880
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,671
Sit down.

881
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,510
Shut your eyes.

882
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,301
Now isn't that a wonderful surprise?

883
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:32,639
Wonderful.

884
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,600
Where did you get it?

885
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,977
Steyne? Nonsense!

886
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,359
Lord southdown came in this afternoon.
You know he owed me five hundred pounds.

887
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,854
No, I didn't. When did you discover it?

888
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:46,149
The moment he sent the money, silly.
He did? I thought he came over.

889
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,119
Well, both. He came over and...
He sent Fifine then with it.

890
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,615
Well, take it, darling. Be on your
way with it. There's no time to lose.

891
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,872
No, I suppose not.

892
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,831
Oh, darling, you've had a miserable day.
You need some amusement.

893
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,920
Would you like to stay at the club
this evening and play billiards?

894
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,461
Yes.

895
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,214
Rawdon, you're not taking the money.

896
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,134
Yes, I was going to leave the money,
wasn't I?

897
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,642
But you must go tonight.

898
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,188
Tonight, eh?
It would be quite serious if I didn't.

899
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,601
Tonight.

900
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,858
I agree with you.

901
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,525
Oh, Rawdon, it's our last debt.
We'll never have another...

902
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,023
Once this last debt is paid.

903
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:43,082
It really happened? It may have.

904
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,793
No sugar.
Thank you for remembering.

905
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,261
Ah, your little heart is flurried.
And my little head is in the clouds.

906
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,597
And your senses swim. Don't
leave that out, Becky.

907
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,142
In a sea of happiness.
I don't know what I am about.

908
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,562
I'll tell you.
You are about to eat a strawberry.

909
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,774
I saw you watching while
I was kissing your hand.

910
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,193
Milord, you've wounded me.
Do you question my emotions?

911
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,440
On the contrary.

912
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,654
I am flattered that a
midnight visit from the wolf

913
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:14,992
should prove so exciting to a lamb of your
coolness and self-possession.

914
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:19,080
I'm sorry to disappoint your lordship,
but this lamb is far from being excited.

915
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,043
She thinks there's some good in every wolf.

916
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,425
Poor, optimistic lamb.

917
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,346
What was that?

918
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,181
Somebody seen in the street, or quarreling,
or making love.

919
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,227
Why, you don't expect an intruder, do you?

920
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:46,145
No, returning husbands can
hardly be called intruders.

921
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,524
What a pity that yours
is forced to remain away.

922
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,526
You seem confident, milord.

923
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,824
I am.

924
01:03:55,915 --> 01:04:00,534
Curious enough, Mr. Crawley was arrested by
a bailiff just as he was entering his club.

925
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,627
Arrested?
So I have reason to believe.

926
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,458
Of course, I wasn't
there to see for myself.

927
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,623
It was the most unfortunate mistake.

928
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,042
In the morning the mistake
will be discovered.

929
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:13,008
There will be apologies and the whole thing
will be treated as a harmless little joke.

930
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,970
Only a joke? Then we are
free to enjoy the wine.

931
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:21,262
And with your wit and charm,
how easy it will be to forget everything.

932
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,930
Not everything, Becky.

933
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,726
You mustn't forget your ambitions.

934
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:26,893
Ambitions?

935
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,896
I've worked like a galley slave
to get into your fine society.

936
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,314
And what have I got for it?

937
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,530
The privilege of dining with
the dullest people in London.

938
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,493
You can't have ancestors and not be dull.

939
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,279
I'd rather be a parson's wife.

940
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,909
But you're not, Becky. You don't
cook and sew and mend stockings.

941
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,252
No, nor do I replenish the earth.

942
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,802
Therefore you must enjoy
life as you find it, Becky.

943
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,134
We mustn't be hypocrites, you know.

944
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,931
Otherwise, what would happen
to things like this little feast of ours?

945
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,470
This innocent little feast.

946
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:06,850
Milord, always your little generosities.

947
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,272
What beautiful pearls.

948
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:14,736
Didn't you hear something?
You heard your own wicked little heart.

949
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,946
No, no!
How did you do it, Becky?

950
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,195
How the devil did you ever catch my fancy

951
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,785
because there isn't an ounce of sweetness
or goodness about you.

952
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,623
That's your secret.

953
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,789
Wait, wait, we must drink to that.

954
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,038
To your marvelous portrait of me.
To your shrewd understanding.

955
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,298
Here's to...

956
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,851
Rawdon. Milord and I are having...

957
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,636
Milord and I...

958
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,807
You didn't go to the club.

959
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,104
When you left the house
you didn't go to the club.

960
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,813
A trap, hmm?

961
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:57,609
Mrs. Crawley's husband returns to his home
unexpectedly. He doesn't go to his club.

962
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,199
Well, sir, how much am I blackmailed for?

963
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,993
I've done nothing, I'm innocent.
Milord, tell him I'm innocent.

964
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,202
Innocent?

965
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:08,787
Come, what's the amount?
I've already paid five hundred...

966
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,379
For your absence.

967
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,374
No, no, Rawdon!

968
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,177
I'll make you pay for this.

969
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,551
You'll regret this to the end of your life.

970
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,059
Why bother?

971
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,810
Why squabble about something
that you don't own...

972
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,477
And I don't want.

973
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,196
Rawdon, listen to me.
If I've ever done anything...

974
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,452
Those pearls, take them off.

975
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:43,992
I'll explain, I have nothing to hide.
All the world might have been here...

976
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,661
Don't hate me!

977
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,876
Oh, let them go, I don't want them.
It's only you I want.

978
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,369
I love you, I love you...

979
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,290
I won't let you go! I'll fight for you!

980
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:56,041
I couldn't have done anything else.

981
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,757
I had to help, I had to do
something for you, for both of us.

982
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,592
Don't hate me, try to understand.

983
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:04,429
All right, darling, I'm yours.
Nothing else matters.

984
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:07,224
My love for you is the only real thing
that I have in my life.

985
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:09,267
Don't take that away from me!

986
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,852
Don't leave Mel
you can't leave me, I'm your wife!

987
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:19,156
You're not my wife!
Just someone I was once married to.

988
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,491
But that's over with!

989
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,076
Rawdon!

990
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,458
Oh, Rawdon!

991
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:45,430
They'll all laugh at Mel
oh, how they'll laugh!

992
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,949
Oh, I love windy!

993
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,989
Oh, I love Nelly.

994
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:49,906
Up, windy! Up, windy!

995
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:57,831
Capital! Capital!
I had no idea these places existed.

996
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,548
The seamy side of life, me boy.

997
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:03,211
The seamy side, eh?
We've been watching the seams.

998
01:09:14,191 --> 01:09:17,854
Young Molly who lives
at the foot of the hill

999
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:22,905
whose fame every maiden
with envy doth fill.

1000
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,907
No, my eyes are tricking me,
that's Mrs. Crawley! Becky!

1001
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,452
She's been out of England. She's
either come back or I'm seeing things.

1002
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,750
I've had my fill of your singing too.

1003
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,711
Here, here, don't annoy her ladyship.

1004
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:46,254
They call her the lass
with the delicate air.

1005
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,970
I say, I'm delicate. See how delicate I am.

1006
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:56,514
Then tell me ye swains who have conquered
the fair.

1007
01:09:56,567 --> 01:10:01,186
How to win the dear lass
with the delicate air.

1008
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:04,988
Delicate! That was my trouble.

1009
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,823
How to win the dear lass...

1010
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,371
With the delicate air.

1011
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,542
How to win the dear lass with the...

1012
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,418
Delicate air.

1013
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:41,229
With the delicate air.

1014
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,454
Out! Out with you!
You impostor!

1015
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:00,165
You fraud! You've disgraced my house!

1016
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,288
The finest place in bath.

1017
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,378
A pigsty, run by a hog for swine.

1018
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:07,551
And what are you? A lady!

1019
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:23,017
That's right, dearie, read the cards.

1020
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:27,112
Ask them where to find the money
for the landlord.

1021
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:29,819
'Cause you pay today, or out you go.

1022
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,909
Tell him I'll settle tomorrow.

1023
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,703
Do you think he'll believe that?

1024
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,916
He knows all about what happened
to the great singer last night.

1025
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,160
I'm expecting a remittance any day now.

1026
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:43,958
I've written to my brother
who's a rich man, a baronet.

1027
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:48,710
Your brother, eh?
I used to call them me cousins.

1028
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,758
I had an Earl and a count.

1029
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:54,131
You wouldn't think it, would you,
looking at me now.

1030
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:59,308
But I was a dancer.
I had me home in park Lane.

1031
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,557
Me jewels, me carriages.

1032
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,478
Now I got me broom and me scrubbing brush.

1033
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:10,273
There won't be any brush for me nor broom,
you old crow.

1034
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,317
It's not in the cards.

1035
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:16,996
The king of hearts... Rawdon...
See how close we are to each other?

1036
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,748
There's the king of spades between them.

1037
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,539
The king of spades. He
always keeps us apart.

1038
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,255
Well, you can forget about it if you drink
enough Brandy.

1039
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,341
Superstition, nonsense.

1040
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,553
I'm not the queen of hearts and Rawdon's
not the king.

1041
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:36,261
Who cares? Cards won't
bring him back, anyway.

1042
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,136
Then why do you sit here
wishing and sighing?

1043
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,058
Because I dream and I don't want to dream.

1044
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:45,019
I don't want to see him
shipwrecked, killed, dying of fever.

1045
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,230
The Ace of spades.

1046
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,651
Do you think he's dead?

1047
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,986
Cards never lie.

1048
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,798
Now what the devil?

1049
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,671
Perhaps we're not welcome.

1050
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,631
Here!

1051
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,680
Mrs. Crawley.

1052
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,143
Becky!

1053
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,849
Come in!

1054
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,895
Becky! What a time I had finding you.

1055
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:34,691
What happened to you after the theater
last night? Did you fly off in a balloon?

1056
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:39,616
Becky, you mustn't look away. Amy, how
can I face you here, looking like this?

1057
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,998
Ah! Joseph, my gentle friend.

1058
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,117
Now, that's better.
Thought you were going to throw me out.

1059
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,871
That brush in my stomach
wasn't very cordial.

1060
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:50,588
Amy, what are you doing here?
Why did you come?

1061
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,374
Nothing could have kept me away.

1062
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,835
When Joseph came home and said
that he'd seen you...

1063
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:58,135
I said, "Amy, I've just
seen Becky cutting capers."

1064
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,050
She said, "you didn't",
I said, "I did, capers."

1065
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,641
We'd have gone on arguing for hours,
but dobbin arrived with a pineapple.

1066
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,555
Dobbin? Is he with you?

1067
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:10,021
Are you married to him?
Oh, no, he just happened to accompany us.

1068
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:14,362
He's been happening for years.
What I mean to say is, accompanying Amy.

1069
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:18,074
At this very moment he's down in the
taproom accompanying a mug of beer.

1070
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:20,865
He wouldn't come up, he still remembers.

1071
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:24,077
Don't, Becky, the past must be forgotten.

1072
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,491
Not there, dear, it's such a mess!

1073
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:31,213
I've been too sick, too dejected
to put things in order.

1074
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:34,591
It doesn't matter, dear. We always
used to sit on the bed for our talks.

1075
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:37,548
Come sit by me. Amelia.

1076
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,350
Becky...

1077
01:14:41,768 --> 01:14:44,601
I still have your little bed.
It's in my house.

1078
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,771
How would you like to have it again
for your very own?

1079
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:51,517
I offer it to you with
all the old affection.

1080
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:52,859
Amelia!

1081
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:55,653
you can't stay here. Come live with me.

1082
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,773
Oh, this is a dream.

1083
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,067
Dream, eh? Well, it isn't.

1084
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,702
Leave us, Jos.
Go down to dobbin in the taproom.

1085
01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:05,118
Becky and I have much to say that's not
for strange ears.

1086
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:09,331
My ears are strange? They're the same ones
I've worn for forty years.

1087
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,622
Did you mean what you said?

1088
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,461
Do you know what you're doing for me?

1089
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,710
You're saving me from myself, from this.

1090
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:21,134
From Pitt, with his leering charity
and his clammy hands.

1091
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,515
I've written him a letter,
pleading for money.

1092
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,929
You have no need of him now.

1093
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,723
No, I can go with you.

1094
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:30,268
Oh, for the first time
in years I'm happy again.

1095
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,683
I can breathe. You've done this for me.

1096
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,601
You, Amy, you.

1097
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:38,230
You've been like a sister to me, always.

1098
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:40,993
Come in.

1099
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,328
You decided to come up, after all.

1100
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:50,955
Amelia! Joseph has just told me
that you've asked Mrs. Crawley to...

1101
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:53,336
Oh, I knew it. It was too good to last.

1102
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,068
That you've asked her to
come and live with you.

1103
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:56,753
He told you the truth, William.

1104
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,571
Becky is the oldest friend
I have in the world.

1105
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,337
She wasn't always a friend to you.
I don't care to remember that.

1106
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,926
Isn't there such a thing as forgiveness?

1107
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:06,141
Forgive her if you will, help her, give
her money, but don't take her with you.

1108
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:10,270
She needs me. She's hard, she's
selfish, she'll take advantage of you.

1109
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:14,688
As your friend I can't let you do this.
Promise me you won't.

1110
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:19,314
I've given you the devotion of a lifetime.
This is the only favor I've ever asked of you.

1111
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,324
If you deny me,
this will mean the end of our friendship.

1112
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,201
I must do what's right.

1113
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,829
Then, goodbye.

1114
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,413
William!

1115
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,046
You're in love with the man.

1116
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,968
You can't live without him.
It would break your heart to lose him.

1117
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:51,978
Amy, I'm not coming home with you.

1118
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,515
I'll not let you do this.
I'll send you back to dobbin...

1119
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,062
No matter how much he's hated me.

1120
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:57,859
Don't give up, love.

1121
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:01,230
Don't let it be taken from
you by me or anybody else.

1122
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:04,199
Fight for it, keep it.
It doesn't come often.

1123
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:07,361
But you...
Don't worry about me. I'll manage.

1124
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:11,490
Go downstairs, he'll be waiting for you.
Take his hand. Ask him to marry you.

1125
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,334
I can't. I'll never marry him.

1126
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:17,291
You will, why shouldn't you?
Because of George.

1127
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,507
I must be true to his memory, to his love.

1128
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,923
Love, why you fool, you monkey,
he never really loved you.

1129
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,587
He did! I'll prove it to you.

1130
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,201
No matter what you say, I think he did.

1131
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:31,393
He was never faithful to you. He made
love to me when you were hardly married.

1132
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:35,431
Your husband in heaven... here it is.

1133
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,977
You know the handwriting.
He wrote this to me.

1134
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,695
Sent it to me in Brussels right under
your unsuspecting little nose.

1135
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:46,032
Now you know. Now you're free
to forget the past.

1136
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:49,324
Go to the man who really loves you.
Marry him!

1137
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,738
Go on, go on!

1138
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:55,080
I say, Amy, did you and
dobbin have a breeze?

1139
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:56,993
Jos, you're drunk.

1140
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,213
Drunk? I, drunk?

1141
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,420
This is an "unjustice".

1142
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,760
Am I her only brother?

1143
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:09,097
Similarly, is she my only sister?

1144
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:12,680
Similarly, where is she running to?

1145
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:14,219
To dobbin. She's going to marry him.

1146
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,356
What?

1147
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:19,358
Why, I... think that's beautiful.

1148
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:22,361
What's the matter with you?
What have you lost?

1149
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,897
Lost my heart out of my bosom.

1150
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:28,283
To see my sister blessed
with such happiness.

1151
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:32,450
Why weep? They'll be happy but they haven't
stolen all the happiness in the world.

1152
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:33,913
I think they have.

1153
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,418
Would you like to sit down and be
just as happy as they are?

1154
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,463
Yes.

1155
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:41,337
Do you like Brandy, Joseph?

1156
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,462
How will it sit with the beer in me?

1157
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,839
Perfect! Extra fine cognac.

1158
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:50,431
And we have biscuits and golden doughnuts.
We'll have a feast.

1159
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:53,717
Do you mind sharing the plate with me?
No. Quite the contrary.

1160
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,970
I'll even share the bottle.

1161
01:18:56,022 --> 01:19:00,140
I have only one knife, I'm ashamed
to admit. Isn't it enchanting?

1162
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,111
Enchanting? You're enchanting too.

1163
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,947
Drink hearty, drink deep.

1164
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,904
A million years have passed
since we drank together.

1165
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,862
Or sat together undisturbed.

1166
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:17,783
Returning glance for
glance, smile for smile.

1167
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,999
Golden doughnut for golden doughnut.

1168
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:26,046
To the happy two people.
To the memory of the past.

1169
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,294
And the joy of the present.

1170
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:32,635
When two people meet again and they agree.
That's it!

1171
01:19:32,684 --> 01:19:36,347
Agree!
Honors to our sentiments, Becky!

1172
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:40,856
To pitch their little tent or little
cottage with the trees, the stars above...

1173
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:44,018
Honors to the stars above!

1174
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:49,524
And the murmuring of moonlit streams
and the perfume of love...

1175
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:52,867
Does that fetch you, you dear, gay fellow?

1176
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:54,827
It's you that are gay, Becky.

1177
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,910
Gay and... gallant.

1178
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,909
Come, come closer, Becky.

1179
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,998
Jos, you frighten me. You're so intense.

1180
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,085
Intense, but honorable, Becky.

1181
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,464
Tell me, are you a widow?

1182
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:14,090
Yes, or no, because you must become...

1183
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,757
My widow next.

1184
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,760
Later, later we'll talk about it.

1185
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,888
Now you must help me pack.
I've had enough of all this. We're going!

1186
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:25,563
Going? Where? Mayfair, India, anywhere!
Away from all this.

1187
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,853
We can't, Becky, I have no money.

1188
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,862
No money? You're poor?

1189
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:36,862
Who dares accuse Joseph
"Waterloo" Sedley of poverty?

1190
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:39,455
No, it's just that I have no cash.

1191
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:43,460
We'll have to wait here for a week
until my next month's allowance comes.

1192
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,917
But I can't wait.
The landlord will have me jailed by then.

1193
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,216
Speak of the devil. Who's there?

1194
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,423
It's I, Rebecca. And Jane.

1195
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:57,550
They're here. My letter, they've come.

1196
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,974
What shall I do?
Let me throw them out.

1197
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:04,599
Wait! Perhaps they are
a blessing in disguise.

1198
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,858
Becky! Sister! Brother!

1199
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:09,986
The money we need. I'll get it from Pitt.

1200
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:14,108
Oh, darling James. I can't
believe it's really you.

1201
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,277
One moment. I must make myself presentable.

1202
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,704
Climb out the window.

1203
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,082
If Pitt finds you here,
I'll never get the money from him.

1204
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:26,541
Climb out!
I can't. The cheers have gone to my head.

1205
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:30,419
I'm almost ready, quite ready.

1206
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:34,010
Here... hurry!

1207
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:39,721
Oh, this bliss, this happiness!

1208
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,303
Oh, Jane.

1209
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:44,141
My Jane.

1210
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,183
My forgiving kinsman, to see you again.

1211
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:51,444
To feel my hand in yours
after such a long time.

1212
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:54,947
Your letter came, Rebecca. Our hearts
we were deeply touched by your plight.

1213
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,573
My prayers have been answered.
Yes, we've come to rescue you.

1214
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:02,539
To restore you to the bosom of our family,
to the tranquility of queen's Crawley.

1215
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,249
Queen's Crawley? Oh, I'm overcome.

1216
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:08,378
Before we do that, my dear,
you must cleanse your soul.

1217
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:12,257
Rebecca, would it not make you happy
to go to church with us?

1218
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,875
Before we talk of anything else?

1219
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,592
Oh, I'd go happily, happily.
As soon as I settle with the landlord.

1220
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,599
He'll not let me leave the house
until I pay him the money I owe him.

1221
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:25,972
Isn't the peace of your soul more urgent?
Yes, but so is the landlord urgent.

1222
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:30,149
I trust it's not a large amount.

1223
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,394
No. Two hundred pounds.

1224
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,150
Settle with him for thirty-five.

1225
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,281
One hundred and fifty?
Fifty then.

1226
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,489
Make it a hundred, brother.
Then we can go and listen to the sermon.

1227
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,198
Thank you.

1228
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,823
What was that? Aren't you alone?

1229
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:48,619
Alone, always alone. It
must have been a mouse.

1230
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,839
Now, dear, get your bonnet and come.
To regain peace.

1231
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,426
Yes, regain... peace...

1232
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:59,759
Oh... peace... regain...

1233
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:03,926
Oh, what's wrong? Oh, dear.

1234
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:07,680
My heart. The excitement
of seeing you again.

1235
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:12,560
Water. Oh, no, perhaps I'll
feel better soon if I rest.

1236
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:17,990
Yes, rest. And I shall stay with you
and care for you in your need.

1237
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,721
Oh, no, you mustn't. I'd never forgive
myself if you missed the service.

1238
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:25,535
You must go, dear. I'm used to my solitude.
Please go and come back for me later.

1239
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,120
Come, dear, Rebecca is overwrought.
Soon as she rests she will be better.

1240
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,585
This book of moral precepts
that we brought you...

1241
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:34,839
When you're better, read and profit.
The title is "rewards of virtue."

1242
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:37,466
Until later then, poor child.

1243
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,552
Rest well.

1244
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,477
One hundred pounds. And I
owe the landlord twelve.

1245
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,100
Don't stand there blinking at me.
We must get out of here.

1246
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:57,320
I'm not blinking. That's love.
The trunk's for our love.

1247
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:00,656
Put those letters in then lock it.
We're going. Going.

1248
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:05,905
India. Rich places. Taxes to collect.
Butterflies and elephants.

1249
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:09,457
Fine rajahs in rubies and gold.

1250
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,414
The book! The book!

1251
01:24:13,339 --> 01:24:17,127
Pitt! Brother! Yes, Rebecca?

1252
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:23,381
My deepest gratitude, brother,
for virtue is its own reward!
