Well, what are the causes?

6
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:12,758
Why are we Americans on the march?

7
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:15,720
Is it because of

What turned our resources, our machines,

our whole nation into one vast arsenal,

49
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,776

on every continent and every ocean?

54
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,890
What are these two worlds
of which Mr. Wallace spoke?

The free and the slave.

Let's take the free
world first, our world.

How did it become free?

58
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,195
Only through a long and unceasing struggle

Forbid it almighty God.

give me liberty or give me death.

- [Narrator] But what of this other world?

96
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,062
Here men insisted that progress
lay in killing freedom.

97
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,234
Here they were putting out
the lighthouses, one by one.

98
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,239
Here the march of history
was reversing itself.

99
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:29,992
In Italy it began when an
ambitious rabble-rouser

100
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,994
set his followers marching on Rome.

101
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,625
The country, like every other country

102
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,754
after the last war, was
torn by political unrest,

103
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,757
hard times, unemployment.

104
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,013
Two courses were available
to the Italian people.

105
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,475
They could solve their problems
in a free, democratic way,

106
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,603
or they could let someone
else do the solving for them.

107
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,190
They made the tragic mistake
of choosing the second course.

108
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,234
They put their trust and
faith in this one man.

109
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,445
They believed he represented them.

110
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,615
Actually he planned to betray
them for the selfish interest

111
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,284
of himself and the group back of him

112
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,578
just as he had earlier betrayed

113
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,205
those who first supported him.

114
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,751
In Germany another even
more forceful demagogue

115
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,213
sent his followers marching
from the Munich beer halls.

116
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,716
He too had the sinister
opportunity to take advantage

117
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,259
of post-war chaos.

118
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,397
But he also had certain
distinctive German characteristics

119
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,314
to play on.

120
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,777
To start with, the Germans
have an inborn national love

121
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:49,405
of regimentation and a harsh discipline.

122
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,614
He could give them that.

123
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,499
The German Army, and through them

124
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,335
the people, have never
acknowledged German defeat

125
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,588
in the last war and were
anxious for revenge.

126
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,966
That, too, he promised them.

127
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,844
The wealthy and powerful
industrialists were fearful

128
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,971
of losing any of their wealth and power,

129
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,391
and were ready to back anyone
who would retain it for them.

130
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,268
He promised to take care of them, too.

131
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,102
(crowd cheering)

132
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,981
This man cunningly played all
these ends against the middle,

133
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,357
and ruthlessly set out
(guns firing)

134
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,359
to murder the newborn German republic.

135
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,529
(crowd shouting)

136
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,907
In Japan you expect things to
be done a little differently.

137
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:34,867
They were.

138
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:35,701
(somber patriotic music)

139
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,037
Here, not one man, but a gang,

140
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,623
disguised their little schemes
as the will of the Emperor,

141
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,043
and to the Japanese
people, the Emperor is God.

142
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,756
Taking advantage of
their fanatical worship

143
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,841
of the God-Emperor, it was no great trick

144
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,552
to take away what little
freedom they had ever known.

145
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,514
Yes, in these lands the people
surrendered their liberties

146
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:59,349
and threw away their human dignity.

147
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:03,520
(shouting in Japanese)

148
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,570
They gave up their rights
as individual human beings

149
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,741
Sieg Heil!

150
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:19,912
And became a part of a mass, a human herd.

151
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,083
(shouting in Italian)

152
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,421
Although these countries
were far apart and different

153
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,006
in custom and in language,

154
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,133
the same poison made them much alike.

155
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,594
Each got a new uniform.

156
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,555
In Italy, the new bosses
wore black shirts.

157
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,600
In Germany, the shirts were brown.

158
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,937
In Japan, they hid behind
the uniform of the Army,

159
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,898
but really, they belonged to
a sinister secret society.

160
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,359
Their symbol was a black dragon.

161
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,527
(dramatic music)

162
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,862
The other fellows had
to have a symbol, too.

163
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,781
Germany, a swastika.

164
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,160
In Italy, the old Roman
symbol of the fasces.

165
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,789
In Germany they called the new order

166
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,417
national socialism, or Nazism.

167
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,587
(dramatic music)

168
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,966
In Italy, they had a
shorter word, fascism.

169
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,263
In Japan, they had lots of names for it.

170
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:23,475
The New Era of Enlightenment,
the New Order in Asia,

171
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,978
the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

172
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,272
But no matter how you slice it,

173
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,317
it was just plain old-fashioned
militaristic imperialism.

174
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,945
The Japs would get the Prosperity,

175
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,613
and the others would get the crow.

176
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,242
They say trouble always comes in threes.

Take a good, close look at this trio.

Remember these faces,

180
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,459
remember them well.

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,754
If you ever meet them, don't hesitate.

182

and follow me!" cried Hitler.

184
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,642
I will make you masters of the world!

185
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,186
And the people answered
Sieg Heil!

186
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:12,065
Sieg Heil!

187
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,025
(speaking Italian)

188
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,111
Stop thinking and believe
in me! bellowed Mussolini.

189
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,363
And I will restore the
glory that was Rome!

190
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,616
And the people answered
Il Duce, Il Duce!

191
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,994
(shouting in Italian)

192
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:24,828
(speaking Japanese)

193
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,872
Stop thinking and follow your God-Emperor!

194
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,124
cried the Japanese warlords.

195
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,585
And Japan will rule the world!

196
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,295
And the people answered
Banzai, Banzai!

197
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,673
Banzai, Banzai!

198
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,217
Each system was alike in that

199
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,304
the constitutional lawmaking
bodies gave up their power.

200
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:47,100
The Reichstag in Berlin, the
House of Deputies in Rome,

201
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,810
the Diet in Tokyo.

202
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,648
And these elected representatives
became collections

203
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,984
of stooges, rubber stamp organizations.

204
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:59,947
Sieg Heil!

205
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,783
Applauding on cue the
words of the leaders.

206
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,617
(crowd applauding)

207
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,744
- [Narrator] Each system
did away with free speech

208
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:06,912
and free assembly.

209
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,791
Each system did away with a free press,

210
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,877
and substituted a press
controlled by the Party.

211
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,796
Through their ministries of propaganda,

212
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,340
each took complete control of the theater,

213
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,425
the movies, the radio.

214
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,179
Every cultural activity and
every channel of information

215
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,724
was controlled by the most
important members of the Party.

216
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,395
Each did away with free
courts and trial by jury,

217
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,523
and substituted courts and
judges run by the Party.

218
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,776
Each abolished labor unions and the rights

219
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,319
of bargaining for wages.

220
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,155
(officer whistling)

221
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:46,326
(speaking German)

222
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,296
Heil Hitler!

223
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,007
(speaking German)

224
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,800
And under the pretext of patriotism

225
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,511
established a system of forced labor.

226
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,931
Each enforced its decrees
by an army of secret police

227
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,891
who held the power of life and death

228
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,977
over every individual.

229
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,480
And for the few who still
believed in freedom and said so,

230
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,066
there was a ready answer.

231
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:29,119
(speaking Italian)

232
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,247
The greatest intellect in the world

233
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,458
can be silenced with this.

234
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,044
That is an exact translation of the words

235
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,254
these black-shirts cheer so lustily.

236
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:44,217
(speaking German)

237
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,137
- [Narrator] Whenever
I hear anyone mention

238
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:51,141
the word culture, the first
thing I do is reach for my gun.

239
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:56,980
Yes, they had the answer,
the blackjack, and the gun.

240
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,814
(gun firing)

241
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,650
(dramatic music)

242
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,446
(gun firing)

243
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,496
(guns firing)

244
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,546
In Italy, they did it different.

245
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,885
(gun firing)

246
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,763
(dramatic music)

247
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,435
While in Japan...

248
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,482
(guns firing)

249
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,033
To their names can be added
those of hundreds and thousands

250
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:52,828
of others who stood in
the way of the New Order.

251
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,415
Finally there was only one obstacle left.

252
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,167
(bells ringing)

253
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,968
(choral music)

254
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,441
The word of God and the word of fuhrers

255
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,234
cannot be reconciled.

256
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,944
Then God must go!

257
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:30,991
(glass shattering)
(dramatic music)

258
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,412
- [Translator] I am absolutely
clear in my own mind

259
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,165
and I think I can speak
for the Führer as well,

260
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,333
that both the Catholic
and Protestant churches

261
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,878
must vanish from the life of our people.

262
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,547
- [Narrator] Thus spoke
Doctor Alfred Rosenberg,

263
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,633
and if you have any doubt
that he spoke for his Führer,

264
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,177
here's what happened.

265
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:13,116
♪ O come, all ye faithful ♪

266
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:19,206
♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪

267
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,375
♪ O come ye ♪

268
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:25,587
♪ O come ye ♪

269
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:30,675
♪ To Bethlehem ♪

270
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,262
♪ Come and ♪

271
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,640
- [Narrator] Thousands
of other men of God,

272
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,267
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish,

273
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,311
were persecuted, arrested,

274
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,605
confined in concentration camps.

275
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,234
- [Translator] Our Führer
is the intermediary

276
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,903
between his people and the throne of God.

277
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,363
Everything the Führer utters

278
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,989
is religion in the highest sense.

279
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:53,949
(speaking German)

280
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,159
It is only on one or
two exceptional points

281
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,620
that Christ and Hitler stand comparison,

282
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,081
for Hitler is far too
big a man to be compared

283
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,457
with one so petty.

284
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,168
- [Narrator] Every day in
all German classrooms...

285
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:09,214
(singing in German)

286
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,869
Yes, take children from
the faith of their fathers

287
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,872
and teach them the
State is the only church

288
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,668
and the head of the State
is the voice of God.

289
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,839
(chanting in Japanese)

290
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,762
(patriotic music)

291
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:48,618
That was the way of life,
or better, the way of death,

292
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,245
in that other world.

293
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,373
Now what of our world,
the democratic world?

294
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,624
What did we want?
(gentle music)

295
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,209
What did we do about it?

296
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,753
First of all we wanted peace and security.

297
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,757
And to prove our sincerity, in 1921,

298
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,885
we initiated the Washington
Disarmament Conference.

299
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,097
This resulted in two
vitally important treaties.

300
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,101
One to reduce the size
of the British, Japanese,

301
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,354
French, Italian, and American fleets.

302
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,940
And the other, The Nine-Power
Treaty, which guaranteed

303
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,776
the integrity of China, and incidentally,

304
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,153
one of the powers signing this was Japan.

305
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:29,534
Later on in 1929, we signed
the Kellogg-Briand Pact,

306
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,077
which was supposed to abolish war

307
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,162
as a means of settling
international disputes.

308
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,080
(audience applauding)

309
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,250
This pact was signed by 47 nations,

310
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,960
including Germany and Japan.

311
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,797
- Mr. President, I have
the honor of handing you

312
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,091
the London Naval Treaty.

313
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,552
- [Narrator] Faithful to
our treaty obligations

314
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,638
(explosion booming)

315
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:00,440
we scrapped more than
60% of our naval tonnage.

316
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:05,320
And our army was reduced to a
standing force of 136,000 men.

317
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,406
Smaller than that maintained
by the little state of Romania.

318
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,952
We let our hopes for
peace become so strong

319
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,746
that they grew into a determination

320
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,664
not to fight unless directly attacked.

321
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,293
We let ourselves be
influenced by those who said

322
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,754
that we could find
security through isolation.

323
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:23,588
(patriotic music)

324
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,965
The confusion in our way
of thinking is apparent

325
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,968
in the slice of public
opinion as it appeared

326
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,803
in Pathe News in 1939.

327
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,022
- Another war, not for me.

328
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,776
This time America should
keep out and I know I will.

329
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,527
- If war breaks out in Europe,

330
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,113
I think that this country
should heed the advice

331
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:53,326
of its first president, and
avoid all foreign entanglements.

332
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,537
- I haven't the slightest
idea of European affairs.

333
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,749
- In the event of war in Europe,

334
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,043
I think we should stay out of it entirely.

335
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,921
- And all our efforts
should be made to keep out

336
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,130
of the fight.

337
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,799
- Let Europe fight her own battles.

338
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,008
They mean nothing to us.

339
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,343
- We should mind our own business!

340
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,678
- By all means, no.

341
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:12,512
- Yes, fight!

342
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,346
- No.

343
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,180
- No.

344
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:15,014
- Yes.

345
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,557
- If my country calls, yes.

346
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,475
- No!

347
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,647
- [Narrator] We simply
did not want to understand

348
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,608
that our individual and
national problems were,

349
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:28,903
and always will be,
dependent upon the problems

350
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:29,988
of the whole world.

351
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:30,905
("America, The Beautiful")

352
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,409
And we had individual and
national problems to worry about.

353
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,702
Plenty of them,

354
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,496
just as Germany, Italy, and Japan had.

355
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,915
But we faced them in a democratic way.

356
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,668
We passed laws to give working men

357
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,461
a chance to improve their lot.

358
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,342
We established an insurance
program for those without jobs.

359
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,015
We began to give old folks protection

360
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,307
against want and hunger.

361
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:02,478
We organized the CCC to
provide our young men

362
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,313
with healthy and useful employment.

363
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,109
(saw buzzing)

364
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,946
A federal works program came
into being and changed the face

365
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:16,367
of our nation with new
roads, bridges, schools.

366
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,624
We built great new dams which brought

367
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,377
the miracle of electricity
to millions of our people.

368
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,132
These were some of our accomplishments,

369
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,676
but there were others not so creditable.

370
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:34,761
We turned our backs
(dark somber music)

371
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,471
on the League of Nations.

372
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,889
We passed The Tariff Act to set

373
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,141
a higher wall of isolation around us.

374
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,520
We encouraged lawlessness
with the farce of Prohibition.

375
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,565
But in spite of these mistakes,
we never had a thought

376
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,901
of losing our free institutions.

377
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,195
John Q. Public still ran the country.

378
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,364
He had his choice of
voting for Dewey, Willkie,

379
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,241
Roosevelt, or anybody else.

380
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,993
In Germany they had the choice of voting

381
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,871
for Hitler, Hitler, or Hitler.

382
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,373
(dark music)

383
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,421
Over here, John Q.

384
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,839
Still read what he pleased.

385
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,842
And although he heard
of books being burned

386
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,344
in other countries, he would've laughed

387
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,222
if anyone had told him his
books would ever be burned.

388
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,058
(dramatic music)

389
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:34,821
(bells ringing)

390
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,198
And on Sunday, if he felt
like it, John Q. went

391
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:41,035
to any church he pleased.

(children chattering)
(lighthearted music)

404
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,713
- [Narrator] Most of all,
he got a kick out of seeing

405
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,630
his kids grow up.

406
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:38,634
(children shouting)

407
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,864
- [Boy] Run, Jerry!

408
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:10,249
(boys shouting)
(referee whistling)

409
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,214
- [Narrator] The average
American was quite unconscious

410
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,675
of the fact that some
people had this in mind

411
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,636
for the little John Qs.

412
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,930
(speaking German)

413
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:55,920
Yes, while their children
were being trained to kill,

414
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,964
John Q's kids were giving their pennies

415
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,465
to help them have life.

416
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,594
(patriotic music)

417
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,188
And when we saw these
men on the newsreels,

418
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,856
quite often, we laughed.

419
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,693
To us, they looked like
characters in a musical comedy.

420
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:20,945
(crowd cheering)

421
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,660
But they weren't comic.

422
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,078
They weren't funny.

423
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,080
They were deadly serious.

424
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,832
They were out for world conquest.

425
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,085
And what made it deadly serious was

426
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:38,838
that there were 70 million Japanese,

427
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,508
45 million Italians,
and 80 million Germans

428
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:45,136
all hopped up with the same idea.

429
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,307
(speaking German)

430
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,436
Their leaders told them
that they were supermen,

431
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,855
Herrenvolk the Nazis called it,

432
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,190
the master race, destined to rule

433
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,109
all other peoples on Earth.

434
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,570
Sieg Heil!

435
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,239
Take a good look at these humorless men.

436
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:07,658
These were to be the
rulers of the ruling race.

437
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,787
(speaking German)

438
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,418
Obey us blindly and you will attain

439
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,712
your rightful place in the world.

440
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,590
All other people will be your slaves.

441
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,383
That's what they promised them.

442
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:29,263
That Americans, Chinese,
Russian, South Americans,

443
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:32,558
all free peoples would work
for them and make them rich.

444
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:33,809
And how they ate it up.

445
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:37,938
(chanting in Japanese, German, Italian)

446
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,695
We shall restore the glory that was Rome.

447
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,865
(chanting in Italian)

448
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:51,452
Today we rule Germany, tomorrow the world.

449
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,621
(crowd cheering)

450
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,164
The Pacific is ours.

451
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:58,084
(chanting in Japanese)

452
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,253
It was inevitable that these
countries should gang up on us.

453
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:03,839
The little fella is our pal Kurusu,

454
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:07,843
who smiled his way into our
hearts in December 1941.

455
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,429
Here he and his friends are
busy carving up the world

456
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,557
in advance, staking out their claims.

457
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,601
Take a good look at these claims.

458
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,186
- [Narrator] Here was the Italy

459
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:20,064
that Mussolini took over in 1922.

460
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,817
And almost his first act
was to tell the Italians

461
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,111
they were the rightful owners of Corsica,

462
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,157
Nice, Savoie, Albania,

463
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:34,370
Tunisia, Ethiopia, and a land corridor

464
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,247
linking it with Libya.

465
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,833
Later on he had an even bigger dream,

466
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:43,546
the old Roman Empire as it
existed nearly 2000 years ago,

467
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,507
to dominate all the lands
adjoining the Mediterranean.

468
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,387
'Mare Nostra'
Our sea, they called it,

469
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,931
just as the ancient Romans did.

470
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,141
- [Narrator] As for the Japanese,

471
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,560
they had some ambitions too.

472
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,313
By 1920 they had grabbed
off Formosa, Korea,

473
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,816
and the southern half of
the island of Sakhalin.

474
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,736
Then Baron Giichi Tanaka,
the Prime Minister,

475
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,573
carefully set down
Japanese aims in a document

476
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,241
called The Tanaka Memorial.

477
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,287
It was presented to the
Emperor July 25th, 1927.

478
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,257
Here was their dream,
Manchuria for raw materials,

479
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,551
China for manpower,

480
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,887
Then a triumphant march through Indochina,

481
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:37,308
Siam, Burma, India, the East Indies,

482
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,643
then on through Australia and New Zealand.

483
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,228
And in the north all they claimed

484
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,522
was that part of Russia
east of Lake Baikal.

485
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,234
That was to be the new order in Asia.

486
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,154
(ominous music)

487
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,531
Then the Japs would move eastward to crush

488
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,700
the United States and really start

489
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:57,244
their Co-Prosperity Sphere.

490
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,370
Now take a look at the bite

491
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,831
the Nazis reserved for themselves.

492
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,917
Here's the Germany Hitler walked into.

493
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,127
And here is what he wanted.

494
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:08,130
First Europe under his complete political

495
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,592
or economic control,
leaving Mussolini a share

496
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,177
of the loot if he behaved himself.

497
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,932
Then the drive to the east

498
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,685
through the rich oil-lands
of Iran and Iraq into India.

499
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,522
Another push south through Africa.

500
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,362
Then from Dakar, jump off
to meet the honorary Aryans,

501
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,032
who were to move in on South
America through the Pacific.

502
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:36,784
At the same time, start across

503
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,495
from the Scandinavian countries to hook up

504
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,915
with his bucktooth pals
coming over from Siberia,

505
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,626
to join in the conquest
of the United States.

506
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:47,920
- [Narrator] There it is, gents.

507
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,339
All they left us was Shangri-La.

508
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,092
And they'd claim that too,
if they knew where it was.

509
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,011
And did they think they had a chance?

510
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,012
- [Narrator] Listen.

511
00:34:57,221 --> 00:35:01,141
(Speaking Japanese)

512
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,311
- [Narrator] When war comes between Japan

513
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,814
and the United States,
I shall not be content

514
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,775
merely to occupy Guam, the Philippines,

515
00:35:09,984 --> 00:35:12,194
Hawaii, and San Francisco.

516
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,280
I look forward to dictating the peace

517
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:17,324
to the United States in the
White House at Washington.

518
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:21,412
Yamamoto wrote those
words on January of 1941.

519
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:26,458
Yes, the conquering Jap Army
down Pennsylvania Avenue.

520
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,502
That was the final goal.

521
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:31,380
You will see what they did to
the men and women of Nanking,

522
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,215
Hong Kong, and Manila.

523
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:34,883
Imagine the field day they'd
enjoy if they'd marched

524
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:37,595
through the streets of Washington.

525
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,974
But before striking, a
preliminary step was necessary.

526
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,812
From Berlin, from Rome,

527
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,523
from Tokyo, the campaign started.

528
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:53,694
Propaganda, to confuse, divide,

529
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,571
soften up their intended victim.

530
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,531
Put them on the defensive.

531
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,993
Scream you're abused,
shout you're oppressed.

532
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,911
The world's wrong, you're right!

533
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,205
If you shriek it loud
enough and often enough,

534
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,665
they'll believe you.

535
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,501
Above all, use their free press

536
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,837
and their free speech to destroy them.

537
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:14,715
(speaking German)

538
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,718
'Lebensraum'
they demanded, living room.

539
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,514
Our lands are overcrowded.

540
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:23,599
(lighthearted music)

541
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,476
But at the same time they gave prizes

542
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,437
to mothers who bore the most sons.

543
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,273
(crowd cheering)

544
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,694
They brought together
large groups of young men

545
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,529
and young girls for human breeding.

546
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,034
Read what one of their leaders wrote.

547
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:59,176
(babies crying)

548
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,969
Of course, the children
from this assembly line

549
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,388
belonged to the State,

550
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,556
to be scientifically trained for conquest.

551
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,309
(babies crying)

552
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:24,243
Another howl was the lack of raw material.

553
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,082
They claimed they were the
have-nots and we were the haves.

554
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,126
But out of this supposed lack

555
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,545
they built up the greatest war machines

556
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,463
the world has ever known.

557
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,217
These are the published figures

558
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,511
from the German military budget.

559
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:49,810
Actually between 1933 and 1939,

560
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,146
Hitler's program of rearmament

561
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,440
cost more than $80 billion!

562
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:59,194
The Nazis alone assembled a striking force

563
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:04,283
of 30 panzer divisions,
70 motorized divisions,

564
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:10,581
140 infantry divisions,
plus the Luftwaffe,

565
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,000
the world's largest air force.

566
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,878
And they had no raw materials.

567
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:19,590
Think of the bread, the
automobiles, the good things of life

568
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,217
that the German, Italian, Japanese leaders

569
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,928
might have given their people
if they had spent this money

570
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,848
for peace instead of war.

571
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,850
You know what billions we are now spending

572
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,019
to match their military force.

573
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:36,190
No, no these arguments
were all smokescreens.

574
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:41,153
When war came, the democracies
proved to be the have-nots,

575
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,529
and our enemies the haves.

576
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:46,325
And when war came, where did it come?

577
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,161
(drumming music)

578
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,377
(thunder cracking)

579
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,296
Remember that date.

580
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:02,883
September 18th, 1931,

581
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:07,930
a date we should remember
as well as December 7, 1941.

582
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,891
For on that date in 1931,

583
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,936
the war we are now fighting began.

584
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:18,690
The place was Manchuria, the
northernmost province of China,

585
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:21,235
6,000 miles from San Francisco.

586
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:26,198
Manchuria, the first
objective in the Tanaka plan.

587
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,159
By September 18th the
Japanese, who by treaty

588
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,995
patrolled the Southern Manchurian Railway,

589
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:35,290
had secretly and illegally
increased their garrisons.

590
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,254
On the Korean-Manchurian border

591
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,799
an entire Japanese army was assembled,

592
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,052
conveniently equipped
for a winter campaign.

593
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:49,137
All they needed was an excuse.

594
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,139
They made their own.

595
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,227
At 10:30 that night, just
after The Mukden Express

596
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:58,313
had passed by, a section
of track was dynamited,

597
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:01,358
causing damage to one
rail and two fishplates.

598
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,239
Japan's honor had been violated.

599
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,575
(explosions booming)

600
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,952
Within half an hour, the
Japanese railroad garrison

601
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,788
launched a coordinated
attack on the barracks

602
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,040
of the sleeping Chinese Army at Mukden.

603
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,210
The slaughter was appalling.

604
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,296
(horses galloping)

605
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,508
By midnight, the conveniently
placed Japanese Army

606
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,803
poured across the Korean
border, and the first open act

607
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:32,848
of aggression, the invasion
of Manchuria, was on.

608
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,476
In four days they had occupied

609
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,896
the whole of southern Manchuria,

610
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:41,773
and shortly after, the whole country.

611
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:46,028
Manchuria became Manchukuo, a puppet state

612
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:50,157
with an obedient stooge on
the throne, Henry Pu Yi,

613
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,577
a weakling whom the Japanese
had prepared for the job

614
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,330
with seven years of women and song.

615
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,879
In Washington, Henry L. Stimson,
then Secretary of State,

616
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,424
now Secretary of War, sent
out a blistering denunciation

617
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,176
of the attack.

618
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,094
The League of Nations
sent a committee of five

619
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,304
headed by Lord Lytton

620
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,556
and including our own General Frank McCoy

621
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,308
to Manchuria to investigate.

622
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:21,438
In October of 1932, the
committee issued its report.

623
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,359
- We found that the Japanese occupation

624
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:29,154
of this large part of
China was not justified

625
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:33,075
on the ground of self defense,
and that the new state

626
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:37,120
which had been set up, was
a Japanese protectorate

627
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:41,375
rather than a genuine case of
Manchurian self-determination.

628
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,669
- [Narrator] Shortly after,
the League condemned Japan

629
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:44,962
as an aggressor nation.

630
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,508
(speaking French)

631
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,969
- [Translator] I call on His
Excellency, Mr. Matsuoka,

632
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,387
delegate of Japan.

633
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,473
(people chattering)

634
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,063
- It is a matter of common knowledge

635
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:08,110
that Japan's policy is
fundamentally inspired

636
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,823
by a genuine desire to guarantee peace

637
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,491
in the Far East

638
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,828
and to contribute to the maintenance

639
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,663
of peace throughout the world.

640
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:25,794
Japan, however, find it impossible

641
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:28,213
to accept the report

642
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,258
adopted by the assembly.

643
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,635
- [Narrator] In answer
the Japanese delegates,

644
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:37,264
knowing there were no guns
behind this condemnation,

645
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:41,143
smiled, took up their briefcases,

646
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,936
and marched out of the League.

647
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,397
Northern Manchuria was dead.

648
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,816
Collective security was dead.

649
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,694
The green light had been
given the aggressors.

650
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,030
We and the rest of the world
knew that these aggressors

651
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,157
should be stopped and punished,

652
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,493
but we were unwilling to
make the necessary sacrifices

653
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,495
to back up that opinion.

654
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,707
It was impossible to
convince a farm boy in Iowa,

655
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,876
or a driver of a London bus,

656
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,129
or a waiter in a Paris cafe,
that he should go to war

657
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,214
because of a mud hut in Manchuria.

658
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,301
(explosion booming)

659
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,263
Yet the subsequent course
of history makes it clear

660
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:21,433
that that incident, so many miles away,

661
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,226
is one of the main reasons that you

662
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,979
and millions of others
are in uniform today.

663
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,192
The Japs had Manchuria.

664
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,403
Phase number one of the
Tanaka plan was completed.

665
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:36,281
Phase number two, the conquest of China.

666
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,660
In 1932, without warning,
the Japs attacked

667
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,788
the Chinese city of Shanghai.

668
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:46,083
(explosions booming)

669
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,877
(plane engines humming)

670
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,674
(explosions booming)

671
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,594
(people shouting)

672
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:03,892
(bombs whistling)

673
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:07,062
(explosions booming)

674
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:13,693
(guns firing)

675
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:14,736
(bombs whistling)

676
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:16,655
(explosions booming)

677
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,406
(plane engines humming)

678
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,576
(explosions booming)

679
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,997
(bombs whistling )

680
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,167
(explosions booming)

681
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:39,052
(woman crying)

682
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:43,515
(explosions booming)

683
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:44,766
(plane engines humming)

684
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,853
(bombs whistling)

685
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:51,022
(explosions booming)

686
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,777
(woman crying)

687
00:44:55,986 --> 00:45:00,866
(guns firing)
(plane engines humming)

688
00:45:06,872 --> 00:45:09,416
(guns firing)

689
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:14,129
(explosions booming)

690
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:20,510
(plane engines humming)

691
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,315
Here they met such stubborn resistance,

692
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,026
they had to pour more than 75,000 troops

693
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,904
into the local battle
before capturing the city.

694
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,281
This resistance made them decide to shift

695
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,242
their campaign to the north, and in 1933,

696
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:47,037
they added the province
of Jehol to Manchuria.

697
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:51,791
Yes, the Japs launched the
second phase of the Tanaka plan.

698
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,919
But they had yet to finish it.

699
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,297
A united nation stands against them.

700
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:02,302
Under the inspired leadership
of General Chiang Kai-shek,

701
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,931
the Chinese people fought,
and still fight on.

702
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:12,646
Meantime, what of Japan's partners?

703
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,233
What helpless people were
they planning to bomb,

704
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,194
slaughter, drive into slavery?

705
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,614
Hitler was not yet
ready, but Mussolini was.

706
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,241
Mussolini had to be.

707
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,117
His people were growing restless.

708
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,162
Fascism hadn't produced
the heaven on Earth

709
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:30,497
that he had promised them.

710
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,458
So he pulled the old trick
of launching a foreign war

711
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,669
to divert attention from troubles at home.

712
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,422
So Mussolini beat his chest like Tarzan

713
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,591
and looked around for a worthy foe.

714
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,636
He found one, Ethiopia.

715
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,846
(drumming music)

716
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:50,225
A good country for the
beginning of a glorious empire.

717
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,018
Its army had no machine guns.

718
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:55,563
Its army had no tanks.

719
00:46:55,772 --> 00:47:00,360
Its army did have an air force,
exactly one old airplane,

720
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,822
one airplane against a
nation which had developed

721
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,782
a new theory of total air war,

722
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:11,329
of the blitz which would wipe
out cities, destroy civilians,

723
00:47:11,538 --> 00:47:12,747
man, woman, and child.

724
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:18,378
In October of 1935, following
the Japanese example,

725
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,089
an incident was provoked
at the little settlement

726
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:24,134
of Walwal near the border of Ethiopia

727
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,677
and Italian Somaliland.

728
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,180
Italy's honor had been violated.

729
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:32,726
Refusing any arbitration,
Mussolini moved the whole might

730
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:35,687
of his army through the
Suez Canal to overrun

731
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,105
the undefended country.

732
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,191
Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie

733
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,360
appeared before the League of Nations.

734
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:47,490
(speaking Amharic)

735
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:52,162
I must still fight on until
my tardy allies appear,

736
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,539
and if they never come, I say to you

737
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:57,834
without bitterness, the West will perish.

738
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,755
(people chattering)

739
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,800
Members of the League
half-heartedly stopped trading

740
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,219
with Italy, but refused the only thing

741
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:11,264
that will stop any aggressor, force.

742
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,436
Ethiopia was left to herself.

743
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,899
Native leaders came to
pledge their allegiance.

744
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:25,904
(speaking foreign dialects)

745
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:39,751
The people of Ethiopia, with
their spears and bare hands,

746
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,796
faced the guns and the
tanks of the invaders,

747
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,422
fighting desperately and gallantly

748
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,508
to save their country from conquest.

749
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:50,762
(explosions booming)

750
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:03,191
(plane engines humming)

751
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,027
(bombs whistling)

752
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:09,155
(explosions booming)

753
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,288
They fought and they died.

754
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:20,458
But in the end, there
could be but one result.

755
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:22,502
Might triumphed.

756
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,131
Italy conquered Ethiopia.

757
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:30,135
Many of our elected leaders
warned us of danger.

758
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:33,012
- Without a declaration of war

759
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:37,392
and without warning or
justification of any kind,

760
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:43,314
civilians, including vast
numbers of women and children,

761
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:49,070
are being ruthlessly murdered
with bombs from the air.

762
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,531
- [Narrator] But we were
still hypnotized by the fact

763
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,741
that two broad oceans stood between us

764
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,410
and the rest of the world.

765
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,037
We didn't realize that the
time when months were needed

766
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,498
to span these oceans was ended,

767
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:03,668
that the steam ship had
cut these months to days,

768
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,462
and that now the whole Earth's surface

769
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,505
could be covered in the space of hours.

770
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,551
Yes, we were a nation that wanted peace.

771
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,595
But we hadn't yet
learned that peace for us

772
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,513
depends on peace for all.

773
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,224
Nobody would run the risk of war

774
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:21,936
because of some mud huts and
barren plains in Ethiopia,

775
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,563
any more than we would run the risk

776
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,399
for some similar huts
and plains in Manchuria.

777
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,695
Correctly interpreting our
attitude, the aggressors

778
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:33,948
were all the surer that they
could get what they wanted.

779
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:37,410
Japan had started on
her march of conquest.

780
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,954
Italy had begun her new empire.

781
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:44,209
And now the third
gangster, what about him?

782
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:48,338
We take him up in our next
film, and show how he joined

783
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,215
his partners and put in his bid.

784
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:55,929
For this is what we are
fighting, freedom's oldest enemy,

785
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,890
the passion of the few to rule the many.

786
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,059
This isn't just a war.

787
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,060
This is a common man's
♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪

788
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:02,894

Our homes,

792
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,154
the jobs we want to go back to,

793
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:18,284
the books we read, the very food we eat,

794
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:21,996
the hopes we have for our
kids, the kids themselves.

795
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:24,874
They won't be ours anymore.

796
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:28,169
That's what's at stake.

797
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:30,964
It's us or them.

798
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:32,298
The chips are down.

799
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:35,677
Two worlds stand against each other.

800
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:38,346
One must die.

801
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:39,597
One must live.

802
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:43,184
