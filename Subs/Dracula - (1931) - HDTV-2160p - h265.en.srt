1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,781
"Near Bistritz,

2
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:20,722
"the road turns towards
the heart of the Carpathians,

3
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:24,592
"one of the most barren and
least known places in Europe.”

4
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,523
Allow me.

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,033
Thank you very much,

6
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:31,319
What was that, Sara?

7
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,197
"One of the most barren and
least known places in Europe."

8
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:38,048
Keep reading.

9
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:41,847
"Crumbling castles are scattered
among the rugged summits.

10
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:45,135
"They belong to
a remote era..."

11
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:47,921
Coachman, you should go
a little slower!

12
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:52,290
No! No! We must get to the inn
before nightfall.

13
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,371
Why?

14
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:57,709
Today is Walpurgisnacht,
a night of evil.

15
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,257
Nosferatu...

16
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:02,773
The dead come out
from their tombs

17
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,015
and suck the blood
of the living.

18
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,769
Nonsense!

19
00:01:08,854 --> 00:01:11,947
You would not laugh
if you lived here.

20
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:16,238
Tonight, all doors
will be locked

21
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:20,567
and we shall pray to the Virgin,

22
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:53,955
How was the trip?

23
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,435
Very good, thank you.

24
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,142
I'm glad to hear it.

25
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,574
Lad, don't take my luggage down.

26
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:10,321
I must continue
on to Borgo Pass.

27
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:22,747
I must warn you that
today is St. Walpurga's day,

28
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,875
which is considered
a bad omen around here.

29
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:27,468
And the coachman,
who is a good man,

30
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,176
wishes to know whether
you wouldn't mind

31
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,800
continuing the journey
after sunrise.

32
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,199
I'm very sorry, but at midnight,

33
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:38,685
a carriage will be waiting
for me at the Borgo Pass.

34
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,170
Whose carriage?

35
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,872
Count Dracula's.

36
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,960
From Dracula's castle?

37
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:49,822
Right. That is
my destination.

38
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,868
Look, he wants to
travel on to Borgo Pass tonight.

39
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,495
I beg you
to stay the night here.

40
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,865
But all of this
is mere superstition.

41
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:06,072
I mean, in a mountainous
area like this one,

42
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,859
I don't understand how...

43
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:12,573
Anyway, what I mean to say
is that I'm not afraid.

44
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,055
I told him already,
this is a business affair.

45
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,563
I must go there, really.

46
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,727
Wait.

47
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:22,483
Since you mean to leave,
put this on.

48
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,185
Put it on, for God's sake.

49
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,583
It will protect you.

50
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,937
Thanks.

51
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:30,372
You are very welcome,

52
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:35,630
Good night.

53
00:03:35,718 --> 00:03:38,145
Good night,
and I wish you a good journey.

54
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:39,425
Good night.

55
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,780
Good night and good luck.

56
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:51,184
Giddy-up!
Giddy-up!

57
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:59,504
Tell me,

58
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,900
do you really believe
there are vampires

59
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:05,893
who come out of their tombs
and roam about looking for blood?

60
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:07,588
I have seen the victims!

61
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,329
Nonsense!

62
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,682
Come, Sara.

63
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,581
Count Dracula's carriage?

64
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,455
I am Dracula.

65
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:53,781
You couldn't have appeared
at a better time.

66
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,499
I have no idea what happened
to the coachman and my luggage.

67
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,361
With all that, I thought
I had come to the wrong place.

68
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:04,613
The walls of my
castle are cracked

69
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:07,241
and there are
shadows everywhere.

70
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:11,501
But come in.
Make yourself at home.

71
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:36,032
Listen to them.

72
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:39,008
They are the
children of the night.

73
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:42,990
What beautiful music they make!

74
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,467
The eternal
struggle for survival.

75
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:24,468
Every living creature needs
blood to keep on living.

76
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:30,353
The spider weaves its web
to catch the unwary fly.

77
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:36,265
Blood is life,
Mr. Renfield.

78
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:14,497
I think you will find this part
of the castle more appealing.

79
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:16,811
I certainly do.

80
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:19,294
I thought you might be hungry.

81
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,312
You are very kind,
Count Dracula.

82
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:22,470
Sit down.

83
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:23,711
Thanks.

84
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,596
I trust no one
knows of your visit.

85
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:19,695
Absolutely no one,
just as you recommended.

86
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,461
I assume you burned
all our correspondence.

87
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:29,711
I followed all your
instructions to the letter.

88
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:33,467
Excellent,
Mr. Renfield. Excellent.

89
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,904
It was nothing.
Just a scratch.

90
00:15:22,025 --> 00:15:23,565
Won't you have some?

91
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,697
I never drink

92
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,393
wine.

93
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,938
And now, if you're
feeling refreshed...

94
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,807
I would like to talk about
the lease of Carfax Abbey.

95
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:48,022
But all the documents
are in my briefcase.

96
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:51,039
I took the liberty
of sending for your luggage.

97
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,008
Everything is in order.
You just need to sign it.

98
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,682
I hope there are enough
tags here for all your bags.

99
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,692
I am only taking three boxes.

100
00:16:57,664 --> 00:17:00,757
We shall leave tomorrow night.

101
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,916
Everything will be ready.

102
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,359
I hope you find it comfortable.

103
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,420
Thanks.
It looks appealing.

104
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:16,155
Now I shall leave you alone.

105
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:28,764
I may be occupied
during the day tomorrow.

106
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:34,339
In that case,
we shall meet here at dusk.

107
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:52,678
Good night, Mr. Renfield.

108
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:55,321
Look!

109
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,339
Fingers frozen
stiff on the helm.

110
00:19:59,386 --> 00:20:00,970
He must have died of fright.

111
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,214
What a terrible tragedy!

112
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,639
Not even a shred of
the sails is left.

113
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:13,576
It must have been
a terrible storm.

114
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:22,130
What about the sailors?
What became of them?

115
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:27,272
Master! Master!

116
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,059
We've arrived!

117
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:32,147
Can't you hear me,
Master? Master!

118
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:38,917
What's that?

119
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,543
It's coming from that hatchway.

120
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:05,497
It is believed to be due
to severe weather.

121
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:11,958
A madman is the sole survivor.

122
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:17,142
Maritime authorities will deliver
the cargo to its destinations.

123
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:12,169
You will tell Dr. Seward,
who is sitting in the next box,

124
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:14,215
that there is
a phone call for him.

125
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,820
Once you have given him
this message,

126
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:21,918
you will remember nothing.

127
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:39,483
Dr. Seward, there's
a phone call for you.

128
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,034
Excuse me.

129
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,725
Pardon me.

130
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:50,118
Yes?

131
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:53,221
I happened to
overhear your name.

132
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,968
Are you the Dr. Seward who
has a sanatorium in Whitby?

133
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,515
That's right.

134
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:59,674
I am Count Dracula.

135
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:02,073
I have just rented Carfax Abbey.

136
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,323
I understand it's next to the
gardens of your sanatorium,

137
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:07,106
Correct. It lies
next to my property.

138
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:09,579
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Count.

139
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:14,421
Would you like to join us?

140
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:23,198
Count,
allow me to introduce my daughter Eva.

141
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:28,653
Miss Weston.

142
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:35,968
Mr. Harker.

143
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:42,276
Count Dracula has just
rented Carfax Abbey.

144
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:46,883
It will be a joy to see those
dark windows lit up again.

145
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:51,364
Count, I beg you to excuse
me. There's a phone call for me.

146
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:57,090
In the meantime,
please be seated.

147
00:24:57,177 --> 00:24:58,644
My pleasure.

148
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,140
A very nice house could be
built out of those Carfax ruins.

149
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:14,112
Of course,
it would take a lot of money.

150
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,440
I shall barely touch them.

151
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:18,643
They remind me
of the crumbling walls

152
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:21,699
of my own castle
in Transylvania.

153
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:25,955
What they remind me of
is that old toast.

154
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,869
"Lofty beams upon deserted walls

155
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:33,851
"beat with the echo
of our laughter

156
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:37,793
"as if the dead
whispered through them."

157
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,459
How nice!

158
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:41,662
Wait.

159
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:44,755
The next part's even nicer.

160
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:48,158
"For those who are already dead,
let us empty our glasses

161
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:52,806
"and let us cheer for him
among us who must die first."

162
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,749
You can keep the rest to yourself,
Lucia.

163
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,296
To really die...

164
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,894
To be really dead

165
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:03,480
must be sublime.

166
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:05,653
But, Count...

167
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:08,203
Something worse than death

168
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:12,184
awaits the living.

169
00:26:28,482 --> 00:26:30,329
Laugh all you like.

170
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:33,193
I find him fascinating.

171
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,681
Lucia the romantic.
That explains it.

172
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:40,473
That part about
crumbling walls...

173
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:45,154
I prefer someone
a little more normal.

174
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:46,656
Like Juan?

175
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,246
Yes, my dear.

176
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:50,374
Like Juan.

177
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:03,680
Well, Countess, I'm very tired.

178
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:20,787
I leave you with your count
and his crumbling abbey.

179
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:29,067
May you have sweet dreams.

180
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,461
Good night.

181
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:45,463
The fog is getting thicker.

182
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:47,011
Yes.

183
00:29:24,518 --> 00:29:26,290
Another death.

184
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:32,323
When was the last transfusion
performed on Miss Weston?

185
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:36,427
About four hours
before her death.

186
00:29:38,524 --> 00:29:42,313
Identical symptoms in each case.

187
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:46,174
A baffling loss of blood

188
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:48,966
that we've been
unable to prevent.

189
00:29:51,677 --> 00:29:53,450
Give me the magnifying glass.

190
00:30:03,206 --> 00:30:06,299
And these same two
marks were found

191
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,853
on each victim's neck.

192
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:28,116
,

193
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,747
we're dealing
here with vampires.

194
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,909
Vampires?

195
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,077
Nosferatu?

196
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,092
Yes, the vampire
of Transylvania.

197
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:41,190
That's right.
Nosferatu the vampire.

198
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:45,604
The vampire attacks
his victim's neck

199
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:48,540
and leaves two tiny white wounds

200
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,016
with a red dot in the center.

201
00:30:51,103 --> 00:30:55,705
But, Professor Van Helsing,
that theory is implausible.

202
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:58,452
Medical science nowadays
does not accept

203
00:30:58,532 --> 00:31:01,392
the existence of
such a creature.

204
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:03,710
That's just a myth.

205
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,645
A superstition.

206
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:10,980
Dr. Seward's patient,
Renfield,

207
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:14,117
whose blood I have
just analyzed,

208
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,409
is obsessed with the idea that
he must eat other living creatures

209
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:21,430
in order to
sustain his own life.

210
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:25,841
I am going to England with
Dr. Seward to study Renfield's case.

211
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:28,932
And perhaps I will prove to you

212
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,261
that the superstition
of yesterday

213
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,897
can become the
scientific reality of today.

214
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,411
Look.

215
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,898
No, don't take it away,
Martin! Don't take it away!

216
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:16,990
You're a good man. Don't!

217
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:26,501
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

218
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,528
Now you're interested
in spiders. Spiders!

219
00:32:30,612 --> 00:32:33,356
You're no longer
happy with flies.

220
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:35,329
Flies?

221
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:39,114
Tiny wretched flies!

222
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:41,206
Who could be happy with them?

223
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,150
You! A raving lunatic!

224
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:48,400
When nice plump spiders
aren't available,

225
00:32:48,486 --> 00:32:49,911
perhaps.

226
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:54,203
All right, do as you please.

227
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,992
But now come with me.

228
00:32:57,037 --> 00:33:00,857
The professor wants to speak
with you again. Let's go!

229
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:03,534
It's a very strange case.

230
00:33:03,613 --> 00:33:08,289
Nevertheless, the only thing
Renfield has craved so far

231
00:33:08,373 --> 00:33:10,569
are small bugs.

232
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,282
Not human beings.

233
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,997
That's what we think, Doctor

234
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,244
But you say that he
slips away from his room.

235
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:23,071
That he's gone for hours.

236
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:24,767
Where does he go?

237
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:27,049
Come in.

238
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:39,553
Well, Mr. Renfield.

239
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:46,513
You look much better now
than when I arrived this morning.

240
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:50,112
Thank you, Professor.
I feel much better.

241
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,388
Martin.

242
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:05,124
They tell me you studied
at Oxford University.

243
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:06,441
That's correct.

244
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:10,575
I graduated from the
school of law in 1927.

245
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:14,409
I was accepted by
the bar in 1928.

246
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:15,758
After that...

247
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:26,792
Excuse me.

248
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,428
An inferior organism.

249
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,977
Unworthy of my attention.

250
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:35,616
What would you have
done with that fly

251
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,938
had we not been here?

252
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:40,027
He'd have gobbled it up.

253
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,852
Tell me,
Mr. Renfield,

254
00:35:48,932 --> 00:35:52,141
what makes you eat flies?

255
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,665
The wings of flies, sir,

256
00:35:57,753 --> 00:36:02,503
represent the aerial power
of the psychic faculties.

257
00:36:03,634 --> 00:36:07,655
There's more to this
fellow than meets the eye, Doc

258
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,651
I've never seen
you like this, Eva.

259
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:23,943
What's wrong? Are you
worried about something?

260
00:36:24,023 --> 00:36:26,261
Have I done something
to hurt you?

261
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:32,957
You haven't done anything,
Juan. Don't worry.

262
00:36:33,038 --> 00:36:35,782
But there is
something wrong. Tell me,

263
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:40,649
I don't know what it could be.

264
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:44,674
I've been feeling
frightened lately.

265
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,322
When night begins to fall,

266
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,995
I get this feeling,

267
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,826
as if something were
tightening around me.

268
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:58,833
Oh, Juan.

269
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,175
Get your filthy hands off me!

270
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:03,985
Come on, Renfield.

271
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,504
You must let me out of here!

272
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:15,212
Why is it so important to you?

273
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,111
I scream at night.

274
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:21,054
I might bother Miss Eva

275
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:22,908
and even cause her nightmares.

276
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:24,807
Nightmares?

277
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:27,972
Yes, Doctor.
Yes.

278
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,452
Nightmares.

279
00:38:45,393 --> 00:38:46,506
It sounds like a wolf howling.

280
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:47,627
Yes, it does.

281
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:50,489
But I hardly think there
are wolves so near London.

282
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,393
He thinks there are

283
00:38:52,472 --> 00:38:54,868
and I've heard howling at night.

284
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,261
He says they're talking to him

285
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:59,934
and he screams back
at the top of his voice.

286
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:02,139
He's crazy.

287
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:04,650
I should have known.

288
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:32,123
You know very well
why the wolves talk.

289
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:34,634
Isn't that true,
Mr. Renfield?

290
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:39,432
And you also know
how to make them stop.

291
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,497
You know too much
to go on living!

292
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:55,527
We won't get another word
out of him for the time being.

293
00:39:57,006 --> 00:39:58,969
You can take him away, Martin.

294
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:04,003
Get up, flycatcher.

295
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,342
I'm warning you
once more, Doctor.

296
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:18,979
If you don't let me go,
you'll be responsible

297
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:21,255
for whatever happens
to your daughter.

298
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,296
What is that herb
that made him so upset?

299
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:42,923
Wolfsbane.

300
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:48,337
Peasants in Central Europe
use it to drive vampires away.

301
00:40:49,468 --> 00:40:53,837
Renfield reacted
as soon as he smelled it.

302
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,300
Yes.

303
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:04,745
He must be watched
closely day and night.

304
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,907
Especially at night.

305
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:08,648
Yes.

306
00:41:08,735 --> 00:41:11,744
You were saying
you had gone to bed.

307
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:15,736
Yes. I was reading
and I fell asleep.

308
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,914
I began to dream.
A dog barked.

309
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:24,240
And it looked as if the
whole room filled up with mist.

310
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:29,540
It was so thick

311
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:33,681
that I could hardly see
the light by my bedside.

312
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:38,756
It looked like a tiny
spark lost amidst the fog.

313
00:41:43,323 --> 00:41:46,025
I saw two red eyes staring at me

314
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:49,781
and a livid, white face
through the fog.

315
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:53,915
He came closer and closer.

316
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:56,081
I could feel his
breath on my face.

317
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:58,987
And his lips... Ah!

318
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:09,042
But, Eva, it was just a dream,

319
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,533
The next morning,

320
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:17,902
I felt very weak,
as if all life had been drained out of me.

321
00:42:17,989 --> 00:42:21,271
When did you have
this dream, Miss Eva?

322
00:42:25,224 --> 00:42:27,272
The night

323
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:30,212
that Father left
for Switzerland.

324
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:33,191
In other words,

325
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:37,831
the night after
Lucia was buried.

326
00:42:37,914 --> 00:42:41,470
Let's see.
Think for a moment.

327
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,556
Do you remember anything

328
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,733
that might have caused
this nightmare?

329
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:50,520
Nothing.

330
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:53,306
There's something
troubling Eva, Doctor.

331
00:42:53,389 --> 00:42:56,366
Something she doesn't
want to tell us.

332
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:01,005
And the face
you saw in your dream,

333
00:43:01,088 --> 00:43:05,458
you say it came
closer and closer?

334
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:09,555
That the lips touched you?

335
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:11,686
Where?

336
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:18,227
Eva.

337
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,619
No, Father.
Please!

338
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,141
What do you have on your neck?

339
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,959
Please, Father.

340
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,061
How long have you had
those marks on your neck?

341
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:24,805
Marks?

342
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:29,800
Since the day after that dream.

343
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,770
Count Dracula is here.

344
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:46,703
It's a pleasure
to see you again, Doctor.

345
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:49,489
I was sure you were back.

346
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,450
Miss Seward.

347
00:44:57,968 --> 00:45:01,440
Excuse me, Count Dracula.
This is Professor Van Helsing.

348
00:45:02,921 --> 00:45:07,174
Van Helsing,
the distinguished man of science

349
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:10,926
whose fame is known even in
the mountains of Transylvania.

350
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,989
Doctor, I beg you to excuse me,

351
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:18,931
but your daughter had better
go to her room immediately.

352
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,994
Aren't you feeling well?

353
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:26,012
I hope it's nothing serious.

354
00:45:26,095 --> 00:45:29,188
I had a terrible dream
a few nights ago

355
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,244
and I haven't been able
to get it out of my mind.

356
00:45:36,928 --> 00:45:40,400
Could it be you've taken
my stories too seriously?

357
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:41,870
Stories?

358
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:49,422
I made a humble effort
to entertain your fiancée

359
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:52,395
by telling her
a few of the legends,

360
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:55,721
somewhat gloomy ones,
about my distant motherland.

361
00:45:55,808 --> 00:46:00,874
Daughter,
I'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you.

362
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:03,350
You must go your room

363
00:46:03,431 --> 00:46:05,827
as Professor Van Helsing
has advised you to do.

364
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:10,308
But, Father, I tell you
I'm feeling fine now.

365
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,783
You'd better do as
your father says.

366
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:21,371
Very well, then.

367
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:29,232
Good night, my dear daughter.

368
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:39,520
I must go, Doctor.

369
00:46:44,286 --> 00:46:46,682
Professor Van Helsing,

370
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:50,740
I hope I shall have the
pleasure of seeing you again.

371
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,999
Good night.

372
00:46:56,628 --> 00:46:58,559
Good night, Juan.

373
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:01,145
Mr. Harker.,

374
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:15,234
I shall come by later
to enquire how you're feeling.

375
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:18,786
Thank you.

376
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:20,415
Good night, Miss Seward.

377
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,078
Good night.

378
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:04,982
I'm very sorry that
my visit was so untimely.

379
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:06,262
Not at all.

380
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,619
On the contrary,

381
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,475
it may turn out to be
of great importance.

382
00:48:10,562 --> 00:48:15,196
Moreover, before you leave,
you could be helpful to us.

383
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:19,420
It will be a pleasure
to do whatever I can.

384
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:30,749
Just a moment ago,
I discovered an amazing phenomenon.

385
00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:35,669
Something so incredible
that I do not trust my own eyes

386
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:39,105
and I'd like you
to help me prove it.

387
00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:44,413
Look.

388
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:17,024
Dr. Seward,
please accept my apologies.

389
00:49:18,036 --> 00:49:19,767
I couldn't help it.

390
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:34,244
Considering that
you have not yet lived

391
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:37,142
even one entire lifetime,

392
00:49:37,226 --> 00:49:40,319
you are a wise man, Professor

393
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,005
Did you see the
expression on his face?

394
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:01,787
He looked like an enraged beast.

395
00:50:07,094 --> 00:50:09,025
Dracula is our vampire,

396
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:10,487
Vampire?

397
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:12,538
For God's sake, Professor!

398
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:16,098
Vampires cast no
reflection in a mirror.

399
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:19,236
That is why Dracula
shattered that mirror.

400
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:23,182
Look, Professor,
this makes no sense whatsoever,

401
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:27,013
Dracula is the monster
who killed Lucia Weston.

402
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:30,305
The same one who left those
marks on Miss Eva's neck.

403
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:32,157
Him?

404
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:34,944
Well, please understand
that I mean no offense

405
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:39,661
but that's more like something
one of the patients here might say.

406
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:44,380
Yes! And that's exactly what
physicians in this country

407
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,430
and the police will think.

408
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,945
What gives vampires their power

409
00:50:49,032 --> 00:50:52,156
is the fact that people refuse
to believe in them.

410
00:51:22,692 --> 00:51:25,585
But, Professor,
according to your own theory,

411
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:29,649
the vampire must return
to his grave before dawn.

412
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:32,478
He must return to
his native land,

413
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:34,489
which is where he was buried.

414
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:39,087
Now, Count Dracula's
native land is Transylvania.

415
00:51:39,173 --> 00:51:42,297
Then he must have brought
some of his native soil with him.

416
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:46,174
Perhaps in boxes big enough
to serve as his bed.

417
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:03,386
Come on, come on.

418
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:07,607
Come on.

419
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:12,130
Renfield, what were
you doing out there?

420
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:18,049
Come on.
Come with me.

421
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:29,653
Renfield, did you hear
what we were saying?

422
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:36,508
Pay attention to
what he's telling you.

423
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:39,565
That is your only salvation.

424
00:52:41,966 --> 00:52:45,638
And the same is true for her.

425
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:56,813
Save me!
Save my soul!

426
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:00,839
Save me!
Save me!

427
00:53:03,322 --> 00:53:06,562
I am weak.
You are strong.

428
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,439
I am crazy.
You are sane.

429
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,856
I shall save you.

430
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,339
But you must tell us
everything you know.

431
00:53:20,384 --> 00:53:21,967
Everything.

432
00:53:27,154 --> 00:53:30,131
Fool! Fool!

433
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:33,955
And I thought
you were a wise man.

434
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:39,836
What do I stand to gain
by telling you everything?

435
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:45,568
That physician keeps me
locked up here all day.

436
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:50,211
And when I behave nicely,
he gives me a bit of sugar

437
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:52,373
so that I can catch flies.

438
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:57,559
But if I serve the Master...

439
00:53:59,808 --> 00:54:03,829
An intelligent madman
would rather serve

440
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:06,383
the one who can grant him life.

441
00:54:06,463 --> 00:54:10,484
Him? Who are you
talking about?

442
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:17,364
Why mention names
among friends, Professor?

443
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,994
What ties do you
have with Dracula?

444
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,562
Dracula?

445
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:29,744
I've never even heard
that name before.

446
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:31,678
You're lying!

447
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:36,247
Crazy people, Professor,

448
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:39,308
do not have the ability
to distinguish

449
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:42,286
between what is true and false.

450
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:46,387
For that reason,
I take no offense.

451
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,302
I begged you to let me out

452
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:01,553
but you wouldn't do it.

453
00:55:01,633 --> 00:55:05,570
Now it's too late.
It has already happened.

454
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:07,202
What has happened?

455
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,315
I dare not say it.
I dare not.

456
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:16,097
I would die in
torment if I tried.

457
00:55:16,181 --> 00:55:18,302
And you shall die in torment

458
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:21,665
if you let innocent blood
stain your soul.

459
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:22,945
No!

460
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:29,717
God will not condemn
the soul of a poor madman.

461
00:55:29,799 --> 00:55:33,356
He knows very well
that the power of evil

462
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:37,763
is too great for those
of us with weak minds

463
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:40,706
to resist.

464
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:46,430
Then, Renfield, trust me.

465
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:50,302
Tell me what I want to know.

466
00:55:51,387 --> 00:55:53,087
What do you want to know?

467
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:57,456
The name of the creature
that has deranged your mind.

468
00:55:57,577 --> 00:56:01,165
The one you call "Master."

469
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,442
No!

470
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,937
Don't ask me that!

471
00:56:07,637 --> 00:56:09,368
Don't ask me that!

472
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:12,122
No! Don't ask me that!

473
00:56:13,866 --> 00:56:15,682
You must tell us!

474
00:56:15,723 --> 00:56:17,222
!

475
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:18,927
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

476
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:23,722
Renfield, tell us
before it's too late.

477
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,660
OW Before your soul
is damned forever.

478
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:29,025
I shall tell you.

479
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:34,445
Master! Master!

480
00:56:35,647 --> 00:56:37,811
I wasn't going
to tell them anything!

481
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:39,971
I haven't told them anything!

482
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:43,460
I'm faithful to you, Master!

483
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:49,725
Dr. Seward!
Dr. Seward!

484
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:54,406
Miss Eva...
Over there... Dead!

485
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:56,737
Thank God, she's still alive.

486
00:57:58,055 --> 00:58:01,527
She's alive,
but she's at great risk.

487
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:05,013
She's under his influence.

488
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,496
That would be terrible.

489
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,361
I can't believe it.

490
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:16,582
Nevertheless, it's true.

491
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,718
We must put an end to it.

492
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:24,509
We must confront it.

493
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,597
Is Dr. Seward around?

494
00:58:39,647 --> 00:58:41,609
No. What do you need?

495
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:44,898
That flycatcher
has escaped again

496
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:47,567
and he could try
something foolish.

497
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:50,821
Dr. Seward and his famous
scholar are in the abbey

498
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:53,217
chasing vampires.

499
00:58:53,304 --> 00:58:55,773
Vampires. Flycatchers.

500
00:58:57,095 --> 00:58:58,942
Look, Mr. Harker,

501
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:03,276
if there's a brave man
after my job, he can have it.

502
00:59:03,324 --> 00:59:05,287
I'm going to look for work
at another asylum

503
00:59:05,336 --> 00:59:08,386
where the crazy people
are nice and reasonable.

504
00:59:08,469 --> 00:59:10,865
Let them think they're
Napoleon or royalty.

505
00:59:10,907 --> 00:59:12,722
Something worthy of my time.

506
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,917
"The mysterious lady in white,

507
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:37,322
“that merciless scourge
of childhood,

508
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:40,029
“played another of her tricks
last night

509
00:59:40,117 --> 00:59:42,049
"a little after nightfall.

510
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:46,611
"The testimony
given by two girls,

511
00:59:51,105 --> 00:59:56,826
"both confirm it's a beautiful
lady dressed in white

512
00:59:56,908 --> 01:00:01,467
"whose modus operandi
is to offer

513
01:00:01,512 --> 01:00:04,562
"candy to her victim.

514
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:08,742
"She then lures the victim
to a deserted corner

515
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:12,613
"where she delicately bites
the victim's neck."

516
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:27,466
What would she know
about the lady in white?

517
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:29,210
Why would she know
anything about it?

518
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,061
She shouldn't have read that.

519
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:32,960
For God's sake,
Mr. Harker!

520
01:00:35,907 --> 01:00:39,843
When did you see Lucia
again after she was buried?

521
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,679
Once when I was on the terrace.

522
01:00:46,546 --> 01:00:48,246
She came out of the shadows.

523
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:52,688
She came towards me.

524
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,667
She stopped and stared at me.

525
01:00:55,793 --> 01:00:57,682
I began to speak to her.

526
01:00:59,507 --> 01:01:01,122
And then

527
01:01:03,144 --> 01:01:05,107
I remembered

528
01:01:06,858 --> 01:01:08,631
that she was dead.

529
01:01:14,596 --> 01:01:19,620
Her face took on
a horrible expression

530
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,879
like that of a hungry beast.

531
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:27,124
Like a wolf,

532
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:31,229
She turned

533
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:36,062
and disappeared
into the fog again.

534
01:01:38,854 --> 01:01:43,604
So the lady dressed
in white was...

535
01:01:46,901 --> 01:01:48,791
Lucia.

536
01:01:56,689 --> 01:02:00,785
Miss, I promise you
that from this day on,

537
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:02,413
Lucia will rest in peace.

538
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:06,355
Her soul will be forever freed

539
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:08,522
of that awful appetite.

540
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:12,589
Since you can save
Lucia's soul after her death,

541
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:15,683
promise me you'll save mine too.

542
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:19,432
You're not going to die,
my love. You will go on living.

543
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:22,915
No, Juan, you mustn't touch me.

544
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:25,735
And you mustn't
kiss me ever again.

545
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:28,636
What are you saying?

546
01:02:28,724 --> 01:02:31,964
Professor, explain it to him,

547
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,592
Tell him,

548
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:35,221
I can't.

549
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:49,383
Eva.

550
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:58,195
Juan, it's over between us.

551
01:02:58,244 --> 01:03:01,294
Our love, our wedding plans.

552
01:03:05,169 --> 01:03:08,757
Please, Juan,
don't look at me like that.

553
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:11,666
I love you.

554
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,829
I love you more
than life itself.

555
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:18,623
But this terrible thing...

556
01:03:18,671 --> 01:03:21,447
He wants it to be this way

557
01:03:21,573 --> 01:03:24,972
and I must obey.

558
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,182
You know what you're doing?

559
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:37,352
You're driving her crazy.

560
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:44,975
Mr. Harker, you should be
worried about what's out there.

561
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:49,964
The last rays of
the sun are gone.

562
01:03:50,049 --> 01:03:53,331
Night hovers over us again.

563
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:11,712
We've put wolfsbane in this
room and in your bedroom

564
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:15,232
to free you from Dracula,
in case he comes back.

565
01:04:15,273 --> 01:04:17,120
,
all right,

566
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:18,939
because either
she returns with me

567
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:20,796
to London or I call the police.

568
01:04:20,883 --> 01:04:24,092
Seward, my friend,
I must be in charge here

569
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:26,641
or whatever I do
will be useless.

570
01:04:40,886 --> 01:04:45,793
Miss Eva must keep this
branch of wolfsbane in her bed.

571
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:49,001
Be careful that she doesn't
drop it while she sleeps.

572
01:04:54,621 --> 01:04:56,320
Under no circumstances

573
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,479
must those windows
be opened during the night.

574
01:04:59,456 --> 01:05:01,113
I understand, Professor.

575
01:05:03,016 --> 01:05:05,560
Come, my daughter.

576
01:05:57,645 --> 01:06:00,885
Yes, Master.

577
01:06:14,823 --> 01:06:17,873
You've come back, Master

578
01:06:23,257 --> 01:06:25,801
Are you angry with me?

579
01:06:34,516 --> 01:06:37,218
No, Master!

580
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:39,001
Please!

581
01:06:39,932 --> 01:06:41,547
Not her!

582
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,907
Never again!

583
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:47,311
No, Master!

584
01:06:47,399 --> 01:06:49,943
No! Not her!

585
01:06:51,616 --> 01:06:52,544
No!

586
01:06:54,247 --> 01:06:55,904
No! No!

587
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:57,529
No! No!

588
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,684
Please!

589
01:07:03,764 --> 01:07:06,773
No, Master, please!

590
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,481
Mr. Harker,

591
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,728
though I have devoted my life to

592
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:20,010
the study of
the strangest things,

593
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:22,519
little known
facts that the world

594
01:07:22,684 --> 01:07:25,111
is perhaps better
off not knowing,

595
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:29,800
a world content to busy itself
instead with mundane affairs.

596
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,584
Dracula's name is
associated with a legend

597
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:37,418
still told among
his fellow countrymen.

598
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:40,320
The legend tells
of an ancient family

599
01:07:40,403 --> 01:07:42,524
that disappeared
over five centuries ago

600
01:07:42,608 --> 01:07:45,848
and was said
to be made up of vampires.

601
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:48,828
Since I discovered, by chance,

602
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:51,775
that Dracula cast
no reflection in the mirror

603
01:07:51,855 --> 01:07:53,396
and that in addition,

604
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,688
that three large boxes had
been sent to Carfax Abbey,

605
01:07:56,769 --> 01:07:58,003
and since I also knew that

606
01:07:58,084 --> 01:07:59,815
a vampire must sleep
during the day

607
01:07:59,902 --> 01:08:01,327
in his native earth,

608
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:06,013
I quickly realized that
Dracula had to be the person

609
01:08:06,092 --> 01:08:08,098
whom Renfield
calls "Master."

610
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:11,116
One of the undead
who has been able

611
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,482
to prolong his life
beyond its natural limits

612
01:08:14,565 --> 01:08:19,008
by feeding on the blood
of other living creatures.

613
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:23,772
The only way we can save Eva

614
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,626
is by finding the place

615
01:08:26,714 --> 01:08:28,835
where the living corpse
of the vampire rests

616
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:32,708
and driving a stake
through its heart.

617
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,479
What a strange conversation

618
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:03,733
for men who are not crazy!

619
01:09:03,816 --> 01:09:07,679
Renfield, you I will force me
to put you in a straitjacket.

620
01:09:09,156 --> 01:09:13,715
I'm afraid that would be
of no use at this point.

621
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:43,621
What? What's
that, Doctor?

622
01:09:43,705 --> 01:09:45,435
Again?

623
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:47,455
I'm on my way, sir.

624
01:09:47,536 --> 01:09:49,267
Right away, Doctor.

625
01:09:52,294 --> 01:09:55,650
The doctor's favorite
lunatic is at large again.

626
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:06,333
Well, I'll be! That madman
must be Hercules himself.

627
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,956
What's he done now?

628
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:09,658
Come and see for yourself,

629
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,899
From now on

630
01:10:24,986 --> 01:10:28,501
any mental suggestion
you receive from me

631
01:10:28,584 --> 01:10:30,938
must be carried out.

632
01:10:31,911 --> 01:10:36,080
Whenever I want you
to do something,

633
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:38,099
it must be done.

634
01:10:39,147 --> 01:10:41,152
It must be done.

635
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:43,663
When you come out of this state,

636
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:46,917
you will remember nothing
of what I am telling you now.

637
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,963
Do you understand?

638
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:51,098
I understand.

639
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:54,387
I have already told you
what you must do.

640
01:10:54,467 --> 01:10:55,733
Now,

641
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,179
obey.

642
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:52,882
Renfield, you know
where those boxes are.

643
01:11:52,965 --> 01:11:55,973
Tell us and we
shall protect you.

644
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:59,385
But I no longer need
your protection.

645
01:11:59,465 --> 01:12:03,170
The Master is not angry with

646
01:12:03,256 --> 01:12:05,493
On the contrary, he's pleased.

647
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:08,470
He came to my window

648
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:12,958
in the moonlight
and promised me things.

649
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:16,908
Not to say them, but to do them.

650
01:12:16,991 --> 01:12:17,951
Do them?

651
01:12:18,113 --> 01:12:19,073
Yes!

652
01:12:19,158 --> 01:12:22,324
To make them happen.

653
01:12:22,407 --> 01:12:26,661
Ed mist spread over the lawn

654
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:29,717
and came towards me
like a raging fire.

655
01:12:29,797 --> 01:12:32,921
Then the Master parted the mist

656
01:12:33,008 --> 01:12:36,871
and revealed before my eyes
thousands of rats,

657
01:12:36,954 --> 01:12:41,356
their eyes inflamed like his own,
but smaller.

658
01:12:41,443 --> 01:12:45,305
He raised his hand
and they all stopped.

659
01:12:45,389 --> 01:12:47,394
I felt he was telling me,

660
01:12:48,175 --> 01:12:52,196
"Rats! Rats! Rats!

661
01:12:52,276 --> 01:12:55,368
"Thousands, millions of rats!

662
01:12:55,448 --> 01:12:57,263
"And in each one of them,

663
01:12:57,344 --> 01:13:01,016
"a life full of red blood

664
01:13:01,096 --> 01:13:04,262
"promising many years of life.

665
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,352
"I shall give you
all those beings!

666
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:09,179
"Yes! And many more!

667
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:13,587
"For countless generations!

668
01:13:13,671 --> 01:13:15,792
"But you must obey.”

669
01:13:15,876 --> 01:13:17,881
What did he want you to do?

670
01:13:17,965 --> 01:13:20,202
What has already been done.

671
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:24,729
Dracula is in this house!

672
01:13:24,813 --> 01:13:27,441
Where else did you
expect him to be?

673
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:30,688
He won't be able
to cause any harm.

674
01:13:30,771 --> 01:13:32,703
We've placed wolfsbane
in every room.

675
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,601
So here you are!

676
01:13:35,685 --> 01:13:39,474
For God's sake! This man
is going to drive me crazy.

677
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:42,646
He broke through those iron bars

678
01:13:42,726 --> 01:13:45,122
as if they were toothpicks.

679
01:13:45,202 --> 01:13:46,933
Come with me, Martin.

680
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,925
Let me show you somewhere
he'll never escape from.

681
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:52,240
Let's go.

682
01:13:52,321 --> 01:13:57,460
You may be right,
but I still say what St. Thomas said.

683
01:14:07,216 --> 01:14:08,684
Van Helsing.

684
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:18,666
Now that you've learned
what you've learned,

685
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:23,073
it would be wise
to return to your country.

686
01:14:23,156 --> 01:14:24,084
Ha!

687
01:14:24,974 --> 01:14:28,183
I intend to stay
and protect those

688
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,123
you seek to destroy.

689
01:14:36,852 --> 01:14:39,132
You're too late.

690
01:14:39,212 --> 01:14:43,887
Dracula's blood is already
flowing in Miss Seward's veins.

691
01:14:43,971 --> 01:14:47,601
She will live for all eternity

692
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:50,197
as I myself have.

693
01:14:53,566 --> 01:14:57,197
Should you escape, Dracula,

694
01:14:58,441 --> 01:15:03,390
we know how to save
Miss Eva's soul,

695
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:05,549
if not her life.

696
01:15:06,758 --> 01:15:08,764
Of course I'm all right.

697
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:12,826
I've never felt better
in my whole life.

698
01:15:30,282 --> 01:15:34,071
Tell me, why are you staring
at me like that?

699
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:38,210
You're so...

700
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,137
I can hardly believe it!

701
01:15:40,225 --> 01:15:42,272
You look like a different woman.

702
01:15:45,602 --> 01:15:48,652
Darling, you look terrific!

703
01:15:49,742 --> 01:15:51,589
And I feel terrific.

704
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,402
But it's stuffy in here.

705
01:15:59,453 --> 01:16:01,416
And that smell.

706
01:16:01,503 --> 01:16:06,062
It's the wreath of flowers
the professor wanted me to...

707
01:16:08,236 --> 01:16:09,703
Marta!

708
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,183
Yes, miss?

709
01:16:15,044 --> 01:16:18,137
Throw away those awful flowers,
will you?

710
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:21,457
And please open the windows
and let some fresh air in.

711
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:26,719
The professor won't approve.

712
01:16:26,807 --> 01:16:28,306
Don't worry about him.

713
01:17:09,828 --> 01:17:11,991
It's much nicer out here.

714
01:17:15,013 --> 01:17:16,712
I'm happy to see you like this.

715
01:17:16,793 --> 01:17:19,104
I was really worried about you.

716
01:17:20,623 --> 01:17:22,122
I don't know

717
01:17:23,099 --> 01:17:25,294
what was wrong with me.

718
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:28,583
It's as if

719
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:32,026
I'm waking from a nightmare.

720
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:53,228
Juan, the moonlight
is beautiful, isn't it?

721
01:17:54,243 --> 01:17:59,035
Look. Have you ever
seen so many stars?

722
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:01,588
Millions and millions.

723
01:18:02,484 --> 01:18:05,228
And they seem to be so close,

724
01:18:05,308 --> 01:18:09,794
as if you could reach out
and touch them.

725
01:18:12,582 --> 01:18:15,748
Would you like me to
offer you a handful of them?

726
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:25,308
Do not forget, Van Helsing,
that over the years

727
01:18:25,388 --> 01:18:27,975
those who crossed my path

728
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:30,486
paid for it with their lives

729
01:18:31,578 --> 01:18:36,138
and some in very
unpleasant ways.

730
01:18:46,474 --> 01:18:47,551
Come

731
01:18:49,878 --> 01:18:51,028
here!

732
01:18:51,812 --> 01:18:52,931
Stop!

733
01:18:54,289 --> 01:18:59,313
You shall not move your hand
unless I tell you to.

734
01:19:18,973 --> 01:19:23,374
Take out whatever you have
in there and put it in this box.

735
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,711
Hurry up!

736
01:19:43,927 --> 01:19:45,278
Did you obey?

737
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:46,779
Yes.

738
01:20:06,947 --> 01:20:07,912
Yes, that's what you said.

739
01:20:07,952 --> 01:20:08,880
No, I didn't, Juan.

740
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,345
What do you mean?

741
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:13,057
I could have never told you
such a foolish thing.

742
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:14,371
You made it up.

743
01:20:14,452 --> 01:20:17,228
No,
you told me that the night frightened you.

744
01:20:17,316 --> 01:20:19,902
And what is there about
the night to frighten me?

745
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:21,716
I love the night.

746
01:20:21,803 --> 01:20:25,666
It's the only time
when I feel truly alive.

747
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:30,077
Careful, a bat! It could get
tangled in your hair.

748
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:37,346
Yes, I will.

749
01:20:39,407 --> 01:20:41,106
I will.

750
01:20:42,502 --> 01:20:43,884
You'll what?

751
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,790
Me? I didn't
say anything.

752
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,582
I thought you did.

753
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:59,248
God, that bat was huge.

754
01:21:00,454 --> 01:21:01,382
Juan,

755
01:21:01,808 --> 01:21:04,932
I want you to promise
me something.

756
01:21:05,019 --> 01:21:08,259
Whatever you want,
my love. Whatever you ask.

757
01:21:11,481 --> 01:21:14,805
That strange professor
and his herbs...

758
01:21:14,885 --> 01:21:16,616
I can't stand them any longer.

759
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,566
Will you do me a favor
and take them away from him?

760
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:24,121
And the crucifix.
Take it away from him too.

761
01:21:25,254 --> 01:21:28,810
He'll say he wants
to protect me again.

762
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:32,172
From the night,
from Count Dracula,

763
01:21:32,256 --> 01:21:33,956
from everything.

764
01:21:36,086 --> 01:21:38,282
I don't know what to believe.

765
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:40,259
But he might be right.

766
01:21:41,348 --> 01:21:45,053
He told me some terrible
things about that Count Dracula.

767
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:05,487
What is it?
What's wrong with you?

768
01:22:05,568 --> 01:22:07,183
Why?

769
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:10,552
Your eyes. They look at me
in such a strange way!

770
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:17,322
Oh! Eva!

771
01:22:25,067 --> 01:22:26,914
Eva, my daughter!

772
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:28,891
It's all right, Eva, my love.

773
01:22:45,998 --> 01:22:47,348
The cross.

774
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:48,395
Juan!

775
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:53,609
After what's happened,
I can't look at it.

776
01:22:54,277 --> 01:22:56,441
But... What's happened?

777
01:22:58,146 --> 01:23:01,354
I can't tell you!
I can't!

778
01:23:02,363 --> 01:23:05,572
You must tell me.
I have a right to know.

779
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,052
Dracula.

780
01:23:16,368 --> 01:23:17,603
He came.

781
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:21,118
He opened a vein in his arm

782
01:23:22,868 --> 01:23:24,452
and forced me

783
01:23:26,737 --> 01:23:28,437
to drink.

784
01:23:40,047 --> 01:23:43,328
What is it?
Who is it, Martin?

785
01:23:43,412 --> 01:23:45,375
A bat, Professor.

786
01:23:45,463 --> 01:23:48,238
Very big and black.

787
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:52,153
Don't waste your
pellets. It's no use.

788
01:23:53,046 --> 01:23:56,255
You'll never harm that bat.

789
01:23:57,301 --> 01:23:59,307
What can we do?

790
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:03,604
He's crazy.

791
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:06,429
They're all crazy.

792
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:09,908
All of them, except you and me.

793
01:24:11,036 --> 01:24:14,392
And sometimes I even
have my doubts about you.

794
01:27:05,098 --> 01:27:07,104
It was a good deed,

795
01:27:07,187 --> 01:27:10,512
driving a stake through
the heart of that poor girl.

796
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:14,760
Now her soul will rest in peace.

797
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,189
Let's go to the abbey.

798
01:28:16,983 --> 01:28:19,526
Look! An opening
in the wall.

799
01:28:20,232 --> 01:28:21,235
Master!

800
01:28:21,934 --> 01:28:24,520
Master, here I am!

801
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:26,412
Here I am!

802
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:29,163
Eva! Eva!

803
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,162
He went in this way!

804
01:28:37,255 --> 01:28:39,999
I didn't bring them here,
Master! I swear!

805
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,975
I didn't know, Master!

806
01:28:44,374 --> 01:28:45,302
Wait!

807
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:50,056
Master! Master!
I've always been faithful!

808
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,615
I am your slave.
I did not betray you!

809
01:28:55,053 --> 01:28:56,899
Don't kill me, Master

810
01:28:57,026 --> 01:29:00,466
Punish me! Torture me!
But let me live!

811
01:29:00,508 --> 01:29:02,788
I cannot go before God

812
01:29:02,907 --> 01:29:05,303
with so many deaths
on my conscience

813
01:29:05,421 --> 01:29:08,049
and so much blood on my hands!

814
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,374
He came in through here!

815
01:29:41,634 --> 01:29:43,016
Eva! Eva!

816
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:54,971
Use this pole, Harker!

817
01:30:42,879 --> 01:30:44,304
I've got it.

818
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:47,558
Eva, we're here!

819
01:30:55,762 --> 01:30:57,462
Eva! Eva!

820
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:00,017
Eva!

821
01:31:05,589 --> 01:31:07,289
Eva! Eva!

822
01:31:07,369 --> 01:31:09,490
Harker! Harker!

823
01:31:09,536 --> 01:31:11,657
I found them.

824
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:17,267
Look.

825
01:31:32,091 --> 01:31:35,416
His life as a vampire

826
01:31:36,656 --> 01:31:38,777
is coming to an end.

827
01:31:46,716 --> 01:31:48,415
What about Eva?

828
01:31:50,081 --> 01:31:52,825
You must be brave.

829
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:57,039
Find me a stone.

830
01:31:57,974 --> 01:31:59,631
Something

831
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:04,936
that I can use to drive a stake

832
01:32:05,596 --> 01:32:07,411
through his heart.

833
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:39,249
What about Eva?
Is she...

834
01:32:41,151 --> 01:32:42,850
She's not here.

835
01:32:44,904 --> 01:32:47,025
Then she's still alive!

836
01:32:49,624 --> 01:32:50,774
Where are you?

837
01:33:17,983 --> 01:33:20,643
Eva! Eva! Where are you?

838
01:33:20,923 --> 01:33:23,160
Eva! Eva! Eva!

839
01:33:23,361 --> 01:33:25,556
You're safe, Eva!

840
01:33:26,959 --> 01:33:28,964
You're safe!

841
01:33:34,348 --> 01:33:36,892
Oh, Juan!

842
01:33:45,994 --> 01:33:49,234
You should have seen
the horrible look on his face

843
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,064
when he saw the sunlight.

844
01:33:53,113 --> 01:33:55,309
There is nothing to fear now.

845
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:58,990
Dracula is dead forever.

846
01:34:06,886 --> 01:34:08,585
Aren't you coming?

847
01:34:08,704 --> 01:34:10,013
I'm staying behind.

848
01:34:10,136 --> 01:34:14,420
I shall make good
on my promise to Renfield.
