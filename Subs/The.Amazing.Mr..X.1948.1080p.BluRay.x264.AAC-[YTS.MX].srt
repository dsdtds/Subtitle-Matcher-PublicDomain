3
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,358
Christine...

4
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,082
Christine...

5
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Christine...

6
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,140
Christine...

7
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,245
Why, Chris.

8
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,664
- Oh, hello, Janet.

9
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:06,502
- Explain yourself.

10
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:07,669
- Explain what?

11
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,296
- Brooding on the balcony.

12
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,505
It just isn't being
done this season.

13
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,382
- I wasn't brooding.

14
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,427
- Lying to one's sister's
out this season, too.

15
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,470
- Strangest thing happened.

16
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,348
I thought I heard a man's
voice out over the ocean,

17
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,225
calling my name.

18
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,561
- Next time he calls, ask him
if he has a friend for me.

19
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,687
- I'm serious.

20
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,689
- How can you be serious?

21
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,858
It was the wind,
or those fog horns.

22
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,737
- Perhaps, but it
sounded like...

23
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,660
- It's been two
years now, Christine.

24
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,661
- I know.

25
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,291
But for a moment
out over the ocean,

26
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,252
I felt very close to him again.

27
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,423
He used to love the ocean,
you know, especially at night.

28
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,425
He'd go racing down to
the beach for a swim,

29
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,677
no matter how late it was.

30
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,389
And usually I'd be fool
enough to go with him.

31
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,351
- Any husband of mine ever
chased me into the ocean

32
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:06,354
in the middle of the
night, I'd shoot him.

33
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,650
- He did a lot of crazy
things, some of them bad,

34
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:14,235
but I don't think I could
ever love another man

35
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,654
the way I loved Paul.

36
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,324
- Chris, you've gotta
stop talking like this.

37
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,784
You're getting morbid!

38
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,329
- Oh, it's not as bad
as all that, brat.

39
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,498
- It is bad.

40
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,125
Look at this dress.

41
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,378
You can't wear black when
you're going out on a date.

42
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,714
Looks as if you were still, well

43
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,840
- in mourning?

44
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,384
- Well, yes.

45
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,886
- I just happen to
like black, that's all.

46
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,597
- I know, but just for tonight,

47
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,849
it isn't exactly appropriate.

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,646
And Chris, don't wear your
wedding ring tonight either.

49
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,647
- Why not?

50
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,525
- It might make it
awkward for Martin.

51
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,820
- Oh, is Martin going to
propose again tonight?

52
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:57,821
- Well, he might.

53
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,990
And he can't very well
put an engagement ring

54
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,909
on your finger if
that's already there.

55
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,912
- By the way, what kind of a
ring has Martin bought for me?

56
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,289
-An enormous diamond with

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,209
oh, Chris, you will say
yes tonight, won't you?

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,254
- I suppose I'd better,
otherwise he might sue you

59
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,630
for breach of promise.

60
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,674
- Darling, I'm so
excited, and I've got

61
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,844
just the right dress
all picked out for you.

62
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,429
Will you wear it?

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,847
- Anything you say.

64
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,641
And bring out my new
ermine, will you?

65
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,855
-You know, Chris, I think
your cloak with the sequins

66
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,399
might look better
on you tonight.

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,360
- I take it you have a
date for tonight, too.

68
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,028
- As a matter of fact, I have.

69
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,614
-All right, I'll wear the
sequins, you wear the ermine.

70
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,452
- Well, if you insist, thanks.

71
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,537
I like your hair like that.

72
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,456
Of course, you could do
with a little more lipstick.

73
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,667
-And you could do
with a little less.

74
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,507
- Do you suppose it's Martin?

75
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,342
- You know Martin would
never honk a horn at a lady.

76
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,470
It's probably your young man.

77
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,013
By the way, which young
man is it tonight?

78
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,514
- It's...

79
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,932
You know, I've forgotten.

80
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,768
- Have a good time
and come home early.

81
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:10,894
- Well, I can't do both.

82
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,604
- Then you come home early.

83
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:13,731
- You come home engaged.

84
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,705
- Mrs. Faber's residence.

85
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,457
Yes sir.

86
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:35,836
Mrs. Faber.

87
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,842
It's Mr. Labbitz, ma'am.

88
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,386
- Thank you, Emily,
I'll take it here.

89
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,847
Hello, Martin.

90
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,432
Don't tell me you're
standing me up.

91
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,851
- No, no, it's just
that some idiotic client

92
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,979
came into the office at
the last minute, and I

93
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,441
well no, I know it's not
serious, but I particularly

94
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,736
didn't want to have anything
interfere with tonight.

95
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,613
Well, no, you see, I wanted
to show you that I'm not

96
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:07,992
always the lawyer with his
mind on cases and affidavits.

97
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,788
No, I'm really the romantic
type with my mind on you.

98
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,124
Yeah, I thought it
was a nice speech.

99
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,585
I dreamed it up this
afternoon in felony court.

100
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,379
- It doesn't matter if
we're a little late, Martin.

101
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,756
The first act's no good anyway.

102
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,092
I'll walk over along
the beach to your house,

103
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,927
then you won't have to waste
the time driving over here.

104
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,638
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.

105
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,014
- But I want to
walk over, Martin.

106
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,015
I'll enjoy it.

107
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,768
Oh, of course it's safe.

108
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,812
Now stop talking
like an old maid.

109
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:36,813
Goodbye.

110
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,607
- It is dark down there, ma'am.

111
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,443
-And you, Emily, stop
talking like Martin abbott.

112
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,945
Lock the patio door
after me, will you?

113
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,613
Good night.

114
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,813
Christine...

115
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,738
Christine...

116
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,625
Christine...

117
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,933
Christine...

118
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:04,836
Chris...

119
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,755
Chris...

120
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,060
Chris...

121
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,576
- I don't blame you
for being frightened.

122
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,120
You made a decision
tonight that angered him,

123
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,040
and now you're
fighting to sustain it.

124
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,877
You have all my hopes
fighting with you, madam.

125
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,798
I think you were married.

126
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,801
I saw your husband dead,
and you were moving toward

127
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,056
a new marriage, but
I see I was wrong.

128
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,182
Sometimes I am.

129
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,144
Good night, goodbye.

130
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,317
- Wait.

131
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,111
You weren't mistaken.

132
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,155
My husband died two years ago.

133
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,240
- In my fate I
could not be wrong.

134
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,037
I saw him, dead, and
his car in flames.

135
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,665
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,209
- I don't understand
how you know all this.

137
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,169
I suppose people do talk.

138
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,837
Do you live around here?

139
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,507
- No, I wish I did
live on the ocean.

140
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,205
Here is my name
and where I live.

141
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,679
- Alexis.

142
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,973
Psychic consultant.

143
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,226
Oh.

144
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,103
- I see you place me
in the same category

145
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,773
with fortune tellers, snake
charmers, and magicians.

146
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,983
Oh well, many people do.

147
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,152
- But you must know who I am.

148
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,613
How else would you
know all these things?

149
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,992
- Perhaps because we're
very much alike, you and I.

150
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,163
Free spirits, both of
us, like my friend here.

151
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,917
We like the night,
the mist of the ocean.

152
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,670
The wind whispers
to us and the sand

153
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,047
feels cool under our feet.

154
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:18,219
We're not like, oh, I have
his name now, like Martin.

155
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,138
- There's nothing
wrong with Martin.

156
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,014
- Of course not.

157
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,351
If only he would understand
how little he understands.

158
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,104
- Well, Martin is very logical.

159
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,023
- Yes, that's why
you should marry him.

160
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,110
Even free spirits
have to come in

161
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,696
out of the night sometimes
and put on their shoes,

162
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,031
pay their bills,
go to the dentist,

163
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,076
and of course, family
dinners on Sunday.

164
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,412
You really shouldn't
be so irritated

165
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:48,041
by his little mannerisms, like
when he clears his throat,

166
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,335
announcing that he's going
to kiss you any minute,

167
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,421
or when he counts
off all his plans

168
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,882
on the tips of his fingers.

169
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,717
- How could... how?

170
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,720
I can't tell you how
I know these things.

171
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,055
But it hardly matters, does it?

172
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,807
Since we're not
going to meet again.

173
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,729
Chris!

174
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,339
Oh, over here, Martin.

175
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,110
- Hello.

176
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,867
- But you certainly
had me scared.

177
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,243
What kept you so long?

178
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,120
- Well, I was
talking to this man.

179
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,706
Well, he was here.

180
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,917
Or I've imagined him.

181
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,252
He was fantastic enough.

182
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,088
- Well, let's get going.

183
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,965
- Oh, I tore my dress, Martin,

184
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,884
I'll have to go
back to the house.

185
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,302
- All right.

186
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,971
We'll go to your house
first, skip the theater,

187
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,265
directly to the blue angel.

188
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,810
What's the matter?

189
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,479
- Nothing, it's just
that it's so late,

190
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,107
and I'm a little upset, could
we make it some other night?

191
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,108
- Of course.

192
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,486
- Are you sure you understand?

193
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,154
- When it concerns
you, Christine,

194
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,989
there's nothing I
don't understand.

195
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,709
Here, you better take
this off my hands,

196
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,419
or I'll have to wear it
to the office tomorrow.

197
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,296
- Fix yourself a drink, I've
gotta change this torn dress.

198
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,297
- Right.

199
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,078
- Martin, how flattering.

200
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,913
I should have thought
of this in the first place.

201
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,832
This is much better
than any nightclub.

202
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,502
- Yes, and just think, no head
waiter, no smoke, no people.

203
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,130
-And at the end of
the evening, no check.

204
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,008
- Oh Martin, you think
in such practical terms.

205
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,176
- I'm a very practical man.

206
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,471
For instance, I just said
that to make you pout.

207
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,974
The better to do this.

208
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,104
- I've been trapped.

209
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:16,063
- Right.

210
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,982
Now, if you'll just step over
here to the sofa by the fire.

211
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:18,900
- Another trap?

212
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
- Definitely.

213
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,558
Darling, what's the matter?

214
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,060
- That music.

215
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,227
- It's just the phonograph.

216
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,312
- But we don't have that record.

217
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,897
- Of course you do.

218
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,258
It was right on
top of the cabinet.

219
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,859
- That's strange.

220
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,944
- What's the matter, Chris?

221
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,948
- I'm sorry, but that was
Paul's favorite prelude.

222
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,116
I've heard him play
it a hundred times

223
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,243
right here in this room.

224
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,871
Turn it off, will you?

225
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:15,873
- No, I won't.

226
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,379
Look, darling.

227
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,548
Paul's been gone too long
for you to act like this.

228
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:25,925
- I know.

229
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,221
I'm not saying this for my sake,

230
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,015
but your whole
life's ahead of you.

231
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,519
You can't waste it
probing into the past.

232
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,897
If I can't make you forget Paul,

233
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,566
well, find someone else who can.

234
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,527
- You're right, Martin.

235
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,321
I'm sorry I acted like a child.

236
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,407
Would you get me a drink?

237
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,118
- Right here ready for you.

238
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,333
- So you think I should
go find somebody new?

239
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
- Oh...

240
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,963
Only if it's
absolutely necessary.

241
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,464
- But I've been so out of touch

242
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,968
with people lately,
especially men.

243
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,178
- What do you expect me
to do, bring some around?

244
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,347
- Well, that would
be very nice of you.

245
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,143
Well, you know how hard it
is for me to meet new people.

246
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,398
- Well, I can see I'll just
have to propose to you.

247
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,066
- Oh Martin, I
talked you into it.

248
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,319
- You sure did, and very
fortunately for you,

249
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,948
I just happen to have an
engagement ring on me.

250
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,959
- Martin, it's lovely.

251
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,228
Yes, Paul?

252
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,273
Can't you
hear the ocean calling?

253
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,403
Come on, Chris, race
you to the beach.

254
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,448
- Last one in's a coward.

255
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,328
- Oh!

256
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,849
Chris!

257
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Chris.

258
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,451
Darling.

259
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,247
-Janet

260
00:20:47,248 --> 00:20:48,580
- what happened?

261
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,749
- I don't know.

262
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,877
The music.

263
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:56,715
- Let me help you up.

264
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,928
Look darling, you
must've had a nightmare.

265
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,638
It's all right now.

266
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,683
It's over, you're
awake, and I'm here.

267
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,185
- Janet, it wasn't a dream.

268
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,937
The windows blew open.

269
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,440
- What's so unusual about
a window blowing open?

270
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,483
- My engagement ring was gone.

271
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,861
The flowers were all withered.

272
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,196
- Chris, look.

273
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,412
- But the picture,
Paul's picture.

274
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,792
You see?

275
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,793
Just a bad dream.

276
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,670
- I was awake.

277
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,631
My wedding gown,
there in the closet.

278
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,260
It came toward me,
I swear it did.

279
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,474
- It's just your bathrobe.

280
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,809
You probably pulled
the door open like this

281
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,687
and it flung out like that.

282
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,899
- My wedding dress isn't there?

283
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,984
How could it be, Chris?

284
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,404
It's been locked in the
trunk room for years.

285
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,449
- It wasn't a
nightmare, I tell you.

286
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,493
I saw those things.

287
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,953
I think it was Paul and he
doesn't want me to marry.

288
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,914
- You got some feeling
that it's not loyal to Paul

289
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:13,582
if you marry again.

290
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,543
It's in your conscience
and it makes you dream.

291
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,837
Why don't you talk it
over with an analyst?

292
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,963
- He wouldn't understand.

293
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,673
He'd think I was losing my mind.

294
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,967
Nobody would understand.

295
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,804
Except perhaps Alexis.

296
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:27,930
- Alexis?

297
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,681
- Just somebody I once met.

298
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,682
- Come on.

299
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,603
Get to bed.

300
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,816
It's after three.

301
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,737
You haven't got time for
any more dreams tonight.

302
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,031
-Janefl

303
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:51,913
while you're up, would you
get me a glass of water?

304
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,050
Thanks.

305
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,050
Janet

306
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,346
- I thought I was supposed
to be the baby in the family.

307
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,640
Here, give me that water.

308
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,893
Move over, baby.

309
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,398
Night, Chris.

310
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,399
- Night.

311
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,905
Childish, isn't it?

312
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,075
- I think the ocean and the
fog were more effective.

313
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,995
- I agree.

314
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,831
But in my work, I deal with
many different kinds of minds.

315
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,000
Generally speaking, I
think you could say that

316
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,461
three types of people
come here to see me.

317
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,007
The first, a very large
group, come here to scoff,

318
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,386
and sometimes a few of
them remain to pray.

319
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,931
The second have childlike,
credulous minds.

320
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,557
They long to believe.

321
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,728
They're tired and
sad and need comfort.

322
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,772
All this helps them.

323
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,442
It creates an atmosphere.

324
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,152
You see?

325
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,154
Mood, like music,
and in it, they find

326
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,865
a few brief moments of
comfort, which helps them

327
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,494
to continue with their
gray little lives.

328
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,039
And so I do not think it is
so childish after all, do you?

329
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,457
-And the third group?

330
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,167
-Ah.

331
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,004
The third group is those
of us who honestly explore

332
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,965
the secrets of the outer world.

333
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,886
I feel that you have come
here today to join that group.

334
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,889
- Well, I did want to talk
to you about something.

335
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,890
- I know.

336
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,477
He was close to you last night.

337
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,024
And he's close to
you now, but wait.

338
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,112
Maybe I should repel him,
not bring him closer.

339
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,113
- Why?

340
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,827
- His presence is so strong,
it might be dangerous.

341
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,664
- How could Paul's presence
possibly be dangerous to me?

342
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,665
- To your plans.

343
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,669
You want to get married
and lead what is

344
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,213
termed a normal life.

345
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,883
- But if Paul is
trying to reach me,

346
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,427
then I want to help him.

347
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:38,138
- Have you thought
what people will think?

348
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,724
What Martin will think?

349
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,852
- I'm not afraid to
think as I choose.

350
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,605
- Then, Christine, if
you have the courage

351
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,525
and the will to explore,
I will help you.

352
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,110
Now relax.

353
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,031
Let your mind be
free and receptive.

354
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,166
- Janet, you do have a
tendency to dramatize, and-

355
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,168
- stop treating me like a child.

356
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,087
I tell you she's been going
to see him for weeks, and-

357
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,088
- shh!

358
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:16,968
- Now do you believe me?

359
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,969
- Hmm.

360
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,227
- She's been reading
psychic books, too,

361
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,688
talking about Paul as
if he was still alive.

362
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,024
Gives me the creeps.

363
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,150
- Let's go.

364
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,985
- Now what are we gonna do?

365
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,612
- We're gonna get a
detective, see what he can

366
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,906
find out about
this spook chaser.

367
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,700
- For 20 years,
I've been operating

368
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,328
among these phony mediums
as a private detective,

369
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,747
and I've yet to find one
concrete bit of evidence

370
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,290
of communication with the dead.

371
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,001
- But my sister's
absolutely convinced.

372
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,628
He's told her things
he couldn't know,

373
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,296
unless he were psychic.

374
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,798
- He's probably gone
to a lot of trouble

375
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,341
to investigate her past.

376
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,968
They're thorough and clever.

377
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,886
- What I can't
understand is Christine

378
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,264
falling for such drivel.

379
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,684
- You'd be amazed
what people will do.

380
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,269
- No thanks.

381
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,187
- But there's a millionaire
right in this town

382
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,816
wouldn't buy a bag of popcorn
without consulting his medium.

383
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,693
What's this one's name?

384
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:15,694
- Alexis.

385
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,615
- That's a new one on me.

386
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
But then they change
their names often enough.

387
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,079
How about a description?

388
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:29,167
- There's a picture of him
in this pamphlet he wrote.

389
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,673
- Oh, this?

390
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,675
I used to be a magician.

391
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,052
That's how I got
into this racket.

392
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,816
I know all their tricks.

393
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,028
Alexis.

394
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,033
I was called to
Chicago on a case once,

395
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,076
gentleman named mar...

396
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,193
Swindled a society lady out
of a whole hat full of money.

397
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,374
If that's Alexis, he
certainly used to look corny.

398
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,709
If that's Alexis, we can

399
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,710
report him to the police.

400
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,046
What charge?

401
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,527
He served his stretch
and that's that.

402
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,966
- At least Christine'll
be through with him.

403
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,760
I mean, if we can
prove he's a crook.

404
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,220
- How can we identify him?

405
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,888
- Well, I could go out
there and try to get

406
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,058
his fingerprints, but
I think the only time

407
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,936
that these fakes
are really psychic

408
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,104
is when there's a
detective around.

409
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,775
- Yeah, and they look in their
crystals and see you coming.

410
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,402
- Maybe we could send
somebody he wouldn't know.

411
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,364
- Oh no, I think that...

412
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:29,864
- Your name, please.

413
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,116
- Harper.

414
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,034
Mrs. Charles Harper.

415
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,245
- Not Mrs. Charles g. Harper.

416
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,913
- Yes.

417
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:37,914
I mean no.

418
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,220
- Now concentrate,
and soon your thoughts

419
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,431
will merge with mine.

420
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,185
Perhaps both hands
would be better.

421
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,108
So much better.

422
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,320
I can feel your vibrations
much more clearly now.

423
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,075
But your pulse is racing.

424
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:17,287
Are you excited, nervous?

425
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,125
- Oh, but of course this
problem is troubling you.

426
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,419
The question you
wrote comes to me,

427
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,799
but faintly, almost
as though it were...

428
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:30,968
False.

429
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,598
But then another
question comes through,

430
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,935
with all the power and
strength of love and truth.

431
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:44,397
You are concerned about
someone you love, a woman.

432
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:45,398
Your sister.

433
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,066
Is it your sister?

434
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,526
- Yes.

435
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,153
- Older than you,
but still you have

436
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:53,199
a maternal, protective
feeling about her.

437
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,494
In many ways, you are
more mature than she.

438
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:02,123
- Golly, I'm glad somebody
finally realized that.

439
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,918
- Of course, you didn't
always feel that way.

440
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,628
Once you were jealous of her.

441
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,547
You envied her popularity
and her pretty clothes.

442
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,342
You used to try them
on when she went out,

443
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,260
and this suited you
because there is an air

444
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,306
of maturity and
sophistication about you.

445
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,351
In many ways, especially
intellectually,

446
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:24,229
you are much older than the
many young men who admire you.

447
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,191
-You know, I noticed that.

448
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:31,195
- Does this feel
uncomfortable to you?

449
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,951
- I think I'll have a cigarette.

450
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
- Mrs. Harper?

451
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,918
Mrs. Harper?

452
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:50,922
May I?

453
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,410
- An attractive case.

454
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:41,097
- Did you know
why I wanted them?

455
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,601
Nor do I need to.

456
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:46,979
It is enough for me to
know that you wanted them.

457
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:58,281
-Alexis, I hope that
nothing you've done

458
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,492
to help my sister will get you
into trouble with the police.

459
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,622
I mean, if they should
investigate you, or your past life,

460
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:08,541
will they find anything that
would make trouble for you?

461
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,795
There are there are
many things in my life

462
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:17,676
of which I'm ashamed, but,
and this may sound strange,

463
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,680
the memory that I Cherish
is a term in prison.

464
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,681
Oh.

465
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,559
There are many brave
men who were imprisoned

466
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,520
in their fight for
science and truth,

467
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,231
and I'm proud to be one of them.

468
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:36,528
I think you may be able
to understand this.

469
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:41,157
Oh, but anyway, do with
this as you think best.

470
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,158
I trust you.

471
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,252
- Hey Janet.

472
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,130
- Oh, hello, Martin.

473
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,371
- Did you get the fingerprints?

474
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:40,675
- But I erased them.

475
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,345
Oh, Martin, he isn't at
all the kind of a man

476
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,389
we thought he was.

477
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:16,169
-Ah, hello dear, did
you get the day off?

478
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,587
- No time to.

479
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,798
Yeah, Mrs. Faber,
no, Mrs. Faber.

480
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm getting sick of it.

481
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,385
-And how is our clown?

482
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,595
- She's hooked good.

483
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:27,638
- Hmm, good, she is.

484
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,184
And does she feel that her
beloved husband is close to her?

485
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,643
- I'm surprised she
hasn't me to lay

486
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,229
an extra place at
the dinner table.

487
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,607
Here's a photograph
of her parents.

488
00:38:37,608 --> 00:38:39,525
It was in the trunk where
I found the wedding dress.

489
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,154
- Oh, that will be very useful.

490
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:46,616
- When are you gonna
put the bite on it?

491
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:49,619
- Oh, Vivian, you put
things so crudely.

492
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,205
I imagine that very soon,
Mrs. Faber is going to

493
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:54,832
press money on me to
continue my psychic research.

494
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,502
I'm getting sick of
this Swedish accent.

495
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,920
I need a new role.

496
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,588
- Oh, I have a new
assignment for you,

497
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,757
straight from the
obituary column.

498
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,759
A lonely millionaire who...

499
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,514
I had no more
appointments today.

500
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:13,351
Oh, here, help me get these
things out of the way.

501
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,520
- What do you pay for those
chunks of glass these days?

502
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:18,648
- $3 a piece, used to $1.95.

503
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:19,816
You know, somebody
ought to do something

504
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,443
about this high cost of living.

505
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,320
- You should complain.

506
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,865
You're selling 'em for 25
bucks to your psychic students.

507
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,910
-I used to, but who am
I to fight inflation?

508
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,579
I'm charging 50 now.

509
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,334
Hmm, expensive car.

510
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,379
Expensive clothes.

511
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,757
I would say no brains
and lots of money.

512
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:46,342
So long as you're here, Vivian,

513
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,802
you might as well
check the car for me.

514
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,303
There might be some
papers or something

515
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,638
in the glove compartment.

516
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,473
- Okay.

517
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,474
- I'll use a turban in case
you find out something.

518
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:51,574
- Oh!

519
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,705
This is such a pleasure,
I mean, I've heard...

520
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,974
- I'd rather not
tonight, Martin, really.

521
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,310
I'm much too tired.

522
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,897
Well, let's decide
about Friday later.

523
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:23,982
Call me tomorrow.

524
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,360
Good night.

525
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:29,279
- Will that's be
all, Mrs. Faber?

526
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,407
- That's all, Emily, thanks.

527
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,791
Chris.

528
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,416
- Hmm?

529
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,918
- Can't you and I spend
the evening together?

530
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,878
If you're tired we
could go to a movie.

531
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,590
- Actually, I'm busy tonight,
Janet, I have an appointment.

532
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,551
- Chris, don't see
Alexis tonight.

533
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,512
Don't see him ever again.

534
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,764
- Janet, I thought we
agreed not to discuss this.

535
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,933
- I'm not attacking,
Alexis, honest.

536
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:02,728
I think he'd be very
good, for certain people.

537
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:03,730
- But not for me?

538
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:07,441
- Well, you see,
when some people meet

539
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,777
a fascinating
personality, they're swept

540
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,445
right off their feet.

541
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,822
Like me?

542
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:13,823
- Yes.

543
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,869
But other people can be
more objective, like me.

544
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:24,000
It's true, Chris, in many ways
I'm more mature than you are.

545
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,961
- Janet, I have lived through
most of your growing pains,

546
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,630
and often times you've been
insufferable, but tonight-

547
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,966
- you see, you
can't be objective.

548
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,592
You're getting sore
just because I'm trying

549
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,469
to give you some good advice.

550
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,595
- Give me advice?

551
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,014
Janet, please.

552
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:40,100
- It is good advice,
Alexis agrees with me.

553
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,020
- Alexis agrees with you?

554
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:49,692
- Well, you see, I've
talked to him a few times

555
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:50,944
about your problem.

556
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,657
I went to his house.

557
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:57,993
- How did you find him?

558
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:00,912
- Fascinating.

559
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,458
Absolutely fascinating.

560
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,423
You know, he has one of the
most vibrant personalities.

561
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:13,966
-And you came to this conclusion

562
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,469
while discussing my problem?

563
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,972
- Well, we talked a
little about me, too.

564
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,890
- Janet...

565
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:23,934
Good night.

566
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:27,189
I'll leave you alone
with your objectivity.

567
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,911
- Alexis, I had to see you.

568
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,287
Don't pay any attention to her.

569
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:27,164
- I feel a disturbance.

570
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,875
If we are to reach the
outer world tonight,

571
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,752
we must leave behind
us all thoughts

572
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:35,549
that are hostile, and on
a low emotional level.

573
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,595
Now Janet, this is
your first seance.

574
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,681
There must be some
skepticism in your mind.

575
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:46,892
- Perhaps in your subconscious
mind, but nevertheless,

576
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,853
we shall proceed
under test conditions.

577
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:51,148
If you would be good enough
to hold this key for me?

578
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:55,317
And Christine, will you tie
my wrists together securely?

579
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,027
- Oh, there's no need
to do that, Alexis.

580
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,654
I have every faith in you.

581
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,322
- Oh, but I insist,
for my own sake.

582
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,992
- Here, Chris, you take the
key, I'll tie his wrist.

583
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:05,120
-All right, Janet,
start with the right one.

584
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:08,790
Tie one knot in the center.

585
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Tightly.

586
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:13,252
That's good.

587
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,255
Now tie my hands behind my back.

588
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:18,674
Very tightly.

589
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,138
Thank you.

590
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,311
Now lock the cabinet,
so that you know

591
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,647
that I cannot possibly
move from this chair.

592
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,865
Now Christine, will you
switch off the light?

593
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:45,660
The switch is right
in behind you.

594
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,998
The room must be
completely dark.

595
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:52,876
Sit down on the table.

596
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,841
And clasp your hands
together tightly,

597
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,010
with the key between your palms.

598
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:13,063
If you see anything at all,
do not move around or cry out.

599
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,186
- Chris, look.

600
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,856
I'm remembering very well.

601
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:58,858
Isn't that...

602
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,736
- Yes, Janet.

603
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,154
It's dad.

604
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,338
Do you feel it, Janet?

605
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,339
The chill?

606
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,680
- Cold breeze, like ice.

607
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:12,389
I'd sure like to know

608
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,308
what's going on in there.

609
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,852
If he's staging a seance,
it'll be a good opportunity

610
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,978
to prove he's a phony.

611
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,438
- Let's sneak around back.

612
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:20,439
There may be a window
we can look through.

613
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
- Or climb through.

614
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:49,802
- Paul.

615
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,948
Martin, what are you doing?

616
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,449
- Showing you what
a phony this man is.

617
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,450
Where's the key?

618
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:18,331
- If you think he's
still in here

619
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:32,387
- What is it?

620
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,390
- He's quick on his feet,
I'll say that for him.

621
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,225
How could he get
out when I locked him in?

622
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,144
- He could show you
if he wanted to.

623
00:49:40,145 --> 00:49:42,480
You tie a knot like
this, and then...

624
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:48,026
- Martin, this is dreadful.
- Yes it is.

625
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,362
I'm afraid I must insist
you don't come here again.

626
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,572
- Insist?

627
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:52,990
By what right do you insist?

628
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,075
- Well, we're engaged.

629
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,578
- Even if we were married,
I'd think as I pleased.

630
00:49:57,579 --> 00:49:59,455
And I won't close
my mind to truth

631
00:49:59,456 --> 00:50:00,998
just because you don't
happen to understand them.

632
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,207
- Truth, poppycock.

633
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:05,085
Be logical, Chris, be logical.

634
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,879
- Pardon me Mr. Abbott.

635
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,381
Do you think you could
possibly defer your discussion

636
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,383
long enough to untie this rope?

637
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,802
- Oh, I'm sorry
Alexis, I'll do it.

638
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,304
- I happen to understand
more about these things

639
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:16,930
than you do.

640
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,390
Do you realize that man
has a criminal record?

641
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,808
-Alexis told us he
was once in prison,

642
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:21,560
if that's what you mean.

643
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,479
- Sometimes a prison record
is something to be proud of.

644
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,356
- I'm terribly sorry about
this interruption, Alexis.

645
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,525
I saw him, I saw Paul.

646
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,110
- Oh, we will bring him back.

647
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,112
- Even if you could
bring him back,

648
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,406
she'd be better off if he
stayed where he is, dead.

649
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,366
She never meant anything
to him but money.

650
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,035
- Martin!

651
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,161
- He'd been married
and divorced before,

652
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,579
each time with cash settlements.

653
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,456
If he'd lived, he'd
have made you miserable

654
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:45,584
and ended up where
he belongs, in jail.

655
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,960
I never thought you'd attack

656
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,962
a dead man with iazycan answers.

657
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,380
- Chris, it's in the records.

658
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,341
When Martin disappeared,
did you or did you not

659
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,468
ask me to investigate?

660
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,011
Yes.

661
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,638
- Well, in the course
of my snooping,

662
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:00,599
I found a second Mrs.
Faber, divorced in Las Vegas

663
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,018
just six months
before he married you.

664
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:05,479
I think he went over
there to see her.

665
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,649
I never could find her,
though, and Paul was dead, so-

666
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,984
- seems very strange
that, if it were true,

667
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,904
you didn't find it necessary
to tell Mrs. Faber.

668
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,281
- Yes, I suppose it is strange.

669
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,327
And very silly to try and
protect the girl you love.

670
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:24,040
She only runs as fast as she
can to another phony like you.

671
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,001
Come on, hoffmann,
let's get outta here.

672
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,419
- Going so soon?

673
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,004
I hoped we might
stay around a while.

674
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,673
- You should stay.

675
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,675
You'd soon learn what
amazing powers Alexis has.

676
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:37,010
- I'm always willing to learn.

677
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,429
Perhaps you'd like
to resume the seance.

678
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:44,059
- Yes, under real
test conditions.

679
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,396
-And have you report me
for conducting a seance?

680
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,189
I should say not.

681
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,567
- He probably could
report you now,

682
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:54,027
but if you'll sit down
here at this table,

683
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:57,281
and while we all hold hands
like real good friends,

684
00:51:57,282 --> 00:52:00,200
you can make any of your
spirits walk or talk,

685
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:03,036
I think Mr. Hoffman will
let it ride this time.

686
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,204
- It's ridiculous.

687
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,539
- Show them, Alexis.

688
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,624
- Yes, Alexis.

689
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,086
- I'm afraid under such
hostile circumstances,

690
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:12,212
any contact with a spirit world

691
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,131
will be practically impossible.

692
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,425
- Yeah, yeah, I've heard
that patter routine before.

693
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,135
I know it's easier when you can

694
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:19,636
run around the room in the dark.

695
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,264
- He doesn't run
around in the dark.

696
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:25,560
Go on, Alexis, let them see
for themselves what you can do.

697
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,229
- Okay let's go.

698
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,457
-You know you really
ought to have a hand

699
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:50,709
on the premises for
tight spots like this.

700
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,003
- We checked, you see,
to make sure you hadn't.

701
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,671
- Shh, you talk so loud.

702
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:58,384
You mean we'll frighten
the ghosts?

703
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:37,172
Christine.

704
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:38,590
- You see?

705
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,218
Christine.

706
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:43,095
- It's Paul.

707
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,223
It's his voice.

708
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,142
I didn't mean
to frighten you ever,

709
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,062
but I had to get
through to you somehow.

710
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,920
I've always loved
you, you know that.

711
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,732
-Yes, Paul.

712
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:05,325
- And if you could only believe,

713
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,120
we could be together for always.

714
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:26,430
- There wasn't
anybody out there.

715
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,558
- 20 years, never
anything like this.

716
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:32,644
- If everybody will excuse me,

717
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,272
this has been a terrible strain.

718
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:40,360
- Come on, Chris,
I'll take you home.

719
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,361
- Let's go.

720
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,487
- What are you so
startled about?

721
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,406
You're used to raising
the dead, aren't you?

722
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,658
Although I guess with me,
it was a little easier,

723
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,453
because I'm only legally dead.

724
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:34,706
You know, I've
been watching you,

725
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:38,335
ever since my widow started
coming to you, Alexis.

726
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,171
I find your methods
quite amusing.

727
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,551
Excellent.

728
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,685
How do you get out
of that rope thing?

729
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:57,562
- Manipulation.

730
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,857
But how do you... the cabinet?

731
00:56:04,904 --> 00:56:06,905
Just push a button
and the idiots

732
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,573
reach for their checkbooks.

733
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,742
- It isn't quite as
simple as all that.

734
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,787
There's a lot of psychology
involved, and research.

735
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:15,498
- Sounds dangerously like work.

736
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,417
However, your bag of
tricks can be useful to us

737
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:20,586
in our present plans.

738
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,131
- We have plans?

739
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,300
- I didn't help you out tonight

740
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,677
just for the fun
of it, my friend.

741
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:30,595
I can use you.

742
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:34,432
You see, I need
money, a lot of it.

743
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,685
- I don't understand.

744
00:56:36,686 --> 00:56:38,270
If you went back to Christine,

745
00:56:38,271 --> 00:56:40,188
you could have
anything you want.

746
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,648
- You don't seem to have
a very analytical mind.

747
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:45,277
-I know that Christine
still loves you, she...

748
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:46,278
Oh.

749
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:48,780
You mean if you weren't
dead, the police

750
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:49,948
might want to know
who it was they found

751
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,283
burned to death in your car.

752
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:52,450
- Mm-hmm, exactly.

753
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,331
- Have I been using the
wrong piece of music?

754
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,208
- What?

755
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:00,709
Oh no, no, no.

756
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,295
You have the right
one for Christine.

757
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:04,797
I used this one
for my first wife.

758
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,343
- Was it her ashes
they found in the car?

759
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,681
- It was me they found in
the car, and don't forget it.

760
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:16,766
Perhaps I should
point out that I'm

761
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,561
in a very curious position.

762
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:21,479
Since I'm believed dead,
I could even kill a man.

763
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,566
Nobody'd think of
looking for me.

764
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,861
You're in a curious
position, too, Alexis.

765
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:31,656
You can't tell anybody I'm
alive without exposing yourself.

766
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,366
- That's right, I can't.

767
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,285
It is a very curious position.

768
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,454
- And a profitable one.

769
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,831
I don't think it's too
premature to congratulate you

770
00:57:39,832 --> 00:57:42,335
upon an extremely
advantageous marriage.

771
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:44,711
- Marriage?

772
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,630
- Come come, my friend.

773
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,757
You must be prepared to
make some small sacrifice.

774
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:50,842
- You don't expect me
to marry Christine?

775
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,845
- No, no, the little one, Janet.

776
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,641
She's still young enough
to be dazzled by you.

777
00:57:58,017 --> 00:57:59,601
From then on,
getting that estate

778
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,646
will be like taking
candy away from a baby.

779
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:04,956
- I don't think
Christine would allow it.

780
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,276
- I'll take care of Christine.

781
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,285
I'm a little rusty on this
one, I'll have to practice.

782
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,747
Have this piano tuned, will you?

783
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,936
- Thanks.

784
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:45,480
- Oh, no ma'am, not
for you, not after

785
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,774
the night you've been having.

786
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,360
- And that's for you.
- Hot milk?

787
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,780
- Yes ma'am.
- I'd rather have coffee.

788
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,078
- I'll see that she
drinks it, Emily.

789
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,873
-All right, I'll take it,
but it won't do any good.

790
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,918
-You should really try and
get more sleep, Christine.

791
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:07,920
- I just can't.

792
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:11,631
I'm never alone anymore.

793
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:15,344
I keep hearing his voice
now and seeing his face.

794
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,974
It should comfort me, I suppose,
but it's been frightening.

795
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,728
- Drink your milk while
it's hot, it'll help.

796
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:28,941
- Alexis, do you suppose
we've made a mistake?

797
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:32,152
That first day when
I came to your house,

798
00:59:32,153 --> 00:59:34,446
you said it might be better
to repel Paul's spirit

799
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:35,906
instead of bringing it closer.

800
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:38,451
Perhaps you were right.

801
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,910
- Perhaps I was right.

802
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,537
- Then would it be
better to try to

803
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:43,497
break the contact
now, and not go-

804
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:45,498
- it's too late.

805
00:59:45,499 --> 00:59:47,710
At this stage I could
never break the contact.

806
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,795
We'll have to finish
what we started.

807
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:53,007
- It would only bring me rest.

808
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:58,637
Well, let's begin
the seance now.

809
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,894
- I think that before we
start, you should relax,

810
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:09,147
and I should be more familiar
with the surroundings.

811
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:11,650
It is very difficult for
me in a strange house.

812
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,153
Perhaps if I walked around
the outside for a while.

813
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:16,488
- I'll show you.

814
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:18,865
We can even go to the ocean.

815
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:22,578
- Go ahead, Janet, I'm
feeling rather tired.

816
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,861
- Watch your step,
it's awfully steep.

817
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,977
You know, I think I have
talent along spirit lines.

818
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:30,728
- You do?
- Yes.

819
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,564
I've been reading and studying.

820
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:34,149
I think maybe I'm even a mystic.

821
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:36,901
- You know, that seance we had

822
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,182
at your house when
Paul appeared?

823
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:41,057
- Was that Paul's
first visitation?

824
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:43,158
Alexis?

825
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,827
- Oh, oh yes, it was.

826
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:48,079
- You see, maybe it's
because I was there,

827
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,665
all tuned in and sensitive.

828
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,917
Well, it could be.

829
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,004
Did you ever see a better
spirit manifestation?

830
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,216
- No, darling, that
was an all-time record.

831
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,523
-Are you thinking
about my sister?

832
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:16,524
- Yes.

833
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,970
- She's very
attractive, isn't she?

834
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:21,989
Most men admire Chris.

835
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:25,701
- But Christine will
always belong to Paul.

836
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:27,870
- I suppose that's true.

837
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:31,457
I wish she wouldn't
be so unhappy.

838
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,212
Do you suppose they'll be
joined together someday,

839
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:40,924
in celestial companionship,
through all eternity,

840
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:42,926
like it says in the books?

841
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,595
- Yes, I'm sure they will.

842
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:47,222
- Alexis.

843
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:52,602
Do you think I'd make a
good celestial companion?

844
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,646
- Darling, I think
you'd be wonderful.

845
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:56,898
-And we'd love each other
through all eternity?

846
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:58,108
- Oh, even longer.

847
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:03,614
- Alexis, why don't we start
right here on the earth plane?

848
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,363
- I've come for you, dear.

849
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:34,872
Hurry, Chris.

850
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,334
- Paul, wait.

851
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:42,628
I'm frightened.

852
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,173
- There's nothing
to be afraid of.

853
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:25,714
- Paul, I'm afraid.

854
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:31,387
- Race you to the beach.

855
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,850
- Last one in's a coward.

856
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:00,558
-Alexis, she's not badly hurt.

857
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,226
She's all right?

858
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:03,395
- I think she's all right.

859
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:09,776
(Waves crashin 9

860
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,038
What are you doing here?

861
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,332
- Well, at the moment,
I'm opening the door,

862
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,125
but not very wide.

863
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,377
You're not exactly welcome here.

864
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,046
- Where's Emily?

865
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:32,132
- It's Thursday, Mr.
- Abbott, her day off.

866
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:34,926
- Where's frieda?

867
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:36,385
- Frieda left yesterday.

868
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,066
She said she thought
the house was haunted.

869
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,224
I see what she means.

870
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:43,100
I want to talk to Mrs. Faber.

871
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,062
- I don't think she
wants to talk to you.

872
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:48,231
-Janet

873
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,024
where's Chris?

874
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,402
- She's making herself ill
with this morbid nonsense.

875
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,029
- Oh, it isn't that.

876
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:57,281
Chris had a fall last
night on the cliff.

877
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,951
She might have killed herself
if Alexis hadn't caught her.

878
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:02,245
What was she doing on the cliff?

879
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:03,246
- Well...

880
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,999
She thought she
heard Paul calling.

881
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,084
- Janet?

882
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,296
We'll always be together, Chris.

883
01:08:14,091 --> 01:08:16,259
Together for always.

884
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,260
-Yes, Paul.

885
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,847
-You'll always be mine, Chris.

886
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,607
Chris, I'm waiting.

887
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:43,160
We'll be together,
Chris, together always.

888
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:58,926
- What'd the doctor say?

889
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,470
- Chris wouldn't have a doctor.

890
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,306
- You've got to be
logical about this.

891
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:05,141
- She's not badly hurt.

892
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:07,018
She's just bruised and shaken.

893
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:09,312
- Well, in the first place,
she's in a state of hysteria.

894
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:11,188
In the second place, she
shouldn't be in this house.

895
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,274
Everything in it
reminds her of Paul.

896
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:15,943
And finally, she shouldn't
be left alone for one second.

897
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:17,528
There's no telling
what she might do.

898
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:18,988
- But I'm with her all the time.

899
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:19,989
I haven't left...

900
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,369
Chris!

901
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:28,998
Chris!

902
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:48,517
Chris.

903
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,188
- Chris, are you all right?

904
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:53,564
- Yes, of course.

905
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:54,900
- What's in that bottle?

906
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:57,568
- It's just aspirin.

907
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:00,364
I've got a headache.

908
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,035
- Chris, it's dangerous
for you to stay here.

909
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:09,205
You need rest and care,
perhaps in a hospital.

910
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,207
- You're trying to separate us.

911
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,042
I won't go to a hospital.

912
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,168
I won't leave this house.

913
01:10:14,169 --> 01:10:15,249
- Only until you're better.

914
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,534
You'd try to drive
him away again.

915
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,508
Now get out.

916
01:10:20,509 --> 01:10:21,509
Get out.

917
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,973
- I'll leave before
I upset her any more.

918
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,018
- I'll see you to
the door, Martin.

919
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:38,734
- They've left the room.

920
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,237
- Then you can
resume the treatment?

921
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:42,738
- If you hadn't tried to
play the hero last night,

922
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,532
all this wouldn't be necessary.

923
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,575
- I had to save Janet, didn't I?

924
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,120
-You're not falling in
love with her, are you?

925
01:10:49,121 --> 01:10:51,205
- Look, if I'm going to
marry into this estate,

926
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:54,041
there's got to be
somebody for me to marry.

927
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,252
- Just by way of
making conversation,

928
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:58,421
that wife of mine in las
Vegas, the one who tried

929
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:01,590
to back out on me and wanted
the cash settlement back,

930
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,386
I settled with her,
but not for cash.

931
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:07,596
Now, if you should
back out on me,

932
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,473
I wouldn't hesitate to settle
with you either, Alexis.

933
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,602
-I know, because you're
in such a curious position.

934
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,614
- Paul?

935
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,459
- How long, Chris?

936
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,253
How long must I wait?

937
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,537
- Janet, get out of here.

938
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:57,498
- Why didn't you tell me
you wanted money that badly?

939
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,626
I'd have given it to
you just to get rid

940
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,381
- yes, I'm alive.

941
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:08,843
Legally I'm dead, I'm
going to stay that way.

942
01:13:08,844 --> 01:13:10,637
If you're alive, I
won't be able to.

943
01:13:12,222 --> 01:13:14,598
It's too bad you came
down here, Janet.

944
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,421
- Operator, get
me bradshaw 7425.

945
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,259
Martin, this is

946
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:57,266
- Operator.

947
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,443
- Chris, Chris, wake up.

948
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:11,197
I can't explain, quick,
we'll take the back stairs.

949
01:14:24,336 --> 01:14:25,836
- Paul.

950
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:40,643
You forgot, Paul.

951
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:43,521
My profession is
raising the dead.

952
01:15:14,302 --> 01:15:16,888
-You're losing quite a bit
of blood, aren't you Alexis?

953
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:23,353
- Spirits don't need any blood.

954
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:33,321
Do you think bullets
can harm us ghosts?

955
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:53,717
Too bad you missed.

956
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:56,927
Those were...

957
01:15:56,928 --> 01:15:58,388
Your last...

958
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:02,350
Two shots.

959
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:07,856
The police are here, my friend.

960
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:09,983
Your gun is empty.

961
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:14,028
For the police, you
have been privileged

962
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:16,405
to witness my best performance.

963
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:17,990
- You made one little mistake.

964
01:16:17,991 --> 01:16:19,826
I started with seven shells.

965
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,870
I have one in the chamber.

966
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:36,967
- Alexis, you were wonderful.

967
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:40,764
- Yes, I guess there must be
a better side to my nature.

968
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:44,099
But now you must forget me.

969
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,684
- No, never.

970
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:46,894
- I don't need a
crystal to see that

971
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:49,104
your future is bright, Janet.

972
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,066
Don't you go
clinging to the past.

973
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:56,362
I lived by feeding people's
desire to escape the present.

974
01:16:59,491 --> 01:17:02,077
But you can't escape for long.

975
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:05,079
-Alexis, I'm afraid for you.

976
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,290
- Oh, I'll be all right.

977
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:12,503
I'll find some spirits that
want to contact people.

978
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,677
Open the window, Janet, please.

979
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,062
Fly away, my friend.

980
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,440
I won't need you any more.
