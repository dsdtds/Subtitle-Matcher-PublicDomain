1
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,046
Flash.

2
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,008
Michel Marnay, the French heart-crusher
sailed incog tonight from Naples

3
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,342
on board the <i>Napoli.</i>

4
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:14,427
Why?

5
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,429
Because Lois Clarke
and her 20 million smackers

6
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,472
will be at the dock palpitating for him.

7
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,349
And it's good news for us mere men,

8
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:24,061
because when he arrives
Michel Marnay goes out of circulation.

9
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,980
This time, it's marriage.

10
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,951
Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,039
And a nice, crisp little tidbit
has just come in.

12
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:44,457
Oh, by the way, I might mention,

13
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,001
I am speaking from dear old London,
as usual.

14
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:52,673
Well, it's rumored that Michel Marnay
sails for America tonight

15
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,843
to enter into matrimony, at last,

16
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:59,764
with one of America's industrial nobility,

17
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,140
a Miss...

18
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,518
a Miss... Lois Clarke.

19
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,981
The rock and gravel heiress...
Stone and sand, you know.

20
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,868
Well, that seems to be all.

21
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,952
Good night.

22
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,044
- Signor Marnay?
- No.

23
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,505
Signor Marnay!

24
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,883
- Signor Marnay?
- No. Is he on board?

25
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:36,967
Yes.

26
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,427
Signor Marnay!

27
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,888
Signor Marnay!

28
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,724
Signor Marnay!

29
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,269
Signor Marnay!

30
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,024
Signor Marnay! Signor Marnay?

31
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,411
Mr. Marnay,
will you autograph this picture of you?

32
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,495
Please?

33
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,125
Write something we could always remember.

34
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,460
Something sizzling.

35
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,509
Thank you.

36
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,263
It's in French. Isn't it wonderful?
I wonder what it means.

37
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,934
"You are very lovely girls,
but you have very bad manners."

38
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,128
I beg your pardon?

39
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,672
I said I believe you're reading
my radiogram.

40
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,342
Just a moment.

41
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:06,390
Well... how do I know it's yours?
Can you identify yourself?

42
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,770
Well... I am Michel Marnay.

43
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,816
Oh, don't tell me you're the fella.

44
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,319
Yeah.

45
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,156
Well, this is--
this is pretty personal.

46
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,116
Can you tell me what it says?

47
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,954
Well, it says...

48
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,373
"Remembering a warm, beautiful night,

49
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,918
"a thunderstorm over Lake Como,

50
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,002
"and you."

51
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,253
"And you."

52
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,214
- That's you?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,509
It was all right, huh?

54
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,471
Was nice?

55
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,517
Thank you.

56
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,146
Do you think it'll ever
take the place of baseball?

57
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,478
What's the matter? Did you lose it again?

58
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,981
Look.

59
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,733
I'm in trouble. Serious trouble.

60
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:42,695
Well, I could have told you,
playing around Lake Como.

61
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,364
- The poor thing.
- No, no. I must talk to someone.

62
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,826
Well, I'm really not very good
about that sort of thing. I talk a lot.

63
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,620
- I've tried to break myself of the habit--
- You have an honest face.

64
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,705
Oh, you--

65
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,206
I can trust you, can't I?

66
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,001
Yes, I guess so.

67
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,085
Come with me.

68
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,254
But, look,
the captain has an honest face too.

69
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,299
And the purser, I thought he had
a very honest type of face.

70
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,723
Shall we go to your cabin or mine?

71
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,684
Mine.

72
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,688
- Well, maybe mine is closer.
- Mine is here.

73
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,190
Not that I'm prudish.

74
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,651
It's just that my mother told me
never to enter a man's room

75
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:24,361
in any month ending in R.

76
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,365
Your mother must be
a very beautiful woman.

77
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,621
- What's your name?
- Terry McKay.

78
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,499
Terry McKay. And I'm traveling alone.

79
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,129
That wasn't, by any chance,
what was troubling you, was it?

80
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,213
Yes.

81
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,260
- Oh-- Oh, this is fine.
- I thought you'd like it.

82
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,095
You saved my life, you know.

83
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,639
I was bored to tears.

84
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,850
I haven't seen one attractive girl
on this boat since we left.

85
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:59,271
Can you imagine? Nine days like that?
This is terrible. That's not for me.

86
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,606
Life should be bright.

87
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,108
It should be beautiful and bubbling,
like pink champagne.

88
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:07,738
I got scared. I said to myself,
"Don't beautiful women travel anymore?"

89
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,198
Evidently not.

90
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,450
Then I saw you and it was all right.

91
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,535
I was saved. I hope.

92
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,621
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

93
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,792
Have you been getting results
with a line like that?

94
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,627
Or would I be surprised?

95
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,838
But if you were surprised,
that would surprise me.

96
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,132
That sounds like a nasty crack.

97
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,094
- I could make a few too if I felt like it.
- I'm sure you could.

98
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,720
- I know I can.
- That's what I said.

99
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,640
I think I will. How's your fiancée?

100
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,017
She's got a cold.

101
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,353
Oh, that's too bad.

102
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,439
- Got it at Lake Como?
- No. No, she wasn't there.

103
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:47,611
Oh, you mean
the lady of the lake was not...

104
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,782
That was her best friend.

105
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,128
Chummy bunch.

106
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,796
Yeah.

107
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,967
Oh, this boat is going awfully fast.

108
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,804
Only eight and a half days till we get in.

109
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:18,600
Is there any reason why, from now on,
it shouldn't be pink champagne?

110
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,278
- Don't tell me he's the fellow.
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,282
He's all right, huh?

112
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,325
He's nice?

113
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,247
Where is he now?

114
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,332
Well, he's visiting his parents.

115
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,169
He sends me on a buying trip
every once in a while--

116
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,838
You see, he's my boss too.

117
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,680
You don't think he would approve
of pink champagne, do you?

118
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,973
- Oh, no, I don't...
- No...

119
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:03,103
Well, I think it's very touching,
you and him.

120
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,480
Very beautiful.

121
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,857
- I like that.
- Oh, I'm glad.

122
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,068
He must be a very fascinating fellow.

123
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,071
Oh, well,
you can just imagine how attractive he is

124
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:16,742
when I can resist
so charming a person as you.

125
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,203
Yes.

126
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,996
I think I'll go now.

127
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:27,002
After all, I still have deck tennis
and... keno,

128
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,546
and there is always shuffleboard.

129
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,550
- Don't tell me you're embarrassed.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

130
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,970
So if you don't mind,
I think I'll take my pride for a walk.

131
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,390
- Unless, by chance you care to have--
- Dinner? Oh, I'd love that.

132
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,851
- Oh, that would be very nice.
- Don't you think?

133
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:48,148
Instead of Mother Goose, you were probably
brought up on the memoirs of Casanova.

134
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,233
Not at all.

135
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,445
But y-you've heard of the little fella,
haven't you?

136
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,575
I imagine you've known quite a few women,
haven't you?

137
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,329
Or maybe "few"
is the wrong word.

138
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,291
And I gather you haven't
very much respect for them.

139
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,756
But you've always been very fair
in your judgment.

140
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,216
I beg pardon, signora.

141
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,261
Would you like me to reserve
this table for you every night?

142
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,388
Why not?

143
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,850
You know... I--

144
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,060
Look, look.
Let's talk about you now.

145
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,271
Oh, no, not tonight.

146
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,898
- Let's talk about me some other night.
- All right.

147
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,075
Signor Marnay.

148
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,581
Another one.

149
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,500
- And your name, please?
- McKay.

150
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,267
Eh, where were we?

151
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:10,022
Oh, yes. What's the name of that...
strange place you came from?

152
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,316
Kansas.

153
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,609
And from there?

154
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,988
Well, then I went to New York
and got a job singing in a nightclub

155
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,282
from 10:00 to 3:00 in the morning,

156
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,951
and then the manager used to
chase me around his office till 4:00,

157
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,119
and then I went home.

158
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,998
And then one night he came along.

159
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,124
Oh, yes.

160
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:34,212
Yeah. He said I didn't belong
in a place like that.

161
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,049
He said that...

162
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,718
I didn't say anything.

163
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,845
He said that... I--

164
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:45,182
- That you should improve yourself.
- Yeah. So I studied hard.

165
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,518
So that someday
you would be a charming and lovely wife.

166
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,521
Yeah, that was the idea, more or--
Is there anything wrong with that?

167
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,524
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Well, that's what I thought.

168
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,943
But nothing happened.

169
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,864
Well, that just about
brings us up to date.

170
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,699
Now my life's an open book.

171
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,952
It's only one page.

172
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,915
That's the only page.

173
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,878
I beg your pardon.

174
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,756
<i>Grazie.</i> Thank you very much.

175
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,424
Oh, that's bad.

176
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,596
- That's a beautiful camera you've got.
- Oh, yes.

177
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,807
- Takes very clear pictures--
- Oh, please, monsieur!

178
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,860
I guess it isn't any good
for either one of us to be seen together.

179
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,530
Right or wrong, you know,
people like to talk.

180
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,573
- Better be goodbye.
- What's the matter?

181
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,909
- Afraid?
- Of you? No.

182
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,412
Well, after all, we're on the same ship.

183
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,038
We still have eight days, you know.

184
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,499
Well, you can take nice,
long walks out in the sunshine.

185
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,042
What shall I do if it rains?

186
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,088
- No. It's no good.
- I see.

187
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,008
- It's particularly no good for you.
- Yes, that's right.

188
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:04,553
Being seen with you is news and
I don't wanna get my picture in the paper.

189
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,931
So we better spread out.

190
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,941
Hey. Hey.

191
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,693
Hey, get me down from here, will ya?

192
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,489
I got up there and I couldn't get back.

193
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,452
- Can you do that?
- Sure.

194
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,250
- Good. You're quite a fellow.
- Hey.

195
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,002
You must be quite a guy yourself.

196
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,420
Yes. Why?

197
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,297
Well, everybody on the ship's
talking about ya.

198
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,132
No! What do they say about me?

199
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,843
Well, I don't know, on account of
every time they start talking about you,

200
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,387
they make me leave the room,

201
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,181
Is that so?

202
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,653
Oh! Be careful there, sonny.
You'll fall and hurt yourself.

203
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,739
When I was little like you,
I fell and broke my leg.

204
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,240
How is it now?

205
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,950
It's all right.

206
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,660
Then what are you crabbing about?

207
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:15,332
Well, I-I'm not crabbing.
I just thought that you...

208
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,501
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,720
- Give me a champagne cocktail, will you?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:31,139
- Got cigarettes?
- At the cigarette stand, sir.

211
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,767
- Pink champagne?
- Yes.

212
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,903
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.

213
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,197
Have you any pink champagne?

214
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,281
Yes.

215
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,783
I changed my table to a table for one.

216
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,410
So did I.

217
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,747
It's too bad it had to be like that.
We had...

218
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,375
such a delightful dinner last night.

219
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,960
And...

220
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,129
<i>Parlez-vous igpay atinlay?</i>

221
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,673
- What was that?
- Well...

222
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,171
What is known as fooling the world.

223
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,466
Everybody's watching us.

224
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,470
- This is awful.
- What did you say?

225
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,556
I said this is awful
and I'm going to go.

226
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,895
- Don't you go too.
- I'm just watching you go.

227
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,438
I'll go.

228
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,512
Hello! Going my way?

229
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,431
- Calling on a lady.
- Oh, even in Madeira?

230
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,850
No, you're wrong this time.
My grandmother.

231
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,686
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

232
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,604
She lives up on the hill.

233
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,356
Would you like to meet her?

234
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,775
Yes, I'd be very happy to.
Come on, get in.

235
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,286
Oh, what a divine place.

236
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,916
Oh, it's perfect.

237
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,133
- Oh, I wanna meet her.
- Yes?

238
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,260
Just a minute.
I'll see if she's there.

239
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,013
Janou?

240
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,348
Janou?

241
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,853
She's not there.

242
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,359
Look.

243
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,613
She must be in the chapel.

244
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,949
Hello, Jacko.

245
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:20,910
Oh, hey. Still around?

246
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,801
What is it about this place?

247
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,681
There's something makes you feel
you ought to whisper.

248
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,518
Such peace.

249
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,438
It's like another world.

250
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,106
My grandmother's world.

251
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,359
Tell me a little more about her.

252
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,612
My grandfather
was in the diplomatic service.

253
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,614
They lived all over the world.

254
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,783
This was his last post.

255
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,326
He died here.

256
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,661
So she stayed on to be near him.

257
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,663
He's buried there near the chapel.

258
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,834
She must be waiting,
I think a little impatiently,

259
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,128
for the day she will join him.

260
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,928
Michel!

261
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,757
Oh, no. No, no.

262
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,927
May I present Miss Terry McKay.

263
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,513
She thought you were the girl
I'm going to marry.

264
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,223
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

265
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:10,228
Oh, pardon.

266
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,897
I was only saying I liked you very much.

267
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,108
Oh. Thank you. I'm glad.

268
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,653
If you'll excuse me,
I'll sit down for a moment.

269
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,198
I'm longer with my prayers these days.

270
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,410
And my knees, well,

271
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,704
they are as old as I am.

272
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,666
- Are you English?
- No, I'm an American.

273
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,334
American?

274
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:38,047
Do you know, my dear,
I have a special fondness for America.

275
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,009
It was my husband's
first post after we married.

276
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,760
Really?

277
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:47,182
In fact, we went to Washington
on our honeymoon.

278
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,896
- You have a lovely place here.
- Thank you.

279
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,024
I'd like to stay on forever.

280
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,067
You are too young for that.

281
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,029
It's a good place to sit and remember.

282
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,741
But you still have to
create your memories.

283
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,453
Would you like to go inside the chapel?

284
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,537
May I?

285
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,877
How long has it been for you, Michel?

286
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,006
Oh, let me see.

287
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,509
Since you were an altar boy?

288
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:25,803
Yes.

289
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,764
Then you'd better go in too.

290
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,599
- It won't hurt you.
- I know.

291
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,601
- I'll prepare tea.
- Good.

292
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,248
Never seen such lovely colors.

293
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,043
- Everything's so vivid.
- Yes.

294
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,961
Even the green seems greener.

295
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:23,963
Yes, they...

296
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,758
they get a lot of rainfall here.

297
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,556
- Who takes care of this place?
- Hmm? Oh, an old gardener--

298
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,183
- There he is. Well!
- Oh, Michel.

299
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,859
He's got three children
since I have seen him.

300
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:45,943
Really? Well!

301
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:50,823
Emile says, "France needs men,"
so he has seven daughters.

302
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,408
Seven?

303
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,618
<i>Oui!</i>

304
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,038
Well, if you'll excuse me, I think
I'm going to see the rest of the family.

305
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,251
Tea will be ready any moment.

306
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,671
- May I help you?
- Thank you, my dear.

307
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,219
- Where are your cups?
- In there.

308
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,194
- I'll carry it.
- Oh, thank you.

309
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,656
I'm sorry. I had to let my maid go.

310
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,158
I have to watch my expenses.

311
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:38,121
You see, I planned on dying when I was 75.

312
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,581
And here I am, 77.

313
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:45,086
So, if I am not going to die,
I have to start saving my money.

314
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,678
You like it?

315
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,347
Yes, it's charming.
Who did that?

316
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,142
Michel.

317
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,353
- Michel?
- He painted it for me.

318
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,357
Wh-- Why, it's good!

319
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,443
He's very talented.

320
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,445
Oh, forgive me.

321
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,822
You see,
I wouldn't have any way of knowing.

322
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,242
Unfortunately, he is also very critical.

323
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,246
As a result,
he hasn't done anything since.

324
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,206
What a pity.

325
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,461
Besides, Michel is too busy, mmm...

326
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,421
Living?

327
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,589
Thank you.

328
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,425
Things come too easy to him.

329
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,385
And he's always alone.

330
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,096
By the art, he is not practicing.

331
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,559
The places he hasn't been.
The girl he hasn't met.

332
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,897
I don't mind confessing to you, my dear,

333
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,065
that I've been worried about him.

334
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,692
Why?

335
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,529
That one day
life will present a bill to Michel,

336
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:57,158
and that he will find it hard to pay.

337
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:04,957
But when I-I see him with you,
I feel better.

338
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,336
Well, I don't understand.

339
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,839
He's going to be married
and settled down, and...

340
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,718
Can't you just see him
with his slippers and his pipe?

341
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,553
No.

342
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:24,852
There is many a slip
betwixt the leap and the altar,

343
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:28,940
and anything could happen on a boat.

344
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,609
Believe me, my dear,

345
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:36,572
there is nothing wrong with Michel
that a good woman could not make right.

346
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,122
Well, I saw Emile's entire family.

347
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,541
Seven daughters.

348
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:50,127
I congratulated him
and I had a nice talk with his wife.

349
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,921
How have you two girls been getting along?

350
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,297
You'd be surprised.

351
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,675
- I bet she did all the talking.
- Mm-hmm.

352
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,385
She told me that
when you were a little boy,

353
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,928
if you didn't get your own way,

354
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,181
you used to lie on the floor
and kick and get red in the face.

355
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,934
And what did you say?

356
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,855
Well, I said you didn't do that anymore.

357
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,316
Now if you don't get your own way,
you just get embarrassed.

358
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,660
What have you two been discussing?

359
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,663
Seems a lot has been going on
that I know nothing about.

360
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:39,010
Well, I'm afraid we must be going.

361
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,428
Michel.

362
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,390
See?

363
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,810
Janou, you must play the piano for us
before we go.

364
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,605
- Oh, no.
- She was a great pianist, you know.

365
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:53,274
- Come on, come on.
- She's going to play right now.

366
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,654
But, Michel, look at my hands.

367
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,449
That's it.

368
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,368
That's good.

369
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,956
Remember, I was asked to do this.

I don't like boat whistles.

381
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,206
I know. I know.

382
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:07,968
Here. Better have this around you.

383
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,386
Thank you.

384
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,138
Isn't it beautiful?

385
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,474
- You like it?
- Mmm, I do.

386
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,685
I'll send it to you someday.

387
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,857
This is as far as I can go.

388
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,611
This is the boundary of my small world.

389
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,697
It's a perfect world.

390
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,117
Thank you for letting me trespass.

391
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,577
Bye.

392
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,455
God bless you.

393
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:40,459
Well, Janou,
I'll come back to see you very soon.

394
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:41,836
I-I will.

395
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:45,047
And I shall write very often.
You'll see.

396
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,425
Please do.

397
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,225
Goodbye.

398
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,580
Goodbye.

399
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,668
Bye, Janou.

400
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,324
Looks like stormy weather ahead.

401
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,743
We've changed our course today.

402
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,496
I want to thank you for a lovely evening.

403
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,332
I want to thank you

404
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,294
for what was undoubtedly
the loveliest day I've ever known.

405
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,963
You've been very sweet
to my little grandmother.

406
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,133
- I'm going to write to her.
- Oh, that'd be nice.

407
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:15,054
Well, good night.

408
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,556
Good night.

409
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,248
We're heading into a rough sea, Michel.

410
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,002
Good night.

411
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:49,797
Good night.

412
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,753
You say "A penny for your thoughts",
I'll jump overboard.

413
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,465
I thought you'd gone to bed.

414
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,551
What good would that do? I can't sleep.

415
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:40,472
Yes, I know.
All I seem to do is turn and toss.

416
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:42,516
Dreaming?

417
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,852
Wouldn't call that dreaming.
I'm awake.

418
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:47,521
I'd call it wishing.

419
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,482
My father used to say,

420
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,402
"Wishes are the dreams we dream
when we're awake."

421
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,987
Oh, your father said that?

422
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,031
He drank a lot.

423
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,119
I wrote a song once about wishing.

424
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,290
- It was nice.
- Oh, it was?

425
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:10,002
Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean-- I mean it was..

426
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,712
You mean it was not bad?

427
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:15,215
You know, one day I'm going to
learn your language

428
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,967
and be very funny too.

429
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:20,012
I'm sorry. How does it go?

430
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,725
Oh, I forget.

431
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:29,605
But it meant if you wish very hard
with your mind,

432
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,859
and if you wish very strong in your heart,

433
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,404
and if you keep on wishing long enough
and strong enough--

434
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:40,407
- You get what you want for Christmas?
- Yes.

435
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,082
Well...

436
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,543
we get in in the morning.

437
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,506
Will he be waiting?

438
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:03,180
- Mm-hmm. And she?
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:15,567
I suppose if we have something
in our minds, we'd better say it now.

440
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,027
Yes.

441
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,906
You know,
I've never worked in all my life.

442
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,867
In all my life, I've never worked.

443
00:37:24,827 --> 00:37:26,578
I've been thinking about that.

444
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:36,755
- What did you say?
- Mmm? I didn't say anything.

445
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,173
You did too.

446
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:41,051
You said, "I was very fond
of expensive things.

447
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,887
"Furs and jewels and things."

448
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,597
D-Did I say that?

449
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:53,230
I guess you and I have been more or less
used to a life of pink champagne.

450
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,818
Maybe it'll be a little difficult to--

451
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,487
Do you like beer?

452
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,698
Yes, I do, but...

453
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,617
Oh, I know. It's bad for the figure.

454
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:11,290
My father used to say,
"It's a funny thing,

455
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:16,670
"but the things we like best
are either illegal, immoral or fattening."

456
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,090
I told you he drank like a fish.

457
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:30,434
I wonder what your father
would think of me.

458
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,480
Never working, not once.

459
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,442
Well, just because you haven't--

460
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,862
Oh, I didn't mean that I couldn't.
I know. Of course not.

461
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,531
But I couldn't find out all at once.

462
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:50,662
It would take me, oh,
at least six months to find out if...

463
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,499
- If what?
- Well, it's hard to say.

464
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,168
After all, it's unfair to ask you
to take a chance.

465
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,340
But... if I work hard enough
and long enough,

466
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,800
and if wishes came true,

467
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,677
where would you be?

468
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,846
What are you trying to say, Michel?

469
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,351
I'm trying to say that
it would take me six months to find out

470
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,771
if I'm worthy to say what's in my heart.

471
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,109
Oh, that's just about the nicest thing.

472
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,865
I think I'll turn in,

473
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,618
do a little more rolling and tossing and...

474
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:34,039
I'll think it over
and let you know in the morning.

475
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:40,712
- Going my way?
- No, I think I'll-- I'll walk a little.

476
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,721
Marriage is a very serious step
for a girl like me.

477
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,431
Yes, I know.

478
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,103
- You like children?
- Oh, yes, I do.

479
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:11,868
- I was so worried.
- I'm sorry. I didn't even know we were in.

480
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,329
I'm only half dressed.

481
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:19,793
Look, if everything turns out all right--
for both of us, I mean--

482
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,503
- In six months--
- Yes?

483
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,797
- That's July.
- July, yes.

484
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,425
I've written out these directions.

485
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:29,177
Read them carefully
so there won't be any mistake.

486
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,556
- "Darling, let's meet..."
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:40,731
"...July first, five o'clock, 102nd floor,
top of the Empire State Building."

488
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:45,944
Yes. That's it right there.
It's the tallest building in the world.

489
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,155
- You can't miss that.
- No.

490
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:51,158
It's the nearest thing to heaven
we have in New York.

491
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,329
Be sure you take the elevator.

492
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,833
Well, until we meet again...

493
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:02,628
take care of yourself.

494
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,497
Mr. Marnay,
any statement for the press?

495
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,957
Michael.

496
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,376
- So glad to see you.
- Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

497
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,003
- Did you have a nice crossing?
- I had a very nice crossing.

498
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,381
Miss Clarke?
Hold for a still, please.

499
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,924
Yes.

500
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,260
Thank you. One more, please.

501
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,970
Oh... yes.

502
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,056
That's it. That's fine.
One more, Miss Clarke, please.

503
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:42,102
- Will this do?
- That's fine, Miss Clarke.

504
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:45,021
- Thank you.
- I'm awfully sorry. I beg your pardon.

505
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,066
If you will excuse me,
I have an appointment.

506
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,612
Oh, Michael, I'm so glad you're back.
No more. No more.

507
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:57,826
Let me look at you.

508
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,620
Oh, it's wonderful to have you back.
Rough crossing?

509
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,873
Well, you wouldn't exactly call it smooth.

510
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,709
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Oh, excuse us.

511
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,544
Really, darling,
it's great to have you back.

512
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,380
Well, it's great to be back, Ken.

513
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:07,187
Your trunk has arrived.
Where's the key?

514
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,689
Don't unpack, Annie.

515
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,318
I'm moving.

516
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:32,295
- Well, lots of good luck.
- Thanks.

517
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,047
I hope you'll be working here.

518
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,800
The terms are satisfactory,
but as I said before--

519
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,261
I know. It's not up to you,
it's up to the customer.

520
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,138
That's right.
You sing, then we'll talk further.

521
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:47,060
- And if I can't find you, I'll understand.
- That's right.

That noise is applause, isn't it?

548
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,167
Oh, well, maybe they're applauding
your two-dollar dinner.

549
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,921
I'd like to talk a long contract.

550
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:22,549
- Six months?
- That's not a long time.

551
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,342
Oh, yes, it is.

Oh, I brought you something.

566
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,495
You're always so nice to me.

567
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,956
Nice? But you are my nicest boarder.

568
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,043
Well, no matter what you say,
I'm not going to pay you a cent more.

569
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:46,216
Who wants more money?
I am so happy you are here.

570
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:49,094
You're always happy. What's the secret?

571
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:52,764
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

572
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:56,559
My place is half empty,
I have rheumatism,

573
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:59,354
and my husband left me with five children

574
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,397
and they're all ashamed of me.

575
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,274
I don't kn--

576
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,319
Oh, I'm sorry.

577
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:10,115
Oh, you shouldn't be sorry,
you should be happy.

578
00:49:10,198 --> 00:49:14,077
There is no boyfriends calling on you
so you don't get married.

579
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,457
And if you don't get married,
your children won't be ashamed of you.

580
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,418
Well, good night. Don't you eat late,
because it's bad for you.

581
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:25,255
Good night.
I'm not going to worry about anything.

582
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,216
Oh, you know, I joke a lot about marriage,

583
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,260
but it can be a beautiful thing.

584
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,762
You know, you should get married
if you find the right man.

585
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:35,932
Well, of course I don't know
when you will find him, of course,

586
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,685
but don't you marry a loafer like I did.

587
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:41,688
It's just as easy to marry a man
with lots of money.

588
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,231
Maybe you don't love him at first,

589
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,568
but you can teach yourself
in six easy lessons.

590
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,238
Just don't you marry a loafer.
I married one. He was a prize-winner.

591
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,378
Yep.

592
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,678
I was hoping you would like one of...

593
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:19,184
Well, I suppose if I don't
sell my paintings, I'll get a job.

594
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,728
Oh, I wouldn't give up painting.
Why, painting--

595
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,397
I'm not going to give it up.
This is the only thing I know.

596
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,399
But I've got to make money.
A lot of money.

597
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:27,942
Of course, of course.

598
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,028
Well, in order to make money,
you must eat.

599
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,989
Even the new Marnay gets hungry,
you know.

600
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,841
Michel.

601
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:53,843
Michel!

602
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,806
I have good news for you.

603
00:50:58,890 --> 00:50:59,891
What?

604
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,019
- I sold one.
- Which one?

605
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,147
The woman.

606
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,858
I got $100 for her.

607
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,712
- What are you so happy about?
- I'm a painter.

608
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,923
So am I, but I ain't happy.

609
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:02,203
Miss McKay, my dear, my favorite customer.
Welcome home.

610
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,247
- Thank you.
- How well you're looking.

611
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,916
Yes, I know. I didn't get it here.

612
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,002
- Where have you been all these months?
- Out of town.

613
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,461
My dear, we've missed you.

614
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,672
- Well, I've missed you too, Miss...
- Lane.

615
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:17,218
Miss Lane, I want to get
something so beautiful...

616
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:19,595
Simple, you understand, but breathtaking.

617
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,056
Oh, of course. Miss Webb,
look who's back.

618
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:26,060
Oh, Miss McKay. We were just saying,
"Whatever happened to Miss McKay?"

619
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,730
- And here you are.
- Isn't it wonderful?

620
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:32,734
Miss McKay is here,
and we were just wondering--

621
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,111
Miss McKay is there?

622
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,531
Well, give her anything in the shop,
but hold her till I get there, will ya?

623
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,616
You weren't worried
about her credit, were ya?

624
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:44,871
Yes.
Yes, that's what we were wondering.

625
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,707
I knew you'd understand, Mr. Bradley.

626
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,208
Thank you so much.

627
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,090
I don't think you could
make a mistake on either one.

628
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,552
Oh... excuse me, please.

629
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,888
Where shall we have this sent?

630
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,640
Well, I don't know at the moment.
I'll have to call back and let you know.

631
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:08,227
- I think that's right, isn't it?
- No-- no charge?

632
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:09,395
No, no.

633
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,647
- No?
- No, no. I know, I know.

634
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:14,233
No. No. No.

635
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:17,070
Oh, goodbye, Miss McKay!

636
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:20,406
- Do come back again soon.
- Yes, don't stay away so long, my dear.

637
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,783
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

638
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,576
Bye, Miss Lane.

639
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,746
- Terry.
- Ken, what are you doing here?

640
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:29,332
How on Earth did you know I was here?

641
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,877
Oh. Oh, I see.

642
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,671
- What time is it, Ken? I'm late.
- Five minutes to 5:00.

643
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:37,673
- It's good to see you, Ken.
- It's wonderful to see you again.

644
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:39,926
I've got so much to talk to you about.
Can't we go someplace?

645
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,512
- I'm in a hurry.
- But I've got so much to say.

646
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,555
Well, call me up sometime.

647
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:47,266
No, you can't do that either
when I'm going to to be marri--

648
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,435
- Then you are going to--
- Yes, Ken, and I'm late.

649
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,146
- What time did you say it was?
- Four minutes of 5:00.

650
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,066
Looks like I came all the way down here
just to tell you what time it was.

651
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,317
Yes.

652
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,861
- Goodbye, Ken.
- Goodbye.

653
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:01,864
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Ken.

654
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:04,951
You can imagine how excited I am.

655
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:08,246
I thought 34th Street was that way
and it's down here.

656
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,876
I'll pay you more if I get out here.
I'm in a hurry.

657
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,421
There you are.

658
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,257
- What's the rush?
- I'm going to be married.

659
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,801
And I'd like you to be the first
to congratulate me.

660
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,386
Thank you so much.

661
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:13,936
- Going down?
- No.

662
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,795
- Going down?
- No.

663
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,923
What time have you got?

664
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,759
- Ten after 5:00.
- Okay.

665
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:20,878
Going down?

666
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:23,506
Yeah.

667
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,029
Doctor.

668
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,160
What do you think?

669
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,122
Her X-rays aren't very encouraging.

670
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,457
It's hard to say
if she'll ever walk again.

671
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,752
We can tell better in about six months.

672
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,173
Are you the fellow she was yelling about
under the anesthetic?

673
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,884
No, no. That's--
That's another chap.

674
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,096
She was on her way to marry him.

675
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,681
Has he been notified?

676
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,183
No. She--
She doesn't want that.

677
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:21,022
Because until she knows what you say
you won't know for six months,

678
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,940
she'd rather he didn't know.

679
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:25,776
That's being sensible. Nice girl.

680
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,737
I think so.

681
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,072
Excuse me.

682
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,751
Well, we weren't sure whether or not
we'd have you with us today.

683
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,383
Father, this is the man I....

684
00:57:50,426 --> 00:57:52,928
- He and I--
- Yes. He explained.

685
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:57,933
Then you know I was on my way
to be married.

686
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,105
While I was on my way to be a good girl,

687
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:08,653
I got hit right in the intersection
of 34th and 5th.

688
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,451
Wasn't anybody's fault but my own.

689
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,873
I had an appointment way up.

690
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,251
I didn't wanna keep him waiting.

691
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:30,216
Oh, it could have been beautiful.

692
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:35,221
Marriage, I mean. Children.

693
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,696
Forgive me, Father. I'm a little weak.

694
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,740
I don't get a lot of exercise.

695
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,324
Janou?

696
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,664
Janou?

697
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:51,756
Janou?

698
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,950
Monsieur Michel,
she gave me this to send to you.

699
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,786
I was going to mail it today.

700
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:07,915
She said it was for the young lady
that was here with you.

Hello, Miss McKay.

711
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:21,572
Oh, hello.

712
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,908
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right. How are you?

713
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,452

Fine.

01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,124
- Oh.

Oh, I bet it is.

718
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,629

01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:37,880

01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:38,964

721
01:02:39,048 --> 01:02:40,716
I knew mine yesterday.

722
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,092
- Is that so?
- Hey, don't.

723
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,553
Oh, come on, come on.
Come on, let's try it.

724
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:48,223
I've been practicing too.
Wait'll you hear me.

725
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:50,017

- How long has this been going on?
- Only a few days.

744
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:32,202
- I hope you're not angry.
- Oh, no, no.

745
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:35,039
But when you have as many youngsters
on your hands as I have,

746
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,833
you have a problem.

747
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,920
Oh, I don't know. I like them.

748
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:44,882
I do too, but they don't like me.

749
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,509
They call me Picklepuss.

750
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,223
At heart, they're just little savages.

751
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:57,853
But music, you know, has the charms
to sooth the savage breast.

752
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,688
And if it has such an influence,

753
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:03,150
and if you can do so much
in a few days, I'm thinking...

754
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:07,279
I wonder if you're thinking
the same thing I am.

755
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:12,409
Music has charms, and I like children,
and children like me, and...

756
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,288
I'll be getting out of here pretty soon.

757
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:21,752
And when I do,
I'll be needing a job badly.

758
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:24,088
It will be only an experiment,
you understand.

759
01:05:24,171 --> 01:05:26,006
- Yes, I know.
- We can't pay high.

760
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,633
Oh, I know, I know.

761
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,638
Just so you'll pay me enough
that I don't go around

762
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:34,515
calling you Picklepuss.

763
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:42,815
I'd like to give them a surprise.

764
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,858
So if you don't say anything,
I won't say anything.

765
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:46,151
I won't say a word.

766
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:49,571
We won't tell anybody!
We'll keep your secret!

767
01:06:06,797 --> 01:06:09,424
I must say, you've become
a better painter, my friend.

768
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,343
Maybe you've become a better critic.

769
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:14,429
Six months of hard work.

770
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:17,349
Well, I'm glad you haven't
wasted your time, my friend.

771
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:20,060
I've sold everything but this.

772
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:23,772
I told them to take it out of the window
since you telephoned to me.

773
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:26,108
- This is the best, I think.
- Yes.

774
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:28,569
I'm not exactly ashamed of it myself.

775
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,904
You don't want to sell it, eh?

776
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,948
No, no, I don't want to sell it.

777
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,950
I wouldn't mind getting rid of it,

778
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,536
but... somehow I don't want to--
to take money for it.

779
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:42,583
I thought maybe you were keeping it
because... you were--

780
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,793
you were nursing a broken heart.

781
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:47,921
Oh, no. No.

782
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,465
Broken heart is not for me.

783
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,970
Life is what you make it, Colbert.

784
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:58,599
From now on,
I'm taking my fun where I find it.

785
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,351
- Oh.
- Well, I'll be seeing you soon again.

786
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:02,686
- Mm-hmm.
- Goodbye.

787
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,982
- Merry Christmas, Colbert.
- Merry Christmas to you, my friend.

788
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,744
Michael!

789
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:22,164
I heard you were in town.
I've had a terrible time running you down.

790
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,959
Ah, you've been gone a long time, <i>mon ami,</i>

791
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:28,795
and I've been thinking of you
morning, noon and night

792
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,547
and in-between times.

793
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:33,008
What?

794
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:37,262
I know you've been busy, but you could
make the theater tonight, couldn't you?

795
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:38,847
Well, I'll leave a ticket at your hotel.

796
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:58,200
Where shall we go from here?

797
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:01,286
Why, Michael...
That's up to you.

798
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,038
After all, this is your evening.

799
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,748
I don't know where to go anymore.

800
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,208
I just came back, you know.

801
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,765
Hello.

802
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,058
Hello.

803
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:39,449
- Let me tell him. I'll go get him.
- No. No. No.

804
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,209
It's tough.

805
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:52,462
The first time you're able to get out
and you have to meet him.

806
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:58,385
All I could say was, "Hello."

807
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,237
Well, the show's over.
The boy got the girl.

808
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,613
Shall we go?

809
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,722
Seems terrible taking you home
with everybody going out.

810
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,684
I'm going to ask you once more.
Why don't you let me help you?

811
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:49,686
And I'm going to tell you once more.

812
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:53,023
If I let you finance my getting well,
he wouldn't like it.

813
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:54,649
And if he wouldn't like it, I wouldn't.

814
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:58,070
And if you did get me well
and I went to him, you wouldn't like it.

815
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,821
Well, then certainly he ought to know.

816
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:03,075
No, because if he found out,
he'd want to do something about it.

817
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:04,993
And then if I didn't get well,

818
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:07,996
he wouldn't like it and I wouldn't like it
and you wouldn't like it

819
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,707
and it would be awful.

820
01:10:11,249 --> 01:10:13,919
No, unless I can walk to him one day--

821
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:17,964
and when I say "walk,"
I mean "run" — he'll never know.

822
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,384
But I've got my job now
and I'm on a budget

823
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:24,888
and if everything works out all right
and I'm a good little girl,

824
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,182
maybe I'll get what I want next Christmas.

825
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:35,607
Well, thank you, Lois.
Good night.

826
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,610
Sure you don't want to come with us?
The evening is so young and everything.

827
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,238
No, I think I'll turn in.
Some other time.

828
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,781
Merry Christmas, everybody.

829
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:47,536
Taking you to the theater
wasn't a very good idea, was it, Michael?

830
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,080
No.

831
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,624
Merry Christmas, Lois.

832
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,585
- Merry Christmas, Michael.
- Thank you.

833
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:24,781
What's the matter, buddy?
Feeling sorry for yourself?

834
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:27,701
Yeah.

835
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:29,911
You don't know what troubles are.

836
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:39,588
Look at me.

837
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:43,967
I live on 186th Street
and they won't let me on the subway.

838
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,763
Oh, excuse me, ladies.

839
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:54,978
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.

840
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,439
- She's not feeling very well.
- Oh, that's too bad.

841
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,358
- But she wants to see you. Go on in.
- Thank you.

842
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,029
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

843
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:06,364
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, thanks!

844
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:09,910
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning, Miss McKay.

845
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,329
Hello. Hello.

846
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,206
I have bad news for you.

847
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,790
Doctor says I can't go.

848
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,170
Look, Doctor, I can be back
in a couple of hours.

849
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,924
This is a Christmas benefit.
It's their first public appearance.

850
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:25,383
This is my team.

851
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:26,760
She's our coach, Doc.

852
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,428
Doctor.

853
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:32,807
Doctor.

854
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,685
If it's gonna hurt her,
you wouldn't want her to go, would ya?

855
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:37,103
No.

856
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,899
You really don't need the piano.

857
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,235
Come on.
Go through it once without me.

858
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:46,154
The only place you might get stuck
is right at the beginning.

859
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,157
And Aloysius can sing an A in his sleep.
Can't ya, Al?

860
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:51,159
- Sure.
- Come on. Let's hear it.

861
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:58,625
See? Now ready. One, two.

Where's Patty Jane?

864
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:07,217
She's got a sore throat
and she won't be able to go on the stage.

865
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,344
Aw. Come here, darling.

866
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:12,722
Oh, a pretty new dress too.

867
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,850
- Hello, Miss McKay.
- Aw.

868
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:18,019
You really wanna go on the stage?

869
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:19,604
Then I tell you what you do.

870
01:13:19,688 --> 01:13:22,607
You go right along with the rest of them
and you pretend to sing.

871
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:24,401
You know, make-believe.
Like this.

872
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,238
They'll never know
the difference.

Now go on. Go out here and fight
for good ol' Washington Heights.

01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,479
Merry Christmas!

900
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,981
Goodbye. Goodbye. Good luck. Goodbye.

901
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:30,276
- Merry Christmas to you, Miss McKay.
- Thank you.

01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:35,615
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Patty.

903
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:45,333
Well, this isn't going to be much
of a Christmas for you, is it?

904
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:47,001
No, I guess not.

905
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,547
Oh, wait.

906
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:52,674
There.

907
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:53,800
Thank you.

908
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,635
Are you comfortable?

909
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:57,345
Yes, I'm all right.

910
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,224
If you want anything, you just call.

911
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:02,308
I will.

912
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,563
Michel.

913
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:11,943
Hello.

914
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,741
How are you, Terry?

915
01:16:19,159 --> 01:16:20,785
Good to see you.

916
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:23,955
Yes. It's good to see you too.

917
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,213
Feeling all right?

918
01:16:32,297 --> 01:16:35,300
Oh, yes, I'm fine. I'm just resting.

919
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:40,430
It's been a long time.

920
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,141
Yes. Yes, that's right.

921
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,395
- Good to see you.
- Yes, you said that.

922
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,899
- May I?
- Oh, yes, yes. Sit down.

923
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,400
Thank you.

924
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,944
I will only be a minute.

925
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,867
You sure you don't mind that...

926
01:17:03,745 --> 01:17:05,747
I bet you're wondering how I got here.

927
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,960
I was looking in the telephone book
for a man named McBride

928
01:17:11,044 --> 01:17:13,838
when I saw the name of Terry McKay.

929
01:17:13,922 --> 01:17:15,423
So I said to myself,

930
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:18,676
"Could that be Terry McKay, my old friend?"

931
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,012
And it was.

932
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:22,514
Yes.

933
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:28,228
Then I said to myself,
"I haven't been very nice to Miss McKay.

934
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,731
"After all, I had an appointment
with her one day at...

935
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:40,782
"And... I didn't keep it."

936
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:51,167
That wasn't a very nice way
to treat an old friend, was it?

937
01:17:53,044 --> 01:17:54,045
No.

938
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:01,636
So I said to myself, "I must apologize."
And here I am.

939
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:05,265
- Well, that's sweet of you.
- Yes, I think so.

940
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:08,852
I often wondered about you, how you were.

941
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:11,312
Oh, you did? Really?

942
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:14,274
Well, I often wondered about you too.

943
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:20,655
So, you didn't get angry
because I wasn't there?

944
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:23,658
Oh, well, what do you think?

945
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:25,952
Well, you must have been at first.

946
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,871
- Well, yes, I-I was.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

947
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:30,248
At first I was furious.

948
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:33,418
I said,
"He can't do a thing like this to me.

949
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:35,128
"Who does he think he is?"

950
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,339
And how long did you--
I mean, did you wait long?

951
01:18:40,008 --> 01:18:43,845
Well, let's see,
I-I waited until about...

952
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,139
Midnight?

953
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,269
And then what did you do?

954
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,899
Oh, well, then I was really mad.

955
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:57,901
You can just imagine up there.

956
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,529
In a thunderstorm.

957
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:03,990
Yes.

958
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:06,701
And then what did you say to yourself?

959
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:10,663
Well, then I said,
"Why don't you go home and get tight?"

960
01:19:12,624 --> 01:19:14,709
- You didn't do that.
- Didn't I?

961
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:21,466
Maybe you took a little one
every hour for about a month.

962
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:25,345
- Well, can you blame me?
- I should say not.

963
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,348
The least I could have done
was to send you a note.

964
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:33,478
Well, maybe when you thought about it,
you didn't know a way to reach me.

965
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:44,822
But you swore that
if you ever saw me again, you'd ask.

966
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:48,493
You didn't?

967
01:19:48,576 --> 01:19:49,786
No.

968
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:55,416
No, I remembered we said
i-if we could make it, we'd be there.

969
01:19:56,209 --> 01:20:00,672
And if one of us didn't show up,
there must have been a darn good reason.

970
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:01,881
Like what, for instance?

971
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:04,759
And the other one shouldn't ask questions.

972
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,719
Asking questions is--

973
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,972
Life must be bright.

974
01:20:09,055 --> 01:20:12,225
We must keep it beautiful
and bubbling like pink champagne.

975
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:17,605
So there'll be no questions asked, I hope.

976
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:25,863
Cigarette?

977
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,118
Thank you.

978
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:34,288
Thank you.

979
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:46,968
Think of me walking all the way up here,
ten blocks to...

980
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:55,810
And instead, I promise not even
to ask you why you didn't show up.

981
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,062
You knew I was planning to.

982
01:20:58,146 --> 01:21:01,357
- Doesn't seem fair somehow.
- I know.

983
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:05,111
I don't know what it is,
but when I'm with you, I--

984
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,447
Well...

985
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,491
Well, anyway...

986
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,002
No wedding ring?

987
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,171
No.

988
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:25,173
Well, I thought when I saw you at the...

989
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:27,508
At the theater last night?

990
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:30,011
No, he was-- No.

991
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,055
I didn't mean to offend you.

992
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,767
How's everything with you, Michel?

993
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:38,811
Oh, so you can ask questions.

994
01:21:39,604 --> 01:21:40,938
Yeah.

995
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:44,609
Well, I thought everything was fine
until I saw you last night.

996
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:47,653
Then I knew there must be something
between us.

997
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,282
Even if only a notion.

998
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,078
So I bought myself a ticket.

999
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:58,456
Sailing?

1000
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:02,001
Yes. Tonight.

1001
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,884
Yep.

1002
01:22:11,636 --> 01:22:12,637
Well...

1003
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:19,811
You're happy, aren't you?

1004
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:24,148
Mm-hmm.
And you?

1005
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:26,400
Well, I don't know.

1006
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:30,279
I'm worried about the future,
what people will think of me.

1007
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:33,199
They'll say,
"There he goes. The mad painter.

1008
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,326
"There must be something
the matter with him.

1009
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:38,079
"He doesn't like women."

1010
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:45,294
You mean he won't even speak to them?

1011
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:48,131
Oh, yes, yes, he sails the seven seas,

1012
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:50,925
and to every woman he meets, he says,

1013
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,469
"Where will you be in six months?"

1014
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:55,596
- And they're there?
- Everywhere.

1015
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,724
Eiffel Tower, Pyramids. Everywhere.
Waiting.

1016
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,269
But he didn't? Where is he?

1017
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:02,979
Waiting.

1018
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,864
- You want to change the subject, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1019
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,409
Merry Christmas.

1020
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:19,287
Oh, I almost forgot.

1021
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:22,874
Well, six months ago,

1022
01:23:22,957 --> 01:23:24,750
who would have thought
we'd spend Christmas together?

1023
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:28,045
- By the way, I have a present for you.
- A present?

1024
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:30,673
Oh, well, I wish I had something for you.

1025
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,092
Well, you didn't know I was going to...

1026
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:36,971
Anyway, it's not really
a Christmas present.

1027
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:47,023
So that's why my letters came back.

1028
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,338
She wanted you to have it.
Remember?

1029
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,092
Yes, I remember.

1030
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:17,887
I would have sent it to you,

1031
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:21,682
only I didn't know your address
until today, so...

1032
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,144
Well, goodbye, Terry.

1033
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:28,940
Goodbye, Michel.

1034
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:45,373
Well...

1035
01:24:51,379 --> 01:24:54,215
You know, I painted you like that.

1036
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:57,885
With the shawl. I wish you'd seen it.

1037
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:02,890
Colbert says-- He's my dealer.
He says it's the best thing I've done.

1038
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:06,394
I didn't think I would ever part with it,

1039
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:09,814
but there was no reason
for keeping it anymore.

1040
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,608
And then he told me about a girl
who came into his shop.

1041
01:25:12,692 --> 01:25:14,485
He told me she liked it very much.

1042
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:18,823
I suppose she saw in it,
well, what I hoped you'd see.

1043
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:22,076
So I told him to give it to her
because he said she was poor,

1044
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,537
and not only that, he told me that she...

1045
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:33,879
He told-- He said--

1046
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,881
Yes?

1047
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:40,636
Anyway, I-I told him to give it to her.

1048
01:25:41,595 --> 01:25:46,934
Yes, she couldn't afford it,
and it was Christmas season,

1049
01:25:47,018 --> 01:25:50,521
and you know me — bighearted Michel.

1050
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,857
What time does your boat sail?

1051
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,108
Boat?

1052
01:26:56,837 --> 01:26:58,631
Why didn't you tell me, Terry?

1053
01:26:58,714 --> 01:26:59,965
Darling.

1054
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:07,515
If anything had to happen to one of us,
why did it have to be you?

1055
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:11,018
Oh, don't look at me like that.

1056
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:14,397
It wasn't anybody's fault but my own.

1057
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:20,653
I was looking... up at the 102nd floor.

1058
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,824
It was the nearest thing to heaven.

1059
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:28,869
You see, you were there.

1060
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,292
Don't worry.

1061
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:38,045
It doesn't have to be a miracle.

1062
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:43,551
If you can paint, I can walk.

1063
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:49,265
- Anything can happen, don't you think?
- Yes, I think so.
